That at least offered students a vacation from science class which is more than can be said for the fate of audiences attending Christopher Nolans latest round of effects-driven high-tech intergalactic mumbo-jumbo. With no costumes other than space suits for his characters to hide behind brainiac Nolan displays a mastery of the space-time continuum while once again finding it impossible to pen a coherent third act. ERs across the country had best stock up on brain specialists to care for the sudden rash of exploding heads this too-hip-for-the-galaxy space opera will foster among fanboys. There are many words to describe Interstellar. Entertainment isnt one of them.

Titles Interstellar Names Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway Characters Cooper Still of Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway in Interstellar (2014)(Photo Melinda Sue Gordon)""Interstellar"" is the biggest and boldest movie of the year and also its most mystifying. Its a nearly three-hour event movie about quantum physics with deep philosophical quandaries about fate the universe and our place in it. So who wants popcorn?It may well be the headiest blockbuster ever made a literal deconstruction of time and space with a script that often feels like one of those complex equations that fill up entire chalkboards in movies. Thought ""Gravity"" was too simplistic with its handling of the mechanics of outer space? ""Interstellar"" is like advanced trigonometry which will please Neil deGrasse Tyson but will likely leave those without a complex understanding of astrophysics feeling cold.""Interstellar"" comes from writer-director Christopher Nolan who has dedicated himself to making bigger better smarter blockbusters since he was handed the keys to the ""Batman"" franchise back in 2005. In between his second and third ""Batman"" movies he made ""Inception"" a hugely ambitious rumination on dreams wrapped inside a riveting pulse-pounding action film. It was 2010s best movie mainly because it dared to present ideas and play with the audiences heads in summertime that most mindless of movie seasons.""Inception"" asked a lot of viewers but its most confounding moments are a mere jumping off point for ""Interstellar."" (Think of it as ""Interstellarception."") Its perhaps unfair to grouse about the brainlessness of movies like ""Transformers"" and then get frustrated with a movie as challenging as ""Interstellar"" but ""Interstellar"" goes way off the deep end. Nolan is wrestling with issues of artistic ambition vs. audience expectations but he errs on the wrong side and leaves viewers behind as he takes off for the cosmos. Hey Chris do us a favor and let us know when you come back down to Earth OK?Matthew McConaughey is Cooper a widower with a teenage son (Tom) and a pre-teen daughter (Murph) living in Americas heartland or at least whats left of it. They live in a near-future where food is scarce massive dust storms are making the planet uninhabitable and NASA scientists are working in secret to find a new planet or universe to colonize. Cooper is a former NASA pilot who is recruited to head up a mission to scope out new planets but to do so he must leave his children behind. He does -- Murph takes it very hard -- and heads to the far reaches of the galaxy with a crew that includes fellow pilots Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and Doyle (Wes Bentley) as well as a pair of robots.As Cooper and his crew head off they explore the time-space continuum gravitational pulls wormholes black holes and at one point the chemical properties of love; the dialogue is at times so alienating it feels like youre eavesdropping on a conversation between nuclear scientists. (For homework there are stacks of literary references to wade through from Dylan Thomas to Stephen King to Arthur Conan Doyle.)Nolans visuals are impeccable and Hans Zimmers walloping score pounds with urgency. The performances are solid across the board especially from McConaughey who is sturdy strong and cool as the movies hero. ""Interstellar"" is likely to spark strong debates from supporters and quick dismissals from naysayers while stoners will spend countless viewings searching for which Yes album it syncs to seamlessly.""Interstellar"" is a grand undertaking but in shooting for the stars it loses its footing. It goes to infinity and beyond when infinity would have been plenty.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaInterstellarGRADE CRated PG-13 For some intense perilous action and brief strong languageRunning time 169 minutes 70 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1tYXmKT MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/11/04/interstellar-infinity-beyond-reason/18488285/,200,interstellar1,interstellar,detroitnews

Nice work Richard Amysaid on Thursday December 18 2014 80656 PMLet me get this straight people that are too dumb to follow the film are saying that its bad? That is hilarious. If you think its a flop then that probably means you just need to learn a little about theoretical physics. Interstellar is the best film Ive ever seen . Jevonwillson said on Sunday December 14 2014 84938 PMI dont usually post my thoughts online about a movie but this is by far the best movie Ive seen in a very long time. Very cerebral and touching. People that shoot it down are not smart enough to appreciate this work of art Jay huntsaid on Friday November 28 2014 93538 AMWell Mr. Roeper you really got it wrong this time. Interstellar is a 2001 knockoff with better FXs. Great acting weak story and so many plot holes I cant see why you did not notice. Not only does it have the worst soundtrack Ive ever heard its boring and mumbling throughout. I call it a Noahs arc of ideas which sank in 3 hours. Interstellar was long anticipated and disappointingly second rate. Out of 5 I give it a 3. Watch it again Mr. Roeper. You obviously fell asleep in the first half hour. Davidsaid on Friday November 28 2014 91141 AMI dont understand how this movie is different from Transformers with very accurate mechanical engineering designs. Its a very cliched love solves all movie with a jumpy story that doesnt come together well with its underdeveloped characters. I mean does anybody really believe the thoroughly incompetent Anne Hathaway is one of humanitys 4 chosen astronauts to save the planet? Would super advanced humans really have to construct a tesseract dissecting time and space and rely on finger wiggling when they could have sent a simple fax to NASA headquarters? How could they possibly not notice the planet was covered in water before they landed? Dozens of other questions popped through my mind during the film although they were not silly questions like ""does love really transcend time"" that some others seemed to have. Despite the magnificent visuals and my love of the sci-fi genre I can only give this film a 7/10. Nadia Sattarsaid on Sunday November 23 2014 122058 PMINTERSTELLAR - it was a promised ""nirvana for movie lovers"" amp; after having experienced it the involuntary AAAHHHH of visual satisfaction was inescapable The senses explode with the powerful imagery that cannot be OVERSTATED even as the mind glosses over the story thats pieced together Yes No question...only in Hollywood Stevesaid on Saturday November 15 2014 94156 PMI I usually agree with your reviews to a fair degree but not on this one. I am not a big fan of either lead so that doesnt help. The visuals are very good but the directing was less than inspired. It is obvious this was meant to be the next great brainy space movie since 2001 but it hardly delivers. The music crescendo into loud organ chords repeatedly cranked up to ridiculous levels often making dialogue unintelligible. I could go on but suffice to say this is more of a B overall. Some high points along with some low points. Ben Sonasaid on Friday November 14 2014 40538 PMI cant believe you gave this bloated poorly executed excuse for a movie an A+. I would only recommend this movie to those looking for eye candy and a brainless premise. What a disaster Zach Gsaid on Wednesday November 12 2014 14632 PMYou didnt even mention the incredible soundtrack Lisasaid on Monday November 10 2014 64001 AMI didnt like the film at all it was hard to follow and half the time they mumbled and you couldnt understand a thing they were saying.

Jones The Bleader Film November 05 2014 Movies | Movie Review Tweet Pin It Reprints Share Matthew McConaughey goes nowhere fast in Interstellar The new sci-fi epic from Christopher Nolan is long on ideas but short on story. By Ben Sachs 1bsachs Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar Interstellar   Directed by Christopher Nolan On a visual level Interstellar is an exceptionally well-crafted Hollywood entertainment. Director Christopher Nolan art director Dean Wolcott and their effects artists render the imaginary settings in stunning detail. The film is rife with brilliant imagery a horizon of frozen clouds an ocean wave as tall as a skyscraper the flashing interior of a wormhole through which the principal characters fly their spacecraft. The most striking thing about these images is that were rarely encouraged to ooh and aah over them; unlike most ambitious space operas since 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) Interstellar inspires not wonder but a cool contemplation. Nolan and his brother Jonathan who cowrote the script advance a hard-science perspective incorporating such concepts as the theory of relativity and placing dramatic emphasis on research and problem solving. The movie centers on the pressing problem of how to save humanity as global warming renders the earth uninhabitable. Set in the late 21st century it imagines a future in which the worlds population has been decimated by food shortages and ecological disasters. The United States has reverted to an agricultural society to feed whats left of the population and undo the ""excesses of the 20th century."" (Typical of Hollywood sci-fi screenwriters the Nolans never stop to consider how other countries have fared.) Yet the human race is still in jeopardy because the atmosphere is becoming too polluted to breathe. The Nolans establish this situation by focusing on the daily life of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a former pilot and engineer forced by the government to operate a farm. An all-American single parent he recalls numerous Steven Spielberg protagonists--brilliant impulsive and down-to-earth. Soon after uncovering a top-secret NASA base Cooper is recruited to pilot a team of scientists (Anne Hathaway Wes Bentley and David Gyasi none of them especially credible) through space and time so they can explore distant planets that might sustain human life. Their mission must be completed as soon as possible because theyll be traveling at the speed of light and time will pass much more quickly on earth than it will for them. Oddly Interstellar rarely feels suspenseful. As in Nolans ""Dark Knight"" trilogy the storytelling falters whenever the filmmakers attempt anything more intimate than a special-effects set piece. Moreover the film seems to lack any unifying theme that might give substance to the various scientific concepts and the thin characterization (a chronic shortcoming of Nolans films) prevents one from really engaging with the material emotionally. After the first hour with its poignant depiction of humanitys decline Interstellar always seems to be rebuilding its momentum offering plenty to think about but little to hold on to.

"Interstellar - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Interstellar Posted by Christy Lemire on November 16 2014 89 Comments Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures Rated PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong language. Running time 169 minutes. Two stars out of four. Yes I recognize the egregious tardiness of this review. ""Interstellar"" has been out for over a week now. Ive started and stopped writing about it a good solid half dozen times including a three-day hiatus while I was at a ladies getaway weekend in Palm Springs with a bunch of school moms. Being functional was not on the agenda. Now its time to buckle down and dig in and Ill try to do it with both the brevity and directness Christopher Nolans film is lacking. Its a tricky thing writing about ""Interstellar."" Nolans latest provokes intense and conflicting reactions more so than any of his previous films. (And for the record Ive been a fan -- I love ""Memento"" ""Inception"" and ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" not so much as you may have heard.) Its a film I didnt exactly enjoy and cant say I would recommend. And yet as an event as a singular movie-watching opportunity its undoubtedly worthwhile. How often do you get the chance to see a film projected in 70mm IMAX? Its awesome and overwhelming but also overbearing and ultimately kind of silly. But thats only the beginning of the contradictions which are many and maddening. Nolans space odyssey features some truly striking imagery and you certainly have to appreciate that he remains a fervent champion of shooting on film. (Hoyte Van Hoytema whose previous beautiful work includes Spike Jonzes ""Her"" and the original Swedish vampire thriller ""Let the Right One in"" is the cinematographer.) Individual moments of grandeur are jaw-dropping including the sight of a spaceship passing as a tiny blip against a massive Saturn and its rings in various shades of brown and gray. But strangely other shots - including some of the exterior of the ship against a vast blackness or docking into a space station - look conspicuously like models. ""Interstellar"" boasts a strong cast filled with Oscar winners and nominees and it places them in scenarios which are sprawling in their ambitions and dizzying in their scientific complexity. But then the dialogue theyre stuck working with often inspires either dozing or unintended giggling. The script -- which Nolan wrote with his brother and frequent collaborator Jonathan Nolan -- is terrible. It alternates between dry and expository high-tech jargon and weepy overly simplistic notions of love. Nolan is not exactly known as the most emotional director -- although I appreciate the clockwork precision of his filmmaking -- but here when he tries to get a little gushy the result is just laughable. That gushiness also comes with the accompaniment of a typically insistent Hans Zimmer score (which is different from the signature WHOMMM from ""Inception"" FYI). But ""Interstellar"" also suffers from some muddled sound issues. You may find yourself straining to hear the dialogue at times -- not that youll necessarily want to hear it. Another frustrating inconsistency comes from the films pacing which alternates between draggy and relentless. It takes a long time to establish this post-apocalyptic near future a withering place where farming has replaced technology as the planets primary purpose. And then poof Matthew McConaugheys character is saying good-bye to his kids and heading into space having been asked to commandeer a dangerous mission within minutes of discovering NASAs clandestine headquarters. McConaugheys Cooper is a widowed former astronaut now living in a modest farmhouse with his inquisitive daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) his teenage son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and his circumspect father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Its a world where the powers that be are erasing the accomplishments of the past and where regular folks are struggling to survive just one more day. (The massive Steinbeckian dust storms that smother and swallow everything are a frightening sight to behold.) As is the case with most McConaughey characters Cooper gets by on his charm; ""Interstellar"" requires him to deliver many intricate lines but doesnt ask him to stray too far beyond his confident charismatic persona. His strongest moments actually come when hes playfully bantering on Earth with the spitfire Foy and earnestly promising hell come home to her. A series of mysterious signs leads Cooper and Murphy to NASAs underground operations and to some semblance of hope. As they learn from the dignified gentleman who runs the place Professor Brand (Michael Caine Nolans go-to voice of reason) a dozen brave pioneers shipped out a few years ago in search of other planets that might be habitable. They accessed these far-away lands through a wormhole near Saturn which space aliens may or may not have placed there as a gift. (Whos to say? Aliens are mysterious creatures.) Now Cooper has the opportunity to save all of humanity by hopping inside a rocket with a group of brilliant scientists -- as well as a clunky but omniscient HAL 9000-like robot named TARS voiced by Bill Irwin -- by visiting three of these planets which seem like the safest destinations. The only one of these supporting characters who gets much of a discernible personality is Brands daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway). ""Interstellar"" goes out of its way to establish her as supremely qualified for this mission -- one of the top experts in her field -- which is commendable. But eventually the film reveals that it doesnt think much of its women as it undermines both her and Jessica Chastains character who arrives much later as the grown-up version of Murphy once decades have passed on Earth. (Theres a convoluted space-time continuum issue which complicates matters.) Both women are clearly geniuses yet they make decisions based on romantic impulses which seem not just contradictory to their natures but stereotypically chickish. If I were an astronaut Id be seriously offended. Eventually there is a massive third-act twist. Im not going to ruin it (although I have a theory about whats actually going on with it). Regardless it feels like a cheat and it doesnt work. ""Interstellar"" begins life with great aspirations and originality but it ultimately devolves into a sorta-clever ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Still if youre going to see it you may as well do so on the biggest screen you can find. Unfortunately it wont stay with you for long afterward.

Reply November 16 2014  by  strashilol     You mean nonsense as in ""Ive enjoyed the movie I strongly disagree with the review and I dont think the author actually understood the film?"" If yes then by all means do count me as one of the nonsense-spewing trolls. ""HAL 9000-like robot named TARS"" - I dont think the author undestood that movie either (or the book for that matter). Can anyone name me one similarity between the two apart from the fact that theyre both AI? Reply November 20 2014  by  laguna_greg     There arent any. Reply November 21 2014  by  John     I think she may have meant to compare it to the monolith not HAL but Im not sure. Reply November 26 2014  by  trainingtofly     I also enjoyed this movie very much. Its more of an intellectual movie than most which I appreciate. I understood the plot very well and liked the characters and did not consider the women too ""chickish."" Emotion is a huge party of why we do what we do. It can make characters morereal and I think thats what it did in this movie. Interstellar is not for everybody and apparently this author did not like it. That being said-do not pass up this movie based on all the reviews. Im glad I went to see it even after reading reviews like this. For me it was very memorable- and I would see it again. Form your own opinion. I thought it was worth the time. It is definitely not what youd expect. Reply November 20 2014  by  Omotunde     I think you need to see that movie again. I agree with some of your criticisms of it especially concerning the third act sort of feeling like a cheat but considering that it is at the core of the entire plot of the film It is not so difficult to let it slide. I totally disagree with your point on the undermining of female characters in the movie. Brands emotional decision is the writers honest portrayal her character and does not speak of women as a sex. And more importantly the whole movie is bound by the theme of love and its power as an unseen force so Brands sentimentality is totally accounted for. I agree that the movie does require a certain amount of concentration to keep up with the scientific jargon but I dont at anytime recall it being boring or time wasting every conversation was meaningful and full of information. Yes it was a typical McConaughey performance but then he does it so well. Interstellar was not a perfect film but it was a very ambitious one and maybe sometimes too ambitious but in all it is a testament to originality and outstanding cinematics. Watching Interstellar like all good films leaves you with the feeling of a memorable experience. Reply November 25 2014  by  Narg     Trev stop being a troll... Reply November 16 2014  by  Allen     I consider you and Richard Roeper as the two critics whose taste hews most closely to mine and in this case of differing opinions I have to agree with Roeper who gave it an A+. It would seem my wife agrees with him too since she called it ""one of the best movies Ive ever seen."" I do agree to some extent with your criticism about Hathaways character making a decision based on romantic impulses. But to be fair she didnt actually make a decision; it was only the decision she would have made (and to be even more fair it turns out that it would have been the correct decision) and someone can be both romantic AND smart (a la me  ) No one smart would ever say that they havent made bad decisions for romantic reasons or for any reasons for that matter. Furthermore Hathaways character explicitly makes the point that Cooper would/will make the very same type of bad decision if the first decision doesnt work out. As for Chastains character Im not sure what you even mean when you say she made a decision based on romantic issues. I didnt see that happening at all. Reply November 16 2014  by  Hank S.     Also the whole love is science monologue thing was the setup for the whole ending and she was ALSO right about that. As far as genderism Id also point out that Matthews decisions were often out of love though for his daughter (not so much for the son right?) Reply November 24 2014  by  Jesse H.     Hank S. Maybe the aliens told Matthews character that his son was a demon. Reply November 16 2014  by  dman     Not to sound like ""the troll"" but I think the people who wont truly understand or appreciate the movie are those that are not fluent in the idea of space and the new theories of science that were ignored for decades after Einstein presented a theory of possibilities on many dimensions and their relation to us as we know them. This movie yes had its weak points in story line. I refer to it as filler for everyone else that isnt at the ""nerd alert convention"" it could have been. However the science was the best and easiest way to explain much of the science that has only reached the higher levels in the field. Never a fan of either of the two main characters Anne Hathaway and Mathew McConaughey I still found my self riveted to the edge of my seat once they left the ground. Just the cinematography is enough to refer it to someone else. Though as a critic you have to refer it to the masses you appeal to. Reply November 25 2014  by  Narg     No not a troll and you also bring up a big issue with many movie goers these days. Movies today try very hard to mix in reality with fiction to make the fiction more personal and/or believable. It is still fiction. So trying to say it doesnt follow this scientific fact or that physics fact or this theory is just stupid in so many ways. Like the bashing of Gravity this film is seeing a lot of negativity built on its poke at scientific study when it is anything but that. Science is just a basic vehicle for the movie to ride its background on. Nothing real nothing new and nothing to be held as any truth. Reply November 16 2014  by  Angelian     I strongly agree with Mrs. Lemires analysis.I did not read the book before seeing the movie and I was left lot of unanswered questions. There was a lot that didnt add up. Some scenes drug on and seemed insignifant. Honestly the movie was just bad. It had potential but someone dropped the ball Reply November 17 2014  by  Travis     There was no book. The movie was not based on a book. What didnt you like about it? Did you not understand it? So far Ive met a lot of people who didnt understand the science so they wrote it off as a ""stupid movie"". Reply November 17 2014  by  Rodney     Are you sure your brain was functioning when you watched the movie? Reply November 17 2014  by  Chris     ""Eventually there is a massive third-act twist. ...although I have a theory about whats actually going on with it ... Regardless it feels like a cheat and it doesnt work"" Couldnt disagree more. Its hardly a cheat. Combining your comment there with ""a wormhole near Saturn which space aliens may or may not have placed there as a gift"" also suggests that you missed some key parts of what the film is about. And you dont really need a theory. They told you what was happening in the film. I also agree with strashilols comments on your comparison between TARS and HAL. There is no connection other than them being forms of AI. So full disagreement. This film is amazing and uses science in a way that few films have ever managed to do. Brilliantly in fact. Reply November 17 2014  by  John     Couldnt agree more. Great response great movie. Reply November 24 2014  by  Brian     Its definitely a cheat in the third-act. Come on - humans built a tesseract that led to being behind the bookshelf in the past? Wouldnt it have been a heck of a lot easier just to WRITE A NOTE and tell him what to do? All this technology and advanced future civilization that can manipulate space and time but no you cant simply tell someone what to do. Thats what made no sense - I liked 3/4 of the movie but the ending went too far and was a cop out - as the author said it became a Twilight Zone movie versus an actual science fiction movie. Shame they couldnt have wrapped it up better. Reply November 28 2014  by  Ryan     Except they couldnt manipulate space and time only gravity which is why he manipulated gravity to send a message instead of writing a note. So far every criticism Ive read comes from someone who didnt really think things through. Interstellar couldnt be farther away from Twilight Zones campiness. I just dont get that comparison at all. Reply November 29 2014  by  Knopfler     That still doesnt explain the ultimate information transfer. Exactly how does one ""program"" a watchs second hand with gravity? And thats only one of the movies many failings. Cooper runs out the door upon finding coordinates in the sand but doesnt believe it when it tells him to stay? Dont get me wrong Im a huge Nolan fan especially when it comes to Memento Batman Begins and Inception. But the inconsistencies in the characters choices and actions are a serious problem. Cooper takes specific actions and makes decisions only to further the films plot logic/consistency be damned. That and the heavy reliance on emotionality ultimaley make this flick a hokey schlock-fest. Cant say I care to ever see it again. File this one under tryingtoohardtobeclever Reply December 2 2014  by  Nlucky     The watch was mechanical. Cooper was able to influence gravity (eg settling dust binary code). It is not too much of a stretch to imagine that he could use gravity to affect the movement of the mechanical parts. How exactly he laid out a repeating sequence isnt explained but I dont think it is necessary. December 2 2014  by  Ellen Catalina (daimondog)     I agree. It was a cheat and it bothered me too Reply December 2 2014  by  Sal     Like the author you must not have paid attention to the movie either. a) The singularity wasnt linked directly to the bookshelf thats just what it manifested as because its what Cooper could use to grasp the concept. He even says that while hes in there. b) You couldnt write a note or specific instructions because its on the inside of a black hole. Not even light can escape. They can however send rudimentary messages like Morse code or binary. And they did in fact tell them what to do. Cooper and TARS helped Murph solve the equation by sending the information in Morse. Reply January 2 2015  by  Cara     I really disagree with this review I loved the film and genuinely feel it is the best film Ive ever seen- it was visually stunning Zimmers score was spectacular and such a welcome change the actors were all very well cast (particularly cooper and young murph) and I thought there was an ideal mix of emotion and science it wasnt too gushy at all. I do have one question thats been bugging me though. Half of you will probably jump down my throat for asking and label me as a person who doesnt pay attention but I am a layman where physics is concerned and I did try to get it all I even went twice to see it and Im not slating the film- as I said before I adored it. My question is- How did future generations of us exist to create the tesseract in the black hole to allow cooper to manipulate gravity and communicate with himself/ murph in the past? Humans would have had to have survived without cooper and become very advanced in order to create the tesseract in the first place and allow him to save humanity... How could he (in their  past) save humans when theyve already survived and thrived? And to have survived and thrived they must have had access to the data needed from the black hole singularity to solve the problem of gravity. Hmmm... I think my head is going to explode. And the answer will be something ridiculous I cant grasp about how time is a loop or a curve or something. But if anyone could explain it to me Id really appreciate it as its bugging me Reply January 5 2015  by  Mahek     Im not sure either but I think its because time here is protrayed as a flat circle meaning that cooper left earth and ended up in the tessaract which enabled mankind to survive and then allow the future humans to create the tessaract so that cooper could use it in the past. So its not like the future humans created the tessaract to alter their past they made it to make sure that their present stayed the same. Does that make any sense? January 26 2015  by  Peter     The wormhole serves as clear proof that survival was possible without it. Murphys Law Whatever can happen will happen. In some ridiculously improbable scenario humans survived somewhere and evolved. Thats the basic summary but it gets so much more interesting from here. Your confusion comes from the misconception that these are beings of only four dimensions freely traveling back and forth through ONE timeline. Lets go back to Murphys Law. If we could survive then somewhere somehow we did. Give all conceivable scenarios of what could have happened to humans (survival or not) their own timeline. Beings of five dimensions can not only move up and down through a single timeline but can float side to side from one timeline to another. If they can exist somewhere in the space-time continuum then they can then go anywhere in space-time continuum. The brilliant words of Professor Brandt sums it up ""It just has to work once Murph."" November 17 2014  by  Lucille Hughes     Great review. How many times can you go to manual override? Answer whenever anything is about to go to absolute hell. The moral mastery of the American alpha male will bring it home against all reason and physical laws of the universe with his superior steering skills and good ol know-how. Or something. He just needs to get a feel for the thing Slick. Also his love for his grumpy daughter transcends time and space but his son? A thump on the back and the car keys. Reply November 17 2014  by  John     Please dont make a review based on whether or not you understand the movie. If you took the time to research some of the things you ridiculed you would see that they in fact make plenty of sense. Also Nolan has gone on record saying the ""sound issues"" were meant to be as they were. Reply November 17 2014  by  Joe     ....The Nolan Brothers just made M. Night Shamylans next movie (and no that is not a compliment). Ironic that the spaceship was named ""Endurance"" because thats what it took to make it through this 3 hours of nonsense. Reply November 17 2014  by  flower     The movie shows quite clearly that Brands ultimate act to base such a crucial decision on ""romantic love"" is a celebration of female wisdom that takes its root in the emotion known as ""love"". An emotion that you seem to show disregard and contempt for. As a fellow woman I am seriously offended. Reply November 26 2014  by  Egotte     Yep Brand being the only woman in the crew... her feminine gut instinct her intuition was right against the scientists/robots non-emotional theories which didnt take blatant lies into account. Reply November 17 2014  by  Bret     I cant believe people here that disagree with the review are suggesting that is her lack of scientific understanding that made her dislike the movie. Im an engineer that saw this movie with a physicist; we both thought the movie sucked. So there goes your whole ""if you understand the science youd like the movie"" rhetoric. The ironic thing as that most of you claiming to understand the science probably most likely do not. The complexity of theory involved is Ph.D level physics. Also the writer critiqued the movie for things such as dialogue audio plot-pacing and the dumbing-down of the female characters near the end (which I agree with). So those of you being little brats need to stop thinking youre as intelligence as you perceive yourself to be and dont put down others because they dont need agree with your opinion.

Couldnt agree more with the review. As a movie it was just bad. Science cant save it. Reply January 1 2015  by  Peter     I call BS on that. I know a hell of a lot about physics and astrophysics and this movie was one of the most sound representations of the ""sci"" in sci-fi to come along EVER There are of course liberties taken with things like what it will be like entering a black hole because thats something that we simply cannot know but thats where the ""fi"" comes in. Everything built around that though was very well done. I agree with some of the other commenters when they say that people who simply didnt understand the movie had the most problems with it. Theres just one comment after another with criticisms that can easily be ripped apart by someone who paid attention. For example... "" Cooper runs out the door upon finding coordinates in the sand but doesnt believe it when it tells him to stay?"" -answer he ran out the door because HE surmised they were coordinates. Hell believe his own intelligence but if your 10 year old starts telling you what SHEs interpreted from ghostly occurences would you think shes actually being smart or just using child-like creativity give her a pat on the head and say ""thats nice dear now watch your cartoons"". Theres a big difference between an adult making sense of information and a child. Its a perfectly believable difference. Again just not paying attention to whats going on.

I typically agree with her but shes way off on this one Reply November 18 2014  by  Neil     One of the worst films Ive seen in a long time. I recommend skipping this one. At the beginning the 2 of us both very intelligent well traveled deep thinking spiritual yet practical persons really liked the massive dust storms and then the feelings of soaring on an unmanned drone and then the sense of weightlessness on the space ship. Then started the muddled voice of the lead man and a story line that we just couldnt follow which got continuously more muddled as the minutes all 269 of them dragged on. About half way through I decided to just give up on trying to understand the film feeling Id never get to understand it so why bother trying. I felt it was either written by people that had smoked something really weird or had a gigantic knowledge of space science fiction and assumed that their whole audience also did. I have an appreciable understanding of quantum physics and still couldnt understand where the story was going. Im absolutely amazed that an acquaintance of mine thought it was far superior to Avatar. My recommendation is stay home and save your money. Reply November 25 2014  by  Cody     You have appreciable understanding of quantum physics but couldnt follow the simple science fiction in interstellar? They took a worm hole to look at some planets orbiting a black hole. Cooper went into said hole and was deposited in a tesseract built by future humans and fixed things in the past thus fixing the future. It was a temporal loop commonly used in scifi. Kind of a plot hole sure but the sci fi was simple. Reply November 26 2014  by  Egotte     Avatar? A massive money-grabbing success but forgettable and highly predictable. Avatar was a waste of money. Interstellar is far more complex yet far more loving and sensible than Avatar. Get with it. Reply December 5 2014  by  JediJones     Uh you claim to be a super-intelligent evolved individual yet you write that the movie is 4 hours and 29 minutes long? Clearly youre a product of some heavily downgraded educational standards. I guess they gave you academic trophies just for showing up making you think youre much smarter than you are. Reply January 1 2015  by  Peter     Honestly everything you needed to understand was explained in the characters dialogue in the film. Those that dont know about relativity and the effects of time dilation its explained. And thats pretty much all you needed to know. The parts near the end with the black hole were explained while he was in there telling you exactly what was happening. It was not a cheat. Well it was if you think that the whole time-looping thing is a cheat in itself but from a scientific perspective physicists HAVE postulated on the possibilities of space-time curving in on itself to allow the traversing of time across dimensions. If you really want to understand the film you can always read up on these topics but even if you dont like I said all you needed to understand what was going on was always explained in no more than a couple sentences of dialogue as it happened/was going to happen and if you didnt get it well Im sorry for you. Reply November 18 2014  by  Kevin K.     i mostly agree with Christys review. I enjoyed the movie but it could have been a truly great movie had it not had quite so many dumb plot elements in it. Reply November 26 2014  by  Egotte     ""Dumb plot elements""? You sound as ""dumb"" as the author of the review. A lot of folks just simply arent smart enough to get smart films like this. Its okay theres a new Penguins film out for you. Reply November 18 2014  by  Christian     Also I dont know why the critics are writing this off as ""hokey"". Im pretty shallow and I never cry in movies and I wept for ten straight minutes. So clearly the Nolan brothers did SOMETHING right. I think this is the years best movie.

Reply November 19 2014  by  Ryan     I dont think I could disagree more with this review. Its not silly its powerful. None of the ships or stations looked like models. The pacing was perfect.

Please stop reviewing movies or at least get better so people will take you seriously. Reply November 19 2014  by  Ian Michael Breske     If you think astronauts dont make decisions based on emotions I suggest you familiarize yourself with the story of Lisa Nowak.

Reply November 19 2014  by  Will     I think youre missing the boat on a lot of what happened in that movie. With all Nolan films (yes even Batman) youre going to have to view it multiple times to nail down all the angles. Hell Ive seen Inception near 50 times reviewing the script simultaneously and I still dont understand it all But you made some egregious errors here which leads me to believe you might not have been paying attention. Most heinous is that you would call Nolans script ""terrible"". The writing was on point possibly the best hes delivered to date. And the Hans Zimmer score only boosted the quality - FYI youre supposed to have to strain at times over the music (the editors wouldnt mess something like that up theres a reason for everything in his films). Anyways go see it again I think you might find yourself digging in even deeper next time. Nice try on the review but maybe get a little bit of film experience under your belt before slamming one of the best movies to hit theaters in a decade. Reply November 22 2014  by  DP     Youve seen Inception ""near 50 times""?

Youve been duped into believing the faux complexity of Nolans movies. So sad. Reply November 20 2014  by  laguna_greg     I didnt find the script gushy at all; a couple of examples on this point would have been helpful. And the score is one of the most minimal literally and stylistically that weve had in recent movies. I had no trouble hearing every word. If you dont like Dylan Thomas thats fine. I didnt find it heavy-handed or trite though. And frankly Id pay good money to hear any of those actors recite the phone book out loud let alone good poetry. Or do you just not like poetry? At all? Is that the gushy part youre complaining about? I take it the reviewer never wanted to visit space even as a child and finds the whole subject a bore? That comes through loud and clear. Go watch ""Tammy"" then and dont review movies like this again. Reply November 20 2014  by  Aisling     I agree with your review and it has nothing to do with not understanding the space / time travel aspect. The story like had serious holes in it and there was zero character development for such a long movie. I mean there were some great moments in it and the effects were amazing but the basic story was poor as far as I was concerned. Reply November 20 2014  by  laguna_greg     I missed another point ""Both women are clearly geniuses yet they make decisions based on romantic impulses which seem not just contradictory to their natures but stereotypically chickish. If I were an astronaut Id be seriously offended."" Did you fall asleep during the show? Or do you not want to admit that men are ruled by feelings too? You conveniently skipped over the part where Matt Damons character commits murder and threatens the entire mission because hes a weakling and a coward who has developed strong sociopathic tendencies. Michael Caine the driving force behind the entire mission and possibly the greatest mind on the show lies about a crucial piece of data deceiving everyone about the missions goals and even his own daughter for decades. Matthew McConaugheys choices are severely clouded by his guilt love for his children fear for their survival and his own personal call to duty and ethics. Nobody escapes their own flaws here. Every character especially the men are all driven exclusively by their own subjective feelings and desires not just the women. This is one of the central conflicts of the movie but you missed it. The subject of love which annoys you so much is just one of the emotional colors presented here. There is no ""chick"" think going on here. If you think there is you shouldnt be reviewing movies because that chip on your shoulder really gets in the way. Reply November 20 2014  by  ssjfilmking     I agree this is a difficult film to review. I need to see it again to be completely sure but I thought the characters and plot were fine. Structurally the films pacing is out of whack I mean the first 30 minutes kind of felt unnecessary for chunks. And then all of a sudden they were in space. I thought the love stuff was a bit weird sure. But it worked. It led to what I thought was an amazing climax that delivered emotion and a truckload of information. The only trouble I have with it was why did Cooper plunge into the black hole? He said it was a weight thing so why didnt he stay with Amelia and plunge the empty ship? Did he have to be in the ship to plunge it? I also didnt quite get the motivation of Dr Manns character. Overall I think the plot and characters have been unfairly treated in these film reviews. I thought the movie came together nicely but as an editor there are scenes that needed to be cut. It felt like the directors cut of a great movie where he doesnt want to cut some scenes that may have taken days to shoot. But the film was thought provoking emotional and visually outstanding. I will give it 88/100 Reply November 21 2014  by  Andrew     Have to agree with your analysis gave it a 5/10 my wife a 4/10 - characters were a little unidimensional and unbelievable in a way - if it were about a group of 12 year olds it would be much more believable as they all lacked a little maturity - I have a degree in Physics and the Science jumped from okay to barely believable not sure how you create a giant wave in two inches of water - its not that hard to write good SciFi which is why its hard to believe so much money is spent on poor scripts - thought some of his other movies were much better - compare Intetstellar to a super tight movie like Moon - oh well at least Guardians of the Galaxy was a bit of fun Reply November 25 2014  by  Cody     The planet was orbiting a black hole massive tidal forces would cause those waves. Also the fact that the waves were so big (contained a huge volume of water) could explain why water covering the planet was only a few feet deep. Id say thats fairly believable science fiction... Reply January 1 2015  by  Peter     Also the gravity of the planet itself was only 80% of Earth gravity meaning all things being equal (and theyre not with the nearby black hole) the waves could get higher than anything on Earth. Again... not paying attention Reply April 8 2015  by  james     I dont mean to be trite but of all the great representations of science in this movie (which i loved btw) it did have some flaws. The wave planet being possibly the most egregious. Here is why- yes a planet in close orbit around a black hole could have massive tidal waves however they simply would not look or behave the way they did. The shallow portions would be in constant motion as the extreme tides would generate raging currents all over the planet. The water even though only two feet deep would be moving at hundreds or thousands of mph making any attempt to land (let alone get out and trudge around) impossible. Anybody with even a cursory science background let out an audible groan as soon as they decided to even consider visiting a planet in that deep of a gravity well. Conditions on any planet close enough to a black hole to experience significant time dilation would be hellish. Btw The gases that made up wave planets atmosphere are significantly lighter than water and so would be privy to the same tidal forces meaning that those waves should have been accompanied by winds strong enough to literally disintegrate anybody on the surface in seconds. This all leads to another point the massive amounts of energy created through tidal friction would easily generate enough heat that the concept of liquid water existing there is just silly. More likely the entire surface would be a hellish windy undulating mass of fast flowing molten rock tidal waves. No serious scientist with limited resources would even consider wasting fuel on a trek to such a place. I loved the movie but i must admit i hated that scene especially as it directly followed the amazing wormhole scene which completely knocked my socks off in terms of both accuracy and vision. Reply November 21 2014  by  Hlynur     I just saw Interstellar and it is one of the best movies ive ever seen Reply November 21 2014  by  Cobra6     ""Gravity"" meets ""Inception"" meets ""Apollo 13"" meets ""Star Wars"" meets ""Alice in Wonderland"". It had a great overall story but too much detail too complicate too much astrophysics hocus pocus; would have been better with a simpler story line and more settings the audience could identify with - a few ranch houses in the corn fields not some Psycho kind of house that looked like it was furnished in the 1930s and other settings that looked like something from a bad dream. It had the makings of a very good film but definitely overkill. Oh and being sentimental (and a realist) I would have found it very satisfying if we could have seen Cooper reunite with Brand - hold each other and face kiss - SOME real joy and connection after all the gloom and sadness. Finally it would have been easier to hear if Mcconaughey hadnt whispered 90% of his lines. Hes a very believable actor but man get those words out Reply November 22 2014  by  DP     The reviewer wrote her OPINION and nothing more. Yet many are chastising her for being ""dumb"" and ""subjective""; and most of that heavy handedness is coming from self-proclaimed intellectuals who apparently got the movie. The saddest part of the whole is for anyone to even pretend that they fully understood the flick. Shows how far egos can eclipse common sense and how hopelessly scientifically religious many have become. Reply November 24 2014  by  reality     It is wrong to chastise her for being dumb and subjective but it is also wrong to infer that people did not fully understand the flick some people are indeed knowledgeable about higher dimensional realities and a lot of the metaphysical concepts presented you know. Reply November 25 2014  by  Jason     So because you didnt fully understand the movie in your obvious insecurity you need to proclaim that anybody who did fully understand it is a ""pretender"" with ""ego"" issues... I really do hope you see the irony in that statement. I did fully understand the movie and can say I thought it was a bust Nolans worst (which is still better than some directors best). Script/dialog was shallow and it sucked period. The movie has some very cool ""WOW"" moments and a few twists that are amusing but short of that anyone with any kind of attention span could see the third act twist coming about an hour before its revealed. Not Nolans best work for sure but a fun ride. A rental not a purchase. Reply November 22 2014  by  Magnameno     This movie is caught between legitimate criticism and illegitimate. Unfortunately the legitimate gives credibility to the illigitimate. Reply November 26 2014  by  Francis J Morris     Good review and well put. Though I think that the author s review is convoluted by her own stereotypes and misses the underlying message. Anne Hathaway motivated by love is ""chickish"" well then Cooper was equally chickish by being motivated to see his children again and matt Damon was chickish for desiring companionship most people that Ive spoken with that disliked the movie have the common issue with the science and the intellectual depth it has this is not your average go to space and encounter big green aliens movies the author found the jumping between science jargon and emotion troublesome I couldnt disagree more Nolan blended the two beautifully its not a movie for the objective thinker and the mix of science fiction and pure humanity makes this movie excellent you just have to allow yourself to see the subliminal implications and i believe this movie will appeal to you Reply November 26 2014  by  Egotte     It seems like you were too busy at the time of writing the review to really care much about the film. I think you should consider rewatching the film and rewriting the review. As of now your take on Interstellar simply makes you appear to have a lower EQ than other film-goers such as myself. Reply November 26 2014  by  Richard     Christy I highly suggest you see this movie again. I couldnt disagree more on most of what you said. I feel you lacked the intellect to truly appreciate what this movie is all about. A thought provoking thriller with twists and turns all along the way I would recommend this movie to anybody who is smart enough to actually appreciate what Nolan has beautifully crafted. Reply November 28 2014  by  Valerie     Christopher Nolan is one of the only few directors who can make a movie so deep so cinematically moving and one that will let a movie-goer walk out of the cinema and recommend to others to go see it. Christy the reason your profession is dying (i.e web blogs vs. AP/USA TODAY - they laid off Scott Bowles - and an array of others) is because the movie going experience is becoming less relevant and as the streaming generation comes up they will watch movies on a 16 inch tablet and be satisfied. With that said I would think that while you might not like this movie you might realize your voice in the this dying circle enough to recognize this is an event film. Reply November 29 2014  by  Chris     Your review like the film is filled with non sequiturs that make it drag out way past expiration date. Your first paragraph; seriously? Who cares? Reply November 29 2014  by  fritz     This movie is so much more than a sci/fi story. The main story is the father daughter bond; the music was written around that as Hans Zimmer explained in an interview; the main music theme of the movie is a love letter of Hans Zimmer to his son. And Matt Mc Conaughey plays that part of the father daughter relationship brilliantly. I agree the science facts are too complicated for a layman; as i said the movie is so much more than a Sci Fi movie; is it about the inevitable leaving behind your kids as a parent; Hans Zimmer is a genius. Reply December 2 2014  by  Ellen Catalina (daimondog)     Can I add that I found it most bothersome when Hathaways character falls down during a frantic ""hurry up doom is coming"" scene and has to be carried back to the ship. Can we bury that old Hollywood trope that women under pressure invariably fall down and need to be carried to safety? Reply December 2 2014  by  Ellen Catalina (daimondog)     I agree with your assessment of this film. Reply December 2 2014  by  socalsteve     Lemire you really did not understand this movie. Were you texting your friends the while time while watching or what? Horrible review. Reply December 7 2014  by  pat     TERRIBLE REVIEW Did you even watch the movie? Reply December 9 2014  by  Ann     You know I do agree that the female characters seemed undermined doctor Brand anyway. I remember watching and thinking ""Okay wow they would make the woman insist on going to a planet because she is driven by love."" She had more reasons than that and she ended up being right but what came to mind is that it would negatively reinforce those sexist comments ""Never let a woman have a position of power because theyre just too emotional to think rationally."" It probably wont but I agree with the authors review of this movie. Reply December 9 2014  by  tony     I agree with this review especially how they made dr. brand into a stereotype. The other two characters on the space ship got zero development. Overall it ran a little too long. You either buy into the maudlin sentimentality or not but they pushed it a little too hard for me. I can see why some would like it though. Reply December 10 2014  by  yourmom     Its a shame that most people are too small-minded to understand this movie which is quite possibly the best-researched blockbuster - and maybe even movie period - ever made. The attention to detail and scientific accuracy is extraordinary and the questions it ponders are on the cutting edge of theoretical physics. Yes a lot of it is fiction and yes some of it gets a little loopy (love is a dimension? really?) but a lot of the problems the characters face are real problems the human race would encounter should we ever evolve to that point. There are a few scientific inaccuracies that are forgivable (Cooper mentioning traveling near the speed of light for example) and Cooper communicating with his daughter via gravity in the tesseract is pure fantasy. But its fantasy that explores possibilities relating to one of the most profound open questions in physics today - how gravity fits in with the other three fundamental forces. Combine this intellectual depth with stunning imagery plausible character behavior and a compelling emotional narrative and you have what might be the best movie made in decades. Shame most people are too dumb to pick up on it. Reply December 12 2014  by  Rupam Shyamal     Absolutely agreed with you yourmom.. Im an Engineer and I have huge interests for physics and to be honest at some part of the film I doubted ""is it scientifically possible?"" (Im quite familiar with all the scientific aspects shown in this movie) so I bought the book ""Science of Interstellar"" by Kip Thorne and I have to admit I was blown away to find that 95% of the film is actually based on proper science and educated guesses. And for all those people criticizing this film I highly recommend to read couple of books on Relativity and Black Holes and the book I mentioned above (But a thorough knowledge of science is highly required to fully understand that book) my suggestion is ""Dont underestimate a film if you cant understand itor YOU think THATs not possible.... better do some research and then comment"" and finally its a ""Film"" not a science documentary so Its better to praise the scientific aspect and enjoy the true masterpiece named ""Interstellar"" Reply January 1 2015  by  Peter     This is perhaps the smartest comment regarding this movies science. Bravo The whole notion of gravity fitting in with the other forces and figuring out the quantum relation is at the heart of unifying everything we know about physics and its here that the film makes a conjecture as Cooper enters the black hole the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. (or who know maybe its coincidentally right?)  A brilliant movie that blends real science theoretical exposition and emotion all into one story. Reply December 15 2014  by  David     I think some of the gripes you have are valid like the quick way the main character decides to leave or some of the female characters decisions BUT you have to give credit where credit is due both females who made decisions based on ""hunches"" or ""sentiments"" turned out to be correct kind of validating their 6th sense... The other gripes about feeling cheated by the final chapter of the movie thats mostly due because you dont seem to have a good grip with the science behind it. The end was amazeballs The best part? Its all mathematically possible. A virtual representation in 3 dimensions of the 4th dimension A.K.A. Tesseract build by our descendants who now live in the 5th dimension is technically possible and the visual representation of it is pretty freaking good Reply December 30 2014  by  R     Ultimately the female characters had non-sentimental reasons backing up their decisions along with their feelings (same as male characters) so I wouldnt say the film was honoring the female intuition or blah blah blah Reply December 30 2014  by  R     gt;But eventually the film reveals that it doesnt think much of its women as it undermines both her and Jessica Chastains character... Both women are clearly geniuses yet they make decisions based on romantic impulses which seem not just contradictory to their natures but stereotypically chickish Well even with Dr. Brand having a romantic entanglement it is implied that she was not lying about his planet still being the better one. But it is reasonable that Cooper was suspicious about her leanings after learning about her attachment to the guy. As for Murphy I didnt find her to be stereotypical except for maybe holding a grudge against her dad as she grew up. Reply January 4 2015  by  reen     This movie was much too long it didnt keep my attention and I watched the clock for the majority of the second half. I dont know why I didnt like it. Ann H. was dry. Matthew M. just ditched his family to head up this weirdly random mission. The whole Im going to save the world crap was campy at best. Reply January 12 2015  by  Chris Winters     I think you may have misunderstood some of the plot twists. While there are a FEW contradictions the story is actually mesmerizing and beautiful when fully understood. As for the female protagonists making decisions based on ""romantic impulses"" this is just not the case unless you consider a woman wanting to finish the lifelong works of their father and the decisions made ounce a paternal trust between father and daughter is broken undermining... I would also hardly call that a romantic decision considering the relationship between father and daughter is not only not romantic but also a very special connection which cannot be matched nor could you blame them for the decisions made based on the plot twists. You are entitled to your opinion of course but I definitely think you have misunderstood the plot of the movie and you yourself have undermined the Beauty in this film i enjoyed it immensely but I also immensely enjoyed one of the most critically acclaimed television series of all time The Twilight Zone. But thats my opinion. Reply Pingback Interstellar-Mankind was born on Earth.

McConaughey has now returned for director Christopher Nolans sci-fi opus Interstellar and over the intervening months the concept of time has only become more perplexing--one dimension out of at least five that make an appearance in the movie. Indeed a modicum of perplexity may be the price of admission Though Interstellar is quick to cite Einsteins theories of relativity--celebrated theoretical physicist Kip Thorne acted as a consultant and executive producer--it rarely slows down to explain how they apply.In any case Interstellar is quite adamant--and here Im certain the movie is not channeling Einstein--that however many dimensions may exist love trumps them all. Love we are instructed variously is ""quantifiable"" ""must have a purpose"" and ""is the one thing that transcends time and space.""If this sounds like a hokey premise for a story about Earthly apocalypse and intergalactic exodus thats because it is one. But this is hokiness of uncommon scale and grandeur. Interstellar may be a preposterous epic but it is an epic nonetheless. For years the project was attached to Steven Spielberg and these roots are very much in evidence. Envision a movie as Spielberg-y as any youve ever seen--all the craftsmanship all the sentimentality--add in a concluding twist reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan (not the current version but the circa-Signs not-yet-tragic version) and youll have a pretty good sense of what to expect.Related Story Interstellar The New 2001? The movie opens with a series of elderly commentators recollecting their youth in a rural America smothered by dust dust covering bookshelves dust choking crops dust accumulating so insistently that you had to put the plates facedown when setting the table. Steinbecks Dustbowl? No a stray laptop soon alerts us that this is a Dustbowl yet to come. The exact cause of the environmental catastrophe is never clarified though it is clearly something we brought upon ourselves. The threat moreover is existential The Earth is slowly suffocating itself. The last wheat harvests are long gone and the last okra harvest is around the corner--though according to taste one might consider this a feature rather than a bug. Corn remains but how long can it sprout from land so doomed?Among the farmers tilling this egregious soil is a former NASA pilot named Cooper (McConaughey) single father to a down-to-Earth son and a head-in-the-clouds daughter. The latter Murph (named after Murphys Law and played in her youth by Mackenzie Foy) believes that a poltergeist is haunting the overstuffed bookshelf in her bedroom and in her mystico-scientific way sets out to prove it. She also gets in trouble for bringing an old textbook to school one that has not been ""corrected"" to explain that the 20th-century Apollo missions were merely a hoax to bankrupt the Soviets. Burned once by science the nation as a whole has turned inward backward.But not so Cooper. ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars"" he lectures his father-in-law (played with curmudgeonly nonchalance by John Lithgow). ""Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" Fortunately for Cooper he is not alone in this view. The NASA for which he once flew long believed shuttered has in fact gone underground as exactly the kind of covert government outfit that Fox Mulder was always looking for. Moreover it just happens to be in need of a top-notch pilot to complete its ongoing secret mission of extraterrestrial exploration and colonization.As luck would have it the fellow running the show turns out to be an old teacher of Coopers Professor Brand (Michael Caine) who explains that decades earlier an intergalactic wormhole was created near Saturn by mysterious five-dimensional beings who evidently wanted to help humankind find a new home. Initial manned probes were sent to several planets on the far side and the plan is for Cooper to fly a larger ship called the Endurance--a ring-shaped vessel reminiscent of the space station in 2001 A Space Odyssey--through the wormhole to determine which of those worlds might prove fittest for human habitation.Accompanying him will be three other human crewmembers one of whom is Professor Brands daughter (Anne Hathaway) and two of whom are not (David Gyasi and Wes Bentley). Also along for the ride will be two robots that seem to have wandered in from another movie altogether wisecracking aluminum boxes that amble like Gumby and gleam like high-end kitchenware. Cooper of course accepts the mission--""This world was never enough for you Coop"" his father-in-law grouses--even though it pains him cruelly to leave his kids especially the heartbroken Murph who refuses to see him off.I wont say much about what unfolds once theyre aloft. But the novel obstacle that Cooper and his fellows must overcome as I hinted earlier is time itself. Its not merely that the clock is running out for life on Earth its that due to a property called gravitational time dilation (predicted by Einstein and since confirmed experimentally) the clock is running far more quickly back home than it is for the astronauts. When the latter land on a planet orbiting a black hole for instance a single precious hour on the surface is equal to seven years time on Earth. Before leaving his daughter Cooper had joked that when they met again they might be the same age--and indeed soon enough they are with Jessica Chastain inheriting the role of the grownup Murph.Interstellar may be a preposterous epic but it is an epic nonetheless.McConaughey is entirely solid as the conflicted dad-turned-space-jockey and Caine could pull off the avuncular authority of the elder Dr. Brand in his sleep. Hathaway however is an awkward fit as Dr. Brand fille too loose at times and too tight at others. Shes certainly not helped by plot developments that quickly render her the Girl Who Needs Rescuing and later have her argue for making decisions about the survival of the human race based on whom she wants to canoodle with. Yes the movie itself may ultimately come to the conclusion that love conquers all but making Hathaway an early advocate for this thesis does not exactly bolster her scientific credentials. There is much agonized familial melodrama on display throughout a father (McConaughey) whos left his daughter behind on Earth; a daughter (Hathaway) whos done the same with her dad. Difficult choices are made with regularity and there is much discussion of our obligations to our children to ourselves and to humankind as a whole. Lest there be any doubt of how seriously the film treats these questions they are often accompanied by deafening swells of the Hans Zimmer score and repeated invocations--I counted at least four--of the Dylan Thomas poem ""Do not go gentle into that good night."" (Its less tedious if you close your eyes and imagine that its Rodney Dangerfield doing the reciting.)This solemnity of tone coexists uncomfortably with a number of plot twists that defy any but the most generous credulity. To cite just one it turns out that the answers to the riddle that might save humanity (the ""solution"" to gravity) are to be found both in the childhood bedroom in which Murph once detected a poltergeist and in the core of a black hole galaxies away two unlikely locales that are in fact--well Ill let you see for yourself.Because despite its shortcomings Interstellar is a movie worth seeing. Yes it may be tendentious at times and absurd at others. But the scope and ambition of Nolans vision are refreshing in this era of safe bets of sequels and spinoffs and franchise-hopefuls. The visuals alone are worth it the violent whirling of a dust-hurricane on Earth; the crash of a mile-high tidal wave on a distant world; the quiet deep-space beauty of a black hole ringed by a glowing accretion disc. In ways both good and (occasionally) bad Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie. Enjoy it accordingly.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

"The Fault in Our Stars The Empty Wonder of Christopher Nolans Interstellar and the Overwrought The Theory of Everything << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com The Fault in Our Stars The Empty Wonder of Christopher Nolans Interstellar and the Overwrought The Theory of Everything Paramount Pictures Movies November 7 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print With any work of science fiction youre waiting for the big reveal -- The Revelation the thing that says This is why youve been sitting here this is why you spent all of that money. THIS By the time Christopher Nolan gets to that moment hes already contorted the plot enough times to deliver on a promise of entertainment. Weve seen Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway put on space suits and fling themselves across the universe; weve experienced a new maybe more accurate representation of wormholes. There are robot sidekicks with settings for humor and discretion that look like a brainteaser had a baby with the Monolith from 2001; theres the appearance of an unbilled movie star who injects some real poignancy and suspense. More Interstellar The Fault in Our Stars The Empty Wonder of Christopher Nolans Interstellar and the Overwrought The Theory of Everything Brothers in BRONG How Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan Make the Boldest Scores in Hollywood Should You See Interstellar? A Curious Consumers Decision-Making Guide Floating in a Most Familiar Way 21 Notes About Sci-Fi After 2001 A Space Odyssey We Went There Tunneling Through the Hype of the Interstellar Oculus Rift Experience Interstellar asks -- in all seriousness -- Are we there yet? And what does ""there"" even mean? Once this movie got to where it was going (that takes about two and a half hours) I had an involuntary spasm of laughter. What else could I do? Partly I laughed at the cleverness of the revelation. The sequence delivers. And partly I laughed because Nolan believes cleverness is the same thing as audacity. He thinks that the click of realization is profound that its the key -- when really its just the gears of a giant machine locking into place. All of this effort all of these questions all of this movie and for what? There is no there there. Nolan might like to think that with Memento The Prestige Inception and now Interstellar hes exploring important existential questions (and frequently writing with his brother Jonathan he actually is) but theres always the sense that the person making these movies has no sense of thematic proportionality. The ""about"" is out of whack with the ""what."" These movies are about Loss. Theyre about Love. Theyre also spiritually generic. They require a lot of production just to make ""change"" rhyme with ""rearrange."" With Interstellar you know youre in for it when in the opening scenes its clear the movie is about Family -- the mythic farm family the stuff of paintings and WPA photographs. Not America per se but Americana. The Nolans plant some actual characters onto that landscape but its too arid for anything interesting to grow. McConaughey plays Joseph ""Coop"" Cooper a widowed engineer whose ace piloting skills are as vestigial as this movies Field of Dreams version of baseball now appears to be. The government of the agrarian state needs him to farm corn which he does with his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and two kids 10-year-old Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and teenage Tom (Timothee Chalamet). The planet is down to its last drops. Crackpots are teaching junk history in the schools. Children are being told they can only become farmers. And the air is increasingly rich with gas that will soon cause everyone to suffocate. Interspersed amid the early action are documentary clips featuring older folks (including one played by Ellen Burstyn) who recall years of blight and one particularly cataclysmic dust storm. Theyre like interviews from a Ken Burns film playing in a gallery at some historical museum. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage The story begins well after whatever environmental catastrophe wiped out much of mankind but just in time for the last okra harvest. Now the only thing left to grow is corn suggesting that Nolan has either a great sense of self-deprecating irony or none. Murph believes ghosts haunt their farmhouse. How else to explain the books that leap from the shelf in her bedroom to the floor? Coop tells Murph to turn to science to explain the ghosts. Perhaps the ghosts were what inspired him to hop into his pickup truck drive to the middle of nowhere and stumble upon the secret headquarters of NASA which because agriculture has trumped aeronautics functions as an immense underground laboratory. That happens to be where scientists including a professor named Brand (Michael Caine) have been working for years to find earthlings a new home on a distant planet. A handful of manned probes have been sent up for exploration. One system is showing potential and Coop is asked to pilot a confirmation mission (on a ship called Endurance) that includes Brands daughter Amelia (Hathaway) an astrophysicist (David Gyasi) a geographer (Wes Bentley) and that pair of robots the talkier of which is voiced drolly by Bill Irwin. The rub of the mission is the matter of relativity. What hours are to the Endurance crew are years back on Earth. The longer they take to get answers the older their loved ones will get. Sadly until Foy ages into Jessica Chastain you dont care to spend much time at NASA and even then youre just waiting for Nolan to get to the good stuff. As Endurance powers through wormholes and enters inhospitable environments the director gets to dazzle just as he did with all of the larcenous burrowing in Inception. That movie went down. Interstellar goes out. What Nolan lacks in intellectual and emotional depth he makes up for in pliable vastness. (He does more refolding than a stock girl at the Gap.) But at his best he makes you believe that the worlds hes inventing have no end and that time and space truly are as manipulable as he claims.  Nolans cosmic wonder is tethered to so much hoariness. No one does anything in one time frame that doesnt eventually bear upon another moment. Everyone speaks in portents with nostalgia and lament. Lithgows character remembers when mankind was trying to create and invent. ""We were doers"" he says ""not caretakers."" When Murph complains to Coop that the kids at school teasingly assume she was named after Murphys Law he has to explain what that is. The best interactions in the movie occur much later when theres more at stake and Chastain and Hathaway get something to play. Wounded anger might be to Chastain what melisma is to Mariah Carey home. In the thick of the mission Coop and Amelia are surprised by a practical dilemma -- the Endurance has the capacity for only one more wormhole jaunt and has to choose between two destinations. Amelia has a personal reason for preferring one. The other is a more random crapshoot. They argue over whether her emotional reasoning makes less sense than his pragmatism. The scene gives Hathaway an opportunity for her eyes to go glassy and for her goosey manner to sour. Everything imposing about her comes from the narrowing of those eyes. Theyre like phases of the moon. McConaugheys return to space is his first since nearly denying Jodie Foster the opportunity in Contact. He coasts on his cowboy guile here. Hes almost too charismatic for this kind of heartland dystopia but he modulates effectively. If only Nolan knew how to build a movie up with emotion that didnt come exclusively from good acting. The farther out Interstellar goes the more bound to tired feelings it becomes. Fear of never again seeing a parent or a child should get to you more than it does here. But it feels as if father-daughter bonds were the best they could do. Its conceptual and taken for granted rather than explored. The Americana is meant as a kind of shorthand. Coop and Murphs bond across time isnt meant to move; its supposed to represent all such bonds. Nolan is a pop director but a limited one. For him a powerful image doesnt exactly involve people and emotion; rather its about figures in motion. With something like Inception or the last two installments of his Dark Knight trilogy that power can get to you even if some of its ultimately senseless. But here the movie is too notional to be affecting. The most touching thing that occurs involves a character putting his arms around another. Its unexpected -- for him the other characters and us. Its the one time the film opens into the sort of harrowing existential place that Alfonso Cuaron sustained for all of Gravity. Interstellar doesnt fully recover from it and that passage goes off the rails because Nolan feels like he has to give himself an action sequence. But why? For a visionary hes surprisingly cautious and some of that caution makes him seem naive. Take all the talk of love in Interstellar -- as a feeling as inspiration as a physical property. The Swiss Army knife treatment dulls the movies scientific cutting edge. Love is what makes us human. Its also what makes a Subaru a Subaru.  Great outer-space science fiction confronts you with the vastness of a void. It doesnt have any answers because there are none. Something like Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey operated in discrete movements. I watch it at least once a year hoping to get closer to a true understanding. But meaning in any strict sense is tantalizingly elusive. Kubrick was dreaming and thats the dream other directors often seem helpless trying to reproduce. So many movies want to evoke Kubricks but its dispiriting that so few feel free to go as far as he did. Its not just the light show. Its his insistence on creepiness and human smallness and angst. You can go anywhere in the movies. So Kubrick did. The original iterations of Star Wars and Star Trek took up the boundless cause of the space odyssey. Steven Spielbergs Close Encounters of the Third Kind from 1977 brought outer space to Earth but only to present a fathers sugar-free abandonment of his family in order to hang out with aliens as an act of follow-your-bliss heroism. It remains the most movingly obnoxious completely sincere ending Ive ever seen in a Hollywood movie. What a crazy way to send home an audience. But Spielberg earned that ending. That film was about religious calling and the confirmation of faith. Theres that great moment up at the mountain lab where the scientists play for the spaceships the five-tone electronic micro-symphony and theres a cut to Melinda Dillon up in the rocks singing along in frustrated rapture. ""I know that"" she says through tears all the work and faith and presumed insanity paying off. You get emotional with her. Spielberg is a wide-shot director. His power as an emotionalist arrives at the moment when it all clicks for everybody when the personal becomes popular when belief upends doubt in public when many become one. Nolan doesnt have Spielbergs skill with framing. But when Nolan is on he can make the popular private the immense intimate. Hes also more convincing when circumstances are grim. The Dark Knights nihilism was the most comprehensively persuasive atmosphere hes conjured. He bore into some of those characters even while building a wider urban world. The atmosphere was viral. When district attorney Harvey Dent becomes the villain Two-Face its past the films halfway point. Dents girlfriend has just been blown up. He makes an arguably rational embrace of the movies bleakness. That films characters felt like a breakthrough for Nolan whos a better puzzle-maker than a pure storyteller. What makes you laugh about him when some of his non-Batman films reach their climax is his apparent belief that the puzzle is doing more work than it is. For me the mere ingenuity of the puzzle is enough. But its not for him. Hes got to build for his movies the soul that other films are born with. In Interstellar Nolan pours on and misconstrues Dylan Thomass ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" refurbishes warped dreamscapes from Inception and ends the film three times. The images photographed in 70mm Imax by Hoyte Van Hoytema are as gorgeous as youd expect. (The many non-Imax shots look sludgy at that scale.) But the incongruity becomes funny. He doesnt realize these people just arent as cool or compelling as outer space. While youre sitting there with McConaughey hovering in a mild panic (this man does not freak out) and Nolans grand machine of a movie has just clicked into place it occurs to you that for all the relativity and eternity Interstellar itself is small. It gives you everything you want in a vision of the future everything except awe.  Liam Daniel/Focus Features ""There should be no boundary to the human endeavor"" were told at some point in The Theory of Everything. But how would this movie know? There are enough boundaries in it to induce claustrophobia. The mind of the cosmologist Stephen Hawking would seem to be its own kind of deep space but who needs that when youve got access to his heart? This movie is even more comfortable with the familiar than Nolans. Its based on the memoir Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) wrote about her marriage to Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). In the film they meet at a University of Cambridge party in 1963. While ""Heat Wave"" is playing he sees her across the room. They dont dance. But talking on the stairs they do make a connection that leaves him infatuated. Later when he sees her at a pub shes seated next to a boy. Thats more a minor obstacle than a red flag. Hes the one who pulls away as Lou Gehrigs disease begins to hijack his body. First hes unable to operate clothespins. Then hes walking with two canes like a sort of upright crustacean. Eventually hes left in a palsied rictus that requires a wheelchair. After his diagnosis Jane has to chase him around campus to profess her love. Hes been told that hes got only two years to live and says he needs to get to work. But the disease seems to make her want him all the more. Cue the elevator music set to a wedding/baby-at-home montage. (The movie gets a kick out of Hawkings working genitals.) The marriage itself is a triumph of patience and admiration but it isnt easy. The film quietly shifts its focus to Jane whose academic career stalls while his soars. The children keep coming. Stephen frolics with them while Jane sits at the kitchen table with an open book forlorn. ""Join the church choir"" says her mother (Emily Watson). ""Thats possibly the most English thing anyone has ever said"" Jane replies. But of course in the next scene she drops by a church and makes inquiries to a cute young organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox) who becomes both her lover and a member of the family volunteering with Stephens blessing to help with Hawkings care. Director James Marsh (Man on Wire) and screenwriter Anthony McCarten are content to make a melodrama. While Jane and Jonathan consummate their affair on a camping trip Stephen is in Bordeaux at a Wagner opera. Obviously while they make love Stephen falls ill and the cameras cutting confers a kind of guilt upon the affair producing possibly the most English juxtaposition anyone has ever attempted. As the lovers drive away from the campsite theres a cut to the taillights of the car in front of them filling the screen with red. No you stop From there on out its nothing but tedious decorum -- Graham Greene without the fervor or shame. These are good people behaving altruistically. The peals of laughter from Stephens new assistant Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) arouse Janes envy but only because you sense that she feels shes failed to continue delighting her husband. (Mason would become Hawkings second wife in 1995.) Conversations about religion relativity and quantum mechanics rarely leave the dinner table. (""String theory"" refers mostly to Johann Johannssons swollen score.) The accolades just magically pile up for Stephen (along with some unusually good middle-age makeup for both Hawkings). Marsh furnishes some nice touches. Jane gives Stephen her phone number and he stares at the digits as if theyre an equation to solve. Some of the flourishes are distractingly precious. Theres a shot in a staircase thats made to resemble geometrys golden spiral; Stephens interest in the reversal of time inspires the movie to play itself backward at the end. And Jones is nearly always in green or framed near it. She doesnt have much to act. Virtue and guilt arent the most vivid qualities and she doesnt get to perform any variations on them. Half the time shes playing a negligible consecration. Its like watching a talking postage stamp. What Redmayne does is impressive. Hes not worried about being understood. When he speaks his head is thrown back and his mouth up like a drowning person immersed to his lips in water. Thats how he sounds too. He resembles the young Hawking and is made to resemble the old. (The real Hawking is 72.) But Redmayne isnt doing My Left Brain; the movie doesnt ask for Hawkings prickliness or idiosyncrasy just his purity. To that end Redmayne also looks like Julie Andrews and Hilary Swank and thats what he gives off saintliness. The postage stamp married a pane of stained glass. This all creates a drama that feels good thats moving. But it seems ancillary to Hawkings genius which has gotten fuller riskier tributes from Errol Morris The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory all featuring the man himself. Morriss 80-minute 1991 documentary -- which shares a title with Hawkings most famous book A Brief History of Time -- dares to find a visual equivalent for Hawkings ideas to connect that thinking to Hawkings life. There are no limits for Morris. The Theory of Everything has wedged that life into such a formula -- the wearisome origin story -- that ultimately it doesnt taste like anything. There might be some value in a depiction of this iconic mans life as human -- that he can have sex and ask for a divorce. But this is a man who when inaccurately told he has two years to live asks ""What about my brain?"" Here? Its pickled.

Entertainment Inc.) ""Interstellar"" is M. Night Shyamalans finest film. It blends the aching yearning Hallmark-flavored sentimentality the melodramatic plot twists and the pseudo-profound philosophical reversals with some surprising nuggets of cutting-edge hard science and a view of the human future grounded in both realism and hope. It hits all the notes a Shyamalan fan could hope for Its about an all-American farm family in the Corn Belt struggling through hard times its about a grand intergalactic adventure whose real subject is family and love and its got numerous scenes of major movie stars trying to hold back the tears but not succeeding. Anne Hathaway sobs Jessica Chastain sobs and Matthew McConaughey sobs. Hell Matt Damon sobs buckets - and the fact that hes even in this movie was a well-protected secret until the reviews started to hit. Those people do their crying at different and irreconcilable points on the space-time continuum; now we know how water got from place to place in the universe.Yeah I know I dragged out that gag a bit too long and Shyamalan had nothing to do with ""Interstellar."" Hell be seeing it in a movie theater like you and me. So this is the greatest Shyamalan movie ever made by someone else or maybe its Christopher Nolans best impression of what a Shyamalan movie ought to be like. No doubt that sounds like a backhanded compliment but I dont entirely mean it that way. Whether you think ""Interstellar"" is Nolans big breakthrough to a new level of emotional populism or a sideways slide into mainstream glop is largely a function of your perspective on this talented illusionist and his entire career. Oh and heres the warning Im going to discuss some conceptual elements of ""Interstellar"" that some people may understand as spoilers but I promise I wont go beyond the barest plot synopsis.Nolans core fans if theyre honest with themselves will feel conflicted about ""Interstellar"" and some may feel subtly let down. This is a tremendous popcorn flick loaded with thrills and chills along with plenty of film-school references for those who wish to chase them. But the hard-edged technophilia and post-adolescent nihilism of the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy are dialed down almost to zero. This movies exciting and sometimes moving but Im not sure how cool it is. Theres another obvious reference point besides Shyamalan in mainstream cinema Jonathan Nolan Christophers brother and co-writer first developed this script in the mid-2000s as a project for Steven Spielberg and the finished product carries the grand ambition pop calculation and fatal hubris of a Spielbergian spectacle. (The Spielberg version of ""Interstellar"" would of course star Tom Cruise and here and there you can feel McConaughey fending off that specter.) Has Christopher Nolan grown increasingly desperate to win that elusive Oscar and made a decision to go for the heart rather than the brain? Maybe a little but Im not saying ""Interstellar"" is a cynical move. Its more like trying out a new persona that of ""A-list Hollywood director"" rather than ""beloved cult genius."" It fits or pretty close.Lets start with the big picture ""Interstellar"" which is sure to be one of the biggest box-office draws of the year and a probable Oscar nominee is terrific roller-coaster entertainment with some plot twists youll see a mile away and others that sneak up on you. Despite some awkward expository dialogue where people tell each other things they already know -- ""Hey remember when the rain stopped and the crops failed and we had to give up technology just to keep ourselves alive? Member that?"" - the Nolan brothers screenplay ingeniously unpacks a series of scientific and/or supernatural riddles that at first seem incompatible. Theres just enough quantum mechanics for physics geeks to admit that the films space-travel scenario is halfway or hypothetically plausible (physicist Kip Thorne served as a script consultant) and just enough deep-background deistic teleology for those who want to dream of a Grand Design.After a leisurely earth-bound liftoff - maybe a bit too leisurely -- we visit wormholes black holes forbidding alien worlds and time-space paradoxes. As youd expect Nolans effects team does stunning even superlative work advancing classic images and tropes of science fiction into a new era. This is Nolans first film with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (of ""Let the Right One In"" and ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") and the pictures have an appealing rawness a notch or two more naturalistic than the perfect sheen delivered by longtime collaborator Wally Pfister who shot every Nolan film from ""Memento"" to ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Whether on Earth or in space theres a haunted shadowy slightly off-center quality to Van Hoytemas frames which conveys the highly relevant sense that some of the story is taking place off-screen in realms or dimensions we dont see.At this point its almost a reflex action in sci-fi cinema to refer back to Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and Andrei Tarkovskys ""Solaris"" those tragic-elegiac masterpieces of another age. I will leave it to dissertation authors of the future to figure out all the elements Nolan pilfers reworks and recombines from those two films but he is certainly playing a deeper game than random quotation. No doubt its too simplistic to say that Nolan is trying to push astronaut Dave Bowmans transcendental journey in ""2001"" toward a more satisfying (and comprehensible) outcome or to figure out who what and where the mysterious Starchild cosmic-embryo thingummy might be. But thats somewhere in the right analytical ballpark as is the argument that hes trying to render the symbolic homecoming in ""Solaris"" into an event in physical reality rather than an imprecise metaphor for God or art or Russia or the Eternal Something. Whether those movies required a conceptual mashup/remake aimed at a 21st century mass audience is a more difficult question.""Interstellar"" begins in an odd slow mode of apocalyptic lamentation as if it were ending before it had started. This could be a clue to the Nolans Mobius-strip narrative structure as are the documentary-style snippets that seem to be about the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. (On second viewing a lot of that material will yield new information.) But in fact the onetime ace test pilot and engineer called Coop (McConaughey) is living amid some near-future Dust Bowl America when nothing but corn will grow anymore (and less and less of that) and renegade Indian Air Force drones fly overhead long severed from their terrestrial commanders. Of course Nolan knows hes channeling all sorts of heartland-set farm-family movies including ""Field of Dreams"" and Shyamalans ""Signs."" But its highly unfortunate that the most recent and strikingly similar multiplex example is the Mark Wahlberg-led robot-infested farmstead of Michael Bays ""Transformers Age of Extinction."" You Might Also Like While the mood of these early scenes is eloquent and elegant you cant help wondering how the hell this lugubrious tale about a nation and a planet skidding into the ecological Dumpster will send its protagonist into outer space. With a bang and a zoom thats how. Something or someone is sending the family messages by knocking books off the shelves and arranging dust on the floor; Coops daughter Murph played by Mackenzie Foy as a child and later by Chastain says its a poltergeist. (Yes this is a farm family where people are named Coop and Murph. No doubt Sarge Bucky and Hawk are out in the fields.)Without going into specifics lets just say that Coop and Murph discover that NASA still exists despite officially having been defunded and oh yeah they need Coop to fly a spaceship through a newly discovered wormhole out near Jupiter and thence into a distant galaxy in search of viable planets since ours is toast. (As a bumper sticker you used to see in the Pacific Northwest puts it ""Earth First. Well log the other planets later."") Coop is a widower long a Hollywood device to raise the pathos level and the heros swoon-worthiness but also a fact that ought to make it extra unlikely he will bail out on his kids. But before you have time to say ""What the hey?"" Coop takes his protein pills puts his helmet on and blasts into the movies second chapter leaving his family (including his teenage son played by Timothee Chalamet and later by Casey Affleck and his aging father-in-law a pleasurably laconic John Lithgow) behind on a dying planet with only a microscopic possibility - given the unknown nature of his destination and what we know about relativity and high-speed space travel - that hell ever see them again.McConaughey holds the screen beautifully fixing his iconic mug on the boundary of fate whether hes driving an ancient Dodge pickup through Nebraskastan or piloting a deep-space probe toward mysterious planets a bit too close to a black holes event horizon. Obviously the space mission is what we came for and thats the best stuff in ""Interstellar"" intense suspenseful and heartbreaking. Coop is accompanied to infinity and beyond by a persnickety scientist named Amelia Brand (Hathaway) who may have her own agenda a pair of more disposable crew members played by Wes Bentley and David Gyasi and a wisecracking robot named TARS voiced by Bill Irwin a completely idiotic and counter-logical idea that totally works. (In addition to those more serious movies I mentioned theres just a little bit of the campy 60s TV series ""Lost in Space"" at work in ""Interstellar."") As Coop and his crew travel from one mind-blowing otherworldly scenario to another looking for bread crumb trails suggesting that previous voyagers have found a new home for the human race theyre acutely aware that time is passing at a different rate back on Earth and is literally running out. Even if Coop comes back alive his kids are likely to be long dead of old age - and his grandkids are likely to suffocate in a poisoned atmosphere. Heres where we start getting to my litany of objections to ""Interstellar"" which begin with the fact that every time Nolan encounters an enormous hole in storytelling logic - or scientific logic or even theological logic because there is such a thing - he blasts through it at light-speed hoping well be dazzled into not noticing.Nolan has said that he hopes the movie will encourage renewed public interest in space travel which is now seen in most Western countries as an expensive and unnecessary luxury. I entirely support that goal; I think its a great historic mistake to hold science hostage to neoliberal economics or to abandon it to autocratic regimes like Russia and China. But for all the philosophical nostrums and pop physics in ""Interstellar"" Nolan waffles so much on the horrifying and ludicrous notion that we should abandon our planet and go find another one to rape that I honestly cant tell you where he comes down or even exactly how the movie ends. (I would also argue that the Nolans have grossly and irritatingly misread Dylan Thomas famous villanelle ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" which is about the unquenchable unavoidable tragedy of the death of one individual and not at all about the human species. But thats become a pop-culture staple and its pointless to complain.)Then again maybe the problem is that the Spielberg-Shyamalan mask of sentimental populism doesnt entirely fit and that Nolan cant help playing a game of bait-and-switch with his audience. ""Interstellar"" is thrilling to watch across its moments but ultimately unmemorable; I feel it slipping away from me even now. Its an almost convincing simulation of a great mainstream movie made by an entity from another dimension who sees our flaws with a mixture of amusement and dim theoretical sympathy but who finally doesnt care whether we save our planet or not whether we live in reality or delusion whether we rage against the dying of the light or suck the tailpipe of our self-constructed engine of doom and die.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post It may not be quite as magical as Dorothy Gale stepping from her sepia-toned farmhouse into the Technicolor burg of Munchkinland but it comes mighty close. There is a scene in director Christopher Nolans oft-spectacular doggedly humane space epic ""Interstellar"" that shifts from deep space back to Earth from a father who hasnt aged much physically to a daughter all grown up. Matthew McConaughey is ace pilot and astronaut Cooper. Jessica Chastain plays adult daughter Murph. The difference captured in this moment was everything Cooper feared about leaving his heartland farm son and daughter for a last-gasp mission to find an inhabitable planet for Earths population. Before this scene Murph was as an adventuresome girl (Mackenzie Foy). Son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) reflects Coopers belief in responsibility. Casey Affleck steps into his dust-covered boots as a struggling farmer in a famine ravaged world. Blight is gobbling up the last of the worlds food crops. Wheats finished. Okras just had its final harvest. (Hold your applause.) The Coopers acres of corn will slowly die. Influenced by Ken Burns documentary series about the ravages of the Dust Bowl Nolan weaves in fictionalized video of personal narratives about that man-made ecological disaster. (Yes the woman who looks like Ellen Burstyn is indeed the award-winning actress.) In the midst of their dust-coated life Coopers youngest proved to be his partner in scientific revelry in rule-bending jaunts. It is the two of them who discover that NASA has gone underground. That the space program Cooper had trained for -- before the world required ""caretakers"" not pioneers -- still exists. Nolan veteran Michael Caine portrays Professor Brand. Hes working on a project to get humans through a wormhole that has been discovered near Saturn. If -- and its the biggest ""if"" of all -- Brand and a crew of astronauts can find a sustaining home. In this sci-fi fable of fathers and daughters Anne Hathaway plays Brands daughter astronaut Amelia Brand. Movies journey to space -- at least the best of them -- to contemplate Earth. They hurl headlong into the future to ponder the past and the present. We escape into their multiplex fantasies to re-engage emotional realities. Nolan grasps this better than any purveyor of mass movie entertainment since Steven Spielberg. The director is as compassionate as Spielberg and far more cerebral and bold. Co-written by director and brother Jonathan Nolan this three-hour adventure begs repeat visits. While the challenges Coop Amelia Doyle (Ben Bentley) Romilly (David Gyasi) and two mechanical colleagues TARS and CASE face may be the stuff of sci-fi musings the quandaries that underlie them resonate For instance what do you do when your honorable job no longer serves the needs of the community? The theory of relativity -- vetted by executive producer and renowned astrophysicist Kip Thorne -- meets theories of relatives of loved ones. What is love exactly? In the midst of a deep-space crisis Amelia riffs on that question with philosophical poetics worth considering. ""Interstellar"" is as much about time as it is about space. The Nolans make fine and sorrow-infused sense of time for the spaceship crew. An hour in space is 7 years on Earth. Who will be lost in that span? ""Interstellar"" is as cinematically epic as it is dramatically intimate. A wide and high wave of dust bears down on a small town. On go the dust masks the goggles like a duck-and-cover drop-and-roll routine. A mountainous wall of water crests making a spaceship a vulnerable dingy. A frozen cloud is a thing of wonder -- with dangerous edges. Could a jagged icy tundra be our new home? Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema use a great number of close-ups making the human drama old-fashioned even melodramatic. Cinemas special gift gave us larger-than-life movie stars. Here the close-ups beseech us to identify. To find our place in the heroic. As desperate as the situation is -- and there is ego and arrogance good intentions and mistakes made throughout -- the film has a hushed persistent beat of optimism. ""Well find a way. We always have"" says Cooper. ""Interstellar"" keeps us guessing whether this gift for surviving has finally run out.

Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar. Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures Time is a circle just like Matthew McConaughey said in True Detective. But it isnt flat. Its spherical. Interstellar Christopher Nolans saline-and-starlight-streaked space-time epic is so beautiful and ambitious and enveloping that to tick down its imperfections -- drippy homilies about how love especially the paternal kind can transcend dimensions; an over-investment in its widower McCona-heros Chuck Yeager/Han Solo-esque expertise on the stick; abuse of a familiar Dylan Thomas quote -- ultimately feels small. Released the week after two spaceflight disasters one of them fatal the movie is at once a hardscrabble vision of humanitys darkest night (it opens with talking-head clips from Ken Burns 2012 PBS documentary The Dust Bowl cannily blended with new footage) and a forceful -- if not wholly convincing -- declaration that we shall outlive our home planet. Human Exceptionalism you might call its philosophy. And yet of all the (not that many) kinda-sorta-plausible-ish space exploration flicks to launch since 2001 A Space Odyssey -- which predated Neil Armstrongs historic moonwalk by more than a year -- Interstellar is the most mercilessly awe-inducing. Even if you gag on its payload of sentiment as many have and shall it is the film of 2014 that demands to be experienced on the biggest screen available. Nolan would prefer that you see it in 70mm IMAX if you can; Paramount is making a well-publicized exception to its recent switch to exclusively digital exhibition formats just for him. Thats what three wildly successful Bat-movies buy you. For Christopher Nolan Making Interstellar Was A Childhood Dream Listen  741 741 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed Transcript In the scenario cooked up by Nolans brother Jonathan with an intellectual kick-start from astrophysicist Kip Thorne our spendthrift 20th century ways have caught up with us in the unspecified middle or late 21st. Global famine and food wars have drastically thinned our herd. Militaries have disbanded (say what?) and almost everyone -- even hotshot former test pilots like our man Cooper who remembers the Good Old Days even though hes only in his 40s -- works the land which now yields only corn. NASA is a secret organization led by Michael Caine Nolans go-to man for gravitas. In fact his character is literally a gravity expert one who has spent decades trying to crack an equation that will enable humanitys migration to Somewhere Else. Whats more his team -- Anne Hathaway David Gyasi and Wes Bentley plus a sarcastic military-surplus robot voiced and manipulated at least in some scenes by the brilliant elastic-limbed clown Bill Irwin -- have identified a dozen potentially habitable planets accessible via wormhole those express lanes across the cosmos that Thorne has theorized. NASAs best guess is that the wormhole and the planets were put there for us by extraterrestrial intellects vast cool and weirdly sympathetic. But they need Coopers Right Stuff to get to Saturn where the wormhole is. Its unclear who was going to handle the driving if an eventually explained series of mysterious portents hadnt led Cooper and Murph his 10-year-old budding genius daughter to their secret lair. The Earthbound first act feels a lot like the Spielberg picture this was once set to be. (Also like M. Night Shyamalans thriller Signs starring Americas favorite stoic widower circa 2002 Mel Gibson.) As with every Nolan movie theres a clockwork narrative logic to it that eventually reveals itself even if your willing suspension of disbelief has burned up by then. Anyway Cooper must leave behind his two kids -- Murph and Tom her less gifted big brother -- to try to save the species. Kubrick wouldnt have wasted a tear on an equation as lopsided as that but Nolan turns on the waterworks (and Hans Zimmers church-organ score) cutting from the bereft Coopers drive away from his Norman Rockwell-esque house to the countdown of his rocket. Its the first of many bravura dialogue-free moments that make Interstellars 169 minutes feel ... well like less than 169 minutes. (I saw it twice in three days and I was never bored.) Heres another Their spacecraft bearing the weary designation Endurance pinwheels across the rings of Saturn while we hear the thunderstorm-sounds recording Gyasi is playing on his headphones. I wouldnt have minded a bit if Nolan had lingered on these space vistas more than he does. (Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema of Let the Right One In and Her has composed frames well worth the extra few bucks to see them in true IMAX.) But hes got a supermassive (and highly spoilable) story to tell one that keeps him rushing even given the lengthy run time. One thing Kubrick never was was hurried. Iceland stands in for a pair of beautiful forbidding planets but its most stunning environments are computer visualizations born of legit science Thorne gave the films army of digital effects artists the equations to visualize both the wormhole and the black hole seen in the film leading to breakthroughs in ""gravitational lensing."" Nolan had reserved the right to assert artistic license if the images Thornes equations produced were too plain or simply too weird for audiences to process but the objects his data generated -- a shiny black soap-bubble in space and a black hole with a fiery halo of starlight wrapped around it like the string of a yo-yo -- are what we see. ""This is our observational data"" Thorne told Wired magazine. ""Thats the way nature behaves. Period."" (This is not to say others dont take issue with the science on the whole as astronomer Phil Plait does in Slate.) Nolan made his name with Memento a tricksy mystery that moved in two temporal directions at once. In the 14 years since his movies have swollen to monumental scale but he still compresses and elongates the fourth dimension more poetically than any other blockbuster-maker. Who better than him to make a film dealing so explicitly with relativity? Other good sci-fi pictures have addressed the existential sanity-testing loneliness of sailing across eternity in a can. Interstellar does that too but its probably the first presumptive blockbuster to grapple even clumsily with the problem that everyone you loved back on your home world would almost certainly grow to surpass you in age. (It takes two years in cryo-sleep just to get to the wormhole apart from the time-dilation problem.) Some of the consequences of this make for stirring emotional stuff even if the movie isnt as profound as it wants us to believe. Nolan a director often accused of coldness finally got all mushy when he went to outer space. I cant solve that equation but Ive enjoyed trying to scratch it out.

By Peter Travers November 5 2014 More News The Top 20 Sci-Fi Films of the 21st Century Watch First Trailer for Interstellar Down-to-Earth Actress Jessica Chastain Is Hollywoods Most Wanted Newcomer All Stories >> Its damn near three hours long. Theres that. Also Interstellar is a space odyssey with no UFOs no blue-skinned creatures from another planet no alien bursting from the chest of star Matthew McConaughey. It reveals a hopeful side of filmmaker Christopher Nolan that will piss off Dark Knight doomsayers. And hey didnt Alfonso Cuaron just win an Oscar for directing Gravity? How long are audiences expected to get high on rocket fumes? More News The Top 20 Sci-Fi Films of the 21st Century Watch First Trailer for Interstellar Down-to-Earth Actress Jessica Chastain Is Hollywoods Most Wanted Newcomer All Stories >> Blah blah blah. Bitch bitch bitch. What the neg-heads are missing about Interstellar is how enthralling it is how gracefully it blends the cosmic and the intimate how deftly it explores the infinite in the smallest human details. Of course Nolan has never been the cold technician of his reputation. Watch Memento again or The Prestige or the undervalued Insomnia. The sticking point here is that Interstellar finds Nolan wearing his heart on his sleeve. Nothing like emotion to hold a cool dude up to ridicule. But even when Nolan strains to verbalize feelings and the script he wrote with his brother Jonathan turns clunky its hard not to root for a visionary whos reaching for the stars. Which brings us to a plot full of deepening surprises Im not going to spoil. The poster for Interstellar presents McConaughey surveying a wasteland. Its meant to be Saturn but it could just as well be Earth where environmental recklessness has morphed the planet into a Dirt Bowl starving and choking its citizens. Nolan spends the first third of the film in the American farm belt of the near future introducing us to widower Cooper (McConaughey) a former test pilot who depends on his father-in-law (John Lithgow) to help him raise 15-year-old son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and 10-year-old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy superb). Like her dad Murph is a rebel who refuses to buy into her schools official dictum that the Apollo space program was a lie. Its when dad and daughter find the remnants of NASA headed up by Coopers old boss Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that the story gains momentum. Cooper heads into space to find a new world to colonize leaving behind two kids who may never forgive him. The physics lessons (Cal-techs Kip Thorne consulted) kick in when Coop captains the Endurance mother ship with a science team made up of Amelia (Anne Hathaway) Brands daughter; Romilly (David Gyasi); and Doyle (Wes Bentley). And dont forget R2-D2 and C-3PO. Not really. The ex-military robots of Interstellar are called CASE and TARS. The great Bill Irwin voices TARS a chatty monolith that looks like something out of Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey and sounds like that films HAL. (Note to viewers Kubricks 1968 landmark and George Lucas Star Wars franchise are part of Nolans DNA. React accordingly.) Next comes the wow factor that makes Interstellar nirvana for movie lovers. A high-tension docking maneuver. A surprise visitor. A battle on the frozen tundra. A tidal wave the size of a mountain. Cheers to Nolan and his team led by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and VFX supervisor Paul J. Franklin (Inception). See Interstellar in IMAX with the thrilling images oomphed by Hans Zimmers score and youll get the meaning of ""rock the house."" And yet its the final quieter hour of Interstellar that gives the film resonance and lasting value. All the talk of black holes wormholes and the space-time continuum take root in Coop when he realizes his two years in space have occupied 23 years on Earth. His children the now-adult Tom (Casey Affleck) and Murphy (Jessica Chastain) spill out decades of joys and resentments in video messages that Coop watches in stunned silence. McConaughey nails every nuance without underlining a single one of them. Hes a virtuoso his face a road map to the life hes missed as his children bombard him with a Rorschach test of emotions. In case you havent noticed McConaughey is on a roll. And he partners beautifully with the sublime Chastain who infuses Murph with amazing grit and grace. Familial love is the topic here not the romantic or sexual kind. How does that figure into space exploration? Nolan gives Hathaway a monologue about it. But dialogue is no match for the flinty eloquence shining from the eyes of McConaughey and Chastain. They are the bruised heart of Interstellar a film that trips up only when it tries to make love a science with rules to be applied. In 2001 Kubrick saw a future that was out of our hands. For Nolan our reliance on one another is all weve got. Thats more the stuff of provocation than a Hallmark e-card. Nolan believes its better to think through a movie than to just sit through it. If that makes him a white knight Godspeed.

PHOTOS McConaugheys hottest moments But Christopher Nolans big-budget cosmic epic -- while compelling and truly magnificent in scope -- is ultimately weighed down by its own ambition. Still what a thrilling ride it is. You thought Gravity was an immersive lost-in-space experience? Just you wait. We start in a chilling not-so-distant future when dust storms have ravaged Earth. Food is at a premium. Science and medicine are practically defunct as most boys and girls aspire to be farmers. Even the New York Yankees only draw a smattering of fans at their games. PHOTOS Hathaways style evolution A sliver of hope rests with Cooper (Matthew McConaughey a superb space cowboy) a former NASA pilot and devoted single father of two. After stumbling upon his former stomping grounds -- dont try to make sense of this -- he finds his former mentor (Michael Caine) and immediately gets tasked with heading up a space mission. (Three others including Caines daughter an engineer played by Anne Hathaway are also along for the ride). All Coop has to do to save mankind is zoom through a wormhole to another galaxy and find a habitable planet. Its a one-way ticket. Time is elastic in space and in a blink Coopers bright 10-year-old daughter is a brilliant adult (Jessica Chastain) still bitter that her beloved dad deserted her. The pairs deep emotional bond -- notably illustrated in a touching teary-eyed scene in which Cooper watches dated messages from Chastain and his now-grown son (Casey Affleck) -- help humanize a convoluted and occasionally plodding story. PHOTOS Chastains chic red carpet looks Chastain and Affleck Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros Indeed only an expert in quantum physics might fully understand the nuances of Coopers out-of-this-world journey. Inside the vessel the astronauts speak of the powers of gravity and the space-time continuum in a clinical manner befitting of a college classroom. McConaughey and Hathaways lack of chemistry doesnt help matters. Apparently once you leave Earth you become immune to the actors charms. Nolan (who wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan) poses grand themes here ranging from science vs. reason to man vs. nature. But the heavy-handed cerebral exposition -- that culminates in a far-out and way-too-tidy climax -- may just leave audiences wondering about the basic plot holes over the wormholes. What was that about the wristwatch and the fifth dimension? (No really. This development alone requires multiple viewings.) PHOTOS Movies that make celeb hunks cry Still you cant say that Nolan (the Dark Knight trilogy Inception) doesnt keep things interesting over a three-hour period. A cinematic visionary he deserves accolades for his ability to create striking images such as the rings of Saturn and an ice cloud. A mile-high tidal wave that greets the crew after they touch down on one water-logged planet is absolutely breathtaking. In that moment the astronomy is irrelevant; all that matters is that the crew needs to escape to survive. Immediately. That kind of gripping action makes this film a standout. So perhaps its best to just let the mind go free here and simply behold the dazzling spectacle.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Nov. 04 2014 528PM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 07 2014 1201PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Christopher Nolan Written by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan Starring Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain Classification PG Country USA Language English Director Christopher Nolans new space movie Interstellar is a film you really need to see to disbelieve. Its a 169-minute time-travelling space-jumping father-daughter love story that takes a wormhole journey across the galaxies and all the way from awesome to awful. While its technically eye-popping and intricately structured Interstellar is at its most fascinating when it struggles hard to communicate those things we human beings call ""emotions"". Instead we get something like a freeze-dried approximation of Steven Spielberg at his most sentimental. Video Video Why Matthew McConaughey went sci-fi with Interstellar video Video Christopher Nolan cements his place in Hollywood Its no surprise that Nolan arguably the leading blockbuster filmmaker of the century delivers complication and monumentality. And food for thought He has made some ingenious head-game movies (Memento The Prestige Inception). He has also turned comic books into Wagnerian myth in a trio of oppressively grim and hugely popular Dark Knight movies. Interstellar is something new a movie thats personal and precious and loopy like Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life or Darren Aronofskys much ridiculed The Fountain. Think Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey by way of M. Night Shyamalans Signs and youll get an inkling of how wildly uneven Interstellar is.A lot is generically familiar Time travel and aging at different rates cheeky robots dying planets - all ideas that reach across the entire space-time continuum of sci-fi movies. The biggest claim for originality is in the elaborate visual modelling. The visualizations of black holes wormholes (a theoretically possible tunnel between a sucking black hole and a spewing white hole) represented by silver and black spheres and discs with orange aureolas and swirling funnels. These images (we are told) possess unprecedented scientific accuracy thanks to the guidance of producer-adviser astrophysicist Kip Thorne who also worked on the movie Contact based on Carl Sagans novel.No doubt quibblers will quibble. In a recent Facebook post French astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Luminet says Thorne conceded he cheated in the symmetry of the accretion disc of matter around the black hole because asymmetry ""was much harder for a mass audience to grasp."" Stupid mass audiences and their stupid need for symmetry.Graspable symmetry may also explain why the plot involves two troubled father-daughter relationships two foreign planets and two talking robots. As with Nolans previous films his structures feel compulsively complicated.The opening of the film is set in the future or rather the far future looking back at our near future - Ill stop now. Old men and women (as in Warren Beattys Reds) are seen talking in direct-to-camera interviews (one of them is Ellen Burstyn) about the bad old days of the Dust Bowl when everyone was a farmer. Thats not the Dust Bowl of the 1930s but a similar one in our future when the Earth is on the verge of running out of resources.A weather-beaten wooden house appears onscreen amid a corn field (The Wizard of Oz? Superman?). The resident farmer is Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a widowed former test pilot for NASA who lives with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) mostly ignored teen son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and doted-on daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). There are computers and even some old drones flying about but in the new curiously technophobic present the government keeps everyone in the dark. The schools teach that the Apollo missions were all faked a way of bankrupting the Soviet Union with a propaganda program.Cooper grumbles ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder about our place in the stars now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dirt.""His adorable and bright daughter Murph still believes in the moon landing and (heres the part where it gets all M. Night Shyamalan) also believes she has a ghost in her book-lined bedroom. One night some apparently supernatural activity results in dust marks on her bedroom floor which Cooper recognizes as map co-ordinates. He finds a location where the old NASA has a secret hideout under the auspices of Professor Brand (Michael Caine) who is working on a plans to relocate Earths endangered population to another hospitable planet. A wormhole has opened up near Saturn possibly engineered by some superior beings from another galaxy. Several astronauts have already been sent ahead on a scouting mission and have sent back reports of new potential habitats.""Mankind was born on Earth"" Brand declares. ""It was never meant to die here."" (Huh?)Brand wants Cooper to pilot a new mission to save humanity and Cooper readily agrees. His son Tom wants to know if he can have the truck but Murph takes the news hard. She is devastated by her fathers decision to leave but at the movies half-hour point Coopers rocket docks with a spaceship called Endurance (after Sir Ernest Shackletons doomed Antarctic craft).The crew includes Brands scientist daughter the bob-haired Amelia (Anne Hathaway named after Amelia Earhart) a brittle know-it-all who shows some sparks of antagonistic attraction toward Cooper. Later Amelia mentions another astronaut named ""Mann"" who has gone before them. (She actually utters the line ""Mann can save us."") Amelia also offers an unscientific soliloquy about how ""love"" may solve this whole space-time gravity issue that she wasted her career worrying about. For a tremulous moment I thought she was going to break into I Dreamed A Dream from Les Miserables.There are a couple of other barely sketched characters an astrophysicist Romilly (David Gyasi) and co-pilot Doyle (Wes Bentley) and one of those standard-issue smart-alecky computers named TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin). Throughout Hans Zimmers music throbs obtrusively occasionally fighting with the dialogue for our attention.McConaugheys good ol boy stoner-philosopher persona is the one performance that really works here even when hes speaking in mouthfuls of techno-babble or declaring lines like ""Impossible but necessary"" before hitting the throttle. Strange misadventures revelations and precarious escapes follow in succession but the overall design becomes increasingly allegorical.Mann pops up played by a famous star who Im not supposed to name (no its not George Clooney) but who shows us that Mann alone cannot save us. Otherwise the takeaway is that time takes our children and parents away from us faster than we think. When the crew visits a grimly inhospitable planet for three hours 23 years pass back on Earth and Coopers daughter Murph (Jessica Chastain) has morphed into a woman in her 30s still sending angry messages to her deadbeat dad through the wormhole. Though her character is emotionally arrested she too has become a brilliant physicist (the movie is thick with them) and is working for the aged Brand who constantly likes intoning Dylan Thomass poem for his dying father Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night to emphasize the inextinguishable flame of human hope.Apart from a few blessed moments when Zimmers music shuts up and we get to see those spacey images theres little sublime witty joyous or vivacious about Interstellar. To his credit though Nolan never plays it safe creating a movie that grows more eccentric and absurd as it rolls along ending in some manic cross-cutting between space and Earth and wrapping up with a couple of pointedly poignant symmetrical codas. By the closing credits it seems possible that Nolan himself hails from another planet and while he has tried diligently to show humanity in a flattering light he lacks enough inside information to get it right.Editors note An earlier version of this review incorrectly identified the astronaut Mann as Amelias love interest.

Interstellar (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Interstellar (PG-13) Director Christopher Nolans sci-fi epic is his most daring film to date. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezmiamiherald.com11/5/2014 Editor rating 3 Interstellar the new genre-defying epic by director Christopher Nolan (Inception The Prestige The Dark Knight trilogy) is such a huge expansive movie that it fills your head until it threatens to overflow. You walk out of the theater dazzled jazzed overwhelmed relieved and for those without a degree in quantum physics a tad confused (also a little deaf if you see it in IMAX which you absolutely should). This is Nolans unabashed tribute to 2001 A Space Odyssey the first movie he ever saw at the age of 8 and the one that made him decide to be a filmmaker (there are homages to that earlier film everywhere). Only unlike Kubricks work the movie isnt pure cold science It has heart and emotion and is populated by real people so dont be surprised if you walk out of the theater a little teary-eyed too. Only later when you start thinking about it Interstellar starts to short-circuit -- much like Inception theres little of substance underneath that elaborate surface. Watching it though is a pure thrill. Nolans mind-bending ideas and visuals combine the power of a craftsman such as Kubrick with an entertainer such as Spielberg. There are several long setpieces in the movie including one in which a shuttle is trying in vain to dock with a larger space station that is so suspenseful it made me groan with delight. You know what also made me groan but for totally different reasons? The dense scientific jargon about quantum physics and relativity and gravity and wormholes and time that will be incomprehensible to most audiences. Understanding every bit of Interstellars fact-based speculative science isnt essential to enjoying the movie -- this is first and foremost a gigantic joyful ride and a celebration of pure cinema -- but a little less mumbo-jumbo and more clearly explained ideas (such as a planet in which every hour you spend on equals seven years on Earth) would have benefited the movie and shaved a little time from its mammoth 169 minutes. Youre never bored watching Interstellar but there are times when you sit back waiting for a scene to end because you have no idea what the characters are talking about unless youre a Harvard grad-level physicist and even they will have to take notes. Set in a near-future in which the worlds military forces have collapsed and giant dust storms are rendering our planet toxic Interstellar revolves around a risky mission in which four astronauts -- former Air Force pilot Matthew McConaughey and scientists Anne Hathaway Wes Bentley and David Gyasi -- are asked to travel to a wormhole near Saturn. The idea is to go through and hopefully find another planet capable of sustaining human life. This is the second such mission The first launched 10 years earlier resulted in messages from the astronauts claiming they had found three promising candidates. But the voyage will keep McConaughey a farmer away from Earth for untold years which breaks his daughters heart (shes played as a child by Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain). She cannot forgive her dad for choosing mankind over her. He promises hell be back but he doesnt know if thats a promise hell be able to keep. Thats the set-up for an unpredictable adventure filled with stunning sights and visuals (theres a beautiful shot of Saturn the protagonists spacecraft a tiny dot next to the gargantuan planet). There are traces of whimsy too such as the two unusual robots accompanying the astronauts perhaps the most personable robotic duo in a live-action movie since C3PO and R2D2. Nolan wants to blow your mind the way Kubrick did and he achieves it several times. But his attempt at giving the story some emotional heat and humanity -- the elements 2001 lacked -- dont work as well as they should. The actors arent at fault Theres just too much of everything and one critical sequence near the end filled with wonderful effects that are new to film but also with a preordained conclusion goes on so long I started glancing at my watch. Nolan who can make a cornfield look as stunning as an aurora borealis still hasnt gotten the knack of making his puzzle pieces fit (Memento is probably his most solid movie although even that one is a bit iffy). But even an imperfect Nolan movie is better than most of the genre pictures that have cluttered screens this year. His creativity and daring excite and inspire you. They make you love the art of filmmaking more. This is what movies used to do instead of recycling things youve seen a million times before. Also watching a science-fiction movie that takes science seriously is refreshing (Guardians of the Galaxy was fantastic but that was simply a terrific comic-book movie). As usual Nolans frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer has come up with a score that fits the impossible dimensions of the film and the music adds tremendously to the excitement. (Curiously Nolan who is obsessive about sound mixing flubs a critical line reading by Michael Caine that imparts some critical information; you can barely understand what hes saying but fortunately someone repeats it in the next scene). McConaugheys renaissance continues Hes required to play practically every emotional note imaginable and he hits them all. Hathaway isnt quite as convincing as a scientist and she also gets the movies worst speech but shes passable and doesnt ruin the movie. For all its flaws Interstellar is required viewing for anyone who appreciates the majesty movies are capable of the way they can fool us into thinking weve been transported into another galaxy and for anyone who wants to see things theyve never seen before. This isnt Nolans best movie but his ambitions and trust in the audience keep getting bigger. Hes one of Hollywoods few true remaining visionaries and hes only getting warmed up.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Christopher Nolan is not a very emotive filmmaker and for this reason is often mistaken for cerebral which he isnt. Nolan is a dork aesthete par excellence. Self-serious literalist fussy with intercutting fixated on exposition his movies snake around protracted reveals and delayed twists. His latest the nearly three-hour Interstellar comes closer to mimicking the feel and structure of 20th-century hard sci-fi in the Arthur C. Clarke mode than just about any other movie. It is an episodic chunky film of over-explicated ideas and speculative set pieces a race against the clock on a severely time-dilated planet; a spacecraft trying to outrun a mile-high tidal wave; trips through wormholes; treks across a world covered by mountain-like formations of frozen cloud. Theres a definite space-station-cover paperback charm to the way Interstellar practices sci-fi the lean characters known only by their surnames; the geeky cool of the old-school team robot TARS a bulky metal rectangle with a disconcertingly human voice; the wide-eyed garbling of textbook science. In its best stretches which tend to come in the middle it is a fatalistic adventure that pits peaceful science types against themselves and each other as they struggle to achieve a greater goal; in its worst moments toward the end it is a dopey exercise in humanist metaphysics a movie about facing the cosmic unknown that explains everything several times over.In more ways than one this is Nolans Solaris. Both movies open with a long stretch set around a country house on Earth where the protagonist a widower must consider a mission to space from which he wont return for years possibly decades. In both cases hes leaving behind a young girl and an older man--his niece and father in Solaris his daughter and father-in-law in Interstellar. Both films shift the action into space abruptly are set partly to organ music (Bach in Andrei Tarkovskys Solaris and one of Hans Zimmers better scores in Interstellar) feature extended sequences of the protagonists watching and reacting to video recordings and are about the emotions of people faced with the unknown. And when it all comes down to it both films are about how their respective writer-directors feel about the notion of the unknowable and humanitys relationship to something larger than itself. Suffice it to say that Nolan is neither as confident nor as thoughtful a filmmaker as Tarkovsky nor does anyone expect him to be. But as Interstellars space-time jargon gives way to maudlin truisms and increasingly New Age mumbo-jumbo about the power of love a viewer might begin to wish that Nolan had ideas that went beyond making space exploration look as dishwater gray as photochemically possible.Interstellars hero is Coop (Matthew McConaughey) an engineer and former test pilot now eking out a living as a scrapper and corn farmer in a hopeless depopulated future where the Earth is being ravaged by an agricultural parasite called the Blight. (One of Nolans more eccentric flourishes involves intercutting the early scenes with interviews with Dust Bowl survivors who function like the talking heads in Warren Beattys Reds.) The United States government has long collapsed and there are intimations of a global war that occurred in the distant past. In one of the movies standout sequences Coops pickup rips through the cornfields trying to catch up with a descending Indian military drone hoping to get a hold of the solar cells that have kept it flying in circles forgotten for decades. Coop is raising his two children--whip-smart daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and barely sketched son Tom (Timothee Chalamet)--with the help of Donald (John Lithgow) the father of his late wife. (For those keeping score this brings the dead wife count in Nolans movies up to five plus Rachel Dawes who functions as a de facto dead wife in the Dark Knight films.) A mysterious gravitational anomaly eventually leads Coop and Murph to the NORAD bunker where the last remnants of NASA led by Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) have put together a plan to relocate humanity to another solar system using a wormhole that appeared just behind Saturn half a century earlier. A dozen scientists have already sacrificed themselves by taking one-way missions through the wormhole in search of habitable planets; three have sent back promising data. Now a team--what the NASA folks call Plan A--has to go and find which one of the three planets is most suitable for resettlement. There are only enough resources for one mission and only a limited quantity of fuel which sets up Plan B; if the team finds a habitable planet but cant return they are to settle it themselves using thousands of frozen zygotes stored on their craft and leave the Earth to die. Seemingly within 15 minutes of arriving at NORAD Coop is asked to lead the team alongside Brands daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway). Because of the effects of relativity--which Interstellar explains at least five times--several decades will pass on Earth while Coop Amelia Romilly (David Gyasi) and Doyle (Wes Bentley) will be away on their mission.Nolan is a frustratingly haphazard visual stylist fixated on celluloid formats (Interstellar was shot in anamorphic 35mm IMAX and VistaVision) limited color schemes and lens flares but incapable of organizing space or structuring a shot in which more than one thing happens. Sometimes this incoherence works to his advantage; it takes a good hour of close-ups and chopped-off compositions to figure out the dimensions of the robot TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin) which makes him seem all the more otherworldly as both a character and a piece of technology. Actually many of the things that make Nolan a sub-par action director also make him an engrossing pop storyteller; inconsistency might kill a chase scene but it works like gangbusters when it comes to composing a plot twist.In Interstellar he has something of an advantage in that his usual problems with space and time--the question of how long Bruce Wayne spends in that prison and how the hell he gets back to Gotham--are woven into the narrative; here the characters travel through a literal plot hole. This produces some of the most graceful moments of Nolans career like the seamless initial transition from Coops perspective to the perspective of the grown-up Murph (Jessica Chastain). However as in many of the directors works the cross-cutting grows heavier and more frenetic as the movie goes on; the early Earth-set scenes are almost atypically straightforward but by the time-bending climax it begins to feel as though the movie will collapse under the weight of all of its parallel lines. Throughout Zimmers music with its ascending organ figures begs rapture and every now and then the movies effects team manages to pull together an imaginative moment like the one where space seems to crawl out from under a spacecraft as it slides into the wormhole.Though Nolan--who penned the script with his brother and frequent collaborator Jonathan--has a knack for self-contained turns of phrase (""Mankind was born on Earth but it was never meant to die here"" is this movies ""the hero Gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now"") hes never been much of a dialogue writer or director. The best back-and-forths in his movies--like the various behind-the-scenes reveals in The Prestige--are essentially cut-up monologues interspersed with questions and delivered in tantalizing chunks. With the exception of McConaughey Irwin and Matt Damon--who has a focused turn as one of the scientists sent ahead of the main team--every actor is given whats essentially a thankless role tasked with behavior and expository dialogue that ranges from impersonal to downright dumb like the scene in which Romilly explains to Coop what a wormhole is--using the exact same pen and paper trick as Event Horizon--just as theyre about to finally fly into one.Still despite--or perhaps because of--its flaws Interstellar manages to convey something of the spirit of sci-fi literature thats usually missing from film. Its ungainliness and inelegance speaks to an enthusiasm that can become engrossing in and of itself; its crazy about the silence of space the mechanics of long-term space travel and all of the other little things sci-fi movies usually streamline out. Considering that both the teams away missions--which find them descending on to unfamiliar planets to investigate the scientists signals--and the Earth scenes could function as self-contained twisty short stories its almost easier to think of the film as an anthology of sci-fi tales with the relationship between Coop and Murph serving as the underwhelming two-part wraparound.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details not talked about in this review visit Interstellars spoiler space.

(Paramount Pictures) By Ann Hornaday November 4 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Say this much for ""Interstellar"" It takes muchness to a new level. Ask a handful of viewers what they think of Christopher Nolans science-fiction adventure story -- starring a perfectly cast Matthew McConaughey as a space cowboy blessed with equal parts swagger and shamanistic depth -- and they will rightfully wonder which movie youre referring to The outer-space epic that tries mightily to give such precursors as ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Gravity"" a run for their O-rings in sheer scale and ambition? The provocative sometimes ponderous meditation on environmental ruin intellectual freedom and the demise of manifest destiny? The mawkish daddy-needs-to-save-the-world-now melodrama? The pulverizing near-constant sonic boom of the sound design modulated by periods of haunting airless silence? ""Interstellar"" is all these things -- and more when you throw in a couple of goofy exercises in stunt casting. Nolan who brought such grandiosity and sanctimonious self-seriousness to the ""Batman"" franchise and whose densely layered metaphysical puzzle ""Inception"" is surely still being debated in living rooms throughout the world once again has made a movie that wants to be taken more seriously than mere spectacle or sensory mind-body trip. Hes out to overwhelm crush and otherwise immobilize an audience already saturated with 3-D extravaganzas and narcotized by computer-generated hoo-hah. True to his artistic convictions Nolan has filmed ""Interstellar"" on IMAX film stock proudly planting the flag once more for a format that like the Earth at the center of the story is careening toward extinction. Its a praiseworthy mission and there are moments of genuine awe and majesty in ""Interstellar"" but there are just as many passages that play as if Nolan is less interested in value for the viewers than proving a point whether about the arcana of quantum physics his technical prowess or the enduring power of love. Which isnt to say theres not much to value in a film that begins in the wide open spaces of a modern-day Dust Bowl and ventures to galaxies far far away. In an Andrew Wyeth-inspired farmhouse in the middle of a vast cornfield a former test pilot named Cooper (McConaughey) lives in the not-too-distant future with his two kids and father-in-law (John Lithgow) the world outside rapidly shriveling into agricultural collapse. With food so scarce all social and economic resources have turned from technological innovation and space exploration in favor of farming. ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder about our place in the stars"" Coop says mournfully over his beer bottle. ""Now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dirt."" That changes when Coop and his beloved daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) discover a mysterious code that leads to equally mysterious coordinates out in the countryside. Soon enough Coop has been enlisted on a top-secret probably deadly mission to find a habitable planet outside the solar system and hes cramming into a craft alongside three other astronauts willing to risk their lives to save humanity. One of those scientists is played by Anne Hathaway whose molten-brown eyes seem always on the verge of tears as the crew rattles its way through black holes and worm holes and star stuff (oh my). Nolan stages their journey with impressive even thrilling verisimilitude juxtaposing the deafening rattle and thrum inside the rocket with the eerily quiet world just outside. And he brings just as much imaginative vision to the places they eventually discover from the enormous terrifying wave that threatens to engulf them on one watery planet to the tundra-like expanse of another. Oddly enough when the end of the world is near only the developed West will see fit to respond ""Interstellar"" is a remarkably monocultural affair up to and including the British accents of co-stars David Gyasi and Michael Caine who intones Dylan Thomas with wearying obviousness throughout the production. With his Chuck Yeager-worthy drawl and reflectiveness well honed from his Lincoln commercials McConaughey makes for a compelling even believable hero who is saddled with guilt over leaving his kids at home perhaps never to return. (He breaks down with particularly convincing abandon when he receives a pivotal video missive from home.) But too often the father-daughter dynamics that propel ""Interstellar"" -- which Nolan co-wrote with his brother Jonathan -- feel shrewdly calculated the emotionalism ginned up to a hysterically maudlin pitch. Once Cooper and his colleagues cross back and forth between the space-time continuum ""Interstellar"" falls into the talky trap with the filmmaker trying to overcome plodding drearily explanatory passages with Hans Zimmers basso profundo organ-music score and pummeling sound effects. (One of ""Interstellars"" producers is the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne whose research undergirds many of the films most fascinating ideas about time and gravity.) With the exception of a sympathetic computer named TARS -- wittily voiced by Bill Irwin -- theres precious little humor in ""Interstellar"" unless you count a surprise cameo that conjures visions of the Hollywood satire ""The Player"" in its absurd bid for an entirely different brand of star stuff. By the time Cooper realizes his rightful place in the grand cosmic soup -- with the help of a scientist back home played by Jessica Chastain -- the endgame becomes a protracted demand for tears that for many viewers will feel like distant Earth-bound artifacts themselves. ""Interstellar"" tries so hard to be so many things that it winds up shrinking into itself much like one of the collapsed stars Coop hurtles past on his way to new worlds. For a movie about transcending all manner of dimensions ""Interstellar"" ultimately falls surprisingly flat. Interstellar   (168 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong profanity. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Review Interstellar skillfully explores outer and inner spaces - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Interstellar explores outer and inner spaces Interstellar movie review by Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Kenneth Turan reviews ""Interstellar."" Starring Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. (Video by Jason H. Neubert). Los Angeles Times Film Critic Kenneth Turan reviews ""Interstellar."" Starring Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. (Video by Jason H. Neubert). Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Christopher Nolans Interstellar sends Matthew McConaughey on a mission to save humans if not the Earth Memorable science fiction thinks the unthinkable so we dont have to.If earlier generations fretted about nuclear radiation or alien invasion what powers Christopher Nolans altogether remarkable ""Interstellar"" is an up-to-date concern about the continued viability of a degraded planet Earth as home for the human race. Could it be true that as one character succinctly puts it ""were not meant to save the world were meant to leave it""? Written by director Nolan and his brother Jonathan and starring the powerhouse trio of Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain ""Interstellar"" is a near-future story of an intergalactic search for other planets that might support life in the way weve become accustomed to.But though its a big studio blockbuster with all the traditional plot elements the term implies ""Interstellar"" turns out to be the rarest beast in the Hollywood jungle. Its a mass audience picture thats intelligent as well as epic with a sophisticated script thats as interested in emotional moments as immersive visuals. Which is saying a lot. For especially if seen in 70-millimeter in the IMAX format its director prefers ""Interstellar"" uses old-fashioned film to create some extraordinary images. More than an hour of ""Interstellar"" is shot in IMAX with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema -- who did Spike Jonzes futuristic ""Her"" -- at times carrying the machine on his shoulder he said ""almost like the worlds heaviest GoPro camera."" ""Interstellar"" turns out to be the rarest beast in the Hollywood jungle. Its a mass audience picture thats intelligent as well as epic. -- Kenneth Turan The Nolan brothers script its use of familiar science fiction tropes aside manages to investigate some compelling emotional material. Much less of a B picture dramatically than last years ""Gravity"" its exploration of the ways in which love mendacity and the core nature of humanity are informed by the physical and psychological demands of outer space ensures that this story will stay with you its themes taking permanent residence at the back of your mind.Clocking in at a daunting 2 hours and 49 minutes ""Interstellar"" is also a film that wont be rushed. Its first hour is spent exclusively on Earth as Nolan and company thoroughly ground us in both the characters and the perhaps not-so-distant future world they inhabit. What we see first is a series of filmed oral history interviews as a variety of elderly parties describe their youth spent in the era in which ""Interstellar"" takes place. Its a time of terrible soul-destroying drought (the look was inspired by Dust Bowl imagery from the 1930s) in which famine threatens the entire planet. A blight has killed all wheat and governments heavily encouraged every able-bodied man to become a corn farmer to keep humanity alive.This does not sit well with Cooper -- Coop for short -- played by McConaughey at his most casually charismatic. Hes a widower and former test pilot who dreams of adventure but now lives the desperate agricultural life with his grizzled father-in-law (John Lithgow) and his two children straight arrow Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and 10-year-old Murphy (an animated Mackenzie Foy Bella Swans daughter in the ""Twilight"" finale) whose feistiness and smarts echo those of her old man.Ever the quester Cooper follows a hunch that leads him to a secret underground bunker where a group of government scientists knowing that Earths days are numbered has decided to do something out of the box about it.Having discovered a wormhole near Saturn a shortcut through space and time to a different galaxy the scientists led by the venerable Dr. Brand (Michael Caine in his sixth Nolan film) have launched a series of probes in an attempt to locate another life-supporting planet all the while wondering whether some benevolent force somewhere is helping them out.Three promising locations have been found and yet another interstellar expedition is being mounted to check them out. On the voyage will be Dr. Brands crisp daughter Amelia (Hathaway) two other scientists (played by Wes Bentley and David Gyasi) even a cheeky robot named TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin). The only thing missing is yes an experienced pilot.Even though Cooper is beyond eager to take this on there is a catch. The trip means leaving his family especially a certain very unhappy 10-year-old behind and because of the mind-warping ways time works on flights like this Murphy could possibly have died by the time Cooper returns. If he returns at all.With its talk of wormholes black holes the fifth dimension and the puzzles of space and time ""Interstellars"" script makes full use of the services of one of its executive producers theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. But though some of the scientific specifics can be a bit daunting the broad outlines of the story are always involving (especially when the adult Murphy played by Chastain enters the picture) and never difficult to follow.If the science can get ethereal it is one of the characteristics of a Nolan film that as much as possible of what you see was shot in the camera and created physically not in a computer. In fact two of the films space ships weighing in at more than 10000 pounds each were reassembled on a remote glacier in Iceland that doubles as one of those far-away planets.But ""Interstellars"" greatest accomplishment is that all those logistics didnt stand in the way of the personal dimension of a story that understands that the qualities that make us human is the most special effect of all.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------InterstellarMPAA rating PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 49 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Fiction Christopher Nolan Matthew McConaughey IMAX Interstellar trailer Premiere Interstellar Christopher Nolan explains human touch behind Interstellars feats Fandango to send an Interstellar ticket-buyer to edge of space Interstellar makes some noise at Hollywood coming-out party Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-interstellar-review-20141105-column.html,200,interstellar18,interstellar,latimes

PGEven a cool cat like Christopher Nolan can cough up a furball -- and with his sci-fi adventure Interstellar its blockbuster-sized.For the first time in a stellar filmmaking career that includes Memento Inception and the Batman trilogy one of Nolans grand ideas has failed to achieve liftoff unlike the spacecraft that Matthew McConaughey pilots into the cosmos on a survival quest for a dying Earth.Article Continued BelowMcConaugheys Cooper a Midwest farmer and test pilot sharing both surname and flyboy skills with one of the original NASA astronauts has the misfortune of being caught not only in the time/space/gravity/love vortex of the films multiple dimensions but also the dizzy inanity of a screenplay that whipsaws between John Steinbeck and Stanley Kubrick.Christopher Nolans Interstellar starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway is mostly lost in space.  (Melinda Sue Gordon / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  One minute Cooper is like Tom Joad in an update to Steinbecks The Grapes of Wrath global warming and a pernicious crop blight having turned the entire planet into 1930s Dust Bowl America. The next hes like Dave Bowman in Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey heading beyond the infinite on a mission of discovery and hope with no guarantee of success or survival.The character split is fine in theory as is so much of what Nolan and his co-writer brother Jonathan have crammed into Interstellar which is based on the black hole deductions of theoretical physicists Kip Thorne who gets a producers credit and Stephen Hawking who doesnt. Nolan and bro look fondly back to a time when sweat and pluck conquered the sky and ""it seemed like they made something new every day."" They also gaze with wonder toward a future when mankind can think its way out of planetary calamities and zoom through ""wormholes"" to new worlds.You have to applaud the films respect for the audiences intelligence. It boldly goes with the assumption that dramatizing Einsteins Theory of Relativity makes for more gripping blockbuster entertainment than say watching two of Michael Bays Transformers robots pound the hell out of each other. Regrettably brain doesnt beat brawn here although the eye is frequently treated. There are moments of sheer visual poetry in Interstellar such as when Coopers spacecraft passes through the rings of Saturn or when a giant wave on a newly found water planet threatens to engulf our heroes who also include Anne Hathaways brittle scientist Amelia Brand. At moments like these Nolans eagerly sought comparisons with Kubrick seem justified although the homage gets out of hand -- Hans Zimmers assaultive score too often references the 2001 soundtrack.Interstellar groans from the weight of plot inconsistencies (which are worse than usual for Nolan) and corn that grows as high as an elephants eye both on Coopers farm and in the script.McConaughey Hathaway and their estimable co-stars -- who include Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck as the daughter and son Coop leaves behind John Lithgow as the family patriarch and Michael Caine David Gyasi and Wes Bentley as NASA scientists -- have to struggle with ponderous and jargon-filled dialogue (made worse by a deliberately muddy sound design) that inspires more guffaws than awe.Other times its pure gobbledygook as when a character talks about having to ""construct a three-dimensional space within a five-dimensional reality"" in the rushed third act that strives for an unearned ""love conquers all"" ending.Most troubling of all is the films ingrained sexism. All of the female characters are emotional and erratic often failing to demonstrate the proverbial ""right stuff"" that McConaugheys cool-headed Cooper exudes as easily as he drawls.Interstellar takes us decades into the future and through a wormhole of infinite exploration but when it comes to Hollywoods treatment of women it seems just like old times.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Someday someone might come along and solve the pressing issue of filmmaking hubris.It wont be Christopher Nolan a wildly talented filmmaker who swings from his heels and usually connects (Inception the Dark Knight trilogy). In Interstellar he misses not horribly but badly enough to highlight some of his less fruitful habits. If you want characters gabbing away at explanations of lofty concepts and a pounding musical score that drowns out dialogue then this must be the place.The premise promises wonder and it delivers in fits and starts. The world of the near future is choked by dust storms that make the plains of the 1930s look like an oasis. (Fans of Ken Burns The Dust Bowl miniseries will recognize some talking heads from that project who fill the same purpose here.) Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a former pilot who still dreams of space must instead maintain the family farm to help sustain a dwindling food supply. Then he gets a dream opportunity Travel through a wormhole to another galaxy in hopes of finding a more hospitable planet.Interstellar starts out feeling like Nolans Steven Spielberg homage establishing a foundation of family and loss with a touch of awe looming over the horizon. Spiritual implications nurture the dry terrain. ""Didnt you say science is about how much we dont know?"" asks Coopers young daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy who grows up to become Jessica Chastain). Interstellars time on Earth is rewarding and underplayed with some nifty conceptual touches Murph gets in trouble at school for insisting the Apollo space missions werent just manufactured propaganda designed to bankrupt the Soviets. Distrust of innovation has reached an extreme.Then we head to space courtesy of a top-secret NASA project led by an avuncular professor (Michael Caine). Cooper gets to planet-hop with a crew that includes the professors astronaut daughter (Anne Hathaway). Before long were being speechified into high-concept submission. For every eye-popping marvel including a wormhole for the cinematic ages theres a long winding multicharacter discourse on astrophysics or in the movies more fecund moments the power of love.Interstellar reminded me that a Nolan movie can create the sensation of being trapped in a world with people who insist on telling you how smart they are over and over again.The old adage about showing instead of telling comes to mind. Interstellar shows plenty especially in the 70 mm Imax format. And it tells and tells and tells. Nolan is after nothing less than great cosmic significance. I admire his ambition and audacity. So does he. Imagine Kubricks 2001 populated by characters who wont shut up.The gab has a way of squeezing out that hard-fought sense of wonder until the end when the emotional resonance makes a return. The human core of Interstellar is powered by Coopers bond with his daughter and the gravitational pull of home that goes back to Odysseus. (How does Chastain manage to play the daughter of McConaughey her elder by only eight years? Its all about time and space and Interstellar is happy to explain.)The climax contains some tangled magic. If youre not exhausted by almost three hours of intergalactic lecturing you may even be able to feel it.Interstellar (B-)Directed by Christopher Nolan. PG-13 (some intense perilous action and brief strong language). 169 mins.

The movies mix of family drama and cosmic esoterica doesnt jell. By Peter Rainer Film critic November 4 2014 Save for later Saved About video ads About video ads View Caption of The 25 best science fiction movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide In Christopher Nolans lumbering sci-fi epic ""Interstellar"" starring Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain Earth has become close to unlivable because of a Dust Bowl-like blight. But not to worry There are planets we can colonize. First however we must pass through an intergalactic wormhole. And then theres that pesky Einsteinian problem Those who return to Earth have aged far more slowly than the earthlings who stayed behind. Nolan of the ""Dark Knight"" franchise is attempting to make his very own ""2001"" but the bloom is off that rose. ""Interstellar"" is an unwieldy mix of the dystopian and utopian. McConaughey plays Cooper a former engineer and test pilot recruited by NASA to thread the wormhole leaving behind his precocious and immediately resentful 10-year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). While Cooper dallies in deep space Murph played as an adult by Chastain grows into an intimidating scientist who still has major daddy issues. (You want to shake her and say ""Get over it"") Nolan tries to pair the cosmic esoterica with this father-daughter tussle but the mix doesnt jell. Visionary movies require a bigger vision.

"Interstellar | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; interstellar ) Interstellar (United States/United Kingdom 2014) November 04 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Christopher Nolan has never shied away from a challenge and the one he has taken on with Interstellar may be his most prodigious thus far - bigger than delivering an end-to-start chronology in Memento more impressive than the mind-bending contortions of Inception and more daunting than re-imagining Batman into the most unique superhero franchise of the 21st century. Interstellar is simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy breathtaking hopeful and heartbreaking. Its an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Nolan has crafted Interstellar as a movie theater experience. Watching it at home no matter how good the sound system is wont match. This is one time when the IMAX surcharge is worth it. Interstellar is science fiction. Its not space opera. Its not futuristic fantasy. Its what the term ""science fiction"" was coined to represent. It presents a viable future in which space travel while possible is dangerous and uncertain. Starships arent zipping from planet to planet. Space craft arent firing lasers phasers or photon torpedoes. Travel across long distances uses the dangerous and unpredictable method of entering a wormhole not engaging Warp One or making the jump to hyperspace. Time dilation comes into effect in the presence of a black hole and theres even a little bit about the relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity. This isnt Star Wars Star Trek or Guardians of the Galaxy and anyone who approaches it with such expectations will be disappointed. Its more along the lines of recent movies like Contact (which also starred Matthew McConaughey) and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the rules of reality as we understand them. It will be difficult to find a review of Interstellar that doesnt reference 2001 A Space Odyssey and theres a valid reason for that. Nolan at times uses Stanley Kubricks masterpiece as a template especially during moments of grandeur. Hans Zimmers score is no less crucial to Interstellar than ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" was to 2001. Yet this is no mere copy of Kubricks film; in fact it goes far afield. Theres heroism a la The Right Stuff. Its also a warmer more emotional experience - less stately and abstruse. In fact found at the core of this big budget adventure is the most relatable thing imaginable the feelings of love and trust that bind father and daughter. Its almost a fusion of Kubrick and Spielberg. Interstellar opens at an unspecified future date in Americas farm belt. Although the film is careful not to identify a year its probably around 2050. The world has fallen victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killing crops and creating massive dust storms. With nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere total asphyxiation is the inevitable endgame. Earth as a bastion of humanity is doomed. Former NASA engineer and test pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) owns acres of corn that he farms along with his family son Tom daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Drawn by almost supernatural means to a chain-link fence around a super-secret location Cooper finds himself face-to-face with what remains of his former employer an underground think-tank dedicated to saving the human race. Led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) NASA has developed two plans. The first involves creating a massive space vehicle to transport as many humans as possible into outer space. The second involves using frozen embryos to colonize a distant world. There are problems with Plan A - namely overcoming gravity to launch the massive space ship - but Brand is convinced he can solve the necessary equations that will make this possible. Cooper learns that a wormhole has appeared in space near Saturn presumably placed there by (alien) entities of great intelligence intent upon giving humanity a path of survival. Ten years ago astronauts were sent through to scout the dozen potentially habitable planets on the other side. Now another craft must make the journey to determine humankinds final destination. Mindful that his childrens future is at stake Cooper agrees to pilot the craft. He is accompanied by a small crew of four Brands daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the sardonic robot TARS (Bill Irwin) who recalls HAL 9000. Murph is resentful of her father for abandoning her - an anger she nurses into adulthood when (now played by Jessica Chastain) she becomes Brands second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her. Like Contact Interstellar displays an uncanny knack for making complex physics accessible to laymen (partial credit to Executive Producer and CalTech physicist Kip Thorne). Yes there are times when the dialogue is dense but it never becomes impenetrable (although there are some odd passages such as one in which Cooper and Amelia discuss the meaning of ""love""). Does the movie occasionally fudge? Of course but it sticks closer to Einsteins laws than most space-faring movies and when it speculates it does so in a believable manner. The movie remains Earthbound for its first 45 minutes establishing a dire scenario for the planet and depicting the day-to-day struggles of those who survive in this blasted inhospitable future. Most importantly however this part of the film establishes the closeness of the relationship between Cooper and Murph and introduces the mystery of ""them"" - the mysterious ""ghosts"" who will play a part on the periphery for the rest of the movie. In the end Cooper must embrace the philosophy that ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" He promises to Murph that he will return knowing he may not be able to keep that promise. Once in space the white knuckle moments begin. Limiting the use of CGI Nolan relies on practical effects to craft a movie that feels more like a real journey than a video game. There are some tremendous action set pieces and the narrative is wonderfully unpredictable. The movie takes some chances with its endgame which resolves a lot of plot points but at times seems rushed. Interstellar is at its most complex during its final 20 minutes and even those who pay rapt attention may leave the theater with some unanswered questions. The film is nearly three hours but theres enough story here for something a lot longer. In condensing it Nolan has made something 169 minutes in length that breezes by faster than many productions half its length. He accomplishes this by establishing a blistering pace during Interstellars meatier sections including expert cross-cutting between Earth and space during a powerful ""fire and ice"" sequence. Visually Interstellar looks great. Nolan understands all the facets of special effects technology (except perhaps old age makeup) and uses them to their best. Hans Zimmer delivers an operatic score that although occasionally drowning out dialogue (more a mixing issue than a scoring one) adds to the overall experience. Sound is important to Interstellar - when the rocket lifts off around the 45-minute mark the bass shakes the entire theater. It has been a tremendous year for McConaughey. From Dallas Buyers Club to True Detective to Interstellar he has won a Golden Globe and an Oscar and been nominated for an Emmy. Interstellar will give him another opportunity for Academy recognition hes the glue that holds everything together. Hes the human factor in a vast universe. His love for his daughter and his pain when he acknowledges her despair invests this movie with a warmth and feeling that no previous Nolan movie can boast. The supporting cast which includes Anne Hathaway Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine is strong but McConaughey represents the heart and soul of Interstellar. For those who appreciate the Mobius strip approach Nolan is known for Interstellar offers a little of that. There are some twists and non-chronological jumps although not so many that the story becomes confusing or unintelligible. Time dilation (the slowing down of time for those in close proximity to a dense gravitational source) isnt just a convenient plot device; its an integral element of the narrative. Like nearly everything else in Interstellar it is used effectively. For anyone with a hunger for real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing watered-down version Hollywood typically offers (and that I often enjoy immensely) Interstellar is a satisfying entree. Id rank this alongside Memento and The Dark Knight as the best Nolan has done and its an immediate contender for one of 2014s best. The film deserves the label of an ""experience"" and the bigger the venue the more immersive it will be. As event movies go this is one of the most unique and mesmerizing.

"Interstellar review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Interstellar Interstellar a visual marvel in which pros outweigh cons Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and Tribune entertainment reporter Christopher Borrelli review Christopher Nolans space epic ""Interstellar."" Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and Tribune entertainment reporter Christopher Borrelli review Christopher Nolans space epic ""Interstellar."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Time keeps on slipping slipping slipping in Christopher Nolans mind-scrambler starring Matthew McConaughey A knockout one minute a punch-drunk crazy film the next ""Interstellar"" is a highly stimulating mess. Emotionally its also a mess and thats what makes it worth its 165 minutes -- minutes made possible by co-writer and director Christopher Nolans prior global success with his brooding increasingly nasty ""Batman"" films and with the commercially viable head-trip that was ""Inception.""You can call ""Interstellar"" corny or reiterative or just plain daunting and youd be right. It is those things. It is hobbled by astronomy and physics seminars disguised as dialogue. But even with its vividly realized imaginings of journeys through a worm hole or its depiction of the largest tidal wave in the history of water what I remembered first the following morning was this Matthew McConaugheys character crying his eyes out as he watches years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth. Simple elemental human feeling. More directors should try it sometime. Co-written by Jonathan Nolan Christophers brother the film is caked with the dust of death and bereavement yet it posits that love is stronger than gravity relativity and even ordinary blockbuster imperatives. ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" may be the directors touchstone but Nolans own galaxy quest is as warm and fuzzy as Stanley Kubricks vision was stoically indifferent to the plight of humankind.The starting point is conventional enough. Were on a farm somewhere in America (played by locations in Alberta -- apparently the Canadian tax breaks never end). The only crop is corn and the so-called ""blight"" has ravaged the global food supply. The planets time is nearly up. McConaughey plays Cooper a frustrated farmer trained as a test pilot who lives with daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow whose stage-trained diction makes the naturalistic McConaughey drawl all the more pronounced). One of the upstairs bedrooms lined with bookshelves appears to be haunted by benign book-tossing ghosts. Surely theres an explanation. One night somewhere near their homestead Cooper and Murph stumble onto the secret underground location of whats left of NASA where a project headed up by the eminent Prof. Brand (Michael Caine Nolans go-to purveyor of mellow wisdom) intends to find a home for Earths inhabitants before the clock runs out. Cooper qualifies as the right flyboy for this crucial space exploration mission. Destination a wormhole near Saturn. On the other end of the wormhole what? A new home? A new set of troubles?The first really good scene in ""Interstellar"" reminds us that Nolan can pull off dramatically flamboyant tricks in style. Cooper will be lost in space for years maybe forever. His kids especially Murph dont want him to go. He does though to try to save the planet. The farewell on the farm is an anguished one and cleverly pushing the time-acceleration idea Nolan intercuts it with the countdown and liftoff of the spaceship helmed by Cooper. His fellow adventurers include Brands daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) the tremulous astrophysicist Romilly (David Gyasi) the snappish scientist Doyle (Wes Bentley) and two geometric widget-y robots voiced by Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. Christopher Nolan injects his sci-fi with soul Christopher Borrelli Near the end of Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar"" as this vast science fiction blockbuster-to-be neared its third hour the floodgates burst My chin quivered (check) tear ducts filled (check) cheeks grew warmer (check). And yup I cried. Sneaking a peek behind myself film publicists cried... Near the end of Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar"" as this vast science fiction blockbuster-to-be neared its third hour the floodgates burst My chin quivered (check) tear ducts filled (check) cheeks grew warmer (check). And yup I cried. Sneaking a peek behind myself film publicists cried... (Christopher Borrelli) The film takes the time and the narrative space to explore several worlds. One is wet dominated by inhospitably crushing mountain-sized ocean waves; another is pure ice where even the clouds above are snow chunks. In one of the scripts more usefully provocative notions time on the water-logged planet proceeds at seven years per human hour. I love this bit; its instantly graspable and frightening cutting to the heart of Nolans obsession with time lost time spent and misspent. This goes back to ""Memento"" a fleet-footed brain-scrambler from the other end of the wormhole of this filmmakers career.Every temporal aspect of existence bends and twists in ""Interstellar."" Theres not much room for the usual conflict and resolution and for a daring portion of the film Nolan manages to make a sincere science-fiction epic without an antagonist only a tangle of conflicting intentions. As adults Coopers children are played by Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck and as they age back on Earth Cooper wonders if he did the right thing leaving them (not really a moral dilemma -- the fate of the planets hanging in the balance) or if hell ever see them again. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. How these questions are answered in the films final 45 minutes will likely toss half of any given audience right off the bus. I sympathize. Yet I found myself hanging on through the films several endings and even the endings beyond those endings. This is a movie unabashedly earnest in its intention to awe. Its certainly the first science-fiction film to combine relativity theory with a line about burying grandpa ""out in the back 40."" The Nolan brothers screenplay asks only that we the awed or the partly awed and partly confused embrace family and our time on Earth or wherever we end up. Its the same plea made by writers as diverse as Charles Dickens and Thornton Wilder. While I devoutly wish Nolan had sent composer Hans Zimmer and his droning thundering score into deep space Im glad we live in a world where a fabulously successful director can retain his ambition even at the expense of clarity.Sixty-six minutes of ""Interstellar"" were filmed with 70 millimeter Imax cameras; all of it was filmed on celluloid as opposed to digitally and the visual results carry a rougher grainier quality than you typically see in space epics. The same is true of the movies most nakedly expressive scenes which have nothing to do with how special the effects are (and theyre pretty special). When McConaughey breaks down watching years-old messages from his son he weeps. And even Zimmers music backs down allowing the scene to breathe play out and -- like the best of this crazy mixed-up heartfelt endeavor -- matter.""Interstellar"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for some intense perilous action and brief strong language)Running time 245 Opens Tuesday eveningmjphillipstribune.com Twitter phillipstribune Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Science Fiction (Movie Genre) Space Exploration Space Christopher Nolan Interstellar Matthew McConaughey Interstellar (Trailer) Movies to see between now and New Years Interstellar Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-interstellar-20141104-column.html,200,interstellar24,interstellar,chicagotribune

Christopher Nolan wants us to think big. As in big ideas on a big screen.In ""Interstellar"" the director exhorts humanity to aim for the stars -- literally. And he makes his sales pitch for investing in wonder with a spectacular presentation that would be wasted on a TV tablet or smartphone. This is epic cinema that begs to be compared to ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" But unlike Stanley Kubricks psychedelic joyride this journey is powered by a human heart.The heart belongs to Matthew McConaughey. Making a rare detour into dad mode he plays Cooper a former astronaut who is now a farmer and the widowed father of two kids. Although the setting seems like the present day in the Midwest we surmise that the U.S. has suffered some kind of calamity that has shrunk the population and left the landscape parched with dust. The heavy-handed officials at his kids school deem that college-eligible Tom (Timothee Chalamet) would be more useful to society as a farmer than an engineer and they chide 10-year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy outstanding) for her impractical interest in space flight.But Murph feels that forces are pulling her skyward and when she insists that the dust in the house is a kind of code Cooper deciphers it as binary directions to a secret facility.Behind tight security the last of NASAs true believers are planning a mission to find a new home for the human race. Professor Brand (Michael Caine natch) believes that Cooper has the right stuff to pilot the spacecraft on a decades-long trek to infinity and beyond.Because of relativity Cooper knows that even if he returns safely his daughter may grow older than him. His tearful goodbye with resentful Murph frames the philosophical question that will be repeated throughout the film whether personal loyalties outweigh the communal good. Cooper rockets into deep space with a crew that includes Amelia (Anne Hathaway) Doyle (Wes Bentley) Romilly (David Gyasi) and a blocky robot called TARS that is dubiously programmed with a human personality (voice of Bill Irwin). Ahead of them is a wormhole that leads to either a nearby planet that can be touted to the Earthlings or a distant planet where Cooper will run out of fuel and hatch a cargo of embryos.From the script to the acting to the production design ""Interstellar"" is so airtight that when co-pilot Amelia advises Cooper to be guided by love it sounds plausible.Notwithstanding the cosmological conundrums (and the occasional allusions to ""The Wizard of Oz"") this is a crackerjack action movie. Its a rare space opera that includes both a killer wave (where the one-vs.-many dilemma is played out) and a frozen cloud (where an uncredited Famous Actor tries to derail the mission). Meanwhile Murph grows into an adult scientist (played by Jessica Chastain) who works with Professor Brand to interpret the data coming back from space for signs that her father is still alive.Like ""2001"" ""Interstellar"" hits the reverse thrusters when it tries to literalize concepts such as extra-dimensional time travel which allows Cooper to peek into Murphs life from behind a bookshelf. But the sheer audacious scale of the film and its ideas overwhelm any reservations about taking the long trip. Because most movie buffs will never travel into space ""Interstellar"" is our ticket to heaven.What ""Interstellar""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 249  Content Some intense perilous action and brief strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Unfortunately his focus is more about intergalactic travel and wormholes than intriguing human relationships. |  out of 4 stars November 4 2014 -- 417pm Melinda Sue Gordon Mct - Mct Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway in ""Interstellar"" from Paramount Pictures and Warner Brothers Entertainment. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Call it the M. Night Shyamalan syndrome. A director begins his career with triumphant early films then something snaps. Tim Burton Ridley Scott Jason Reitman and many more decline as their command of excitement fades. It makes you hope that the disappointing ""Interstellar"" is just a temporary downfall in Christopher Nolans legendary film catalog not the start of a hefty deterioration. Written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan its a three-hour effort to create an important epic film. Unfortunately his focus is more about intergalactic travel and wormholes than intriguing human relationships. If your interest in prolonged discussions of the space-time continuum fades composer Hans Zimmer will boost the already booming organ soundtrack up to 12. The plot set in a melodramatic near future introduces Matthew McConaughey as Cooper a widowed former ace pilot turned like most Americans to subsistence farming. A crop plague -- ""the blight"" -- has killed wheat okra every food but corn. Now nourishment is more prized than technological expertise. Tornado-speed dust storms regularly knock books off the Cooper clans shelf. Coopers grade-school daughter Murph (played as a child by ""Twilight"" saga moppet Mackenzie Foy) thinks the phenomenon means spirits are trying to communicate with her. Since Nolan films favor O. Henry-style surprise endings dont condemn her guess too quickly. Murphs active imagination causes her problems in school where teachers now claim that U.S. moon landings were faked. The little girl as bright and inquisitive as her father hasnt much of a future in a society that disrespects logical inquiry and high-tech skills. After 40 grim minutes of hard time on the farm Cooper and Murph come closer to home. They discover a nearby government research center that needs new blood just like them. Michael Caine is the areas NASA research head. Anne Hathaway is his daughter preparing for a final space voyage seeking planets to host a human colony. They recruit Cooper to pilot the trip which will keep him away for generations at the least. As the NASA types point out repeatedly space journeys at the speed of light maintain the travelers youth while poor old Earth continues to age on standard time. Try explaining that to your disconsolate 12-year-old girl as you leave her behind. Paramount Pictures Jessica Chastain plays Matthew McConaugheys daughter as an adult in ""Interstellar."" As the film moves through its next two hours it shifts from the life-or-death challenges facing the team on the black edge of space and Coopers fading farm community. Murph (played as an adult by Jessica Chastain) faces challenging assignments in the nearby NASA base and apocalyptic fires near the old farm. The film jumps between Earth and space events repeatedly an odd choice because theres a huge light year of time disconnection between them. To remind us how really truly important every malady is Caine repeatedly recites ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" which Dylan Thomas surely composed while thinking of hard-luck astronauts. The longer the film runs the more forehead-slapping it becomes. The space crew visit planets one water-drowned one ice-crippled where it looks like corn would never grow happily. Another astronaut appears in mid-exploration just as stowaways used to pop into corny space stories from the 1950s. Cooper sentimentally declares in classic Nolan-speak ""Maybe weve spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory. Love is the one thing that transcends time and space."" Because of that a metaphysical miracle occurs. In Get Out of Jail Free manner the film allows a sort of reunion between one of the space travelers and someone who remains back in fire-engulfed Earth. In this science-minded story there is a lot of pseudo-mysticism. Do you think that sounds odd? I have not even mentioned the bizarre robot staff that accompanies the NASA spaceships faceless ghosts in the machine that look like giant gray Lego blocks and talk like wiseguy humans. ""Interstellar"" exposes some of Nolans admirable strengths. It tackles extra-peculiar story matter ignores conventional genres gives moments of danger impeccable visual attention. But unlike his superior ""Inception"" and ""The Dark Knight"" ""Interstellar"" doesnt turn tragedy into rich drama. Like its future Earth its underpopulated. Its focus isnt on the challenging relations between adults who debate scientific theories but on the mawkish connection between the old and the young. The writing is less good than the direction which is less good than the best performances which are less good than the technological polish. Just as ""Interstellar"" is less good than every earlier Nolan release. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Juggling the ricocheting notions of the theory of relativity the metaphysical meditations of 2001 A Space Odyssey the symphonic connectivity of The Tree of Life and the Dust Bowl doom of The Grapes of Wrath and filming it with a giant Imax camera - Nolans Interstellar is a feat not to be taken lightly. But the director who already has probed the honeycombs of the inner universe in his low-budget memory mystery Memento and his high-budget dream-world thriller Inception gets lost somewhere out there on the space-time continuum - his lofty queries about quantum physics and the human spirit weighed down in sci-fi cliches in default-mode dialogue and in characters (especially the women) rendered in two dimensions never mind the fourth and fifth dimensions everyone is talking about. Our story begins on planet Earth in the not-too-distant future. Food supplies have diminished drastically. Decades of environmental recklessness have made vast swaths of the globe uninhabitable. But somewhere in the Plains states a farmer named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) continues to grow corn a still-viable crop and raise a family Murph a ""bright spark"" of a 10-year-old (played with requisite luminosity by Mackenzie Foy) and a son Tom (Timothee Chalamet). His wife is dead but her father Donald (John Lithgow) also lives on the family farm reminding Cooper when he has a teacher conference reminding the kids what their mother was like. Young Murph is convinced a ghost is in the house The books on the bookshelf move objects quiver. Cooper wasnt always a farmer. In fact he was a NASA pilot. When he and Murph accidentally stumble on a government facility (Was it really accidental? were asked to ponder) he gets recruited for a top-secret mission. ""Youre the best pilot weve ever had"" Professor Brand (Michael Caine Nolans go-to talisman) tells him. Cooper he says needs to lead the crew - Anne Hathaway David Gyasi Wes Bentley and a sentient robot (the voice of Bill Irwin) - about to launch straight at a wormhole near Saturn. On the other side of this intergalactic tunnel three planets that may prove viable for humankind. Our time on Earth is about to expire. Interstellar doesnt expire for two hours and 49 minutes. But the Endurance the NASA ship set to rocket to that final frontier has a two-year trajectory. Time is a tricky thing - just ask your dog who is seven times older (or younger?) than you are. Or ask Cooper when he and Hathaways Amelia Brand (yes the professors daughter) plot the most expeditious exploratory landing they can manage. For every hour they dawdle on one of these new planets seven years will have passed back on Earth. Interstellar with its black holes and gravitational anomalies is full of head-scratching math. Back on Earth Jessica Chastain does most of the head-scratching running around the NASA HQ scribbling notations emitting the same urgent vibe she had as the CIA officer hunting down Osama bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty. Casey Affleck also figures into Nolans equation. Chastain and Afflecks characters are byproducts of a screenplay that travels through a meteor storm of theoretical physics. Dylan Thomas also is prominent Caines old professor sad-eyed and saddled with the job of saving humanity spouts a few lines of the Welsh poets defiant ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night."" (""Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage rage against the dying of the light"" and so on.) The incantations echo through the soundtrack along with composer Hans Zimmers surging pipe organ. Interstellar is an experience. Nolans vision of our galaxy and galaxies beyond is daunting majestic; the hardware of space travel looks right almost familiar. And like his Dark Knight trilogy this is something to behold on a big screen - as big as you can get. Its only when he (and cowriting sibling Jonathan Nolan) try to give stature to the humans aboard the Endurance or scrambling frantically back on terra firma that the pieces begin to get out of whack. And ultimately kind of wacky too. MOVIE REVIEW Interstellar  (out of four stars) Directed by Christopher Nolan.

Related links Interview Christopher Nolan wanted to get facts straight By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 835pm on Wednesday Nov. 05 2014 Wednesday Nov. 05 2014 Friday Nov. 07 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The spirit of 2001 A Space Odyssey surrounds Interstellar like a cloud.Director Christopher Nolan who made dreams real in Inception and nightmares come to life in The Dark Knight has acknowledged in interviews his debt to Stanley Kubricks 46-year-old science-fiction classic about man propelled to the distant reaches of the universe. Yet whereas 2001 is enigmatic and ethereal a film that demands to be seen more than once Interstellar is far more prosaic and pedestrian over its near three-hour run time.Still it has moments of bombastic brilliance an often moving performance from Matthew McConaughey and boy at its best is it something to look at.Set on a near-future Earth where nitrogen is spiking in the atmosphere while oxygen is declining McConaughey is Cooper a former pilot turned farmer whos tilling tough soil. A global crop failure has left mankind with only one vegetable -- corn -- that is sure to grow but that certainly wont last much longer. Huge dust storms are a regular occurrence and its obvious that time is ticking down for our form of life on this planet.Even though science has been discredited in this future age -- the world needs more farmers and fewer engineers were told -- NASA has been maintaining a secret bunker with the idea of sending a mission through a recently discovered black hole near Saturn to explore the idea of airlifting mankind to a galaxy far far away.Heading up whats left of NASA are Professor Brand (Michael Caine) his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and scientist Romilly (David Gyasi) and all they need is a good pilot to get them there. Thats where Cooper comes in but hes reluctant to leave his daughter (Mackenzie Foy) and son (Timothee Chalamet) until hes convinced its the only way to save them. Interstellar feels decidedly Earthbound early on -- it picks up once the crew is in space. When McConaughey awakes from hibernation to see the theory of relativity at work -- though he hasnt aged at all he has years worth of video messages from his children and he watches them grow into adults (played by Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck) right before his eyes -- its one of Interstellars magical moments. The only special effect is that of a father realizing how much he has missed his children.Written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan with a special assist from theoretical physicist Kip Thorne Interstellar deals in heady scientific theories that are difficult to comprehend. This is compounded by the sound mix where conversations are sometimes submerged. But that doesnt get in the way of comprehending Interstellars ultimate rather simplistic point which is that love is really all we need.The lackluster dialog throws into stark relief the use of Dylan Thomas passionate poem Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night as spoken by Professor Brand as an anthem for mankinds refusal to surrender to certain death (""Rage rage against the dying of the light""). That bit of poetry is echoed in the visual effects -- whether its a ship breaking up in space a monster wave on a planet of water or Cooper plummeting into a black hole -- that are often head-spinning and dazzling.Hans Zimmers haunting score adds to the sense of wonder and grace. And the physical depiction of robotics -- these robots are far cries from both HAL and R2-D2 -- is unique and ingenious. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema ( Her) has rendered this world in strokes both bold and beautiful. If life is about the journey and not the destination then Interstellar is one heck of a trip.Yet no matter the adventures all travels do end somewhere. Its just unfortunate that Interstellar terminates somewhere near the greeting-card aisle of the universe.But oh what things we have seen along the way.

Media San Francisco Chronicle House hunting can be such a pain. Just ask retired space pilot Cooper played by Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey in ""Interstellar."" The news that the Earth is orbiting toward the exit because of a global blight prompts a desperate quest for a new home in Christopher Nolans new film. The countdown has begun toward the end of complex life on Earth. Armies have disbanded and people get along pretty well -- no ""Road"" or ""Walking Dead""-like roving packs of cannibalistic savages -- as they try to believe they can adapt to survive. But a small group of astrophysicists monitoring a wormhole near Saturn knows Earth is dying and Cooper is the only hope of finding a landing spot for the human race. Pretty cool sci-fi setup there but the ""everyone gets along"" part of it should clue viewers in to some of the suspension of disbelief required to make this spaceship land safely. Thats not to say ""Interstellar"" is a letdown exactly. It is after all powered by the prodigious intellect of Nolan (the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy ""Inception"") and contains top-shelf visual effects that will surely make the academys short list. Its depictions of the nuts and bolts of space travel and its imaginative leaps for say the surfaces of new worlds or glimpses beyond event horizons do not disappoint.

Matthew McConaughey has to enter an outer-space wormhole in the science fiction adventure ""Interstellar."" Photo (c) Legendary Pictures Interstellar review A long journey with not enough new places 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Its the landing that the movie doesnt quite stick. ""Interstellar"" to paraphrase Casey Kasem reaches for the stars but keeps its feet on the ground. The lengthy windup to the trek takes place in the endless expanse of farmland that is this realitys America with farmer Cooper his father-in-law (the always fine John Lithgow) son and whip-smart daughter Murph. Coopers special tie with Murph is the films center of gravity and after everything more of its raison detre than even the far-flung space flight. The McConaissance continues as the Oscar-winning actor delivers in scenes with young Mackenzie Foy as the intelligent girl who loves her daddy too much to understand why he has to leave her. While these tableaux are presented in a self-consciously blown-out look apparently rubbed off from recent Nolan collaborator Zack Snyder they still work because of some fine acting. That emotional throughline helps keep the action taut as Cooper fights the clock to fulfill his mission before his crews resources run out and before the theory of relativity ages everyone on Earth -- Murph included -- into oblivion. For the uninitiated the film takes into account Einsteins notion that a person traveling faster than the speed of light experiences time differently than the rest of us (sorry ""Star Wars""); in this case he or she ages at a dramatically slower rate. So even if Coopers mission succeeds will it do so before everyone he ever knew is dust? Several of the space-peril sequences are gripping though not as intensely as those in ""Gravity."" The two most interesting crew members are robot companions brought to life largely by the great Bill Irwin and they are memorable indeed. Unfortunately the film turns on a reveal that seems utterly obvious from the start and employs a deus ex machina that simply never works. This robs the story of potential impact. The film suffers too from that long windup and afterglow (it clocks in objectively at 169 minutes) and several predictable plot points. Despite its many virtues ""Interstellar"" feels as if it doesnt quite hit the target. Michael Ordona is a Los Angeles freelance writer. Twitter michaelordona Interstellar Science fiction drama.

As life on Earth deteriorates from environmental issues a group of explorers and scientists embark on a voyage to find another viable planet. VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 119 p.m. MST November 3 2014Christopher Nolans film about a trip to deep space to find a habitable place for humans to live doesnt always live up to its ambition but then again its ambition is huge.Oscar winners Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway star in director Christopher Nolans latest mind-bending epic ""Interstellar.""(Photo Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsMcConaughey is excellent as a former NASA pilot brought back into service.The Earth is dying; a trip to deep space to find new worlds might be the only hope for survival.The roles for women are not as strong as they could be as happens with some of Nolans movies.Ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats Christopher Nolan for?Nolans ambition exceeds his execution in ""Interstellar"" sometimes by quite a bit. I had the feeling that if I actually understood some of its more out-there theories they would be flawed. (Or not. As I say some were beyond me.)Yet when the film ended I walked out of the theater in stunned silence trying to figure out what I had just seen. Not in a bad way not at all. It was more like drowning in a sea of ideas and finally at the end of the nearly three-hour running time coming up for air and trying to sort them out.How rare an experience is that?Its not a question of good and bad with this movie. Its a question of how willing you are to give yourself to it -- to like the astronauts strapped into a massive rocket aimed at deep space hold on and go for the ride.Related azcentral.coms latest movie reviews | Fall movie guideThe film takes place in a near future in which the Earth is irrevocably broken. The only crops the soil will support are okra and corn and okras on the way out. Its a deceptively familiar-looking world in which Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is raising his children Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy). Coopers wife has died; her father Donald (John Lithgow) lives with them in a broken-down farmhouse. (Nearly everyone is a farmer now.)Cooper was a NASA pilot but the program was shelved when some unnamed catastrophe struck the feeling being that the public wouldnt support science when people dont have enough to eat. There are still schools but theyre different too -- Murph gets in trouble with a teacher for insisting that NASA didnt fake the moon landing for instance.Matthew McConaughey is out to save the human race in ""Interstellar."" (Photo Melinda Sue Gordon AP)One day Murph leaves her window open during one of the frequent dust storms that plague the world. She has always been convinced there is some kind of ghost in her room and now Cooper thinks she might have a point The pattern of dust in the room forms a binary code. These lead Cooper to a surprise -- NASA or whats left of it has gone underground. His old professor Brand (Michael Caine) is in charge of a mission to travel by way of a wormhole near Saturn to three distant planets to see whether previous trips there found signs of life. The Earth is dying maybe after one or two more generations and transporting the population to one of these planets might be the only hope for human life to continue.Of course it means leaving Tom and Murph behind -- the mission even by use of the wormhole (which will speed things up considerably) will take years. Its a grueling decision choosing between his own family and everyone elses. The scenes in which he tries to say goodbye to Murph are especially heartrending (and Foy is excellent).But off he goes with a crew that includes Brands daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) who is also a scientist; a couple of other scientists; and two robots who have had humor and skepticism programmed into their makeup.Here the film dips into heady levels of relativity and time. For instance they have to work fast while visiting one planet; one hour there is equal to seven on Earth. And Tom and Murph and the rest of the planet are waiting.Jessica Chastain by way of some out-there space time and relativity ideas plays Matthew McConaugheys daughter in ""Interstellar."" (Photo Paramount Pictures)The adult Tom (Casey Affleck) and Murph (Jessica Chastain) send video messages but they take years to arrive and Cooper cant respond to them. There is one sequence in which he watches several years worth in one sitting and the toll is devastating. He is missing their lives even as he tries to save them.As with some Nolan movies the roles for women arent as strong as they should be. Hathaway plays a brilliant scientist who makes gooey decisions based on her heart. Chastain fares somewhat better. Murph is now a scientist helping the elder Brand sort out theories of relativity and gravity that could ... hmm. Im not exactly sure.The film is jaw-droppingly beautiful with visions of space and other worlds that seem both fantastic and believable. The ending doesnt live up to what has come before it but this is the kind of film you dont really want to end. In ""Interstellar"" Nolan has created a universe where ultimately the possibilities are endless. At its best the film feels the same way.AZCENTRALInterstellar (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes Reviewsvies/Interstellar_2014Interstellar4 starsDirector Christopher Nolan.Cast Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway Jessica Chastain.Rating PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Photo Melinda Sue Gordon MOVIE REVIEW Interstellar No fault with these stars. Running time 165 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense peril). Tuesday night at the Ziegfeld the Lincoln Square IMAX others. Genius director Christopher Nolan reaches for the stars in ""Interstellar"" -- and delivers a soulful must-see masterpiece one of the most exhilarating film experiences so far this century. Astronauts Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway journey to a distant galaxy on a desperate mission to save humanity in this brainy heartfelt gorgeous and flawlessly acted sci-fi epic -- inspired by ""2001 A Space Odyssey ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind and less likely sources such as ""The Grapes of Wrath. Its the near future 10 years after Earth began turning into a gigantic dust bowl where those who dont starve when crops wither soon face asphyxiation as nitrogen levels gradually rise in the atmosphere. McConaughey is terrific as Coop whos retired from the space program and is a Midwestern corn farmer and widowed dad. His feisty preteen daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is in trouble at school because she challenges a revisionist textbook claiming the moon landing was faked to justify ""wasting precious resources on the space program. Matthew McConaughey leaves his children behind for a decades-long trip into space -- on a mission to save the Earth.Photo Melinda Sue Gordon Coop and Murph soon learn that NASA has gone underground -- and that his former mentor Brand (Michael Caine) wants Coop to go back to work as the commander of a top-secret mission to save Earths population. This requires traveling through a wormhole a space shortcut beyond Jupiter that Brand believes has been placed there by intelligent life. Its a wrenching sacrifice on Coops part -- separating from an angry Murph and her brother for years. By the time hes reached his first stop in space with Brands daughter Amelia (Hathaway) Coop has two decades worth of messages from Earth to play back -- a killer scene. The father-in-law (John Lithgow) whos raised his kids has died Coops son (Casey Affleck) is a father -- and Murph has grown up to become a scientist (now played by a ferociously good Jessica Chastain) working for Brand who fears Dad is lost in space. I dont want to give away too much but the mission requires Coop and his crew to visit forbidding worlds with massive tidal waves and mountains of ice. Theres also a witty talking robot (voiced by Bill Irwin) and a memorable encounter with a character played by an unbilled star who pretty much owns the movie for 20 minutes including an almost unbearably suspenseful docking sequence. Jessica Chastain plays the grown-up version of Coops daughter Murph.Photo Melinda Sue Gordon The twisty plot by Nolan and his brother Jonathan also takes us on a mind-blowing trip inside a black hole that reminds us why the director of ""Inception"" is perhaps the most visionary director working today. Nolan has a deserved reputation for emotionally chilly work but ""Interstellar surprises with a Spielberg-like warmth -- its basically a potent father-daughter love story at heart even as the filmmaker explores ""bigger"" themes like the survival instinct and American exceptionalism. At a time when large-scale filmmaking consists pretty much of movies inspired by comic books young-adult novels and the Bible Nolan still makes wholly original movies that require audiences to pay close attention and think. You may have heard that ""Interstellar has a lot of exposition including what amounts to a crash course on physics. True but youll be rewarded with a sublime trip to the movies if you go with the time-space flow. Bring lots of tissues.

By David Denby Through a wormhole Matthew McConaughey leads a mission to another galaxy in Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar.""   Credit Illustration by Chris B. Murray ""Interstellar"" an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan with whom he co-wrote the screenplay is ardently even fervently incomprehensible a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolans 2010 movie ""Inception"" offered layers of dreaming consciousness each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless--a postmodern machine with many moving parts dedicated to its own workings and little else. In ""Interstellar"" however Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies ""Interstellar"" begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing the oxygen is decreasing and after a worldwide crop failure dust storms coat the Midwest drying out the corn the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole a tunnel in space-time providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond. The commander of an underground nasa outpost Professor Brand (Michael Caine) sends a favored pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) on a mission Cooper and his crew including Brands daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earths billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage with its altered space-time continuum they testily debate one another referring in passing to theories advanced by Albert Einstein Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne. (Thorne a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawkings served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes relativity singularity the fifth dimension The talk is grand. Theres a problem however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style much of this fabulous arcana central to the plot is hard to understand and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production. Nolan who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies must love the dark. In ""Interstellar"" he and the designer Nathan Crowley and the cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema send Coopers ship the Endurance hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black and much of it is stirringly beautiful. Theres no doubting Nolans craft. Throughout ""Interstellar"" the camera remains active pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting--in particular the crews rough-ride stress--is exciting from moment to moment but over all ""Interstellar"" a spectacular redundant puzzle a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin but George Lucass boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubricks impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far far away. Cooper has two children back on Earth and like Leonardo DiCaprios Cobb in ""Inception"" he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover one of the astronauts on the earlier mission was sent in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized hyper-relaxed drawl and Hathaway with short Ph.D. hair is crisp but also angry and passionate and the two stars clash with professional skill. Coopers side of the argument sets up the movies finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family including his daughter Murph who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears she lashes out at him as only Jessica Chastain can lash out for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time where they assure us love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie. The belief that love as much as gravity holds galaxies together may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. ""The Theory of Everything"" tells the story of Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963 when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party he meets Jane (Felicity Jones) who is studying ""arts"" as she says and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create ""one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe."" But an earlier scene in which he races a friend around a field shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall after which he retreats to his room listening over and over to Wagners ""Die Walkure"" an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years but Jane tougher than a British Army officer marries him and keeps him going. The couple went on to have three children. In one scene a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him ""Does your disease affect you know everything?"" Hawking who is still able to speak a little says ""Different system."" The film at its best doesnt mince words or scenes about Hawkings disability. Its also a revelatory portrait of his strength including his surprising gaiety the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie his illness and his productivity are intimately linked. The film is based on Jane Wilde Hawkings 2007 memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen"" which the screenwriter Anthony McCarten and the director James Marsh have made into a physically detailed and touching but all in all rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room barely able to speak has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isnt made clear though how Hawking does his calculations--his work cant be all speculation.) Eddie Redmaynes performance is astonishing as eloquent though in a different way as Daniel Day-Lewiss work in ""My Left Foot."" Day-Lewis playing the Irish artist Christy Brown a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb deployed his left foot a bushy black beard and minimal mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in ""Les Miserables"" who sang in a fine light tenor the tear-stained but upbeat ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" Tall and slender with freckles and a flattened upper lip he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows his mouth a few facial muscles and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawkings intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world. Hawking doesnt discover a unified equation but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (""A Brief History of Time"" has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story ending with Hawkings refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth for reasons that arent explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. Were puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him after twenty-five years of loving marriage to leave the devoted accomplished and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby and dominates him. After one brief outburst Jane doesnt protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? ""The Theory of Everything"" makes a pass at the complexities of love but whats onscreen requires a bit more investigation.

(Melinda Sue Gordon) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday November 3 2014 559 PM Title Interstellar Film Info With Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway. Astronauts go to the cosmos to save Earth. Director Christopher Nolan (249). PG-13 Language peril. Area theaters and IMAX. Halfway through Christopher Nolans thoughtful but ultimately unfulfilling ""Interstellar"" a spacecraft speeds into a wormhole where four astronauts face a series of possible outcomes. The movie could have gone several ways too -- and it is heartbreaking to watch this ambitious story choose the wrong one and get lost in space. The four travelers are led by Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a farmer on a dying Earth who is caring for his teenage son (Timothee Chalamet) 10-year-old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) and father-in-law (John Lithgow). Its not quite 100 years in the future and an environmental ""blight"" -- left vague -- has choked the dusty planet for a decade. The only crop left is corn and soon that and humanity itself will die. When Cooper and young Murphy look for the source of an energy anomaly they come upon a much-downsized NASA led by Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) an aged scientist who was once Coopers instructor. Brand has found a wormhole near Saturn and previously sent 10 now-missing manned crafts into it seeking planets to colonize. Three sent signals back. Cooper Brands scientist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) two fellow astronauts (David Gyasi Wes Bentley) and some clunky robots are sent into the unknown to find the source of the signals. Theres a chance Coopers team may return though the wormholes time-space rift means decades will pass on Earth while they barely age. So Murphy grows up to become a scientist herself as Cooper flying urgently between possible new planets receives dire long-delayed Skype messages he cant reply to. Mackenzie Foy Matthew McConaughey and the corn that is vital for humanity in Interstellar. (Melinda Sue Gordon) Matthew McConaughey ventures far to save humanity in Interstellar. (Melinda Sue Gordon) Anne Hathaway in Interstellar (Melinda Sue Gordon) A lot happens in ""Interstellar"" to say the least. There are black holes big ideas quantum physics and quiet scenes filled with emotion. Some of it is undeniably engrossing and anyone who likes smart sci-fi will appreciate its echoes of ""Forbidden Planet"" ""Silent Running"" and others especially ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" But the film eventually feels like garbled signals sent across cinematic history. The films heart -- basically that love can conquer the infinite -- falls short perhaps because Nolan (""The Dark Knight"" ""Inception"") is one of our smartest filmmakers but not our warmest. The most affecting moments in his previous films were between Bruce Wayne and his butler. Last years ""Gravity"" did a lot of what ""Interstellar"" aims to do and in half the time. Jessica Chastain seeks a solution for the environmentally ravaged Earth in Interstellar. (Melinda Sue Gordon) McConaughey is a solid anchor even as the film abruptly rushes to get Cooper from terra firma to the cosmos as if Nolan looked at his watch and realized he had to get the show on the road. Foy and Jessica Chastain (as the older Murphy) lend subtle depth. But Hathaway strikes a too-wry note and Bentley is so disposable hes like a doomed red-shirted extra on ""Star Trek."" Yet even as ""Interstellar"" becomes a beautiful mess its wannabe-deep impact will hit everyone differently. We need far-reaching artists like Nolan since as they say Earth without art is ""eh."" For all its faults you may still want to go along for the ride.

Photo Credit TNS / Melinda Sue Gordon advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT To save a dying Earth a father leaves his children to find a new home for mankind. BOTTOM LINE Nolans epic is full of grand ideas and spectacular visuals but somehow feels midsized. CAST Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway Jessica Chastain Mackenzie Foy DIRECTOR Christopher Nolan LENGTH 248 ""Interstellar"" Christopher Nolans hyper-ambitious but slightly underwhelming epic begins its story on a dying Earth. Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey is an aeronautical engineer reduced to working as a farmer; John Lithgow plays Donald grandfather of Coopers children who remembers when mankind dreamed big. ""When I was a kid"" he says ""it seemed like they made something new every day."" Nolan the filmmaker behind the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy and ""Inception"" is still dreaming big as his three-hour movie proves. Cooper who boards a spacecraft in search of a new habitable planet could be a stand-in for Nolan a rare visionary in small-thinking Hollywood. As ""Interstellar"" progresses however the filmmakers ambitions seem to get the better of him. advertisement | advertise on newsday Inspired by the work of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (an executive producer) ""Interstellar"" is a quintessential Nolan film filled with Mobius-strip logic and brain-taxing science. Cooper and his traveling team of NASA die-hards -- including Anne Hathaway as the brittle Amelia Brand and a very good David Gyasi as the placid Romilly -- will grapple with shifting notions of space-time while Earth years tick by in seconds. Coopers aging children are Tom (Timothee Chalomet and Casey Affleck) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain). Nolan tells this story with a curious mix of tones and styles. Theres no shortage of spectacle such as a water-covered planet that churns up terrifying mile-high waves. Elsewhere Nolan goes for realism Ships collide and shatter but soundlessly in space. Potentially stunning moments as when one astronaut suddenly ages 23 years are dismissed almost without comment. The pacing and editing (by Nolans longtime colleague Lee Smith) are so remorseless there isnt a single lull in all 168 minutes but the movie also can feel jumbled and rushed. Around the two-hour mark ""Interstellar"" shudders apart like a satellite on re-entry. Minor subplots suck up time characters develop weird motives and the scientifically precise screenplay (written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan) resorts to squishy notions of spirituality and love. ""Interstellar"" deserves credit for aiming for the stars but the hard realities of filmmaking and storytelling pull it right back to Earth.

Entertainment/Paramount Pictures In his florid sci-fi opera Interstellar Christopher Nolan aims for the stars and the upshot is an infinite hoot -- its dumbness oerleaps dimensional space. Its hugely entertaining though. Matthew McConaughey is the pilot turned farmer turned hero-astronaut named (wait for it) Coop whose bond with his nervy redheaded daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy as a girl Jessica Chastain all growed up) is tighter than the insides of an atom perhaps even the key to transcending the law of relativity. It must be transcended because Earth (in an unspecified near future) is parched dust-smothered dying (no reason given -- but why ask why these days?) and mankind needs to find another hospitable planet stat. The mix of wonky physics mysticism and genetically modified corn is so clunky its ... fabulous. Nolan (who wrote the script with his brother Jonathan) clearly wants Interstellar to be a great American epic --A The Grapes of Wrath II The New Vintage. His dust-covered cars and farmhouses evoke the dust bowl of the 30s but the odd personal computer reminds us that people have the technology to do more than huddle like Steinbecks Okies. The problem is that mankind has lost faith in science to the point where Murphs schoolbooks say the Apollo missions of the 20th century were hoaxes to force the Soviets into a bankrupting space race. Coop chafes at the contraction of mankinds horizons (""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt"") but his view of science is limited by whats measurable quantifiable. Its young Murph whos convinced there are forces that cant yet be explained -- among them a ""ghost"" in her book-lined bedroom shes sure is sending coded messages. Related Stories Celebrities Canat Stop Bragging About Seeing Interstellar 15 New Details About Interstellar I doubt Stephen Hawking could make sense of all the loop-de-loops to come but at least Interstellar has a clear emotional through-line. Eventually a professor played by Michael Caine enlists Coop to pilot a spaceship to another galaxy through a wormhole next to Saturn that was put there (he thinks) by benevolent five-dimensional beings. (""This world was never enough for you Coop."") But the prospect of humanity perishing seems abstract beside the reality of leaving the distraught Murph for decades -- or forever. How can he shake her faith in the one thing she knows to be real -- a fathers love? But how can he not go? ""Mankind was born on Earth"" Caine intones as Hans Zimmers music rises. ""It was never meant to die here."" Interstellar is packed with Go For It lines like that. There are about 37 recitations (I lost count) of Dylan Thomass ""Do not go gentle into that good night ... Rage rage against the dying of the light"" As Coops fellow astronaut Anne Hathaway delivers a wet-eyed speech (while the camera slowly dollies in) on the interstellar power of love. Can it be that the heart knows more than the scientific mind? Thats certainly how the film is shaped. Dramatically speaking every decision Coop makes about mankinds future home is dwarfed by his -- and our -- fear of letting Murph down. What gives the movie its urgency is that shes aging more rapidly than he is especially when he lands on a planet where every passing hour equals seven years on Earth. By the end of the three-hour Interstellar you might wonder if 21 years has passed in the outside world too. But the first half at least goes by quickly. Nolans frames are unusually clean (even with all the dust) and the special effects are as convincing as in any NASA documentary. In space the ringed mother ship -- a great segmented wheel -- spins so lyrically that you dont even need the ""Blue Danube"" waltz. Though the wisecracking robot TARS seems a throwback to kiddie sci-fi shows the design is elegant like two mini 2001 monoliths attached in the middle and striding around like Gumby. McConaughey is a good sci-fi hero his stoner-cowboy drawl making even his overexplanatory lines sound flaky and though Hathaway still has the look of a drama-camp kid eager to prove herself theres something dear about her. She has gumption. Foy and Chastain are an excellent tag-team Murph (though Chastain basically recycles her Zero Dark Thirty performance) and Matt Damon pops up on an ice planet to look shifty and bite his lip to keep from breaking into his peerless McConaughey impression. The second half is where the sputtering begins the Nolans being firmly wedded to spatial flips temporal permutations and intricacy for intricacys sake. Theres a flurry of crosscutting between Coop in space and Murph on Earth thats first bewildering and then riotously inane. My hunch is that given their clout no one is permitted to examine the Nolans scripts for what a scientist might term ""massive narrative anomalies."" But the incoherence might be -- paradoxically -- a key to their prized status in certain quadrants of the internet galaxy where billions of words will be devoted to filling in the gaps and figuring out say how to reconcile the characters rates of aging. I wonder if the Nolanoids will even care that what should be the triumphant climactic scientific achievement happens offscreen and that the ending is so goopy it makes you grateful that back in the day Stanley Kubrick opted for arty obscurity. But the movie is still gobs of fun if youre in the right frame of mind. The Nolans ever ambitious even throw in baseball as a symbol for mankinds hopeful past. Interstellar is the new woo-woo touchstone Starfield of Dreams. This article appears in the November 3 2014 issue of New York Magazine. Postscript Christopher Nolans movies are defended so angrily (and with such high levels of abusive) on the internet that I find myself grateful for divergent viewpoints such as this outrageous Esquire U.K. putdown of some of our most beloved cinematic works. I must say that I disagree about the first Matrix movie -- I think it comes closer to the spirit of Philip K. Dick than many Dick adaptations. But its always fun to throw a bit of snark the Nolanoids way.

Its a science-fiction epic. Its a drama about a fathers love. Its a huge piece of special-effects eye-candy. Its a trippy mindbender. Its ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" -- with a heart. (And depending on your point of view that is either the money blurb for the movie poster or a horrendous bit of blasphemy.) But what I truly liked about ""Interstellar"" is that its a Chris Nolan movie -- which means that its not only full of great visuals and big ideas (albeit ones that are sometimes a little confusingly expressed) but that its a movie about human perseverance. ""Memento"" ""The Prestige"" ""Inception"" -- grim as these could seem at first they were still stories about people bravely facing impossible challenges. Even the pitch-black ""Dark Knight"" trilogy is about a man who survives a childhood trauma a lost love even a broken back to not only save a city but carve out a private life for himself. And that stubborn optimism is part of ""Interstellar"" too. Yes its another story of dystopian sci-fi set in a not-too-distant future when the world can no longer feed itself and schools teach lies and call it history. But heres the thing Science didnt cause this problem. And in fact theyre the only ones working on a solution A trip to another galaxy in search of a new Earth. Anne Hathaway takes her own ultimate trip in Interstellar.PARAMOUNT Admittedly this long movie takes a while to get started and the script takes a while to gel. Sometimes thats from willful vagueness not all of which gets cleared up; sometimes its just sloppy writing. (Matthew McConaughey used to be our best and brightest astronaut -- and NASA never knew he was living a days drive away from their new super-secret headquarters?) But eventually McConaughey and his former bosses reconnect and he hears about this new mission from old scientist Michael Caine. Also that his crew will include the scientists equally brilliant daughter played by Anne Hathaway. Really its like a ""Dark Knight"" reunion but with wormholes and black holes and quite a bit of dialogue explaining both. Once the ship takes off though the movie does too. The trip is full of perils (and unexpected ones too; Einsteins theories make for some very dramatic hurdles). And Nolans quirky visual sense gets full play (weve had over 100 years of movie robots and I guarantee youve never seen any like these.) Sometimes things get too dense perhaps. Theres a lot of talk about relativity and the fifth dimension (which is apparently more than just the happy people behind ""Stoned Soul Picnic""). I couldnt follow all of it but as Neil deGrasse Tyson will probably be issuing his own corrections on Twitter at any moment I didnt feel I had to. But the hard science -- and this is very much sci-fi in the Clarke and Asimov tradition -- is also leavened by some real emotion. The wrenching loss of leaving people behind the loneliness of space -- Nolan conveys all of this and sometimes through something as simple as cutting to the utter implacable silence of the universe outside the ships hull. Its at these points when the movie is at its most nakedly effectively emotional -- as when McConaughey watches years of messages from home and sobs uncontrollably or a man woken up from a frozen sleep dissolves into grateful hysteria or the just-the-facts physicist Hathaway makes a tearful case for the dynamic power of love. For a movie meant to be shown in overwhelming IMAX its a film made up of wrenching closeups and intimate moments. N.J.

Its at about the three-quarter point that the movie started to go a little soft for me. By then Nolan (and his co-writer brother Jonathan) have nearly painted themselves into a corner. Their solution requires a huge suspension of disbelief (as well as the films most flagrant sound-and-visual borrowing from ""2001""). I didnt quite buy it honestly; in fact I would have preferred the film followed the path it seemed to be on to a far smaller and more compromised future. But that wouldnt have been Chris Nolans film or ironically why I like his films. Theyre about the survival of not just the species but the individual -- no matter how improbable that existence may sometime seem. As dark as their worlds get they still offer hope. And who at times like these wants less of that? Ratings note The film contains violence and some strong language. Interstellar (PG-13) Paramount (169 min.) Directed by Christopher Nolan. With Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway Jessica Chastain Michael Caine.

Its good for us that he does. Interstellar his sci-fi spectacularama helixed around a father-daughter love story is a gamble like no other in his career. Its his longest film his headiest his most personal. And in its square-peg-in-a-round-wormhole stab at being the weepy motion-picture event of the year its also his sappiest. Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey is Nolans holy grail and Interstellar is crammed with references to it including an homage to both the computer HAL and the black monolith in the form of a talking robot named TARS. But its 2001s scene of an astronaut warmly video-chatting with his little girl (played by Kubricks own 6-year-old) that acts as Nolans emotional keystone. In an unspecified future where Earth has been doomed to extinction ex-pilot and widower Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is asked by a NASA scientist (Michael Caine) to lead a mission through a cosmic rip in our solar system to search for new planets. His adolescent daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy)--whos been observing ghostly signs in her bedroom including a Morse code message on her bookshelf that spells ""STAY""--pleads with her dad to do just that. But in a film that runs almost three hours Nolan devotes mere seconds to Coopers decision to abandon his family. (Theres also a son underloved by both Cooper and Nolan played by Timothee Chalamet.) Cooper comforts Murphy by saying that due to the space-time continuum she might be the same age as he is if he makes it back alive. ""Imagine that"" he says tenderly. (Nolan is unafraid to go to dark places but he dares not touch the plots tacit Freudian ""daddy"" themes even if his idol Kubrick wouldve found them irresistible.) Using his IMAX camera like a GoPro Nolan crosscuts Coopers truck speeding away from home with his spaceship liftoff. A female explorer unsubtly named Amelia (Anne Hathaway) is a partner on the journey. They encounter an astronaut from a previous expedition called Dr. Mann played by an A-list actor whose identity Nolan has kept secret. ""Mann can save us"" says Amelia in one eye-roller of a double entendre. The comic-book dialogue is porcupined with exclamation points. ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" the poem that has been crooned by everyone from David Tennant on Doctor Who to Rodney Dangerfield in Back to School is recited--twice--in hokey solemnity. Yet Nolan as ever understands awe. In Inception a city street folded onto itself. Here in a set piece of terrifying grandeur an ocean wave as perpendicular as a canyon wall hurtles forward. Later in a little wink of a scene kids play baseball in a neighborhood where the houses curl up and over the field. In Inception Nolan presented a puzzle-box concept of limbo the lowest dream level where time stretches out for decades. Here he ingeniously flips it inside out on a planet in which one hour equals seven Earth years. Hence the casting of Jessica Chastain as Coopers daughter all grown up. Chastain Hathaway and McConaughey are authentic emotive performers and they cry enough in Interstellar to irrigate cornfields. The waterworks are not contagious. Especially in the pathos-drenched final section Nolan backed by Hans Zimmers hysterical score tugs strenuously at our heartstrings. But all we feel is the tugging. For a brief moment in galactic time our most brilliantly cold and clinical filmmaker forgets how to go gentle into that good night.

This is a gigantosaurus movie entertainment set partly in outer space and partly in a futuristic dustbowl America where humans are in danger of dying out and Nolan -- who co-wrote the script with his brother Jonathan -- has front-loaded it with big themes and even bigger visuals. Interstellar is supposedly all about what it means to be human but its supersized in case we really are so out of touch that we need to have everything blown up IMAX-big. ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars"" says Matthew McConaugheys farmer-astronaut-dreamer in one of his many many proclamations about life family and the cosmos. ""Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" But even the dirt in Interstellar looks spectacularly art-directed. Nolan may be invoking Walker Evans but Interstellar is really just Jethro Bodine-sized. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - This is all the wonder money can buy and then some. Nolan opens the movie with faux-documentary commentary from old folks settin a spell and reflecting on their youth in a dying dust-choked world. One woman -- recognizable as Ellen Burstyn -- says that her father was a farmer ""like everybody else back then."" In the world of this womans childhood theres a surfeit of engineers and not enough people to grow food. Which means that men of science have been forced into the more menial (though not less important) job of coaxing life out of dry dirt.McConaugheys Cooper is one of these guys though he can never disavow his science-geek roots. One of his two kids (played by Timothee Chalamet as a youngster but hell grow up to be Casey Affleck) isnt doing well in school; hell be placed as a farmer instead of being one of the lucky few to advance to engineering school. But Coopers daughter 12-year-old Murph (Mackenzie Foy who will eventually morph into a petulant one-note Jessica Chastain) soaks up her dads sciencey musings. She gets into trouble at school for showing off one of her fathers old books about the Apollo 11 lunar landing which the asshole autocrats of the future have deemed propaganda just a bit of fakery pulled off by the United States to bankrupt the Soviet Union.Film Details Interstellar RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time169 min. More Info Trailer Cooper will end up leaving Murph and Earth A seemingly random -- but not really -- chain of events leads him to a secret space station where an old professor of his Michael Caines Dr. Brand is planning a mission. Though NASA was dismantled long ago -- space travel for explorations sake was long ago deemed frivolous by the government -- Dr. Brand and his team chief among them his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) believe that the only hope for mankind lies in the stars. Luckily Brand has located a wormhole leading to another galaxy which may contain at least one inhabitable planet. And so Cooper along with Amelia and two other crew members (played by Wes Bentley and David Gyasi) head into space in search of dust-free air and unspoiled water.Cooper and his colleagues encounter frozen worlds and watery ones and the dangers they face are both existential and specific. The universe Nolan has invented for them drawn from both science (the movie is partly inspired by the work of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne) and movie dreams (paging Stanley Kubrick) is vast awe-inspiring and terrifying. In an early scene the crew chatter and pick at one another inside the cabin but thanks to crackerjack cutting camerawork and sound design we can float on the outside where its deafeningly quiet -- the planes of the ship hang delicately in the breach of nothingness. This vessel is so gorgeously alone; for a moment Nolan captures the idea of space as a source of both wonder and despair.But even the grandest visuals arent enough to carry Interstellar. A chief complaint filed against Alfonso Cuarons joy-and-anguish-in-space symphony Gravity was that the dialogue was sentimental and there was too much of it. But in Interstellar Cooper a man of science soaks up plenty of oxygen with his bromides about the importance of family. Other characters follow suit apparently never having heard the song telling us that were people who need people. Nolan gives John Lithgow as Coopers salt-of-the-earth father-in-law healthy heaps of cornpone dialogue like ""Theyre saying this is the last harvest for okra. Forever.""Theres more As a coda to a complicated explanation of the black hole Bentleys character adds helpfully that its ""a literal heart of darkness."" Dylan Thomass ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" is quoted at least three times in case we dont grasp its significance the first two. At one point three crew members leave the mothership to explore a possibly life-sustaining planet. The catch poignant in its implications is that seven Earth years will pass for each hour they spend on this threateningly foreign soil. Gyasis character -- hes the token black guy but at least the movie has one -- stays behind and when McConaughey and company return not only is he visibly aged but hes wearing a plaid Redd Foxx bathrobe.Look maybe theres science to back this up For all we know its possible astronauts do wear flannel in space. I know Im supposed to be moved and amazed by Interstellars many pronouncements about how important it is to feel connected to our families and our fellow human beings in addition to being awed by Nolans elaborate vision of pioneers bravely striking out into space a/k/a the final frontier. And the special effects in Interstellar are well stellar It earns the adjective ""handsome"" which is great as far as that takes you. You sure get a big bang for your buck.If Nolan is so godlike youd think hed be better with actors. They dont stand a shooting stars chance in Interstellar. (Hans Zimmers droney churchy organ score the worst kind of Zimmermusik doesnt help.) Lithgow is a terrific actor -- hes already given one of the finest performances of the year in Ira Sachss Love Is Strange. Cant Nolan do better than cast him as pops in a cardigan spewing lines cribbed from the Farmers Almanac? Hathaways big moment -- her only moment really -- is a quavery speech about true love; she emotes like gangbusters as her eyes pool with Fantine-like tears. In the past few years McConaughey has reinvented himself into a marvel of spark and fire and subtlety. What he does here isnt acting; its superacting. Theres no other way to stand up to the manmade-monument quality of this material. In what should be McConaugheys most moving scene -- he faces the reality that his children have aged by 23 years while hes only a few hours older -- Nolan trains the camera on the actors face so we can take the measure of his free-falling tears. The tears themselves arent the issue -- its wholly believable that Cooper would cry. But we can see McConaughey working the strings. Hes like the Magic Mike version of male vulnerability turning it all on for show. If he were to work with Nolan all the time hed be in grave danger of becoming a neck-tendon actor He tightens his jaw every time he has to say something of great import which here is way too often.Nolan does have a seemingly inexhaustible store of extravagant ideas. As in Inception with that dream vision of Paris folding in on itself -- a wonderful inventive image that stands out against the rest of that movies bland trickery -- he comes up with one extraordinary visual idea in Interstellar Cooper finds himself in a corrugated passageway whose walls appear to be made of strands of light -- or are they books on a shelf? The metaphor is lovely a suggestion that books -- all paper glue ink and string so old-fashioned and so touchingly fragile -- still hold incomparable power. Their rays reach out to us like sunbeams.But thats about as subtle as Interstellar gets. Whatever his strengths may be Nolan lacks the human touch. His movies are numbingly sexless and by that I dont mean they need sex scenes or nudity -- those things are rarely really about sex anyway. But in all of Nolans films human connection is such a noble idea that its beyond the grasp of flesh-and-blood people. Nothing in Interstellar is ever ragged or raw or dirty (though there is admittedly a lot of dust). Characters gabble on about taking risks about needing one another but they never leap toward anything so dangerous as intimacy. ""Rage against the dying of the light"" Nolan urges us and he himself burns through a great deal of electricity and gas to keep his spectacle glowing for as long as possible. He has so much invested in showing us. He just doesnt want to get close enough to touch us. Space suits him just fine.Correction An earlier version of this review misidentified David Gyasi. He is correctly identified in this version.

"Review Interstellar a sublime cosmic knockout | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review Interstellar a sublime cosmic knockout By JAKE COYLE Oct. 31 2014 1258 AM EDT Since his breakthrough with the backward-running ""Memento"" Christopher Nolan has made a plaything of time. In ""Interstellar"" he slips into its very fabric shaping its flows and exploding its particles. Its an absurd endeavor. And its one of the most sublime movies of the decade.As our chief large-canvas illusionist Nolans kaleidoscope puzzles have often dazzled more than they have moved prizing brilliant hocus-pocus architecture over emotional interiors. But a celestial warmth shines through ""Interstellar"" which is at heart a father-daughter tale grandly spun across a cosmic tapestry.There is turbulence along the way. ""Interstellar"" is overly explanatory about its physics its dialogue can be clunky and you may want to send composer Hans Zimmers relentless organ into deep space. But if you take these for blips rather than black holes the majesty of ""Interstellar"" is something to behold.The film opens in the near future where a new kind of Dust Bowl one called ""the blight"" brings crop-killing storms of dust upon the Midwest farm of engineer-turned-farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his two children the adventuresome 10-year-old Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and the 15-year-old budding farmer Tom (Timothee Chalamet). The rustic homestead where Cooper and his father-in-law (John Lithgow) drink beer on the porch recalls the Indiana home of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" -- an early hint that ""Interstellar"" -- moving and sentimental -- will be more Spielberg (who was once attached to direct) than Kubrick.In the imperiled climate space exploration is viewed as part of the ""excess"" of the 20th century. Textbooks now read that the moon landings were faked. But Cooper a former NASA pilot still believes in sciences capacity for greatness. He seethes ""We used to look up in the sky and wonder about our place in the stars. Now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dirt.""The spirit of wonderment too has sometimes lacked in our movies. Nolan -- who shot in both 35mm and 70mm and prefers his films massive on Imax but not thank our stars in 3-D -- remains one of the few purveyors of DeMille-sized big-screen grandeur.Nolan shoots for the stars literally and cinematically when Coopers curiosity (he and Murph tail a flying drone through the wheat fields) brings him to a secret NASA lair run by a Dr. Brand (Michael Caine). Large-scale dreaming has gone underground. They enlist him to pilot a desperate mission through a wormhole to follow an earlier expedition that may have found planets capable of hosting human life.Much discussion of gravity and relativity follows as Nolan (who co-wrote the script with his brother Jonathan and consulted with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne) tries valiantly to place his quasi-plausible sci-fi tale within the realm of mathematics and science. ""Interstellar"" is a trip for sure but its not a supernatural one. There will be no aliens poking forth from bellies or monument-blasting battles with extraterrestrials; its just about us humans.The journey means Cooper will under the best of circumstances be gone for years. The parting from Murph who resents the abandonment is wrenching. Hes a dutiful driven father stepping out to work only in another galaxy. All they can send him are video messages.His crew are Brands daughter (Anne Hathaway) a pair of researchers (a wonderful David Gyasi and Wes Bentley) and a robot named TARS that looks like the monolith of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" if it were a shape-shifting Transformer. Voiced by Bill Irwin its programed to speak with 90 percent honesty and a dash of humor.What happens when the space ship Endurance moves past Saturn and passes through the wormhole? For starters Nolan and his cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema conjure beautiful galactic imagery contorting space and eventually dimensions.But what hes really doing is dropping countless big ideas --science survival exploration love -- into a cosmic blender and seeing what keeps its meaning out there in the heavenly abyss. As in ""The Dark Knight"" Nolan doesnt investigate all of its philosophical questions so much as juggle them in an often dazzling occasionally frustratingly incomplete way.But under extreme gravitational forces the core of ""Interstellar"" holds. It remains tethered to Earth toggling between barren otherworldly landscapes and life back home on an increasingly uninhabitable planet. There Murph (now played by Jessica Chastain) has grown into a physicist trying to solve an essential equation.More than anything ""Interstellar"" makes you feel the great preciousness of time a resource as valuable as oxygen. A misadventure of a few hours on one watery planet where relative time accelerates costs the astronauts decades. Returning to the ship Cooper watches videos of his kids growing up before his eyes and weeps uncontrollably.All of the visual awe the quantum mathematics the seeming complexity of the hugely ambitious nearly three hour-long film is just stardust clouding the orbit between a dad and his girl. Whereas most science fiction withers out in space ""Interstellar"" rockets home.""Interstellar"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""some intense perilous action and brief strong language.""

"Christopher Nolans Interstellar reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up I Snickered at Interstellar but I Never Stopped Staring in Wonder I Snickered at Interstellar but I Never Stopped Staring in Wonder Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 30 2014 1018 AM Visionary Hokum I snickered at Interstellar but I never stopped staring in wonder. By Dana Stevens One giant leap for Matthew McConaughey. Photo courtesy Paramount Pictures Anyone bemoaning the dearth of original scripts in a movie marketplace dominated by adaptations remakes and sequels should in theory be thrilled by Christopher Nolans Interstellar a sprawling metaphysical science-fiction epic thats nothing if not original. Interstellar does engage in its share of homages and borrowings from film history We open on a car chase through a cornfield thats a drone-era update of the climactic chase in North by Northwest. The plot about a group of astronauts sent into space to investigate a mysterious anomaly explicitly recalls that of 2001 A Space Odyssey. The use of special effects to communicate radical perceptual shifts comes courtesy of The Matrix. But for better or worse Interstellar stubbornly remains its own whacked-out inimitable self a century-spanning family soap opera thats simultaneously a cowboy space opera. Oh and a serious philosophical treatise on both human mortality and the concept of time. And possibly if unsatisfyingly also a dystopian environmental parable of some kind or other? Chris Nolan movies like death-metal concerts are best attended wearing some sonic safety gear. There might be a few more genres that would comfortably fit into the roomy 169-minute running time of Interstellar a movie I snickered at more than once but never stopped staring at in wonder. This isnt Nolans best film by any stretch but it abounds in the qualities that are among his strengths evoking a sense of visual awe crafting balletically sleek large-scale action sequences (remember the somersaulting semi in The Dark Knight?) and casting actors (especially male ones) who deliver fierce and memorable performances even in roles that are less than fully fleshed out. Unfortunately Interstellar also showcases some of Nolans persistent weaknesses dialogue (written by Nolan and his brother and frequent writing partner Jonathan) that lays out the films big ideas and themes with the assiduity of a new employee at a whiteboard. Female characters who spend most of their screen time however much theyre given as either helpmates or victims. And a tendency toward intellectual and auditory bombast Here its Michael Caine bellowing quite a bit of Dylan Thomas ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" as a spacecraft launches deafeningly into the stratosphere Hans Zimmers booming music jockeying for a place in the mix. I actually watched the entirety of Interstellar wearing foam earplugs brought along for that purpose because Chris Nolan movies like death-metal concerts are best attended wearing some sonic safety gear (especially if the film is being screened in IMAX as Interstellar will be in some theaters when it opens Nov. 7). The earplugs came in handy right away in that gorgeously shot opening cornfield sequence in which equally gorgeous single dad Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his children Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy) chase a descending drone until it crashes in a field then toss it into the back of their truck to take it apart for salvage. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Advertisement The exact nature of the futuristic dystopia Cooper and his kids inhabit takes a while to establish itself and in fact never fully emerges into relief. Were given no explanatory date-stamps or backstory-furnishing voiceovers and the world Cooper his children and his gentle father (John Lithgow) live in looks externally fairly similar to our own--there are cars and computers functioning schools and governments even organized games of what appears to be minor-league baseball. But gradually we learn that some time ago the earths soil stopped supporting any crop but corn and okra--and the last extant okra field is about to die out. Dust storms kicked up by the erosion of topsoil due to worldwide blight periodically ravage the land. The human population is on a mathematically chartable course toward extinction; as another character grimly observes to Cooper at one point their childrens generation is likely to be the last to survive. Cooper who was once a crack spaceship pilot gets recruited (or depending how you look at it coerced) into a top-secret exploratory mission organized by what remains of NASA--an institution thats had to go underground in an era in which for some reason official ideology insists that the moon landing was faked. (Better not let Buzz Aldrin hear you say that dystopian future) After an accumulation of seemingly supernatural coincidences that would be too spoilery to reveal even if I could understand them Cooper agrees to take the job though it will mean leaving his children behind on a rapidly failing planet. Hes assured by NASA chief Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) that somewhere near Saturn scientists have located a disturbance in space-time; it may be the human races only hope of skipping through a wormhole and locating a habitable planet in an otherwise impossibly distant galaxy. Get used to hearing about that wormhole because it becomes the Piccadilly Circus of Interstellar the intergalactic traffic hub around which the films various plotlines whip in intersecting circles. After agonizingly tearing himself away from his family Cooper sets out for Saturn aware that because the effect of relativity on the passage of time he may not find his way back through the wormhole to Earth before his childrens lifespans are long over if he survives the trip at all. ""Time is a resource like oxygen or food"" he explains to his crew pressing on them the importance of quickly gathering data on the three possible planets theyre investigating as replacement Earths. Meanwhile back on the regular earth Tom and Murph grow into adults played by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain. For many years the siblings maintain the hope that their father will return but eventually Toms video messages--which take years to be relayed remotely to Cooper in deep space and to which he cant respond--trickle to a despairing halt. As for Murph she cant forgive her dad for abandoning his own children even if its to serve the human race. Coopers fellow crew on the Endurance consists of planetary scientist Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) astrophysicist Romilly (David Gyasi) and co-pilot Doyle (Wes Bentley). Theres also a pair of affable monolith-shaped robots CASE and TARS--both hydraulic puppets operated by the actor and clown Bill Irwin. What happens on the ship is far less dramatically interesting than it ought to be given the mind-bending experiences these four humans and two machines go through together. (At one point a pair of explorers return from what seems like an afternoons worth of adventure to find their crewmates unfathomably transformed.) Still the movies middle third is visually and technically breathtaking with two back-to-back planetary exploration sequences of staggering beauty and scale. One world has water--overwhelming amounts of it periodically rising up in tidal waves the size of mountains. Another is all jagged frigidly cold rock faces with one surprising sign of life. McConaughey makes for a rakish existential hero weighing his duty to humanity against his devotion to his kids while taking time to assure his crewmates in that Robert Mitchum drawl of his that he has the piloting chops to ""swing around that neutron star and decelerate."" The rest of the cast including the vastly overqualified Chastain in a one-note role as the resentful wronged daughter swings around the neutron star that is McConaughey himself--no one gives a bad performance but the cast never coalesces into an ensemble. Hathaways character in particular seems indistinctly imagined with hints at a painful past love story thats never fully explored. Top Comment Ive been looking forward to the movie but I have a feeling Im going to be overly upset by the father never seeing his children again. Fatherhood has made me such a sop.  More... -Belisarius85 Join In The protracted last act of Interstellar (which contains at least three discrete moments that could easily have been endings but arent) ties the outer-space plot up with the meanwhile-back-at-the-ranch one via a development thats at once metaphysical and sort-of-seemingly scientific. (The theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant.) How you feel about the movie may hang on your reaction to this scene--about which Ill say only that like the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey it takes place in a space that seems to exist in between the familiar world we know and some strange alternate dimension. Going back over and over this crucial moment with a fellow critic on the train home I could make no sense of it--where was the encounter meant to be taking place? What laws of the universe or of human relationships did it purport to disclose? But the sense of visual and spatial wonder this scene evoked in me lingered long after accompanied by a begrudging respect for the Nolans sheer commitment to their own peculiar brand of visionary hokum.

Entertainment ""Interstellar"" Is The Ultimate Movie About An All-American Bro Saving Humanity Christopher Nolan gets his biggest canvas yet but still cant figure out a way to balance his spectacularly realized action with human drama. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar Paramount Pictures ID 4132664 In Interstellar Matthew McConaugheys Cooper is cushioned in the iconography of a teenage Superman living in the midst of verdant fields of corn with his pickup truck Carhartt jacket and jeans. McConaughey with his bright white smile and warm drawl is already an actor who feels as American as a hamburger made of ground-up bald eagles. And here hes playing a farmer and an astronaut two professions as dear to our national mythology as cowboys and apple pie. Hes also a dad a fact the movie valiantly tries to pretend it believes is interesting. The world is ending in Interstellar Christopher Nolans expansive gorgeous frustrating and sometimes super dumb latest movie which opens in theaters on Nov. 7; but we dont really see the world. Aside from a departing shot of the planet from a spaceship what we get of the Earth is limited to the area of countryside in which Cooper and his family have been eking out their precarious living and the hidden NASA base in which scientists and engineers mill around allegedly trying to save the human race. The limited earthbound vista is in part a factor of Interstellars dying future where air travel and international communication seem to have died off. Everyones resources have instead focused on the increasingly difficult immediate task of growing things to eat -- blight has been killing off crops species by species. An Indian surveillance drone drifting down after years of automated hovering is the lone reminder that there is (or was?) life on other parts of the globe. If cities still exist they also stay off screen -- with food and technology so scarce rural has become the way to go. ID 4123379 Paramount Pictures Paramount Pictures Paramount Pictures ID 4132777 And anyway screw all those suckers amirite? Interstellar which Nolan wrote with his brother Jonathan is not about broader cooperation or conservation. Its a sometimes poignant but more often pandering ode to American exceptionalism and also trusting in great men to save us provided theyre the right great men (not all of the candidates on screen measure up). The film directly links the survival of mankind to the restless frontier spirit of which Cooper is the ultimate embodiment. Hes the man meant to enable us to finally build a big ol baseball diamond in the sky. ""Its like weve forgotten who we are -- explorers pioneers not caretakers"" Cooper muses to his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) whos been helping him raise his teenage son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and younger daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) after his wife died of cancer. ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt"" Cooper continues. A former pilot on a failed mission that took place before NASA was forced to go underground Cooper is still jonesing for the job he feels he was born to do when the movie begins. He gets his chance when he and Murph find their way to the hidden outpost where his old colleague Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) have been launching ships in search of a new home for humanity. Coopers so certain of his hotshot destiny that when Professor Brand says after an apparent few minutes together ""I cant tell you any more unless you agree to pilot this craft"" he doesnt laugh out loud. Because of course theres a top secret space mission thats just been waiting for him the best pilot there is even though they never tried to contact him before this moment even though yesterday he fully believed NASA had been shut down Humanity needs Cooper demands him even if it means Murph will resent him for leaving her behind. ID 4132606 Paramount Pictures Paramount Pictures ID 4132817 Interstellar is a movie that heightens everything Nolan does well as a director along with his weaknesses which look more glaring in a story that wagers so much on emotional drama. Its supersized in every way -- in scope in appearance (it was partially shot in IMAX) in booming audio that includes a less-thrummy-than-usual Hans Zimmer score and in its nearly three-hour runtime. And when it takes to space it soars offering up giant stomach-dropping sequences of the spaceship Endurance as it spins past Saturn toward a wormhole that will bring it close to a group of possibly inhabitable planets. Nolans at his best in the film when bringing new vistas to life which he does here with the help of cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (who shot Her and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) and a host of visual effects artists. Space is breathtakingly vast and silent dwarfing the tiny structures in which Cooper Amelia and fellow travelers Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi) are housed. Planets are genuinely foreign spaces -- the first and most memorable (which there is a glimpse of in the trailer) turns out to be like a nightmarishly massive wave pool when the visitors slowly realize what theyre seeing on the horizon arent mountains. When he tries for awe Nolan tends to get it. But in the other half of Interstellar he aims for pathos never his strong suit and whiffs. Its partly due to the convolutions of the movies setup which waves away a lot of science (Gravity this is not) while holding on to the idea of the effects of relativity like a talisman. But its also thanks to the roughness with which Cooper Murph and the other characters are sketched out. Cooper promises his kids to return which in the context of the insanely dangerous mission hes accepted seems like a cruel or deluded thing to say but its one he actually believes always acting on his multiyear trip like his parking meters about to run out. ID 4132792 Paramount Pictures Paramount Pictures ID 4132881 Murph sulks over her fathers leaving a resentment that she carries into adulthood (where shes played by Jessica Chastain) even when she understands the stakes -- shes a genius whos still apparently emotionally 9 years old. And Brand in the worst scene in the movie has a speech about relying on the power of love to make a major team decision thats both ludicrous and a frankly offensive thing to put in the mouth of a supposedly serious scientist. Its tempting to point to Nolans record of preferring his female characters to be dead but Interstellar also shortchanges adult Tom (Casey Affleck) as well as Romilly who goes through something traumatic thats made to feel like a punch line. The movie just cant plausibly get into the headspace of people going through the unprecedented experiences its characters do and therefore it constantly smacks of psychological phoniness in everything but Coopers love for what hes doing the one emotion Nolan doesnt seem to have any difficulty relating to. Its not an accident that his best film The Prestige explored how ambition drove its two main characters to destroy each other in their competition to be the best. Dedication to a cause or calling at the cost of everything else is a theme you can pick out in all of his movies and Interstellar suffers in halfheartedly trying to pretend theres some kind of counterbalance. When it pauses for human drama -- and it does frequently -- Interstellar feels empty despite the efforts of its strong cast. When it slings Cooper (and McConaughey is as always incredibly watchable) into the far reaches of space and has him improvise his way through a million impossible challenges its thrilling. But when it tries to bring the human drama and the thrills together in its off-the-rails final act its an enterprising mess. But there he goes the all-American hero with a charismatic glow a cocky grin and a proclaimed love for the children he doesnt actually seem to want to spend time with. Hes better at grand acts of bravery and sacrifice than sticking it out at home with the rest of the norms. Hed hang around but hes got so much to do at the intergalactic office -- but hell be back in time for dinner. Bedtime at the latest.

""Explorers pioneers -- not caretakers."" That could be Christopher Nolan speaking about movies in this timid age of old genres endlessly recycled and coarsened. Hes the rare filmmaker with the ambition to make great statements on a grand scale and the vision and guts to realize them. Nolan is also a consummate conjuror. Memento his amnesiac movie ran its scenes in reverse order. In The Prestige magicians devised killer tricks for each other and the audience. Inception played its mind games inside a sleepers head and the Dark Knight trilogy raised comic-book fantasy to Mensa level. But those were the merest etudes for Nolans biggest boldest project. Interstellar contemplates nothing less than our planets place and fate in the vast cosmos. Trying to reconcile the infinite and the intimate it channels matters of theoretical physics -- the universes ever-expanding story as science fact or fiction -- through a daddy-daughter love story. Double-domed and defiantly serious Interstellar is a must-take ride with a few narrative bumps. In the near future a crop disease called ""the blight"" has pushed the Earth from the 21st century back to the agrarian 1930s the worlds a dust bowl and were all Okies. In this wayback culture schools teach that the Apollo moon landings were frauds as if America must erase its old achievements in order to keep people from dreaming of new ones. Farmer Coop once an astronaut needs to slip this straitjacket and do something. So does his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy); shes getting ""poltergeist"" signals from her bookshelves. A strange force leads them to a nearby hideout for NASA whose boss Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) drafts Coop to pilot a mission to deep space. With Brands daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and two others as his crew Coop is to find a wormhole near Saturn that may provide an escape route for humanity. ""Were not meant to save the world"" Brand says. ""Were meant to leave it."" Coop a widower wasnt meant to leave his children. Son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) can manage; but the precocious Murph sees abandonment and betrayal in Dads journey to save billions of humans. Coop who thinks a parents main role is to be ""the ghosts of our childrens future"" shares Murphs ache. He needs her. He goes out so he can come back. Whats out there? New worlds of terror and beauty. Transported by the celestial Ferris wheel of their shuttle Coop and the crew find the wormhole a snow globe glowing blue. One planet it spins them towards has a giant wall of water that turns their spacecraft into an imperiled surfboard. Another planet where treachery looms is icy and as caked with snow granules as Earth was with dust. Interstellar may never equal the blast of scientific speculation and cinematic revelation that was Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey but its un-Earthly vistas are spectral and spectacular. Someone on the icy planet says ""Our world is cold stark but undeniably beautiful."" Shuttling between the grad-school blackboard and the family hearth this undeniably beautiful film blows cold and hot stark and sentimental by turns. Taking the visual wow factor as a given you may feel two kinds of wonder a childs astonishment at the effects and a bafflement that asks ""I wonder why thats happening."" Its not just that the rules of advanced physics as tossed out every 15 minutes or so are beyond the ken of most movie-goers. Its also that some scenes border on the risible -- a wrestling match in space suits -- and some characters like Amelia are short on charm and plausibility. In story terms her connection with Coop is stronger than that of the two astronauts in Gravity. But Sandra Bullock and George Clooney gave their roles emotional heft in a film more approachable and affecting than this one. If the heart of Interstellar is Coops bond with Murph its soul is McConaugheys performance as a strong tender hero; in the films simplest most potent scene he sheds tears of love and despair while watching remote video messages from his kids. He is the conduit to the feelings that Nolan wants viewers to bathe in empathy for a space and time traveler who is above all a father. With Interstellar Nolans reach occasionally exceeds his grasp. Thats fine These days few other filmmakers dare reach so high to stretch our minds so wide. And our senses all of them. At times dispensing with Hans Zimmers pounding organ score Nolan shows a panorama of the spacecraft in the heavens -- to the music of utter silence. At these moments viewers can hear their hearts beating to the sound of awe.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 103 p.m. EST November 7 2014Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck in a scene from Interstellar(Photo Melinda Sue Gordon Paramount Pictures / Warner Brothers Entertainment)While it reaches for the stars director Christopher Nolans Interstellar is a flawed masterpiece.The story is ever-ambitious sometimes riveting and thought-provoking but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting-edge special effects. And at nearly three hours the film would have benefited from more judicious editing ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens in select cities Nov. 5 nationwide Nov. 7). Its rare that a big-budget studio movie has such cerebral aspirations and such startling strengths and weaknesses. The visual spectacle can be breathtaking but the emotional earth-bound saga fails to be as moving. Its a heady tale about gravity and wormholes blended with a family melodrama. Last years Gravity touched on similar turf but Interstellar blows the concept out in more complex -- though sometimes more tedious -- fashion. Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Matthew McConaughey leads an all-star cast in Interstellar. As life on Earth deteriorates from environmental issues a group of explorers and scientists embark on a voyage to find another viable planet. VPCFor most laypeople its best not to get too caught up in the logistics. Just go with the notion of mind-blowing space travel necessitated by an impending apocalypse on Earth.Dirt storms have ravaged the U.S. The world is nearly out of food. The hardiest crop appears to be corn. Rows of stalks thrive in a landscape that looks both familiar and eerie. The story isnt set at any specific date and feels as though it could happen next month based on the architecture clothing and cars. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) was once a top pilot. He has two children Murphy (played as a child by Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain) and Tom (played in youth by Timothee Chalamet and later by Casey Affleck).Living in a world devastated by environmental blight Cooper stumbles on whats left of NASA and meets his old mentor Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) whose daughter is engineer Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway).Professor Brand has determined that Earth faces imminent extinction and that Cooper is the planets last hope. He asks him to pilot a space vessel beyond the reaches of space and time to ascertain if other planets could be habitable for Earthlings. Complicating matters for Cooper is his devotion to his two children. The key dilemma he faces is whether to stay with his family -- and thereby save them -- or save the world. Its a fascinating conundrum posed by writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. The bond between father and daughter in particular as beautifully played by McConaughey and Foy is stirring. Cooper decides he must undertake the mission in the hopes of saving the species. Hes accompanied by Amelia Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi) on an operation to slip through a wormhole near Saturn and search for planets that can sustain human life.A widower Cooper leaves his kids in care of their grandfather (John Lithgow) aware he may never see them again.Another of the films powerful themes is the idea that science and exploration have been set aside in a struggle for basic survival. Its a sobering notion.Along the way monotonous stretches in space undercut the storys time-bending grandeur as do minimalist exchanges between McConaughey and Hathaway whose chemistry as space-exploring partners is lacking. Hathaways character is not given much dimension. Other members of the space team are even less well-drawn so its hard to care what befalls them. What little we see of the ravaged Earth is more compelling in some ways than the cosmic canvas. The film could have used more grounded scenes. But it seems in a hurry to get to space. Once space and time are transcended the film flounders. Dull dialogue and tedious patches inside the space vessel provides a stumbling block.What is meant as a climactic humanistic ending seems to tie things up far too neatly for a film about the complex messiness that comes with a world that has taken dramatic wrong turns.Though its heart and mind are in the right place for a space epic aiming for profound resonance Interstellar falls short. 243 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 39 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1u0tu2v",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/27/interstellar-review/18018445/,200,interstellar44,interstellar,usatoday

To infinity and beyond goes ""Interstellar"" an exhilarating slalom through the wormholes of Christopher Nolans vast imagination that is at once a science-geek fever dream and a formidable consideration of what makes us human. As visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done the directors ninth feature also proves more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and Batman movies touching on such eternal themes as the sacrifices parents make for their children (and vice versa) and the world we will leave for the next generation to inherit. An enormous undertaking that like all the directors best work manages to feel handcrafted and intensely personal ""Interstellar"" reaffirms Nolan as the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation more than earning its place alongside ""The Wizard of Oz"" ""2001"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Gravity"" in the canon of Hollywoods visionary sci-fi head trips. Global box office returns should prove suitably rocket-powered. We begin somewhere in the American farm belt which Nolan evokes for its full mythic grandeur -- blazing sunlight towering corn stalks whirring combines. But it soon becomes clear that this would-be field of dreams is something closer to a nightmare. The date is an unspecified point in the near future close enough to look and feel like tomorrow yet far enough for a number of radical changes to have taken hold in society. A decade on from a period of widespread famine the worlds armies have been disbanded and the cutting-edge technocracies of the early 21st century have regressed into more utilitarian farm-based economies. ""Were a caretaker generation"" notes one such homesteader (John Lithgow) to his widower son-in-law Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a former NASA test pilot who hasnt stopped dreaming of flight for himself and for his children 15-year-old son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and 10-year-old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) the latter a precocious tot first seen getting suspended from school for daring to suggest that the Apollo space missions actually happened. ""We used to look up in the sky and wonder about our place in the stars"" Cooper muses. ""Now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dirt."" And oh what dirt As ""Interstellar"" opens the world -- or at least Coopers Steinbeckian corner of it -- sits on the cusp of a second Dust Bowl ravaged by an epidemic of crop blight a silt-like haze hanging permanently in the air. (Some of this scene-setting is accomplished via pseudo-documentary interviews with the elderly residents of some more distant future reflecting on their hardscrabble childhoods which Nolan films like the ""witness"" segments from Warren Beattys ""Reds."") And as the crops die so the Earths atmosphere becomes richer in nitrogen and poorer in oxygen until the time when global starvation will give way to global asphyxiation. But all hope is not lost. NASA (whose massive real-life budget cuts lend the movie added immediacy) still exists in this agrarian dystopia but its gone off the grid far from the microscope of public opinion. There the brilliant physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine forever the face of avuncular wisdom in Nolans films) and his dedicated team have devised two scenarios for saving mankind. Both plans involve abandoning Earth and starting over on a new life-sustaining planet but only one includes taking Earths current 6-billion-plus population along for the ride. Doing the latter it seems depends on Brands ability to solve an epic math problem that would explain how such a large-capacity vessel could surmount Earths gravitational forces. (Never discussed in this egalitarian society a scenario in which only the privileged few could escape a la the decadent bourgeoisie of Neill Blomkamps ""Elysium."") Many years earlier Brand informs a mysterious space-time rift (or wormhole) appeared in the vicinity of Saturn seemingly placed there like the monoliths of ""2001"" by some higher intelligence. On the other side another galaxy containing a dozen planets that might be fit for human habitation. In the wake of the food wars a team of intrepid NASA scientists traveled there in search of solutions. Now a decade later (in Earth years that is) Brand has organized another mission to check up on the three planets that seem the most promising for human settlement. And to pilot the ship he needs Cooper an instinctive flight jockey in the Chuck Yeager mode much as McConaugheys laconic effortlessly self-assured performance recalls Sam Shepards as Yeager in ""The Right Stuff"" (another obvious ""Interstellar"" touchstone). Already by this point -- and we have not yet left the Earths surface -- ""Interstellar"" (which Nolan co-wrote with his brother and frequent collaborator Jonathan) has hurled a fair amount of theoretical physics at the audience including discussions of black holes gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space. And as with the twisty chronologies and unreliable narrators of his earlier films Nolan trusts in the audiences ability to get the gist and follow along even if it doesnt glean every last nuance on a first viewing. Its hard to think of a mainstream Hollywood film that has so successfully translated complex mathematical and scientific ideas to a lay audience (though Shane Carruths ingenious 2004 Sundance winner ""Primer"" -- another movie concerned with overcoming the problem of gravity -- tried something similar on a micro-budget indie scale) or done so in more vivid immediate human terms. (Some credit for this is doubtless owed to the veteran CalTech physicist Kip Thorne who consulted with the Nolans on the script and receives an executive producer credit.) The mission itself is a relatively intimate affair comprised of Cooper Brands own scientist daughter (Anne Hathaway) two other researchers (Wes Bentley and the excellent David Gyasi) and a chatty sarcastic ex-military security robot called TARS (brilliantly voiced by Bill Irwin in a sly nod to Douglas Rains iconic HAL 9000) which looks like a walking easel but proves surprisingly agile when the going gets tough. And from there ""Interstellar"" has so many wonderful surprises in store -- from casting choices to narrative twists and reversals -- that the less said about it the better. (Indeed if you really dont want to know anything more read no further.) It gives nothing away however to say that Nolan maps his infinite celestial landscape as majestically as he did the continent-hopping earthbound ones of ""The Prestige"" and ""Batman Begins"" or the multi-tiered memory maze of ""Inception."" The imagery modeled by Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema on Imax documentaries like ""Space Station"" and ""Hubble 3D"" suggests a boundless inky blackness punctuated by ravishing bursts of light the tiny spaceship Endurance gleaming like a diamond against Saturns great gaseous rings then ricocheting like a pinball through the wormholes shimmering plasmic vortex. With each stop the Endurance makes Nolan envisions yet another new world one planet a watery expanse with waves that make Waimea Bay look like a giant bathtub; another an ice climbers playground of frozen tundra and sheer-faced descents. Moreover outer space allows Nolan to bend and twist his favorite subject -- time -- into remarkable new permutations. Where most prior Nolan protagonists were forever grasping at an irretrievable past the crew of the Endurance races against a ticking clock that happens to tick differently depending on your particular vantage. New worlds mean new gravitational forces so that for every hour spent on a given planets surface years or even entire decades may be passing back on Earth. (Time as a flat circle indeed.) This leads to an extraordinary mid-film emotional climax in which Cooper and Brand return from one such expedition to discover that 23 earth years have passed in the blink of an eye represented by two decades worth of stockpiled video messages from loved ones including the now-adult Tom (a bearded brooding Casey Affleck) and Murphy (Jessica Chastain in dogged persistent ""Zero Dark Thirty"" mode). Its a scene Nolan stages mostly in closeup on McConaughey and the actor plays it beautifully his face a quicksilver mask of joy regret and unbearable grief. That moment signals a shift in ""Interstellar"" itself from the relatively euphoric adventurous tone of the first half toward darker more ambiguous terrain -- the human shadow areas if you will that are as difficult to fully glimpse as the inside of a black hole. Nolan who has always excelled at the slow reveal catches even the attentive viewer off guard more than once here but never in a way that feels cheap or compromises the complex motivations of the characters. On the one hand the movie marvels at the brave men and women throughout history who have dedicated themselves often at great peril to the greater good of mankind. On the other because Nolan is a psychological realist hes acutely aware of the toil such lives may take on those who choose to lead them and that even ""the best of us"" (as one character is repeatedly described) might not be immune from cowardice and moral compromise. Some people lie to themselves and to their closest confidants in ""Interstellar"" and Nolan understands that everyone has his reasons. Others compensate by making the most selfless of sacrifices. Perhaps the only thing trickier than quantum physics the movie argues is the nature of human emotion. Nolan stages one thrilling setpiece after another including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movies ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. ""Do not go gentle into that good night/Rage rage against the dying of the light"" harks the good Professor Brand at the start of the Endurances journey quoting the melancholic Welshman Dylan Thomas. And yet ""Interstellar"" is finally a film suffused with light and boundless possibilities -- those of the universe itself of the wonder in a childs twinkling eyes and of movies to translate all that into spectacular picture shows like this one. Its hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the films lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movies interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. Vfx supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the films effects especially the robotic TARS who seamlessly inhabits the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy Strauss-ian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks) ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen where its dense inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect.

Peoria Il Wedding Reception says January 8 2016 at 746 am Asking questions are actually nice thing if you are not understanding something totally however this piece of writing presents pleasant understanding even. Reply Chinyere says December 9 2015 at 606 am Outer space invisible realms and incomprehensible dimensions have always fascinated me and by extension the Science Fiction genre. After watching the mind-bending Interstellar and being profoundly awed by it I read up topics on gravity and its effects on time space phenomena relativity black holes wormholes and watched Interstellar a second time around with a better understanding. I realised there were similarities between Astronaut Cooper robot TARS ordeal and the Near-death experience. 1. People in near-death situations travel through a (black hole/wormhole?) tunnel. 2. They experience time space variation or the total absence of time. Some people are convinced that they have spent aeons in an alternate dimension when in fact they were dead for five or ten minutes of earth time. A sick patient I know was mortified and confused to discover that she had spent three months in coma. She argued vehemently that she had been on the other side for just a few minutes. Probably there is very minimum gravity effecting higher realms of existence. 3. People in Near-death situations are able to glimpse into past present and future timelines of earth and higher dimension events with all of it happening simultaneously in the now. 4. They experience that love transcends space and time. 5. They wake up (recover) like Cooper and believe that they have had a real and profound journey. In the near future I believe that the two parallel concepts of science and the paranormal will meet at a point of being a singular unified idea.

Reply davidw says April 12 2015 at 703 pm Here is my reading of most of the articles on this movie. The problem with this movie is that the main action set pieces are at best only tangentially related to the storys theme. And the set piece that does have to with the theme (at the end) is sort of absurd. I think the movie tries to be two different things - a movie about relations of family members and say Star Trek. It does not succeed in this nearly impossible task although it does try very hard. The movie tries to be extremely realistic and use lots of practical effects. This is incredibly refreshing. However this makes it all the more difficult to suspend disbelief for the thourghly absurd things it introduces later in the film. Some people liked the cinametography but I found it dull and lifeless. The spaceships where painfully realistic - they were dull black and white with harsh lighting and just...dirty. The exteriors also had that flat realistic look. Reply Ben says August 23 2015 at 1215 am Davidw There is nothing unreasonable about the ending. All Feynman diagrams for example work the same regardless of the direction of time. There is one time travel theory described in a book by Columbia Universitys Brian Greene which indicates that traveling back in time is logically possible if any changes made were sort of ""pre ordained"" to be made. That is if the totality of time includes backwards time travel with changes that allow the future to occur as putlined by the totality of time (that is there isnt a future that is altered by time teavel; instead the changes made into the past by the time travler arent really changes; they are all written into the history of time). As for higher dimensional beings read Flatland and the large amount of mathematical philosophical and scientific discussion on a universe with more than three spatial dimensions. And again these werent higher dimensional beings they were human descendants sending information back through time (again see Brian Greenes ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" and his other works). In short while the ending is highly speculative it is FAR from unreasonable speculation. You just hit the wall in your knowledge of the frontiers of astrophysics. Again the ending is highly speculative but based on our current understanding of physics it wasnt unreasonable speculation. Reply Matthew says January 4 2015 at 948 pm Oh man. Saw it 4th time today with parents. Im still blown away as it makes the hair on your skin stand and your heart melt. Reply arena23 says December 16 2014 at 502 pm This is really well written Im a big fan Reply Alfred G says November 27 2014 at 441 pm When you review a film you should critique the sound. Most people I have talked to complained that there were too many time when the dialog could not be understood. We do not all have the hearing of an 18 year old. Early in the picture the music reached dangerous levels. People were covering their ears. At the end of the picture in the last scene Ann Hathaway had some dialog which was completely covered up by the music. No matter how good the visuals are it takes dialog to tell the story. n this day and age it is unacceptable to have muffled sound to have whispered scenes that cannot be understood. In this day and age the technology is available to have good sound. Do not directors understand this? Do they not care? After Interstellar and Inception I have no desire to see another Christopher Nolan film. Directors have fallen into the trap that it is all about glorious visuals. It is not It is about the story. Reply Tim says November 24 2014 at 1024 am Personally I loved the film. Out of the full running time (169 minutes) there were a few cringe-worthy passages but frankly most movies have that during the beginning credits. This is a near-perfect representation of what the Science Fiction genre is about Big ideas coupled with personal connections and in the end... ultimately optimistic. Im so tired of the dystopia-driven drivel that masquerades as Science Fiction. That is the ultimate lazy-mans sci-fi (Im looking at you Hunger Games). Films like this and Gravity remind me why I fell in love with the genre years ago. The acting was excellent the settings and effects were great. Yes...there are a few holes in the storyline (where exactly did that wormhole come from?) but as an overall narrative it hangs together very well. The ambition of the movie is far-reaching and it has startling depth. Is it perfect? No. Is it a great movie? Yes. Reply adam says April 4 2015 at 1155 am I watched the bluray version through a good sound system and the music does drown the dialogue. Nolans film ""the prestige"" remains his best. Reply Tom says November 16 2014 at 127 am Exceptional film. Loved every second (of which there are many). Sure you can pick it apart if if you like but you can pick apart any film - this is science-FICTION people. They used Kip Thorne to get it as credible as possible and when they hit the unknowns Nolans mind/imagination took over. There are plenty of theories about how black holes are supposed to behave how gravity is meant to work mathematically. But has anyone actually been to a black hole and checked it out to verify whos right? Um no. So give Nolan break dont take it too seriously enjoy the movie... or go watch a documentary and let the dreamers dream. This movie is awesome and for me highlights one very real thing - one day humans will have to leave this planet. The sun will get too big and the earth will become way too hot for life to survive. I would hope one day we find a way to move on. Reply Abahelafeliak says November 14 2014 at 911 pm INTERSTELLAR I must say was VERY disappointing. The vain imaginations of mens minds. Really it was irrational nonsensical rubbish. I would rate it a 3 out of 10. The story line was as above the camera work good the special effects good the acting reasonable from Matthew McConaughey. The rest so so. I do not think this film will rate well. If it does I will be most surprised. It is a very vain attempt to rationalize mans existence. Reply Carl says January 9 2016 at 756 pm Irrational? A film cant be rational or irrational. Good camera work? Good special effects? Are you a simpleton? Mans existence does not require rationalization. Are you criticising the film-makers for attempting to do so because it is futile? Life is futile and when you see someone try to say otherwise that means theyre making a bad movie but with good camera work? Good camera work can be rationalized right? Reply RAK3 says November 11 2014 at 912 am We think we would have enjoyed the film if the special effects and musical soundtrack had not overpowered out most of the dialog. Many viewers left about 1/2 way thru. The comments about the unreality of the film are correct but it is SCIFI people. Everyone has their own right to fantasize It is NOT a documentary. Reply Nic Valle says November 10 2014 at 812 pm This film is the equivalence of hitting yourself in the head with a hammer for three hours. What a pretentious garbled mess of a film. Reply John Apparite says November 10 2014 at 441 pm I so wanted to like this film since I am a lover of sci-fi cinema but INTERSTELLAR is just a lotta bit of a mess. Call me picky but there were too many distracting plot-holes and unbelievable moments for me to take this thing seriously. Heres just a few (SPOILERS APLENTY) Im supposed to believe that Cooper lives just MINUTES from a secret NASA facility? NASA desperately needs a pilot but they dont apparently even know hes just a 10 minute pickup ride away? They offer him the job without any apparent training (remember he last flew for NASA over a decade prior) and he jumps right in without missing a beat? The earth is on the brink of starvation everyone is just about to starve were told...and then 23 years later EVERYTHING looks exactly the same and no one seems to be starving at all? Presumably Global Warming is contributing to the crisis but when trouble arises every farmer just lights their fields on fire? The people they sent out departed 10 years earlier and NASAs JUST getting around to sending another crew to look for them? I can give another dozen examples but you get the idea (and this is all from the first third of the film). This movie when pressed under the weight of logic just crumbles. And way way too much was borrowed from other films. 2001-organ music monolith-like robots astronaut trying to force way thru airlock into spaceship character named Mann (Bowman) journey through wormhole/stargate sequence etc. Some of this might be put down as homage but much more seemed derivative if not lazy. And a lot of it didnt make sense and no attempt was given TO make sense of it. There was way too much time pushing books thru bookcases and no time at all explaining exactly HOW the ending came about. How does Cooper end up floating by Saturn? How did the starving people on earth construct a huge lovely green space station 2 years distant from earth? The whole interaction between he and his daughter in the study ate up minutes that could have been put to better use. Same with the beginning-way too much time spent with exposition frankly the whole film ran 45 minutes too long. Some of the special effects were lovely but some were not well done and the planets themselves were distinctly unimpressive (BTW how does one generate a 200 foot wave on a planet where the water is shallow enough to wade in to retrieve a data recorder?) Very little of this film made sense although I did love the organ music. Of course that mightve just been Hans Zimmer ripping himself off from that first scene of THE THIN RED LINE. But yeah I liked the music. Too bad it couldnt have been matched up with a better more believable more coherent film. Reply Dynnik says November 15 2014 at 919 am I totally agree with your review. // I would add as a personal comment that the Strauss organ homage amongst other homages quickly got me tired. It gets to show how singular were the other referenced films; even a ""Star Wars"" homage when he boards a ship at the end with TARS ()... Come on It confirmed to me as well how much ""Contact"" is an unappreciated jewel. How derivative in style ""Interstellar"" is Furthermore every line or conflict just felt too much like a cinematic artifice to support the relativity of time next to a black hole plot point. Script was too obvious with this. I think they thought they were making an intimate film but the relationships portrayed between the characters are too shallow for the audience to really root for anyone. Even the father /daughter scenes at the beginning are not well structured as to show their motivations and the much too exaggerated reaction from Murph. Also why not explore in detail the relationship (friendly or romantic?) between Brand and Cooper? That was a waste of talent on such unfocused scenes honesty to 90%... Of what?? Too obvious again. Made me appreciate ""Gravity"" much more in its minimalist but emotional mise-en-scene (not the grandiloquent visuals; I mean the character development). All in all nice entertaining film but... with delusions of being much more cinematically than it is. It lacked artistic and emotional honesty. For me Nolans prime is seen in ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"" for being very original and groundbreaking films (equally pretentious but less self-conscious). Reply juan says November 10 2014 at 117 pm I wanted to love this film like any other filmmaker/ spectator resting before the big screen hoping to be enveloped by it but was deeply disappointed at how shamelessly it steals from Contact. This film is to Contact what Treasure of the Sierra Madre is to Kurosawas Hidden Fortress. Does it cater to some of the aesthetic and narrative appetite wonderfully triggered in the spectator by the predecessor? Sure but even that possible upside is irreparably soiled by the lack of acknowledgment of the obvious sources. With little difficulty one could trace this films every plot point to one element or another in Contact fanning the ever-growing tendencies in Hollywood to ""borrow"" which amount to little more than plagiarism. Add to the mix permissive fanboy film ""journalism"" like this and the stage is set for a culture that rewards theft. And we dare lecture China on intellectual property rights? It is a sad scenario for all especially true lovers of cinema. In all its superficial virtues this film only outs its creators as frauds who owe a great deal to one Mr. Sagan and his collaborator Mr. Zemeckis. I wanted to love this film but instead left the Harlem Magic Johnson screening room at first angered then saddened at the bleak prospects for the filmmakers struggling to realize authentic work. Reply Barry Privett says November 9 2014 at 846 pm fyi foundasonfilm the interview clips are authentic and taken directly from Ken Burns doc ""The Dustbowl"" Reply Charles says November 9 2014 at 636 pm Hmmm. Interesting review. Appears to have omitted referring to the inordinate lumps of exposition dropped into the viewers lap the cloying cheap attempts at sentimentality the weak dialogue the paper-thin characters the gaping plot and logic holes the distorted and muddy sound design and the lack of emotional connection with the characters. Sure the movie deals with big topics including relativity and time distortion which I suppose is why this three hour movie felt like it lasted for three weeks instead.

Reply Raymond Aboud says November 7 2014 at 318 pm Worst film Ive seen this year. A shame given the incredible potential of the story line. The directors attempts to translate science for his audience simply do not work. Instead what we get is Nolans vanity gone wild overwhelming the story and the audience. As for dialogue it gets lost in too many of the scenes. While I stuck it out to the bitter end some on the audience did not walking out of the theatre well before the film ended. A case of a director injecting too much of his own creative ego into a movie that begs for a more clarity and a little less ""stuff"".

My wife and I could not understand all the awards and nominations Gravity received. It was quite ordinary. The essence of film should be the story.

Reply Ken says November 1 2014 at 947 am I would absolutely place Cuarons GRAVITY in the pantheon of great visionary fx-driven flicks (and its technical achievements will be referenced for years to come). As a study in 1 persons grit pluck survivalist determination against overwhelming odds GRAVITY is something of a compelling and suspenseful masterpiece. Its a fast tidy nearly perfect motion picture. It will stand the test of time. Reply Jedi77 says October 31 2014 at 321 am Very true. My reaction as well when Gravity was mentioned as a classic which it most certainly will never be. A fine film yes but it leaves you with nothing. Reply me says October 29 2014 at 303 pm And the same will be true of this picture even though I havent seen it yet of course. People throw around these words like ""visionary"" ""classic"" etc. like it means nothing. Just because a movie is different doesnt make it an instant classic. Of course the reviewer is too young to realize the ludicrousness of his remarks. Reply mksmgmail.com says October 29 2014 at 647 am So glad Nolan is giving the middle finger to short sighted multiplexes that ditched their film projectors by releasing it early in 70mm 35mm and 70mm Imax. And the cheek multiplex owners have in saying he is sending the industry backward. No he believes in quality and the art of film making. By offering flat muddy and lifeless digital projection in mutliplexes that dont even employ a projectionist that is sending the industry backward. Something that has been lost to the average modern audience thanks to the pedestrian experience peddled by AMC etc. There is no crime in shooting it on film and releasing it the way it was meant to be seen. 70mm Imax film has 10 times the color depth etc than digital movie projection. Such a sad grab at control by studios by forcing the DCP projection method down the industries throat. Cinema goers should be careful though most of the IMAX theatres in the U.S are not real IMAX (they are just slightly larger than standard screens situated in multiplexes branded IMAX with tickets charged at IMAX prices. For example the only actual real IMAX location in NYC is up at Lincoln Plaza and they have the 70mm Imax print. Not the inferior digital Imax that is being forced upon movie goers (yup they are even dumping those incredible projectors for inferior picture quality). Reply Mel says November 18 2014 at 142 pm Nope sorry saw it in real film IMAX and have to say film projection is DEAD. It looked like it was down a generation the contrast was harsh the whole thing looked ugly. I poked my nose into the next theater where they were screening it on a 4K digital projection and it looked a hundred times better since it was pulled from the original negative and not an interpositive. Not to mention the annoyance of huge bits of fuzz and hair appearing and disappearing throughout (particularly annoying on a white icy world) and the horrible striations caused by the glass film gate again glaringly apparent on a white icy world. Theres no way Ill ever see a film IMAX movie again if I have a choice. You can be a purist I suppose but that doesnt mean its a better theatrical experience. Reply Myka says November 8 2014 at 618 pm I agree with alot of what you are saying. My GF amp; I wasnt going to pay extra for Imax or XD with s screen slightly larger than a normal screen. No 70mm showings close to where we live. You still can tell it was shot on film instead of Digital (it was a clear nod to 2001 amp; Close Encounters being shot that way) Reply John says October 29 2014 at 514 am Jean-Michel you are absolutely correct. There is no way this particular plot point is feasible and considering all the hoopla about how scientifically accurate the movie is how they went out of their way to hire scientific consultants (Kip Thorne in particular) Im really surprised that this mistake got through especially considering it appears to be a large part of the story. Now all the talk has been about the black hole depicted in the movie. This was the perfect opportunity for the film makers to use a medium to explain the time travel aspect of their movie why didnt they use gravitational time dilation relating to the event horizon of the black hole to explain the time travel instead of the planet thing?

Reply Jean-Michel says October 27 2014 at 628 pm ""New worlds mean new gravitational forces so that for every hour spent on a given planets surface years or even entire decades may be passing back on Earth."" I saw something like this in a TV spot and Im really baffled by it. This is called ""gravitational time dilation"" and its certainly a thing but the effects are tiny tiny tiny in the grand scheme of things. For the effect to be anywhere near as strong as implied here wed be talking gravitational forces that would kill people long before they even set foot on the planet or planets with absurdly huge surface areas (as in bigger than our entire solar system) and absurdly low densities (as in nowhere dense enough to have a liquid surface never mind a solid one). So for anyone whos seen the movie do they actually explain this or is it just an instance where they threw real-world physics out the window to create some more dramatic tension? Reply EricSlusser says November 5 2014 at 840 pm It is somewhat more justified by having the planet orbiting a black hole. So theres nothing special about the planet per se. You will still be cringing at the physics and I at least was cringing at some of the more philosophical dialogue. Nevertheless I found the film extremely entertaining and artistic and would recommend it to everyone. Reply LOL says October 27 2014 at 136 pm The adult blockbuster needs reviving.

Loved the screening breathtaking effects one in particular was the shot showing the ship crossing the rings of Saturn I was literally mesmerized by it. With such a epic scope it was refreshing to see that the screenplay did not take a backseat to elaborate special effects and wondrous feats.

Feeling very much like Christopher Nolans personal response to his favorite film 2001 A Space Odyssey this grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos with mixed results but is never less than engrossing and sometimes more than that. Critical and public reaction will range across the horizon from the mesmeric to outright rejection for arguably hokey contrivances. But it is certainly some kind of event one that Paramount domestically and Warner Bros. overseas will massively promote as a hoped-for must-see for audiences everywhere. While it technically occupies the realm of science fiction this gargantuan enterprise brushes up against science fact--or at least intelligent speculation--as much as it can in an effort to make the idea of leaving and returning to our solar system as dramatically plausible as possible. But audiences tend to be accepting of even far-fetched premises as long as the rules of the game are clear. Where Nolan takes his big leap is in trying to invest his wannabe magnum opus with an elemental human emotion that between parent and child; its a genre graft that has intriguing wrinkles but remains imperfect. Citizens of the world convinced that our planet and civilization are now in a possibly irreversible decline will readily embrace the postulation of the script by the Nolan brothers Jonathan and Christopher that life here will shortly be unsustainable. Shrewdly the writers dont reflexively blame the deterioration on the catch-all ""global warming"" or ""climate change"" but rather upon severe ""blight"" resembling the Dust Bowl of the 1930s; wheat and other produce are done for while corn growers such as Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) may have a bit of time left. See more Interstellar Premiere Matthew McConaughey Anne Hathaway Christopher Nolan Hit Hollywood Cooper belongs to a lost generation; a former engineer and test pilot he expected to become an astronaut but dire economic conditions forced the closure of NASA and the abandonment of the space program. His precocious 10-year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) shares her fathers long-ago enthusiasm and one of the wittier scenes has an elementary school official reprimanding Murph for believing that the Apollo moon missions actually took place; history has been rewritten to insist that they were just propaganda designed to speed the bankrupting of the Soviet Union in its effort to compete (Nolan restrains himself from adding the canard that Stanley Kubrick filmed the fake moon landing). There are echoes as well of The Wizard of Oz emanating from Coopers remote farmhouse which he shares with his 15-year-old son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and Donald (John Lithgow) his late wifes father. All the same any fantasies of escape to a better place cannot be indulged -- as Cooper laments ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder about our place in the stars now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dirt."" But lo and behold NASA exists after all; its just gone underground. Under the auspices of wise old Professor Brand (Michael Caine) the agency is secretly resurrecting its efforts to find a new home for Earthlings with the suitably named Lazarus mission. The path to it Brand explains is through a wormhole visible near Saturn and plenty of technical dialogue and physical demonstrations are devoted to detailing how the astronauts will slip through this envelope in space and emerge in a different galaxy near another planet that might support life as we know it (eminent theoretical physicist Kip Thorne receives executive producer credit for his contributions to this and other astronomical aspects of the story). See more Interstellar Inside THRs Roundtable With Christopher Nolan and Matthew McConaughey Cooper cannot resist the invitation to pilot this secret mission but the angst of having to leave his family behind specifically Murph gives him the emotional bends. ""Im coming back"" he gravely intones echoing The Terminator but even if he does return it seems that on the other side he and his crew will age at just a fraction of the rate that Earthlings do at home. Murph is inconsolable and single-mindedly remains so for years. Nolan employs a nifty little homage to 2001 at the 43-minute mark with an abrupt time-jumping cut from Coopers pickup truck speeding away from his house to the fiery blast-off of his rocket. Other editing ploys emphasize the complete silence of outer space which provide a sharp contrast to a soundtrack otherwise filled with lots of talk and Hans Zimmers often soaring sometimes domineering and unconventionally orchestrated wall-of-sound score. See more Matthew McConaugheys Diverse Film Resume From Dazed and Confused to Interstellar The small crew also consists of Brands oddly guarded scientist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) thoughtful astrophysicist Romilly (David Gyasi in an intriguingly underplayed performance that makes you wish he had more to do) insufficiently written scientist and co-pilot Doyle (Wes Bentley) and last but not least the mobile computerized robot TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin) an occasionally humorous cross between Hal and R2D2. What goes on among the astronauts is not especially interesting and Amelia in particular remains an annoyingly vague and unpersuasive character in contrast to McConaugheys exuberant if regret-laden mission leader a role the actor invests with vigor and palpable feeling. Its a two-year trip out to Saturn during which the crew hibernates in whats cleverly called ""the long nap"" (a perfect title for a short story version of The Big Sleep) prior to the rough ride through the hole. Perhaps the most implausible detail in the entire film is that even from another galaxy a degree of communication with home is possible. But 23 Earth years have passed meaning that Murph is now in her 30s and is played by Jessica Chastain. Shes just as resentful of her father having abandoned her as she ever was--its a refrain thats seriously overplayed--while Amelia is gratified to learn that her dad who looked 80ish when they left is still alive. See more Christopher Nolans Filmography Interstellar Dark Knight and 7 Others What happens once they arrive on a barren snowy but not entirely inhospitable rock is best left undisclosed even if the identity of a surprise presence there of a previous voyager wont remain a secret for long. But aside from 2001 which is obliquely referenced again in a late-on cutaway to an ancient Cooper lying in bed in a sterile room the landmark sci-fi film that Interstellar intriguingly echoes is the 1956 Forbidden Planet; both involve a follow-up journey to a planet in a different galaxy where humans have previously landed and intensely dwell upon a father-daughter relationship. But while the double use of this parent-child bond suggests the great importance of this theme to Nolan and represents a legitimate and rare attempt to emotionalize sci-fi the issue is over-stressed in a narrow manner. Murphs persistent anger at her father is essentially her only character trait and becomes tiresome; shes a closed-off character. Her brother played as an adult by Casey Affleck remains too thinly developed to offer a substantial contrast to her attitude. For all its adventurous and far-seeing aspects Interstellar remains rather too rooted in Earthly emotions and scientific reality to truly soar and venture into the unknown the truly dangerous. Startling at times it never confronts the terror of the infinite and nothingness no matter how often the dialogue cites the spectre of a ""ghost"" or how many times we hear Dylan Thomass ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" and its famous ""Rage rage against the dying of the light."" Read more The Hollywood Reporter in Focus Interstellar to Air on PBS in NYC and Southern California Interstellar optimistically and humanistically proposes that even if the light is slowly dying in one place a reasonable facsimile might be found as a substitute. But theres no rage here just a healthy belief in mid-20th century-style Yankee gumption and a can-do attitude. Whether thats enough anymore is another question.

Until it isnt To paraphrase Christopher Nolans ""The Dark Knight"" we dont get the prestige filmmakers we need we get the ones we deserve. And one of the ones we seemingly deserve is Nolan himself a filmmaker with a keen visual sense but also one who undercuts the big challenging ideas of his movies with unnecessarily tidy resolutions. See video Matthew McConaughey Must Choose His Daughter or All of Humanity in Latest Interstellar Trailers (Video) In that respect ""Interstellar"" may represent an apotheosis of sorts as it illustrates the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director. On the plus side theres a stunning portrayal of how far-reaching space travel might work a glimpse at an apocalyptic near-future thats both brilliantly written (no year is mentioned and were left to glean together important bits of information that zip by in conversation) and designed (the clothes the cars and the tech are almost entirely late-20th century) and a vision of robots like nothing Ive ever seen in a movie. Weighing against that without getting into spoilers is a third act of staggering wrongheadedness along with female characters whose intellect takes a backseat to their exploding emotionalism and rage. Nolan is presumably among a handful of filmmakers who gets to do whatever he wants with minimal studio intrusion but the resolution of ""Interstellar"" feels so inorganic that youd swear it was concocted by a Glendale focus group. See photos Inside Matthew McConaugheys Cinematheque Night All His Female Co-Stars Still Love Him (Photos) That ending feels like such a betrayal because so much of what comes before it manages to be truly stunning particularly in the 70mm IMAX version thanks to the art department the visual effects team and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (""Her""). We open with interviews with elderly Midwesterners remembering crop failure and wind storms and they would appear to be talking about the Dust Bowl of the 1930s until we see a table being set where someone dusts off a plate a glass -- and a laptop computer. In this retro-future we meet Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) one of the last pilots to work at NASA before the agency was dissolved since the lack of food on Earth took priority over reaching the stars. The widowed Coop runs a family farm with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) son Tom (Timothee Chalamet ""Men Women and Children"") and daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy ""The Conjuring""). Also read Interstellar Big Hero 6 Tracking for Blockbuster 60 Million Box Office Openings The latter is convinced that there are ghosts in her room knocking objects off shelves and sending her messages via Morse code. Coop is skeptical until he realizes that lines of dust left on her floor after a windstorm are actually binary code giving the coordinates to what turns out to be the very last NASA base where Coops old mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) is overseeing a launch to track down three previous missions that were intended to find a new home for the human race. Coop must leave behind his family including a very upset Murph for the mission accompanied by Brands daughter (Anne Hathaway) two other astronauts and the sarcastic and boxy (but surprisingly versatile) android TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin). All the setup is fascinating as is the space travel particularly when they journey to planets near a black hole meaning that for every hour that the landing party spends on the surface seven years will elapse for the crew member orbiting in the spacecraft. Cliffhanger sequences involving slow giant tidal waves and docking with an out-of-control ship demonstrate the directors (and editor Lee Smiths) proficiency. For much of the film Nolan (who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan) seems to be unafraid to allow this big-budget extravaganza to tell a story thats about pain and loss and melancholy and sacrifice. Until its not that anymore and ""Interstellar"" becomes thuddingly prosaic. Worse Hathaway and Jessica Chastain (as adult Murphy) both get saddled playing brilliant women who are nonetheless ruled by their you know lady feelings before ultimately capitulating to the men around them even though the men arent that stable themselves. (A movie about traveling to the ends of the universe only to find daddy issues? Didnt McConaughey already make that movie and wasnt it called ""Contact""?) Also read Christopher Nolans Interstellar Explodes at Intimate First-Look Screening Nolan also seemingly cant help himself from drowning out many of the dialogue scenes with ribcage-jiggling bass notes from pipe organs and string sections which basically try to do for ""Interstellar"" what ""bwaaaaahhh"" did for ""Inception."" ""Interstellar"" is a film that isnt afraid to brush up against the edges of infinity; its just too bad it has no idea how to navigate the voyage back. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The result is a two-pronged blockbuster comprised of smarts and sentimentalism like nothing else out there -- not perfect but expertly crafted and wholly satisfying unlike so many movies made a similar scale today. The Basics Despite narrative details that might require a science degree for full comprehension the actual premise of ""Interstellar"" is relatively straightforward In a near future where Earths ecosystem steadily falls apart the planets farmers find their crops steadily dying out hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. Its during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist (Michael Caine sage-like and sleepy-eyed per usual) to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole--possibly put there by some mysterious form of life--to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. READ MORE Jessica Chastain is Slumming It and Loving It NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them the professors feisty daughter Brand (Anne Hathaway) continually challenges Coopers confidence while a low key physicist (David Gyasi) helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group smart-alecky robot TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin)--basically a giant talking iPad with legs--marks the rare instance of levity in Nolans oeuvre even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companions humor setting. Theres no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula but theyve been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something. Leaving his family behind Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away his science-obsessed daughter Murph (Jessica Chastain) grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow and its their underlying simplicity that give the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose. A Big Bag of Tricks Of course this being a Christopher Nolan movie its never really that simple. Ever since his non-linear sophomore effort ""Memento"" Nolan has excelled at a labyrinthine approach to filmmaking in which seemingly every narrative ingredient forms one piece of a tantalizing puzzle. While his three Batman movies obscured that talent ""Interstellar"" allows it to shine where it belongs -- in a narrative practically designed for tricky logic. Even as the story barrels ahead into extrasolar environments made of ice giant waves the pratfalls of wormholes and gravitational singularities ""Interstellar"" bolsters its plot to genuine character motivation and the continuing impression that everything adds up to...something. And it does. Co-written with his brother Jonathan and consultation from theoretical physicist Kip Thorne ""Interstellar"" eventually finds Cooper and his colleagues in a distant solar system on the brink of a black hole which means that time gets funky Visiting one planet they lose decades of Earth time over the course of a disastrous three-hour trip -- which means that once back on the ship Cooper must get caught up on years of messages from his family back home. Cross-cutting between deep space and increasingly dire events on Earth Nolan embraces a strategy akin to ""Inception"" in which one layer of events regularly comments on the other to absorbing effect. The difference is that while the structure of ""Inception"" spoke to the layers of consciousness at the center of its plot it serves a more affecting purpose. While Murph and her brother Tom (Casey Affleck) struggle to make peace with their fathers absence over the course of decades Cooper experiences a single challenging operation in much less time never quite certain if anything productive will come of it. The result is a movie at once dense with information and rich with feeling a rare combo in the blockbuster arena that merges its technical achievements with a tenderness. Aided by Hans Zimmers energizing score -- a far more colorful effort than the intentionally abrasive ones found in earlier Nolan collaborations--""Interstellar"" is Nolans most well-rounded movie to date. Its three-hour running time never drags. After some 45 minutes of exposition the journey through the wormhole doesnt disappoint and theres much more to come When Matt Damon surfaces around the two-hour mark as another interplanetary explorer with information that takes the plot in further unexpected directions there are numerous twists just around the corner. But their appeal owes less to the surprise factor than the directors nimble ability to fit them in with the movies galvanizing themes of human survival against the threat of extinction. More Traditional Than Meets the Eye Though its sweeping vision of the cosmos invites comparisons to ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" the legacy of Stanley Kubricks mind-bending achievement remains secure. Despite its epic scope ""Interstellar"" delivers a traditional payoff. Considering its basic set of events one could easily envision a more straightforward version of the movie guided to fruition by the likes of Steven Spielberg--or Robert Zemeckis whose ""Contact"" is the blatant antecedent of the soul-searching hard science combo on display here. However the Nolans have never shown the same mastery of characters that they have for situations. Much of the blunt dialogue strains from simple melodrama (including a prolonged monologue about love) and incredulous exclamations about outrageous plot that might sound more at home on an episode of ""Star Trek."" In one outrageous moment the physicist uses a pen and paper to explain the dynamics of a wormhole to Cooper moments before he flies them into it -- as if the briefing session never happened once in the two years it took for them to get there. For a movie with such a spectacular plot ""Interstellar"" strains from such elementary moments (look out for the hints of a romantic subplot that never goes anywhere maybe because the filmmakers just lost interest after a while). READ MORE Six Reasons Why Interstellar Isnt a Best Picture Slam Dunk But these are minor concerns in a movie so visually masterful and rich with ideas. ""Interstellar"" eventually derives its emotional undertones from the way it uses the passage of time. Its as much a movie about time travel as space travel though anyone with a working knowledge of the theory of relativity should understand that those ingredients are always connected. Nolan has done his homework applying realistic ingredients to an exciting and profound outcome. A Grand Scale Outside of those virtues ""Interstellar"" still delivers in purely visceral terms with Nolans attention to scale always in play. While staging action has never been his strong suit here the director crafts a number of extraordinarily thrilling sequences in which otherworldly ingredients take on palpable menace His renderings of giant interplanetary waves and frozen clouds create a real sense of being lost in ominous environments beyond the realm of expectations. Cinematographer Hoyt Van Hoytema and effects company Double Negative imbue these scenes with a rich expansive quality that speaks to the range of space being covered. The scenes in space never muster the same level of sheer excitement found in last years ""Gravity"" but when objects explode without sound or spin rapidly out of control its clear that Nolans working hard to render events as they might actually happen. The ""wow"" factor comes equipped with brains. Still ""Interstellar"" is held together by McConaugheys credible turn which has more in common with his subdued role on ""True Detective"" than his usual snarky routine. Hathaways strong-willed character lacks the same dimensionality but she does her best with the material. However its Chastain who really delivers as a woman at once furious with her father and inexplicably drawn to help him from across the universe. Their formidable performances ground ""Interstellar"" in a plot that without such credible elements in play might seem more at home on ""The Twilight Zone."" Instead ""Interstellar"" makes its far-reaching concept utterly believable right down to an outrageous climax that stretches across time and space with bursts of psychedelic imagery that still winds up making sense. In its final scenes ""Interstellar"" struggles to bring every piece in play to a tidy conclusion but its comforting to watch Nolan give it a shot. Many Movies at Once The timing of ""Interstellar"" caps a great period of science fiction cinema. The past 12 months have seen the release of not only ""Gravity"" but also the hard science travelogue ""The Europa Report"" (which in retrospect plays like ""Interstellar""-lite) as well as the multidimensional dinner party comedy ""Coherence"" which also uses real physics in the service of outrageous entertainment. ""Interstellar"" consolidates the appeal of all these movies into a singularly engaging package. Its a movie engineered to advertise its genres innate appeal. That Nolan can do so much with such a grand canvas and studio money shows the extent to which he has managed to carve out a niche in the industry. Brainy and exciting at the same time ""Interstellar"" invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product.  No matter its shortcomings the movie achieves an impressive balancing act. It turns the mysteries of the universe into a cinematic playground but for every profound or visually arresting moment it also encourages you to to think. Grade B+ ""Interstellar"" opens nationwide on November 5.

I dont care if they bombed this movie Im still going to see it. Reply Stergios May 12 2016 813 pm Really good review. Im dying to watch the film and I strongly believe we need ambitious thought-provoking and complex films whatever flaws they may even have. Im sure Jessica Chastain steals the whole show even with a small but clearly pivotal part. Just give this incredible woman the Oscar shes ridiculously overdue for already Reply Jack May 12 2016 813 pm why would you spoil matt damons role. You ruined a huge twist for the audience.

Where Gravity was brief contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination Interstellar is long grand strange and demanding - not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes. Its a bold beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike and yet it always feels grounded in its own deadly serious reality. Its hard to talk about the story without ruining its slow drip of surprises. So lets be vague. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives with his family - his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and two young kids - in a not-too-distant future where living off huge fields of corn is the only business around. Dust storms brew and theres an apocalyptic vibe as if the Depression of the 1930s had been transplanted to a dying Earth. Cooper has a strong bond with his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). But when this former pilot is given a chance to head a mission into space he grabs it. Its all very Messianic. This rough-and-ready everymans destiny is to join a secret project to save the Earth directed by the ageing Professor Brand (Michael Caine). And so he blasts into orbit in the company of Brands daughter (Anne Hathaway) and two other scientists (Wes Bentley David Gyasi). This is no bus hop to the Moon their aim is to slip through a wormhole near Saturn and search for other planets capable of sustaining life. Lets just say that their return ticket is flexible. You might understand the science (influenced by the involvement of physicist Kip Thorne) but the chances are you wont. Yet still Interstellar inspires trust and all the formulae and ample talk of wormholes is best taken as mood music. Also despite the cosmic canvas Interstellar is still one of the most earthbound films to date from Nolan and the one most in tune with its emotions. Even with Nolans early hit Memento (2000) before he took on The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012) and Inception (2010) we knew we were exploring fairly chilly movie worlds. Nolan is ably assisted in this respect by a cast you can believe in. The real star is McConaughey his earthy grit and family-man vulnerability are well placed we believe his tears when the reality of multi-decade space travel sets in. Meanwhile the father-daughter relationship between Caine and Hathaway hits home with a sharp brutality. And brutal is the word this is a sharp tense experience. There are some staggering visual coups an ocean rising up to form the largest wave imaginable; a space ship floating past the rings of Saturn; a late scene which turns our perceptions of space and time on their head. But alongside these thrills are moments of intense danger and Nolan makes us feel the threat honing in on mechanical problems and other everyday risks. Parallels to Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey are more than obvious; theyre ingrained were invited to wonder at staggering imagery and listen to unnerving silence as well as Hans Zimmers organ-heavy score. Nolan even offers his own spin on Kubricks HAL 9000 by giving us a shiny walking robot thats by far the cutest thing on display. But where Interstellar is more Spielberg than Kubrick is in the strained family relationships at its heart. Yet the final tone is all Nolans the films devastating emotional strands refuse to give way to empty sentiment and are embedded in a fractured sense of a nightmare unfolding before the eyes. Youre better advised to come armed with an encyclopaedia not a hankie although in a seriously imaginative climactic scene - almost impossible to explain - science and sorrow are powerfully united. Often when we talk about cinema being a ride were hinting at a lack of substance an absence of ideas an opportunity to switch off. Not so here. Interstellar is in large part a spectacle. But it also asks you to think hard look hard and urges you to return for more. Why only ask for the stars when you can have moons distant planets extra dimensions lectures on physics and a sobering shot of terror? Interstellar has it all.

Ill forgive them ignoring black hole spaghettification and recommend this must see film. I also liked the subtext that global warming will destroy the world slowly but surely for our children and the baby boomer era will be reviled by the future generations facing extinction.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 9 20141 of 1 found helpfulMatt GFeaturedI saw this film yesterday with my family including a daughter who sometimes fails to follow plots very well so I was nervous about taking her to a long complicated film.  As the credits rolled I turned to her and asked well?.  She replied That was amazing  And that really sums it up all 4 of us absolutely loved it.  Driving home we caught a radio 4 discussion of it that really didnt like it and we were all yelling insults at the radio.....I am a science nerd and I confess that occasionally I was irritated by something I knew to be wrong but it was fleeting and utterly subsumed by the spectacle and the story the effects and the emotions.  I have read reviews criticising the dialogue but none of it grated with me.  In summary this was a film that blew away 2 40 something cynics and 2 CGI saturated teens and left us all feeling we had seen something immense.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 25 2014critique _Featured Engrossing science fiction drama not quite the masterpiece that  most critics have declared it to be but impressive cinema nonetheless.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 15 2014cinephileFeaturedInterstellar looks impressive and sounds profound. Somehow though the heart of this film is as cold as the space into which it projects its cast. It doesnt matter if they save the world; its if they make us care.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 7 2014Norman LFeaturedZimmer and Nolan together again .Irresistable. Saw the movie today amp; was completely satisfied on all fronts. A steal for a 7.50 cinema ticket.Go see it soonHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 30 2014Cookie MonstermoderatorFeaturedWow A truly magnificent epic.Stunning at the IMAX.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 30 20140 of 1 found helpfulDillip MFeaturedJust seen it - a bum-aching bore wanted to leave. Flabbergasted at the gushing reviews Losing my trust in Time Out after this one. Its all because Christopher Nolan is hip and has a name never mind hes made an overlong turkey of a film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 28 20140 of 1 found helpfulAndrew RFeaturedJust one of the worst movies I have ever seen - frankly SciFi channel is better. Bloated self-indulgent incoherent mawkish drivel. Average special effects and sub average performances. You could drive a space station through the plot holes and still get it mired in the appalling dialogue. My girlfriend was asking if we could leave after about half an hour.I gritted my teeth to see how it ended and spent the last 45 minutes just begging for it to be over. Rarely have I seen a film so utterly devoid of any redeeming features.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/interstellar,200,interstellar49,interstellar,timeout
