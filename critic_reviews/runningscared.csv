Its a question hanging over Wayne Kramers follow-up to The Cooler a relentlessly excessive gangland thriller clearly channelling the stone-cold amorality of early-70s crime flicks (Prime Cut say or Across 110th St) but the writer-directors penchant for extremes ultimately proves the films undoing. It starts with the bloodbath of a bungled drugs rendezvous leaving mob underling Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker trying hard) to dump a pistol which offed a dodgy cop. Which of course he doesnt do since hes stashing weapons in his New Jersey garage as an insurance policy for his young family. Big mistake. Oleg (Cameron Bright) son of the abusive Russian immigrant next door has had enough of his addled ex-Mafioso dad shoots him with the very same piece and disappears into the night.The idea presumably is how we create our own hell through misguided good intentions or imprinting violent solutions on the impressionable young. Sadly the dizzying plot soon loses track of such whys and wherefores in favour of the short-term buzz of another twist while its hard to square underlying compassion with the callous brutality on show - by the time someones had their ear chewed off we hardly bat an eyelid. Most troubling though is the degree of gun-toting action that Oleg is exposed to and participates in not to mention a cameo appearance by two sadistic child killers. With audiences jaded by the usual sex and splatter do the filmmakers have no qualms about juicing up proceedings with edgy but troubling material which clearly needs more conscientious handling? Apparently not.

The violence here is definitely not an attempt to describe any gangster -milieu it is purely exploitative to such a degree that as the film progresses you simply stop caring about any of the characters- there is anyway no character development at all- and think (or even wish) they could as well all die in a final gigantic bloodbath. For what affects the wannabe stylisitc Tarantino-like effects they are totally far-fetched unrealistic and repetitive. Another point ruining this disaster of a film is that it takes itself seriously. And of course there are these AWFULLY BORING dialogues with the occurence of the word fuck either in its verbal or in its adjectival form in about 90% of the sentences uttered. For what affects the rest of those dialogues they switch to truly laughable with for instance Joey Gazelles wife telling him I know youre not an evil man I know I didnt marry an evil person or later on speaking of the paedophiles You know I saw the evil incarnate. What a flattering comparison from part of his wife. To sum up and Mr Kramer should not be offended to hear that since I am borrowing straight from the dialogues of his flick this is a totally fucked-up film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/83331.html,200,runningscared0,runningscared,timeout

Wayne Kramers repellent little thriller ""Running Scared"" is two hours long but if you removed every word that I cant repeat in this paper itd probably be about 20 minutes. Paul Walker as unfortunate mob flunky Joey Gazelle uses the F-word repeatedly in every sentence and sometimes just stands still and shrieks it to the skies; its as if hes auditioning for a David Mamet movie. This may well be how mobsters talk and its probably intended to make the normally mellow Walker seem like a tough guy but its just sloppy lazy writing. You tune out Joey pretty quickly but unfortunately theres nothing else in this movie to listen to except the gunshots. But there is much to look at kids pointing guns at people kids being threatened with knives kids being beaten by pimps a woman having her head bashed against the side of a car men shooting each other in the crotch a man biting anothers ear off (in extreme close-up) countless guns and bullets and gallons of blood some of which takes place in scenes so dimly lit that you cant tell whos shooting who. All of this is in service to an outlandish story that has nothing to say except that mob flunkies really should keep their guns in places where kids cant get to them. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Running Scared"" with Paul Walker Cameron Bright Karel Roden Chazz Palminteri Vera Farmiga Alex Neuberger. Written and directed by Wayne Kramer. 119 minutes. Rated R for pervasive strong brutal violence and language sexuality and drug content. Several theaters. Kramer whose 2003 Vegas noir ""The Cooler"" showed that hes perfectly capable of creating a film rich in character and atmosphere appears to have fallen down some sort of violent-movie rabbit-hole here. The camera zooms and twitches and even turns upside-down for no particular reason; bullets zing backward and forward and hang in the air like a video game made large. Theres little room for character in this fast-paced story Joey must race through the night in search of his 10-year-old neighbor Oleg (Cameron Bright) who has run off with a gun used in a cop shooting. Infinite complications ensue and a lot of people get killed most of them bad guys. This would all be instantly dismissible except for one factor that makes ""Running Scared"" stand out There is a child at the center of this ultraviolent story and the devices used to keep us on tenterhooks regarding his survival are appallingly manipulative. For example after young Oleg has fled the scary homeless drug dealer and fought off the violent pimp he jumps into the back of a random van while trying to escape his abusive meth-addicted Russian-mob-connected stepfather -- and it turns out to be a van owned by a pair of child pornographers. And did I mention that the kid has asthma? Bright whos made creepy films into something of a specialty (hes starred in ""Birth"" ""Godsend"" and ""The Butterfly Effect"" among others) is a sullen-looking child actor with intense focused eyes; you get the feeling this kid could stare down a cobra if need be. But surely there are better things for a person his age to be doing -- and better things for people of any age to be watching.

Starring Paul Walker in a confident new vein as a lowly mobster desperate to protect his family this nasty little number offers a harrowing descent into a New Jersey underworld replete with hoods hookers and hot merchandise. A ferociously energetic piece of filmmaking ""Running Scared"" makes the seedy Vegas milieu of writer-director Wayne Kramers first feature ""The Cooler"" look as tasteful as ""The Sound of Music."" Starring Paul Walker in a confident new vein as a lowly mobster desperate to protect his family this nasty little number offers a harrowing descent into a New Jersey underworld replete with hoods hookers and hot merchandise. Potent low-budget acquisition should perform solidly for New Line though the extreme violence and aggressively sordid atmosphere will test audience limits. Like ""The Cooler"" Kramers sophomore effort tells an earnest love story wrapped in sleazy ambience albeit pitched at a much higher and more frightening level of intensity. Pic is dedicated to Sam Peckinpah Brian De Palma and Walter Hill and it boasts enough graphic bloodshed sinuous camerawork and robust genre smarts to warrant the gesture. A botched drug deal involving the Italian Perello mob triggers the breathless opening shootout which ends with the death of a dirty cop. Low-level Perello operator Joey Gazelle (Walker) is ordered to quickly dispose of the snub-nosed revolver used in the killing a task thats easier said than done. Upon returning home to his loving wife Teresa (Vera Farmiga) Joey stashes the hot revolver in the basement an act witnessed by his young son Nicky (Alex Neuberger) and Nickys neighbor friend Oleg (Cameron Bright). Olegs family -- abusive John Wayne-obsessed stepfather Anzor (Karel Roden) and quietly suffering mother Mila (Ivana Milicevic) -- are introduced in a tense beautifully paced and shot sequence that whooshes back and forth between the two houses in a series of bravura tracking shots. Set piece culminates with Oleg using the hidden revolver to shoot his stepfather and then escaping into the night. This throws Joey into a panic not only because the gun is out in the open but because Anzor is a member of the Russian Yugorsky mob which has shady dealings of its own with Perello clan chief Frankie (Arthur Nascarella). Conflict between Joeys dual identities as expert assassin and devoted family man -- as well as his need to shield Nicky and Oleg from corruption -- at times suggests a latter-day ""Road to Perdition"" but plays out with less pretension and considerably more pulpy vigor. Still theres no denying that viewers not prepared for the relentless stream of nasty personalities profane invective and bone-crunching violence are in for a very long sit. Walker (currently onscreen in ""Eight Below"") anchors the proceedings with perhaps his most authoritative and sustained leading-man perf to date though his macho anguish at times borders on one-note. Continuing her ascent following her breakthrough turn in ""Down to the Bone"" Farmiga proves more than Walkers match playing Teresa as a sexy tender yet highly formidable mother lion. But its 13-year-old Bright -- possessed of the same unnerving inquietude he displayed in ""Birth"" -- who best dramatizes the storys concern for the plight of endangered children. The scenes unfolding from his perspective have a nightmarishly surreal ""Wizard of Oz"" quality that at times defies explanation. Pics most gripping sequence seems to come out of nowhere a shockingly creepy episode that sees Oleg held captive by a devious married couple (Bruce Altman and Elizabeth Mitchell). Nothing that follows is nearly as intriguing least of all the graphic final showdown between the Perellos and the Yugorskys. Concluding reel though it delivers the necessary emotional wrap-up feels implausible and tacked-on. Sexual frankness is one of Kramers calling cards as a director and while it lacks ""The Coolers"" full-frontal daring pic is far more revealing than most mainstream fare. Somewhat more disturbingly helmers fondness for scenes focusing on the abuse and humiliation of women -- albeit in ways that invite sympathy rather than contempt -- is again very much in evidence. James Whitakers cinematography relying heavily on Steadicam and crane shots dazzles with a desaturated palette that nevertheless has a rich grimy luster. Arthur Coburns hyperkinetic editing makes deft use of jump cuts split-second fast-forwards and rewinds while Mark Ishams arrestingly off-kilter score plays a crucial role in keeping auds unnerved. That the film is set in New Jersey but was shot largely in Prague only compounds the oddity of the project.

Starring Paul Walker Vera Farmiga and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Wayne Kramer. (R. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Running Scared"" is for people who like movies who dont need to have a movie mean something in order to enjoy it and who can delight at the sheer craft of a story designed only to shock amuse and hold an audience. Its the kind of film not usually held in high esteem by critics -- unless its played for irony or comes from Asia -- but its not easy to make or everyone would do it Its a pumped-up intricate and fast-moving yarn that never flags and continues to play out in unexpected ways as it unravels. The word ""yarn"" is appropriate -- its the word the great midcentury director Samuel Fuller used for his stories which he crafted to grab viewers immediately by the lapels shake them bang them against the walls the floor and the ceiling and not let go until the finish. Fuller is the closest reference point for ""Running Scared"" with its environment of urban squalor and its cast of vivid B-team actors. Writer-director Wayne Kramer operates here out of a pre-Tarantino mentality when it was still possible to present violent over-the-top melodrama without turning it into an in-joke. Kramer shows the rewards of playing it straight. The tone is set early. In the first scene hoods are counting some loot when masked bandits barge in. Within seconds 10 guys are blasting at each other with high-powered weapons in a room no bigger than a childs bedroom. Theyre cursing howling and slipping on blood in a scene of breathtaking excess carnage and murderous aggression. Its a useful scene in that it announces the filmmakers audacity and gives viewers the chance to decide if they want to stay or get their money back. In the aftermath of the bloodbath Joey (Paul Walker) a low-level player in an Italian crime family is given a simple assignment -- to dispose of a gun used to fight off the bandits. But instead of going off immediately to throw it in the ocean somewhere he does what anybody else would do. He goes home relaxes has sex with his wife (Vera Farmiga) and sits down to a nice pasta dinner. Hes one relaxed fellow because he doesnt know that the 10-year-old boy next door has stolen this very hot gun. He has no idea until he hears a shot and finds out that the boy has used it to shoot his stepfather. The stepfather had it coming. The above counts for about 12 minutes of this two-hour movie. From here pandemonium ensues and keeps ensuing Joey has to find the kid and retrieve the gun. But the cops led by a corrupt detective (Chazz Palminteri) are also after the gun and so is the mob. Our hero has one problem and the story has one focus but its a good one If he doesnt find the gun and dispose of it hes either going to be arrested or dead by morning. This concentrates his energies. Such a set-up could have resulted in something mundane were it not for Kramers abandon and his willingness to pile on and keep following his imagination as well as his showmans instinct. He never lets the story retreat regroup or redirect but keeps going for broke. It further helps that the character relationships though not deep are specific enough that their fate is not a matter of indifference. Its clear for example that Joey and his wife have a vigorous loving relationship married all those years and still getting amorous on top of the washing machine. For Walker who just a few years ago seemed like a competent pretty boy this is his official graduation into his 30s which are not as cute as ones 20s but a lot more scruffy and interesting. Farmiga makes a strong impression as his alluring but down-to-earth wife and the scenes that follow her exploits are as jammed with incident as any in the film. In fact an argument could be made that the movies most memorable sequence belongs to her. Kramer who wrote and directed ""The Cooler"" has a screwy imagination and hes right to trust it. Occasionally it takes him into the realm of obvious silliness -- a Russian characters speech about his love for John Wayne has the whiff of the word processor about it. But for the most part it takes him and his audience into remarkable places. Its probable that critics and serious filmgoers will not properly appreciate ""Running Scared"" because its aspirations are narrow at least according to a certain standard. Its not a deep cry of the heart or a statement on the human condition and it doesnt innovate or advance the art of movies. It aspires only to entertain -- a generous aspiration not a narrow one -- and it succeeds resoundingly. -- Advisory Nonstop cursing pockets of graphic violence sexual situations erotic dancing and full-frontal nudity (female).

Though its rating is the hardest of Rs few films try as hard to be commercial. In exploiting our love-hate for whack-attack mobsters Running Scared pushes more buttons about violence and sex than Crash jabs about racism. Written and directed by Wayne Kramer with slavish imitations of Tony Scott the film has style for miles. But Running Scared does more than run. Shot in stark washed-out tones like Scotts recent Domino it zips darts and shaky-cams the viewer to a point of disorientation perhaps to distract us from its thin characters and utter preposterousness. But even beyond its sleazy pandering and sensationalism the films worst transgression is its exploitation of young children. Heres a movie that suddenly introduces murderous pedophiles in hopes viewers will cheer for them to be blown away yet also uses innocent children for its own grim purposes turning 10-year-olds into eager assailants -- even gun-toting berserkers. One is the son of Walkers New Jersey family guy/wiseguy. Another is the son of a heinous hardened Russian living -- and cooking drugs -- next door. When the second kid shoots his dad in self-defense using a hot gun from a mob killing Walker must get it back. What ensues is an all-nighter of ultraviolent encounters and absurd coincidences with the kids dragged along and getting in harms way. Thats not to say the film lacks visceral impact or guilty-pleasure appeal. Much of its action is creatively staged and the cast gets the overheated job done. A blustery Walker chews scenery ravenously yet shows the proper ferocity while Vera Farmiga as his game wife grounds the film in motherly concern. Assorted hit men and brutish bosses embody the mobs mix of ruthless savagery and businesslike expedience. Twisted humor lightens the darkness but not all of it seems intentional. Running Scared can be downright goofy for a real-world action film. With such giddy outrageousness Running Scared seems as frightened of failure as its protagonist. Doing anything to get our attention it races recklessly from rationality or compassion to a point where lurid sensation is all that matters. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals PUMA at eBay for Deals from 2 + free shipping 10x30-Foot Gazebo Tent Canopy for 75 + free shipping Sinwood Indoor Electric UV Insect Zapper for 29 + free shipping Original Penguin Mens Leather Wallet for 15 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Every once in a while you walk out of a movie thinking to yourself ""Wow. Thats really messed up."" ""Running Scared"" will do that to you. Heres why A 10-year-old boy at the heart of the story shoots his wife-beating stepdad watches a prostitute assaulted by her pimp and is kidnapped by child pornographers who dismember their victims after filming. Thats just for starters. Elsewhere in the story the boy is forced at gunpoint to pull a bag of heroin syringes from a toilet watch an informant get shot through the head and see his only protector held prone on the ice while hockey players slap-shot pucks at his head. Running home to his mothers arms he finds the lawn on fire from an explosion in Mom and Dads backyard meth lab. Perhaps I seem humorless about all this. You should know the part where the auto mechanics crotch is lit on fire with his own welding torch had me smiling on the inside. That hockey rink finale of ""Running Scared"" ends in the shooting deaths of at least eight New Jersey goombahs. Or maybe it was 10 - I forget how many players are on a side these international rules are so confusing. Writer-director Wayne Kramer shoots it like a zombie movie .... ""Night of the Living Enforcer""? Confusion reigns in ""Running Scared."" (I had to think for a moment about that unfortunate auto mechanic momentarily mixing him up with a cop who also was damaged in the groinal region.) Primarily my confusion is what the heck happened to Kramer whose initial effort ""The Cooler"" was a delightful intelligent Vegas romp and a favorite at the 2004 Denver film festival. Here Kramer has written a hellish hybrid crossing ""Goodfellas"" with ""After Hours"" or ""The Sopranos"" with ""Saw II."" Paul Walker plays Joey Gazelle a good family man whose commute home one day is interrupted by a drug buy resulting in at least six deaths. Being a mob errand boy Joey agrees to hide the guns. His kid and the neighbor find the guns and put one of them to good use shooting the neighbors evil stepdad. Then the gun goes missing Joeys in big trouble with the made men and after that its all snub-nose pimps and nickel-plated hookers. You may have heard unkind references to New Jersey as a toilet stall. But I can guarantee you will not again see so many of New Jerseys actual toilet stalls depicted in a movie. When wayward child confronts the stepdad he shot he says ""Im sorry. Im sorry I missed."" Gets you right there in the ulcer doesnt it? Kramer has tried to soften the 400 F-bomb blows of his odd creation by claiming its a modern Grimm fairy tale; Joey and the boys (Cameron Bright and Alex Neuberger) go ""through the looking glass"" into a nightmarish underworld. Please in the name of all profanity dont take that to mean the kids should come along and bring their favorite plush toy. ""Running Scared"" is about as hard an ""R"" rating as you can get with buckets of blood full- frontal nudity and swearing that would peel gum from the sidewalk. Even in Hoboken.

"Depressing Scared is running on empty - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Depressing Scared is running on empty By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 24 2006 Once in a while Ill sit in the dark of a movie theater rapt with awe. Did that 10-year-old boy just call John Wayne a slur worse than pansy? Did he just shoot his Russian stepfather in the shoulder? Well yeah but only after the druggy stepfather walloped the boys ex-prostitute mom.The wonders never cease in Running Scared"" a depressing piece of gun-crazy Hollywood scuzz that with its gassy style and runaway immorality makes a Tony Scott movie look like a Robert Bresson picture.The 10-year-old here is a dour hockey enthusiast named Oleg (Cameron Bright) and the snub-nose revolver he just fired belongs to medium-time New Jersey hoods. They include Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker) who spends the movie chasing the boy for the gun which Oleg got while playing in Joeys basement with his son Nicky (Alex Neuberger).Normally if youve seen one grimy over-cranked movie that appears to have been shot edited directed and acted on a copious supply of Red Bull youve seen them all. What ensues in Running Scared"" almost needs to be seen to be believed.Oleg and Nicky get mixed up in a world of grisly doings and nonstop expletives. That could have been dark fun but writer-director Wayne Kramer (The Cooler"") manages to douse their adventure in woeful cliches the most needless of which is Chazz Palminteri in another oily detective role.For one 15-minute stretch though Running Scared"" breaks character and turns morally inspired when one of Olegs countless excursions takes him to the home of a cheery couple (Elizabeth Mitchell and Bruce Altman) who perpetrate terrible acts on kids. Desperate the boy calls Joeys wife (Vera Farmiga) who comes to the rescue with an electrifying all-too-momentary diversion from the jingoism misogyny racism and homophobia on display.Farmiga gets our adrenaline going and walks off with the picture playing the one character with a moral compass and a scintilla of righteous common sense. Plus she seems like the only person in the movie who could be from New Jersey.Walkers part is a Mark Wahlberg special but he doesnt have Walhbergs seductive thuggishness. After Into the Deep"" and Eight Below"" the actor seemed to be hitting his stride as a mellowed dreamboat. Here he goes psychopathic and leans hard on the F-word as though that were the only way he could justify his measly Garden State accent.The two younger actors are sorely inexpressive. I beat up on City of God"" for giving its baby gangstas a glamorous amount of power and for letting the amateurs who played them eat their roles up. But the two kids in Running Scared"" walk into lurid scene after lurid scene emotionally detached from it all as if the nastiness will roll off them because theyve refused to engage it. They seem catatonic instead.Running Scared"" might have been able to get away with the relentless sadism the boys witness were the movie as good as the John Woo and Quentin Tarantino films from which Kramer is cribbing. Instead its often just witless and foul. It might be actionable too. If I were Kramer Id watch my back for a lawsuit from Rockstar Games for what feels like an unauthorized and relocated adaptation of Grand Theft Auto Vice City.""Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Paul Walker stars as a low-level mobster who is supposed to dispose of hot guns but instead hides them in his house. New Line Cinema The movie is Running Scared and thats entertainment? A potential howler done in by a tendency to wear too much body tissue on its sleeve Paul Walkers first movie in a week opens with mass killings and then a more benign table-setter suburban folks sexcapades in the laundry room. Then the main story kabooms in A Russian meth dealer is shot by his physically abused stepson. A stray bullet flies next door disturbing the post-laundry family dinner of Mob flunky Walker whose gun was used in the shooting. Purloined from his basement by the young shooter (Walkers sons best friend) it has some history. One of its bullets was plucked from the corpse of a dirty cop and if an equally soiled surviving colleague (Chazz Palminteri) puts everything together most of the films supporting cast is going down. About the movieRunning Scared  1/2 (out of four)Director Wayne Kramer Stars Paul Walker Cameron Bright Vera Farmiga Chazz Palminteri Johnny Messner Distributor New Line Cinema Rating R for pervasive strong brutal violence and language sexuality and drug content Running time 2 hours 2 minutes Opens Friday nationwide This one has it all a psycho with a picture of John Wayne tattooed on his back torture by third-degree burns a set-piece in which hockey players blister pucks off someones face (and the Gretzkys thought they had a tough month). The one genuinely disturbing scene (because its well cast and isnt the same old Jersey-hood stuff) is also the ickiest and most gratuitously tangential to the story. The writer/director is The Coolers Wayne Kramer who apparently has striven to make a movie in which every scene is like its far superior predecessors knee-breaking sequence. Atop fidgety direction from the Domino school this also is the latest movie filmed in green and brown. The classic cinematographers called their work ""painting with light."" This is more like painting with rust. This Running Scared has nothing to do with the same-name Roy Orbison tune or 1986s Billy Crystal-Gregory Hines cop comedy -- and absolutely nothing in spirit to do with Walkers other current release Disneys dog opera Eight Below. What a business One week youre in Antarctica sleeping chastely with Jason Biggs and the next your co-stars are sleeping with the fishes.

"Running Scared | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; running-scared ) Running Scared (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Running Scared feels like Tony Scott on barbiturates. From tone to approach its like a Scott-helmed movie but the tendency to show off is limited the camera movements are less frantic and the editing occasionally allows shots to last for more than a second. The result is a picture that retains coherence to go along with its pile-driver intensity. With a complex plot that unspools with surprising clarity Running Scared displays a reckless intensity. In retrospect a lot of what the film offers falls apart but the filmmakers do their best to use adrenaline to keep us from thinking too much during the experience. When I first heard that Running Scared was a ""Paul Walker"" movie I winced. The kinds of films Walker is associated with are not normally representative of the fare I enjoy. But the mans work here is a revelation. This isnt the Paul Walker whose good looks and stiff performances have made him a king of PG-13. Here hes gritty grungy shows a full spectrum of emotion and displays more than a scintilla of ability. It took less than a minute for me to stop thinking of him as Paul Walker and accept him as Joey Gazelle low-level mobster. The film opens with a drug buy gone bad. A group of masked crooked cops led by the grizzled Detective Rydell (Chazz Palminteri) attempts to steal the money and the drugs and a gunfight explodes. Aside from Rydell the lone survivors are Joey and two of his associates. Joey is given the job of disposing of the gun that killed the cops. Instead of ditching it however he hides it in a compartment in his basement. His covert activity is observed by his son Nicky (Alex Neuberger) and the boy next door Oleg (Cameron Bright). Oleg pilfers the gun with the intent of putting an end to his step-fathers abuse. When he fires the weapon all hell breaks loose. Suddenly theres a way to connect the mobsters to the dead cops. Its up to Joey to find Oleg before the cops do - and before his mobster allies turn on him for not doing his job. Caught in the middle is Joeys wife Teresa (Vera Farmiga) whos frightened for and furious at her husband. Generally speaking Running Scared is a wild and entertaining ride even if the level of coincidence and contrivance sets off alarm bells. While this creates opportunities for twists and double-backs it becomes a bit too much. Some of what writer/director Wayne Kramer does is clever; some is unnecessary. It can be distracting when a viewer becomes aware that a filmmaker is manipulating the chessboard. Despite Running Scareds high energy level the attentive audience member will never become so completely distracted that he or she loses sight of this. The films structure forces the majority of the action to be presented in flashback. Im not fond of this ""hip"" narrative technique. It has become stale through overuse. One could argue that theres more reason for it to be used here than in many of the dozens of other movies and TV shows it has infected but there would be benefits to allowing the story to unfold chronologically. For non-linear storytelling to work there needs to be a compelling reason to use it. Im not sure the payoff in Running Scared qualifies. As much of a revelation as Paul Walkers acting is he isnt the strongest performer in the film. That distinction belongs to Vera Farmiga. Despite having an extensive resume I cant recall having previously noticed her although she has appeared in a few movies I have seen. She received universally rave reviews and multiple film festival acting citations for Down to the Bone a picture that never achieved distribution outside of New York and Los Angeles. Based on that it should be no surprise that her work here is arresting. The children - Cameron Bright and Alex Neuberger - are solid and the villains (Chazz Palminteri Karel Roden) ooze malice. As he did with his previous movie The Cooler Kramer pushes the envelope of the MPAAs R rating. In addition to the orgy of violence theres an abundance of profanity several full frontal nude shots and an oral sex scene thats less explicit than it seems to be. Considering the MPAAs prudish tendencies its surprising that Running Scared wasnt slapped with an NC-17. But Kramer got away with some stuff and the result gives his film more punch than a neutered version would have. If you like kinetic movies about crime criminals and all sorts of bad behavior Running Scared will catch and hold your attention.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 24 2006 Save for later Saved The hallucinatory crime thriller ""Running Scared"" written and directed by Wayne Kramer is pretty awful and not something I would normally devote much space to. But it is a prime example of a distressing movie trend and is likely to be popular so its worth discussing.Its not news that moviemakers when it comes to violence are forever trying to up the ante. Part of the reason for this is cultural Violent times compel violent imagery. But most of the reason is less highfalutin. Megaviolence sells tickets. Since the sizable audience for these films wants to see something they havent seen before the stakes only get higher and higher.""Running Scared"" is about a family man Paul Walkers Joey Gazelle who is also a low-level Mafia soldier. His attempt to recover an incriminating gun that was used in the shooting of a corrupt cop threatens not only his wife (Vera Farmiga) and son but also his sons 10-year-old best friend Oleg whose abusive Russian mobster stepfather is also in pursuit of the boy. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In the course of the movie we witness any number of gougings splatterings slicings and dicings often with Oleg as an unwilling and sometimes willing participant. In one particularly fragrant scene Joeys head is pressed flat onto a hockey rink while a puck is repeatedly smashed into his face. He survives undamaged. So much for showing the consequences of mayhem. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 If the usual schlockmeisters had made this film it would not occasion much more than the usual alarm. But the people involved in ""Running Scared"" are far from untalented.Kramers first feature ""The Cooler"" was an acclaimed indie film. Walker is a rising star whose role as a dog-loving survival guide in the current ""Eight Below"" is about as far as you can get from this one. (About the only thing he doesnt do here is kill a canine.) Farmiga recently won the Los Angeles Critics Association award for best actress for her role as a junkie trying to go straight in the little-seen ""Down to the Bone.""When promising independent filmmakers decide to jump on the bandwagon and pump up the gore the results are sure to be touted as visceral and unflinching. Dont be fooled. Kramer has even commented that the movie should be viewed as a modern-day Grimms fairy tale. Its grim all right. Grade D Rated R for pervasive strong brutal violence and language sexuality and drug content.Sex/Nudity 9 instances including inudendo. Violence 31 instances. Profanity 354 instances mostly harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 12 scenes.

Running Scared Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/running-scared-2006,200,runningscared18,runningscared,rogerebert
"Grisly Running Scared Mostly a Copycat Crime washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Grisly Running Scared Mostly a Copycat Crime Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 24 2006 ""Im sorry"" says Oleg to his Russian stepfather Anzor who is bandaged and still shaken from the bullets Oleg had pumped into him with his silver snub-nose. ""Thats okay"" says Anzor a tough former gangster who has decided to forgive and forget. ""Sorry I missed "" says Oleg who by the way is 10. This is just one of many bizarre disquieting moments from Wayne Kramers feverishly violent ""Running Scared"" which throws together goombahs catatonic kids good cops dirty cops narcs informers mobsters former mobsters rival mobsters to the mobsters bad fathers good fathers angry sons beloved sons and one gun -- that silver snub-nose which is the source of everyones trouble. At the center of the story is Joey (Paul Walker in five-day-stubble-slumming mode) whos Mr. Cleanup for the mob. That means he disposes of their dirty guns the ones used for murder that would incriminate them. Evidently a packrat he likes to keep them stashed in his basement. This is a very bad move. His son Nicky (Alex Neuberger) and his neighbor-pal Oleg (Cameron Bright) accidentally uncover Joeys weapons cache one day and the shootings begin. It starts with Oleg blam-blamming his stepfather. Why? Because Anzor (Karel Roden) is a meth-addicted paranoid who beats and terrifies Oleg for such horrible crimes as insulting his favorite movie star John Wayne. After shooting Anzor Oleg runs off with the gun and disappears into the convoluted subplots of New Jersey. Joey who realizes his life depends on retrieving that snub-nose before it lands in the wrong hands goes after Oleg. But hes playing catch-up with a kid with a laughable knack for getting into trouble. In his first encounter for instance Oleg interrupts a white-haired pimp about to slit the throat of one of his hookers. Naturally the Russian kid is compelled to wave his gun around. After that jeepers creepers he finds himself the captive of a husband-and-wife killing duo whose special interest is pedophilia. Sometimes it just aint your day. Or your movie. ""Running Scared"" never met an over-the-top character convoluted subplot or gruesome exit wound it didnt love. Its as if writer-director Kramer who also made 2003s ""The Cooler"" watched ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" repeatedly for 10 days straight then sat at the word processor and kept typing until he collapsed. Not surprisingly everything feels begged borrowed and stolen from other better movies from Quentin Tarantinos exclamation-point violence to the slo-mo bullet trajectory shots from ""The Matrix."" As a director Kramer seems no less frantic or determined to draw attention to himself. Each scene is ratcheted up to the screaming point whether with over-stylized lighting grainy images or scenery-chewing performances. And in one ""subtler"" sequence he starts with an extreme close-up of a soda can as it is popped open. The camera pulls back to show Detective Rydell (Chazz Palminteri) the one opening the soda in the interrogation room with Oleg -- whom he wants to grill for the guns whereabouts. This is the smart-aleck imagery of graphic novels and comic books which would be fine for a film like ""Sin City."" But ""Running Scared"" is aiming for a grittier realism at odds with those gymnastic camera angles. Watching this movie youre always aware of the man behind the curtain -- and never for the right reasons. By the time you get to the movies proudest set piece a particularly gruesome finale on an ice hockey rink (where you will learn exactly what a well-hit puck does to the human face) youd be wise to have shut down all tender senses and just like 10-year-old Oleg stare blankly and self-protectively into the darkness. Running Scared (113 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for excessive violence profanity sexual content and nudity.

This is but one of many thorny questions raised by Running Scared a giddily awful awfully giddy action noir that follows a low-level mafioso (Walker) on his hunt for a hot gun lifted from his family basement by a troubled neighbor-child who in turn uses it against his abusive step-father who just happens to be the meth-making Russian-mobster-next-door not to mention a fanatical John Wayne aficionado. Actually to say this movie ""follows"" anything is severely misleading Running is a fevered smashup as if Hollywood dug up Sam Peckinpahs corpse and forced it to adapt Grand Theft Auto Vice City for the screen. But this isnt a Hollywood movie at all. Writer-director Wayne Kramer (The Cooler) is the latest ""outsider"" to prove theres no blockbuster cliche independent filmmakers dont covet. Marinara accents? Check. Hooker con corazon de oro? Si. But give it this Running Scared is pugnaciously ugly unvarnished hackwork and it commits to its nightmarish puerility with a vengeance. The picture pulsates with a genuine un-focus-grouped bloodlust. A child with a gun is its central image -- and its assumed that this will not horrify but empower. Pederasts appear suddenly and improbably caper demonically and are banished ballistically. Its as if someone smelted his personal ""issues"" into bullets spun them into a cylinder and fired them directly into your brain.
