In this adaptation of TD Jakess novel the sides are unevenly armed. Clarice (Taraji P Henson) may have financial success as a real-estate agent but she loses sympathy points by always complaining about how much time husband Dave (Morris Chestnut) spends coaching baseball to deprived kids. Things weigh even more heavily against womankind when Clarices mother (Jenifer Lewis) moves in to help Clarice recover from a broken leg and begins a campaign of Dave-demeaning. No wonder Dave is tempted by Clarices hot physical therapist Julie (Maeve Quinlan); as we learn he spends so much time with her only because her son needs a father. But even Saint Dave is ready to throw in the towel on his marriage.In keeping with Jakess philosophy (hes a leader of a Dallas megachurch) the moral of the film delivered gently but firmly is that Dave and Clarice need to invite God into their marriage. Thats a reasonable message but it might feel more resonant if the script were a little fairer to both sexes.

Most often time is spent on the traditional faults of men sometimes being the only cause and sometimes as in this case having a deeper root. Most often the deeper root is not realized or acknowledged. The heart of a man is very different in some ways from a woman. Also in this moder day society the roles of men have dramaticaly changed and this movie is addressing those changes. In any marriage things go unfairly life is not all about being fair. Fairness to the sexes should be seen in movies as a whole not just this one film. No one film can be completely fair and at the same time be real. Also this sheds light on some of the things that women may do that hurt their marriages and especialy as more and more women are career driven it addresses the changing society we face. I think it is very possible that as we pursue certain things in life we unknowingly repell other things as wel unless we find a balance. We also need to be able to derive lessons from both sides not just from the portrayl. A woman could cheat on her man just the same way that the man in this movie was about to. And a man can be so caught up in stuff and how he can be supported and that hes pulling the weight that he neglects whats most important to keeping his life happy - working on his relationship with his wife. (this movie especially points to a situation many african american women face in one many of them who have upper level jobs or higher level education have a harder time finding a mate and when these women do find a mate situations such as seen in this movie can occur. Seeing how to deal and how not to deal is very important. Bitterness passed down from generations like with this ladies mother also need to be addressed as many black children or youngadult african americans grow up without a strong positive father figure leaving the mother with her own issues that can be passed down and the cycle continues. This issue affects them in many ways this movie picked one point of view. Another movie will do it from another point of view. I think there was much to learn from this movie as well as much to relate to. The writing although not entirely sophisticated was still thought provoking and in some places still profound enough to give this movie a good rating. The cinematography and character development were not the makings of a classic movie feature but this film clearly was more so intended to convey much needed messages to the viewers about one of the most important aspects of our lives our relationships.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 18 2010PeterFeaturedThe movie has a goal to get the poinit across and it does.

One winces for Lisa Kudrow poured into a tight miniskirt as an aspiring rock star and wicked foster parent to two cute orphaned siblings (Emma Roberts and Jake T. Austin) and no less for Don Cheadle as the kindly Child Protection officer who toils to find them a loving family. Collecting strays as they go the children install themselves and a herd of good-looking dogs in a formerly grand downtown hotel and set up a utopian alternative to the pound and the orphanage. Novice director Thor Freudenthal has worked as a storyboard artist and it shows in the movies lone imaginative diversion -- the gizmos set up by a lonely child to entertain the hounds so they wont bark up the authorities. In the department of small mercies the dogs dont talk but the human dialogue is as stale as the characters bathing in love-the-family-youre-with pathos. (Citywide) (Ella Taylor) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D was not screened in advance of our publication deadline but a review will appear here next week. (Citywide)NOT EASILY BROKEN Would that the sparring spouses of Revolutionary Road had only thought to turn to the Lord for help; it would have solved all their pesky problems. Such is the lesson to be taken from Not Easily Broken the second feature film (after 2004s Woman Thou Art Loosed) adapted from the novels of Dallas televangelist T.D. Jakes. Directed by actor Bill Duke (whose erratic behind-the-camera career has ranged from the searing neonoir Deep Cover to the altacocker crowd-pleaser The Cemetery Club) Not Easily Broken begins in 1995 with the wedding of pro-baseball player Dave (Morris Chestnut) and upwardly mobile real-estate agent Clarice (Benjamin Buttons Taraji P. Henson) then catches up to the present where a knee injury has sidelined Dave into a contracting career and Clarices taste for luxury finds the couple living well beyond their means. Its not long before the strands of their union begin to fray abetted by a car accident that leaves Clarice with a mangled leg to complement Daves metaphorical knee. Tragedy lurks around every bend here along with the requisite quotient of meddling mothers-in-law derelict baby-daddies and Nordic-looking white temptresses -- all of it played to the rafters for an unsteady mixture of Sirkian melodrama and ""You go girl""/""Oh no he didnt"" empowerment fable. These resourceful actors -- to say nothing of the audience -- deserve better. ""Dont go all Waiting to Exhale on me"" advises one of Clarices soul sisters late in the film. If only. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas)NOTORIOUS In this thoroughly inoffensive biopic about Notorious B.I.G. Christopher ""Biggie"" Wallace is played by Jamal Woolard known as rapper Gravy who does a respectably credible impersonation. It helps that hes a first-time actor; Woolard offers more than just another famous face playing Hollywood Halloween dress-up unlike Derek Luke as Sean ""Puff Daddy"" Combs and Anthony Mackie as Tupac Shakur. Hes imposing but also gentle a bastard but also an angel and he renders a young Chris Wallaces dreams almost tangible. But director George Tillman Jr. (Men of Honor) who makes square and reliable biopics every decade or so doesnt have time to dwell on the nobody Chris whos too small-fry for the bigtime Biggie story for which the audience has paid its hard-earned. He fast-forwards instead to the glossy glamorous life -- the fuck-you photo-ops with Tupac; the change-the-world meetings with Puff Daddy; the steamy trysts with Lil Kim (Naturi Naughton) and Faith Evans (Antonique Smith); and the nasty run-ins with Suge Knight (Sean Ringgold). The movie turns into a parade of bold-faced names -- a hip-hop stunt-cast episode of Entourage but with a decidedly tragic ending. Notorious doesnt wash away Biggies sins but it absolves him too easily; as every deeds done its explained away by the ghost of Biggie spouting hindsight wisdom. Such is the restraint to be expected from the authorized biography -- Notorious after all was produced by Biggies mom and executive-produced by Combs who do just enough to burnish the legend without tarnishing it.

Sep. 13 600pm GO   OWL AND THE SPARROW The humanistic ensemble drama has gotten such a bad name in recent years thanks to ponderous high-profile entries like Crash and Babel that a barebones plot description of Owl and the Sparrow might convince you that youve seen this movie before -- and more importantly that you dont want to see it again. Still dont let that discourage you from seeking out writer-director-cinematographer Stephane Gaugers lovely debut which tracks a week in the separate lives of three young Vietnamese a flight attendant on holiday (Cat Ly) a zoo employee (Le The Lu) and a 10-year-old runaway (Pham Thi Han). As expected the characters cross paths amid the hustle and bustle of Saigons eight million residents but Gauger forgoes the usual convoluted narrative coincidences in order to craft a refreshingly simple look at loneliness and tentative connection. Those hoping for grander political commentary about Saigons urban poverty will be disappointed; Gauger is less concerned with sociology than in following his guarded but intensely empathetic characters through this slight resonant story. At its core Owl and the Sparrow is yet one more film that preaches the importance of opening your heart and reaching out to those around you but that treacly sentiment is nicely undercut by the unvarnished naturalness of the actors -- particularly young Han who doesnt have a cutesy bone in her body. (Sunset 5) (Tim Grierson)PAUL BLART MALL COP Somewhere beneath its mediocre comedic trappings theres a decent action movie trying to fight its way free from Paul Blart Mall Cop which stars Kevin James as an overweight regular joe who can use only the items in the mall where he works to fight obnoxious extreme sports athletes with guns. Done as an all-out battle to the death this could have been an entertaining mix of Die Hard and The A-Team; the movie briefly sputters to life when the passive policeman-in-training actually has to fight and becomes a badass for a second or two. Alas it takes forever for the plot proper to kick in -- meanwhile there are endless fat jokes which even Chris Farley would have rejected and numerous plugs for the Segway and Perfectmatch.com. That this is a Happy Madison production suggests that James starring role here is a reward for being in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry; that previous Adam Sandler rewards to his friends have included Grandmas Boy and Strange Wilderness ought to be sufficient warning of what to expect.

Henson as ""Clarice Clark"" in ""Not Easily Broken."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Not Easily Broken"" is a well-crafted message picture disguised as soap opera. Its the latest production from Bishop T.D. Jakes a popular TV clergyman and author who is expanding his reach through film. If that sets off alarm bells relax. Religion plays an important role in the lives of the films upper-middle-class black characters but the tone isnt preachy. The film opens with the wedding of Dave (Morris Chestnut) and Clarice (Taraji P. Henson) whose minister symbolically unites them by draping a three-stranded cord around their necks. Two fibers represent the couple and the third is God he explains and if they remain intertwined the relationship will thrive. The homily is filed away as they pursue upward mobility. Daves dreams of a baseball career are shattered by injury. Instead he starts a modest practice as a building contractor while Clarice outpaces his earnings as a real estate saleswoman. Time-pressured and focused on getting ahead she begins to ignore him. Instead of talking she verbally overwhelms him with advice instructions and complaints while he withdraws. Dave wants children and begins spending every free hour with his basketball buddies or coaching his Little League team. As their relationship frays they grope for outside sources of support. Dave seeks solace with his pals who have comic women problems of their own and his young ballplayers especially one neglected by his ex-con father. Clarice turns to her job her girlfriends and her overbearing bitter mother (steely Jenifer Lewis) who scapegoats Dave for every flaw in their marriage. The couple forget their ministers counsel to make God the third strand in their cord. The characters arent the flat figures of a morality tale but rather well-meaning limited people struggling as we all must do. When a traffic accident puts Clarice in a wheelchair and an attractive blonde physical therapist enters the couples lives theyre ill-prepared to handle the temptation and jealousy her presence generates. Jakes message is nuanced; piety doesnt offer prefabricated answers. He approves of the couples efforts to get ahead but cautions against letting an acquisitive lifestyle distract them from basic values. In a funny pointed scene Clarice exaggerates Daves professional capabilities to a tableful of real estate investors while he frets that his credit card will be declined. NOT EASILY BROKEN  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual references and thematic elements. The film is dramatically persuasive and well-paced. Bill Dukes workmanlike direction never gets in the way of the message but it never becomes contrived. George Orwell observed ""All art is propaganda. But not all propaganda is art."" ""Not Easily Broken"" gets the equation right. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

I was in distress too wilting beneath the crushing obviousness of this story of an LA contractor (Morris Chestnut) having communication problems with his wife (Taraji P. Henson of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") that he discusses at length with two guy friends. All of them sound like theyve spent the last 10 years watching relationship advice on daytime television. At the outset a minister tells Dave the contractor and his real-estate agent wife Clarice that a marriage is like a rope with three strands husband wife and God. When the three are woven together the rope is not easily broken. The fourth strand though corrodes the other three. Clarice has a live-in mom who has appointed herself the marriages full-time heckler and the movie would be over in five minutes if Dave threw her out of the house. Instead theres an accident that introduces a curvy blond physical therapist (Maeve Quinlan) into the house. One of Daves workout buddies wants to get next to her but Dave finds himself sharing an emotional connection with her as his wife becomes increasingly tiresome. Not as tiresome as the movie. At one point I looked at my watch stunned that only an hour had gone by. I was stunned that it was still January. Theres a little guy who is being controlled by his wife a nerdy white kid (""Whats crackin yall?"") and lots of low-cal soul searching such as ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" Someone says ""Do not make me go Oprah on you. Because I will"" as if the entire movie isnt up to its chin in Oprah-ism. Fans of Tyler Perry may go for ""Not Easily Broken"" which saunters along unassumingly with broad comedy soapy confrontations some churchy stuff and a surplus of niceness. How nice? The neighborhood ex-con (Wood Harris - Avon Barksdale from ""The Wire"") challenges Dave to a really rough game of basketball. But why go for imitation Tyler Perry when the master is so industrious? Perrys next one should be along in about 10 minutes. NOT EASILY BROKEN Or easily endured. Running time 99 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexual references adult themes.

Photo Ron Phillips Screen Gems Movie review Cliches nag Not Easily Broken 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Not Easily Broken Drama. Starring Morris Chestnut Taraji Henson and Kevin Hart. Directed by Bill Duke. (Rated PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). The opening wedding scene in the new Bill Duke film ""Not Easily Broken"" is so overwrought and cliched its akin to sitting down with a promising novel cracking open the cover and reading on the first page ""It was a dark and stormy night ..."" But 10 minutes into the movie adapted from the popular T.D. Jakes novel the story begins to unwind into an intriguing study of a troubled marriage in contemporary Los Angeles race and the promise of reconciliation. Dave (Morris Chestnut still instantly recognizable from ""Boyz n the Hood"") is emasculated by the success of his wife Clarice a real estate manager. Clarices ambition and need to keep up appearances in their upscale neighborhood drives a wedge between her and Dave a general contractor whos more connected to his weekly basketball buddies than to his wife. What ""Not Easily Broken"" gets right is the way middle- and upper-class whites and African Americans cross paths in urban settings today; theres little self-consciousness left in the Obama generation yet theres still awareness - yeah were different. Big deal. So when Dave begins to stray from Clarice and his attention happens to be set on a white woman whos struggling with her own losses their connection is human first. Its a refreshing take because when blacks and whites cross paths in Los Angeles on a Hollywood movie screen its usually a culture clash for laughs (Steve Martin Queen Latifah in ""Bringing Down the House"") or a saccharine-fest meant to assuage white guilt (""Crash""). Yet whatever goodwill ""Not Easily Broken"" earns with its subtle portrayal of race relations it squanders on a simplistic attitude toward fixing troubled marriages. In this film God is a character like Santa Claus He delivers gifts to those who believe in him and withholds from those who do not. When Dave and Clarice meet with their pastor theres a Christian ethic at work here that says Just stick it out brother. The marriage will get better in time. Unfortunately for those who do not subscribe to the notion that Gods dust smooths a marriages rough patches but rather hard work by people do the message rings hollow. Its a shame because ""Not Easily Broken"" is laced with strong performances unexpected plotlines and some chillingly dark laughs. Like some marriages it has its flaws but perhaps its the good stuff thats worth focusing on.

Henson) and a terror of a mother-in-law (Jenifer Lewis). ABOUT THE MOVIE Not Easily Broken    (out of four) Stars Morris Chestnut Taraji P. Henson Kevin Hart Eddie CibrianDirector Bill DukeDistributor Sony Pictures EntertainmentRating PG-13 for sexual references and thematic elementsRunning time 1 hour 39 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Marriage is not for the faint of heart and its bonds should not be easily torn asunder. The message of responsibility and commitment rings loud and clear in the entertaining if occasionally melodramatic Not Easily Broken. This is a likable and pleasant film based on a book by the Rev. T.D. Jakes with a particularly strong performance by Morris Chestnut as a man having marital problems after his career as a professional ballplayer has ended. Chestnut plays the easygoing Dave married to a materialistic and ambitious real-estate agent named Clarice (Benjamin Buttons Taraji P. Henson). Daves desires are fairly straightforward He wants a family and hes intent on helping at-risk kids through sports. He also would like to avoid interference from his overbearing and embittered mother-in-law (Jenifer Lewis). But Clarice is a bit of a mamas girl and wants the good life. Shes not ready for children and resents the time Dave spends coaching Little League. She wants him to drive in style in a Cadillac Escalade; hes happy with his old truck. She tries to amp up his construction business but hes a humble fellow with modest ambitions. The cards are stacked pretty heavily against the nagging Clarice and her terror of a mother. Dave is the emotional center of this unabashedly sentimental movie. A voice-over narration speaks of a time when men were clear-cut heroes to women. But it says women have now become their own heroes. Men need to regain their heroic status. What about mutual heroism? The film has its heart in the right place. The message is hard to fault Men would do well to focus on their family and rely on their inherent sense of decency and faith. It makes no bones about having a religious undercurrent but it also doesnt shy away from riotous humor. Nor does it avoid melodrama which is where it most falters. A tragedy occurs in the last third of the film that suddenly turns this affable dramedy off course into something more manipulative and tear-jerking. The films cinematography also looks a bit amateurish. But it is saved by the generally engaging performances of the principals. Kevin Hart is very funny as Tree Daves ultra-emotional buddy and Chestnuts slow burn stares are a treat to watch. Not Easily Broken is well-acted and involving though this relationship drama may put some people off with its overt sentimentality and moralizing.

Comments Not Easily Broken Taraji P. Henson (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) gets her first leading role as a successful Los Angeles realtor who overshadows her blue-collar husband (Morris Chestnut) and continually postpones having children. Based on the novel by T.D. Jakes this is a queasy mix of comedy melodrama and self-help spirituality; its meant to be uplifting but its profamily message is undercut by its virulently misogynistic treatment of the realtor and her mother (Jenifer Lewis) both too shrewish and controlling to be believed. Visually the movie is flat except for some edgy gymnasium scenes shot in desaturated color that could double as Nike commercials. Bill Duke (Hoodlum A Rage in Harlem) directed. PG-13 99 min.

Henson play an LA couple whose marriage is tested. By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / January 9 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Not Easily Broken"" is a tub of soapy cliches. But it does grant Morris Chestnut a kind of ""Eureka"" moment. After years spent strolling his way through battle-of-the-sexes comedies (perhaps you caught him and Vivica A. Fox wipe the floor with each other in ""Two Can Play That Game"") and horror-thriller atrocities (he was ""and Morris Chestnut"" in the credits for ""Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid"" and ""The Cave"") hes softened the texture on the cocky buppies and hard-bodies he usually plays. This time hes just Dave Johnson a down-on-his-luck building contractor in Los Angeles put through a domestic ringer after his flamboyantly successful real-estate agent wife Clarice (Taraji P. Henson) has a car accident.Dave coaches a youth baseball team with two buddies (Eddie Cibrian and Kevin Hart). Hes trying to start his own business although not fast enough for Clarice who resents anything that takes Daves attention off her. Clarice of course is one of those women who berates her adoring man for failing to see how hard shes working. I suppose that car accident which leaves her in need of physical therapy is meant as a kind of celestial comeuppance. The Lord does work in mysterious ways - or at least pastor T.D. Jakes does.""Not Easily Broken"" is based on one of the best-selling preachers novels and all its lessons have been hammered into a screenplay full of coincidences only a daytime television devotee could love. When Dave meets a physical therapist (Maeve Quinlan) how long until he asks her to work on his wife? And how much longer until the wife starts to suspect that the cute single (and white) therapist wants her man? How much longer until the husbands slutty best friend (Cibrian) gets a little miffed that the therapist prefers his married buddy to him? As a former devotee of daytime television I do believe I heard the piano chime from ""The Young and the Restless"" at least once.For most of ""Not Easily Broken"" I wondered why the movie wasnt worse. Then I remembered it was directed by the veteran Bill Duke who applies ample TLC. A lot of what he has to work with is excessive (one sequence drums up ludicrous horror-thriller suspense over whether a credit card will be approved; another plot strain has Wood Harris as a bitter thug whose son Dave is trying to save). But as an actor himself Duke doesnt mind indulging his cast. Henson manages to bring a degree of decency to what is basically an emasculating Catherine Keener part. Sometimes Duke overindulges. Jenifer Lewis plays Clarices relentlessly overbearing mother and Daves new housemate and I never thought Id wish for less of her since shes always underused. But a little of her thunder goes a long way here.While everybody else is cutting up including Niecy Nash as one of Clarices co-workers Chestnut is on his best-ever behavior. And as usual he meets his fan-mandated contractual obligations. (Not easily broken? Perhaps not. Frequently shirtless? Of course) But he doesnt coast on that superhuman smile of his or the virility it advertises. Hes likably average for once hurting confused and no more heroic than he needs to be. What Chestnut does here isnt a feat of acting so much as a leap of emotional vulnerability. He rolls with the many demoralizing punches in ""Not Easily Broken"" like a gentleman.At some point Dave tells Clarice ""come here"" and there isnt an Ramp;B singer alive who could put as much easy sex into the command. If Clarice doesnt appreciate this man I know several hundred thousand women who would.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

The T.D. Jakes faith-based media empire expands even further into mainstream entertainment with ""Not Easily Broken"" a contempo melodrama about a marriage under stress that religious overtones and sheer artistic skill aside isnt too far from some similar-themed films of the 50s by Douglas Sirk and Richard Quine. Director Bill Duke with screenwriter Brian Bird adapting Jakes novel oversees a routine and formulaic project that could have reached considerably greater emotional and psychological depths. The Good Word of mouth among members of Jakes flock will deliver fine opening weekend numbers for this early January release. With husband Dave (Morris Chestnut) narrating from the start pic wastes no time announcing itself as a domestic drama that will be viewed from the male perspective. Not unlike Jakes previous film and play ""Woman Thou Art Loosed"" the narrative somewhat celebrates women working outside the home while suggesting that modern marriages may be in trouble because men feel marginalized by the threat of womens lib -- a familiar if retro theme among Jakes heroes. A decade since their 1995 marriage Dave and Clarice (Taraji P. Henson ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") have seen their fortunes flip An injury has ended his dream of becoming a Major League Baseball player while her real estate career has taken off. Early scenes establish Dave as a nice humble guy whos accepted his lot in life driving around a beat-up truck for his remodeling business and coaching little league while Clarice is full of herself as her offices top salesperson. Audience sympathies are crudely stacked against Clarice who loudly and repeatedly complains that Dave is spending too much time coaching ""little gangbangers-in-training"" while allowing her annoying mother Mary (Jenifer Lewis) to intrude on their domestic life and echo Clarices huffy arguments. Dave is so adept at coaching and giving young boys support that all he lacks is a halo and Clarices inexplicable reluctance to have a baby with a man whos obviously ideal daddy material borders on the pathological. Things get worse after a nearly fatal car crash leaves Clarice facing a long period of rehab at home for a broken leg. Julie (Maeve Quinlan) a blonde single mom whos already traded glances with Daves buddy Brock (Eddie Cibrian) turns out to be the physical therapist who earns Clarices trust and helps her get back in shape. ""Not Easily Broken"" embraces its weepie tendencies in a very 50s kind of way but seriously misplays its hand at the critical juncture when Dave would be nursing Clarice back to health. Further tragedy and Daves temptation to strike up an affair with Julie sends an already flawed third act into the dramaturgical ER. The always bad idea of slotting characters as types for the purpose of driving home messages about how to live ones life ensures a fairly lifeless melodrama in which the comic moments provided by spunky comic Kevin Hart who steals several scenes as one of Daves buddies are like mannah from heaven. The pigeonholed characters constrict Chestnut and the usually good Henson from portraying fully developed adults; the same dilemma hits most of the supporting cast including Quinlan and Wood Harris as a troubled ex-ballplayer with worse issues than Dave. The easygoing Cibrian joins Hart in offering welcome distraction and the ideally cast Albert Hall brings his reliable gravitas to bear as the marrieds caring concerned bishop (effectively playing Jakes himself). Speaking of Jakes he appears to good effect in a credited cameo -- not playing himself -- during a mildly amusing restaurant scene. Tech credits are nothing more than standard-issue.

"Not Easily Broken stars Morris Chestnut Taraji P. Henson - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Not Easily Broken stars Morris Chestnut Taraji P. Henson Michael PhillipsTribune critic Bishop T.D. Jakes head of a megachurch in Dallas has a wife five kids 30000 flock members and a long line of books to his name among them ""Mama Made the Difference Life Lessons My Mother Taught Me."" He wrote the novel ""Not Easily Broken"" with both eyes on the silver screen. It is a faith-based love story secondarily about Gods role in the care and feeding of an L.A. couples turbulent marriage.Primarily the film directed by actor-friendly Bill Duke is about the power of good casting. Thanks to Morris Chestnut whose warm easy screen presence was an asset way back in ""Boyz N the Hood"" and to Taraji P. Henson adoptive mother of the title character in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" this by-the-book scenario ends up being a pretty entertaining read. Screenwriter Brian Bird refers to ""Not Easily Broken"" as ""sort of a male version of the film Waiting to Exhale. "" Our narrator Dave marries Clarice when theyre young and full of dreams. Daves plans are dashed in the introductory montage An onfield college injury derails his future in pro baseball. Years later Daves a struggling contractor while real estate agent Clarice rakes in the dough--enough nearly to support a heavy mortgage keep Clarice in Escalade territory or higher and generally maintain the consuming trappings of success.Several big things and a lot of little things pile up in ""Not Easily Broken."" These include a near-fatal car accident; Daves friendship teetering on the edge of trouble with his wifes physical therapist (Maeve Quinlan); and the gruesome play-by-play of Dave and Clarices marriage provided by Clarices mother (Jenifer Lewis) who moves in after the accident. Jakes and Bird side with the central male characters all the way. Unfortunately they turn Clarice and her mother into cardboard shrews. Remarkably the movie like the couple at its center isnt easily broken. By the end I was rooting for Dave to get right with Clarice even though the physical therapist seemed a lot calmer. Its more a matter of rooting for performers who know how to flesh out two-dimensional characters. Under Dukes direction which is visually pedestrian but well-attuned to his actors needs Chestnut keeps Dave on an effective low simmer while Hensons higher-key histrionics give way to honest revelations in the nick of time. Even when the plot heads toward heavy melodrama Duke keeps it semi-quasi-real. And for comic relief theres Kevin Hart (as one of Daves pals) scoring laughs simply by pretending to hide the fact that hes constantly on the verge of a crying jag. The film is likable. Its messages many of them Lord-oriented are all equally heartfelt.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual references and thematic elements).Running time 139.Opening Jan. 9.Starring Morris Chestnut (Dave); Taraji P.

"Movie review Not Easily Broken -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Not Easily Broken -- 2 out of 5 stars Morris Chestnut Sony Morris Chestnut Morris Chestnut (Sony) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Not Easily Broken is a marriage-in-crisis melodrama baked from the Tyler Perry recipe.Take a good-looking mostly African-American cast put them in an affluent setting paint the characters in broad ""symbolic"" strokes place the marriage in jeopardy add a little ""Take it to the Lord in prayer"" sermonizing and youve got a movie. Brian Birds script taken from T.D. Jakes novel has something to say about marriage manhood and even race. But did somebody actually pay Bird for typing the phrase ""On up in here"" in every page of the script or ""I got this"" or the hoariest African-American screen cliche of all the best friend who starts every sentence with ""Giiiiiiiiiirl""? The groaning triviality of the dialogue works against the cast and director Bill Duke as does the sermonizing voice-over narration by the lead Morris Chestnut.Chestnut plays Dave a onetime aspiring ballplayer who blew out his knee and now runs a small home-improvement business. His wife Clarice (Taraji P. Henson of Talk to Me and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) is the main bread-winner a high-end real-estate broker who has them living beyond their means. Dave narrates his problems and his philosophy of life onto the soundtrack. ""The world took away a mans reasons for being a man"" he gripes. ""Church is like a hospital. Its where sick people go to get well.""Clarice doles out petty humiliations to Dave in front of her clients and then turns bitter after a crippling car accident. Jenifer Lewis plays the shrewish mother-in-law who moves in with them doubling the nagging. Meanwhile Dave hangs with his boys -- both his pals (Kevin Hart plays the funny one) and young underprivileged baseball players he coaches. He takes an interest in one kids mom (Mauve Quinlan ). Niecy Nash is here to blurt out ""Giiiiiirlll"" and ""Dont make me go all Oprah on you"" or ""Dont go all Waiting to Exhale on me.""And the regal Albert Hall (Apocalypse Now) is the bishop who keeps reminding the struggling couple of their marriage vows the ""cord with three strands"" religious metaphor that will make it all better.Its not a terrible movie just a pandering one a film that youre sure youve seen before. Many times. Maybe we all should take some comfort from the fact that Hollywood studios are no longer copying generic rapper thrillers set ""in the hood."" But wheres the ambition in warming over a Madea sermon without Madea?
