Entertainment Yes These Things Actually Happen In ""Gods Of Egypt"" Alex Proyass fantasy of ancient Egypt is 2016s first big bomb. Sometimes its a glorious trainwreck -- and sometimes its a genuinely infuriating one. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic 1. 1. Gerard Butler just goes with the Scottish accent. View this image > Lionsgate Most of Gods of Egypts cast members decided that mortals and deities in a fantasyland version of ancient Egypt would speak with the English-ish accent that period pictures use to signal theyre set in the past. The notable exceptions are Chadwick Boseman whose god of wisdom Thoth opts for an excruciatingly unidentifiable but still vaguely theatrical cadence and Gerard Butler who decides his own Scottish brogue will do just fine for his god of the desert Set regardless of what the rest of the cast is up to. Theres something magnificent about the scene in which Set wades through the worshipful crowd at the coronation of a new god-king opens his mouth and lets out an apology for being late that makes it sound like Butler just wandered into the scene by accident. Its so ""fuck it"" he might as well be wearing jeans. He clearly felt that megalomaniacal living gods with daddy issues who can transform into dog-headed metallic forms can talk however they want. And who would argue the point? ID 8087916 2. 2. The actors playing the gods have all been sized up by 80%. View this image > Lionsgate Gods of Egypt reportedly cost 140 million but can look startlingly cheap. The CGI is omnipresent and rickety and some of the sets have the stageyness of a 50s biblical epic. But every once in a while theres an effect that evokes the more charming hokeyness of the 1981 Clash of the Titans -- and that effect is that all of the gods are several feet taller than all of the mortals. Its consistently silly looking like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Horus (god of the sky) and Elodie Yung as Hathor (goddess of love) were just sized up in Photoshop. But its also more memorable than the blur of impossible computer-generated cityscapes. ID 8088297 3. 3. The Earth is flat. View this image > Lionsgate (Call B.o.B) Director Alex Proyas isnt some movie noob -- the man directed the 1994 goth kid classic The Crow the solid Will Smith effort I Robot and the sci-fi noir mindfuck Dark City a film that came out a year before The Matrix in 1998 and comes close to beating the Wachowskis movie at its own game. And while Gods of Egypt is a trainwreck the feverish inventiveness of the imagery in Dark City occasionally glimmers through like in the scenes in which we see that the world in which the movie takes place is flat an archaic idea of the layout of the universe brought to evocative life. ID 8088370 4. 4. Geoffrey Rush lives on a space boat and fights a chaos worm. View this image > Liongate So yes sometimes Gods of Egypt has fascinatingly go-for-broke visuals. Other times 1997 Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush in liver spots white robes and a French braid as sun god Ra glowers on his boat in space between breaks fighting chaos as represented by a toothy cloud worm. ID 8092108 5. 5. Theres an ancient Egyptian skyscraper. View this image > Lionsgate Set has an obelisk erected that is more than 2000 cubits tall according to his architect (Rufus Sewell) -- and all without the use of construction cranes. That height would put it above 432 Park Avenue the obnoxiously expensive Manhattan residential skyscraper it somehow recalls. ID 8092145 6. 6. It features people of color but almost none of them get to speak. View this image > Lionsgate Gods of Egypt is a fantasy. Obviously. It takes place on an Earth thats a flat disk it includes visits to the land of the dead and it features nine-foot-tall gods with gold blood who do a lot of bickering and who are majority white like bland mortal pair Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and Zaya (Courtney Eaton). Proyas after apologizing for his whitewashing has defended his choices in part by saying his film isnt at all meant to be historically accurate. But this is a film that borrows the aspects of a culture it deems exciting while leaving behind the actual humans from whom that culture sprung. It pulls from mythology and imagery of the time then inserts magic literal gods among men like blue-eyed blonde-haired Dane Coster-Waldau with the implication being that these tweaks were all to make the story more interesting. If in fantasy anything is possible then having almost all of your main characters be white is an active choice something positioned as an improvement. If in fantasy anything is possible that just underscores that the movie starts with a sea of people of color cheering for the white gods above them by design. The extras in the crowd scenes and those playing servants in the background are more diverse than the main cast -- people of color are used as wordless set dressing. But freed from the bounds of history and those who participated it Gods of Egypt leaps right for the opportunity to cast Australian beefcake. Its not exactly a tribute to the power of imagination.

Iam not sure. 129 Shares Share 93 Tweet 20 Share 10 Share Email Print Share Photo Lionsgate ""Im the goddess of too much"" says the beautiful Hathor (Elodie Yung) partway throughA Gods of Egypt. Whos the god or goddess of too little? Because one could imagine that Alex Proyass film might be the end result of an epic battle between those two deities. Its both thin and overstuffed filled with intricate at times dazzling setpieces peopled by characters we dont care about and an irreverent sense of fun that nevertheless leaves us cold. It tries so hard ... and ultimately achieves so little. The story has an old-fashioned feel and one could easily imagine it being made in the 1950s with someone like Victor Mature or Jeff Chandler. On the day that the god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is due to be crowned king of Egypt by his father Osiris (Bryan Brown) the latters bitter exiled brother Set (Gerard Butler) crashes the coronation kills Osiris seizes the crown and pulls out Horuss eyeballs. Then he announces to the soon-to-be-enslaved masses of Egypt that the rules for getting into the Afterlife are changing. ""My brother thought the Afterlife was a gift"" he sneers. ""From now on youll have to buy your way in with riches earned"" Then he adds ""It will be the yugest most luxurious Afterlife youve ever seen Itll make your head spin"" I might have made up that last part. The hero proper of the story however is Bek (bland bland Brenton Thwaites) a lowly mortal and thief who infiltrates Sets treasure vault and makes off with among other things Horuss magic eyeballs. And when his beloved Zaya (Courtney Eaton) is killed his journey gathers some urgency He wants the disgraced god along with the aforementioned Hathor to help save Zaya from vanishing into metaphysical nothingnesss. (She doesnt have the necessary wealth to get into the Afterlife. ""I have only my smile"" she adorably says to Anubis the jackal-headed god of that realm.) Yes the story is corny and old-fashioned and the castingA distressingly lily-white but visually the movie is in some ways of the moment. Director Proyas who once had a cult following thanks toA The CrowA andA Dark City can do wonders with elaborately imagined environments andA Gods of EgyptA has plenty of those Sets pyramid of sand a constantly shifting treacherous place with walls and stairs that keep blowing in and out of existence is a particular highlight as is a library populated by multiple manifestations of Thoth (Chadwick Boseman) the god of science and knowledge. Does it matter that its all so computer-generated that we might as well be watching an animated film? Im not sure. Both visually and narrativelyA Gods of EgyptA seems to be inspired more by video games than by Egyptian mythology. You dont really wonder what will happen next in this movie but you do wonder what setpiece or challenge it will throw at you next. Well video games and of course the superheroes that so dominate the current cinematic landscape; if Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury showed up at the end to recruit Horus into the Avengers I doubt many would even blink. Meanwhile Proyas and screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (who co-wroteA Dracula Untold a pseudo-mythical update that managed to be fairly entertaining) struggle to take these characters away from the stolid portent of yore and give them a modern-day playfulness. So we get some vaguely sexy banter between Hathor and Horus and even some cheeky bits of humor from Set. (""Can you make it taller?"" he asks his chief architect upon being shown the comically huge obelisk erected in his honor... before adding ""Relax Im joking."") But it all falls flat The dialogue is never irreverent or funny or particular enough to give these characters shape or dimension. It all feels like background banter. Gods of EgyptA isnt without its entertaining moments and to be fair it gets better as it goes along. But theres a fundamental disconnect between its attempts to mix likable life-size characters (figuratively speaking at least - the gods are actually about twice the size of the mortals which is actually a nice touch) with an ornate visually overwhelming universe thats part-myth part-Marvel and part-Playstation. Its not so much that it cant be done but the chasm between ambition and execution in this case is vast The characters feel anonymous and as a result this world has no weight or consequence. If it werent all CGI I would have said I hope they saved the sets for another better movie.

Courtesy Lionsgate A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Lets give Gods of Egypt this much An hour in a giant cobra crashes and explodes like a bad guys car in a dumb movie from the Seventies. That snake one of two in Alex Proyass film is wide as a locomotive and long as a parade. Its also straddled by a divine she-warrior who sends it crashing through a dead desert city in pursuit of a surfer-boy thief (Brenton Thwaites) and a giant blond god (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau embiggened by CGI.) Its dumb as hell but at least its an impassioned sumptuous dumbness.You can walk out of a dozen studio-produced FX debacles every year with the glum certainty that nobody involved at any step of production ever thought the movie might matter. The best moments of Gods of Egypt though play like the creators in their cracked way fully believe all this is awesome and cant wait to make you gape at it. I once toured a friend of a friends tricked-out fully carpeted sword-and-sorcery themed custom van and that experience was comparable to this one I wanted out pretty quickly but at least that dude was going for something.So Gods of Egypt. This is Clash of the Titans-style adventure hokum spiced with the pantheon of Ra and the directors bold interest in cleavage. As they strive to reclaim Egypt from the evil of Set (Gerard Butler) Coster-Waldaus Horus and Thwaites Bek road-trip through a universe as deep-dish geeky as the Asgard of that first Thor movie. We meet Ra himself played by Geoffrey Rush for some reason piloting a skiff far above the flat disc of earth with the sun towed behind him and we plunge into the maw of the billion-toothed space-worm that picks its once-a-night fight with him. We get some elaborate pyramid-raiding with too-busy death traps that suggest the filmmakers havent seen Raiders of the Lost Ark but have played Lego Indiana Jones. (The fighting while never distinguished is almost always legible to the eye.) We get tripped-out visions of the long slog a soul takes between death and the afterlife itself scenes that are inventive enough in their staging that they bust wide open the rule in these late-winter studio castoffs The CGI isnt convincing but for once its not unpleasing. That goes double for Sets flying chariot with its team of beetles.A good forty minutes of this movie are a goofy wonder the kind of thing you cant believe the producers spent so much money on. We see the god of wisdom (Chadwick Boseman) and his surplus of clone-like selves worry over what to name lettuce. We even see the sphinx a sandy and stomping man-lion pose its impossible riddle to the heroes. And maybe if you watch this at home with the subtitles on you might be able to work out just what that riddle and its answer could be. I couldnt catch that dialogue but here are a couple of doozies ripe for History of the World Part Two ""Im sorry that the corpses of my parents inconvenience you."" And ""Not worth the papyrus its written on""Perhaps the workaday plot and inane battles are the cost of all that sustained playful splendor. Gods of Egypts deity-versus-deity revenge story is entirely of this realm with stiff team-building and a protracted action climax involving hero and villain outfitted as falcon-like robo-men. (""Without both my eyes I cant transform"" complains Coster-Waldau his character demonstrating less grit in the face of loss than his Game of Thrones bastard.) Its human love story is even worse. The first time we behold Zaya (Courtney Eaton) Beks betrothed youll know that shes going to die soon; what other role does a dopey script like this have for the heros plus-one? As in most Cruise/DiCaprio movies the true love must die to motivate the man to action.This time though the filmmakers contrive a mythological excuse to keep her in the movie from beyond the veil which might seem like progress -- even as it gives the costume team the chance to whip up more of their ever-lower necklines. As bad movies go this one at least is all-in on its badness.

"Gods of Egypt | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gods-of-egypt ) Gods of Egypt (United States/Australia 2016) February 27 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli The concept of a movie being ""so bad its entertaining"" is often employed as a way of disparaging a film that doesnt work in the way the director planned. Its a valid description but the word to focus on is entertaining. Gods of Egypt is one of those movies. Although intended to be a mythology-inspired fantasy the movie works as a campy quasi-parody of the genre. Unfortunately director Alex Proyas shows no indication he understands what the movie really is so we as viewers have to do our own extrapolation. Gods of Egypt is often sloppy and fails in many ways but the cheesy momentum is hard to resist. The basic storyline fuses elements of Egyptian mythology with an original narrative that follows the quest of the god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Game of Thrones Jaime Lannister) to retake Egypt from the god Set (Gerard Butler) whose reign threatens to bring a storm of chaos on the world. Horus journey is fairly standard fantasy material and tracks Clash of the Titans well (as one might expect) but theres a fatal mistake. Instead of focusing exclusively on the gods the screenplay inserts a human being into the action. Hes Bek (Brenton Thwaites) a fresh-faced attractive young man whose capacity to irritate hovers close to Jar-Jar Binks territory. Bek is constantly whining about wanting to resurrect his dead girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton). For the good of the movie maybe he should have killed himself and joined her. For the actors theres no consistency of style. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau sees this as a fantasy adventure and plays Horus like a traditional hero-type. Gerard Butler regurgitates King Leonidas from 300 and spends most of his screen time stomping around waving his weapon preening and yelling. Geoffrey Rush as the sun-god Ra looks old and tired and may be wondering whether the paycheck was really worth it. He gives off a Marlon Brando-in-Superman vibe. And Breton Thwaites thinks hes in a Nicholas Sparks adaptation. Considering the awfulness of his performance its fair to question whether he just didnt bring his A-game or whether he doesnt have an A-game to bring. Hey but he looks dreamy. Which brings us to director Alex Proyas whose best days as a director (Dark City The Crow) are two decades in the rearview mirror. His most recent work 2009s Knowing (the Nicolas Cage apocalyptic tale) was an intriguing mess - a description that in some ways fits Gods of Egypt. Proyas obviously has an ambitious vision for this world and there are times when its effectively realized (the cityscape shots are impressive) but theres too much obvious CGI and after a while the artificiality becomes cumbersome. (Seeing it in 3-D only enhances the problems.) If one is going to make special effects the focus of a movie they need to be good special effects and thats not the case here. Proyas ideas are never fully translated from imagination to screen. Gods of Egypt should have been rated R. You can feel Proyas pushing the envelope and the PG-13 constraints hurt. The sex scenes should have been steamier - these are way too tame. The film is able to get away with more violence and bloodletting than one normally finds in teen-friendly films by making gods bleed gold. The MPAA is more forgiving of carnage as long as it doesnt involve copious amounts of crimson. I dont know whether Gods of Egypt would have been a better movie with lots of overt carnage and bare flesh but it would have felt less repressed. Still theres fun to be had (as long as you ignore Bek and Zara). The fight scenes are well choreographed and engaging. Although unevenly realized there are some interesting ideas here about how the gods and men interact. Gerard Butler is a hoot as long as you dont try to take him seriously. Seen in the right frame of mind (chemical enhancement optional) Gods of Egypt can work - if not on its own terms then at least on someone elses. Bad yes. But entertaining as well at least to a point.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Feb 26 2016 Culture Any review of Gods of Egypt should begin by noting two unrelated facts about the film. The first as has been widely discussed is that it dramatizes the ancient Egyptian myth of Osiris but features a starring cast of mostly white actors a move that doomed it to criticism and mockery months before its release and rightly so. The second is that in the film directed by the agreeably bonkers Alex Proyas the god Set (Gerard Butler) rides a chariot pulled by giant green flying beetles making the case that the movie is more than aware of its own absurdity.Related Story The Empty Spectacle of Exodus Gods and Kings Its hard to fathom which Hollywood executive decided that mining Egyptian mythology would produce a box-office bonanza but the films 140 million budget seems a clear indicator of faith that it would. As could only be expected Proyas--the director of spectacles like The Crow Dark City and I Robot--has harnessed that cash for a mad CGI circus. While the film is far too long (127 minutes) and far too silly to actually qualify as good viewers willing to accept the storys inherent stupidity might find some fun in the mayhem. After all where else could you see Geoffrey Rush playing the almighty Ra grow to 50 feet and drag the sun to the other side of a flat earth while shooting solar beams at an advancing chaos serpent bent on consuming him? That alone may not be worth the price of admission but Gods of Egypt seeks to justify itself by aiming for that kind of theatricality every five minutes.The plot is fairly simple The aging god-king of Egypt Osiris (Bryan Brown) decides to pass the throne to his son Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) but is usurped by his brother Set (Butler) the god of darkness who immediately begins to sow chaos in the kingdom. A weakened Horus joins forces with a mere mortal named Bek (Brenton Thwaites) to reclaim Egypt with help from the goddess of love Hathor (Elodie Yung) the god of wisdom Thoth (Chadwick Boseman) and grandpa Ra up in the sky riding his solar chariot and trying to ignore the squabbling of his godly offspring.The film conceives of the Egyptian gods as uber-celebrities who stand 10 feet tall but mingle among the humans who worship them. CGI trickery helps Coster-Waldau look considerably bigger than Thwaites every time they share the screen (which is a lot). It never looks natural but its frequently hilarious especially in a scene where Thoth grabs Beks face with a hand big enough to envelop his whole head. The gods are not only tall and beautiful--they also bleed molten gold and can transform at will into what can only be described as ... animal robots. To do battle Horus sprouts metal wings and turns into a giant robo-falcon like some ancient Transformer.Where else could you see Geoffrey Rush grow to 50 feet and drag the sun to the other side of a flat earth while shooting solar beams at an advancing chaos serpent bent on eating him?The presence of mortals is probably necessary to the overall plot but its a major drag in a film dominated by super-sized inhuman characters. Bek is boyishly handsome and charming but any time the Gods of Egypt concerned itself with his pitiful human desires I yawned. Coster-Waldau so rakish and dark as Jaime Lannister on Game of Thrones is stuck in blander territory as Horus who has to learn to be a little less cocky so that he can save the day. Butler and Rush seem more properly attuned to the films crackpot tone overacting in a way that complements the storys narrative and visual excesses.Butler is playing an Egyptian god who takes the form of a giant canine but he sticks pretty firmly to his natural Scottish accent perhaps realizing that the film is too far gone to worry about minor details like that. Rush should feel lost beneath the layers of old-man makeup and fiery graphics Proyas cakes him in but he really sells the grand daily grind of Ras celestial busywork. At one point Set shoots into the sky to visit him and the film cuts to Ra gingerly working the gears of his solar boat--that sun isnt going to set itself after all.After making sojourns to the desert an oasis the land of the dead and the chamber of a sphinx Gods of Egypt finally ends in a cacophony of action thats still practically impossible to comprehend. Like all of Proyass blockbuster efforts (including I Robot and the Nicolas Cage drama Knowing) Gods of Egypt gets lost in its own budget constantly shooting to outdo its visual grandeur but forgetting to lend it any depth. But theres a mad ambition at work thats harder to fault Scottish Egyptians notwithstanding.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Heres what that means for its strategy--and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

Sure why not Its all in surprisingly good fun. Amy Nicholson 02/26/2016 TheAmyNicholson Heres the moment Gods of Egypt made me its slave Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) grandson of the sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush) is about to be crowned king of Egypt by his popular father Osiris (Bryan Brown) who has given the region 1000 years of peace. In his last hours as a spoiled prince Horus is being massaged by three mortal attendants all half his size -- the gods are 12 feet tall -- when his girlfriend Hathor (Elodie Yung) the goddess of love saunters in wearing a blinged-out push-up bra and the two buff hotties start making out in a Jacuzzi. Id been rolling my eyes at the crop tops 3-D white rose petals and clangingly modern slang. Then I realized the joke was on stick-in-the-mud me. Screw museums. Director Alex Proyas (Dark City The Crow) is giving us the ancient Egypt we never knew we wanted to see one reimagined as a fantastical bloodbath in Las Vegas. In this vision of Egypt the gods are superstars the mortals their pathetic fans and the netherworld is the coolest club in town. When Osiris shouts ""All are welcome in the afterlife"" the civilians cheer like hes dropped the velvet rope to VIP. However an invite to the eternal party isnt that simple. Anubis (Goran D. Kleut) the dog-faced deity of death is the bouncer and after violent desert god Set (Gerard Butler) murders Osiris blinds Horus and claims the throne he raises the entrance fee. Good deeds are no longer enough. Now only the rich can buy their way into heaven. Cue Gods of Egypts grand CGI spectacular. Proyas who was born in Alexandria and moved away when he was 3 has clung to his boyhood obsession with his birthplace. To him the Egyptian gods arent dusty statues theyre badass action heroes who kick butt and crack jokes. Hes been given 140 million to play with his toys and hes put every penny on the screen. There are swooping pixelated vistas of the Nile and jaw-dropping shots of Ra in his flying space-boat dragging the sun around a flat coin-shaped Earth while pausing to fight a smoke worm with 10000 teeth -- the Egyptian god of chaos Apep. And when the gods fight which they do often they dont just box. They seize magic staffs that glow like light sabers transform into metal-plated falcons and duel in the sky. Gold -- not blood -- courses through their veins. When wounded they become even more glorious smeared in their own iridescent gore. Summit EntertainmentGods of Egypt has been called out for racial whitewashing particularly when it announced it hired Scottish Gerard Butler to play the villainous Set. Before I saw the film I agreed. Pretending the Middle East was solely populated by white faces is a problem especially in quasi-historical epics like last years Exodus Gods and Kings which cast Christian Bale as Egyptian-born Moses and slathered him in self-tanner. That movie took itself seriously as the truth -- or at least true-ish -- and expected audiences to trust it too. But Gods of Egypt is mythological mayhem. Forget about accuracy -- Butler doesnt hide his decidedly ahistorical accent. Hell his co-star Brenton Thwaites playing a clever mortal even chose to bleach his brown hair blonde (or really an unnatural shade of pumpkin that belongs on no man 5000 years old or not). By the time Butler bellows ""Im doing Egypt a favorrrrr"" in the same brogue hed use to order his fifth pint in Glasgow its clear Proyas reacted to the criticism by cranking everything up to surreal. (Honestly if people really want precision Osiriss skin should be green.) Besides Butlers so committed to Sets swagger and so clued in to the movies straight-faced bombast it becomes impossible to imagine another actor in the part. No one else would agree to slum it with such zest. In the midst of this madness Proyas has launched a new star French-Cambodian actress Elodie Yung whose imperious bedazzled and beautiful goddess of love Hathor is a walking hieroglyph for ""babe."" She knows it. When her ex Horus made blind and bitter by her new boyfriend Set accuses her of betrayal she preens ""Why would I waste this on someone who cant see?"" Yung is the latest great vamp in a line that stretches back to Theda Bara and Mae West; next to Eva Green shes the only living one we have. Instead of playing a passive object of desire -- which her character kind of has to be in a world where women are handed off like rewards -- she keeps control of her sexual confidence teasing nerd god Thoth (Chadwick Boseman) of being an ass man and seducing killer snakes just by batting her eyelashes. Shes an honest tramp. The first time Horus now one-eyed sees her in Set-purchased spangles he growls that shes wearing skimpy clothes to please his enemy. Hathor huffs ""I dress for myself."" I wouldnt buy that from any other girl in a metal bustier. I believe her. Its tempting to dismiss Gods of Egypt as the most perfectly bad film Ive ever seen. But thats not fair. Its perfectly itself -- a bizarre yet cohesive construction. You might not like Proyass melody but you cant say he hits a wrong note. I found myself dazzled not just by the pyrotechnics but by the feeling of watching a blockbuster that feels free from focus-group interference as though the studio shrugged ""Were probably losing money on this -- may as well crank it up all the way."" For a small film thats an accomplishment. For a 140 million trashterpiece its a god-given miracle.

(OscarsSoWhite has no relevance here since this is clearly an Academy no-fly zone.) Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush having fallen on hard times plays Ra the sun god whose head keeps bursting into flames when what should be burning is the agent who signed him up to do this career-crusher. Director Alex Proyas who showed early visual promise with The Crow and Dark City has clearly sold his soul to the gods of cheeseball computer-generated effects. No epic in recent times looks more pixalated or exerts more pain on the eyes. Oh sorry I lost track of the plot. Two gods are fighting. Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) lord of the air is trying to wrest the crown from his desert god uncle Set (Gerard Butler) who speaks in a Scottish burr. (That comes with the territory when you hire the Renfrewshire-born actor.) Coster-Waldau rolls his eyes so much at Butler presumably because of the accent that he gouges out his eyes. Its Set doing the eye-gouging on Horus not Butler on Coster-Waldau but you get my point. Meanwhile back on land with the mortals repped by the thieving Bek (Brenton Thwaites) theres a lot of fuss about famine and hard labor. These burdens prompt Bek to steal back one of Horus peepers though the lord of air looks quite rakish in an eyepatch and put the nice dude back in power. If you cant figure out the rest youve never seen a sword-and-sandals epic. Proyas clearly has however and hes cherry-picked the worst of the lot. But what raises Gods of Egypt above all other historically botched FX epics is the stupefying schlock of its visual effects from Ras shoddy starship to the digital monsters that take shape like something out of Video Aps for Dummies.

Download apps for your iPad  iPhone amp; iPod Touch  Android By Katie Walsh Tribune News Service  Friday February 26 2016 500 AM Ancient Egypt where the gods were white and spoke with British accents - as ""Gods of Egypt"" will have you believe. The movie most likely to be airbrushed onto the side of a van has rightfully taken quite the public drubbing for its whitewashing of a story with roots ostensibly in North African history. But truthfully the film is so ridiculously outlandish that it couldnt possibly be tied to anything in reality so its unfortunate that it borrowed a real place as a loose setting. Written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ""Gods of Egypt"" has a much lighter tone and clear willingness to embrace obvious campiness than their previous script the Vin Diesel vehicle ""The Last Witch Hunter."" Taking place in some random ancient time when mortals and gods co-existed the film starts with the coronation of god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) son of Osiris (Bryan Brown). Uncle Set (Gerard Butler) crashes the party from his desert outpost with an army to overthrow Osiris and take the kingdom for his own. Battling Horus he yanks out his powerful all-seeing eyes and banishes him to a dusty pyramid. Its essentially a sibling rivalry thing. Enslaving the human people and killing the gods who stand in his way Set starts building the pyramids and his powers. Young scrappy mortal Bek (Brenton Thwaites) wants to free his girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton) from her slavery so he decides to steal and return the eyes of Horus. Cheerful pickpocket Bek is not one iota different in character from Aladdin in Disneys ""Aladdin."" Having returned one eye the unlikely pair of god and mortal set off on a journey to return Horus to his rightful throne and save Zaya from the Land of the Dead. Thats the basic plot but ""Gods of Egypt"" is both so wildly incoherent and extremely silly that one is tempted to simply try to describe some of the weirder moments in director Alex Proyas movie. First the gods have been digitally enhanced to three times human size and are shot and staged as if they are giants. Also they bleed gold blood. In one particularly bonkers recurring set piece they visit the Sun God Ra who happens to be Human Torch Geoffrey Rush conscripted to a space ship that drags the sun on a chain around a flat disc-shaped Earth while he jousts a space worm chaos monster. Theres also a scene where the God of Knowledge Thoth (unrecognizable Chadwick Bozeman) pontificates on a head of lettuce surrounded by an army of his clones while bedecked in a sequined gown and headdress. Its positively ""Jupiter Ascending"" levels of operatic fantasy mania. Even though this is a 140 million project filled with movie stars beating up on it feels like punching down. It might be because ""Gods of Egypt"" is essentially good-humored and seems to have a modicum of self-awareness about its own shameless kookiness. It manages to slip just over the line into that sweet spot of awesomely bad even though it does overstay its welcome by about 30 minutes and none of its magical mumbo jumbo makes a lick of sense. That being said if youre under 13 years old or chemically-enhanced you just might have a blast.

Rated PG-13 (action violence sexuality). ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" ""300."" ""The Man Who Would Be King."" These are some films the makers of ""Gods of Egypt"" have seen. Unfortunately what they have made is more like the ""Battlefield Earth"" of sword-and-sorcery movies. Like the lobby of a Donald Trump building it looks ever so expensive and amazingly cheap at the same time. The ancient Egyptian fun begins when on the day the king (Bryan Brown) prepares to pass the crown to his son Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) he is instead murdered by his treacherous brother Set (Gerard Butler) who has unexpectedly returned from exile in the Scottish part of Egypt to seize power. In a ferocious battle in which Set and Horus suddenly shape-shift into metallic giant animals Horus winds up with no eyes which is how I wish Id gone into this movie. Luckily a mortal boy named Bek (Brenton Thwaites) an expert burglar manages to rescue one of the magical sparkling eyes from its place amid a deadly series of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-style traps. Horus eager to get his eye back tries to kill Bek but then secures the eye in a deal to try to retrieve Beks former girlfriend (Courtney Eaton) from the land of the dead. For Horus to exact his revenge against Set has something to do with killing the desert with a drop of magical water scooped up from -- where else? -- the spaceship captained by the sun god and Horus granddad Ra (Geoffrey Rush). Ra wearing his hair in a blond queue down the back of his neck and wreathed in a kind of Duraflame glow that makes him look like Olivia Newton-John in ""Xanadu"" spends his days protecting Egypt by firing his flamethrowing staff at a nefarious smog monster. Rush was Casanova Frankenstein in ""Mystery Men"" and the voice of Tomar-Re in ""The Green Lantern"" and yet I feel confident in declaring this a career low never to be eclipsed in a thousand lifetimes. But back in Egypt Horus and Bek join forces with the goddess of love Hathor (Elodie Yung) whom the former sportingly forgives for having shacked up with the villainous Set while Horus was away. They do battle with gigantic sand snakes that breathe fire but only when all prey is safely out of range. Assisted by the god of wisdom (Chadwick Boseman) a swishy fellow in a leather-and-gold nightie who enjoys contemplating the mysteries of lettuce and hangs around with a hundred clones of himself they confront the riddles of the terrifying sphinx who when bested cries ""Oh bother"" like Winnie the Pooh. Theres more. Much more and all of it seemingly dictated by the effects team presumably while high on mescaline. The script is left merely with tasks like randomly doling out unexplained new magical powers having characters turn into molten gold animals or shooing everyone along into the next set piece in the flaming-fortress puzzle-pyramid or the obelisk of doom. Assembling all of this into some kind of coherence is not the point; be dazzled or be damned. As one character puts it ""If I ever attempted to explain your brain would liquefy and run out of your ears.""

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 26 2016 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 26 2016 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Alex Proyas Written by Matt Sazama Burk Sharpless Starring Gerard Butler Geoffrey Rush Nicolaj Coster-Waldau Classification PG Genre fantasy Year 2016 Country USA/Australia Language English ""Gods bow before me. Mortals worship me or die.""Listening to Gerard Butlers villainous god of darkness go super tyrannical its apparent that the writers of the 140-million (U.S.) epic Gods of Egypt have either cribbed from professional wrestling scripts or from Kanye West tweets.Either way Butlers outrageously ambitious god is nine feet of total jerk one happy to destroy the world if thats what it takes to own it (Again the Kanye thing.) Directed by Australias Alex Proyas - responsible for The Crow and I Robot he isnt known for giggles - this campy 3-D spectacle features a love story among a pair of gleaming-teethed young mortals.Its set against a family power struggle between gold-bleeding Caucasian deities that really gets going when Butlers sandal-wearing badass steals the eyeballs and takes the throne of his new-king nephew (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as the lord of the air).Its all quest flash and high action after that but its hard to take it all nearly as seriously as the actors (including a braided-pony-tailed top-god-playing Geoffrey Rush in a spaceship) do.

Its silly fun grand ridiculous and stupid but never boring.Director Alex Proyas (""Dark City"") brings his visionary eye to this daffy tale of Gods kings myths and legends set in prehistoric Egypt.Its a mix of ""300"" ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""Prince of Persia"" all rendered to look like a video game. And its got a robe-clad Geoffrey Rush surrounded by flames as the sun god Ra which is more than last Februarys lofty yet laughable ""Jupiter Ascending"" had going for it.""Game of Thrones "" Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is Horus who goes to war with his uncle Set (Gerard Butler) after Set steals the Egyptian throne. Young Bek (Brenton Thwaites) teams up with Horus to defeat Set and save his love Zaya (Courtney Eaton) before she crosses over to the afterlife.It has the potential to be as lifeless as Ridley Scotts overblown slog ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" but it at least has a sense of humor about itself. Like when Thoth (Chadwick Boseman) standing in a room full of clones of himself asks ""how vain do you think I am?"" and all but winks at the screen.Set and Horus are gods and stand about two feet taller than mortals but Proyas can never quite get their heights right so they vary wildly from scene to scene. They also bleed gold and can transform into metallic warriors by using their powers of thought so dont count on ""Gods of Egypt"" for continuity points.No one is confusing ""Gods of Egypt"" with strong storytelling.

Gerard Butler is here displaying his mighty musculature in a manner reminiscent of his King Leonidas character in ""300."" Hes playing the villainous ancient Egyptian god Set a brother-knifing father-stabbing wife-mutilating deity who exults in his badness. Opposing him is his nephew Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) another slab of beef whose eyes Set yanks out early on. They continually crash and bash at each other sometimes as winged armored warriors crushing to computer-generated flinders the movies schlocky-looking palaces temples cities etc. Flitting around the edges of the mayhem is a smirky young human thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites looking like hes on his way to the prom) who wants Horus to retrieve his murdered sweetie (Courtney Eaton) from the land of the dead. No easy task for a sulking god (hey he misses those eyeballs). Offered the opportunity by Horus to be made a god himself Bek rejoins ""What would I be the god of? Stupidity?"" Bingo. Clearly an individual who knows his limitations. At one point Set rips the pulsing glowing blue brain out of the skull of the god of wisdom. Id say hed earlier done the same deed to ""Egypts"" filmmakers.

But thats good enough just like Eddie.The true story of how British plasterer Edwards overcame adversity and outfoxed Olympic brass to represent Blighty in ski-jump events at the Calgary games is certainly screen-worthy. But director Dexter Fletcher and screenwriters Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton arent interested in facts.Article Continued BelowThey invent two fictional ski coaches -- Hugh Jackmans whisky-soaked ex-champ and Christopher Walkens icy patriarch -- to embellish an already slippery narrative of Edwards who is played with stoic nerd appeal by Kingsmans Taron Egerton.The real Eddie was neither this big a klutz nor this inexperienced. But when the camera follows Egertons Eddie waaay up and down those heart-stopping jumps its hard not to cheer him on regardless.Peter HowellTriple 9Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor Anthony Mackie Casey Affleck Kate Winslet and Woody Harrelson. Directed by John Hillcoat. Opens Feb. 26 at GTA theatres. 120 minutes. 18AJohn Hillcoat packs a binge watch of characters and incidents into this corrupt-cop thriller. The Aussie assayer of macho mettle convenes Chiwetel Ejiofor Anthony Mackie Aaron Paul Clifton Collins Jr. and Norman Reedus as Atlanta police and ex-special ops gone bad.Theyre led by Ejiofors Terrell Tompkins who in turn is bossed by Irina Vaslov (a miscast Kate Winslet) head of a ""Kosher Mafia"" demanding that Tompkins crew pull off two high-risk heists. Failure to execute means execution for these failures and denied access to the son Tompkins has with his ex-partner Elena (Gal Gadot) Vaslovs sister.All this gets boiling before the title plot stirs the planned ""999"" felling of an officer as a diversionary tactic which will mix in Casey Afflecks noble lawman and stunt-casted Woody Harrelson as his boozy detective kin.So many moving parts and not enough meshing but Triple 9 has superb atmosphere and diverse acting to spare -- and Hillcoats a slam-dunk to direct a season of True Detective.Peter HowellThe MessengerDirected by Su Rynard. 89 minutes. Opens Feb. 26 at the Carlton. GYoull never look at Torontos brightly lit downtown skyline after dark the same way after Canadian director Su Rynards doc about songbirds in peril.Illuminated towers confuse the migrating birds which fly at night to avoid predators sending them crashing into the glass. Bags and bags of the brightly hued creatures are scooped by members of The Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP) from the sidewalk.Its part of Rynards global check into the dangers to some 20 billion migrating songbirds each year including noise pollution deforestation and French gourmands appetites. No wonder only about half the birds survive. Like the canary in the coal mine their health is a harbinger of human welfare.Gorgeous slow-motion footage of birds caught midflight against black backdrops is enthralling although the doc tends to flit between narratives.Linda BarnardGods of EgyptStarring Gerard Butler Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Brenton Thwaites Courtney Eaton Geoffrey Rush and Chadwick Boseman. Directed by Alex Proyas. Opens Feb. 26 at GTA theatres. 127 minutes. PGStudio Lionsgate and director Alex Proyas publicly apologized for Gods of Egypts lack of diversity although this is hardly the first Africa-set epic to use a mainly white cast.They should also fess up to CGI overkill and a dearth of originality in this ungodly jumble of a mortals-versus-deities rumble placed in the time before the pyramids were tourist attractions. Gerard Butler is amusingly evil as Set an immortal infidel who usurps Egypts throne from nephew Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in the OK opener. It all goes to hell in a chariot after that as Horus and nimble human thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) find common cause in challenging Set and chasing Beks endangered sweetie Zaya (Courtney Eaton). Cue fireballs and dust storms often.Too dull for camp and too slight for drama this time-waster unfurls under the glazed gaze of Geoffrey Rushs sun god Ra who orbits Earth in a baroque spacecraft. Lets hope his cheque cleared before this hits theatres.Peter Howell Read more about EgyptThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Share Tweet In Alex Proyas overlong and very silly Gods Of Egypt 10-foot-tall Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) playboy heir to the Egyptian throne gets his eyes plucked out by his apparently Scottish uncle Set (Gerard Butler) and must join forces with a thief to save all of creation by solving a bunch of puzzles. A treasure trove of gilded fantasy bric-a-brac and clashing accents Proyas sword-and-sandals space opera is a head above the likes of Wrath Of The Titans but it rapidly devolves into a tedious and repetitive succession of monster chases booby traps and temples that start to crumble at the last minute. If nothing else it makes one appreciate the artistry and economy that Paul W.S. Anderson brings to similar material and the genuine otherworldliness that the likes of Hercules In The Haunted World conjured up with a couple of light gels a fog machine and some foam rocks. Yet theres something to be said for Proyas effects-driven fantasy-kitsch vision of the surreal cosmology of Egyptian myth. Ra (Geoffrey Rush) who can grow bigger or smaller through the power of a constipated facial expression totes the Sun across the flat disk of the Earth on his spacecraft-like solar barque spending each night in battle with Apep the Lovecraftian ancient that dwells in the primordial abyss beyond the cosmic ocean. Snake-tongued assassins ride fire-breathing giant cobras that resemble the sandworms of Dune. The gods bleed gold paint over their gold armor in palaces inlaid with even more gold. There are chariots pulled by giant scarab beetles; sedan chairs carried aloft by hundreds of birds; staves that shoot red death-rays; gods who transform into glistening animal-headed robots and then throw each other at architecturally impossible buildings while the human rabble flees. Every dress has more plunging neckline than fabric.Starting with a long expository voice-over that brings to mind a video games opening cut scene Gods Of Egypt quickly moves to Horus coronation where Set arrives with an army of ruby-armored gold-masked soldiers to kill his brother Osiris and blind his nephew. For a time Gods Of Egypt seems to be introducing so many fantastical elements and baffling characters that it verges on becoming Proyas Jupiter Ascending minus the effective chase sequences. But soon it settles into a thoroughly uninvolving journey arc with Horus and Bek (Brenton Thwaites) plodding across jungle and desert in order to put out Sets eternal fire. Bek who doesnt worship the gods is in it because Horus has promised to rescue his girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton) from the afterlife. The grayish desert of the dead seems like a failure of imagination in a movie as visually busy as this though it does provide Gods Of Egypt with its one indelible image Bek and Zayas hands passing through each other like colored mists when he finally comes to find her.Proyas (Dark City The Crow) doesnt have a sense of staging that goes beyond putting the biggest object dead-center which makes the decision to make the gods a different size from the mortals a waste of an opportunity to play with visual scale. And yet one almost wants to rescue the movies extravagant high-fantasy paperback aesthetic--with its writhing monsters biomechanical wings and ogled cleavage--from the clutches of its screenplay. Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (The Last Witch Hunter Dracula Untold) tackle Egyptian myth the only way they know how as a wannabe franchise-starter that feels like it was adapted from a tabletop role-playing game with strict rules that need to be repeatedly stated out loud and a bestiary of creatures. There are dashes of corny humor--a lot of it involving the god of knowledge Thoth (Chadwick Boseman with an embarrassing accent)--but perhaps a movie like this is easiest to appreciate when its being stupidly serious.

Ancient Egypt Where gods and goddesses deign to live among humans and squabble over who should be in charge. Just as Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) Lord of the Skies is about to inherit the crown Set (Gerard Butler)--whose godly portfolio includes stirring up deserts making darkness and generally creating unpleasantness--ruins everything with a well-timed coup. Mere mortals Zaya and Bek (Courtney Eaton and Brenton Thwaites looking like escapees from a Justin Bieber/Selena Gomez biopic) are enslaved and a new reign of evil begins. Both Lionsgate and director Alex Proyas have already issued apologies for the predominately Caucasian casting choices a swifter mea culpa than the one Ridley Scott offered for Exodus Gods and Kings which cited budgetary concerns as the reason behind his color-blind picks. Still it seems as though a decent chunk of the Gods of Egypt budget went toward Butlers skin bronzer--money that would have been better spent on the cheap-looking special effects which appear to be culled from Ghostbusters II. Is Ra (Geoffrey Rush) channeling Vigo the Carpathian? This swords-and-sandals escapade couldve easily been milked for laughs but its handful of jokes delivered deadpan fall flat. Even a campy Chadwick Boseman performance comes off as heavy-handed and unwelcome. As the film totters to its predictable finale the closing moments set up a sequel a prospect far more terrifying than anything weve just seen.

Courtesy of Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Lionsgate Bek (Brenton Thwaites left) and Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in Gods of Egypt. Courtesy of Lionsgate All that glitters is not gold in the chintzy mythological adventure Gods of Egypt but most of it is -- a CGI jewel-box festooned with golden sands and towering spires golden spears and diamond-spackled bracelets and metallic wings that shimmer in the sun. Even the gods themselves once shivved in battle bleed out in resplendent puddles of liquid gold. Every penny of the 140 million budget certainly appears to be on screen but the experience is like being trapped in the lobby of an expensive but terrible hotel for two hours ensconced in nouveau riche ""class"" or witnessing an epic extrapolation of Elizabeth Taylors costumes in Cleopatra. To put it in marketplace terms The more gold there is the less value it has. The Cleopatra comparisons might stick to Gods of Egypt which has already been marked as a costly fiasco for Lionsgate just as the earlier film nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox. But Alex Proyas sword-and-sandal epic is primarily a casualty of 21st century digital effects. Those effects allow filmmakers the freedom to do anything but with the perilous side effect of defying physics making it anyones guess whether a punch or a fall is fatal or easily brushed off. Proyas a science-fiction specialist best-known for The Crow and Dark City seizes the opportunity to build a mythological Egypt where gods and mortals co-exist but the rules that govern this world are confusing and arbitrary. The effects fail in large part because the story itself gives them no gravity. In Proyas sprawling empire gods have lived peacefully among mankind for 1000 years but in a humanoid form thats significantly larger and transmutable. When the film opens the kingdom is set to be handed over to Horus (Game of Thrones Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) the god of air but his nefarious brother Set (Gerard Butler) the god of darkness has swept in from the desert to take the throne. After blinding Horus and exiling him to some faraway dune Set enslaves the people and forbids their passage into the afterlife unless they accumulate impossible wealth. That leaves a mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) to take heroic action by stealing back Horus magical eyes and teaming up with him to get the kingdom back. Thats the nutshell version of the plot. It gets much more convoluted Beks love interest (Courtney Eaton) has been slain by an arrow but the dead have to take a long purgatorial walk to the eternal gates so he might have time to convince Horus to call in a few celestial favors to bring her back to life. Then theres some business involving Horus and Sets grandfather (Geoffrey Rush) the god of the sun who rides through the heavens on a celestial sleigh atop waters of transformative power. There are fire-breathing flying serpents and giant steampunk contraptions and a series of mechanized traps that recall Raiders of the Lost Ark by way of the Prince of Persia platform game. The more that gets added on the more convoluted and nonsensical the film becomes. The closest Gods of Egypt gets to a credible relationship is the mismatched buddy-banter between Horus and Bek -- if as to credibility youre willing to overlook the fact that the actors bringing these two men of Egypt to life are Danish and Australian respectively part of a larger pattern in the cast for which Proyas apologized in November long before the films release. But Proyas investment in world-building takes precedent over all other considerations anyway. In that respect the film resembles George Lucas airless Star Wars prequels which play around in an dazzling sandbox of visual effects but seem incapable of communicating in language other than zeroes and ones. Many of the images in Gods of Egypt would make for a fetching prog-rock album cover but Proyas has populated his digital paradise with banal characters cherry-picked mythology and a score just a few notes off from Lawrence of Arabia. Out of the old comes nothing new.

So at least theres some historical precedent for the funky overripe 3-D folly Gods of Egypt - a shoddy special-effects howler that makes a hash out of both Egyptian mythology and human logic. Set in a glittering storybook past when the mighty gods lived alongside mortals the story kicks off with a heavy nod to Aladdin as our resourceful young ragamuffin hero Bek (The Givers Brenton Thwaites) shoplifts a cleavage-revealing dress in the crowded local bazaar for his dewy-eyed love Zaya (Mad Max Fury Roads Courtney Eaton). But despite their budding romance all is not copacetic along the Nile. Egypt is in crisis. The rival sibling deities Osiris (Bryan Brown) and Set (Gerard Butler) are feuding over the coronation of Osiris strapping son Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) as the new God of Gods. Before Horus can take the throne though the jealous Set kills Osiris plucks Horus eyes out and sends him into exile wresting power for himself and unleashing a ruthless reign of terror. But what about our young lovers you ask? Fate separates them of course as Zaya is mortally wounded and left hanging in a shadowy underworld limbo waiting for Bek to man up and rescue her. But hell need Horus help to save her. Cue the mismatched sword-and-sandal buddy-flick music. Because its directed by Alex Proyas Gods of Egypt shouldnt be half as silly and flat as it is. Until now Id always been a Proyas believer (and sometimes apologist) who connected with his dark moody visual style. The Crow (1994) was a good movie. Dark City (1998) was a really good movie. And Knowing was a totally solid entry in Nicolas Cages undiscriminating baroque period. But you would never know that Gods of Egypt was made by the same filmmaker. Theres no pulse beating within it. Its razzle-dazzle hackwork thats too tin-eared and dumb for adults and too long and tedious for kids. Its also just plain bonkers. Aside from a flying chariot drawn by gigantic winged beetles one of the movies signature visual gags is presenting the gods as super-sized giants with the mortals looking like Lilliputians next to them. An optical trick like this worked well enough with the pint-size Hobbits in Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings but it doesnt quite work here. Watching a towering bare-chested Coster-Waldau traipsing through the desert next to the puny Thwaites I couldnt stop thinking about that old Gilligans Island episode where Gilligan plays Jack and the Beanstalk doing sped-up figure-eights through the humongous legs of the lumbering Skippers Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum Giant. I think the tone that Proyas amp; Co. were aiming for here is the one that made the original Clash of the Titans such a nostalgic Saturday afternoon touchstone for so many fortysomething movie lovers a knowingly hammy illustrated history lesson served with a pinch of romance a dollop of swashbuckling adventure and a sprinkling of scary-but-not-too-scary villainy. But Gods of Egypt is neither good enough nor bad enough to qualify as a so-bad-its-good guilty pleasure. Its just there pounding you in the face with a cudgel of disposable mediocrity and schlocky videogame-grade CGI. Butler is all bearded brawn and beefcake bellowing his wooden lines with a ripsnorting Scottish burr that couldnt smack less of the Middle East. Coster-Waldau tries to lighten things up with some sarcasm but nearly pulls a muscle winking at the camera so hard. Thwaites is utterly generic. Chadwick Boseman turns the God of Knowledge Thoth into a bitchy eye-rolling pill. And Geoffrey Rush (with a mottled bald-cap and a sun-bolt staff) does exactly what you expect an Oscar winner to do in a film like this go big (at least until the check clears) and then go home. The female characters are too swept aside and thinly drawn to even bother commenting on - which come to think of it is probably the most historically accurate thing in the movie. Honestly you can learn more about the ancient world from the cover of Iron Maidens Powerslave album than in Gods of Egypt - a wannabe blockbuster whose biggest sin is that its just not very fun. Honestly the best that can be said about the movie is that at least its in focus.

Photo Credit Lionsgate advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In ancient Egypt a god and a mortal team up to defeat a power-hungry tyrant. CAST Gerard Butler Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Elodie Yung. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? RATED PG-13 (Action-violence gruesome imagery some sexuality) LENGTH 207 BOTTOM LINE A clunky fantasy flick enlivened by some unintentional camp. 131 MoviesGods of Egypt trailer The gods are literally larger than life in ""Gods of Egypt"" a subpar action-fantasy that nevertheless deserves credit for attempting a risky visual trick. Most of the actors play towering figures nine feet tall but they often interact with regular-size people. The result when the bigger guys share space with the littler guys is an oddly skewed perspective that resembles a funhouse optical illusion. Put on your 3-D glasses and youve got one weird moviegoing experience. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Gods of Egypt"" might have fared better without this gimmick though only by a little. For the most part its a derivative but amiable movie whose only goal is to entertain. If it didnt make you constantly wonder whether some actors are standing closer to the camera than others ""Gods of Egypt"" might pass muster as an occasionally lively and frequently campy B movie. The lively part comes from Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (HBOs ""Game of Thrones"") as the god Horus a Prince Hal figure soon to be king of Egypt. His debauched lifestyle includes wild orgies and a harem of mortal women. (Here again the size difference raises distracting questions.) Coster-Waldau makes an appealing rogue and his pirate-style eye-patch is an amusingly loopy touch. The campy part begins when Gerard Butler enters as Set an Egyptian god with a noticeable Scottish burr. Butler excels at roles like this all muscle and bluster and he doesnt hold back here as a jealous son craving his fathers empire and approval. Whos his father? Glad you asked because its Geoffrey Rush as the sun god Ra mugging shamelessly while his head is in flames. Anthony Hopkins gave the father-figure in ""Thor"" a bit of Shakespearean class but Rush goes for silent-era hysteria. Its an admirably gonzo performance. Less fun are Brenton Thwaites (""Maleficent"") as the mortal Bek who joins Horus in a quest to conquer Set and Courtney Eaton as his true love Zaya. Theyre serviceable but not terribly convincing -- a bit like the miniature sets and green-screen action-scenes that give this movie an oddly dated look. MoviesThe movies you have to see in 2016 Energetically directed by Alex Proyas (""The Crow"") but clumsily written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (""The Last Witch Hunter"" a rather better movie) ""Gods Of Egypt"" wavers between unintentional hoot and mere mediocrity. Or maybe thats a matter of perspective.

Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays Horus in ""Gods of Egypt."" Photo Lisa Tomasetti Associated Press Gods of Egypt an epic ... disaster 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Gods of Egypt"" is an epic -- an epic disaster. It has a director of flair and visual intelligence Alex Proyas but a script that should never have been filmed. It should never have been read. Upon completion someone should have set up a reasonable perimeter and sent in a bomb squad. This one had bomb written all over it. It takes place in an ancient Egypt that never existed in which gods and men live together with the gods in charge. In this world there is a good king (Bryan Brown) and then there is a very very bad king (Gerard Butler) whose name is Set. Its hard to say what made Set so evil but having a verb for a name probably didnt help. Its curious (and only fair) to note that the opening isnt terrible and even seems promising. Were introduced to a pair of adorable young lovers Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and Zaya (Courtney Eaton) whose lives will be affected by the days political struggle. And then we see the beginnings of that struggle with Set showing up at the coronation of his nephew Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) with an army. Not happy with oppressing half the known world Set now wants the whole thing. The idea of making the gods twice as tall as people allows for some amusing visual touches and also makes it easy to track at all times who is a god and who is not. But very soon this hardly matters. Very soon -- remarkably soon almost before you can blink an increasingly heavy eyelid -- the movie becomes tiresome and then worse than that. ""Gods of Egypt"" induces a weird stupor a feeling akin to just coming out from anesthesia. I spent half the film expecting my doctor to come in and tell me how the colonoscopy went. A combination of two things makes ""Gods of Egypt"" hard to sit through. The first is that within 20 minutes the audience knows exactly what will happen. The second is that nothing is done to make the audience care how it happens. Horus and Bek set off on an improbable journey to retake the kingdom but they never shut up about it and their banter is witless as though the real mission were to keep arguing so as to make the movie longer. With no real action taking place -- action in the sense of plot movement -- Proyas feels obligated to create fake action in the form of dazzle and commotion at every opportunity. But such action is merely the visual form of banter a bombardment of stuff that has no point and no capacity to engage. Meanwhile not one character in the whole film ever surprises us even the villain who just acts like a villain every second hes onscreen. Butler charges around flexing his muscles and growling maybe throwing in a few snarls and snorts and hes nothing but boring. Hes the best thing in the movie. No one ever says anything interesting. Instead every minute or two someone gets off a pithy number like this one ""Since you have been king the need for burial shrouds has been greater."" They sure talked funny in ancient Egypt. Clearly there were comic possibilities here that no one bothered to explore. With just a tiny extra push into the ridiculous this dreadfully earnest 127-minute slog could have been made into a caustic 90-minute satire.

Thats a question that Egyptian god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ""Game of Thrones"") poses to mortal Bek (Brenton Thwaites ""The Giver"") and as far as ""Gods of Egypt"" goes that answer would be a resounding ""No."" A mishmash of unconvincing visual effects and clumsy writing -- not to mention another depiction of ancient Egypt in which the lead roles are almost all played by white folks -- ""Gods of Egypt"" might have merited a so-bad-its-good schadenfreude fanbase had it maintained the unintentional laughs of its first 10 minutes. Instead it skids into dullness thus negating the camp classic that it so often verges on becoming. See Video Gods of Egypt Trailer Sees Gerard Butler on a Path of Destruction In an opening that feels borrowed from Disneys ""Aladdin"" thief Bek steals a dress from a merchant in a crowded bazaar so that his wife Zaya (Courtney Eaton ""Mad Max Fury Road"") will have something nice to wear to the ceremony where Horus will inherit the crown of his father Osiris (Bryan Brown). But the movie soon switches to ""Lion King"" mode with Osiris brother Set (Gerard Butler) killing Osiris and blinding and banishing Horus for good measure. Horus stews in self-pity ignoring the prayers of his followers until Bek manages to steal back one of the gods eyes. Zaya dies in their getaway chariot and Bek tells Horus hell help him get his other eye in exchange for bringing Zaya back from the Land of the Dead. Horus agrees to the deal even though he knows he cant deliver on it. Also Read Ava DuVernay Reacts to Gods of Egypt Directors Casting Apology Bek is mainly around as a sidekick and a plot device -- the real story here is about how Horus learns to be less of a schmuck and to pay attention to humanity. The real real story however is how director Alex Proyas (""Dark City"") and his production team have managed to make every last shot of this movie look like bad green-screen. Most Pixar movies do a better job of making the eye forget that its watching something completely artificial; never for a moment did I stop thinking about post-production processing. Next to ""Gods of Egypt"" ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" is ""The Revenant."" And if the actors have a fuzzy aura when theyre just standing there the effects get even deadlier when the gods turn into flying dog creatures or bull-men fight Horus in a mountainside waterfall. The quality of this computer-generated animation ranges from ""free-download video game that advertises in the margins of Facebook"" to the legendarily catastrophic ""Foodfight"" The screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (""The Last Witch Hunter"" ""Dracula Untold"") gives the cast the opportunity to bellow lines like ""Mortals worship me or be enslaved"" but the performances make you miss the consistently plummy British-ish accents that youd get in an old Cecil B. DeMille Bible epic. ""Gods"" offers a mix of Australians (Brown Eaton and Thwaites plus Geoffrey Rush -- sporting a French-braid Mohawk -- as Ra) French (Elodie Yung as a love goddess) and Americans (Chadwick Boseman gives his first bad performance as a fey self-impressed Thoth god of wisdom). Also Read Gerard Butlers The Headhunters Calling Casts Maxwell Jenkins (Exclusive) And then theres Gerard Butler whose untamped Scottish accent buries every line of his dialogue under the Pyramid of Groundskeeper Willie. A touch more self-awareness might have rendered his performance an elaborate inside joke but as it is he struts and frets across the screen with a misdirected intensity that like the movie itself goes from hilarious to tedious.

"Gods of Egypt review A mortal folly - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Gods of Egypt review Mortals combat deities audience loses Gods of Egypt Trailer Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Go Head-to-Head Gerard Butler is the merciless God of Darkness in Gods of Egypt. Gerard Butler is the merciless God of Darkness in Gods of Egypt. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Wow Where to start? The effects-driven (into the ground) ""Gods of Egypt"" is so screwy yet so lame its already-infamous whitewashed casting issues are the least of its troubles.As we hear in the opening voice-over in a line recycled from any number of 50s TV variety shows featuring Sammy Cahn or Johnny Mercer the story ""goes something ... like ... this"" Ancient Egypt see? Were in ancient Egypt mythological division. Anything can happen here. The place looks like a Bahamas resort being built next door to Atlantis connected by a lazy-river version of the Nile. The gods roam the land freely and in fact rule it alongside the mortals. The gods also bleed liquid gold and run 11 12 feet in height on average. In one scene a particular god is shown lounging in a swimming pool attended by mortal babes and he looks like a first-round draft pick in the Ancient Mythological Basketball Association.Godwise big cheese Osiris (Australian native Bryan Brown whos not even the pastiest-whitest cast member on screen) is about to bequeath the kingdom to his benevolent son Horus (Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and even he isnt the pastiest-whitest). But the war-mongering brother of Osiris shows up; hes mean ol Uncle Set played by Scottish-born Gerard Butler and Set is set on causing a tsuris for Osiris. He kills him and the queen and yanks out the shining blueish-white eyeballs of Horus for good measure. The rest of ""Gods of Egypt"" relays how Horus gets his orbs and his kingdom back. This he accomplishes with the help of lowly but plucky pickpocket Bek played by Aussie Brenton Thwaites who seems to have wandered over from a predynastic period version of ""Glee."" Theres no enlightened way to put this Despite a blizzard of cruddy-looking digital effects utterly belying the rumored 140 million production budget the primary visual focus of ""Gods of Egypt"" is the bejeweled cleavage of Courtney Eaton (as Beks beloved Zaya) and Horus squeeze Hathor. The actresses are secondary if that. Hathor is portrayed by Elodie Yung who is of French-Cambodian ancestry and therefore about as Egyptian as these folks get. Gods of Egypt Lionsgate Courtney Eaton center left and Brenton Thwaites center right in a scene from ""Gods of Egypt."" Courtney Eaton center left and Brenton Thwaites center right in a scene from ""Gods of Egypt."" (Lionsgate) The script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (""Dracula Untold"" and ""The Last Witch Hunter"") is lousy with asides meant to amuse. ""This old thing?"" Hathor purrs at one point dangling a magical bracelet from her wrist somewhere northwest of where director Alex Proyas camera is actually pointed. This U.S./Australian coproduction also features Geoffrey Rush and a lot of digital flames as Ra the sun god who can shoot fireballs at giant serpents.Theres little to say of the combat sequences beyond noting their numbing repetition and hacky nervous editing strategy. And honestly the castings the least of the issues in ""Gods of Egypt"" though the films distributor Lionsgate wasted no time with the mea culpas. ""It is clear that our casting choices should have been more diverse"" director Proyas said in a statement months ago. A Lionsgate spokesperson added ""We failed to live up to our own standards of sensitivity and diversity for which we sincerely apologize.""

TWITTER 2/26/2016 An Egyptian god battles his vengeful uncle with the aid of a mortal in Alex Proyas fantasy-adventure film. Oh dear. Arriving just days before the all-white Oscars is a fantasy-adventure film set in an ancient Egypt almost entirely populated mortals and gods alike by Caucasians including Gerard Butler. After all when you imagine an Egyptian god the first thing you think of is a burly Scotsman. But thats only one of the many problems of Summits Gods of Egypt a movie which seems inspired by a video game even though it wasnt. This overstuffed witless and bloated stillborn 140 million epic is unlikely to spawn the studios intended franchise -- unless as is so often the case international audiences come to the box-office rescue. Directed by Alex Proyas (coming a long way down from the likes of The Crow and Dark City) the film begins with a voiceover narrator attempting to explain whats going on. He neednt have bothered. It seems that the god Osiris (Bryan Brown one of many Aussie thespians in the largely Sydney-shot film) is about to coronate his son Horus (Nikoaj Coster-Waldau) as the new king. The ceremony is interrupted by the arrival of Horus uncle Set (Butler) who comments ""Its a big day for the family"" as if it was a bar mitzvah. Intent on seizing the kingdom from his nephew the big bad Set -- actually all of the gods are big looming several feet over the mortals as if theyd been shot up with scads of human growth hormone -- promptly murders his brother and engages in a brutal battle with Horus. ""You fight well -- are you sure youre his son?"" taunts Set in one of his many ""Oh snap"" moments. Not long after he settles the matter by ripping out Horus eyes which are transformed into glowing orbs. Alternately were introduced to the supposedly charming young thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites looking genetically designed to be a teenage girls screensaver) and his beautiful girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton). Shes the slave of Urshu (Rufus Sewell) Sets chief architect -- because hey even gods need to outsource. When Zaya is killed during Beks attempt to rescue her the grief-stricken young man proposes a deal with Horus now depressed and drinking too much. If the god will bring Zaya back to life Bek whos retrieved one of his eyes from Sets vault will help him reclaim his crown. And thus begins an increasingly outlandish series of special effects-laden action sequences in which the pair battle such creatures as two giant serpents piloted by sexy female gods who along with all of the other women in ancient Egypt seem costumed by Victorias Secret. Along the way theyre joined by Hathor (a commanding Elodie Yung) the goddess of love who has a knack for getting males of both the god and human variety to do what she wants. Among the other gods making brief appearances are Anubis (Goran D. Kleut) the canine-headed god of death who escorts Zaya into the afterlife; Thoth (Chadwick Boseman probably relieved to not be starring in a biopic) the god of wisdom who seems awfully full of himself; and Ra the sun god whose duties include camping out on what looks like a giant spaceship and engaging in a nightly battle with a cosmic worm. The last character frequently shown as being on fire is played by Geoffrey Rush whose career judging by this clearly isnt. Its all as ridiculous as it sounds and yet somehow Gods of Egypt doesnt even manage to be campy enough to be an entertaining guilty pleasure. Partly its a result of the extensive CGI effects which although elaborate and obviously expensive still manage to look cheesy. Any five minutes of a Ray Harryhausen-designed stop-motion sequence is more magical than everything on display here. Butler his skin unfortunately darkened as if he was spending too much time at the tanning salon with John Boehner seems to be going through the motions. Coster-Waldau fares better although between this and Game of Thrones he must be wondering if hell ever be allowed to wear pants. By the time the seemingly endless pic lurches toward its final moments designed to set up a sequel viewers will have long since concluded that the afterlife looks pretty good by comparison.

At a certain point in ""Gods of Egypt"" an extravagantly silly foray into Afroasiatic mythology from the director Alex Proyas one wounded deity begs another to show him mercy -- a futile request as far as his enemy is concerned but one that may strike a more receptive chord with the compassionate viewer (which is to say any viewer who would buy a ticket to ""Gods of Egypt""). Since the film enters theaters already in its death throes -- undone by toxic word of mouth much criticism of its predominantly white cast and an opening-weekend box office projection of about 10% of its 140 million production budget -- perhaps a little kindness would not be misplaced. So here goes This is by any measure a dreadful movie a chintzy CG-encrusted eyesore that oozes stupidity and self-indulgence from every pore. Yet damned if Proyas doesnt put it all out there with a lunatic conviction you cant help but admire immediately earning this Lionsgate release a place in the 2016 pantheon of gloriously watchable follies. With its burnt-yellow cinematography its excessively gilded production design and its blinding flashes of sunlight ""Gods of Egypt"" at times doesnt suggest a movie so much as a giant cinematic tanning salon -- all the better perhaps to darken the pearlescent skin tones of most of the actors on display (an effect that can be further enhanced with your purchase of murk-maximizing 3D glasses). The opening scene sweeps us over the streets roofs and pyramids of ancient Egypt a prosperous kingdom ruled over by the wise and benevolent Osiris (Bryan Brown). For centuries Osiris has allowed his lowly mortal subjects to dwell in harmony with the gods who tower over everyone thanks to the latest advances in digital height-modification technology. Everything changes however at the coronation of Osiris son Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) also known as the Lord of the Air. In storms Osiris jealous brother the desert god Set (Gerard Butler) who promptly murders the king in full view of the horrified public then defeats his nephew Horus in a duel and gouges out his eyes. It all happens so quickly and with such dynamic ""Virtua Fighter""-style whooshings of the camera that you barely have time to register such head-scratching details as say the fact that Set is way too young to be Osiris brother or the hilariously unexplained provenance of Butlers Scottish accent. But dont think too hard about it. Its magic Related Box Office Gods of Egypt Falling Flat Deadpool Still King Some time later Set has established a new reign of terror in which mortals once free to enter the afterlife must now buy their way in with treasure. Meanwhile said mortals have now been sentenced to a lifetime of hard labor including Bek (Brenton Thwaites) a wily handsome and quite boring young thief who dreams of freeing Horus from his self-imposed exile. And so with the help of his fetching lover Zaya (Courtney Eaton) and under the nose of Sets right-hand man Urshu (Rufus Sewell) Bek breaks into the palaces booby-trapped vault and steals back one of Horus eyes. Now sporting a sexy eyepatch the Lord of the Air determines to seize his revenge against Set and take back the crown. First however Horus must address a few complications such as the fact that his former squeeze Hathor (Elodie Yung) is now bedding down with his nemesis; their love nest is strategically positioned next to a towering obelisk that underscores Sets lust for conquest and his nagging infertility issues. Hathor incidentally is described in the production notes as ""the goddess of love music and alcohol"" which means that she presumably would be in a position to do something about Marco Beltramis epically tumescent score or at least to ensure that no one walks into ""Gods of Egypt"" without a beer in hand. In a movie where the deities transform at will into winged animal-headed Hasbro figurines or where Geoffrey Rushs white-robed sun god Ra reliably bursts into craptacular CG flames the drinking games pretty much write themselves. Coming off ""I Robot"" and ""Knowing"" Proyas hasnt exactly been in his element for a while but every so often the elaborate kitsch and clutter of his visual design clears away for the sort of striking effect that reminds you of the impassioned fantasist who gave us ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"" -- a small sandstorm that becomes a portal between the lands of the dead and the living or the enormous proto-Starship Enterprise that Ra navigates through the heavens every night doing battle with what appears to be a thunder cloud with teeth. At times the camera stays still long enough for you to take in the details of Liz Palmers ornately bejeweled costumes though unfortunately this also gives you time to study the almost surreal disconnect between foreground and background in every artificial-looking frame. As ever Proyas doesnt skimp on spectacle though its a disappointment when the Sphinx inevitably shows up and disgorges her riddle; you want to tell her to either slow down and enunciate or get the hell back to Vegas. The movies action highlight finds two evil goddesses Astarte (Abbey Lee) and Anat (Yaya Deng) chasing after Horus and Bek on enormous fire-breathing cobras forcing our mismatched heroes to put their heads together. Coster-Waldau and Thwaites manage a passable bickersome on-screen chemistry that drives the movie toward its big moral epiphany which is the importance of treating even ones so-called inferiors with decency as Horus slowly learns to see the worth of his mortal subjects and the entwined nature of their destinies. But really who is ""Gods of Egypt"" kidding? Like so many of Hollywoods sword-and-sandal offerings this interminable ersatz epic consigns most of the human race to a sea of digital extras while subjecting its immortal characters to more than two hours worth of big-screen deification. Butler looking and sounding so out of place you may wonder if hes doing early cross-promotion for ""Cairo Has Fallen"" nonetheless perfectly embodies the crass ham-fisted sensibility of the enterprise Hed be chewing the scenery if you could chew green screen. Not to be outdone in the weird-accent department Chadwick Boseman glares and snarks up a storm in the role of Thoth the haughty and imperious god of wisdom. If he knows why this movie exists hes not telling. Film Review Gods of EgyptReviewed at AMC Century City 15 Feb. 24 2016. MPAA Rating PG-13. Running time 127 MIN.

Nicole Bay says July 19 2016 at 622 pm Please research and if youre black and reading this. Please dont believe Ancient Egyptians were White. They were indeed Dark skin completion and different shades just as today Our history was white washed by the Vatican. Its just one Google search away. The writings on the walls in the tombs dont lie and they show the truth. Please watch a movie named "" Hidden Colors"" We are the indigenous people of this plant. The Black woman is the giver of life. Black/dark completion whos women birth nations. People of all shades of brown..The black woman also can birth a White child. No white woman can produce a black child. Yes thats right Its called Melanin everything from this earth has it as protection from the Sun its gives US energy. Just think how could white people survive the SUN they need a man made solution of chemicals just to be in the SUN come on now Stop it with the lies ANTIENT EGYPTIONS WERE BLACK The hieroglyphics dont lie its been there for thousands of years This is the main reason our culture is confused is because the Romans stole our History and claimed it for theirs. How can we claim an African culture they made sure we wouldnt know the truth. We are descendants of Royalty. But now we are getting more conscious. The Caucasian race were living in Caves in the Caucus mountains hence the name CAUCASION. They were savages not bathing didnt know how to talk dirty and disease famine.. They steal everything research why their history starts with the Roman Empire they cut off the heads of the Ancient Egyptian sculptures and replaced with fake heads to depict them. Dont take my word for it look it up. Oh and the Egyptians of today have been mixed so much yes they are all lighter Now. Reply Miketx says June 2 2016 at 123 pm SO you dont like the movie because there are to many white people in it? I guess Ill have to buy it then. Reply Jupiter says May 24 2016 at 551 am Movie critics really dont make any sense most of the time. Cant they just say if its good or not in 30 words or less? lol no wonder you so much people hate critics. They always tryin to act ""god"". Reply Jule Bykiarr Dontpanic Reset says May 18 2016 at 639 pm I think it is a bit shy in presenting itself as a single movie with no legacy on continuing and not splitting some scenes with more script more dialogue especially on the initial part that it presumes that everybody are acquainted with the story of the gods of Egypt bek-pek look a lot alike young Luke Skywalker thrown away from its hole way too fast without any concern about the giant gods the pyramid - sound machine part also was interesting but it dissolved in a papyrus and the idea wasnt explored it got this indiana parts also that looked cool but way too easy play god mode next time Reply Elizabeth says March 31 2016 at 902 am Most of the characters are supposed to be GODS they can look like what ever they want they are SUPPOSED to be huge and ""look artificial"" because they are not of this world. No one had a problem with Asgard in the Thor movies. It was beautifully done though I did notice a conspicuous lack of actors who looked in the least bit Middle Eastern/Mediterranean/North African. The quips were amusing and the characters actually had a little depth instead of being walking tropes. Mythology is a fascinating realm and we finally have the technology to explore it in a really awe-inspiring way. Does anyone appreciate that theyre trying to represent super-human supernatural beings here? Does anyone care that theyre trying to address the philosophical issue of why bad things happen to good and innocent people? Does anyone care that the boat of the sun was freaking awesome? I guess what goes for superheroes in Marvel moves is okay but in any other movies its just ""trash."" Reply Teo Tioliendo says February 29 2016 at 1258 pm Artist Artist Movie Review By Teo Tioliendo In a time where black youth and their current street culture has created such a lost generation that values only itself and show respect in slang profane muzic and love of little to none of what has been created in our culture by our belonging to a great past we are given in the vice of fantasy imagination and entertainment a distortion of history to a world that is still learning about the true histories of Africa and its effects upon the soul of the nations of the earth even today. Our people want to take pride in all that represents the greatness of Africa even the part that served to bring forth a better world as it served Gods purpose concerning the biblical depiction of Egypt and the spiritual destiny of man as it stood against the biblical history of Africa that stood with the predestined path that Africas descendants would have in moving forward a world before the birth of Christ and help the world to witness the Glory of God in his overcoming slavery idolatry of the world and death. Africa Afriqans Egypt and black people in America and the world bear witness to this history that tells our story that God by grace blessed the world as he freed us freed the Jews freed the Africans-black people sons and daughters of Noah in a time of sin being freed from worship of idols as gods freed to go froth to a time where there would be human and animal sacrifice no more as the prophecy of Christ was fulfilled in Jesus bringing us out of darkness into the light of truth blessing us with great gifts that we share with the world in art muzic and battle against evil and continue to tell our true story to the glory of God. But as were told of the time to come of a generation that would be led astray by mans own devices a misrepresentation of blacks by the sin of omitting of the true people of Egyptian ancient history an offense however black are representative for the sake of the movie itself. Napoleon removed Egypt from the maps of the world once in the great books written about Afriqa at the time of his infamy the world put Egypt back for the historical truth that Egypt is a part of Afriqa to be known for future generations that included our generation and the black youth of today. A movie that stands as another misleading representation of black peoples greatest civilization called even in the time of Christ resurrection to the Gospel is very troubling as black youth today are disconnected from the wisdom of truth in knowing its history and value in knowing of such parts of Africa Egypt being part of black history which crossed 7 thousand year of African pharaohs. Playing with this history is one of the most dangerous and arrogant acts of film making today though Gods of Egypt is an incredible film making feat standing strong in its use of classical epic music orchestration in composition of its sound track reminiscent of the sound track for the 10 Commandments with special effects that are modern in the battle scenes as the best graphic novels today yet futuristically juxtaposed against pre-dark ages magic that is feels allegorical and echoes of cosmic Egyptian astrological mysticism in an amazing tale of fantasy that an unknowing child would believe with all magical thinking to be true if never taught otherwise by history of black culture and the Afriqans of Egypt who created ruled and perished and survive in its artifacts and descendants today from the time in its past. Gods of Egypt and film based on true stories have served to educate elevate and enhance knowledge in truth history by the principle of the story based on a true-story-tradition of film making. But in the license of doing whatever we want with our devices for entertainment and profit movies are abounding in evil leading people into hardness of heart alienation from their own culture and darkness that is an eclipse of the truth where the power of God seems to be left out in such times moments in movies as if any power of God can be left out of the consequences of the actions of people whether in the arts in labor or in historic or religious depiction of the life and the spiritual life of the people of the world of light upon the musical earth. Whether it is films making movies or recording music and writing scripts it is all the sowing on earth what is our own destiny in heaven. Such imaginings of disrespect with the film art has gone so far with such dishonor and disrespect of the flesh-people the body even the blessings of color concerning people of the earth in such movies. This is true in the making of movies of history war horror realistic terror giving mans use of his sovereign will (strong will-free will) to do whatever he wants. But truth demands we use our sovereign will to be great do great things for us all. Getting away with distorting a peoples history as being acceptable in fiction and art even in film making is an illusion to believe that Release of films like Gods of Egypt does not have yet to carry the responsible for historical misrepresentation of a people based on color who have historically been judged and destroyed and freed because of color in wars and by the power of biblical truth for such creation for entertainment thrills and actions in film art. There must never be an abandonment of respect for Gods Word commandments biblical history even as it is written of Egypt and its calling to follow Christ instead of the people of the veil-those whose souls are tied to religious rather than Gods law and grace. The universal appeal of Gods of Egypt for all its spiritual and biblical untruth is its mythical portrayal and romantic glorification of gods a forbidden act that promotes idolatry unbelief and echoes of the denial of Egypts place in the Romanticized stories of this great civilizations as being possible with its true people as the subjects of this great ancient past also a part of our biblical past. Tales of terrorism in Egypt today has taken away its being believed to be capable of having its place as a Christian nation of destiny by some people. But all over the world many who were not are being called and converted blessed to become Christians. As Gods of Egypt for the sake of the blockbuster it was made to become reveals by its denial of God the role of black people in shaping the world for all its knowledge of good and evil a part of ancient Egypts history the most ancient truth biblical truth is ever revealing giving us the enlightened black mind that comes of the truth about black people and the world thanks to Gods incredible wisdom as the only truth we can rely upon. Such a movie stirs up race consciousness in a time when we take a moral leap forward having new knowledge of the biblical revelations of the blessings of color that are spiritual not racial where romance and sexual myth are overcome about blacks and sex and love as we have learned we were blessed from our beginning as children of God by the covenant of love soul ties for love that were meant to be. We resist reject lies even a good liar in a good piece of film making like Gods of Egypt. Our souls are not tied to myths but to the prophets Christ and God in history not movie fantasy based on our history of myths though our minds are entertained by the tale as in the Odyssey being seduced by this style visualization the poetic license the work of fiction regardless of its historical leaving out the true place and portrayal of events of ancient people the Africans who even in ancient Egypt with its gates open to every kind of people worshiping all manner of gods oracles pagan life that reaches such heights that will never reach the truth. Gods of Egypt is not about the history of Africa though it uses the essential remnants symbols of artistry regal figures of Egypts history and royal past in history and from their religious beliefs. Beliefs in the afterlife use of sorcery echoing but aesthetically leaving out the subject of mummification that is the anti-romantic quality of telling of the most important figures of Egypts past magic and the powers attributed to gods of their beliefs. Gods of Egypt denies however the Afriqan as primary in Egypts history and even presents a black man as a God of wisdom that falls short in his so called perfect imperfect wisdom. Gods of Egypt gives Egypts gods presence that is visualized in very familiar ways leaving out the One God and the children of God who were in Egypt along with all people of earth in Egypt during the height of its civilization for reasons of commerce who were ruled under and worshiped their pagan gods and were a part of biblical history before the birth of Christ. Afriqas story must be told was of the oral tradition spoken and as a part of the black literary tradition today written and taught for edification of all people of earth on what happen to Afriqans in the world that we all bear witness the Glory of God in his overcoming the sin of slavery and the sin of death and our receiving the gift of being favored with The Word His Son in the world and Holy Spirit from the One God the only true God.Tioliendo Anecdote The danger of promoting the focus on The Eye of Horus I had a friend who tattooed herself with this symbol. I never knew its danger and meaning as a way to Egyptian magic witchcraft evil or mythology. But when I asked my friend her religion she referred to Egyptian ancient religion. I had a sense of what it meant and I knew it wasnt good for her. She was a very beautiful woman but there was always a distance that revealed itself in the hint of a strained look on her beautiful face. I went on a date with her but somehow ended up at her familys house. I would later see her self-portrait nude and wondered at her showing herself even in art to the world like that when she was so distant usually. But then time past and we didnt see each other. Then I saw her again. She had withered and the voluptuous curvy figure was not the flat chested figure of a skinny body looking body. I had no doubt something connected to her religion practice had to do with this. I asked what happened and told her how much I loved her body artistically she knew what I meant. I like it she said of her new body. Years later I saw her and she had her beautiful body back had she given up the unholy powers that had such the beauty out of her was it that eye of Horus I wondered. Reply Andy Kistler says February 28 2016 at 951 am .... way too many reviewers focus on the ""white-washing"" issue. Which really just tells you that film reviewers 1) dont know very much about Ancient Egypt and 2) probably didnt really pay attention during the movie. To start with almost all of those actors were tanned/dark-skinned enough to be believable particularly when it came to Gods and royalty based on what archaeological evidence we have. Egypt was extremely heterogeneous lighter skin was common and from most of what we know it was not a largely Nubian population. And really the whole argument is moot since it clearly didnt actually take place on Earth or in Ancient Egypt. Reply Lazar says March 2 2016 at 655 am You do know that Africa is not inhabited only by Black people. North Africa is inhabited today by Arabic and Berber speaking bronze- light brown to dark brown skinned peoples and despite their modern language I bet modern Egyptians look exactly like ancient Egyptians which means they were bronze to dark browned skinned not black and most certainly not looking like Sub saharan peoples. I started reading Egyptian literature and they most certainly diferentiated themselves from the sub saharan peoples. If they were black themselves they would most certainly not differentiated themselves and they would not have specific words and even slurs for the black race. It is equaly racist to say Ancient Egyptians were African Blacks as it would be to say they were white. If this movie is racist as it is it would most certainly be even more racist if it included all Black African American cast perhaps even more offensive to Egyptians. African Americans and White Americans tend to transfer their simplistic racial view and division on the entire world even when it doesnt exist. For example black guy would lump me and guy from neighbouring Romania with white guy from America into the same cultural group as whites and me and Romanian guy as Europeans even though our groups are mostly unconnected and at least me and that Romanian guy would see the white American and African American guy as equaly foreign to us. Also to me personnaly African Americans are culturaly not in any way African anymore. Never have I seen African Americans take pride in the specific cultures their ancestors came from (For majority cultures of West Africa) instead having invented this imaginary pan- African identity which never existed in the first place. Also it speaks volumes about low education of certain political leaders that they started to see Islam as religion of their free ancestors which it most certainly wasnt. Islam not only does not forbid slavery but outright regulated it and Islamic Qalifate started the first mass enslavement of black people 1000 years before it took its full swing under whites. West African Muslim black kingdoms were main slave selling states and blacks also seem to forget that white slaves also existed at the same time their ancestors suffered. So instead for African Americans to be pissed at Western European colonial power whites they are pissed at all whites in the world. And so we now got non authentic view of African culture which actually never existed trying to be imposed by insecure black elites instead of being proud at authentic West African Heritage. Any true african is much prouder and with education much more progressive looking and confident in his identity than 99 percent of African Americans. Reply JN _ D says February 27 2016 at 1000 am Just a light film. If you dont think too hard about it. Actually was a good movie. Some of the comments are obsessive about ""white washing"". Its a movie not meant to be a documentary. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Reply James says February 27 2016 at 153 am I like the innovative story of this movie. It is pure fantasy with plenty of action (CGI amp; whats not). I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. We should view this show from the aspects of a different form of storytelling. The Review inaccurately amp; unfairly judged this movie from the usual aspect of life creation from the christians bible. Also I think the reviewer are not familiar with Epyptian mythology to brand this show as boring or absurb. If Greek gods are involved I believe the review would be very different indeed. So just watch the show with a pinch of salt amp; enjoy storytelling at a fantasy level. ""Pure Magic"". Reply Dylan Bickerstaffe says February 26 2016 at 1252 pm It would be vain to hope for historical accuracy - or at least plausibility - from such films but what such productions invariably lack is any atmosphere.

Reply Richard says February 25 2016 at 459 pm This was movie that I was sitting on the fence about but after having seen it was a silly bit of fantasy ...much like Sinbad or Clash of the Titans ...but it was tons of goofy fun with over the top ...sometimes cheesy but most of the time amazingly beautiful CGI eye candy. The cast dispite the casting choices ( which too be frank except for Gerards accent didnt bother me and this isnt an all white cast by any means ) is attractively game if sometimes ham fisted .

Not negroes. The negro fantasies began in the 60s. They were Ethiopians or east Africans. Ancient Egyptians are 90% genetically identical to modern Egyptians. End of story. Anon says February 25 2016 at 143 pm For some unknown reason I guess its because Egypt happens to be on the continent of Africa a large number of people just simply refuse to believe Egyptians are not black. There are Egyptians living in the U.S. You can see them for yourself or walk up and ask them. The award winning actor Rami Malek is American amp; Egyptian. Not black. They are not nor have they ever been black. Egypt like quite literally every other country in the world was visited for trade purposes and also invaded by other groups as they rose and fell from power; such as the Canaanites the Libyans the Nubians the Assyrians the Babylonians the Persians the Macedonian Greeks (Cleopatra was Greek) the Romans the Arabs the Turks and the British. Are all of these people likely mixed into the DNA of the ancient and modern day Egyptians yes of course. That just makes them Egyptians. Btw there are other north African countries in which the native people are not black Libya Algeria Morocco. Aside from Hollywood (for whom I cant speak) by speaking pure fact -- nobody is trying to take anything away from anyone. Theyre just reporting archaeological and anthropological scientific knowledge. That isnt ""whitewashing"" anything. Ed Keiling says February 25 2016 at 138 pm You couldnt be more wrong. Egypt was a multi ethnic society and the art reflects that unlike what you claim - that is if you ever been to a museum. Even the bust of Cleopatra in the Metropolitan Museum shows a mixed Greek with some black in her. Plus Nubians were not ""visitors"" to Egypt (what does that even mean?) but indeed ruled the place for over 100 years. (BBC has a documentary on that called "" The Black Pharaohs"" you could benefit from watching it.) According to their own writings Egypt was ruled by blacks whites mixed reds and also blue individuals. Most Egyptologists without an agenda (either pro Black or pro white) claim Egypt was very close to what Brazil is with people ranging from blondes to all shades of black and white in between. As for the movie its all over the place and looks kitsch (not in a good way). Mikey says February 25 2016 at 136 pm They were not caucasian they were East Africans similar to modern day Ethiopians Sudanese and Somoli people. They were only caucasian after the Roman Turkish and Arab conquests. I repeat THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS WERE NOT CAUCASSIAN KarlHeimer says February 25 2016 at 122 pm ""They were basically Caucasian"" LOL. Whitewashing history much? Marie says February 25 2016 at 1152 am This and London Has Fallen. Jesus Gerald what the heck are you doing? I saw Law Abiding Citizen. He got the chops just not picking the right movies. Reply Anon says February 25 2016 at 204 pm What is anyone talking about ""WERE""? Egyptians ARE. They live people. I have friends who are actual living Egyptians. Ooo. Imagine. And they arent black. Im sorry to tell everyone who was counting on them being black. They are not at all ""similar to Ethiopians"" who are generally darker skinned than Egyptians. The Nubians werent in Egypt until the very later dynasties and they were only in the ruling classes not mingling so much with the public in general. 100 years of Nubians in the scheme of thousands of years worth of Egyptian dynasties is really a drop in their historical and DNA bucket. The word ""VISITED"" in terms of an historical discussion generally refers to those who came as trade partners as opposed to those who came to conquer. Thats all. Nobodys trying to pull anything over on anyone. It means they visited frequently FOR MONEY. Something people have always liked to do. The Egyptians were very big on money at least 1% of them were (some things never change). To be honest I dont know what we should be calling Egyptians anthropologically speaking as they might be closer to being full Arabs. But I guess thats a question for an anthropologist. Reply irwinator1992 says February 25 2016 at 1151 am Can someone tell me why Geoff Shaevitz and Summit Entertainment are allowed to keep making movies ?? Between this film the Twilight saga and Divergent its safe to say that Summit is officially the laughingstock of Hollywood. Lionsgate made a fatal mistake in buying Summit which is a festering corpse with no quality pictures of any kind. I would not be surprised if the entire Lionsgate studio filed for Chapter 11 after Allegiant tanks. As for Alex Proyas the whitewashing was the least of his movies problems. The biggest problem is that he made a boring wooden and convoluted Street Fighter cutscene masquerading as a mythological flick. Dated special effects the casting of Gerard Butler and a script by the schmucks who did Dracula Untold didnt help. If this film is going hurt anyones career its certainly Proyas. He has completely sold out trading focus style and originally (The Crow Dark City) for messy big-bucks fireworks shows (I Robot Knowing). His career will never recover. There is a film called ""Only Yesterday"". And it is a masterpiece that makes you laugh cry think (and it makes you care about movies as an art form). In fact any film starring Daisy Ridley is a masterpiece. See ""Only Yesterday"" instead of ""Gods Of Egypt"". Reply Rex says February 25 2016 at 731 pm Heres your answer China. This movie may bomb theatrically in North America but it will play in China because it has Asian actors in the cast. Not many but enough to make me suspect it probably has SOME Chinese money behind it. Granted it wont make a mint there either but China and other recently-westernizing countries LOVE sparkly Hollywood movies that some of their own actors can be shoehorned into just like this one. And thats why theyll keep cranking them out. In a sense theyre no different than the Italian peplum movies of the 50s and 60s large-scaled expensive-looking (albeit cheaply produced in those days) and over-plotted casts-of-thousands spectacles that traveled easily across cultures. The reviews of this one especially Changs have me itching to see it on the big screen since the opportunity will be short lived from the sounds of it. I do however wish peoplewould stop dumping on 3D. It rarely makes movies look ""murky"" and it ONLY does so when projectionists dont turn UP their projector beams like theyre supposed to. Instead their laziness means we 3D patrons (who still attend in massive numbers) have to suffer with 3D movies projected at light levels appropriate for 2D only. The proof is in the subsequent 3D Blu-Ray editions that invariably present the films the way theyre supposed to be see. Reply Andy Dursin (theaisleseatcom) says February 25 2016 at 1154 am What an odd comment. TWILIGHT made scores of money. Divergent not as much but still plenty. This movie wont. Why would you consider them all in the same breath? Reply irwinator1992 says February 25 2016 at 1223 pm What I was trying to say is those three movies are complete junk. In fact they are not movies just products. Bill B. says February 25 2016 at 1144 am Who on earth thought this would be a hit? I only wonder where it will fail most. Financially or critically. From what I have read so far its a tie. Reply Denise Cowles-Lewis says February 25 2016 at 1133 am Dang tell us how you really feel. The trailers have some beautiful work in them.....sounds like it is the entire best parts of the film Still want to see it though. Reply Maire says February 25 2016 at 1150 am ""The trailers have some beautiful work in them"" The CGI looks awful. Reply Jim says February 25 2016 at 1150 am Denise the reviewer was far kinder than necessary. The film is utter garbage. Reply Jpe says February 25 2016 at 1215 pm So yoube seen it? L.A. Julian says February 25 2016 at 1123 am An Egyptian-mythology-based movie made with complete disregard for the actual tragic-epic love triangle of the Osiran myth cycle and replacing that goddess-centric revenge story with something completely unrelated? What could possibly go wrong? Reply Richard says February 25 2016 at 448 pm Did you actually see it because from what I read except for the inclusion of mortals so we could relate to the story and simplifying an cutting down the pantheon of gods it sticks pretty close to the various versions of the story and themes. Reply Kenmandu says February 25 2016 at 1054 am If those abs could only act. Reply Anon says February 25 2016 at 209 pm What the heck happened to Gerard Butler? I dont know if anyone can actually answer that so Im not sure if thats a serious question. He did at one time know how to make it seem as if he could act. I saw DEAR FRANKIE. It was a really nicely made film. He was good in it too. Its easily been 8 yrs or more since hes done anything thats remotely resembled acting. I guess hes made money. Hope hes happy.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint I thought gods were supposed to be divine. Overstocked overstuffed and overlong ""Gods of Egypt"" packs a squadron of immediately forgettable mythological deities into 127 inefficient minutes. A dubious venture to begin with it quickly collapses into an orgy of 3-D Transformers-style combat between clanging metallic beasts and slapdash comic dialogue that mistakes wisecracks for narrative. A franchise this is not. The plot has something to do with a family squabble among the prehistoric lords of old over who will inherit dominion over ancient Egypt. Because they dont wear their standard animal heads they resemble the human worshipers most of them live among. Because the gods are much taller than regular mortals the little ones think they are totally cool much like NBA fans. The totally rad coronation day party for the soon to be crowned King Horus (""Game of Thrones"" star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) goes badly when his eyes are ripped out by his uncle Set (Gerard Butler reprising his yelly shouty scenery-fanging work from ""300""). The endless blitzkrieg that follows between the duo and their various factions wherein all become gargantuan tinny creatures with wings or dog faces indulges all of studio fantasy films worst copycat intentions. Light sabers -- check. City-smashing wrestling matches -- sure why not? A romantic subplot between vapid lovebirds -- monkey see monkey do. There are also moments of appealing originality. As Thoth the lord of wisdom Chadwick Boseman brings a light audience-tickling tone of comic vanity especially when he spends a minute trying to describe intellectually the unique properties of lettuce. Regrettably director Alex Proyas the ambitious creator of ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"" spends most of his time and ours focusing on pseudo-epic scenes that feel like leftovers from a medium-budget anime. GODS OF EGYPT 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for fantasy violence and action and some sexuality. Somehow two august stars of yesteryear were persuaded to join this unmitigated mess. Their names will be withheld to protect the innocent. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

But it feels like one long video game. (Lionsgate) BY Stephen Whitty NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 25 2016 746 AM Title Gods of Egypt Film Info With Gerard Butler Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Brenton Thwaites Geoffrey Rush. Stalk like an Egyptian as ancient gods swear vengeance. Director Alex Proyas. (207). PG-13 Violence sensuality alcohol abuse. Area theaters. I want my mummy. Unfortunately Boris Karloff Lon Chaney Jr. and the rest of Hollywoods lovable old gauzers do not show up in ""Gods of Egypt."" Instead we get strutting giants colliding egos and endless time-wasting. The movies idea -- and it has only one -- is that in ancient Egypt deities once walked among the mortals. They were 12-feet tall and they bled molten gold but other than that they were just like us. In other words jealous vengeful drunken. So when the great god Osiris decides to bestow his crown upon his beloved son Horus Horus peevish Uncle Set shows up. He thinks the throne should go to him. He kills the king and queen and plucks out Horus eyes. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS ENTERTAINMENT ON FACEBOOK | ON TWITTER Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is Horus in ""Gods of Egypt."" (Lisa Tomasetti/Lionsgate) Then he banishes Horus and seizes the throne. And immediately condemns his new flesh-and-blood subjects to a life of building pyramids just to satisfy his sick edifice complex. Worst party guest. Ever. DAILY DIG WERE DOOMED HOLLYWOODS APOCALYPSE OBSESSION There is however Bek a plucky human thief who if this were 1954 would probably be Tony Curtis. Unfortunately now its Brenton Thwaites a wispy blond with all the charisma of a papyrus scroll. Beks beloved has been murdered by one of the evil gods minions. And so he joins forces with the disabled Horus to defeat death overthrow the vile Set and somehow keep us interested. Gerard Butler plays the usurper Set. (Lionsgate) Guess which one of these miraculous feats they dont pull off? The movie has a certain amount of camp going for it. Hard not to when you have Geoffrey Rush bulging his eyes and throwing spears of fire as Ra or Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau matching swords and scandals as Set and Horus. Oh and yes this is another OsirisSoWhite version of history in which ancient Egypt is mostly populated by Anglo-Saxons. The only dark-skinned god is a prancing poser who seems to be auditioning for ""RuPauls Drag Race."" At least hes livelier than the rest of the cast. But its not easy to act naturally when youre surrounded by the most excessive yet unimpressive special effects in years. Director Alex Proyas movie feels like a bad video game. Still like its towering gods the movies already left a big footprint with ads plastered up everywhere pushing its spectacle its magic its 3D. Clearly its studio hopes for a huge hit -- with early audiences bringing in new fans and them bringing in still more fans. There are even hopes of a franchise. Talk about a pyramid scheme.
