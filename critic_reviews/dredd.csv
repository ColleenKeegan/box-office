A sprawling metropolis known as Mega City One stretches from Boston to Washington D.C. This territory houses 800 million people in bleak towering buildings that look more like badly designed shopping malls than vertiginous slums. While theres no sign of nature or greenery in this gray irradiated world the inhabitants behavior seems to be starkly black or white. Crime and homelessness are rampant with only leather-clad super-cops known as ""judges"" on hand to hold chaos at bay. They are sheriff judge jury and executioner all in one racing around on stylized motorcycles enforcing the law and laying waste to criminals.TRAILER Dredd 3DVIDEO Urban brings Dredd back to the big screen Joe Dredd (Karl Urban) is meant to be the most fearsome judgea??but we dont get to see many more of his kind around. In fact we dont get to see much of him. Thanks to an elaborate helmet only his mouth and a small part of his nose are visible. Like Tom Hardys Bane in The Dark Knight Rises its debatable if his role can actually be considered a full performancea??given that the majority of his face is obscured and his voice garbled to a gruff whispery baritone. Call it an evocative scowl.In this installment Dredd is saddled with breaking in a rookie named Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) who possesses special psychic powers that make her highly useful to the judicial force.On their first assignment together Dredd and Anderson investigate a crime-infested slum and are quickly terrorized by a prostitute-turned-callous druglord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) and her band of nasty thugs and druggies. All sorts of mayhem hurtling bodies and blood-spurting gore ensue. This sequel features a deadly drug called Slow-Mo which gives the illusion of slowing time to a fraction of its actual speed. The special effects used to capture how the drug works on its users are the movies best scenes though the 3D element serves mostly to heighten sprays and pools of blood in an ultra-vivid in-your-face crimson. And speaking of faces Dredd shoots a villain or two in the mouth with a special bullet that capitalizes on the extra dimensionality.Ma-Ma devotes most of her time to grimacing and ordering people to do her dirty work. She finds a flunky to lockdown the skyscraper slum she controls and sends her minions out to slay Dredd and Anderson. Its a hoot to hear the imposing Dredd make threatening remarks addressed to what sounds like ""Mama."" And after a particularly grisly massacre a loudspeaker that announces ""Level One food court will re-open in 30 minutes"" is humorously incongruous.While not for the squeamish Dredd 3D is an effectively gritty B movie accentuated by stylish visuals and irreverent humor.

The opening credits end and the movie begins with a huge wide computer-generated image of a blasted landscape studded only with enormous gray apartment towers. ""America is an irradiated wasteland ..."" a narrator raspily begins. And here we go again. ""Mad Max"" was a fine movie in its time but its time was more than 30 years ago and since then weve had so many post-apocalyptic action films theyve all begun to blur into a single dystopia. Decaying slums all-powerful policemen the stray mutant or two -- yeah whatever. Do we really need another installment in this? Of course in a way this film ""Dredd"" isnt so much a new chapter as an original text. The title character was introduced in a British comic back in the late 70s; the central idea (implacable lawman tries to keep order in midst of urban anarchy) made later films possible. Its not the fault of ""Dredd"" if it feels old. It is its fault however that its not very good. Our narrator and hero of a sort is played by Karl Urban (and youll have to trust me on that -- he never takes off his face-obscuring helmet). As the film begins hes been assigned a rookie -- who just happens to be a psychic by the way -- for a training day. Which turns into a trial by rapid-fire when they respond to a triple homicide in one of the citys gigantic apartment blocks and find themselves locked in and under attack from a stupendously armed gang. It plays a little like the recent Indonesian film ""The Raid Redemption"" just slowed down and with more guns -- which is probably enough for the least demanding action fans. Its very loud and things -- and people -- explode regularly. Smarter diehard ""Dredd"" fans will be pleased too that the script doesnt try to ""improve"" on the character as the awful 1995 Sylvester Stallone film did. Instead it keeps to the grim and gritty basics as the emotionless Dredd coldly kills one guilty perp after another. Perhaps thats the problem. Because really whats here to draw us in? The same old damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-dont politics (which suggests the only choice is between criminal anarchy or fascist vigilantism)? The same old look of crumbling Stalinist architecture and shiny Nazi leather? A character whos somehow even less human than Robocop? Olivia Thirlby adds some humanity as the empath if not much logic (if she were a better mind reader she wouldnt get into all the trouble she does). And as the scarred queen of a drug cartel Lena Headey chews the scenery and some of her costars with relish. There are also some beautiful effects thanks to that drug. Dubbed ""Slo-Mo"" it turns reality into a glittery barely breathing daydream and provides this gray and ugly film with its few moments of magic and color. But other than that theres nothing new here. We have seen this future. And not only does it not work -- it no longer even surprises. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence gore strong language drug use and sexual situations. Dredd 3D (R) Lionsgate (96 min.) Directed by Pete Travis. With Karl Urban Olivia Thirlby. Now playing in New Jersey.

Special to Newsday + - This film image released by Lionsgate shows Karl Urban in a scene from ""Dredd 3D."" Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A combination cop-judge-jury-executioner and his rookie partner battle a drug lord in a dystopian future. BOTTOM LINE Ultraviolent British satirical comic is played straight and unimaginatively. CAST Karl Urban Olivia Thirlby Lena Headey Wood Harris LENGTH 136 Surpassing the low bar of being better than 1995s soullessly glossy ""Judge Dredd"" starring Sylvester Stallone this second adaptation of the long-running British comic-book feature is instead soullessly gritty. Set in a science-fiction dystopia of a grossly overcrowded future with anachronistically 2012-looking cars and minivans ""Dredd"" proves a surprisingly unimaginative cops vs. drug lord story complete with the weathered veteran forced to take a rookie under his wing. That veteran is Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) one of a corps of police officer-judge-jury-executioners in Mega-City One a walled metropolis of 800 million stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. No sooner is he assigned newbie Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) -- a washout the brass nonetheless wants to field-test since shes a powerful mutant psychic -- than the two are called to the 200-story vertical slum Peach Trees where three men have been thrown to their deaths. Investigating they arrest Kay (Wood Harris) a suspect in the murders. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Kay however is a lieutenant of a sociopathic drug kingpin or perhaps ""queenpin"" Madeline Madrigal aka Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) whose narcotic Slo-Mo markedly slows a users perception of time. Not wanting Kay to crack under questioning she has her computer expert (Domhnall Gleeson) close the blast doors that protect the building in case of war. With the judges and their captive trapped in the maze guns are soon blazing and perps and bystanders killed by the dozens along with story logic and plot sense. At least the films technical aspects including its 3-D are sterling. The films one believably human scene involves Anderson meeting the family of a murderous gang member shes killed. Otherwise its all tough-guy talk and humorless cynicism -- which is odd since the comics feature running since 1977 in the weekly anthology ""2000 AD"" is largely a satire of this kind of story with deliberately over-the-top attitudes that anticipated the satirical violence and societal corporatization of ""RoboCop"" (1987). This by-the-numbers movie however seems the product of RoboFilmmakers. PLOT A combination cop-judge-jury-executioner and his rookie partner battle a drug lord in a dystopian future.

The Sylvester Stallone fascist police-state movies were bad enough the first time. Do they really think theyre fooling us by calling the remake ""Dredd"" instead of ""Judge Dredd""? Whats next ""Cobra 2.0""? ""Dredd"" this time starring Karl Urbans mouth instead of Stallones begins in a scary future where in a single neighborhood you can come across 96 percent unemployment. That part I can believe -- I work in the newspaper industry -- but I wondered whether the judicial policemen of the future quite have the right idea in dealing with all of this misery by shooting everyone in sight. Dredd is a judge jury and executioner who operates under the aegis of a vaguely Third Reich-ish eagle with a visor concealing most of his face. Justice is supposed to be blind but in this case I think what the Law really wants is unaccountability. Maybe this movie will be a big hit at police conventions. We are asked to believe Dredd and Co. are all that stands between us and chaos but the chief crime of the evildoers seems principally to be that they like to smoke a drug called ""slo-mo"" that makes time pass at 1 percent of its actual speed (or four times as fast as this thudding repetitive movie). In the opening Dredd pursues a van containing three miscreants who in trying to escape him accidentally kill a pedestrian which according to Dredd bumps their status up from ""wanted men"" to ""should be shot on sight."" Manslaughter equals instant death sentence? Never mind. When in doubt use excessive force. Dredds partner for the day is a blond psychic named Anderson (indie-chick Olivia Thirlby -- sellout) who tags along for an evaluation that will determine whether she too can earn the right to shoot anyone she pleases. Anderson cant wear a helmet -- it interferes with her psychic powers she explains though viewers may notice that a helmet might interfere even more with her movie-star powers. For an hour or so of screen time the two partners blast their way through a vertical slum that is dominated by the drug gang the Ma-Ma clan named for its boss (Lena Headey) a scar-faced ex-prostitute. The super-slow motion deployed by director Pete Travis to illustrate the effects of the drug is the sole interesting feature of the movie. Taking a bath Ma-Ma luxuriates in every drop and when punishing her enemies she first gives them a hit of the drug (with an asthma inhaler) then tosses them out of the building for extra terror value. To us though falling slowly looks beautifully vivid and serene. The rest is relatively straightforward. My notes are as follows ""Shoot bad guy."" ""Shoot bad guy."" ""Shoot bad guy."" Theres a climactic confrontation with Ma-Ma that isnt very climactic and some corrupt judges work against our heroes but its hard to care which faceless authoritarian maniac shoots which faceless authoritarian maniac. All I wanted to do was escape from this aggressively ugly world and its equally unattractive characters. Its not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyperviolence adds up to nothing This thing is dedd.

Starring Lena Headey Domhnall Gleeson Karl Urban Olivia Thirlby Deobia Oparei Langley Kirkwood Jason Cope Kevon Kane Rakie Ayola Joe Vaz Director Pete Travis Running time 136 Release Opened Sep 21 2012  Editorial Review A thriller for fans to judgeBy Sean OConnellFriday September 21 2012Good news Judge Dredd fans. Pete Traviss savage interpretation of John Wagners futuristic law enforcer adheres to the characters grim graphic-novel roots and proves far superior to the corny misfire attempted by Sylvester Stallone back in 1995. This finally is the Dredd movie comic book readers have been anticipating. Dreadful news Dredd fans. If you also caught Gareth Evanss like-minded Indonesian thriller ""The Raid Redemption"" earlier this year then ""Dredd 3D"" will strike you as derivative. Through no fault of Travis and his crew the two movies follow near-identical blueprints (even though each filmed around the same time in separate locations). ""The Raid"" simply beat ""Dredd"" to theaters stealing a bit of its thunder. Theyre so similar in fact that Sony and Screen Gems could pull the plug on the American ""Raid remake they currently have in the works because it already exists and is opening under the name ""Dredd 3D."" Solemn Karl Urban (Bones in J.J. Abramss ""Star Trek"" reboot) dons the trademark helmet and motorcycle boots of Dredd a ruthless judge presiding over the decaying post-apocalyptic metropolis of Mega-City One. Two events complicate Dredds unremitting mission to clean up his streets. First hes saddled with a rookie partner (Olivia Thirlby) whos bound to slow him down. Second the duo is assigned to investigate an incident at Peach Trees a towering apartment complex run by crazed drug dealer Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). Ma-Ma manufactures and peddles SLO-MO an illegal substance that does exactly what youd imagine to an abusers brain. The drugs chemical effect prompts Travis to employ slow-motion visual technology and exhilarating bullet-time effects in his multiple action sequences which kick into graphic high gear once Dredd starts mowing down the opposition. And heres where the comparisons to ""The Raid"" become unavoidable. After Travis establishes Dredd as a take-no-prisoners law enforcer the movies goal is to have our hero march from the ground floor of Peach Trees to Ma-Mas penthouse eliminating waves of well-armed criminals in the process. Unlike ""The Raid"" which dispensed of its antagonists through gracefully choreographed combat dances ""Dredd 3D"" opts for satisfyingly bone-crunching brutality. Have you ever wondered what a bullet looks like as it travels through facial flesh? Because ""Dredd"" is going to show you. Theres plenty for genre fans to appreciate in ""Dredd."" Its faithful to the British comic which artist Carlos Ezquerra illustrated with an unnerving blend of grit blood and sleaze. Headey is ridiculously good as the deranged Ma-Ma playing the material so seriously that ""Dredd"" avoids the camp that swallowed Stallones take on the material. Thirlbys a vast improvement over Rob Schneider from Stallones ""Judge Dredd."" And Urban leaves Dredds mask on the entire time which die-hard fans of the character will tell you is a must. ""Dredd 3D"" is malicious gory masochistic and uncompromising. But it caters to its base like a presidential candidate on the campaign trail. Expect countless ""Dredd"" fans to vote at the box office with their ticket sales. Contains strong bloody violence drug use lagnuage and some sexual content.

"Dredd 3D has the cast and the look but not the feel Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Dredd 3D has the cast and the look but not the feelThe action film stars Karl Urban Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey all talented and has fine cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle. But it misfires.September 21 2012|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd in ""Dredd 3D."" (Joe Alblas Lionsgate )Smartly cast and with a sharp team behind the scenes there is no good reason why ""Dredd 3D"" is such a clunk-headed action picture.In the future a single urban core sprawls from Boston to D.C. patrolled by officers who function as a self-contained legal system a judge jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) and a training-day rookie (Olivia Thirlby) become trapped within a crime-ridden high-rise and are forced to fight their way up and out.Screenwriter and producer Alex Garland previously has taken on dystopian sci-fi in ""28 Days Later"" ""Sunshine"" and ""Never Let Me Go"" injecting each with a beating heart that is sorely lacking in this latest comic-book adaptation.Directed by Pete Travis ""Dredd 3D"" becomes burdened by the same structural dilemma as the recent ""The Raid Redemption"" a once the cops are locked into fighting their way out of the building the film simply becomes a monotonous series of bad-guy confrontations.Urban is stuck throughout the entire film acting from beneath a helmet with only his jaw and mouth visible; his eyes are hidden beneath a dark visor. Thirlby an actress of transparent vulnerability thankfully doesnt wear a helmet because it would interfere with her characters psychic abilities but that also burdens her with the entire emotional weight of the film.Lena Headey brings a perverse mixture of glee and regret to her drug-lord villainess.The drug she sells is called ""Slo-Mo"" which allows cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle a key conceiver of contemporary digital aesthetics working here in 3-D for the first time a chance for dazzling effects and an opportunity to shift the films dank color palette to something brightly irradiated.That ""Dredds"" cinematography is one of its strongest assets speaks to the films larger problems a the parts and pieces just dont have the total impact they should like a punch sailing helplessly through the air rather than forcefully smacking its target.calendarlatimes.com--Dredd 3DMPAA ratingA R for strong bloody violence drug use and some sexual contentRunning timeA 1 hour 38 minutesPlayingA In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESToronto 2012 Dredd storms the building at Midnight...September 7 2012Fall Sneaks listSeptember 2 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowFilmNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-dredd-3d-20120921,0,3925203.story",200,dredd5,dredd,latimes

Because this motorcycle cop dispenses justice with a strong degree of finality. More about Dredd 3D >> Based on the British comic-book character Judge Dredd is a tough man in a bleak future - policing 800 million souls jammed into a crime-saturated urban jungle that extends from Boston to Washington. In Dredd 3D Dredd is played with grim conviction by Karl Urban (The Bourne Supremacy). At least the credits maintain that its Urban. Since he wears a helmet with tinted visor in every scene you never see his face. Dredd doesnt have a broad emotional palette - he sees the world in black and red. But Urban must do all his acting with his lips which for most of the film are turned down in revulsion so that he resembles a cutthroat trout. And all his lines are delivered in a scratchy monotone. This may be the best 2-D performance in a 3-D film to date. In this ultraviolent outing - still a considerable upgrade over Sylvester Stallones goofy Judge Dredd in 1995 - Urban is teamed with a probationary rookie (Olivia Thirlby) who has psychic powers. At least she has them when theyre convenient for the plot. She gets a baptism by firepower when Dredd takes her into a skyscraper slum ruled over by the evil Ma-Ma (Game of Thrones Lena Headey). With her ugly facial scar and feral manner Ma-Ma is like the worlds scariest alley cat. The movie consists of one long battle as Dredd tries to shut down the manufacture of Ma-Mas addictive new drug Slo-Mo. (Although why anyone in this hellhole would want time to move slower is beyond me.) There isnt much plot or scenery or even cast for that matter. But Dredd 3D plays far bigger than it should. For sci-fi action fans its an instant classic. For everyone else its a dark bloody mess. Contact David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com or follow on Twitter daveondemand_tv.

Joe Alblas/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Joe Alblas/Lionsgate Dredd Director Pete Travis Genres Action Sci-Fi Running Time 98 minutes Rated R for strong bloody violence language drug use and some sexual content With Karl Urban Olivia Thirlby Lena Headey (Recommended) The prestige film festivals were abuzz this month with independent films and possible awards contenders but for movies opening wide September is traditionally a dump month -- a fallow time between the summer and Oscar season when studios release films expected to underperform. There are always exceptions to the rule but given its vital stats you wouldnt be faulted for casting a wary eye at Dredd a 3-D actioner set in a ruined urban dystopia and arguably better suited to a summer release. Add to the red flags that this film is actually the second attempt at adapting the long-running British comic about a law-enforcement officer with the power of judge jury and executioner -- 1995s Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone was a critical and financial disappointment -- and the smart money would say avoid this iteration. Forget the timing and forget the overstuffed schlocktastic Stallone movie. (Unless youd like to relive some truly spectacular line readings.) Not only is Dredd a smart bit of September counterprogramming its a gleefully audacious visceral near-perfect action movie. In Mega-City One a vast and decaying metropolis stretching from Boston to D.C. Dredd (Karl Urban the Bones McCoy in the latest Star Trek film) patrols the streets as a member of the Judges a corps of individuals equally expert in combat and the law. As the last remaining political authority of a megalopolis in chaos the Judges arrest sentence and even execute criminals on the spot with a grim and practiced efficiency. Dredd represents the paragon of that system workmanlike in his relentless pursuit of justice and as unbending as the law he enforces. In an especially bloody opening that feels all too routine Dredd pursues and dispatches a murderous criminal who at the last minute takes a civilian hostage. ""Negotiations over"" Dredd growls before applying a creative solution to the problem. Stylized violence abounds that would seem a better fit for a B-movie were each act of brutality not rendered with horrifying and at times visually stunning specificity thats only enhanced by 3-D. i Judge Dredd and his protege Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) fight a drug lord in a post-apocalyptic slum. Joe Alblas/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Joe Alblas/Lionsgate Judge Dredd and his protege Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) fight a drug lord in a post-apocalyptic slum. Joe Alblas/Lionsgate Watching an unstoppable force kick ass and deliver surprisingly effective one-liners would make for a rousing if ultimately limited experience; wisely the film ups the stakes by pairing its merciless and impenetrable protagonist with an earnest rookie in need of evaluation. Dredds superior asks him to ignore that Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) trained but untested in the field didnt quite pass the necessary tests to become a Judge -- the radiation on the citys outskirts has mutated her though fortunately the result was valuable psychic powers rather than a third or fourth arm. Writer Alex Garland who penned the sci-fi thriller 28 Days Later and the more personal Never Let Me Go resists the impulse to overload on fan-service mythology instead presenting Dredds complex and potentially overwhelming source material through the sharp lens of a day-in-the-life story. Dredd and Anderson respond to a triple homicide at Peach Trees one of the citys massive housing complexes where they pick up the trail of a new drug called Slo-Mo which makes users feel as if time is passing at a tiny fraction of its normal rate. When Peach Trees ruthless gang boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) discovers them snooping around her block she shuts down the building and invites its 75000 inhabitants to kill the Judges if they want to go outside again. Dredd doesnt blink at a death sentence -- or if he does the formidable helmet covering half his face doesnt show it. (The hat makes for some impressive nose-down acting from Urban.) He keeps calm angry and carries on a superhero upholding societys status quo without a society left to save. That the world is crumbling around him makes little difference to Dredd -- he enforces the law and continues to drill Anderson as they try to fight their way out. Ma-Mas thugs constantly challenge the Judges making their dangerous situation increasingly more desperate and director Pete Travis takes full advantage of the claustrophobic halls of the tenement staging muscular and kinetic action sequences that eschew post-production computer effects. Scenes involving Slo-Mo especially are dazzlingly realized in 3-D by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle; while extreme in its violence Dredd even portrays blood spatter with graceful lyricism. While Dredd himself is mostly a conundrum Urban brings nuance to the character infusing him with a bestial but purposeful physicality and giving him a harsh voice that would beat Batmans to a pulp. As Anderson Thirlby grounds the film emotionally; the stakes for her are higher than just her own life as she experiences for the first time the realities and costs of the job. Theres a cynical way to look at Dredd if its successful proof for Hollywood that eventually any property can be made to work. But that would miss the point entirely. Dredd works because its an action flick with wide appeal that takes risks it doesnt need to -- in its delightfully off-putting violence and daring style -- and those choices pay off in a singular and exhilarating movie experience. Its savage beautiful and loads of fun.

Lionsgate By Joe Morgenstern Sept. 20 2012 501 p.m. ET ""Dredd 3D"" is the iPhone of recent action thrillers. The movie doesnt do apps or for that matter drop calls but this particularly violent thriller is distinguished by elegant design. Whats familiar about the film is the grunge concatenation of firepower body count and gross-out abuse of all-too-tender flesh. Whats exceptional is the orchestration of color form light and dark (lots of dark) 3-D technology and digital effects into a look that amounts to a vision. The director was Pete Travis working from a shrewd terse screenplay by Alex Garland; the production designer was Mark Digby and the cinematographer was Anthony Dod Mantle. (The latter two collaborated similarly on ""Slumdog Millionaire."") The opening shot is a variation on the theme of ""WALLE""--a slow flyby over a vast garbage dump of a megalopolis in a blighted future except that this sprawl Mega City One is fully inhabited. The city is a battleground between free-range criminals and so-called Judges the Robocop-ish descendants of Rambo who function as judges juries and executioners not to mention noisemakers what with their flatulent motorcycles and end-of-days weaponry. Chief among them is yes you guessed it Judge Dredd who was played by a glum Sylvester Stallone in the fairly dreadful 1995 film ""Judge Dredd"" and who is played this time around by Karl Urban. Played is a big word for what the helmeted actor is able to do with his husky voice slyly laconic dialogue and the visible parts of his face i.e. his scowl and stubble. Dredds partner an anxious rookie named Cassandra doesnt wear a helmet since it would scramble her psychic powers so she is played visibly as well as audibly by Olivia Thirlby who succeeds in investing an action figure with affecting fear impressive courage and a commitment to justice that serves as Cassandras compass. The story has been assembled from repurposed genre elements a vertical ghetto 200 stories high controlled by a scar-faced prostitute turned drug lord--or drug lady--named Ma-Ma; shes played to a lurid fare-thee-well by Lena Headey. And Ma-Mas product comes out of a shop that looks a lot like an industrial-scale meth lab. But its the nature of the drug that dictates much of the productions visual distinction. The compound in question Slo-Mo makes its addicts feel as if time is passing at 1% of its normal speed. The effects of Slo-Mo are visualized by super-slo-mo cinematography in sequences of dreamy sumptuousness iridescent soap bubbles afloat over Ma-Mas bathtub (and thanks to the 3-D over the first few rows of theater seats); bodies falling ever so slo-moly onto public spaces; one body drifting down an elevator shaft in the company of glass shards that flutter and swirl like clouds of what used to be called in a more innocent time Disney Dust. Occasionally ""Dredd 3D"" bogs down in passages that arent supposed to be slow; the movie will almost stop every now and then to admire its own physical beauty. And theres no way of elevating those exploding heads and sliced-off limbs into dramatic art. All the same the juxtaposition of brutality and improbable chivalry in a dystopia built on the foundations of ""Blade Runner"" ""Brazil"" and even ""Naked City"" is a vision thats hard to dismiss. Watch a clip from the documentary ""How to Survive a Plague"" the story of two coalitions ACT UP and TAG (Treatment Action Group) whose activism turned AIDS from a death sentence into a manageable condition. (Video Sundance Selects) How to Survive a Plague If you watched ""How to Survive a Plague"" with the sound turned off you would readily see it as a history of the struggle to make a city and then a nation aware of AIDS that disease of fearful virulence for which there was no treatment when it first emerged in this country in the early 1980s. The archival footage most of it shot by the participants tells the tale vividly demonstrations in New York confrontations in Washington acts of civil disobedience street theater performed by activists determined to accelerate the laggardly pace of research by the government and the pharmaceutical industry. Thats a stirring tale but an incomplete one. Turn up the sound tune in to the passionate voices in David Frances brilliant documentary and you learn how some members of the activist group Act Up--members who in many cases were HIV positive--became instrumental in developing and testing the protease inhibitors that have finally proved equal to the plague. They did so out of desperation of course feeling themselves doomed to the fate that was decimating the gay community. Whats so remarkable about their decadeslong campaign though is how desperation led to inspiration--to the inspired notion that they as nonscientists could still take their fate in their own hands. By applying sufficient logic and mastering sufficient science--by wielding brain power as well as street power as one man puts it--they were able to join forces with Big Pharma FDA officials and National Institutes of Health doctors not only in focusing on promising drugs but in designing drug trials that were both responsible and expeditious. Susan Ellenberg a former chief biostatistician at the NIHs division of AIDS recalls being excited and impressed by Act Ups strategy. ""They were not against drug trials"" she tells Mr. Frances camera. ""They wanted to get the right answers but they wanted humane trials."" A similar tribute comes from Dr. Anthony Fauci then as now the NIHs director of AIDS research ""They elevated themselves with their self-education."" And one of the leaders of Act Ups campaign Peter Staley closes the film with a stirring postscript ""The way we did it the way we took care of ourselves and each other...is just mind-boggling. Just incredible."" Its an upbeat ending subject to a stark reservation. Millions of people around the world are still dying of AIDS every year an end-title card notes because they cant afford the drugs that could keep them alive. Watch a clip from the film ""End of Watch."" Two young officers (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena) are marked for death after confiscating a small cache of money and firearms from the members of a notorious cartel during a routine traffic stop. End of Watch David Ayers ""End of Watch"" derives huge energy most of it false from Roman Vasyanovs cinematography as well as from genuinely impressive performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena. Its not too much to say that like ""Dredd 3D"" this pounding saga of street-cop partners in Los Angeles is often about cinematography since everyone is either shooting video--Mr. Gyllenhaals Officer Brian Taylor is a would-be filmmaker--or being shot (by dashboard cameras hidden cameras and surveillance cameras) not to mention being shot at by a bloodthirsty succession of really really bad guys and girls who are involved with the closest thing to al Qaeda that the movies can come up with on domestic soil the Sinaloa cartel. Shallow down inside ""End of Watch"" is a music-video Frappuccino of quick cuts sparkling banter serial crises grisly violence and tongue-jerk profanity. (The fg quotient is astronomical. So is the producer quotient; 16 of them listed in the credits.) But the film is exciting in its manipulative way and exhausting and occasionally relieved by the humanity of Brians love for Janet a bright lively woman played by the always appealing Anna Kendrick. Whats more its a great recruiting tool for the LAPD. Unencumbered by nuance these cops are as pure as they are brave. Watch a clip from the film ""Trouble with the Curve."" An ailing baseball scout (Clint Eastwood) takes his daughter (Amy Adams) along for one last recruiting trip. Also starring John Goodman Justin Timberlake and Robert Patrick. (Video Warner Bros.) ENLARGE Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in Trouble With the Curve. Warner Bros. Pictures Trouble With the Curve This antediluvian baseball drama stars Clint Eastwood as a washed-up scout Gus and Amy Adams as Mickey the daughter who reluctantly teams up with him. The director was Robert Lorenz who has worked with Mr. Eastwood since the mid-1990s as a producer an assistant director or both. Its his debut feature and bush league almost all the way a lifeless rendering of an amateurish script (by Randy Brown) that covers some of the same ground as ""Moneyball""--old-fashioned intuition versus newfangled number-crunching--but covers it from some time warp where audiences still enjoy declamatory acting mawkish sentiments and wheezy editing. The movies most glaring problem is Mr. Eastwoods decision to play not very well pretty much the same character he portrayed most recently in ""Gran Torino""--an old geezer who has an enlarged prostate macular degeneration and a misanthropic demeanor thats supposed to be lovable except that it isnt; Gus is mostly a tiresome grump. Ms. Adams does her endearing best to lighten things up. Along with Mickeys touching efforts at reconciliation with her father she has some enjoyable encounters with Justin Timberlakes Johnny a charming ex-pitcher whos trying to reinvent himself as a play-by-play announcer. ""Trouble With the Curve"" finally finds its zone when Gus and Mickey find the young baseball prodigy theyve been looking for. That doesnt happen until the narratives last inning though too late to save the movie. Id call it ""Neanderthalball."" ENLARGE DVD Focus Zabriskie Point (1970) The Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni used slow-motion cinematography as it had never been used before to evoke a vision of America and its consumer goods blowing up in a spectacular apocalypse. At this late date thats the only reason to watch the film an ignominious lapse by a cinema master that deplores all things American except for our nations supposedly innocent youth. (The fatuous iconography came out of the 1960s reinforced by European condescension.) The young hero Mark (Mark Frechette) and young heroine Daria (Daria Halprin) meet in Death Valley where the heat is searing and the dialogue is dead. Milk (2008) Gus Van Sants film with Sean Penn as Harvey Milk opens on the gay activist and San Francisco supervisor dictating into a tape recorder. The year is 1978 and the words are taken from a tape full of foreboding that Milk dictated shortly before he and the citys mayor George Moscone were shot to death by a former supervisor Dan White. Mr. Penn won an Oscar for his performance; so did Dustin Lance Black for his screenplay. Milks life had previously been celebrated in Rob Epsteins 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" which won the Oscar it deserved. The Good Girl (2002) Jake Gyllenhaal is an amorous adolescent who calls himself Holden--he thinks hes an embodiment of J.D. Salingers literary hero--in this singularly interesting and often misunderstood film that Miguel Arteta directed from an original script by Mike White.

"Movie review Dredd without enough crazy - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Dredd without enough crazy Share Tweet Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 09.20.12 | 503 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Comic book supercop Judge Dredd has never been a character whose city defines him. He was created to be far more enigmatic than that a hard-line law enforcer whose embodiment of a faceless future justice system is perfectly symbolized by the visored biker helmet he always wears. That said his exploits as one-man judge jury and executioner have been very much defined by Mega-City One a post-apocalyptic urban crush of 800 million (said to incorporate Boston lucky us). In the British-published cult comics its a loopily rendered punk-subversive badland whose out-there inhabitants are as big a draw as the hero. ""RoboCop"" always felt like it owed those stories a debt. Hollywoods first stab at capturing all of this straight on was Sylvester Stallones 1995 ""Judge Dredd"" a dopey noisy mess of a movie that read ""subversive"" to mean tossing in Rob Schneider. Now comes ""Dredd"" starring genre-credible Karl Urban (Dr. McCoy in the rebooted ""Star Trek"" franchise). Pretty clearly determined to deliver the antidote to Stallones movie the filmmakers take their cues from Christopher Nolans Batman filmscape dropping Dredd into a fictional concrete sprawl (actually South Africa) thats relentlessly grounded visually and dramatically. In a generic way the environment works. But it drains the material of what should be most unique about it and leaves Urban twisting despite a tightly coiled performance. (Unlike Stallone who could barely be bothered with the helmet Urban never takes it off.) The story dispatches Dredd and his rookie partner psychically gifted Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) to a 200-story tenement ruled by scarred meth-toothed drug queenpin Ma-Ma (Lena Headey ""Game of Thrones""). The crack shes pushing makes time seem like its passing at a micro-fraction of normal speed and director Pete Travis (""Vantage Point"") mines this device for some of the geek-cleverest slo-mo since ""The Matrix."" We get mesmerizingly grisly 3-D looks at bullets shredding facial flesh among other impossibly drawn-out images of punks meeting their doom. If only the villainy or the tone here were half as crazy. Not every dystopian comic book movie needs to play like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" these days. A bit of ""RoboCop"" screwiness would be OK too. Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

Area theaters. The title character in ""Dredd"" never shows his face. And if you were the actor playing him you wouldnt show your face either. Dredd (Karl Urban) is a ""judge"" a futuristic law enforcement officer in a world turned ashen with atomic fallout. (Sylvester Stallone did a full-face version of the established British comics character in 1995.) The eastern U.S. is now clustered into the giant ""Mega City One."" There are huge concrete megacomplexes that cram hundreds of people into vertical slabs. And in one of those Dredd and his trainee partner Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) find themselves trapped and facing the vicious drug matron Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) and her gang. Anderson is a psychic a mutant whose mind-reading abilities come in handy. But they are also handily forgotten at times by screenwriter Alex Garland. Dredd himself is a cypher who resembles Robocop and Urban - so great as the young Dr. McCoy in J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek"" - does as much as he can while turning his mouth into a permanent upside-down U. But these two are merely avatars for rote action scenes involving exploding bodies amputations and the occasional bullet through the face. Unlike say ""Escape From New York"" -- which it resembles -- theres no pulp personality here. Garland and director Pete Travis inject fun when they can. Despite the abject poverty and postapocalyptic conditions people still go shopping in malls and rubberneck at accidents clicking cell cameras. But as with the recent ""Total Recall"" ""Dredd"" is a lot of murk and grunt with no inner engine. And the unnecessary 3-D only makes it look muddier. The drug that Ma-Ma trafficks in Slo-Mo slows its users brain to 1% of its normal speed. ""Dredd"" unfortunately makes you feel as if you too have partaken.

Karl Urban stars in ""Dredd 3D"" but you never actually see his face. Photo Ilze Kitshoff Lionsgate Dredd 3D review Bleak and violent 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dredd 3D Action drama. Starring Karl Urban Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey. Directed by Pete Travis. (R. 95 minutes.) In an age where every other action film references Sept. 11 or the Occupy movement ""Dredd 3D"" is centered squarely on the fears of 1983. An irradiated wasteland. Overpopulation. Society under martial law where police act as judge jury and executioner. Rush lyricist Neil Peart warned us this might happen ... Dont think about it too much - screenwriter Alex Garland certainly didnt. Instead he focuses on the bleak tone simplicity of character and cathartic violence of the comic strip source material. The result is a B-movie success - and the rare superhero film that revels in its carnage instead of stifling it for a PG-13 rating. ""Judge Dredd"" has been a popular British crime fighter since 1977 long before the 1993 ""Judge Dredd"" movie whose atrocities include a gratuitous love interest the removal of Dredds helmet and Rob Schneider as comic relief. This ""Dredd"" features Karl Urban and credit the guy for not having a runaway ego. He talks like an animatronic version of Clint Eastwood and reveals only the bottom third of his face throughout the film. Im guessing 60 percent of the audience will leave the theater thinking hes Thomas Jane. As dystopian futures go the one in ""Dredd"" is pretty bleak. People live in ""Mega-Cities"" where crime is rampant and due process is optional. Judge Dredd and his psychic partner Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) respond to a crime in the low-income tower Peach Trees. Gang leader Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) decides to pin the judges in and execute them. The rest of the movie resembles a claustrophobic ""Assault on Precinct 13."" From the start ""Dredd"" does several things right. -- The backstory takes about 12 seconds. We know nothing about how Dredd became Dredd or even his simplest motivations. Heres your method acting cue Karl This character likes to blow stuff up. -- The movie is a hard ""R."" The street drug ""Slo-mo"" was invented apparently so we can savor each flesh-piercing bullet and body falling 60 stories before turning to pulp on the concrete. Are you getting the sense theres a lot of depraved violence in ""Dredd""? If you dont still pull the wings off flies for fun you should have stopped reading six paragraphs ago. -- The 3-D is good. The drug-use scenes in particular are awash in kaleidoscope colors more akin to the cool practical effects in ""The Tree of Life"" than the usual visual overload. Its not all exploding rainbows and eviscerated unicorns. Sacrifices were made in the name of Hollywood including a very uninspired look at the future - no budget for robots or aliens apparently - and a helmetless (??) sidekick who is clearly too meek for this judge work. Think shell get taken hostage at some point? The themes are also dated. There are times when ""Dredd 3D"" feels like an escapist companion piece to ""The Day After."" But there we go again thinking too much. No sense in ruining such a fine piece of cheap entertainment. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Dredd 3D Fair to good Director Pete Travis. Cast Karl Urban Olivia Thirlby Lena Headey. Rating R for strong violence language drug use and sexual content. This breathless science-fiction thriller isnt just gory. It practically revels in graphic violence with several scenes shot in excruciating slow motion. If you have ever been curious about what a mans cheek looks like as its ripped apart by a bullet wonder no more. All the bloodshed happens in a bleak futuristic world in which people live in ""mega cities."" Law is maintained by helmeted judges essentially modern cops with the ability to issue life-or-death verdicts without little nuisances like Miranda rights. Interview Olivia Thirlby talks Dredd Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is a law enforcer who barks out commands in a rumbling voice. He gets paired with rookie Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) a psychic who doesnt wear the typical judges helmet because it interferes with her paranormal abilities. Its a smart plot device that allows viewers to relate to the rookie whereas Dredd never removes the headpiece and remains something of an enigma. The two wind up trapped in a towering 200-story housing project known as Peach Trees. The movie is ultimately a cat and mouse game between the judges and a vicious drug lord known as Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who has a short jagged haircut that would fit in perfectly with the Go-Gos circa 1984. Director Pete Travis (""Vantage Point"") keeps things moving at a fast pace. There is a macho blustery edge to the action sequences which can be quite exciting. Not-so-thrilling Ma-Ma pushes a drug called Slo-Mo which causes users to experience life at a fraction of its normal speed. Seen once its interesting. Viewed multiple times however the novelty quickly wears off. With its dark characters and the grim setting the film masterfully creates a compelling nightmarish atmosphere. But the relentless action and violence starts to blend together about three-quarters of the way in and you simply long for things to wrap up. It doesnt help that the ending doesnt offer the emotional payoff one would expect from a movie like this. After all its hard to top a bullet through the cheek.

Then theres Dredd 3D a darkly funny blood-soaked romp about a guy in a helmet who kills a lot of people. Karl Urban stars as a supercop locked in a skyscraper filled with criminals who want him dead. Adapted from the same British comic as Stallones forgettable Judge Dredd this one makes the most of a familiar Die Hard-ish premise. Director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle creates an evocative dirty-neon future world. Paul Leonard-Morgans thumping techno soundtrack is thrilling. And Urban manages to give a credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly imitation-Eastwood voice -- and his chin.

At the same time director Pete Travis treatment of the no-nonsense comic book character initially brought to life by Sylvester Stallone in the disposable 1995 adaptation relies on vapid storytelling thats overwhelmingly devoid of imagination. Still enthusiasts of the genre -- still reeling from another summer of men in tights -- should see this comparatively small-scale effort for the sheer volume of contemporary action movie tropes crammed into one concise frenetic experience. Establishing a premise with the typical convenience of an opening voiceover ""Dredd 3D"" delves into a dystopian world where masked judges patrol the crime-riddled streets and dispense justice with the power of jury and executioner behind their every move. While tailing reigning drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) a scar-faced thug prone to violent assaults on her competition the all-business Judge Dredd (Karl Urban his face constantly obscured by a gray visor in a gruff performance one step removed from Robocop) tracks her to a hulking slum and winds up trapped there with rookie agent Anderson (an equally mechanical Olivia Thirlby). With the building on lockdown and gun-toting goons lurking around each corner the two judges work their way toward Mamas private lair while enduring a series of cacophonous showdowns. Paving the way for the tools that fuel each fast-paced twist make-believe ingredients abound The bad guys thrive on an imaginary drug called Slo-mo that slows down the temporal experience of its user to 1%; bullets fly at impossible rates and robotic guns respond to voice commands; Anderson possesses a psychic ability that allows her to run through the minds of her opponents and extract their intel through a slickly presented method of mental abuse. Regardless of these aspects ""Dredd 3D"" draws much of its effectiveness from the physical constraints of its setting. Almost exclusively taking place in a single building the movie unfolds in a series of enclosed spaces. Dredd and Anderson creep down one anonymous corridor after another while the increasingly anxious Ma-Ma watches their progress on a monitor from above. The scenario is virtually identical to the high concept behind the terrific 2011 Indonesian action vehicle ""The Raid Redemption"" which follows a wildly aggressive SWAT team making its way through a deeply fortified Jakarta slum. The limitations take the emphasis off sleek camera work and gratuitous CGI in favor of the claustrophobia of physical engagement a return to the rough edges of a genre with roots in martial arts cinema. The more restricted the action the better and the 3D effects in this case help emphasize robust action sequences that are all about dimensionality. While ""Dredd"" lacks the extensive fight choreography that endowed ""The Raid"" with such visceral energy the new movie compensates with attitude and vision. Deeming the metropolis a ""cursed city"" that only his kind has the power to cure Dredd is a cold figure of objective law with roots stretching back to John Wayne. Complementing its badass protagonist ""Dredd"" features explosive visuals in spite of the dark atmosphere. Expressionistically bright slo-mo sequences bring the impact of the invented drug to vivid life with near-cartoonish imagery that makes the bullet-time sequences of ""The Matrix"" look downright tame. As rap master (and newly minted film director) Ice-T in the audience for the ""Dredd"" premiere screening I recently attended remarked to a friend in the lobby afterward ""them slow-ass bullets was crazy."" In terms of its sights and sounds theres a lot thats crazy about ""Dredd."" Too bad the screenplay which lacks wit or effusiveness to match the films absurd proceedings cant keep up. Neither Dredd nor his sidekick possess the meaty one-liners expected of the slim B-movie format sustaining them. But theres something admirable about this blatantly silly bloodbath. Fans of the genre may even find a nobility to its rambunctious struggle. Fitfully uneven ""Dredd"" is nevertheless an intriguing consolidation of action-movie excess -- and even makes a solid case for its aesthetic appreciation. Thats the one verdict it reaches not with bullets but rather with the reverence for the spectacle they represent. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Lionsgate releases ""Dredd 3D"" on Friday. It may enjoy a solid opening weekend because of tame competition but the gory ingredients and subpar brand recognition may hinder its long-term commercial potential.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Since 1977 comics character Judge Dredd has patrolled Mega City One a post-apocalyptic megalopolis on the East Coast of what used to be the United States. His title doesnt tell the whole story. Like other judges in his grim future hes a combination policeman judicial system and if need be executioner. In the future the law works swiftly and decisively. Due process? The judges are due process. Or as Dredd would put it he is the law. Never more than a cult favorite in the U.S. Judge Dredd has long been iconic in the UK which isnt particularly surprising. The comic contains a vein of ironic dark humor that connects with a greater percentage of British readers than with Americans and though Dredd stories deliver on the violent potential of their dystopian setting theyre often very much within that vein. Making a Dredd movie for global audiences is a tricky proposition. Pander to a bigger crowd by going broad and straying too far from the characters trademarks--by say casting Rob Schneider and Sylvester Stallone as the 1995 film adaptation did--insures losing a chunk of the audience. Dredd a second attempt at making Judge Dredd a movie star overcorrects veering in the opposite direction with a dark--literally and otherwise--nearly humorless bit of ultraviolence distinguished largely by a fondness for spurting CGI blood. Here Cape Town fills in not that convincingly for Mega City One. Its post-apocalyptic cityscape doesnt look that different from those of the 21st century--its just bigger. But its criminals keep the judges busy particularly now that theres a new drug on the street that causes its users to experience life in slow motion. This gives director Pete Travis all the motivation he needs to indulge his inner Zack Snyder particularly in the many close-up scenes filled with the aforementioned unconvincing digital blood. As if he didnt have enough to do Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is charged as the film opens with breaking in a potential new judge (Olivia Thirlby) with a troubled past and incredible psychic powers. Together they attempt to ascend a 200-story housing project whose top floor has been taken over by a ruthless drug dealer named Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who has no objections to taking out a pair of judges if it means staying in business. So up they go through one nondescript corridor after another and the film grows grimmer and less distinctive with each floor. Alex Garlands script lays out the Judge Dredd world early then more or less forgets about it turning Urban and Thirlby into just another pair of cops albeit cops in possession of some futuristic guns. Locked in a scowl and doing his best Clint Eastwood Urban is a fine Dredd though a flavorless one. And Thirlby invests her character with enough vulnerability and determination to avoid getting lost in the noise. Headeys eerily soft-spoken villain gets some good moments but the film is mostly a bunch of flatly staged bits of action shot against anonymous backgrounds. (In 3-D. Because its 2012.) Its 98 minutes of no fun and much gunfire and though its true in some respects to the Dredd of the comics the spirit of the original remains stubbornly on the page.

It was so low-budget that rather than animate the characters talking they would cut a hole in the face and show a real human mouth speaking the dialogue. It was creepy but that effect at least made the kiddie program something of a standout in bizarro pop culture. Dont expect ""Dredd 3D"" to be nearly as memorable despite the fact that actor Karl Urban spends the whole film wearing a helmet that covers practically his entire face leaving only the movements of his mouth to do all the acting. If the 1995 Sylvester Stallone vehicle ""Judge Dredd"" annoyed fans of the original British comics by having the hero wear his trademark helmet too infrequently ""Dredd 3D"" will no doubt put off mainstream audiences by trapping the hero in both headgear and an underwritten screenplay that erase his humanity. In this second big-screen adaptation of the graphic serial created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra Mega City is a post-apocalyptic dystopia covering the area between Washington  D.C. and Boston where newer 200-story atrium blocks sit nestled among crumbling skyscrapers. The citys cops are ""Judges"" entitled not only to enforce the law but also to carry out sentences instantly even when that sentence is death. Judge Dredd is given the task of breaking in rookie Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby); she didnt quite pass training but as her name suggests shes a powerful psychic. What begins as a routine tour of duty through the mean streets of Mega City takes a twist when the two judges apprehend a drug dealer working for notorious crime boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). Not sure enough of his guilt to execute him on the spot the cops plan to haul in their suspect for interrogation. To keep that from happening Ma-Ma puts the whole block on lockdown and instructs the tenants to either kill the judges or to stay out of the way of the coming carnage. And if that sounds identical to the plot of ""The Raid Redemption"" the acclaimed Indonesian import from earlier this year thats because it is. And even if the similarity between the two is pure coincidence ""Dredd 3D"" suffers greatly by comparison as it fails to muster even half of the thrills of its predecessor. Not that ""Dredd 3D"" fails outright The screenplay by Alex Garland (a frequent collaborator of Danny Boyles) and Pete Travis direction offer up occasional moments of ultra-violent jolts and mordant wit like the robot janitor cleaning up the scene of a bloody shopping-center massacre as a mechanical voice chirps ""The Level One food court will reopen in 30 minutes."" But we never get to know Dredd or Cassandra as anything but functionaries of a not-particularly-fresh plot even though the latters psychic abilities are the excuse to let the character go out helmet-less. Ma-Mas main stock in trade is a drug that makes addicts perceive the world in slow motion and its mainly used for some flashy but ultimately pointless shots of water drops and plummeting bodies and random bullets moving frame-by-frame-by-frame. ""Dredd 3D"" is the kind of movie that flirts with a Fascist point of view about law and order but barely acknowledges it while also firing round after round of ammo at its heroes without bothering to explain how they almost never get hit. If this film were a little smarter or a little dumber it might have been a great deal more fun. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

This is thankfully not true of Dredd whose creators have the confidence to treat their narrative like just another episode of their antiheros serialized adventures. Scripted by novelist-turned-screenwriter Alex Garland (The Beach Never Let Me Go) and directed by Pete Travis (the execrable Vantage Point) Dredd is proudly degenerate--and it never feels compelled to slow down and explain itself.The most popular character from proudly pulpy British comics publisher 2000 AD Judge Dredd is something of a symbol for wise-ass irreverence among the relatively austere superhero-heavy landscape. Hes a monster who readers root for simply because watching a super-cop with no sense of human empathy terrorize hapless crooks is subversively funny. But Dredd succeeds where the 1995 Stallone vehicle failed because Travis and Garland dont get hung up on replicating the comics broad sense of humor. Here Judge Joe Dredd (Karl Urban) a cruel lawman whose job allows him to be ""judge jury and executioner"" is trapped in a tenement by drug-dealing sadists and must shoot his way out. There are numerous scenes of ghoulishly exaggerated violence as when a pair of blast doors crash down upon a hapless hobo. But unlike Robocop a film that many of the best Dredd comic stories are indebted to Dredd is played straight. And that can be pretty funny.From the distance provided by introductory helicopter shots of the city the futuristic metropolitan slum of Mega-City One looks fairly staid by the dystopian standards set by Blade Runner among others. Urbans Dredd is likewise not a Schwarzenegger-size goon nor even a Stallone-size guy. (His all-purpose scowl is pretty impressive though his monotone voice suggests Val Kilmers Batman.) When he shoots a hostage-taking thug in the mouth with a phosphorus bullet called a ""Hotshot"" its effectively jarring.Dredds real staying power comes from its creators abject refusal to spell things out. Dredd is a man of few words so Garland makes the ones he has count especially in his scenes with Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) his idealistic rookie partner. Still scenes replicating the effect of slo-mo a sense-enhancing drug peddled by slum lord Ma-Ma (the winning Lena Headey) show more clearly than any of the films ingratiatingly direct dialogue and compelling characterizations just why we root for Urbans more-bad-than-good guy. As bullets rip through flesh and bodies fall through the air accompanied by sparks of light and tinkling glass Travis allows us to revel in amoral spectacle. Yes its bad for you but thats what makes Dredd the hero the comic book film needs now most of all.

A crisp prelude introduces the stunning postapocalyptic setting--a crime-ridden American megalopolis several states long--and our perpetually helmeted antihero (Karl Urban). Dredd is one of numerous ""judges"" with the power to capture sentence and execute those who break the law and today seems like any other day until hes paired with a psychic rookie named Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). The futuristic cops green protege leads them to a slum tower lorded over by the vicious Ma-Ma (Headey) who is peddling a senses-altering drug called Slo-Mo. What follows will be familiar to anyone whos seen the recent martial-arts bone-breaker The Raid Redemption as Dredd and Anderson fight their way through bullets and baddies to reach the big boss woman. But plot similarity or not theres genuine artistry behind the films video-game goals. The impressively lean script by Alex Garland (28 Days Later) is shorn of almost all superfluity beyond a few dud Schwarzeneggeresque kiss-offs while Anthony Dod Mantles sensational widescreen cinematography harkens back to the tension-inducing inventiveness of early John Carpenter (the added dimension is put to terrific use whether in sinewy close-up or 100-story-drop long shot). And Urban gives the best ""all mouth"" performance since the Rocky Horror lips sneering with seen-it-all gruffness and intoning Dredds trademark catchphrase--""I am the law""--with the kind of B-movie-inflected soulfulness that feels damn-near profound. Were a long way from Sly Stallone and Rob Schneider here.

"Dredd | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dredd ) Dredd (United States/United Kingdom 2012) September 18 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Originally Dredd the second motion picture incarnation of the British comic book hero was due for a mid-August U.S. release. Distributor Lionsgate buoyed by a positive reactions at advance screenings decided to move the film out of the ""dumping ground"" wasteland of late summer and into the earliest days of autumn. Despite obvious (but mostly superficial) similarities to The Raid Redemption Dredd can claim to be sufficiently different to avoid being labeled a rip-off. Its also much closer to the comic book than the Hollywood-ized 1995 version that starred Sylvester Stallone in the title role. This time around Judge Dredd is played by Karl Urban although youd never know it was Doctor Leonard McCoy under the mask if not for the credits. As in the comics Dredd never removes his mask so the most we see of Urban are his lips and stubbled chin. Also he speaks in a throaty growl that sounds a lot like Christian Bales Batman. Dredd is less a character than an icon. He shows no emotion and although he utters the occasional one-liner hes as straightforward as they come. Think Robocop. As in The Raid Redemption this is about an attempt by law enforcement officers to infiltrate a high rise building that has been co-opted by gangsters fight their way to the top and take out the chief bad guys. The Raid Redemption is more bloody and visceral but Dredd offers its own pleasures chief of which is a scene of mayhem in which the villain Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) takes out an entire floor of the complex in a futile attempt to kill two judges. Its pretty spectacular stuff. And once Dredd runs out of ammo the level of tension escalates remarkably. Dredd has an associate rookie judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) a mop-haired blond who eschews headgear. She is being assessed for a pass/fail grade by Dredd. Her test scores were judged ""marginal"" but she has been accorded an opportunity in the field because of her impressive psychic abilities. Shes unprepared for Dredds brutality but adapts quickly. She also plays mind games with a prisoner they take during their initial raid of the Peach Tree high rise. Kay (Wood Harris) knows something about Ma-Ma that she doesnt want him to tell anyone and Anderson goes mucking around in his mind out to find out what it is. It turns out that Peach Tree is ground zero for the manufacture and distribution of a new drug Slo-Mo (makes the brain think time is moving at 1% of actual speed) and theres nothing Ma-Ma wont do to protect that secret. Trapping two judges in the building and hunting them down is childs play. Or so she thinks. The action scenes are graphic and well choreographed with a slightly artistic edge. Visually Dredd is impressive with the digital rendering of Mega-City One offering the most satisfying helping of visual candy. Dredd was filmed in 3-D but there are problems. Most of these occur during special effects-laden scenes that attempt to represent reality through a Slo-Mo filter. The 3-D comes across as artificial and overdone in these sequences. There is also noticeable blur during a few of the action scenes. Director Pete Travis does however solve the problem of things being too dark. Dredd has just about the right level of lighting. If theres a serious disappointment its the villain. Ma-Ma despite being played with over-the-top zest by Lena Headey isnt a very impressive foil for the mighty Judge Dredd even when she calls for ""back-up."" Heady is so inconsequential that the final confrontation seems more like an afterthought than an important moment in the story. Its a little like Superman confronting Lex Luthor except in this case Lex doesnt have any Kryptonite on hand. Unlike many post-apocalyptic scenarios the one presented in Dredd offers sufficient glimpses of a dystopian future without overselling the dark ugly miseries of this future. The background is strong enough to make some of the movies more outlandish elements seem credible and to represent the dour Judge Dredd as a paragon of justice. Theres also a fair amount of dark humor often of the gallows variety that never seems out-of-place. Not much of what Dredd has to offer is new or groundbreaking but the fusion of familiar elements generates a smartly-paced suspenseful 90 minutes thats a vast improvement over the 1995 film although not quite on par with The Raid Redemption when it comes to pure unexpurgated action.

"TIFF 2012 52 films reviewed | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTIFF 2012 52 films reviewedFrom After the Battle to West of Memphis our writers have TIFF films covered. With more to come.Karl Urban in TIFFs Midnight Madness opener Dredd 3D.  (ALLIANCE FILMS)  Thu. Aug. 30 2012Wondering what to see at this months Toronto International Film Festival? Here is a selection of capsule reviews by Star movie critic Peter Howell movie writer Linda Barnard and entertainment writers Bruce DeMara Raju Mudhar and Tony Wong. Titles of recommended movies are preceded by a . Find screening times and other festival information at tiff.net/thefestival.90 Minutes Norways Eva Sorhaug crafts a drama that is deceptively banal in the early going introducing a trio of everyday domestic situations and then she pulls her camera back and were suddenly in different hellish scenarios. Straddling horror and social commentary all are linked to the exploration of the final 90 minutes of life. This challenging film isnt easy viewing but its brave filmmaking that explores violence in society a topic that resonates given the recent sentencing of Norwegian mass murderer Anders Brevik. Linda BarnardAfter the Battle A soapy story dulls Yousry Nasrallahs Egyptian timely drama of the aftermath of the Arab Spring social uprisings which nevertheless asks the pointed question Whats more important jobs or democracy? Based on ""The Battle of the Camels"" of early 2011 in which camel and horse riders clashed with government forces in Tahrir Square it follows the travails of humble horseman Mahmoud (Bassem Samra) who gets caught in life-changing events both in the street and at home (female trouble times two). All politics may be personal but this just gets simplistic and sudsy. Peter HowellAmour Michael Hanekes dramatic two-hander the Palme dOr winner at Cannes 2012 is a quietly devastating illustration of how tough the ""for better or worse"" marriage pact can be when ""or worse"" occurs. An elderly couple (veteran French actors Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva) are put to the test when the wife suffers one stroke and then another robbing her first of speech and then mobility. Together they must find a way to endure as the end approaches. Its one of the simplest and arguably the most passionate films of Hanekes incredible career sure to be a candidate for Best Foreign-Language Film at the next Academy Awards. PHAnna Karenina Joe Wrights high-concept retelling of Tolstoys famous morality tale about love seduction and duty (aided with a pared-down script by Oscar-winner Tom Stoppard) wont be everybodys cup of borscht. But it is so gorgeous and stylistically wrought its hard to take your eyes off the elaborate spectacle. Wrights version takes place in a lavish 19th-century theatre much of it onstage. The carefully choreographed set pieces and stunning costumes highlight Keira Knightleys measured portrayal of the alternating flighty and tragic heroine with Jude Law as her reserved cuckolded husband Alexei and Aaron Johnson as the dashing Count Vronsky who steals her heart and destroys her soul. LBArticle Continued BelowAntiviral Obviously influenced by his dad Davids early work but also showing a strong personal style Brandon Cronenbergs feature debut is a dark satire with a point -- a needle point. It presents a dire future world where celebrity worship has degraded to the degree where the illnesses and cloned flesh of the famous are sold to obsessed admirers who are eager to share the pain. Caleb Landry Jones (X-Men First Class) is a disease hustler whose schemes hit fever pitch; Sarah Gadon (Cosmopolis) is his infected infatuation. Its visceral but it definitely grows on you. PHArgo Ben Affleck skillfully manipulates the tension in edge-of-your-seat thriller Argo a story thats familiar to Canadians but is anything but predictable. The Canadian Caper where six Americans sought refuge at Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylors Tehran residence following bloody student uprisings gets a dramatic new chapter when CIA exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) comes up with a radical idea to get then out of the country by helping them pose as a Canadian film crew on a location scout. Alan Arkin almost steals the picture as Hollywood producer Lester Siegel shades of Dustin Hoffman in Wag the Dog. LBAt Any Price Iowas farmlands form an unlikely backdrop for this tale of father-son conflict set in the high-stakes world of modern agri-business. Dennis Quaid shines as the Great Santini of the seed corn sales world a farmer spouting advice likely gleaned from motivational posters to his son Dean (Zac Efron) who sees his future on the NASCAR track not in the field. The in-car track scenes are intense; so is Quaids performance as a desperate man who sees ethics and morality in shades of grey. Newcomer Maika Monroe is impressive as Deans girlfriend and Efron does well as a sullen kid whose dreams die hard but this is Quaids picture. LBBerberian Sound Studio Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. But do look closely at the timid little English guy in the Italian sound studio who is slowly unraveling like an old reel-to-reel tape. Mamas boy Gilderoy (Toby Jones) is out of his comfort zone (and possibly his mind) working audio for a schlocky Italian horror film which the bullying director and producer have made an ordeal on both sides of the microphone. Writer/director Peter Strickland hat-tips David Lynchs Mulholland Drive for this descent-into-madness psychodrama but its smartly done. Bonus is the demonstration of old-school foley effects -- who knew a radish could terrify? PHBestiaire Canadian auteur Denis Cote normally confines his astringent gaze to the odd workings of the human animal. Here he shares the frame with beasts of fur and horn at a Quebec safari park where stares of curiosity and indifference flash between both sides of the cage. And look closely at how Cote approaches those metal bars -- youre never quite sure what will pop into view and who the real prisoners are. Equally inspired by a medieval picture book and by our chronic disrespect for the natural world Cotes quietly awesome film insists its our minds that are really locked up. PHBeyond the Hills God and the devil work in mysterious ways for beset nuns in a remote Moldavian monastery as two close friends fall on opposite sides of strict ideology. Romanias Cristian Mungiu masterly directs this heartbreaking tug of faith vs. free will which deservedly won a shared Best Actress award for female leads Cosmina Stratan and Cristina Flutur at the Cannes Film Festival in May. PHBurn It Up Djassa The music is hot and the steel is cold in this ghetto tragedy a searing debut by Ivory Coast director Lonesome Solo. Rebel youth Tony (Abdoul Karim Konate) carries both a tune and a chip on his shoulder as he swaggers through his Abidjan neighbourhood of Wassakara. He watches his reckless young sister (Adelaide Ouattara) and maintains cool relations with his cop brother (Mamadou Diomande) but then the tough words of a gangbanger narrator start to sound more like prophecy than braggadocio. PHDetroit Unleaded Lebanese-American filmmaker Rola Nashef makes an entertaining debut with Detroit Unleaded an Arab-American culture-clash comedy with a distinct Clerks vibe set in a family-owned gas station in a rundown Detroit hood. Sami (E.J. Assi) who works in the bulletproof cage installed after his dad was gunned down while running the gas-mart has bigger dreams than his co-owner cousins limited ambitions. Chief among them is getting together with spirited beauty Naj (Nada Shouhayib). But there are strict rules of behaviour among these guys and gals that hardly favour women even if it is America cuz. LBDredd 3D This film adaptation of the beloved British comic wipes the slate clean from the stink of the 1995 version starring Sylvester Stallone. Set in a post-apocalyptic future in which 800 million people live in Mega City One Dredd (Karl Urban) has to take a rookie judge (Olivia Thirlby) with psychic powers out to investigate a homicide in a 200-storey slum. The only flaw is that some of the effects combined with 3D wind up looking cartoony and unintentionally hilarious. Essentially a futuristic take on Die Hard or The Raid Redemption this is a violent gory and faithful execution of the character that fans should rejoice at. Raju MudharThe End of Time Peter Mettlers poetic lens has inquired into everything from personal fulfillment (Gambling Gods and LSD) to the Northern Lights (Picture of Light). Now hes after his most elusive prey yet the very human concept of time. Following a global path that leads him from a pro-astronaut to proton smashers and from a Hawaiian lava watcher to Henry Fords defunct Detroit assembly line the Toronto cinematographer/director makes a profound statement on what makes all of us tick. Its of a piece with Patricio Guzmans Nostalgia for the Light a film that similarly finds miraculous unity in seemingly random things. PHFoxfire Confessions of a Girl Gang Cannes Palme dOr winner Laurent Cantet (The Class) wrote the screenplay and directs this compelling drama that sticks closely to Joyce Carol Oates novel about a girl gang in 1950s upstate New York (filmed in Sault Ste. Marie Ont.) and their charismatic revolutionary-minded leader Margaret ""Legs"" Sadovsky. Impressive performances from Canadian actresses -- mostly newcomers -- as the teens from the wrong side of the tracks who fight back when wronged by local males. Far superior to the 1996 film version that starred a then-unknown Angelina Jolie as Legs. LBFree Angela amp; All Political Prisoners A new generation meets a legendary activist and educator in Shola Lynchs sympathetic and powerful portrait of Angela Davis a stunning orator who struck fear into the heart of the white establishment in the turbulent late 1960s. Fired from her UCLA teaching post for being a member of the Communist Party Davis bought guns in the wake of death threats. What followed made her an international lightning rod for racial equality and human rights whose image -- a willowy woman with a massive afro -- became a pop culture fixture. Not all questions are answered by Davis now 68 and others interviewed which makes the doc less impactful that it could have been. LBHotel Transylvania Every movie monster ever imagined seems to have been included in this tale from Sony Pictures Animation. That means adults as well as older kids -- say 12 and up -- can share the fun in this wacky fast-paced story about a vampire (voiced by Adam Sandler) who presides over a hotel resort for monsters with zombie bellhops and witches with broomsticks as maids as he tries to protect his daughter from the dangerous world outside -- dangerous to monsters at least. The 3D effects are dizzying at times but marvelous and the wit and zaniness is maintained throughout. Bruce DeMara.The Hunt Mads Mikkelsen deservedly won the Best Actor award at Cannes for his role as a 40-year-old kindergarten teacher whose life is all but destroyed after a young girl falsely accuses him of sexual impropriety. Before the quiet teacher has a chance to defend himself he is attacked and ostracized by rush-to-judgment vigilantes his best friend among them. Denmarks Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration) directs with confidence engaging the mind and tweaking the conscience. PHHyde Park on Hudson Bill Murray makes a charming Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Laura Linney a stoic mistress Daisy but theyve both got their work cut out for them with the wafer-thin screenplay which Richard Nelson adapted from his BBC radio play of the same name. Titled for FDRs upstate New York retreat where Americas longest-serving president took refuge -- and rumoured sexual liaisons -- as World War II threatened Roger Michells film struggles for definition as either daffy comedy or insiders view of history. Samuel West and Olivia Colman steal scenes as visiting King George VI and wife Queen Elizabeth (the future Queen Mum) befuddled by hot dogs and emboldened by booze but The Kings Speech 2 this isnt. PHIn Another Country Beach puzzler plays to fans of Hong Sang-soos frolics but wont expand the South Korean masters reach even with a very game Isabelle Huppert adding some marquee appeal. She plays three different women each named Anne in three stories that pivot around the same hotel in the seaside resort town of Mohang. Each Anne is a figment of an imaginative film student seeking anxiety relief. The title tips to this as a funhouse mirror image of Hongs earlier Night and Day in which Koreans visiting Paris grapple with French culture. PHInescapable Canadian writer/director Rubba Nadda reteams with Cairo Time star Alexander Siddig for a timely but uneven political thriller set just as the Arab Spring is poised to set Syria aflame. A former intelligence agent Adib (Siddig) is forced to return to his homeland to rescue his daughter Muna who has gone to Damascus to learn more about her fathers mysterious past. In a country with no less than 15 different spy agencies Adib must turn to old contacts as he navigates his way through a deadly maze of intrigue and deceit. Nadda nails some of the paranoia and claustrophobia of living in a police state though the end result is not entirely satisfying. BDIn the Fog A better title might be Ivan for All Seasons a WWII Russian railway workers claimed nyet to Nazi finkdom is disbelieved by his comrades in a German-occupied Belorussian village. An opening hanging shows the cost of resisting and also the fury of villagers seeking a scapegoat. As accused worker Sushenya (Vladimir Svirski) is marched to certain doom flashbacks reveal how truth is the real fog of this war. Insightful dialogue and acting partially redeem a glacial pace in this second feature by My Joys Sergei Loznitsa. PHKrivina Haunted and homesick Bosnian immigrant Miro (Goran Slavkovic) finds life in Toronto trying. Rootless by nature and circumstance he returns to his homeland after receiving word that his old friend Dado not seen for 20 years has been accused of war crimes. But which man is he really seeking? Torontos Igor Drljaca turns detective work into surreal poetry in his absorbing feature debut leaving us to fill in the gaps as he follows a winding path Joseph Conrad and Raymond Chandler might recognize. The camera hovers expectantly; the sound hints of menace. PHA Late Quartet As an acclaimed international string quartet gets ready to celebrate its 25th anniversary an announcement by its most senior member throws the company into a crisis that threatens to tear the company apart. Director/co-writer Yaron Zilberman has assembled a master class of great actors including Christopher Walken Philip Seymour Hoffman Catherine Keener and Mark Ivanir to spin a story that may seem too highbrow for some tastes but is in fact pleasingly filled with down-to-earth passion. BDLaurence Anyways The third feature by Quebecs Xavier Dolan (Jai tue ma mere) isnt an outright failure but neither is it an unqualified success. Its a gender-identity love story between a man named Laurence (Melvil Poupaud) who believes hes really female and a woman named Fred (Suzanne Clement) who isnt quite sure whether her heart beats according to gender or to desire. Poupaud and Clement render love and confusion with equal empathy but Dolan indulges himself with a flabby screenplay. The story just doesnt have the heft that its 161-minute running time implies. PHLeviathan Ever been to sea Billy? Youll feel right in the deep watching this astonishing piece of pure cinema which forsakes narrative for its you-are-there trawl through the conjoined lives of fishermen and their various catches in the waters of New Bedford Mass. Its the legendary place where Herman Melville situated Moby Dick and every twitch of a tattooed muscle flick of a fin crash of a wave and squawk of seagull is nabbed by a battery of cameras with the footage edited for maximum immersion. Emphatically not for three-act moviegoers or the easily seasick. But the adventurous will be hooked by what co-directors Lucien Castaing-Taylor (Sweetgrass) and Verena Paravel have wrought. PHLike Someone in Love More droll than profound Abbas Kiarostamis first Japanese sojourn tolls missed connections and lost chances in a muddled narrative that skirts fantasy and reality. An elderly professor (Tadashi Okuno) falls for a Tokyo call girl (Rin Takanashi) who is leading a double life a student by day she walks the streets by night. Kiarostami seems under some kind of spell too. Entranced by the glamour of a new city the Iranian master stays on the surface failing to find meaning in ambiguity as he did so well with Certified Copy a 2010 film that still resonates. PHLooper A sci-fi film may seem odd for this years TIFF gala opener but its not your usual raygun routine. Skillfully bending genres since he first smashed with Brick in 2005 Rian Johnson puts that films star Joseph Gordon-Levitt into an identity-crisis thriller set in the Kansas of 2044. JGL plays Joe a ""looper"" (hit man) working for innovative mobsters of the year 2074 who use a time machine to send their victims back three decades for untraceable bullets and burning. Fast cash is just a shot away for ice-cool Joe and his blunderbuss -- until a new crime kingpin decides to ""close the loop"" and the mirror threatens. Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt co-star in this future shocker with smarts. PHLove is All You Need Denmarks Oscar-winning Susanne Bier (In a Better World) turns Woody Allen for this Italy-set romantic comedy of love after rejection even using (and overusing) Dean Martins ""Thats Amore"" for its cheesy soundtrack. But theres some real grit mixed with the treacle and strong lead performances by Piers Brosnan as a workaholic and grumpy businessman and Trine Dyrholm as the hairdresser who may just tame this lions mane. A big bonus is the gorgeous photography of its sun-drenched Sorrento locale. PHMekong Hotel Waters are rising and so are strange spirits in the latest by Thailands multimedia artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul who won the 2010 Palme dOr at Cannes for his poetic ghost story Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. More a collection of ideas than a fully realized concept essentially visual notes for an older unproduced project called Ecstasy Garden the one-hour film packs young romantics obscure ghosts and a maternal vampire in a hotel overlooking the Mekong River in northeast Thailand. Gorgeous acoustic guitar brings everything together imparting a mood of melancholy under Apichatpongs serene gaze. PHOn the Road Yasss yasss . . . Director Walter Salles (The Motorcycle Diaries) really gets Sal Dean Marylou amp; Kerouac amp; all the madness amp; sadness amp; angels along the road to enlightenment as Jack Kerouacs 1957 Beat Generation novel finally hits the big screen. Long feared unfilmable due to its fragmented narrative and jazz-influenced dialogue it comes together very nicely under the completely engaged direction of Salles. He guides an eager cast that includes Twilight star Kristen Stewart plus Sam Riley Garrett Hedlund Kirsten Dunst and Viggo Mortensen. PHNo Gael Garcia Bernal plays a Chilean version of Mad Mens advertising ace Don Draper called upon to sell the ""no"" side of a national plebiscite that will confirm or topple the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet -- and the fix for ""si"" is likely already in. Based on real events of 1988 Pablo Larrains tightly framed film is a mesmerizing realistic and often hilarious look at the cynical politics of power and the magic required to sell a negative as a positive. Say yes to No. PHThe Paperboy A urinating Nicole Kidman shirtless Zac Efron relentless ShakyCam and a croc-bitten script add up to bad news in this campy and swampy melodrama by Lee Daniels (Precious). Set in a racially charged and kinky Florida of the 1960s and narrated by Macy Gray it has Matthew McConaughey as a newshound chasing a scoop about John Cusacks death-row inmate with eyebrow-raising interruptions from a hot-to-trot Kidman and a bedazzled Efron. Theres a lot of heavy breathing on the screen but youll be the one seeking the cold shower afterwards. PHParadise Love Ulrich Seidls depressing sex-tourism satire plays as cautionary tale for libidinous travellers. It follows the sexcapades of Teresa (Margarethe Tiesel) a lonely 50-year-old Austrian who treks to Kenya seeking easy bedspring action. She has no idea what shes getting into. By turns amusing frightening and anything but erotic the film should be mandatory viewing for anyone who thinks sex tourism is a romp. But it leaves you hoping Seidl forgets about plans to make this part of a trilogy. PHThe Perks of Being a Wallflower Sure to resonate with the generation that grew up with and revered his 1999 young adult novel writer Stephen Chbosky who also directs has made a film version that is clearly dedicated to them. Charlie (Logan Lerman) a shy freshman newly emerged from a painful depression tries to fit in at high school and does so with the help of Sam (Emma Watson in her first big post-Harry Potter role) and her stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller). Its no John Hughes reinvention; these kids are more self-absorbed than insightful. LBPost Tenebras Lux A devil carrying a toolbox a man ripping off his own head and a nude orgy are just some of the cascading images in Carlos Reygadass latest and most personal film which won the directing prize at Cannes despite baffling many who saw it. The title roughly translates as ""After Darkness Light"" hinting at spiritual redemption. Whether it all adds up to anything meaningful or if Reygadas even intends it to have any literal meaning may be all in the eye of beholders -- who will be held in thrall regardless. PHOut in the Dark Israeli-born director Michael Mayer co-wrote his first feature-length film about two gay men -- one Israeli one Palestinian -- whose love for each other meets all kinds of obstacles including the division caused by long-standing political issues and conservative family values. Nicholas Jacob as Nimr and Michael Aloni as Roy demonstrate great screen chemistry as the star-crossed lovers in a film that challenges the Arabic proverb love finds its way. BDPicture Day TIFF 2012 Rising Star Tatiana Maslany stars in made-in-Toronto Picture Day as Claire a rebellious teen who appears outwardly annoyed to be repeating her final year of high school but secretly finds it an ideal place to hide out from the adult world. Maslany is terrific as the world-weary smart-talking teen who falls for older musician Jim (Steve McCarthy) while best bud Henry (Spencer Van Wyck) the kid she once babysat pines for her. First-time feature writer-director Kate Melville shows promise working with a bare-bones production budget that adds a pleasing roughness to the film. LBQuelques Heures de Printemps Gravel-voiced French actor Vincent Lindon plays recent prison parolee Alain a 48-year-old single former truck driver whose error in judgment forces him to move back home with his mother wonderfully underplayed by Helene Vincent. Theres clearly history between these two but will his mothers cancer diagnosis and her decision to take some drastic action as a result change their stormy relationship? A methodical film director Stephane Brize saves the best for last delivering a finale with an emotional jolt. LBReality Matteo Garrone won the second-place Grand Prix at Cannes 2008 for his Mafia drama Gomorrah and he nabbed the honour again this year for this darkly satirical dive into the emotional swamp of reality TV. When humble Naples fishmonger Luciano (Aniello Arena) is invited to audition to be one of the contestants on the Italian version of Big Brother his first reaction is to scoff. Hes one of the most level-headed people in his neighbourhood and he has a wife (Loredana Simioli) and three children to support. But when it suddenly seems that Luciano might actually land a Big Brother spot ego and ambition cloud his mind. Reality understands how fame can corrupt even those who arent famous. PHRebelle (War Witch) The ghosts of murdered villagers that haunt a young girl brutally forced to become a child soldier in Montreal writer-director Kim Nguyens much-lauded Rebelle mirror the films effect on an audience. Much of it is down to Congolese native and screen newcomer Rachel Mwanza whose award-winning natural performance as Komona made to join a ragtag rebel force in an unnamed African country at age 12 amid unspeakable cruelty is riveting. LBThe Road North His wife has left him and Helsinki concert pianist Timo (Samuli Edelmann) is doing his best to hold up the cliche about dour Finns in Mika Kaurismakis charming father-and-son road trip comedy. But his absentee dad fat wheezy chainsmoking Leo (a wonderfully dry comic turn by Vesa-Matti Loiri) shows up on his doorstep after 30 years and has other ideas about life and love. Leo who isnt too good with playing by the rules wants Timo to drive him to northern Finland where he some startling answers await about why he walked out on his family. LBRoom 237 That room number opens the door to the darkest corner of Stanley Kubrick worship wherein rabid fans of the late directors The Shining congregate online to speculate about supposedly hidden messages in the film. Director Rodney Ascher discovers several strands of conspiracy theories including a faked Apollo 11 moon landing and Nazi Holocaust and Native American genocide allegories. The common thread is that Kubrick must have been making more than just a simple adaptation of Stephen Kings spooky hotel story when he filmed his 1980 chiller. The really creepy thing is that some of these loons actually make sense. PHA Royal Affair This Lavish Danish costume drama offers fresh perspective on the true story of King Christian VII and the country doctor who ended up running Denmark in his stead. Childish and mad -- played with awards-worthy depth by Mikkel Folsgaard -- the king is hardly a welcome sight for his justifiably unhappy wife Caroline (Alicia Vikander) who narrates the story. Mads Mikkelsen is compelling as German country doctor Johann Friedrich Struensee who arrives bearing ideas from the Enlightenment. He gains the kings trust and eventually considerable political power. With his eye on social reform not personal gain hes also smitten with Caroline. Lovely to look at and filled with intrigue its a satisfying period piece. LBRust and Bone Best Actress Oscar winner Marion Cotillard makes a strong bid for a repeat win with her uncompromising performance as an amputee seeking and resisting love in this French melodrama by Jacques Audiard (A Prophet). Cotillard bravely eschews both makeup and modesty in the role of Stephanie a trainer of killer whales who is drawn into an unlikely and uncertain romance with a hard-nosed street brawler (Matthias Schoenaerts) after a workplace tragedy radically alters her body and her life. PHThe Secret Disco Revolution Toronto documentarian Jamie Kastner takes a satirical approach to the rise and fall of disco using a trio of Spandex and polyester-clad groovesters to explore his mock-scholarly theory that an underground manifesto furthering sexual racial and gay liberation gave rise to the four-four beat revolution. Its all an excuse to compile impressive dance-floor footage of the oogie-boogie era along with interviews with former disco royalty like The Village People and Gloria Gaynor. Theres even some egghead input as University of Southern California professor Alice Echols explains Donna Summers ""Love to Love You Baby"" is actually ""the feminist critique of three-minute sex."" LBThe Sessions A gentle often very funny and unblinkingly honest look at physical intimacy and the disabled The Sessions stars John Hawkes (Winters Bone) as writer Mark OBrien who spends his life in an iron lung but yearns for human touch -- of the erotic kind. Enter Helen Hunt as the sex surrogate who helps fulfill his wish to lose his virginity. William H. Macy co-stars as a sympathetic priest. This Sundance crowd pleaser was a double winner at the fest with good reason. LBSmashed A superb career-making performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate a young married Grade 1 teacher who is what they call a ""high-functioning alcoholic."" Her husband (Aaron Paul) is her drinking buddy but the party is getting increasingly out of hand as evidenced in the first shocking scenes. The script goes to some predictable places but is lifted by the supporting cast especially Megan Mullally as her trusting principal and Mary Kay Place as Kates similarly afflicted mother. LBStories We Tell Actor/filmmaker Sarah Polleys personal documentary is extraordinary in every way from its post-modern structure to the raw emotion of its carefully revealed family secrets. Dont go by the TIFF program book which discreetly holds back crucial info the film isnt just about any family but Polleys own. She and her loved ones summon the necessary courage not only to delve into extremely difficult subjects but also to face up to life-altering consequences. Its a film of truth memory and reconciliation with no clear path. You just have to trust in Polleys steely determination and follow her relentless lens. In a word WOW. PHTabu Is Tabu about the relationship of a woman with her housekeeper or is it about the legacy of Portuguese colonialism and the emotional burden of an oppressive past? At the end of Portuguese director Miguel Gomess black and white melodrama it doesnt really matter because the reward is a stunning photographic narrative -- a love story told as sweeping parable. But to get there takes an investment by the viewer. Still Tabu is accessible because it never strays from the idea that it is about the most base of human emotions -- even if told with an unconventional sensibility. Tony WongTower Underachieving Torontonian Derek (Derek Bogart vivid) still has his wisdom teeth at age 34 but they dont attest to much wisdom. He has yet to launch from the parental home works without zeal at his uncles construction firm and fidgets with a cartoon a girl and a pesky raccoon. Sounds sitcomish but its defiantly and deliriously not so Kazik Radwanskis captivating feature debut framed tightly and in shallow focus pulls us face-to-face with a character who seems about to explode at any moment. PHWest of Memphis Oscar-winning filmmaker Amy Berg (Deliver Us From Evil) is a camera-toting crusader to right a lengthy wrong done to three teenage boys. Several witnesses tearfully recant testimony onscreen while DNA evidence points to a shocking new suspect in the case that saw a trio of innocent Arkansas teens -- dubbed the West Memphis 3 -- jailed for 18 years for the murders of three 8-year-old boys. The docs revelations are based on fresh evidence gathered by private investigators hired by The Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson and his wife Fran Walsh who are also co-producers on the documentary along with Damien Echols one of the charged and his wife Lori Davis. A stunning look at a miscarriage of justice that nearly ended in Echols execution.

Daily Edition Login to download Dredd 3D Film Review 1040 AM PDT 9/2/2012 by Stephen Dalton FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Cult comic-strip character rebooted for the 3D age TWITTER Futuristic lawman returns in superior sci-fi action thriller scripted by Alex Garland. A cult anti-hero born 35 years ago on the pages of the long-running British comic book 2000 AD Judge Dredd began life as a kind of futuristic Dirty Harry an ultraviolent fantasy of a US lawman policing a dystopian Blade Runner universe. His fascistic worldview dispensing hard-edged instant justice on the mean streets of Mega City One offered readers both a guilty pleasure and a darkly satirical commentary on Anglo-American society in the late 1970s just as punk rock was fading and the Thatcher-Reagan era was dawning. In Dredd 3D this evergreen pop-culture icon gets rebooted for the 21st century by Alex Garland author of The Beach and screenwriter of 28 Days Later among many others. A previous attempt to bring Dredd to the screen director Danny Cannons 1995 star vehicle for Sylvester Stallone impressed neither serious fans nor mainstream movie-goers. But Garland and director Pete Travis deliver a sharper and better film more faithful to the original comic but careful not to be too culturally specific and targeted squarely at the huge global market for sci-fi thrillers. While its R rating will inevitably limit commercial potential this is a superior genre piece which ticks enough effects-heavy action-franchise boxes to generate healthy box office. Where Cannons film was geographically expansive clumsily comic and heavily sanitised for family viewing Dredd 3D takes exactly the opposite approach. The violence here is graphic and gory taking full advantage of that R rating. The dark ironic very British humour of the original strip has been largely excised. And nine-tenths of the story takes place inside a single location a vast housing project which has become a lawless high-rise ghetto controlled by the ruthlessly sadistic drugs pusher and crime boss Ma-Ma (Headey). When Dredd (Urban) and his rookie partner the psychic Judge Anderson (Thirlby) arrive to investigate a triple homicide they become prisoners of this violent mega-slum fighting for survival against Ma-Mas heavily armed foot soldiers. The limited location computer game-style plot and muted humour of Dredd 3D may disappoint hardcore fans of the comic book. While the vast post-apocalyptic sprawl of Mega City One almost functioned like a main character in the original strips here we only see it in teasing glimpses as a chaotic concrete jungle stretching off to the far horizon. Most of the film was shot in South Africa which perhaps explains why this ostensibly US Eastern seaboard cityscape looks more like Johannesburg than Boston or Manhattan. Dredd purists will perhaps approve more of Karl Urbans minimalist portrayal barking terse commands from behind his ever-present mask in-keeping with his comic-strip blueprint. But it still lacks something a one-dimensional performance in a three-dimensional film. The Die Hard-level plot also contains a few risibly silly contrivances notably the photogenic Anderson being sent into an urban war zone despite forgetting to wear her protective helmet. Doh That said Dredd 3D constantly impresses on a visual level with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters. The esteemed British cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle best known for his Lars Von Trier collaborations and his Oscar-winning work on Danny Boyles Slumdog Millionaire adds to the projects overall air of high-level craftsmanship. His first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences. Imagine the balletic slowed-down carnage of vintage Sam Peckinpah or John Woo but taken to the next technological level. Pitched at the right level to please original fans but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones Dredd 3D feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre. Even 35 years later Judge Dredd still packs a hard punch. Go ahead punk. Make his day.

""Guilty pleasure"" is a term youll often hear associated with action films like ""Dredd 3D"". But I say ""no more"" to this whole line of thought. We must cast off our guilt as that guilt is built upon the faulty premise that an action movie cant bring anything more to the table than spectacle. Not so for this movie. This time around feel free to stow your shame firmly at the door. Get on board with Karl Urban It sounds like sacrilege but ""Dredd 3D"" is the rare remake/reboot thats actually far superior to the original. One could make the case that it was only a sentimental and misplaced nostalgia that even allowed for this version to exist but it doesnt excuse the fact that Sly Stallones ""Judge Dredd"" was a cheesy wreck. Lovable? Sure just like a puppy and with similar messiness issues. Thankfully ""Dredd 3D"" is a real movie with a logical plot and solid action. Featuring dynamic acting even In the future world of ""Dredd 3D"" only 80 million people have survived and all of them are inhabitants of Mega-City 1. They are arranged in districts and judges (like our buddy Dredd) act as policeman juries and executioners where the law is concerned. Dredd (Karl Urban) must choose the crimes he prosecutes carefully as there are 12 crimes in the city every minute and very few judges are left to mete out justice. On this particular day Dredd finds himself saddled with a trainee named Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). Its a classic ""Traning Day"" scenario and weve all been there. The mismatched duo heads off to sector 13 to a concrete hamlet charmingly named ""Peach Trees"" home to 75000 citizens and one absolutely ruthless gang called the Ma-Mas. Also Check Out Stars Take the Red Carpet at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) is the diabolical leader of the Ma-Mas fittingly and shes decided she cant allow Dredd and Anderson to interrogate one of her gang captains. Have you ever met a person who just wont listen to reason? Thats Dredd vs. Ma-Ma two stone-cold hard cases with legitimate iron wills. Dredd isnt leaving until Ma-Ma faces judgement ... and Ma-Ma isnt going anywhere or being judged on any level by Judge Dredd. Immovable object meet the unstoppable force. This antagonistic relationship informs the entire plot so your enjoyment of this stubbornly violent dichotomy will go a long way toward forming your overall opinion of the movie. On the acting front Karl Urban owns the part of Judge Dredd. Hes got none of the silliness of the original ""Judge Dredd"" instead replacing it with a determined scowl and a gruff surliness. Lena Headey also does legitimate work as Ma-Ma channeling her best impression of Gary Oldman from ""True Romance."" Olivia Thirlby brings a quiet competence to trainee Anderson alternating vulnerability with a ""fail fast forward"" mentality that youd expect out of a recruit. Then there is the action quotient which is high to quite high. While Im not convinced that this film exactly needed to be in 3-D I was at least impressed with the overall level of visual effects. The Ma-Mas are drug traffickers peddling a narcotic named ""Slo-mo"" and the film does excellent work in showing off the drugs effects. The pacing is also stellar theres not a dull moment but its also not completely frenetic and aimless. As we pass judgment on ""Dredd"" its clear that the only guilt you should feel is if you skip it entirely. Other than that sit back and enjoy the movie earns every morsel of entertainment goodness.

Alex Garlands script for this return to Mega City One is lazy and derivative the characters are slight and the twists unconvincing while a presumably accidental but highly conspicuous similarity to the plot of this years The Raid robs it of any sense of surprise. So respect is due to director Pete Travis who from these humble beginnings has fashioned a dynamic entertaining and visually sensational action romp.Karl Urban plays Judge Dredd a fascistic future cop with the right to try and execute wrongdoers on the spot. When he discovers that scarred supervillain Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) is responsible for the production of a deadly new narcotic Slo-Mo Dredd tools up and goes hunting. The film has clearly been made on a tighter budget than your average Hollywood shoot-em-up but Travis makes the most of limited resources the industrial backdrops are stunning the action scenes sizzle and the eye-of-the-addict Slo-Mo sequences are sickeningly beautiful. A shame then that the script consistently falls so flat.

Garland Travis and the producers are totally missing the tone of the comics which was very satirical. In addition lets not forget that mega city one was never just as off the rack dystopia as depicted here - this was a place where weather-control meant that it rained when the streets got dirty and the majority of citizens lived in fear of fascistic judges. I think that the big problem may be with Dredd himself - hes not the best character from 2000AD for a big screen adaptation and the helmet costume etc always do look a bit silly in real life - as the hulk movies prove some comics are better left as comics. I understand that Rebellion who own the rights are a bunch of video game boys who have been tied up in legal issues for years and this is why no other 2000AD strips are ever adapted. Its a shame this great piece of British intellectual property cant have better handlers as I for one would love to see Nemesis Slaine or Robohunter on the big screenFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 8 2012MartinTFeaturedThey obviously read the Judge Dredd comics before making the film and the the tough incorruptible humourless hero is well done.

Grim gritty and ultra-violent ""Dredd"" reinstates the somber brutality missing from the U.K. comicbook icons previous screen outing the disappointing 1995 Sylvester Stallone starrer ""Judge Dredd."" A reboot as drastic as Christopher Nolans ""Batman Begins"" this hard-R sci-fi actioner from director Pete Travis and screenwriter Alex Garland should find an appreciative audience among serious-minded fanboys and gorehounds while the pics more extreme elements will likely limit its potential of crossing over to the superhero mainstream when Lionsgate releases it domestically Sept. 21. At a time when most comicbook adaptations try to be all things to all people ""Dredd"" makes the radical choice of playing to the base. Dredd-heads disappointed by the creative liberties and concessions to conventionality made by the Stallone version will find little reason to quibble with the determined and unapologetic approach to the one-man judge jury and executioner here. Theres no comic-relief sidekick no love interest no movie-star pandering. In a direct nod to the source this Dredd never even removes his face-obscuring helmet remaining a stoic and mysterious figure throughout. The action unfolds on a futuristic Earth ravaged by wars and divided into overcrowded urban centers known as Mega-Cities patrolled by Judges members of an all-powerful police force equipped with the latest technology and bestowed with the responsibility of rendering life-or-death verdicts at the scene of a crime. The irreproachable Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) who safeguards Mega-City One is asked to evaluate rookie Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) an Academy underachiever who nevertheless possesses extraordinary psychic abilities She can read minds a rather invaluable trick for solving crimes. When Dredd and Cassandra respond to a triple-homicide call in a high-rise they find themselves battling ruthless drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) a former prostitute who now rules with an iron fist over the 200-story vertical slum. Ma-Ma has evaded capture while supplying Mega-City One with a potent narcotic called Slo-Mo which allows users to experience reality at a fraction of its normal speed -- but shes never faced Judge Dredd. The films unforgiving version of Dredd is something of a cross between Christian Bales Batman and Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name. Hes a badass of few words and a gravelly voice. While Urban isnt permitted to reveal much humanity behind the man (we never even get a peek at Dredds eyes beneath his uniform helmet let alone his soul) he does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront. That leaves Thirlby to shoulder the films emotional core and the physically unassuming actress proves up to the challenge of a meaty role. Cassandra is as committed to taking down criminals as Dredd but she also harbors a deep reserve of empathy that stems from being able to see into other peoples minds. One of the films true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judges merciless duties and a psychics compassionate understanding. Of course ""Dredd"" also serves up thrills far less nuanced than its heroines inner struggles. Relentless carnage bombards the viewer from all sides even more so in impressively utilized 3D. Heads are smashed bullets rip through body parts and one larynx is memorably destroyed accompanied by the throbbing sounds of Paul Leonard-Morgans bass-heavy original score. Even though both the heroes and the villains prove equally barbarous theres never any question as to whos good or bad in this black-and-white world. Its only through Cassandras emotional arc that the audience sees any cracks in the totalitarian justice system. As suggested by the wild shift in quality between his breakout docudrama ""Omagh"" and underwhelming follow-up ""Vantage Point"" director Travis is only as strong as his source material. He gets a sturdy B-movie foundation here from Garland who sets the tone by taking comicbook characters and situations seriously. This earnest approach is evident in tech credits as well most notably Anthony Dod Mantles cinematography which eschews the jittery handheld imagery of Travis earlier films for more careful compositions. The judiciously spread-out ""Slo-Mo"" sequences are especially eye-catching. Editor Mark Eckersley gets a workout in a trippy sequence in which Cassandra enters the mind of a remorseless prisoner (Wood Harris) and production designer Mark Digby relishes the details of establishing a functioning city (including a medical center eateries and even a movie theater) within a massive high-rise.
