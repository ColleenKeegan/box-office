John Godeys grimy dimestore novel was originally adapted for the big screen back in 1974 resulting in a taut thriller notable for inspiring Tarantino to create his colour-coded criminals in Reservoir Dogs. Theres no Mr Blue or Mr Green in Tony Scotts remake - and its hard to imagine it inspiring anyone to do anything.It starts well enough as John Travoltas burly porn-moustachioed ex-con Ryder and his gang of thinly characterised crims take over a New York subway train and hold the passengers at gunpoint. Cue Denzel Washingtons Garber an out-of-his-depth desk jockey with a sketchy moral history and a rapport with the bad guys. Let the verbal sparring commenceThe films mid-section in which these two fine actors chew manfully through Brian Helgelands dialogue despite repeated interruption from James Gandolfinis portly Mayor and Scotts zipline shakycam histrionics just about holds the attention. There are nice turns from John Turturro as a twitchy hostage negotiator and Luis Guzman as a squirrelly crook. But it all collapses in the final act eschewing tension in favour of a series of dimly lit tunnel-bound shootouts. The Taking of Pelham 123 is not a bad film its ponderous and shallow but always watchable. But what it crucially fails to do especially in the light of its illustrious predecessor is justify its own existence.

By Anthony Lane Denzel Washington and John Travolta in Tony Scotts new movie.   Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell A close analysis of the differences between the new Tony Scott movie ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" and the movie of the same name from 1974 can be boiled down to this one film ends with an armed face-off on a bridge with cops running traffic snorting and trains rattling by; the other ends with a sneeze. Can you possibly guess which is which? The basic dough of the plot is unaltered; the changes are all in the frosting. A bunch of crooks led by a loudmouth who calls himself Ryder (John Travolta) take over a New York subway train give the city an hour to come up with a ransom and promise to kill a hostage every minute after that. The hijack itself is nicely under way by the end of the opening credits so no one could accuse the director of hanging back. Indeed for the rest of the film he likes to flash up a number of minutes to warn of the oncoming deadline. In case we dont get it the characters consult their watches too in product-blazoning closeup with Travolta taking especial care to advertise the same brand that he does in magazines. Whether buyers in need of a timepiece will be encouraged to follow the example of a homicidal nihilist only market research will tell. In the earlier version directed by Joseph Sargent the villains nemesis was a transit cop played by Walter Matthau. Here hes a train dispatcher named Garber (Denzel Washington) and the core of the movie lies in his phone negotiations with Ryder a bullish patty-cake with each man trying to outflank the other. ""Keep deflecting"" is the advice that Garber is given in his effort to stall the mayhem. Predictably this soon becomes a straight testosterone contest with none of the surprise of sly-versus-bluff that John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood say brought to their exchanges during ""In the Line of Fire."" Not that the swagger of the camerawork and the editing would allow for the practice of subtlety. If anything you come away with a vague impression of having been cuffed over the ears with a Steadicam. The one exception to this is a ludicrous scene in which Ryder having learned that Garber is not a regular dispatcher--he has been demoted from a senior post on suspicion of taking a bribe--exhorts him on speaker phone to confess his sin. Denzel Washingtons eyes well up and the score devised by Harry Gregson-Williams which begins with wrathful hip-hop slows to a mournful theme whose first four notes echo the leitmotif of ""Parsifal."" Can a director be arrested for the attempted hijack of our emotions? You may be wondering how Ryder got hold of this information. I could explain it just as I could unravel the minor subplot in which one of the hostages maintains an online video feed to his incredibly stupid girlfriend back home. But the truth is that under the mildest inspection every strand of this story--as scripted by Brian Helgeland--frays into absurdity. Do you need to hear about the rat that strays up the pant leg of a police marksman? Or the multiple pileups in the streets? These are caused by the police vehicles racing to bring the bags of ransom money--crashes that could have been avoided as the mayor (James Gandolfini) points out by the use of something called a helicopter. With respect Mr. Mayor you dont understand devastation in the world according to Tony Scott is less a regrettable by-product of events than their raison detre. You get more buck from a bang. What has happened since the tale was first told thirty-five years ago is not that the rules of cinema have been transformed but that ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3.2"" as I like to think of it is a game that declares itself to be a game. There is no pretense that any of the verities whether of incident or of character are in play or that anything of moral weight is at stake; the hostages only a couple of whom are honored with a name seem as disposable to Scott as they are to the nefarious Ryder. As for Garber he may claim to be ""just a guy on the other end of the mike"" but he soon sharpens up from coffee-spilling doofus to gun-toting angel of justice and both Washington and Travolta rather than inhabiting their parts struck me as film stars toying with flashy personae--with a pair of fictional showoffs who might well admit to enjoying their dramatic predicament. Im not sure that any genre of movie least of all the thriller can survive such a blast of self-consciousness. Keep deflecting like this and therell be no more stories to tell. For the second time in a month a redhead saves the day. It happened with ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian"" the new Ben Stiller comedy about waxworks and a host of ancient artifacts being brought back to life. The film dozed along until it was slapped awake by Amy Adams whose bobbed and ballsy turn as Amelia Earhart is the most cheering performance of the year. Now the torch is passed to Patricia Clarkson who just about rescues ""Whatever Works"" the new Woody Allen comedy about a waxwork (an aging New York Jewish intellectual) and a host of ancient artifacts (trio-playing buddies worries about an indifferent cosmos the desires of a compliant younger woman) being brought back to life. It should be called ""Manhattan Battle of the Upper West Side."" Apparently the story was written in the nineteen-seventies. Only now like something out of ""Sleeper"" has it been defrosted. Boris Yellnikoff (Larry David) once a professor of physics has been reduced to teaching chess to kids. He has a limp (the result of a failed suicide attempt) a scuzzy apartment and a firm belief that he was tipped for a Nobel Prize. So he tells us anyhow turning and talking to the camera in the first scene and then throughout the film. This was a beautiful trick when deployed in ""Annie Hall""--in a schoolroom at the movies during lunch with Annies family--but those monologues were cut short as other voices intruded eliding the narcissism of the hero and forcing him to join a crowded world. Boris by contrast is allowed to rant at leisure barely drawing a laugh and we are left with the sense of a locked-in soul--a proud one too as if he alone (plus by implication the director) were witness to an inarguable truth. One night heading home Boris is accosted by a damsel in distress--a teen-age Mississippi runaway named Melody St. Ann Celestine (Evan Rachel Wood). Needless to say she is no junkie or con artist but a cutie-pie in need of consolation who moves in with the old-timer and marries him a low-rent update on the Susan Alexander who was picked up by Charles Foster Kane. I was hoping for an Allen switcheroo of the kind he perfected in ""Bullets Over Broadway"" Melody and Boris would slowly swap philosophical positions with him flipping sunny-side up and her fading into a grouch. It doesnt happen. Instead the plot halts re-starting only when Melodys mother Marietta (Clarkson) raps on the door. One look at Boris resplendent in boxer shorts and robe and she faints. ""Hes not a husband"" she says. ""Hes more of an outpatient."" This is pretty broad stuff but Clarkson is so much more vital and amiable than anyone else that you instantly root for her. I think Allen knows that which is why he loads her with the switch; the tight conscience of the Southern Christian busts right open and Marietta winds up having a show of nude photographs and living in a menage a trois. The trouble is that she cant be allowed to take over the film so Allen bundles her story onto the sidelines and directs our attention instead to the rolling mopes of his alter ego Boris and to Melodys fling with a drippy Brit. His name is Randy (Henry Cavill) and his idea of a come-on is ""I read and I think and I play my flute."" Oh please. You know what you can do with your flute. Somewhere in ""Whatever Works"" is the grit of a great movie. It would be a movie in which Allen interrogates his own nostalgia; in which the Larry David character rather than being handed a free pass would have his fatalism tested by a younger generation--not by Melody whose uneducated blitheness is too cartoonish to present a threat but by a smart male for whom the twitches of neurosis are as fusty as costume drama. Or how about a retread in which Boris picks on someone his own age and finds love with Marietta? In which to his astonishment she balks at the speed of her cultural makeover? There is something both majestic and sad in Allens abiding conviction that anyone from outside the tristate area is either an airhead or a chronic hick and that a dose of Manhattan is the last and best chance for a cure. There was always a dreaminess in his vision of the city but now it feels as distant as the polished floors and the Deco furnishings of the Fred Astaire movies that Boris finds--of course--whenever he turns on the TV. How do you do that Boris? Real people get the shopping channel.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

By Peter Rainer PELHAM_P1 June 12 2009 Save for later Saved John Travolta is shown in a scene from ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" Stephen Vaughn/Sony Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Way back in 1974 when the world was young and New York was mere meadowlands a pretty good thriller called ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" screeched onto the screen. It starred Walter Matthau as a subway dispatcher forced to deal with the hijacker of a subway train played by Robert Shaw just before he made ""Jaws."" The ransom demands were simple One million in cash delivered within the hour or hostages would be offed one per minute.In the remake Denzel Washington is the dispatcher and John Travolta is the bad guy and the ransom is 10 million. That ransom isnt the only sign of inflation. Whereas the original directed by Joseph Sargent was essentially a well-oiled B movie the new incarnation directed by Tony (""Enemy of the State"") Scott is bristling with high-tech gimcrackery and over-the-top camera flourishes. Scott is the kind of director who cant just show you something - he has to pull our eyes out of their sockets. Doesnt he realize that the New York subway netherworld is already a stage set? Scotts whirlybird camera moves and editing rhumbas dont add to the mix they detract.Washingtons Walter Garber toils in the transit systems control headquarters; hes a lifer in the tunnels. Although hes under a cloud for possibly accepting a bribe on the job we are made to understand that hes a decent man. His adversary Travoltas Ryder has a scary black mustache and a neck tattoo. As befitting a villain he also has most of the good lines. (Brian Helgeland wrote the script.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Walter and Ryder via microphone hookup develop a queasy rapport. Head games are played on both sides but the shenanigans are fairly routine. At one point Walter with the off-mic coaching of a hostage negotiator (an excellent John Turturro) cagily elicits the fact that Ryder was raised a Roman Catholic and spent time in prison. That should narrow the list of possible suspects. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 Washington wearing geeky glasses looks rather flabby in the role. (Lets hope the poundage is on purpose.) Although its nice to see him playing an average guy for a change instead of a fire breather its also a disappointment. I didnt feel as if I was getting the whole actor here just a marked-down facsimile. Travolta by contrast overplays as much as Washington underplays. Hes like the meanie in a pulp superhero thriller. This impression is reinforced when Ryder in the films nuttiest set piece sends the train speeding brakeless toward Coney Island. I expected Spider Man to save the day.Ryder might as well be acting alone since his accomplices are barely sketched in. (Did Scott think that Travolta might be upstaged? Fat chance.) James Gandolfini shows up in an amusing cameo as the mayor in a part that seems cobbled together from oddments in the careers of Rudy Giuliani Elliot Spitzer and Donald Trump. At one point the mayor fighting the one-hour deadline complains that the ransom money should have been zipped to Ryder via helicopter instead of through the clogged city streets. We know the answer to that one If a helicopter had been used there would have been no movie.The 1974 ""Pelham"" came out at a time when New York City was a big scary deal onscreen. Films such as ""Serpico"" ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""The French Connection"" really ramped up the urban gothic grunge. In todays benighted world New York is perceived less as the progenitor of plagues and more like their recipient. New York has gone from perpetrator to victim. Back in 1974 the bad guys bubbled up from the bowels of the city. Today they are just one more species of careerist and the city in which they operate is no longer central to our movie nightmares. How can it be? In an out-of-control world there is no such thing as mission control. Grade B- (Rated R for violence and pervasive language.)

"The Taking of Pelham 123 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW The Taking of Pelham 123Director Tony Scott crisply pieces together the hostage drama. John Travolta and Denzel Washington star.June 12 2009|Kenneth Turan | FILM CRITIC Tony Scott is a director who makes the trains run on time. Not just the specific subway cars of his efficient thriller ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" but the metaphorical trains of action movie pyrotechnics in general.Though hes worked somewhat in the shadow of his more thematically adventurous brother Ridley Scott has earned his Hollywood reputation as a shooter someone who knows how to make things move like lightning on screen.Collaborating here with stars Denzel Washington and John Travolta Scott puts those talents to use in this crisp effective New York subway hostage drama. Its not the kind of film that dominates at the Oscars but ""Pelham"" is so professionally done you rarely have the luxury of taking your eyes off the screen.From ""Pelhams"" opening credits to its conclusion you can feel Scotts small-boy excitement (aided by Chris Lebenzons skilled editing and Harry Gregson-Williams score) at making things pop off the screen. No one takes more pleasure in the vivid display of squad cars and their squealing tires or the purposeful careening of police motorcycles.Because he is a shooter first and foremost Scott is often only as good as his scripts and his best films -- ""Crimson Tide"" ""Enemy of the State"" ""Man on Fire"" -- tend to be the ones that are based on the best-written material.So its not an accident that ""Pelham"" has good things going for it in that department. The original source John Godeys 1973 novel was the basis of an excellent film starring Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw.And current screenwriter Brian Helgeland who wrote Scotts ""Man on Fire"" counts both ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mystic River"" among his credits.The fact that this is a hostage drama makes ""Pelham"" stand apart from most of Scotts work with its reliance on tension created by words specifically the back and forth of ransom negotiations.So its fortunate that the film has stars with the ability to hold our attention even though they are almost never in the same physical space (and in fact didnt even meet in the studio until the seventh week of shooting).Its Travoltas Ryder we encounter first looking malevolent as all get-out as he glides down the streets of New York sporting a Fu Manchu mustache dark sunglasses a wool cap pulled low on his head and a prison tattoo on his neck. ""Hairsprays"" Edna Turnblad this is not.Ryder and his team of miscreants are headed for a rendezvous at a train on the Lexington Avenue line the Pelham 123 to be specific filled with ordinary New Yorkers who have no idea they are on the way to subway hell.Ryders opposite number looking as menacing as a grilled cheese sandwich is soft and paunchy subway dispatcher Walter Garber played by Washington as the kind of guy who wears a bib napkin while eating lunch at his desk.This type of hesitant role is a change for Washington but as an actor who drips charisma just sitting in a chair he is well within his comfort zone.While Garber is busy spilling coffee on himself Ryder and his gang are commandeering that subway car and its 19 hostages and calling in their ransom demand 10 million (up from the 1 million in the 1974 film) to be delivered within an hour or else people are going to die.Its pure happenstance that Garber gets the call but Ryder with that quirkiness common to movie psychopaths takes a shine to the guy and refuses to share his deep thoughts like ""we all owe God a death"" with anyone else.Ryder wont talk to ace NYPD hostage negotiator Vincent Camonetti (John Turturro); hell barely talk to the mayor (an excellent James Gandolfini). Its Garber or nobody and so the dance between unexpected antagonists begins.The third star of ""Pelham"" is the venerable New York City subway system. Anchored by strong work by cinematographer Tobias Schliessler the crew filmed on the subway for four weeks the most extensive shoot there ever and the result is formidably convincing.It almost goes without saying that ""Pelham"" has its problems including some clunky plot elements and a phenomenal amount of coincidence. But faced with these difficulties the film does what a good hostage negotiator does It distracts us from whats going wrong and pulls us into the story.

""The Taking of Pelham 123"" Movie Review -- Want a gritty hold-on-to-your-seat ride? ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" has pulled into the station. And for admirers of swift stylish thrillers its just in time. Smart genre fans havent been given many choices lately. Sci-fi buffs at least had ""Star Trek."" Animation geeks had ""Up."" Dirty-joke comedy lovers got ""The Hangover."" But fans of tight little cat-and-mouse thrillers? They were still standing on the platform looking expectantly down the tunnel for their one decent film to arrive. The Taking of Pelham 123 (R) Columbia Pictures (121 min.) Directed by Tony Scott. With Denzel Washington John Travolta. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating THREE STARS Rating note The film contains violence and very strong language. But now comes ""Pelham 123."" Its hardly Hitchcock but it is a very welcome sight. Older fans may fondly recall the 1974 hit ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" which featured Robert Shaw Walter Matthau and a hijacked subway with the kidnappers demanding the very-Dr.-Evil payday of ""one million dollars"" The new version updates all that. Now John Travolta is the madman whos seized the Lexington Avenue local; Denzel Washington is the average-Joe subway dispatcher with whom he negotiates. And the payday has been upped too although its a while before we realize just how much. The director of the original ""Pelham"" was the unremarkable TV hack Joseph Sargent; this time its the flashy movie veteran Tony Scott. Once again unfortunately he has more style than substance. Although Tony has big-brother Ridleys eye for visuals he doesnt share his interest in complicated characters and breathless pauses an impatience hes demonstrated in films from ""Top Gun"" to ""Deja Vu."" Luckily though he has two strong actors here. First is Travolta who has been getting daring in middle age. In ""Hairspray"" he put on a fat suit and a housedress; here he parades around like some old Christopher Street pinup complete with Village People mustache. He also of course plays a villain something he does well (see ""Face/Off"" -- no really see it now) but not nearly often enough. Second is Denzel Washington who dares something else here -- going gray and slightly paunchy to play as he constantly repeats ""just a guy"" -- a normal MTA bureaucrat who happens to pick up the phone the day that Travolta and maybe destiny calls. Foregoing the scenery his co-star gets to chew its a solid selfless turn. Apart from the action sequences -- all typically well-staged by Scott if a little over-decorated with blurry images and frantic editing -- the film does other smart things. One is making Washingtons hero a flawed character -- like Mel Gibson in ""Ransom"" this fellow has some ugliness in his past. Another is a clever visual twinning of the two leads -- giving them both single earrings for example and similar beards -- that while avoiding the facile ""You and me were not that different"" trope still suggests a bond. Not all of the movie is quite as subtle and the silliness accelerates the closer we get to the final stop. Travoltas plan seems clever only if you dont think about it too much. A clumsy bit of trendy updating -- putting a blogger on the train -- amounts to nothing. And the climactic chase scene isnt in keeping with Washingtons character and seems solely the product of modern Hollywood convention (the low-key climax of the original was better). But at this point in the summer -- which by Hollywood yardsticks is nearly half over -- thats okay. Weve been waiting too long for a sharp little urban thriller with a couple of tense scenes and one fine bold performance. Given the time well grab this express train happily.

The Taking of Pelham 123 Add to ... Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 11 2009 433PM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jun. 17 2009 548PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Taking of Pelham 123 Directed by Tony Scott Written by Brian Helgeland Starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta Classification 14A The crime the squalor the political corruption the boiling ethnic melting pot No wonder New York was such a great place for movies in the seventies. Though Joseph Sargents 1974 thriller The Taking of Pelham One Two Three  was not of the quality of Serpico or Taxi Driver  it holds up as a flavourful punchy thriller. John Godeys novel about four gunmen who seize a subway cars passengers for ransom was the basis of a blackly comic portrait of early seventies New York as a bad-tempered mess of a city. The joke is that survival skills are so well-honed even a lowly transit official (Walter Matthau) can outwit an icy British criminal mastermind played by Robert Shaw. In Reservoir Dogs  Quentin Tarantino paid homage to Pelham s device of hijackers who refer to each other with colour-coded aliases (Mr. Brown Mr. Grey Mr. Blue and Mr. Green). The film was also remade as a 1998 television movie with Vincent DOnofrio and Edward James Olmos. The new version directed by Tony Scott and written by Brian Helgeland ( L.A. Confidential ) tries to update the social milieu with references to post-9/11 fears Iraq War vets and swindling Wall Street high rollers. James Gandolfini for instance offers a witty turn as an independent mayor with embarrassing divorce problems conflating Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. But its a struggle. From the seventies to the naughts downtown New York suffered a loss of civic personality as its image changed from working-class funk to one of corporate professionalism. The new movie appropriately is an efficiently engineered piece of studio product enjoyable enough at times but with an unmistakable assembly-line quality. Manhattan is less of a character here than a backdrop for director Tony Scotts whirling camera work and stuttering montage sequences. In thrillers such as Enemy of the State and Deja Vu  Scotts image bombardment suited the atmosphere of high-tech paranoia. Here his busy dice-and-spin style often feels superfluous to whats essentially a dramatic dialogue between two men in confined spaces the hostage-taker in a subway car and a negotiator at the control centre. Theyre played by Denzel Washington and John Travolta and the most entertaining aspect of the new movie is the way the two actors bear down into character parts and engage in a rattling back-and-forth exchange. In the earlier film Walter Matthau played the hostage-negotiating transit cop as a gregarious grump more or less the embodiment of working-class New York. Matthaus first name Walter has been appropriated for Washingtons character Walter Garber but not much else remains. Washingtons character is a working-class Joe who rose through the ranks until he reached executive level - before screwing up. Now hes busted down to lowly dispatcher pending an investigation. He has the bad luck to pick up a call from Ryder (John Travolta) and is reluctantly thrown into the role of the citys negotiator. Washington is bespectacled and carrying extra weight in his cheeks and around his belly a physical manifestation of his middle-aged resignation. During most of the movie he is forced to endure the insults and condescension of everyone around him from his hostile supervisor to a suspicious New York cop (John Turturro) who thinks Walter might be in on the heist. When Ryder on the other end of the radio learns that hes dealing with a fellow bad apple he almost shrieks with glee and insists that Garber is his point man for the negotiations and money delivery. With his seventies porn-star Fu Manchu mustache and greased back hair Travolta looks as though he stepped out of the original movie. Initially his performance feels over the top but it modulates as the movie progresses. Unlike Shaws ice-veined manipulator Ryders a volatile braggart who plays head games and makes capricious violent decisions. There is talk of his Catholic fatalism (as if screenwriter Helgeland reference-checked themes of seventies New York movies) which is more about adding surface shading than actual depth before his characters background is gradually revealed. Given the movies sense of calculation the moments where it comes up short are hard to understand. A teenagers laptop sends images of the robbers out on the Internet but the subplot does little except add a new grainy camera texture for Scotts palette. Ryders fellow hijackers are underdeveloped leaving Luis Guzman as the former subway motorman utterly anonymous under his disguise. Most disappointing is the new films reluctance to even attempt to match the ingenuity of the original movies celebrated one-two punch ending. The best thing the new Pelham can offer in compensation is a spinning panorama of midtown gridlock and a glance at an iconic yellow cab with the tourist board ""Made in New York"" motto on its rooftop sign. ""Manufactured in New York"" would be more like it. Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 Suspense drama. Starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Directed by Tony Scott. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Every movie involves two realities the one onscreen and the one in the theater and the interplay between the two is sometimes dynamic. ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" has all the usual virtues of a good action suspense drama but it lacks that extra something - that context that vital interchange - that made the original ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" such a memorable experience in 1974. So an evil mastermind decides to hijack a subway train and hold up the city of New York for an enormous ransom. Today we watch and think sure that could happen. There are bad people in the world and anybody could become the victim of some random senseless act of violence. But in 1974 this premise was received in a much different way not as an outlandish scenario that could happen but as a variety of madness that probably would happen sooner or later because everything was falling apart. You know the litany Vietnam. Then Watergate. New York City was going broke. Just getting into a subway car was dangerous even without kidnappers or hostage takers. Back then civilization seemed to be heading off a cliff and New York always on the cutting edge of fashion looked destined to hit bottom first. Thus ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" was more than a suspense drama in 1974; it was a vision of urban apocalypse.

Photo Stephen Vaughn Columbia Pictures Review The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Today we have our own visions of the apocalypse - terrorism civic catastrophe economic collapse - and this new ""Pelham"" might have gotten some extra juice had it tapped into those. But the remake eschews the social context that made the original so compelling. Instead of a terrorist for a villain or someone equally mysterious the movie gives us a lone nut and his small band of thugs. (""Pelham"" even guesses wrong When a character tries to manipulate the stock market we look at his laptop to find the Dow Jones at 12000. It cant be scary if our own apocalypse is bigger than their apocalypse.) Still despite some odd choices on the part of the filmmakers this remake works out better than one might expect. For example picture John Travolta playing a mentally unbalanced emotionally erratic homicidal maniac. Then go to ""Pelham"" and be surprised. Travolta does not go into his charming bag of tricks. He doesnt smile or laugh (or even scowl like the guy in ""Pulp Fiction""). In fact on three occasions I had to remind myself that this was Travolta. He takes a baseline pretty-good movie and through sheer conviction makes it a little better than that. So does Denzel Washington. He plays the transit officer manning the controls for that sector of the New York subway system whos the first to make contact with the hijacker (Travolta). Washington lends the character a specifically New York type of working mans diffidence - hes a regular guy way over his head forced to improvise - and we watch him grow not in confidence but in moral authority. This is strong convincing character work. Credit some of that to Tony Scott. Hes a director known for his bombast and rightly so but unlike the overbearing generation of Tony Scott imitators that have taken root in the past 20 years this director never forgets the human element. He grounds his action in personality and builds action sequences skillfully without relying on that shaking-the-camera idiocy that wrecks half the action movies we see each year. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland had the concept to turn ""Pelham"" into an elaborate two-person dance between the hijacker and the transit worker with the idea being that these guys despite their differences arent so far apart. Helgelands idea of hero and villain both inhabiting a moral gray area seems like a relic from the relativist 1990s and isnt an ideal match for this material. Yet theres no denying that this is a good writer working with a good director and two inspired charismatic actors and together they come up with something interesting and compelling on its own terms. ""Pelham"" might even be cause for enthusiasm if there werent a better movie with that exact same title already available everywhere. -- AdvisoryStrong language and very harsh nasty violence.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Denzel Washington is no Walter Matthau. John Travolta is no Robert Shaw. And the remake of ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" is all the better for these so-obvious facts. Kinetic director Tony Scott balances his need for speed and flash with fleshed-out drama making ""Pelham"" the best of his recent outings. The hyper gives way to the emotionally hushed then revs back up. In the nerve center of New York City Transit temporary dispatcher Walter Garber (Washington) catches a communication he wishes he hadnt. The subway train of the title has been seized. Passengers are being held for ransom. The guy in charge goes by the name Ryder (Travolta). With a tattoo inking his neck a knit cap pulled down low Travoltas character wears the look of a man whos spent time with urban gangstas. Sounds like it too. Then again he also talks the talk of a different street -- Wall Street. Figuring out who Ryder is why hes doing what hes doing and what feeds his style of malice pulls us hard into the story. His demands seem calculated for maximum discomfort on the part of the city. If he and his gun-toting accomplices dont get the money in the scant time allotted hell begin killing. James Gandolfini plays the dyspeptic mayor whos got troubles of his own. Da Mayors no Tony Soprano. Brian Helgelands adaptation of John Godeys 1973 novel transforms a heist drama into a dynamic psychological face-off between Travolatas borderline sociopath and Washingtons decent guy. Its a nimble tango of wills thats surprisingly moving at times. ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" is cast with a number of strong character players. John Turturro does agile work as the smart but suspicious hostage negotiator who coaches and challenges Washingtons Garber. Luis Guzman is Ramos the nervous motorman on Ryders crew. Michael Rispoli plays Garbers nemesis at the transit authority. They arent the main event but add to the weave of Helgelands deft storytelling. The language of the book was raw. The 1974 big-screen version was a little mean a little wry very gritty. The dialogue of the movie was the stuff of racial antagonism. In that versions nod to the bitter divides of the period Shaws mastermind character had been a British mercenary in Africa. In another sign of the eras xenophobia Matthaus transit policeman is grumpily showing a group of Tokyo subway honchos around when the hijacking occurs. Joseph Sargents 1974 movie has been cited in ways that put a lock on its cult status. Like the ""Pelham"" band of hijackers the criminals in Quentin Tarantinos ""Reservoir Dogs"" used colors as their monikers. But ""Pelham"" was not the best of its class of amazingly raw 70s flicks not by a long shot. (And director Scott gives a nod to the far superior ""The French Connection"" in a chase scene in the new version.) Still the original was sociologically telling. New York City circa 1974 was a distressed dangerous place. The famous Daily News headline ""Ford to City Drop Dead"" ran in 1975 prompted by the citys persistent financial woes. And Scotts visceral ride is telling of our moment. This color-saturated energetic blitz shot with multiple cameras captures -- and subtly celebrates -- a post- 9/11 New York City. This is not a city on the verge of bankruptcy (though finance has its place in the tale) fractured by ethnic suspicion and contempt. Instead a scene between hostages turns a misunderstanding into empathy. Its a potent vision of the things we share not those that separate us. Still the big show remains the mind-game match-up between Ryder and Garber and the actors who portray them. Its a tense rivalry of vastly different forces and -- as it should be when two actors dig into the muck and grit of their characters wells -- its a pleasure to watch.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 12 2009 The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (out of 4)Starring Denzel Washington John Travolta John Turturro and James Gandolfini. Directed by Tony Scott. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Complex times called for complex responses. Its a simple philosophy that keeps this remake of the 1974 subway hijack thriller The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 firmly on the rails.Against all odds and better advice director Tony Scott screenwriter Brian Helgeland and main protagonists Denzel Washington and John Travolta take a much-loved genre classic - it inspired Quentin Tarantino - and arguably make it better.Pelham 74 was very much of its time. With New York risking bankruptcy and street crime spiralling the screen adaptation of John Godeys bestselling novel played almost as dark satire finding humour in the hackneyed view of New Yorkers as gruff cynics who smirk at danger. Walter Matthaus transit cop Lt. Garber squared off against Robert Shaws ruthless kidnapper Blue in a wily contest of wills.Pelham 09 similarly finds its groove in the here and now with more complications and fewer laughs for the 21st century world of moral ambiquity.The film realistically adds fears of terrorism to the mix and shades characters so that both Garber (Washington) and renamed kidnapper Ryder (Travolta) have intriguing back stories plausibly connecting them as kindred spirits in desperation.Helgelands sturdy script adds a new figure to the drama a hostage negotiator well played by John Turturro. At the same time theres an upgrade for the NYC mayor the simpering buffoon of 74 becomes the manoeuvring politician of 09 with James Gandolfini stealing every scene hes in.The updated screenplay which follows much the same clock-ticking trajectory as before still finds time as in the original to explain the titles ""123"" reference which is the 123 p.m. hour that the downtown train begins its journey beneath Manhattan streets. The train doesnt get far before the heavyset Ryder and several accomplices hijack the vehicle using a disgruntled former transit driver (Luis Guzman) to take the wheel and to separate the lead car carrying 18 unsuspecting passengers for the desperados own private run.At the transit command centre subway veteran Garber is manning the electronic tracking board for NYCs Metropolitan Transit Authority. He knows all the blinking lights and coloured digits by heart - were made aware that hes recently been demoted - and he quickly clues in to trouble on the Pelham run. A demand crackles over the intercom. Ryder wants an inflation-adjusted 10 million from the coffers of NYC (""the biggest rathole in the world"") within one hour or hell begin killing one hostage for every minute of delay. Ryder is considerably more garrulous than Shaws Blue who considered silence a virtue. Ryder warms to Garber and cleverly outs his compromised situation a former transit manager now riding a desk in transit control. Ryder forces a confession that ups the stakes in the drama. Travolta clearly relishes the chance to play a really bad guy and almost makes us forget Shaws perfectly conceived character.Washington meanwhile successfully downshifts to a more layered but less forceful figure than Matthaus caustic cop insisting ""Im just a guy on the other end of the mic.""Drama insists it wont stay that way and the picture falters a bit only in the third act when Scotts need for speed and the desire for a big emotional ending force the situation into the realm of the ridiculous. The finale of Pelham 74 was similarly dubious.Scott and Helgeland are cinematic dice players either rolling high with the likes of Top Gun (Scott) and Mystic River (Helgeland) or coming up snake eyes with Domino (Scott) and The Postman (Helgeland). Theyre on a hot streak with this one and they deserve extra kudos for recognizing that cellphones and the Internet are part of the world of 2009 but theyre not the entire world.There are still a few tricks to be learned from the past and Pelham 09 makes an appropriate station stop on the original line while heading in a satisfying new direction.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The documentary film was written and directed by Clay Tweel. Photo Open Road Films By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 30 2016 155 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS The subject of Clay Tweels superb documentary feature is Steve Gleason the former New Orleans Saints safety who was diagnosed with ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease in 2011. Shortly afterward Mr. Gleason started chronicling the progress of his disease in a video diary but six weeks later he and his wife Michel learned she was pregnant. At that point the diary became for the most part a series of straight-to-the-camera messages to his son Rivers both before and after the birth. ""My intention"" he says at the outset when his speech is still unimpaired ""is to pass on as much of who I am as I possibly can to you."" What was meant as a gift to his son is a gift to anyone who watches the film which incorporates Mr. Gleasons home videos in a profile of almost unfathomable courage--hes still very much with us although his body has been ravaged by the disease--and a portrait of a profoundly good man. ENLARGE Michel Gleason Steve Gleason and Rivers Gleason. Photo Open Road Films ""Gleason"" is so powerful in its cumulative effect that it should be accompanied by a consumer advisory--something along the lines of ""This documentary may cause sudden alterations of mood and attitude."" I can attest to having been undone by at least one scene and Im far from an easy weeper; its a confrontation between Mr. Gleason and his own father a man with rigid notions of good and evil. The moment is at once heart-rending and transcendently beautiful and father-and-son themes play in parallel throughout the film or perhaps they intertwine in a double helix. Mr. Gleason is determined to be a better father for his son than his father was for him even though he must speak through a voice synthesizer by the time Rivers is starting to talk. More Reviews Jason Bourne Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The film is authentically inspiring but also unsparing in its depiction of the horrors of ALS and its impact on the family. (The implacable strength of Michel Gleason could be the subject of a separate film.) The disease moves swiftly attacking Steve Gleasons spirit as well as his body. There are times captured by the unblinking camera when his agonies seem unendurable yet he has rejected assisted suicide and chosen to live out a life that brings joy with the pain. In one conjunction of more emotions than can be put into words we see him struggling to breathe while he watches Rivers struggling to blow out all four candles on his birthday cake.

Video by Columbia Pictures>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Philip Kennicott Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 12 2009 If you live in a dense and complicated city you can see despair at the bottom of your orange juice glass. How many farmers truckers and shopkeepers does it take to get that juice on your breakfast table? What would happen if the diesel guy the road crew the toll taker or the fruit picker slept through the alarm clock? Cities intensify our wonder and terror at the complexity and seeming frailty of human society. If you tugged at just one little thread would the whole thing unravel? This StoryMovies DerailedThe Taking of Pelham 1 2 3Find Pelham Showtimes TicketsSummer Movie GuideDiscuss Predict the Weekend Box Office WinnerView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" a remake of the gritty and darkly comic 1974 film starring Walter Matthau is about the controlled chaos of New York a city that barely works. At its best when the dialogue is sharp and captures the everyones-a-comedian banter of the Big Apple at its lippiest the film shows how the New York Show still goes on the air every morning despite itself. Play your role defend your turf pay no mind to those other 8 million actors and somehow it all works. The new film directed by Tony Scott (""Enemy of the State"" ""Days of Thunder"" ""Top Gun"") captures some of the grand venality of New York that made the original so much fun. As the lead hijacker of a No. 6 subway train that left the Pelham station at 123 p.m. John Travolta is in high manic mode seething and unpredictable violent and charismatic. The best moments of this film are his conversations with Denzel Washington who plays the Matthau role but with an important difference The original character was a transit police lieutenant whereas Washington plays a disgraced subway official and former dispatcher who is accidentally thrust into a leading role when a train stops where it shouldnt. If the film stayed there -- if it focused on the psychology of an ordinary guy with a blot on his record and a crazy man who sees his own darkness in everyone he meets -- it might be a good film. But this is a Tony Scott film which means it is animated by a restless absurd need for excess for energy and speed and rapid manic dizzying camera work. And it has the usual Tony Scott tics the misogyny and male solipsism. Women are reduced to bit players passive needy intrusions on the world of male jousting annoying chicks who demand professions of love even as the world is going up in smoke. In interviews Scott has said he was intrigued by the films challenges Why would someone hijack a subway train? Isnt that a little unlikely? Isnt it rather foolish to commit a crime in a tunnel where you can be easily cornered contained and captured? But alas rather than solve these problems Scott has played whack-a-mole with verisimilitude addressing one implausibility only to find a dozen others emerge with even more absurd implications. Hijacking a subway train may not seem very lucrative so the new film introduces a subplot about gaming the financial markets. And while a subway tunnel may be a rather vulnerable spot to stage a spectacular crime in Scotts version the crooks rig up a WiFi system that gives them a window on the world. And maybe it was a little peculiar that in the original the film ended with the schlumpy Matthau hunting down the last hijacker with low-key old-fashioned gumshoe work. After the high energy of twists and turns of a galvanizing crime it was almost anticlimactic. In Scotts version we have a car chase with helicopters crazy traffic jams and an army of cops on the loose. And Walter Garber Washingtons character is both less and more than what he was in 1974 which makes his trajectory over the course of the film -- from guy in suit to guy with gun from ordinary Joe to action hero -- more dramatic and more ridiculous. The best analogy for this comes from the world of opera where in the 18th and 19th centuries stars wielded so much clout that they inevitably warped the drama with demands for extravagant arias. The action sequence -- in this case Washington hurtling through New York in an SUV -- is the equivalent of that showpiece a set formulaic but obligatory display of narcissism. Washington is a better actor than that. He should learn to say no. But who says no to Tony Scott? Not even Tony Scott can say no to Tony Scott and alas the film devolves into self-indulgent silliness a toxic cocktail of adrenaline and sentiment. You end up asking yourself How do the few genuinely fun bits of this movie -- James Gandolfini plays the mayor with a mix of Michael Bloombergs money and brains and Rudy Giulianis ego and libido -- manage to survive in the midst of so much lousy filmmaking? The answer is a bit like the city itself If a few decent actors play their roles and defend their turf it doesnt matter how preposterous the whole proposition is. The show will go on. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (106 minutes at area theaters) is rated for R for violence and pervasive language. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Derailed Find Pelham Showtimes Tickets Summer Movie Guide The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 Discuss Predict the Weekend Box Office Winner",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/11/AR2009061104198.html,200,thetakingofpelham12316,thetakingofpelham123,washingtonpost

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Taking of Pelham 1 2 3    (out of four) Stars Denzel Washington John Travolta John Turturro James Gandolfini Luis GuzmanDirectorTony ScottDistributor Columbia PicturesRating R for violence and pervasive languageRunning time 1 hour 46 minutes|Opens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Too often remakes of classic films are a wasted exercise. Happily The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 a loose reworking of the 1974 cult classic benefits from a fresh makeover. Though the original movie based on the novel by John Godey had an undeniable sense of suspense and some strong performances it feels dated. In this retelling director Tony Scott uses quick panning shots to intensify the action scenes -- particularly car chases and subway trains careening out of control. And Brian Helgelands script gives the characters more depth and dimension. Denzel Washington plays Walter Garber a Transit Authority official who is demoted to dispatcher after being accused of taking bribes. He is on duty when a New York City subway train is hijacked. His is the role originated by Walter Matthau and while he doesnt have as many clever one-liners Garber has an intriguing back story that Matthaus dispatcher lacked. Ryder the lead hijacker (played by a manic goateed John Travolta) demands 10 million from city coffers in exchange for the release of 18 subway passengers. The rate of inflation is reflected in the new version In 1974 Ryder and his criminal gang demanded 1 million. Here he has concocted a complex stock scheme through which he stands to gain hundreds of millions. Ryder is in cahoots with Phil Ramos (Luis Guzman) a former train operator and two other faceless henchmen. Unlike the original the villains dont wear hats tweed jackets and fake mustaches. Todays on-screen baddies dont have that kind of civility. Instead they have impressive if generic muscled and tattooed physiques and similar glowering expressions. Gone are the almost quaint handguns the hijackers brandished in the 70s. Now theyre heavily armed with semi-automatic weapons and theyre itching to fire. Washington is excellent as Garber John Turturro is top-notch as an NYPD hostage negotiator and James Gandolfini segues believably from his Sopranos Jersey mobster to New York City mayor. Pelham plays out as a taut and well-paced thriller until the final act which grows increasingly implausible. Familiarity with the 70s version is not a prerequisite for enjoyment The new Pelham takes the chilling original premise and modifies it for an era steeped in technology making for an energetic and engrossing adaptation.

Try a remake of The Taking of Pelham 123 the 1974 hostage drama in which a band of bad guys with funny mustaches take control of a subway car terrorizing its passengers and giving the city a mere 60 minutes to deliver a ransom. Or else the good citizens on board start dying.And Walter a Transit Authority veteran working the controls has the fate of this new batch of passengers in his hands.Directed by Tony Scott with a whoosh here a Google Earth shot there lots of backspinning visuals to go with Jay-Zs hip-hop on the sound track The Taking of Pelham 123 pits Washingtons mild-mannered Walter against the hijacking mastermind played by John Travolta. With a tattoo on his neck and villainy in his eye Travolta is Ryder (not his real name) - his backstory a mystery but his intentions clear. Thatll be 10 million delivered pronto please or he and his crew (Luis GuzmA!n Victor Gojcaj) will begin picking off the moms and kids college students and suits Army vets and homeless ladies who are quaking in the car.For most of the movie Washington and Travolta converse by phone. But a face-to-face for the two A-listers seems inevitable. And it is.The original Pelham released when New York was a symbol of insolvency incompetence urban crime and grime doesnt hold up The racism and sexism displayed by Walter Matthau (the hero) and his cohorts spreads through the narrative like an infectious disease. Robert Shaw is the stony ringleader and the suspense mounts accordingly but the film feels flimsy and terribly dated now.Scott with his ADD-directing style and a screenplay (by L.A. Confidentials Brian Helgeland) that layers on a few twists has delivered a film that at least feels of the moment. The character sketches are more sophisticated (but still sketches) the machinations of New Yorks mayoral office (James Gandolfini is His Honor) less cartoonishly cynical and inept. But Ill wager that in another 35 years Scotts version will seem just as awkward and antiquated. The style will be outdated and theres not much substance going on underneath.Washington offers another of his rock-steady performances playing a career civil servant with a couple of secrets of his own but confident diligent ready to go the distance for the city he loves.Travoltas snake-eyed Ryder seethes with menace. Hes smart sinister not to be provoked. But as Ryders motives begin to reveal themselves The Taking of Pelham 123 loses its aura of post-9/11 dread replaced by a muddled commentary on Wall Street greed in these days of raging financial crises.Folks familiar with New York geography are going to question the necessity of Walters third-act helicopter ride (in the company of NYPD hostage negotiator John Turturro) but cinematically it gives Scott the excuse for an appreciative flyover of the skyscrapers and bridges. If only the folks down there knew what a terrible mess has been going on in the tunnels below.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Taking of Pelham 123 The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; taking-of-pelham-123-the ) Taking of Pelham 123 The (United States 2009) June 11 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Hollywood remake train continues unabated racing through signals as it dives underground into New York Citys subways. At least it can be said that this the third version of The Taking of Pelham 123 (following the 1974 feature and a 1998 made-for-TV movie) accomplishes the aim of a good remake remaining faithful to the spirit of the source while offering a fresh perspective on the material. To his credit director Tony Scott (working with a script by Brian Helgeland) does not attempt to transform the story which is essentially a psychological thriller into an action film. The movie is light on pyrotechnics and special effects and except for a preposterous climax surprisingly low-key. The production at least until it deviates from the previously established template and turns ridiculous is gripping and compelling and doesnt make us wish we had checked our brains at the theater entrance. The Taking of Pelham 123 dispenses with anything resembling setup. By the time the opening credits have finished the sociopath who calls himself Ryder (John Travolta) aided by his gang of three (Luis GuzmA!n Victor Gojcaj Robert Vataj) has taken over subway train Pelham 123 and is holding 18 passengers and the conductor hostage. It doesnt take him long to make his demands known; these are delivered to the dispatcher unlucky enough to be on duty Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) who is facing suspension for suspicion of taking a bribe. Ryders requirements are succinct he wants 10 million in 60 minutes or hell start killing the hostages one-by-one. No delays. No tricks. When hostage negotiator Camonetti (John Turturro) tries to take over for Walter Ryder reacts violently. Meanwhile the Mayor (James Gandolfini) nearing the end of his term and relishing the coming nirvana of retirement inserts himself into the growing mess of negotiating with Ryder. This version of The Taking of Pelham 123 is more about the relationship that develops between Ryder and Walter. Unlike in the 1974 movie in which Walter Matthau played the negotiator Walter is not a cop and there is a stain on his record. Travotas Ryder is more of a manipulator than Robert Shaws Mr. Blue. These two fence with each other and try to get into each others minds. Gone from the film are indications of disharmony within the criminal gang. Ryders background is sketched out but the line drawing is never completed. A few domestic scenes of Walter speaking to his wife on the phone enhance his ordinariness and humanity. Ultimately The Taking of Pelham 123 is intended to highlight how a normal person working a 9-to-5 job can be placed in a position where he has the chance to do something heroic. With James Gandolfini playing the Mayor the Abe Beame-inspired caricature has been replaced by someone more forceful and proactive. Turturros character a professional hostage negotiator is added to heighten the drama within the control room. Initially antagonistic toward Walter especially once he learns about the bribery allegation Camonetti eventually ends up in lock-step with him. Friction between Walter and his boss (played by Michael Rispoli who like Gandolfini is a Sopranos alum) adds another layer of tension. Its interesting to note that in the 1974 picture the conflict was aboard the train as Blue fought to control his small band of thugs. In 2009 its in the control room. One small annoyance to be found in The Taking of Pelham 123 is Scotts characteristic ""artistic"" amping up of certain camera shots blurs slow-motion swish-pans etc. These are more distracting than effective calling attention to the directors too-obvious attempts to insert calling cards into the proceedings. Thankfully their use is limited (at least in comparison with some of Scotts previous films). More damaging is the re-worked climax which not only deviates from the simple effective endgame of the 1974 film but does so with the most trite of clichA(c)s the chase scene. As Walter the aging overweight family man with financial troubles Denzel Washington displays his chameleon-like ability to become whatever the director wants. Gone is the forceful presence we normally associate with the actor - Walter needs to crave anonymity at least at the beginning. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about the ending is that were no longer watching Walter; were seeing Denzel Washington action hero. Meanwhile John Travolta is playing a version of the villain he has honed over the year. More often than not Travolta gravitates toward heroic characters but Ryder fits nicely into the stable of creeps and psychopaths that dot Travoltas resume. He looks menacing and thats half the battle. Those familiar with one of the earlier versions of The Taking of Pelham 123 will find that the tune is familiar but many of the beats are different. It is remarkable how with all of the advances in technology over the years a story like this can remain largely unchanged despite a 35 year gap between tellings. By allowing the movie to unfold in real time Scott enhances the level of suspense but the masterstroke that differentiates this The Taking of Pelham 123 from its predecessors is the decision to transform the interaction between Walter and Ryder from a hostage negotiation to a chess game. And although the checkmate is predictable the moves that get the game to that point are not.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Internet buzz pre-slimed this New York subway-hijack thriller as a douched-up reboot of the 1974 original. Since I revere the first movie especially the hangdog genius of Walter Matthau as transit cop Zachary Garber I sympathized. Then I saw The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 and the sucker grabbed me from the minute Denzel Washington basically in the Matthau role came on as train dispatcher Walter Garber. Thats right Walter One hell of a classy name-check if you ask me. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> And thats it for comparisons. The new post-9/11 Pelham packs its own heat. This movie hits you like 600 volts from a sparking third rail. Damn straight its electrifying. Director Tony Scott (bravo True Romance and Crimson Tide boo Domino) keeps the suspense on high sizzle. And screenwriter Brian Helgeland (bravo L.A. Confidential and Mystic River boo The Postman) doing a freestyle adaptation of John Godeys novel takes the time to anchor the thrills to character. Plot? A subway train leaves the Pelham Bay Park terminal in the Bronx at 123 p.m. (ah title mystery solved). At Grand Central Station John Travolta -- rockin a handlebar and a neck tattoo -- jabs a gun through the motormans window and seizes the train and its passengers. His henchman Ramos (the great Luis Guzman) takes the wheel. At 213 p.m. Ryder -- thats Travoltas fake name -- phones Garber at the subway control center and says hell start shooting passengers in 59 minutes unless. . . . Thats the setup. Want to know more like how these bastards intend to escape what is surely an underground trap? See the movie. What counts is how Scott keeps you sweating it out. Travolta and Washington are dynamite in roles that could have slid by as stereotypes. Ryder a former Wall Street player who once globeAtrotted with an ass model is pumped for vengeance against the city for making him do time for embezzlement. Family man Garber also knows how it feels to be squeezed. Hes facing bribery charges. Forget hero and villain. These guys stand on the same shifting moral ground. Washington is playing against type as a lazy bureaucrat forced into the unlikely position of hostage negotiator. Thats why Camonetti (John Turturro) the real negotiator is initially suspicious that Garber and Ryder may be in cahoots. Turturro is a marvel of an actor. His skill sneaks up on you. ""Were like rodeo clowns"" he tells Garber. ""We keep the bull from focusing on what he really wants to do."" Scott possesses the same expertise. He gets the best from the actors including James Gandolfini as a wealthy mayor (any guesses?). The only letdown comes in Scotts handling of the passengers who remain frustratingly generic. What counts is its pressure-cooker cinema heightened by gritty on-location camerawork from Tobias Schliessler that makes you feel the speed danger and dirt in your bones. As the movie hurtles to its finish line with a foot chase less startling than the originals simple sneeze Travolta and Washington never miss a step. With no scenes together until the climax they use their voices their teasing humor and the secret rage of their characters to pump bruised humanity into an action epic that just wants to rock and roll. Its a first-class ride. All aboard. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

(Rico Torres) Joe Neumaier Tuesday June 9 2009 752 AM Title The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 Like the subway itself things move by connections craziness and clockwork in ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" a fast and relentless hostage thriller that never stops.Its not as taut or memorable as the much-loved and far superior 1974 original. That movie had a claustrophobic urban grit and made almost everyone (except its villain) classic city characters especially Walter Matthaus irritable transit officer facing a hijacked Lexington Ave. train. The new version will likely get some good arguments going on real-life 6 trains - did a new version of John Godeys potboiler novel need to be made or is it as necessary as a fare hike? - but in a season when most other actioners are sci-fi comic-bookish or robotically enhanced the pumped-up ""Pelham"" has a trainful of street smarts and is filled with fun performances starting with wildly different yet equally entertaining turns by Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Washingtons Walter Garber is a subway bigwig doing time as a dispatcher who sees an ordinary shift turn into a dog day afternoon when a man calling himself Ryder (Travolta) takes control of a southbound subway train. With three accomplices watching the now-separated lead car Ryder demands 10million and says hell kill one passenger a minute if he doesnt get his money in an hour. Garber and Ryder begin a game of radio-mike cat-and-mouse the thief baiting the working-class hero as cops race to get the cash a hostage negotiator (John Turturro) hovers and the train-riding mayor (James Gandolfini) worries about his image. Its been a while since Travolta has played villainous so he pulls out all the stops - so much so that its a little hard to believe the back story given to his tattooed snarling criminal. Washington goes the opposite way letting a schlumpy walk and middle-aged paunch deflect from the intelligence in his eyes as he searches for a slender thread of humanity in Ryder. Their back-and-forth isnt as gripping as the midmovie chase to get the ransom to Grand Central Station but its the movies backbone. The hostages are basically a terrified mass and thats by design; this ""Pelham"" isnt about getting to know everyone. Director Tony Scotts strength is in hustle bustle and jangling nerves. ""Pelham 1 2 3"" is the perfect vehicle for that. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

But the city really was a rathole in 1974. The original film version of ""Pelham"" came out that year same as ""Death Wish."" In the post-Watergate era urban thrillers loved singing that particular song. Draw a line from ""The Out of Towners"" (1970) through Martin Scorseses masterwork ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) and you end up with a pencil sketch of a great city barely able to hold it together provoking--demanding--desperate measures in desperate times. The old ""Pelham 123"" came straight out of this end-of-the-line era only it wasnt the end of the line. The city is more sanitary now. Forty-Second Street resembles a mall in suburban New Jersey. Theres an Olive Garden in Times Square. Director Tony Scotts ""Pelham"" remake is like that Olive Garden. You dont go to either for surprises. Denzel Washington will be enough for most. In all sorts of genre thrillers (three of them bearing the slick Scott imprimatur) he has delivered movie-star-cool performances that somehow never turn movie-star-cold. Washington is that valuable paradox the relatable supernova. Its too bad the movie around him isnt better--the 74 edition propelled by David Shires incredibly badass theme music kicks the remakes behind all the way to Coney Island--but Washingtons easygoing authority compensates for a lot. From its first iteration as Morton Freedgoods novel written under the pseudonym John Godey ""Pelham"" had simplicity and a ticking clock in its corner. The 74 film starred Walter Matthau as a New York City transit cop locking horns with hijacker Robert Shaw and his cronies ranging from ruthless (Hector Elizondo) to sympathetic (Martin Balsam). With screenwriter Peter Stone supplying the wisecracks the movie--loud fast abrasively funny--combined hostage thrills with ""I Love/Hate New York"" cynicism. The new ""Pelham"" exists in a post-racial universe though Travoltas character known only as ""Ryder"" does have a problem with Italians. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland gets right to it Ryder and cohorts take over a 6 Train and demand 10 million for release of his subway hostages. Washington plays subway dispatcher Walter Garber tainted by a scandal (he may have taken a bribe as we learn early on) but good in the clutch. His cat-and-mouse games with Ryder conducted mostly voice-to-voice behind their respective microphones are meant to illustrate how these men are two sides of the same tainted coin. Helgeland co-adapted ""L.A. Confidential"" which was all about compressing and cutting the source material. ""Pelham"" is the opposite Its narrative is rail-thin so the task for the screenwriter becomes one of adding the right meat to the bones. This he does only fitfully well. No matter how many times Travolta gets to say the phrase with the same number of syllables as ""melon farmer"" Ryder never emerges as an interestingly malignant adversary. ""Pelham"" leans hard on coincidence too. Sharpshooter in the dark just about to fire ... whoops rat up the pants leg Washington popping through a subway grate just in time to see ... his quarry getting into a cab Scott and cinematographer Tobias Schliessler pour on the neon-saturated ""Crimson Tide""-brand telephoto closeups spiced with hyperdramatic freeze-frame effects. Hes a reliable hack but he frames every shot as an isolated dramatic incident so that individual images rarely develop into a well-sustained action sequence. Because the subway train in ""Pelham"" stays put for most of the story the burden shifts to what the characters are yelling at each other. Tricked out with a handlebar mustache that wouldnt be out of place in William Friedkins  ""Cruising"" Travolta can do only so much with his characters laboriously scripted Catholic guilt. James Gandolfini portrays the mayor whose philandering-man-of-privilege biography pulls from the resumes of both Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. John Turturro spits out exposition like a straight-faced pro as an NYPD hostage negotiator though his final meaningful glance in the direction of the storys hero is the sort of punctuation only Tony Scott would feel is necessary. The movie is predictable and thanks mainly to Washingtons canny underplaying fairly diverting. It operates on the same principle the dispatcher espouses near the beginning as the hijackers plan is set in motion ""extreme caution per the rule book."" MPAA rating R (for violence and pervasive language)Running time 146. Opening Friday.Starring Denzel Washington (Walter Garber); John Travolta (Ryder); John Turturro (Camonetti); Luis Guzman (Phil Ramos); Michael Rispoli (John Johnson); James Gandolfini (Mayor) Directed by Tony Scott; written by Brian Helgeland based on the novel by John Godey; produced by Todd Black Scott Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch. A Columbia Pictures release. Posted at 032122 PM Comments I have never written to this great paper though I delivered it as a boy and read it today. Thank you for a well written movie review and especially for the side article about the theme music from the original. I love movies and have complained for years that there is not an original thought in Hollywood. What an excellent review I have no time and must run but I had to tell you there are intelligent people out there reading you and enjoying your insightful articles. Posted by Patrick G. Drury | June 16 2009 at 0508 PM The problem is not that people under 40 are lacking in creativity. It is that the studio system in Hollywood does not know how to harness creativity. Although I dont play video games I can tell how much creativity and talent is behind many of the video games today. The video game business knows how to nurture talent in a way that Hollywood can learn. Second you saw more risk-taking in films from the 70s because movies were much cheaper to make back then. Now with nine figure budgets studios want a guaranteed return which limits the scope of how much risk you can take. Posted by KXB | June 12 2009 at 1146 AM easy. best remake was oceans 11 Posted by brad | June 12 2009 at 1059 AM I agree entirely with poster Ron Burgundy. The creative skills level of original scenario authors has plummetted. I cant think of a single re-make of any film that was superior to the original. And I am convinced that the screen-play computer program cd has been inserted in many Hollywood PCs these past few years. Posted by Sparks | June 12 2009 at 0944 AM I really hope that ron burgundy was being sarcastic because I know a lot of twenty somethings that would say the exact same thing about the overbearing 40+ individuals in our society let alone the baby boomers. Posted by Warren | June 12 2009 at 0918 AM Saved me a few bucks. Thanks. Posted by Terry from Maine | June 12 2009 at 0554 AM I usually refrain from criticizing a commenters writing but Ron you brought it up. Number one you complain about education but you definitely have a problem with punctuation grammar and complete sentences. Number two making blanket statements about the creativity of the under 40-set is foolish inaccurate and reflects pretty poorly on the writer. Hollywood is not devoid of ideas its the majority (but not all) of the viewing public that doesnt have the curiosity or patience to view the films that do have ideas. Coppola has a new movie coming out called Tetro - it looks challenging and intelligent. Just the kind of movie too many people dismiss without giving it a thought. Hollywood product looks pretty barren if you only pay attention to the ""blockbusters"". Try looking beyond the Entertainment Tonight/ Access Hollywood hype machine. Posted by benhere | June 11 2009 at 1015 PM Mr. Phillips thank you for saving me a few bucks Posted by Ryan | June 11 2009 at 0940 PM I agree with ""burgundy""--there was no reason to have remade the 74 version. Some classics should be enjoyed and not remade...also agree with burgundys comment that ppl in Hollywood cant think out enough of a story--or I might add read other fiction that may be adaptable to the screen--but instead resort to remaking movies that in their original film take are classics already in their own right. Whats next? Remake Planet of the Apes or Omega Man? Wait they already did that... Posted by Max Sherwood | June 11 2009 at 0859 PM Why dont you post Michael Phillips video review of this movie along with the print article. That would be a nice experience when coming here to check out movie reviews. Just a suggestion. Jaster Ed. note Its there now Posted by Jaster | June 11 2009 at 0619 PM no reason to remake. Hollyweird is devoid of ideas.lets just point the finger where it should be pointed. PUBLIC EDUCATION. not one person under 40 can thinkcreate develop imagine write... anymore. We are nation of idiots thats about the hope and change I can handle. Posted by ron burgundy | June 11 2009 at 0553 PM Nicely written critique. Posted by Peaches | June 11 2009 at 0525 PM I just watched the 74 film and this is about the 4th time I have seen it and it was still fun thrilling and suspenseful. I hope the new one is as good. Posted by Maureen | June 11 2009 at 0500 PM Excellent review very well written and credibly argued. Posted by John Doze | June 11 2009 at 0455 PM The comments to this entry are closed.

"The Taking of Pelham 123 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Taking of Pelham 123 reviewed. The Taking of Pelham 123 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 11 2009 1156 AM Stand Clear of the Cinema Doors The Taking of Pelham 123 reviewed. By John Swansburg The Taking of Pelham 123 Attention moviegoers The people at Columbia Pictures would like to clear something up. Apparently theres a rumor going around that Tony Scotts new film The Taking of Pelham 123 is a remake of Joseph Sargents 1974 movie The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. This is false. Scotts film is an adaptation of John Godeys 1973 pulp novel The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (on which Sargents movie was also based). This is plainly stated in the films opening credits. Are we clear? John Swansburg John Swansburg is Slates deputy editor. Its easy to imagine why Pelhams producers wouldnt want Scotts professional but dull picture to be compared with the 1974 classic. The original Pelham is an economical well-acted thriller about a subway hijacking. And its also a wickedly funny portrait of 1970s New York as the city teetered on the edge of solvency and governability. In Sargents film when the citys ineffectual mayor is informed that four heavily armed men are holding 19 New Yorkers hostage for a 1 million ransom his honor complains of flu symptoms and goes back to bed. The MTAs cranky dispatcher is no more sympathetic. ""What do they expect for their lousy 35 cents to live forever?"" Advertisement It thus falls to one Lt. Garber (a wonderfully put-upon Walter Matthau) of the transit police to sort out how to rescue the hostages--a cross section of New Yorkers that includes a hippie a suit two bratty kids a white hooker a black pimp a Latina who doesnt speak English a crotchety old man who finds the hijackers ransom demand insultingly low and a drunk who sleeps through the entire ordeal. Joseph Sargent had clearly spent some quality time on the New York City subway. Tony Scott by contrast admitted to the Times that prior to working on Pelham hed actually never been on the subway before. ""Well when I say never I mean maybe once or twice quite drunk at night when I couldnt find a taxi."" For a movie ostensibly set in the citys bowels he frequently contrives to take his camera on helicopter rides. Scotts focus is on his blue-chip stars humble MTA dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington bespectacled) and mercurial hijacking mastermind ""Ryder"" (John Travolta mustachioed). Washington who chunked up a bit for the role of civil servant does his work in a high-tech command center that looks more like NASA than MTA. But the brazen crime that unfolds before him hasnt changed much since 1974. Four heavily armed men hijack a southbound 6 train--the titular Pelham 123 so called because it originated at the Pelham Bay Park Station at 123 p.m.--and hold 19 hostages for ransom. Only this time theyre asking for 10 million. And they have a Wi-Fi connection. The WiFi--conjured somehow by Ryder henchman Phil Ramos (a criminally squandered Luis Guzman)--is important because Ryder isnt actually interested in the 10 million ransom. Thats just a diversion something to keep Garber an NYPD hostage negotiator (John Turturro) and the mayor (James Gandolfini always excellent) busy. The big score will come when the stock market tanks--and precious-metal prices spike--on news of a possible terrorist attack on the New York City subway. Ryders got all his money in gold you see. This is established by several shots of him laughing maniacally as he refreshes CNBC.com on his laptop. Advertisement Ryder we learn is a former Wall Street high roller the kind of guy who would weekend in Iceland with an ""ass model"" (like a hand model he proudly explains to Garber but for asses). When we meet him however hes fresh from a nine-year stint in prison for embezzling money from a city pension fund which perhaps explains why his colorful taunts--""Lick my bunghole motherfucker""--are so charmingly antiquated. Its presumably also the reason Ryder went from being a cutthroat Wall Street trader to being an inked-up thug who blithely guns down innocent civilians on the Lexington Avenue local. Washingtons Garber happens to be watching over the Lexington line when Ryder radios in his demands and he becomes the citys point man in trying to keep Ryder from killing hostages and later improbably in trying to bring him to justice. Does Denzel pull it off? I shouldnt say--I wouldnt want to spoil it for folks who havent yet finished the novel. Heres my question Why did Tony Scott make this movie? He isnt a straphanger. He isnt paying Tarantino-like homage to a film he grew up on. And any implication in Scotts film that New York in 2009 might be in danger of slipping into a 1970s-style malaise is purely incidental. So why did he bother? The issue only becomes more perplexing when you consider the next project hes attached to direct. A new adaptation of Mario Puzos The Godfather? No but only slightly less odd. On deck is a remake of The Warriors the cult classic about gangs in 1970s New York set for long stretches in the citys subway system. (Like Scotts Pelham it was shot largely in Brooklyns Hoyt-Schermerhorn station.) Any train riding in Scotts 2010 version however will be strictly light rail. Tired perhaps of having to wait for the F train while quite drunk hes setting the remake in L.A.

(Stephen Vaughan/Columbia Pictures) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / June 12 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Once upon a time in a land called the early 1970s New York City was a hole. A bankrupt dirty cynical exhausted sewer of urban blight light years away from the citys current status as shiny tourist destination. There were movies made about this New York - ""Dog Day Afternoon"" ""The French Connection"" ""The Out of Towners"" - and one of the best if least remembered was 1974s ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" about the hijacking of a subway train and the MTA dispatcher (Walter Matthau) who tries to stop it.As Matthau was the rumpled wiseass personification of that long-vanished New York - he had a face like the bottom of a Florsheim shoe - Denzel Washington functions as the soul of the new city in Tony Scotts remake ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3."" His character Walter Garber is ethnic and outer borough decent flawed unflappable. Hes one of the thousands of men and women who make the giant metropolis run almost in spite of itself and he understands the weight of that and how at the end of the day its no big deal. Walter anchors this movie like a rock.By itself the new ""Pelham"" is a solid suspenseful tale all over again so long as it stays in the subway tunnels and airless offices of the transit department. It expands the cast to include a few new faces and brings on some of our better Noo Yawk genre actors to play them John Turturro as a capable hostage negotiator and gloriously James Gandolfini as the mayor. (Im assuming Steve Buscemi was vacationing out on the Island.)For all that ""Pelham 1 2 3"" is a film conceived and written in Los Angeles and directed by an Englishman and as soon as it comes up for air its about as New York as ""Top Gun."" That may not matter to you but it does play the material false. As originally written by novelist John Godey ""Pelham"" is a story about a criminal mastermind brought low by a burned-out civil servant just doing his job between the egg creams.The criminal mastermind who calls himself Ryder is played by John Travolta like a dog worrying a large slice of ham. Ryder has taken the 6 Train (it leaves Pelham in the Bronx at 123 p.m.) with a trio of accomplices - two (Victor Gojcaj and Robert Vataj) are big and mean while the third is a disgraced MTA motorman played with ferrety verve by Luis Guzman (its the old Martin Balsam role from the original down to the hat). Ryder issues a demand 10 million in an hour or one passenger dies per minute. This scenario has been updated with some modern flourishes (one of the passengers communicates with his girlfriend via laptop video chat) but the basic setup is simple and foolproof and screenwriter Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") doesnt mess with it. As the citys top brass assembles in the dispatch room the film becomes a war of nerves conducted over the radio between Garber and Ryder. The latter insists on dealing only with Walter whos under a cloud of MTA investigation because he senses a kindred soul - another guy dealt a bum hand by the Big Apple. Travolta goes over the top early and often giggling like Richard Widmark in an old film noir and revealing Ryders needy childish psychosis. The performance is too much and thats the fun of it.""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" tries to take the measure of a subway hijacking in post-9/11 post financial-meltdown New York and at times does it very well zipping around the city and occasionally pulling back for the satellite view filmmaking by Google Earth. Its at its best though in the transit office byplay between Walter and the worried functionaries crowding behind him. Gandolfini is a particular delight as a political top dog with Ed Kochs political savvy Mike Bloombergs cool and Rudy Giulianis domestic problems (and of course Tony Soprano would make a fine mayor).Washington for his part doesnt overplay his role. Thats what Travoltas doing and anyway Walter is a man who has seen it all and heres merely todays worst-case scenario. The film doesnt need to turn him into a hero - he already is one - but Scott knows he has a summer audience to feed and so the last third of ""Pelham"" becomes a demolition derby in the streets of the city with Walter packing a gun like a real movie hero. Matthau just packed a sneer and that was enough.The final act strains believability characters popping out of sidewalk gratings right next to the people theyre chasing through midtown Manhattan and so forth. Its all headed for a showdown thats geographically specific and dramatically vague as though the limo were waiting off-camera to spirit Scott and his crew back to the airport. Say what you will about the original ""Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" - the movies pokey and dated by todays standards - but its climax was electrifying. Scotts train sadly loses its juice well before it reaches the station.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet John Travoltas wildly successful post-comeback crusade to become synonymous with crap continues with The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3 Tony Scotts bracingly awful remake/desecration of the classic 70s thriller. The miscalculations begin with Travoltas distractingly Tetris-shaped facial hair--long rectangular sideburns paired with a geometric Fu Manchu--and extend to every facet of the production. Cursed with following in the outsized footsteps of world-class heavy Robert Shaw Travolta devours the scenery; his performance is 0% inspiration 100% perspiration. Denzel Washington stars as a former New York transit bigwig under a cloud of suspicion after being accused of accepting a bribe from Japanese train manufacturers. A chance for redemption lays on the horizon for the demoted and discouraged Washington after business-minded hood Travolta and his gun-toting band of hooligans takes the titular subway train hostage. Elsewhere James Gandolfini steals the film as a flopsweat-covered mayor concerned primarily with keeping up his approval ratings. Director Tony Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland have replaced the originals exquisitely observed sense of time and place and neat little New York moments with a one-size-fits-all cityscape so generic the film might as well take anywhere and thrown in cutesy bits of business like a slacker video-messaging his girlfriend throughout the ordeal. In a desperate attempt to fake suspense Scott--who once again seems intent on inducing widespread epileptic seizures through frenetic cutting and loud noises--intermittently gets his 24 on by reminding audiences how long is left until Travolta starts killing hostages with breathless graphics accompanied by melodramatic music cues more likely to generate derisive snorts of laughter than nail-biting tension. The filmmakers attempts to inject timeliness and psychological complexity into the film by tying Travoltas shenanigans in with the faltering economy and playing up Travoltas groaningly familiar mind games with Washington backfire. Pelhams big twist is telegraphed well in advance and neither Washington nor Travolta does much with the hoary trope of the predator who psychologically mirrors his prey. Given wonderful source material and a terrific cast--John Turturro and Luis Guzman are among the wasted--its sadly telling that the only thing that really registers is Travoltas strangely flattering comment that in prison the sonorous-voiced Washington would be his bitch.

"Review The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 | Screengrab In Exile Screengrab In Exile The latest writing from all your favorite Screengrab refugees BlogAbout << New Releases DVD - Woodstock plus three  Career Report Card Sam Raimi >> Review The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 Published June 11 2009 Uncategorized 1 Comment Tags denzel washington James Gandolfini john travolta john turturro scott von doviak the taking of pelham 1 2 3 tony scott walter matthau I knew it wasnt going to end with a sneeze. If you havent seen the original 1974 version of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three thats a mild spoiler...but if you havent seen it what are you waiting for? Its a tight little meat-and-potatoes heist flick with plenty of 70s Noo Yawk atmosphere and attitude and a trainload of crackerjack character actors including Walter Matthau Robert Shaw and Martin Balsam. The new version is...well its a Tony Scott film. Thats not entirely a bad thing in this case and I can think of worse ways to while away a hot sticky summer afternoon than ducking into the air-conditioned comfort of the multiplex for a couple of hours worth of jacked-up seat-rattling subway-heisting action. Scotts remake of Pelham is never better than it has to be or than you expect it to be sort of like the popcorn youre eating while watching it. (Hmm...maybe thats why they call em popcorn movies.) John Travolta takes over the Robert Shaw role as the lead hijacker of the subway train known as Pelham 1 2 3 (because it leaves the Pelham Park station at 123 in the afternoon) while Denzel Washington is his foil train dispatcher Walter Garber. With the help of former motorman Phil Ramos (Luis Guzman) Travoltas ""Ryder"" disables the train cuts the front car loose and holds the 19 people therein hostage for ten million dollars. The city of New York (against which Ryder has some grudge unspecified until the end) has one hour to pay up or Ryder starts killing one hostage for each minute the money is late. As ticking-clock scenarios go its a hard one to screw up and Scott mostly doesnt - although he cant resist trying to goose up the tension with his usual array of tricks freeze-frames slow-motion that suddenly speeds up whooshing transitions ear-splitting techno soundtrack. He even throws in a couple of gratuitous car crashes towards the end as if hes worried were starting to nod off. He and screenwriter Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential yes but also The Postman) shoehorn some comic book psychology into the mix trying to give Travolta and Washington the ol two-sides-of-the-same-coin dynamic but that attempt falls flat. Travolta wisely avoids trying to replicate Robert Shaws cool customer vibe instead investing Ryder with a hyper aggrieved victim mentality thats much more in keeping with the current times. Washington makes a sympathetic regular guy under pressure but Scotts best idea is populating the supporting cast with strong New York types including John Turturro as a hostage negotiator and James Gandolfini as the mayor. (In fact the spectacle of Mayor Soprano is almost reason enough to see the movie.) The new version never comes close to capturing the old school grit n grime of the original not to mention the witty simplicity of its finale but as summer express rides go its a diverting trip. - Scott Von Doviak Share thisRedditLike thisLike Loading...

"movie review taking of pelham 123 taking of pelham 123 movie review terrorist new york subway tony scott roger moore john travolta denzel washington - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Taking of Pelham 123 3 of 5 stars John Travolta Sony Sony Roger MooreSentinel Staff Writer That 1970s action classic The Taking of Pelham 123 earns an efficient if not exactly riveting treatment from Tony Scott the lesser of the two hyper-editing Scott brothers. It stars Tonys go-to actor Denzel Washington. But the film is built around and wholly dependent on John Travolta chewing a microphone and chowing down on what little scenery there is underground as the tattooed foul-mouthed mastermind of a New York subway car hijacking.""This is the man whos going to rock this city"" he crows into the mike through a fierce Fu Manchu mustache. Travolta is ""Ryder"" the guy who takes control of Pelham 123. Washington is Garber the dispatcher on the other end of that microphone the ""man with a past"" in the control center forced to deal with the killers who take over a car and its 19 passengers. Killers? They must be madmen he thinks and we all think. How can you hold hostages for ransom underground with any hope of escaping?Ryder is the prototypical modern movie ""madman"" -- absurdly chatty philosophical more a talk-radio guy than a gangster with a gun. He couches everything in market terms and even though they dont share many scenes -- Washington is as rapt as everybody else at Ryders patter. ""What is the going rate for a New York City hostage today?""Scott juices their exchanges with a cacophony of train sound effects and a whiplash blur of edits. Ryder dismisses the police hostage negotiator ( John Turturro cool collected) and insults the lame duck mayor ( James Gandolfini) as he counts down the minutes toward the deadline for 10 million to be delivered to him.Brian Helgelands new script based on the John Godey Pelham novel sets up moral dilemmas that dont reach any sort of intellectually sensible conclusion. Its a glib piece of work suggesting Scotts True Romance where people are dying but theres still time for jokes wisecracks and little moments ripped from ""An aphorism a day"" calendar.""A good Catholic knows that nobody is innocent"" ""We all owe God a death"" Its a movie that gives you little to ponder and one thats more easily quoted than felt. We barely get to know the train passengers -- the kid (Alex Kaluzhsky) whose wi-fi connection allows his girlfriend to televise events from his laptop inside the train the mom with the young son the guy with the shy bladder. Empathy is in short supply even when people die. At least Garbers wife (Aunjanue Ellis) is able to turn it on in her big phone conversation scene.Thats one of the problems with this era of the cell-phone thriller. Theyre great for filling in plot for ratcheting up tension for placing actors who might be available for filming at different times in the same scene. But they can make for an emotionally sterile movie experience.Travolta sells this stuff and how. He always seems to relish his villainous turns and this is up there with his Broken Arrow-Swordfish-Face/Off turns -- over the top and loving it.The thing that keeps bringing The Great Denzel back is that he and Tony make hits together -- Crimson Tide Man on Fire Deja Vu.But Pelham for its crowd-pleasing heart-racing virtues -- and it does get us going several times -- plays out like a Tony-Denzel pairing that Denzel at least should have taken a pass on.

The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (Fair) Director Tony Scott. Cast Denzel Washington John Travolta James Gandolfini. Rating R for violence and pervasive language. Spotlight John Travolta Spotlight Denzel Washington Hostage movies Silver-screen heavyweights Travolta thanks colleagues for promoting film Guzman The man behind that familiar face Train-ing day for Denzel Washington Review of the original The Taking of Pelham One Two Three Nothing about his remake of ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" will change that. Scott turns up the volume and leaves it there the sheer noise of it all overpowering amusing performances by Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Oh sure like a wild party its fun until something gets broken - in this case first the script then whatever spell the film had on the audience. The premise is relatively simple Four men led by a tattooed scary-looking fellow called Ryder (Travolta) hijack a New York City subway train. They obviously know a great deal about how the subway system works and are demanding 10 million in one hour or theyll begin killing a hostage for every minute past the deadline. All this lands in the lap of Walter Garber (Washington) a mild-mannered former supervisor busted down to dispatcher while undergoing an investigation. His expertise comes in handy but its his demeanor thats most valuable. Certainly Ryder prefers dealing with him rather than the citys hostage negotiator (John Turturro). Ryder has a grudge against the entire city; actually one that he has nursed to the point of violent action. Word is delivered to the mayor (James Gandolfini) an ineffectual sort - hampered by an extramarital affair - who is not running for re-election. Scott means to show that everyone - Ryder Garber the mayor - is flawed. And everyone is. But not everyone takes a subway car hostage at gunpoint so the parallels dont quite hold. Then again this isnt the place you go to look for tales of redemption. This is where you go to watch Travolta and Washington banter back and forth - Travolta unhinged having a ball Washington an exercise in controlled precision. When theyre talking to one another over the communications system the film is a lot of fun. When theyre not - or when inevitably they meet face-to-face - it loses momentum quickly. Once Garber leaves the dispatch station ""Pelham"" begins to rely on increasingly dumb coincidences. Granted the trick isnt hijacking a subway car its getting out of the tunnels beneath the streets of New York. But too many chance occurrences stretch credulity to the breaking point; the exact right person shows up at the exact right time too often. Theres fun to be had in ""Pelham"" at least for a while but nothing more than that. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Read his blog at goodyblog.azcentral.com.

The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 avoids both detours -- its neither too raw nor too nostalgic. And in the hands of director Tony Scott its relevant but not too distressing something that doesnt shy away from jolting violence but is also you know fun. Thats a pretty good trick for an open-hydrant whoooosh of an action thriller about a hijacked NYC subway train with passengers held as hostages -- a caffeinated update of a 1974 city-on-fire cult classic that cracked wise with a cynical now nostalgia-inducing graffiti-era veracity. (The original movie was based on a novel by Brooklyn native son Morton Freedgood who used the crime-fiction pen name John Godey.) It makes perfect sense that Scott would be the director who dared the remake. The Brit comes from the dart-and-weave school of music videos and made Top Gun and Crimson Tide among many other movies. With Pelham he has delivered a souped-up multiculti metropolis of his own invention a world capital thats sort of recognizable as the home of high rollers low crazies and regular transit-system schmos but also clearly a construct a stage for his characteristic Scott stuff. As in the first movie the story centers on a hijacking mastermind and the transit schmo who faces him down (they were played to unhinged and schlumpy perfection respectively by Robert Shaw and Walter Matthau). But in this new New York cat and mouse are no longer the quirky loners they were in the original. Now in Brian Helgelands quick-thinking script the antagonists have sprawly psychological backstories and theyre played by big stars with equally sprawly paychecks. John Travolta is the guy who recruits a small crew of thugs takes over the train demands ransom money on a tight schedule and threatens to kill passengers. And working with his director for the fourth time (most recently in 2006s Deja Vu) a beefy Denzel Washington makes the unexpected interpretive choice of letting a mild demeanor mask a spikier inner life as the dispatcher on duty. Not that the backstories mean a thing. The moviemakers go out of their way to suggest why Travolta as a guy now called Ryder (gone are the nifty goon names from 1974 -- Mr. Blue Mr. Gray etc.) would be such a high-strung chatterbox with a porn-star stache and a Roman Catholic religious streak. Time is also wasted explaining why Washington is more conflicted than your average civil servant. And the script now makes room for business involving a hostage negotiator (John Turturro) a hidden video cam that captures the subway chaos on a hipsters laptop a cameo or two from real local-TV news anchors and a lesson about stock-market vulnerability. But in the end its really all about the chase the ticktock of the clock as regular guys scramble to thwart irregular guys. Scott gets into the zip and rush of urban energy with an enthusiasm bordering on hilarity. (More than once that energy goes haywire with silly vertiginous 360-degree spins around guys...just...talking.) This Pelham doesnt try too hard for timeliness since really hijacking timeliness in post-9/11 New York is too terrifying to offer as summer entertainment. But with one character at least the movie has fun with the present. In a thoroughly comfortable delight-the-audience performance James Gandolfini plays the mayor of New York -- and not for nuthin is this politician in charge of the city that never sleeps. The fictional Mr. Mayor has the wealth and Wall Street acumen of the current mayor Mike Bloomberg -- and a hint of the grandiosity (and divorce follies) of the previous office-holder Rudy Giuliani. In the first Pelham the mayor was something of a schnook propped up by his staff a joke. But the elected official played by Gandolfini is a believable pol in a wild ride of a movie every viewer needs to believe is only a movie.

Start by watching 1974s The Taking of Pelham One Two Three a primer in which subway hijackers test how long itll take a million bucks to pass through Gothams plumbing. Turns out an hour is just enough time to roust the hated mayor out of bed; convince him that 1 million is cheap for the hostages sure votes; get the treasury on the horn; and gridlock traffic by wrecking the drop-off car. And yet in the end a web of interlocked dysfunction from Gracie Mansion to the Transit Authority defeats the crooks well-oiled machine.At the time the movie didnt connect with audiences except as legend has it in cities with subways. Those without may have been less sympathetic--especially at the nadir of Fun Citys crime-ridden mid-70s image crisis just a year before Ford told NY to drop dead. But in the years after 9/11 helped no doubt by shout-outs in Reservoir Dogs and the Beastie Boys ""Sure Shot"" The Taking of Pelham One Two Three took on new life--a parable of punch-clock New Yorkers surly resilience in the face of aggression.With this second remake of Pelham (the first was a late-90s TV rehash starring Edward James Olmos and Vincent DOnofrio) director Tony Scott turns a presciently post-9/11 movie into an explicitly post-9/11 movie. Make that post-post-9/11 The chief bad guy only looks like a terrorist when in fact hes an even scarier more au courant foe--a commodities trader (Hey some ticket buyers might actually have sympathy for a terrorist.) But if self-conscious stabs at significance dont sound like as much fun as the originals unpretentious caper thrills thats because theyre not.Thats not to say this Pelham never makes it out of the station even if its near-constant pummeling-by-montage is a losing swap for the 74 Pelhams urbane black humor. If not for that dull TV version a decade ago which packed all the excitement of buying tokens it would be tempting to call the basic outline of John Godeys novel indestructible Four gunmen seize a subway car and its passengers and demand a fortune in one hour while a transit official stalling for time plays head games with the gangs mastermind.In the original the transit rep was grouchy Walter Matthau embodying a spirit of sourpuss resistance. His part has been reconceived for Denzel Washington as more of a turning worm a disgraced official Garber who has been busted back down to the rank and file. Hes the poor bastard who picks up a call from the crimes ringleader Ryder--John Travolta subbing for Robert Shaws icy Mr. Blue--and becomes his negotiator and eventual cash mule into the tunnels of subterranean Manhattan.The crackling give-and-take between Travolta a hair-triggered showboating Joker whose crimes evidently include swiping the mustache off the Village Peoples biker and the smartly low-key Washington gives the new Pelham most of its juice. No other actor makes such an art of modulating his performances from situation to situation than Washington. You can read his characters standing in any situation by Washingtons gradations of subservience--whether in the presence of Garbers immediate supervisor or Hizzoner himself (James Gandolfini a spiky cocktail of Bloombergs financial savvy and Giulianis libido)--with his few moments of equal footing reserved for an interrogating officer (a quietly insinuating John Turturro).On paper Pelham would appear a good fit for the erratic Scott whose style has morphed with time and technology into a kind of cubist barrage of image fragments. Synch him up with a techno thriller like Enemy of the State or the recent Deja Vu and his ADD direction seems apt exciting a manifestation of electronic surveillance culture gone viral infecting even the movies editing scheme. In Deja Vu he pulled off a car chase--occurring simultaneously in two different time periods--that maybe five other directors in the history of movies could have pulled off with such panache and lucidity let alone helped conceive.But Scott applies that technique indiscriminately feeding projects as diverse (in everything but lousiness) as Domino and Man on Fire into the same woodchipper. Here Scotts camera acrobatics have so little to do with the events theyre recording that they leave hiccups in the movies momentum. Swoosh The camera goes flying this way past Denzel Swoosh The camera goes sailing the other way. Wheee It orbits Gandolfini so vertiginously he might as well lean over and smooch Kim Novak. At his most frenetic and least disciplined Scott doesnt tell the story He advertises it from shot to shot.In the original Pelham director Joseph Sargents uncluttered direction played up the sweaty-collared confinement of the subway car and the transit office locking the cops and crooks each in their own pressure cooker. Which marks oh the 50th time Ive unfavorably compared the remake to the original--the lazy reviewers default setting to be sure. But Scotts redo comes up short in almost every regard against the 74 model--against David Shires knuckled-brass score against its mugs gallery of 70s New York character actors against Peter Stones serrated script and certainly against its wordless punchline beside which the new versions gloppy coda looks sappy indeed. If its somehow unfair to compare the two why was The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 even remade?

Predictably ratcheted up a few notches from the original 1974 film and cloaked in contemporary sociological relevance ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" is an efficiently reworked version of a tense ticking-clock suspense story. More than anything a fascinating portrait of how much New York has changed in 35 years the film delivers the goods in excitement and big-star charisma with the contrasting low-key and cranked-up acting styles of Denzel Washington and John Travolta playing off one another nicely. Comparatively low-tech thriller looks to hijack solid-to-strong returns for Sony before the tentpoles take over most of the nations screens. First adaptation of John Godeys novel is a minor classic in the early-70s school of gritty Gotham crime yarns. Directed by Joseph Sargent and written by Peter Stone it pitted Walter Matthaus sardonic subway dispatcher against Robert Shaws cold-blooded mercenary as the latter commandeered a subway train and promised to start killing one hostage per minute unless 1 million in cash was delivered within an hour. The contrast between the old and new pictures is less interesting as a comparison of styles -- with Tony Scott you know what youre going to get in terms of heavily worked images and blaring soundtrack -- than as one of society. In the early 70s as reflected in ""Pelham"" the city looked grungy to the point of dilapidation verging on political meltdown (the portrait of a sickly mayor who just wants to hide in bed is jaw-dropping) and dominated ethnically by Jews and Italians. This time around the transit systems central control HQ is as high-tech as a NASA command post local authorities are tight knots of anxious professionalism and the population is a rainbow coalition come to fruition. Communication is also a whole lot better -- even if theres still no wireless service on the subway -- and the casual racism and sexism of some of the characters in the original are mostly gone. Eschewing inessentials Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland get right down to business. An armed gang of four led by the thuggish-looking Ryder (Travolta) efficiently takes over the lead car of a downtown 6 train shoots a plainclothes cop and with 18 hostages cowering at gunpoint gives the city 60 minutes to hand over -- inflation well taken into account -- 10 million. Finding this crisis in his lap is dispatcher Walter Garber (Washington) who insists to Ryder that hes ""just a guy"" a cog in the city bureaucracy with no power to deal with a high-stakes hostage situation. But in between issuing blunt demands and threats Ryder takes an apparent liking to the regular Joe pressing him about his life and in the process revealing scraps of useful information about himself. Helgelands script thus pushes into directions Stones did not establishing personal links between the hijacker and his opposite number. But the film also is interested in a bigger picture; a dark episode in Garbers career is pushed front and center forcing a facile but still provoking contrast concerning degrees gravity and justifiability of different types of criminality from high to low white-collar to blue-collar municipal to private. Pressed any further the thematic implications would become pretentious but as is the elaboration grafts a little meat onto generic characters. With the minutes quickly counting down Garber is briefly replaced at the microphone by a professional hostage negotiator (John Turturro); the mayor (James Gandolfini very good) moans and groans while dashing about town; hundreds of cops are deployed; and with another killing Ryder makes it deadly clear hes not kidding. Compact story and high-pressure situation would seem to make this an all but fool-proof thriller concept and Scott messes up only in his execution of a climactic stretch in which Ryder sends the subway car loose on a high-speed run toward Coney Island. By artificially jimmying the film speed indulging in step-framing and his other visual tricks the director in fact decreases the terrifying sense of speed that smart editing of real-time cinematography can provide. Final act has been contrived to get Garber out of his antiseptic office and down into the subway tunnel where he can morph into something resembling an action hero. Washingtons notably increased bulk makes it unlikely he could run as fast and far as he must here but the actors time-tested skill at quietly setting the bait with masterful underplaying and making it all pay off down the line prevails once again. As for Travolta his over-the-top early scenes create some concern. But as Ryder settles into his verbal sparring with Garber the characterization becomes more modulated and the actors obviously delight with his role becomes contagious. Shaw gave real understated gravity to his version of the part and remains the strongest element of the original film but Travolta takes the baddie in an entirely different direction and does just fine. Ryders three cohorts should have been given a few lines with which to individualize themselves while a few of the hostage characters have their moments. Location work provides plenty of atmosphere as do the extensive scenes below ground.

And Woodys latest By David Edelstein Published Jun 7 2009 ShareThis (Photo Stephen Vaughn/Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) Director Tony Scott keeps the remake of the 1974 thriller The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 in constant motion. True the New York subway car being held by gunmen under the command of John Travolta is stopped dead between stations and humble dispatcher Denzel Washingtonwho pleads/negotiates/debates/swaps personal stories with Travolta while everyone waits for the ransom to be paidis largely confined to his desk. But the camera First it circles counterclockwise around Washington. Then it circles clockwise. Then its back to counterclockwise this time jumping to close-up. Then its clockwise again except with more urgency the beads of sweat on Washingtons brow reflecting the periwinkle blue of the subway command centers monitors which also tie in nicely with the blue of hostage negotiator John Turturros shirt and the lights of the tunnel as dispersed by droplets on the trains windows. As Scotts camera continues to circle hopscotch swing on the monkey bars and whoosh around a grid of Manhattan Washington asks Travolta if hes a terrorist and Travolta cackles Do I sound like a terrorist? This is just about money? Is there anything else? Thats the films most credible exchange. Watching this Pelhama money job from its conceptionyou can believe that theres no other motivation on Earth. Has the memory of the original Pelham been sullied? Not really. Its a broad artless pushy film that seems proud of its parade of ethnic cartoon figures as if to say What makes New York New York is that we play our stereotypes to the hilt But it was at least of its era. Starring the jaded shambling Walter Matthau and scripted by Peter Stone Pelham was a New York Jewish comedy writers take on the modern metropolis going meshuggener. Scotts might as well have been set in Toronto. For all the syncopated helicopter shots of the city no image is held for long enough to give us a true sense of place. Scott has the filmmakers equivalent of a neurological condition When he cuts to a new shot he cant seem to remember the last oneand hes always cutting circling fussing with the lighting BACKSTORY Inflations taken its toll since the original Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 in which the hostage ransom was 1 million. (For the remake its 10 million plus a penny.) In the older film though maybe the funniest detail is not that paltry demand its the mayors response to it. Referring to the fiscal crisis he turns to his deputy played by Tony Roberts and cries Goddammit This city hasnt got a million dollars His condition must have been contagious since writer Brian Helgeland introduces and drops enough plot points to make another movie. The mayor (James Gandolfini who gets to make a Giuliani joke so that we dont confuse him with the last less-charismatic Italian mayor) susses out Travoltas real motivation and rushes off to save the dayand thats the last we hear of his plan. A passengers dropped laptop sends out images of the captors who dont realize theyre on camerabut nothing comes of that information. Travoltas high-tech 21st-century scheme turns out to be not just preposterous but superfluous demented Why would he need to do something so so 1974 as hijacking a subway train to do what a lot of hedge-fund managers do before breakfast? Travolta doesnt suggest a man who cares one way or the other though. Like everyone else behind The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 he got his money up front. Woody Allen reportedly wrote Whatever Works around the same time as Annie Hall and made only a few cosmetic changes before he shot it last year and if thats true its depressing on too many levels to contemplate. It suggests that even back in the seventies at his most potent and fearless he had the soul of a sclerotic old misanthrope. Allens protagonist Boris (Larry David) an out-of-work physics professor is not a heroic mouthpiece Hes meant to be a pompous crank a windbag. But as he bellows his long monologues about cosmic injustice and entropy and the stupidity of religious faith (the phrase whatever works is the Jewish shrug that makes tragedy comedy a sort of Life suckswhere do you wanna eat?) its only his affect thats objectionable. Hes the lone character with stature and theres nothing and no one with the capacity to take him ononly to insult him or in the case of women leave him. Allens movies are infused with self-hatred yet completely reinforce that hateful selfs worldview. It seemed like a good idea to cast David as Allens alter ego and not just because he has the Seinfeld-HBO cachet. As the model for George on Seinfeld and in Curb Your Enthusiasm hes too defended (and later too rich) to care about social mores and other peoples feelings and his lack of hypocrisy is refreshing. In small doses he turns the narcissistic jerk into a hipster. But as an actor he has no equipment for suggesting a conflicted inner life Its all just straight to the camera uninflected bombast. So he depersonalizes the movie. He comes off like a Woody Allen robot You push its button and it gravitates to sexy young girls and lectures them on the meaninglessness of life the shallowness of youth and the superiority of Beethoven and Fred Astaire to this modern rock noise that all sounds the same. In this case the girl is an unlikely southern runaway played by Evan Rachel Wood who is impossibly pretty and long-waisted and channels Holly Hunter down to the cute little upward twist of her mouth. So both characters are like robots standing in for other people. 1 2 Next Share this story...
