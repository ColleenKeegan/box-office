This schlock weeper is ""Its a Wonderful Life"" remade as a shark-out-of-water comedy - its family-values porn for commitmentphobes. Cage does dryly funny double takes as Jack confronts the workaday horror of his new situation. But the actors moon-dog mug is required to go misty once too often and the outsize ticky-tackiness of Jacks new life has been stitched together out of the broadest possible series of Middle American cliches.

(Barry Wetcher/Universal) Ah Christmas. Time for my favorite kind of movie the phony-hokey over-sentimentalized family saga with its treacly writing its flamboyantly insincere performances and its head-beaning Muzak. Ah Christmas But the best thing is the moral instruction. In ""The Family Man"" Hollywood slicksters whove crushed the weak to get where they are caution us on the beauties of banality and how wed be so much better off if we stayed little people in little houses our heads unturned by the same greed that drove them to work so remorselessly. In this one - which must have been put together by someone who watched ""Its a Wonderful Life"" after a little too much eggnog and methamphetamine - Nicolas Cage plays a high-rolling international investment star who is shunted into an alternate universe by a helpful angel and comes to see the pleasures of living in a crappy house in New Jersey. Thats what happens to Cages Jack Campbell who goes to bed a single hipster in a co-op building on the fashionable East Side and awakens in a three-bedroom in Paramus or points west. Thats not a supermodel nestled up against him its a big slobbery dog. As he quickly learns in his new life he doesnt run with the wolves he sells tires. Instead of which Oxxford suit to wear each morning his haberdashery choices are name tag or not and which polyester shirts go with which polyester pants? Shoes? Hmmm the Thom McAns or for more formal occasions the cordovan Dexters? On the other hand he gets to sleep with Tea Leoni so what exactly would the problem be? He also has kids and because after all this is a Hollywood movie they are cute. Theyre not stupid shrieking leeches drooling crumbrats who steal things and wont learn what the toilet is and fight over their Christmas toys and then break them like you know real kids. Oh no They say wise things or just sit there quietly radiating adorability. Too much of the movie is pure formula nonsense which follows as Jack struggles to learn the rules of his new world. But the truth is there are no rules Angel Don Cheadle for reasons of complete arbitrariness has thrust him into the life he possibly would have had if he had not gone on to England on an internship and instead remained home with Kate (Leoni) whom he left crying at the airport in his wake. But if the angel has the power to stick him in a new life why cant he stick him with enough information to understand it? The reason is that we wouldnt then have the movies one joke repeated tediously which is super-cool Jack looking at his new closet his new job his new friends his bowling league and affecting a look of abject horror. But even within the framework of the angelic-intervention genre this film isnt well constructed. ""Its a Wonderful Life"" on the other hand was so well thought out that every single seeming coincidence or whimsical detail ultimately came to be a factor in the movies resolution. That was professional storytelling at its most disciplined. Here nobody cares about such things. In one sloppiness the movie opens in Jacks fabulous life with him on the brink of a huge deal but also running a major risk; this story is left unclosed the curiosity that it has incited unslaked. Frank Capra would never have been so stupid. But far worse is the ending which utterly destroys the movie. Capra again had the brilliance to bring things full circle He really lets you have it with both barrels. The ""Family Man"" screenwriters - David Diamond and David Weissman and who knows who wrote what why and when because its one of those credits adjudicated by the Writers Guild - can come up with no worthwhile ending. It ends up with an inappropriate sense of loss for the vanished universe it has spent so much time portraying and one feels a grief that the movie never recovers from. But instead of grieving our last image of Jack depicts him chatting with a pretty stranger in an airport a woman about whom we know nothing and we care less. Even hokum has its rules and by the physics of hokum ""The Family Man"" is a mess It cant even get the cliches right. ""The Family Man"" (126 minutes) is rated PG-13 for mild sexual innuendo and crude language.

Starring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni. Directed by Brett Ratner. (PG-13. At Bay Area theaters. 103 minutes.) The saddest words in the English language as Al Gore knows but would certainly never say are ""what might have been."" In ""The Family Man"" Nicolas Cage gives a performance that invites audiences to lay cynicism aside in a romantic fable about a rich Wall Street wheeler-dealer bachelor who learns to love the life he might have had as an ordinary suburban family man. Perfectly cast Tea Leoni matches him move for move as the level-headed but earthy wife he let get away but now sees only in one long time-warp ""glimpse."" At least thats what the (heaven-sent?) figure who set it all up calls it. He is played with several surprises up his sleeve by Don Cheadle. ""The Family Man"" begins in 1987 when ambitious young Jack Campbell (Cage) starts to say goodbye at the airport to his apprehensive girlfriend Kate (Leoni). She begs him to stay. He thinks he is going to London for only a year to learn the international banking business. He will not see her again for 13 years. He loses track of her but finds his way to the corner office in the executive suite of a conglomerate where he is such a credit to capitalism as his boss calls him that he keeps the staff at work on Christmas Eve to engineer one of the largest mergers in U.S. history. It is the fast-lane life he always dreamed of. He lives in the penthouse of a Manhattan co-op has a closetful of 2400 suits and gorgeous women constantly knocking on his door to sleep with him. One of the nice things about Cages performance is that he lets us see that this master of the universe is not a monster or even a bad guy. Jack in fact does a selfless good deed that leads to his glimpse of what would have happened if he hadnt gotten on that airplane. On whats left of Christmas Eve he goes to bed by himself in sleek black briefs and wakes up the next morning in plaid boxers. He is in a strange bed with a vaguely familiar blonde snuggling on his belly. It is Kate and she apparently is his wife. They have apparently two kids and a dog also in their bed. Merry Christmas. Jack slowly discovers that he has traded Manhattan for Teaneck N.J. his penthouse for a four-bedroom house and mortgage his Ferrari for a minivan. He is a tire salesman for his father-in-laws company. Cage is very good as a fish not altogether out of water in suburbia. His guide to the ins and outs of family life is his 6-year-old daughter (lisping Makenzie Vega) who suspects that he is not really her dad. In Teaneck Jack also learns the come-ons of adulterous wives and other suburban customs. As he catches on to his ""other"" life Cage manages the neat trick of asking questions that sound like statements. ""So youre a lawyer"" he says to his wife. Leoni conveys a combination of intelligence healthy appetite and sensible satisfaction with her life that makes us see why Jack might fall in love with her all over again. But as a glimpse it must end. Sooner or later Jacks two lives must come together. As Yogi Berra said ""When you come to a fork in the road take it."" Cages Jimmy Stewart toupee acknowledges that this is exactly the sort of role that Stewart would have played in another era and in fact did in Frank Capras ""Its a Wonderful Life"" in 1946. Just as Stewart was probably the most versatile movie actor of his time Cage is of ours. Cages range is impressive from suicidal drunk to wild man to soulful lover to action hero and various combinations thereof. Here he is the generously spirited axis of a sentimental comedy and brings it off. Like Stewart Cage can segue from light comedy to a moving statement of conviction with no crunching of gears. Actually ""The Family Man"" is not just a fable about what might have been. It is a story about someone who learns to love his own life. Anyone can do it.

(Barry Wetcher/Universal) ""The Family Man"" is nothing more or less than a cheap dirty grab at our Christmas spirit accompanied by those movie ads - full of accolades from critical pinheads. ""A New Christmas Classic Is Born"" trumpets Jan Wolf of NBC-TV. ""Touching soulful and hilarious"" exclaims Mark S. Allen of UPN-TV. Puh-leez. While ""Family Man"" isnt ""Battlefield Earth"" it certainly isnt ""Its a Wonderful Life"" the Hollywood classic that this Universal Pictures release desperately tries to imitate. In ""Family Man"" James Stewart I mean Nicolas Cage plays Jack Campbell an investment banker who rules Wall Street like a ninja. He even works on Christmas Eve to make more money. And although he has no family to speak of he does have this expensive little hooker in mind for his Christmas cheer. ""Youre a credit to capitalism"" coos one of his admiring associates. Everyone arrange yourselves into carol-singing formations stand outside Jacks impossibly expensive Manhattan apartment and hiss. Now youre getting it. When we first meet Jack 13 years before this we see the critical crossroads in his life that led him here. Heading to London on a promising banking internship hes at the airport saying goodbye to his sweetheart Kate (Tea Leoni and not Helen Hunt). She wants him to stay. She has this feeling theyll never get back together again. But he goes just the same. Whattaguy. Kate was right. Here he is all these years later making money all over the place. Kates a distant memory. In fact when she calls out of the blue he blows her off. Time for a Hollywood intervention. The predictable angel (Don Cheadle) gives Jack one of those extended second chances a whole lifetime with Kate - the one he could have had if only theyd stuck together. Jack wakes up in a different world a New Jersey suburb where he sells tires and lives with two screaming kids and the lovely Kate for a wife. ""Wheres my Ferrari?"" asks Jack trying to run away. Touching soulful hilarious Will Jack learn to love bad clothes and bowling nights with his true pals (including Jeremy Piven)? When will he wake up walk the dog and learn to smell Mr. Coffee? Oh boy weve got so much to endure and the movies barely begun Director Brett Ratner who made ""Rush Hour"" doesnt do more than steer this conventional soul-cleansing from beginning to end. Cage is left to do his damndest to entertain us through the tedium. Hes the only thing on display and its not enough to appreciate his uncanny resemblance to Stewart his obvious hair weave and his ability to come up with an unexpectedly funny expression or two. If I were his angel Id lean close to his ear and sweetly whisper ""Why not make it easier on yourself Nic? Dont seek a better life seek a better movie.""

Schmaltz often sells well during the yuletide season so Universal may have a ""Patch Adams""-size hit on it hands with ""The Family Man"" a slickly produced slice of sentimental hokum that borrows freely from a half-dozen or so other better feel-good fantasies. The only question is whether audiences will pay firstrun admission prices to see something this synthetic when they can savor TV reruns of the real thing -- i.e. ""Its a Wonderful Life"" -- for free. Hard-sell marketing savvy positioning and marquee allure of Nicolas Cage should be enough to generate strong initial interest and decent legs for this Christmas-set confection. Once again taking full advantage of slightly against-the-grain casting Cage is improbably but impressively adept at playing a high-powered Wall Street warrior whos magically granted a brief glimpse of the simpler life he could have lived on the road not taken. Prologue set in 1987 introduces Cages character Jack Campbell just before he boards a London-bound plane. Hes eager to pursue a one-year internship at a prestigious British bank -- but slightly uneasy about separating from Kate (Tea Leoni) his fetching law-student girlfriend. Kate warns Jack that if he gets on that plane the separation likely will be a permanent one. Flash forward 13 years and guess what? Kate was right. Not that Jack seems to mind his bachelor life as a high-rolling mergers-and-acquisitions whiz. Indeed when his faithful secretary (Mary Beth Hurt) reports an out-of-the-blue telephone call from the almost-forgotten Kate Jack brushes aside the news as an unwelcome blast from the past. Jack has too many important things on his mind -- like a major deal that keeps him working on Christmas Eve and a beautiful casual acquaintance he wants to unwrap on Christmas Day -- to waste time on nostalgia. Director Brett Ratner (""Rush Hour"") doesnt often avoid the obvious. To his credit however he does refrain from pushing Cage toward the kind of excessive unpleasantness that actors cast as self-involved workaholics usually evidence in this kind of comedy. Indeed Jack triggers his own comeuppance through an impulsively selfless act when he talks a mood-swinging gun-wielding street punk out of shooting bystanders during a convenience-store fracas. True to his wheeler-dealer roots Jack ""bargains"" with Cash (Don Cheadle) who turns out to be a cross between the wise would-be angel played by Henry Travers in ""Wonderful Life"" and the crafty life-rearranger played by Michael Caine in ""Mr. Destiny."" He knows what Jack really wants or at least what he really needs and gives it to the poor guy. The next morning Jack awakens in a parallel universe where hes been married to Kate for 13 years. Hes a long long way from Wall Street -- specifically in a New Jersey suburb where hes employed at a discount tire store owned and operated by his blustering father-in-law (Harve Presnell). Jack has a loyal bowling buddy (Jeremy Piven) two children -- 6-year-old Annie (Makenzie Vega) and infant Josh (Jake and Ryan Milkovich) -- and a wardrobe that causes him no end of pain and embarrassment. He knows something is terribly wrong -- and so does little Annie who thinks hes an alien impersonating her beloved father. Jack isnt entirely sure that shes wrong. In this and several other respects ""Family Man"" plays more than a little like a gender-switched version of last years ""Me Myself I"" the underrated Aussie comedy in which Rachel Griffiths memorably essays an unhappily single magazine writer who finds herself miraculously married to the fellow she ditched 13 years earlier. Similarities between the two pics are almost certainly coincidental -- according to the production notes screenwriters David Diamond and David Weissman first pitched their project in 1995 -- but nonetheless pronounced. For more than half of its length ""Family Man"" wrings easy laughs from Jacks not-so-quiet desperation in lower-middle-class discontent. (Cage conveys Jacks mounting horror with just the right degree of darkly comic edginess.) Pic depicts suburbia as not unlike a lower circle of hell populated with uncouth clods who know nothing about mergers acquisitions or even fine wines. After an hour or so however Ratner and his writers attempt a jarring about-face to show Jack falling in love with his wife his children and his low-profile life as a salt-of-the-earth Joe Average. The switch is to put it charitably a great deal less than persuasive. Filmmakers flash more mixed signals in their inconsistent characterization of Kate who apparently guilt-tripped Jack into forsaking his Wall Street career for her fathers business. Dark suspicions multiply when late in the pic Jack gets a credibility-stretching second chance to work for his old bosses at the company where he thrived before being transformed into a bowling suburbanite. Instead of being overjoyed that Jack has a priceless opportunity Kate expresses profound displeasure and more or less demands that her husband remain unfulfilled and underemployed. It reflects highly on Leonis acting talent and charisma that even though her character is given to off-putting and arbitrary behavior she remains sympathetic. It doesnt hurt that she plays Kate with enough alluring sensuality to lend at least a modicum of credence to Jacks third-act embrace of suburban life. Cheadle makes the most of his few scenes as the ambiguous Cash. Among the other supporting players standouts include Piven as Jacks none-too-bright but decent best friend and Saul Rubinek and Josef Sommer as Jacks companions in corporate wheeler-dealing. As Jacks suspicious young daughter Vega affects a working-class accent that is meant to be endearingly comical but only serves to make her seem a bit strange.Production package is suitably handsome with notably strong contributions from cinematographer Dante Spinotti and production designer Kristi Zea.
