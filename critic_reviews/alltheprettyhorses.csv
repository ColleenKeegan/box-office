In ""All the Pretty Horses"" the film version of the acclaimed Cormac McCarthy novel the sky not only frames a young mans life but provides a vast romantic vessel for his thoughts and dreams. In the first scene when John Grady Cole (Matt Damon) lies on his back and regards the stars and a half moon he seems completely at home. ""Do you suppose theres a heaven and a hell?"" his buddy Rawlins (Henry Thomas) asks. ""I guess you can believe what you want to"" John Grady answers with a sweet drawl. Directed by Billy Bob Thornton ""All the Pretty Horses"" is an elegiac visually hypnotic film about love honor reverence for nature and the loss of tradition. When it opens soon after the end of World War II John Grady is crushed to learn that his mother has sold off the West Texas family ranch that he had hoped to work all his life. Craving escape and adventure he sets off on horseback for Mexico with Rawlins encounters a 13-year-old horse thief (Lucas Black) and falls in love with Alejandra (Penelope Cruz) the beautiful daughter of the Mexican landowner (Ruben Blades) who hires him to break wild horses. John Grady is jailed on trumped-up charges nearly loses his life and ultimately learns a sad but important lesson. Damon is an excellent actor and he plays John Grady with an earnestness simplicity and boyish modesty that match his character perfectly. From the easy way he has with a horse to his interplay with his buddy Rawlins to the cadences and timbre of his West Texas accent hes never less than true. Best of all are Damons scenes with Cruz -- at a community dance embracing in a moonlit pond -- which are some of the most lusciously romantic in memory. Its said that Damon and Cruz became involved during the making of the film which is evident onscreen That kind of chemistry cant be faked. Thornton took enormous pains to shoot ""All the Pretty Horses"" and went into months of delays as he refined and retooled the film in post-production. His dedication shows in the elegant choreography of Barry Markowitzs images the smooth editing the subtle performances and the blending of picture and music. But ""All the Pretty Horses"" falls short in the story department. Its never clear what exactly the Lucas Black character has done or why John Grady is blamed for it. The movie also comes to an abrupt shift at midpoint when John Gradys blooming romance with Alejandra is aborted and hes taken away from the hacienda to a Mexican jail. Granted the story requires John Grady to reconcile his passion with the restrictive social codes of a culture he doesnt know and to find his nemesis in Alejandras aunt (Miriam Colon) a harsh imperious matriarch who doesnt want her nieces reputation soiled. Its part of the films theme of freedom in collision with tradition and yet one cant help but feel cheated when those love scenes are cut off. Colon who was also very good in John Sayles ""Lonestar"" gives a menacing authority to her scenes. Shes terrific as are Black as the kid with the loose screw Thomas as the stalwart best friend and Cruz as a woman caught in the unyielding grip of Catholic propriety. ""All the Pretty Horses"" is slow and languid sometimes to the point of passivity and is disappointing in the muddiness of certain plot points. Its a visual feast though and a chance to see Damon an actor whose talents are frequently obscured by his looks and his celebrity deliver his best work.

(Van Redin/Miramax) Youve got your scope and your sweep if youre writing an epic novel like ""All the Pretty Horses."" But scope and sweep are the first casualties in Billy Bob Thorntons movie of the same name - the one that stars Matt Damon Penelope Cruz and a whole herd of great-looking horses. All right maybe theres a teeny bit of both. You cant miss with gorgeous John Ford-size vistas of Mexico and Texas. And theres a sense of entering a unique world when Damons character finds himself stuck (apparently forever) in a crowded Mexican jail. Holy ""Papillon"" and all that. But essentially the Samp;S content seems rationed in this movie. The reason is simple Theres not enough time to evoke a book like this. (They should have called this ""Some of the Pretty Horses."") Reportedly director Thornton had to hack this thing down from four hours to two. And if thats true it certainly shows. The essential problem here These cowboys have to ride shoot and live between three-dot ellipses. This is a shame not only because a good book doesnt get its due but because ""Pretty Horses""-the-movie has some very good moments. Thornton writer-director of the superb ""Slingblade"" has a gift for depicting down-and-dirty scenes among men. And when our three principal characters - three cowboys looking for fortune - go riding from Texas to Mexico this is the best part of the movie. Damon plays John Grady Cole a Texan whos forced to find a new life when his mother sells the family ranch. Hooking up with best friend Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) he decides to find fortune south of the border. Along the way the friends run into Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black) a strange teenager whos after some indefinable fortune too. ""Just what in the hell would we want you with us for?"" Rawlins asks. ""Coz Im an American"" says the kid. Despite Rawlinss misgivings the three cross the Rio Grande and ride into inevitable trouble. The problems start with Blevins who becomes almost psychotically obsessed with regaining his gun when its stolen from him; they continue when Cole meets and falls in love with Alejandra (Cruz) the fetching daughter of a wealthy horse owner named Rocha (Ruben Blades). Despite gaining Rochas confidence and trust as a horse breaker Cole (who with Rawlins is working for Rocha) cannot fight his passion. When they become aware of the romance Alejandras relatives take decisive action. Meanwhile Blevins who was separated from Cole and Rawlins returns to their lives to cause even more trouble. The movie which screenwriter Ted ""Silence of the Lambs"" Tally adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel becomes very episodic and chopped up at this point as if the filmmakers realized they had only so much time left. That stay in a Mexican jail goes by faster than any jailbird could reasonably hope for. And the romance - the essential part of the movie - doesnt exactly take its sweet time. Our marquee headliners meet bat eyes at each other dance skinny-dip in the moonlight and tumble into bed faster than you can say ""Whoa Cruz sure is beautiful."" In fact ""whoa"" seems to be the operating principle. As in Stop that scene before it takes up any more time weve got more book to get through. This is too bad because what we do see of this movie isnt bad at all. Thornton does have a sensual feel for this world. And theres a lovely scene in which Cole breaks horses while Mexican women and children watch with admiration. Its wonderfully edited and cinematographer Barry Markowitzs images of those noble wild restless horses are exquisite. But like those seething tethered creatures this movie is too corralled to gallop across the open prairie of our fancy. ""All the Pretty Horses"" (PG-13 135 minutes) - Contains sexual scenes and violence.

Neither dull nor exciting this long-in-the-works tale of two Texas boys who get all the trouble they can handle down Mexico way boasts a faithful script by Ted Tally that is under-served by director Billy Bob Thorntons lack of a coherent visual style and inability to catch a proper rhythm.

A modest B.O. ride is the best that can be expected. ""All the Pretty Horses"" is a half-broken adaptation of Cormac McCarthys great modern Western novel. Neither dull nor exciting this long-in-the-works tale of two Texas boys who get all the trouble they can handle down Mexico way boasts a faithful script by Ted Tally that is under-served by director Billy Bob Thorntons lack of a coherent visual style and inability to catch a proper rhythm. Nor will it help the commercial prospects for this domestic Miramax release that there was more chemistry between Matt Damon and his golf balls in ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" than there is here between the star and leading lady Penelope Cruz. A modest B.O. ride is the best that can be expected. Originally bought by Columbia for director Mike Nichols project eventually made its way to Thornton and during protracted post-production flip-flopped to Miramax for U.S. distribution with Sony taking over foreign where prospects might be marginally brighter due to Cruzs name and possible lingering fascination with the American West. In period and setting pic is most reminiscent among recent titles of Stephen Frears 1998 postwar quasi-noir ""The Hi-Lo Country"" which is not a good thing although ""Pretty Horses"" has the benefit of a familiar title and higher-profile talent. All the necessary exposition is quickly disposed of under the opening credits With his grandfathers death in 1949 young John Grady Cole (Damon) suddenly finds himself without a home or a future the vast family ranch he expected to work the rest of his life having suddenly been sold out from under him by his absent mother. Deciding that Texas is ""played out"" Cole and his best buddy Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) ride for Mexico where they figure they can find work as top hands and live the life of ""real cowboys"" that they have always imagined was their destiny. For a youngster (late teens in the novel) Cole is quite self-possessed not to mention capable in all things cowboy; next to him the more pallid Rawlins while a boon companion seems more the hired hand. No sooner have they set off on their trek than they run into Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black the boy from ""Sling Blade"") an uncouth but cocky 16-year-old who is riding a horse so fine they have to suspect it is stolen. Thorntons botched presentation of the first big scene among the trio is suggestive of the problems that plague the entire film. Sitting at some distance from one another among rocks Cole and Rawlins begin to tease the boy in laconic threatening tones about how they just might have to kill him and take his horse. Eventually Blevins catches on that theyre just kidding but it takes a while. To build the desired deadpan tension to the point of meaningful release and eruptive humor this dialogue should have been delivered in a measured manner with beats in between but Thornton rushes his actors through it to scant effect. Nor does he even give the viewer a good look at the horse. And so it goes as the film hopscotches from one condensed scene from the book to another without ever sweeping one up in the journey or tapping into the mother lode of rich comedy that exists in McCarthys brilliant dialogue good chunks of which have been wisely retained by Tally. Splitting off from Blevins after the kid dubiously ""steals"" back the horse he lost during a lightning storm Cole and Rawlins hire on as hands at the lavish ranch of the aristocratic Rocha (Ruben Blades) whose saucy daughter Alejandra (Cruz) immediately gives Cole the eye. Pierced through the heart even after one of the most uneventful courtship scenes in memory (one that climaxes with the awkward would-be lovers rubbing their respective shnozzes and commenting about having something up their noses) Cole ignores the friendship hes cemented with Rocha the dictates of Alejandras watchful aunt Alfonsa (Miriam Colon) and Alejandras need to retain her reputation by bedding down with the sultry senorita who seems to have never before met a man who wanted her enough to defy her father. But no one can doubt that there will be a price to pay. Cole and Rawlins are hauled off to a rural jail where they encounter of all people Blevins whos in for horse thieving and murder. Interrogated but spared Blevins dismal fate the pair are transferred to a squalid Mexican penitentiary where they receive the sort of treatment no doubt specially reserved for good-looking young gringos. But after proving his manhood in a prison fight that has more flair than any other scene in the picture Cole is released and against Rawlins advice returns for a final reckoning with Alejandra. Given that Tallys screenplay capably covers the basics of the book -- it respects the language and structure and is alert to the main themes pertaining to the essence of ones character coming of age and Coles search for a father figure -- the films greatest flaw is Thorntons and cinematographer Barry Markowitzs failure to establish a stylistic correlative to McCarthys spare raw prose. The films look ranges as far afield as do the characters from wide-angle exaggerations and heavily filtered nature shots to repetitive closeups and stately landscapes. For a Western especially the compositions are uninventive and uninteresting making for a not particularly attractive film. Damon is responsive to the physical and attitudinal demands of the leading role but he just doesnt quite seem like a young man whos spent his life amidst the dust and dung of a Texas cattle ranch. Nor does he strike any sparks with Cruz the dark Iberian beauty who still hasnt registered in English with the effectiveness that she does in her Spanish films; here her range extends from come-hither looks to tearful remorse. Thomas is OK as Rawlins but young Black is the actor here who best captures the dialect and cadences of cowboy speech. Most of the other supporting thesps are in for just brief appearances in this episodic yarn. Sally Menkes muscular editing moves things along at a rapid clip which may or may not reflect Thorntons intention while Marty Stuarts score is evocative at times intrusive at others. For the record ""Pretty Horses"" reps Thorntons third outing as a director; his second ""Daddy and Them"" has yet to be released.
