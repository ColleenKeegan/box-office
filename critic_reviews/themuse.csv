More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Starring Albert Brooks Sharon Stone Andie MacDowell and Jeff Bridges. Directed by Albert Brooks. Written by Albert Brooks and Monica Johnson. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Movies about Hollywood rarely work -- not because the subject isnt interesting to us but because the movie is usually an occasion to gripe and moan. ""Poor me"" these films tend to say. ""I work in cutthroat Hollywood and I want my dignity back."" Considering what we know about movie-industry salaries its hard to generate much sympathy. So these artists suffered for those luxury SUVs and hillside dream homes -- this is a tragedy? That was the problem with James L. Brooks ""Ill Do Anything"" and its part of the problem with ""The Muse"" an Albert Brooks comedy that opens today. Apparently inspired by his experience as a screenwriter and director ""The Muse"" tells the story of Steven Phillips (Brooks) a once-esteemed writer who cant sell his latest script. ""Youve lost your edge"" a smug much-younger studio executive tells him over lunch. ""People think youre past your prime."" Brooks who co-wrote his film with longtime collaborator Monica Johnson draws a bead on the doublespeak insincerity and snob-driven hierarchies of Hollywood and delivers ""The Muse"" like a silver bullet to the nincompoops who run the asylum. But as charming as he is in his chump-against-the-windmills persona his movie is largely an insiders joke. ""The Muse"" picks up when Brooks character has seen his career nose-dive in one weeks time and unloads his desperation to a writer friend played by Jeff Bridges. Reluctantly Bridges tells Brooks about the real-life muse -- an embodiment of the mythological inspiration for poets -- who helped him write his last script. The muse is Sarah a pretty take-charge woman who dresses in Tinkerbell greens blues and purples and is played by Sharon Stone. Shell take on Brooks as a client she says as long as he pampers her runs her errands and sets her up in a 1700-per-night suite at the posh Four Seasons hotel. What follows is another version of the baby-sitter- from-hell roommate-from-hell neighbor-from-hell movies that turn annoying personalities into figures of entertainment. Sarah not only wraps Phillips and his wife (Andie MacDowell) around her little finger but she seems to hold all of Hollywood James Cameron and Martin Scorsese included in her thrall as well. Stone whose comic flair has rarely been used is amusing and more often downright scary as Brooks demanding narcissistic muse. In Brooks not-so- preposterous script shes a monster supreme -- a metaphor for all underqualified pip-squeaks who pull the strings of Hollywood. ""The Muse"" might have worked better if it didnt presume that were all as interested in the machinations of Hollywood as Brooks is. The world he portrays of Spago and power lunches and battles over screen credits is ripe for satire but ultimately never seems important enough. Its a rarefied realm that Brooks and his fellow film professionals inhabit -- so lofty and privileged it seems that its citizens tend to forget how different their concerns are from the rest of ours. ..

Brooks seems to think that hes walking the high wire of self-scrutiny by playing Steven Phillips a veteran screenwriter who is told out of the blue that he has lost his ""edge."" The early minutes show delicious promise especially when Steven has lunch with a young Paramount executive who as played (expertly) by Mark Feuerstein is a study in bankrupt micro-duplicity. On the spot he terminates Stevens three-picture deal and the more Steven tries to recover from this fall the more he learns that everyone in the business thinks hes washed-up. Theres only one thing that can save him. A secret weapon - the best-kept one in Hollywood. A muse Not just any muse either but the one and only Sarah (Sharon Stone) an itinerant platinum-haired princess who hires herself out to creatively blocked individuals. As legend has it shes the daughter of Zeus himself and the demand for her services is great indeed. Even more intense are the demands she makes on her clients who include James Cameron Rob Reiner and Martin Scorsese (in cutesy cameos). Everyone who enlists Sarahs services is required to shower her with trinkets from Tiffany and Steven also learns that hes got to rent her a 1700-a-day suite at the Four Seasons provide round-the-clock car and room service and generally act as her manservant. Stone plays this earthly deity with maximum cold-fish practicality. Her every hip swagger says ""Youre nothing to me"" If this sounds like a bizarre form of creative therapy it does have a precedent (remember the abuse chic of est?) and Steven under Sarahs tutelage begins to bloom. The script he coughs up is a summer comedy about a guy who inherits a malfunctioning aquarium (are you laughing yet?). More than that its entire concept hinges on the hope that Jim Carrey may sign on. If anything this sounds like an even worse idea for a movie than ""Chubby Rain"" in ""Bowfinger."" Yet watching ""The Muse"" it remains utterly foggy what Brooks satirical slant is toward Steven his muse therapy or his script. Is our hero meant to be a failed hack or a failed artist? And if the screenplay he writes is this dumb what does it mean for Steven to get his mojo back in the first place? Brooks as always skewers fantasies of success but here he does it so completely on Hollywoods corrupt terms that he all but deep-sixes his central gag. It seems that Brooks just wants to celebrate the wacky poetic justice of a crass gold digger inspiring men and women to make more gold. Id say that hed lost his edge if I were even sure he still had his center.

"The Muse (PG-13) The Muse Inspired Comedy By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 27 1999 Sharon Stone as the face that launched a thousand scripts. (October) Director Albert Brooks Cast Albert Brooks; Sharon Stone; Andie MacDowell; Jeff Bridges; Mark Feuerstein; Steven Wright; Lorenzo Lamas; Wolfgang Puck; Rob Reiner; Martin Scorsese; Cybill Shepherd; Jennifer Tilly Running Time 1 hour 37 minutes Contains mild sexual situations and language and momentary nudity You remember the muses those nine mythic daughters of Zeus whose breathy suggestions have inspired artists for all eternity. Well in Albert Brookss hilarious ""The Muse"" they appear to have migrated to Hollywood. One of them has anyway. Shes beautiful sexy and can talk ""character arc"" or ""denouement"" with the best of them. Her extremely satisfied clients include James Cameron Rob Reiner and Martin Scorsese. She doesnt come cheap this one. But she guarantees success to anyone smart enough to buy her poolside services. So far Sharon Stone has a perfect track record. Thats right Sharon Stone. Sure her fictional name in this comedy is Sarah. But nobodys fooling nobody. Thats Stone playing herself - or the idea of herself. And when professional screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) learns his career is on the ropes its just a matter of time before he too finds himself knocking on Sarahs door. Steven gets the bad word from Josh (Mark Feuerstein) a slimy studio executive who drops the scriptwriters contract because he has lost his ""edge."" For Steven this pronouncement is tantamount to contracting bubonic plague. Word will get around of this contagion. He has to act fast. Desperate for help he appeals to his successful scriptwriter-friend Jack (Jeff Bridges) who reluctantly lets him in on the Sarah thing. Steven persuades Jack to get him an audience with Hollywoods most exclusive muse. Bearing an expensive Tiffanys gift as directed by Jack Steven meets the Muse Herself. When she agrees to take him on Stevens joy soon turns into misery. As Sarah coolly informs him she doesnt actually do any work. She simply inspires. Which is going to cost. Her living expenses include room and board at the Four Seasons a chauffeur and someone wholl cater to her every whim 24 hours a day - whether she needs a Waldorf Salad or bobby pins. Hey it worked for ""Titanic."" This takes some explaining at Stevens home. His wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) is understandably skeptical. But eventually she figures this is Stevens career. Gotta go with the program. Things get even more interesting when - in a cost-cutting measure - Steven brings her home. Not only does Sarah make even more demands than before she seems to be having more inspirational effect on Laura than Steven. As always Brookss marvelously forlorn perspective - that the world may think its normal but is in fact completely crazy - sparks comedy at every turn. Whether hes listening aghast to Joshs moronic platitudes or jumping through Sarahs never-ending hoops or simply trying to understand the looking-glass reality of Tinseltown hes a font of pithy complaint - all of it funny. lt; When he meets with Josh for instance Steven learns at the gates that he has been granted a ""walk-on"" pass to the studio meaning he has to park miles away and hump his way to Joshs office. The best pass the guard tells him is a ""drive-on"" which grants parking access. Whats the worst pass you can get Steven wonders aloud a crawl-on? As the sweating miserable Steven walks from isolated building to building searching for Joshs office a sight-seeing bus passes. ""On your left"" crackles the tour guide ""is obviously a man who did not get a drive-on."" The list of great moments is virtually endless Stevens observation that scriptwriters are like eunuchs except that eunuchs get to watch and scriptwriters arent even invited to the set. Or the ""Whos on First?""-style routine when Steven tries to explain his profession to a Beverly Hills partygoer for whom English is definitely a second language. Its tempting to reel them off but that would be like giving you a ""drive-on."" This movie is definitely a pleasure to walk through yourself every amusing step of the way.

Albert Brooks enjoyed the considerable if not quite undivided attention of his own muse on ""The Muse"" a beguiling but erratic rumination on the creative process Hollywood style. Typically fresh and idiosyncratic in the writing but often flat directorially the comic auteurs sixth feature has plenty to offer his usual fan base but its constipated hero relatively cerebral concerns and sedate style will restrict its commercial potential to sophisticated upscale audiences. Brooks confronts that perennial hobgoblin writers block and wittily connects it not only to worries associated with the film industry (the fears of being uncommercial out of the loop old hat or just plain old) but also to the ancient Greek source of inspiration who can prove whimsical as to when and to whom she bestows her favors. And its entirely fitting that the muse that appears to inspire half the towns most successful artists is beautiful charming petty capricious demanding inscrutable unpredictable exciting and quite possibly crazy. Brooks fictional alter ego mainstream screenwriter Steven Phillips finds hes in desperate need of an artistic boost upon being told by a brazen young Paramount executive (a superbly weaselly Mark Feuerstein) that hes lost his ""edge"" and oh by the way please be off the lot by 5 p.m. Suddenly unemployable Steven shortly spots his close friend the hugely successful writer Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges) consorting with a beautiful blonde and learns that this woman Sarah (Sharon Stone) is one of the nine daughters of Zeus and is in cahoots with many of the top names in showbiz. Setup scenes possess a deliciously knowing air as they indelibly nail the many varieties of insults and ego blows at which Hollywood excels -- the brush-offs from studio-gate guards and power players (Stevens trip to Universal for an anticipated meeting with Steven Spielberg is mini-classic) empty advice from agents the feeling that everyone else is privy to a secret that for some reason they dont want you to know. Stevens sense of despair and paranoia is naturally increased by the discovery that there is a discreet society of filmmakers who receive their inspiration from Sarah. Delighted to be accepted into the fold hes soon taken aback by Sarahs requirements of expensive gifts a 1700-per-night suite at the Four Seasons and round-the-clock availability as well as by the news that she doesnt write she only inspires. Like a demanding kept woman Sarah treats her new benefactor like an errand boy and threatens to break him financially while also dispensing just enough creative tidbits to get Steven working on a new screenplay. Stevens well-groomed wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) is naturally suspicious of the latenight phone calls and visits until Sarah takes Laura under her wing and with the crucial intervention of Wolfgang Puck helps launch her on an enormously successful career making gourmet cookies. Although the story achieves a momentum of its own once these dynamics are put in gear Stevens moping and constant complaining eventually become a drag especially when he continues to pooh-pooh his wifes aspirations. By the time Sarah achieves so much sway over Laura that shes moved into the house and has dislodged Steven from his marital bed the mans become a stifled spineless pushover albeit one with a script in need only of a third act. As Steven forlornly observes ""This is like The Muse Who Came to Dinner. "" Of course the spotlight must eventually fall upon Sarah herself. Who is this woman who receives urgent visits from (in amusing cameos) James Cameron and Martin Scorsese? Where does she come from? Could she actually be a real muse Greek or otherwise? Brooks supplies some passable answers but the comic invention flags a bit in the final reel or so prior to a slapdash wrap-up. Throughout Brooks and Monica Johnsons script and dialogue are dead-on re Hollywood talk and attitudes; a scene at a Spago party at which an exasperated Steven is trapped talking to a Euro who barely understands a word hes saying will ring true to anyone whos spent any time in town. The almost whimsical arbitrariness of success and failure is always implicit and even the over-sophisticated kids the community breeds are deftly captured. But pic is slack stylistically. Playing a sad-sack character Brooks makes him seem weary and heavy on his feet and as a director he would much rather have his actors sit down and gab than stand up and move. Nor is the lensing terribly flattering to the thesps. All the same the actors are clearly having fun. Brooks is more Woody Allenish grumpy than usual but still has the lions share of good lines. Stone playing a woman who could as easily be a pampered self-centered movie star as a mythological creature shows a long-concealed gift for well-timed comedy although this muse seems to be having a perpetual bad hair day. MacDowell is OK as the longtime supportive wife who awakens to an unsuspected destiny while Bridges highlight scene is a hilariously frustrating tennis match that gives new meaning to ""net ball.""
