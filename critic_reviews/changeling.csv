That is not to say that the subject of 78-year-old Clint Eastwoods latest - the moving and true story of a traumatised lone mother (Angelina Jolie) who in late 1920s Los Angeles insists that the son returned to her by police following his kidnap is not hers - doesnt involve themes and elements close to the directors heart. It very much does not least those of struggle against repressive systems intolerable situations or impossible odds a re-appraisal of the depiction of women and others seen as second-class and an unflinching approach to the complexity ironies rituals  and political implications of crime and violence punishment and revenge.But having said that Changeling is for an essentially populist work unexpectedly audacious advancing way beyond the call of duty in all its basic four elements. Firstly as a period-reconstruction costumer it is meticulous to the point of affectionate in its realisation of the lost world of 1928  LA while never allowing such colour to obscure or upstage the human drama. As a police investigative procedural too it mounts a sober credible yet searing critique of the famously corrupt political and law enforcement establishment of the day led by Chief Davis (Colm Feore). And as a variation on the campaigning/woman-in-jeopardy movie it illicits Jolies finest performance to date as the woman Christine Collins who faces her  worst nightmare - the kidnap of her 9-year-old son while a child killer is known to be at work. Jolies task is to show each calibration of her maddening dilemma (at one point she is incarcerated in a mental institution) caught as she is between suspended grief fear isolation anger and - most movingly - her maternal feelings towards the imposter (Devon Conti) in her care. But lastly it is the restrained clarity of Eastwoods exposition throughout this roller-coaster ride that is most impressive. He shows the horrors in the same way he observes Christines courage all the while careful only to allow his sympathies to register by means of the tense and empathetic emotional line he keeps at every stage of his heroines hellish experiences. Its a tough movie but also rewarding and inspiring something of a quiet triumph.

Im not too familiar with Jolies back catalogue in fact Ive usually avoided it but she impressed by this role. But she doesnt blanket the film and there are other roles  in particular John malkovich and the guy who played the captain for the LAPD who comliment the progression of the film.

Angelina Jolie merely adequate covers her mouth with her hands all the time. The moment when she discovers her boy is definitely missing is pathetic she delicately places a gloved hand near her mouth careful not to smudge her lipstick or make up. Same for the asylum hose down scene she emerges again with full make up. Excuse me how vain is this actress?

"Changeling | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; changeling ) Changeling (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Clint Eastwoods Changeling falls into a common trap by trying to do too much it accomplishes too little. If the film feels overstuffed and poorly focused thats because the screenplay credited to Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski attempts to fuse two complex and far-reaching stories into a single movie. The result is that the primary thread which features Angelina Jolie as a crusading mother is bogged down by scenes that are only tangentially related to this aspect of the film. Eventually it becomes clear how the subplot is connected to the main story but the marriage is far from harmonious. And while Straczynski should be commended for remaining reasonably true to the historical record this results in an open-ended conclusion that isnt entirely satisfying. Changeling pulls the viewer into its world with an impressive opening sequence that announces the time and the place 1928 Los Angeles. The film looks so good that its tempting to forgive its missteps solely on the basis of how real everything seems. For a while despite a slant toward melodrama little about the story needs forgiveness. It introduces single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) a floor manager at the PacTel switchboard who dotes on her only son nine-year-old Walter (Gattlin Griffith). She is by all accounts a wonderful mother and he is a fine boy. Then one Saturday Christine comes home to an empty house. Walter is missing. She goes to the police but they inform her that theres nothing they can do until a 24 hour waiting period expires. Eventually they begin working the case but days drag into weeks. Christines cause is taken up by Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) a popular and persuasive radio preacher who rails against the corruption of the Los Angeles police. Then one day Christine receives a visit from Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) who bears news Walter has been found. But the reunion held in front of the press is not the happy one Christine had hoped for. The boy presented to her by the police is not her son and the more vocal she becomes about the mistake the more forcefully the cops push back against her. Told in parallel with Christines story is the account of how Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) visits the Northcott Ranch in search of a juvenile who is in the country illegally from Canada. After the boy is taken into custody he tells a horrifying story about how he and his uncle kidnapped and murdered 20 boys one of whom may have been Walter Collins. This case would become popularly known as ""The Wineville Chicken Coop Murders"" and would become one of the most infamous criminal investigations in Southern California during the late 1920s. The central problem with Changeling is that the lengthy secondary story of Ybarras investigation and the revelations surrounding the serial killer come across as unnecessary appendages rather than important aspects of the story. Every time the movie strays from Christine and her crusade the film loses energy. Theres enough going on with the main character who suffers grief at losing her son goes through a One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest phase and ends up in direct conflict with the police department in a court of a law that the introduction of a murder investigation muddies the waters. Changeling feels long and cluttered because it is long and cluttered. To his credit Eastwood does a good job with Christines story even though it seems anachronistic even for 1928. (She didnt have any photographs of her son or any friends that would vouch for the falseness of the ""replacement?"") It reminds us how much things have changed in less than a century. What was a mystery in 1928 would not be a mystery today. Every questionable identity issue raised in Changeling could be solved by DNA testing. Crime isnt what it used to be. The films central melodrama is presented with flair. Most viewers will be sufficiently engrossed by Christines story to make the Ybarra scenes unwelcome interruptions. Angelina Jolies performance is adequate but far from entrancing. For serious roles she was more impressive in last years A Mighty Heart and her turn in this summers popcorn action flick Wanted represented her as a force of nature. In Changeling she often seems muted and overpowered by the period clothing and amazing production values. Jolie never puts a personal stamp on Christine. The films acting standouts come in secondary parts Jason Butler Harner is a deliciously diabolical and complex serial killer who makes the viewer squirm every time hes on screen and Geoff Pierson dominates scenes as Christines high-profile lawyer. Changeling has the vibe of a ""prestige"" film that doesnt quite live up to expectations. The films pedigree is strong with an Oscar winner at the helm and another Oscar winner in the lead role. The release date suggests that Universal has awards aspirations for the movie. Ultimately however the story is where Changeling fails to gain traction. Its not just that theres too much going on but that much of whats happening has only minimal relevance and detracts from a central story that deserves more attention and screen time. There are also problems with the unresolved ending although admittedly theres not much the filmmakers could do about that since real life didnt provide the kind of closure that would have concluded Changeling with a note of finality. From a purely visual standpoint Changeling can stand alongside any of the great stories about Los Angeles during the early decades of the 20th century (Chinatown in particular comes to mind) but thats where the similarities end. When it comes to storytelling Changeling is strictly mundane.

Changeling (R) Universal (141 min.) Directed by Clint Eastwood. With Angelina Jolie John Malkovich. Opens Friday at theaters in New York. THREE STARS Clint Eastwood knows all about powerful emotions. The cold fire of revenge. The slow smoldering of greed. The unquenchable flames of rage. But theyre nothing measured against a mothers love. Thats the power he puts onscreen in ""Changeling"" -- one womans dedication to her only son. And compared to the courage this heroine shows -- as she all but walks through hell itself in search of her boy when he disappears -- Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name are a couple of cowards. Eastwoods new film as a director is based on a true if mostly forgotten story -- how one night in 1928 single mother Christine Collins came home from work to find her 9-year-old son Walter missing. Five months later the Los Angeles Police Department -- under increasing pressure -- produced the boy and reunited mother and child. Except Christine said there was a problem. This wasnt her child. It was clear to others too -- the boys teacher the boys dentist. But the police stubbornly would not could not admit their mistake. And when Christine loudly kept denying the boy was hers -- and insisting that the police were wasting valuable time by not continuing their search -- they did the only logical thing. They declared her dangerously insane and locked her away. Its an astonishing story and it contains a thrilling performance by Angelina Jolie who takes Christine from quietly capable telephone operator to impassioned advocate to furious mental patient -- and beyond. Its award-worthy work with the same kind of ""Snake Pit"" melodrama that got her an Oscar for ""Girl Interrupted"" and it wont be forgotten this year. Eastwood meanwhile -- typically for an actor-turned-director -- has paid close attention to the supporting performances as well. John Malkovich his old nemesis from ""In the Line of Fire"" gets a rare good-guy part as a crusading minister; Jason Butler Harner in a tremendous movie debut is a loathsome presence as a man with crucial information. The script by J. Michael Stracyznski is less artful. It leaves out the fact that the real-life villain was abetted in his crimes by his mother which would have provided a black shadow to the theme of maternal devotion. And true or not several events -- a nick-of-time intervention a faint into the arms of a suddenly appearing friend -- feel like pure Hollywood. Eastwoods direction can be formulaic too. Its interesting to see him -- particularly after back-to-back war films -- once again exploring strong female characters a longtime interest hes rarely given credit for. But conversely hes too often overpraised for being ""minimalist"" when actually his filmmaking can be merely flat -- the compositions and editing rarely rise above the utilitarian here and his own score is derivative. But none of that detracts from Jolies work. In fact Eastwoods own straightforward directorial reserve ends up only complementing it. This is one movie where the star really is the star. And delivers a performance of which any actress can be truly proud as -- wearing no more armor than a felt cloche warm coat and fresh swipe of lipstick -- she goes to war for her son. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

"Changeling (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Changeling (R)  Fact is this haunting story is enough to make you shudder. Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) tries to prove that the boy in front of her (Devon Conti) is not her son Walter in the new drama from director Clint Eastwood ""Changeling."" Share Print Save to your profile Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald The title of Clint Eastwoods new movie has a vague horror-flick vibe to it and Changeling is in large part a horror film -- a fact-based story built around the notorious Wineville Chickenville Murders in late-1920s California. But the great darkness and evil at the heart of J. Michael Straczynskis script are not intended to make you jump in your seat and laugh nervously in the dark. The horror in Changeling is much deeper and unsettling because its face is banally human and its toll unspeakably tragic. Angelina Jolie stars as Christine Collins a working-class single mother who on April 10 1928 kissed her 9-year-old son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) goodbye and left for her job at the Pacific Telegraph Co. When she got home Walter was nowhere to be found. A phone call to the police resulted in the usual response You must wait 24 hours before filing a missing-persons report. But 24 hours later Walter still wasnt home -- and he remained missing for almost five months until the police inform Christine they have found her son alive and well in Dekalb Ill. But when the train transporting the boy pulls into the station where his mother and hordes of press await Christine is dismayed to discover that the boy is not Walter. And no one believes her. Even in his best films as a director (Unforgiven Million Dollar Baby Mystic River Letters From Iwo Jima) Eastwood has never been one for subtlety Hes an artist who believes emotions should be writ large and plain and what happens to Christine from that point forward sometimes feels a bit overdone as if Eastwood were overplaying his hand while putting the audience through the proverbial wringer. Its only when you see the ultimate intent of Eastwoods goal in Changeling -- which uses a mothers search for her missing son to present a city-wide portrait of corruption scandal and the abuse of power -- that you understand why the film is played at such a high key. Every detail of the movies 1920s production design is impeccable from the bowler hats that cast a perpetual shadow over Jolies eyes to the hustle and bustle of the operator switchboards at her place of employment. The period setting -- arguably one of the most convincing ever put on film -- is essential to Changelings exploration of a power structure steamrolling individual rights and even ruining lives for the sake of salvaging its public image in the press. This story could never happen in quite this way in the present day. But by exploring the past Eastwood illuminates the ways and hows of contemporary corruption and abuse. Changeling is also an engrossing and harrowing police procedural following the work of a detective (superbly played Michael Kelly) who practically stumbles upon a shocking lead that could potentially help Christine find her real son. The plots details are best kept vague since Eastwood has a lot of narrative ground to cover (the movies two hour and 20 minute running time is not an indulgence) and he relies on the audiences lack of familiarity with the case to create suspense. There are some breathtakingly dark moments in Changeling as well as some hauntingly eerie and unsettling ones (including a rendition of Silent Night that simultaneously breaks your heart and makes your skin crawl). If the movie eventually has to resort to caricature and shorthand to resolve the multitude of storylines it sets forth such tricks take nothing away from Jolies moving portrayal of a mothers panicked grief and refusal to relinquish hope even when all signs indicate the worst. The movie has an epic sweep but an intimate personal feel. If Changeling lacks the knockout power of say Million Dollar Baby it proves that Eastwood continues to seek out stories that take him places he hasnt been before -- and the audience along with him.

For five months single mother Christine Collins is distraught over son Walters disappearance. The scandal-plagued L.A.P.D. hopes to turn the tide of public opinion by returning the boy to her at a flashbulb-popping press event. When the strong-willed young mother insists that the boy is not hers the cops label her delusional an unfit mother and lock her away in a mental ward. ""Changeling"" is a brilliant demanding film a mystery-cum-character study about which we finally have to make up our own minds. It employs subject matter familiar from many other films -- serial killings official corruption capital punishment -- in challenging ways requiring us to think beyond our stock responses. It is a tragedy with numerous villains and a story of redemption with several heroes. Its a piercing look at evil in various forms with a central fiend as startling as Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and lesser devils who hide behind badges and medical degrees. Its a hymn to virtue fueled by religious righteousness in some cases and sheer integrity in others. The story is fascinating for many reasons not least because its such a contrast to standard mysteries. ""Changeling"" is directed by Clint Eastwood with a marriage of artistic restraint and emotional clout. He withholds showing us anything overtly disturbing for ages conjuring tension with suggestiveness until repressed feelings erupt. Angelina Jolie is the strong emotional center of the film. Her performance as the distraught mother is so driven so sensitive to the many different facets of a complex personality that we feel an intuitive understanding of her. She is convincingly brave and compellingly frightened. The movie is mostly told from Christines point of view yet it doesnt let her off the hook for the events that led to Walters disappearance. Instead it argues that even a loving mother can make decisions that spiral into tragedy. Jolie makes Christines unspoken feelings of guilt a key to her later tenacity. ""Changeling"" is bleak about the fragility of life without being unwatchably pessimistic. Its impossible to not be impressed by Eastwoods mature craftsmanship. He gives us the look of old Los Angeles its streetcars and flapper fashions and Model Ts but the film wears its period lightly. Observe the way Eastwood blocks scenes patiently letting the camera linger on the actors never cutting until its appropriate. Look at the sensitivity in the scenes between Jolie and the women working in her office. Who would have predicted that Dirty Harry would have the delicacy of feeling to show that supportive sorority enfolding a sister in need? Eastwood keeps the volcanic John Malkovich at a simmer in the role of a crusading radio evangelist who takes up Christines cause his shrill anger venting only when its tactically useful to scare an adversary. When the film travels into frightening territory Eastwood is unflinching. There are horrific moments of bloodshed and equally ghastly official retribution. A monster gets the punishment he deserves but Eastwood doesnt savor his final moments of suffering instead making him an unexpected figure of pity. When this uncanny film is over you feel that you have looked both good and evil in the face. CHANGELING  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for some violent and disturbing content and language.

Its Mother Interrupted - and also an exhaustive inventory of the widespread institutional corruption that engulfs her and destroys innocent lives.First the public relations-challenged LAPD fails Christine and blames her. As does the county mental facility where she is remanded. In Eastwoods Kafkaesque weepie every man in Southern California shows contempt for the phone-company supervisor except a crusading minister (John Malkovich) and an attentive police detective (Michael Kelly) who in investigating an apparently unrelated case sees how it connects to Christines.If films were people Changeling would have multiple-personality disorder. It opens as a 1930s-style potboiler morphs into a 50s-era police corruption saga briefly transforms into a 70s-type horror movie (bloody axes and all) and closes as a generic courtroom drama.While components of Eastwoods film are excellent in particular Kellys quietly tenacious performance and the evocative period details Changeling is a film of parts not a unified whole. With its many tonal shifts and dangling subplots J. Michael Straczynskis sprawling script is a problem. Jolies performance is another.Surely the loveliest and one of the more talented creatures ever to bound before the movie camera Jolie is not the first star whose tabloid notoriety intrudes on the moviegoers ability to view her in character. It is hard very hard to see her as someone other than the homewrecking globetrotting daddy-hating Brad-loving fertile Myrtle Mother Courage of the bedroom eyes and pillow lips.During the early 1960s the moviegoing public felt much the same way about Elizabeth Taylor who in retrospect consistently turned in tremendous performances during that era. Perhaps in 40 years one will be able to appreciate Jolies Christine without the interference of media static.In a film shot mostly in browns Jolies Christine with her turquoise dresses and vermilion lips looks like a garish neon sign in the middle of an otherwise monochromatic affair.Its not only the way Jolie is costumed and made up that throws the movie out of whack. Its the way she doesnt really interact with the other players but is a stoic martyred by authority. Its the way she inhabits her own hermetically sealed space like the Madonna in an old masters altarpiece. When her son disappears doesnt Christine have neighbors or friends she can go to?As Christine is failed by the authorities so Jolie is failed by a screenwriter who fails to dramatize the historical record and a director who indulges his star. (This is unusual for Eastwood who typically favors underplayers.) Jolie sucks the oxygen from each scene. This may be why most of the scenes without her have more flow and life. What an unbelievable story. What an unconvincing performance. Changeling 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Clint Eastwood.

"Movie review Changeling -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Changeling -- 3 out of 5 stars Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) son goes missing. Months later LA police bring her someone claiming to be her boy but he isnt. She challenges the system to keep looking for her son but corrupt police question her sanity and a skeptical public is hungry for a fairy-tale ending. She must find the truth while being slandered as delusional and unfit. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Angelina Jolie  who won her Oscar by playing mentally ill in Girl Interrupted returns to the psyche ward for Clint Eastwoods Changeling a movie he might have titled Motherhood Interrupted. Its a period piece a true-crime mystery and a slice of history vintage Eastwood in many ways. If the film is too long and a little unwieldy in its later acts the consummate craftsman in Eastwood glosses over that with detail and righteous rage.Jolie plays Christina Collins a telephone switchboard supervisor and single mom in 1928 Los Angeles. She has to leave her 9-year-old son Walter home one Saturday when shes called into work. When she gets home hes missing. Months of frantic calls ensue trying to rouse the LAPD into action. A crusading preacher ( John Malkovich ) takes up the cause. A kid turns up in Illinois and is delivered to her and the waiting press corps by a press-savvy police department.""Thats not my son."" ""You must be mistaken"" a pushy cop (Jeffrey Donovan) insists. Its been a few months. The boy has changed. Your memory is playing tricks on you. Besides he adds youre a woman. And you know ""how women are.""As horrific as losing a child is imagine losing one and having the absolute authority and influence of the Los Angeles Police Department determined to ""make this all go away"" by giving you a replacement boy insulting you when you make a fuss sending doctors around to bolster their case and when you wont play ball having you institutionalized.Changeling touches on several favorite Eastwood subjects -- crimes against children in particular. But its worth noting that as good as Jolie is in the lead Eastwood is no Spielberg when it comes to working with kids.The mystery here is deep with layers of meaning built into it. Eastwood gets at psychiatric bullying and gender issues of those dark ages of yore. In casting the always-cagey Malkovich as the preacher who takes on Collins cause he suggests that we question the mans motives that Mrs. Collins might be a pawn in a larger Los Angeles chess match. Changeling is a movie with no shortage of villains starting with the police chief (Colm Feore gaunt and scary). It packages Jolie in flapper attire and red-red lipstick and demands that she cry ""I want my son back"" dozens of times but its still one of her most empathetic roles. Amy Ryan has the ""Angelina Jolie"" role in this Interrupted mental hospital the patient in a similar fix the one who explains this nightmare of powerlessness to the new inmate.But like the similar Mystic River Changeling is a film without the urgency that the subject demands. Eastwood flatly lays out the criminal case that may be linked to Walters disappearance and takes his own sweet time doing it. He can deliver chilling murders and hangings but when he sets out to unravel the whole affair the ""eureka"" moments dont have the proper kick.Changeling is fascinating high-minded and ambitious story with twists and turns and implications far beyond the ""true crime"" origins of the tale. That it isnt the emotional surprising and engrossing Oscar contender Eastwood set out to make is one of the bigger disappointments of the fall.

Clint Eastwoods direction in this story of a woman whose son goes missing is typically taut (even in a film that runs well over two hours) and Angelina Jolie acts for everything shes worth. Its all very serious very grim very worthy. Based on a true story Changeling stars Jolie as Christine Collins a single mother in the 1920s who works as a telephone operator. While shes at work one day her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) disappears. Shes devastated of course - and then thrilled when five months later the Los Angeles Police Department announces Walter has turned up. Its a public-relations coup for the LAPD which is under constant battering by the Rev. Gustav Briegeb (John Malkovich) who has made it his lifes work to expose corruption in the force. He has no shortage of fodder to keep his sermons and radio broadcasts interesting. A nice happy ending except the police have brought back the wrong boy. The one they have found is 3 inches shorter than Walter and circumcised (Walter is not) - key evidence that Christine is right one might think. But the LAPD personified by the duplicitous Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) wont be denied. Christine is pressured to change her story; when she makes a public fuss (with Briegebs help) Jones responds by locking her up in a harrowing mental institution. From there the film goes in several directions. A string of serial murders comes to light and has an effect on the case. Changeling then becomes a crime film then morphs into dueling courtroom dramas. But for all that Changeling is built around Jolies performance as crucial to the movie as film in the camera. Shes quite good but in many ways its a limited role - she goes from happy to sad to sadder. Yet she does display an incredible resolve in the face of the most dehumanizing attempts on the part of Jones and the doctors in the hospital to dissuade her. Christine is on the side of right of course but the LAPD is so uniformly corrupt and negligent that it serves basically as a straw man. (The staff of the mental hospital is similarly evil almost cartoonishly so.) Only Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) shows any humanity and he keeps it well under wraps. Changeling is a fine-enough movie. Its just that its aware of the fact and neither Eastwood nor Jolie ever lets the audience forget it. Of course the key audience is Oscar voters and its members can always use an easy reminder. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 24 2008 Save for later Saved Nightmare Angelina Jolie plays a single mother whose 9-year-old son suddenly goes missing. Courtesy of Universal Studios          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Clint Eastwoods ""Changeling"" is based on fact but the narrative definitely falls into the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction category.Set for the most part in Los Angeles in 1928 its about a telephone switchboard supervisor and single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) whose 9-year-old son Walter suddenly and mysteriously goes missing. Five months after his disappearance the notoriously corrupt Los Angeles Police Department desperate for good publicity announces Walter has been found. With great photo-op fanfare the boy is brought into the city by train whereupon Christine immediately recognizes that this kid is not her son. ""Take him home on a trial basis"" says Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) wearing his best pasted-on smile.Despite the rather stilted period re-creation and acting this portion of ""Changeling"" is effective and creepy. The police are bogeymen. Forget good cop/bad cop. In the LAPD its all bad cop/bad cop. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? As it moves forward the film becomes more and more outlandish. Even though this is a true story Eastwood doesnt provide a satisfying explanation for its implausibilities. Christine takes the boy home and reports to the police the physical disparities in her ""son"" - hes several inches taller circumcised his teeth and eyes are different his schoolteacher thinks hes an impostor and so on. The police pooh-pooh her objections as the rantings of a distraught mother but why does no one think to ask the boy a few well-chosen questions that only he and Christine know the answers to? Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Changeling Christines chief champion is a radio pastor played by John Malkovich in marcelled hair and lugubrious tones. But before he can rally to her cause she is thrown by the police into the psychopathic ward which Eastwood portrays as a snake pit out of a 40s melodrama. (Amy Ryan stands out as one of the inmates.) By this time ""Changeling"" has morphed into a horror film and not a terribly good one either. Eastwood and his screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski villainize the bad guys especially the police captain to the point of absurdity. In the best movies bad guys are never simply bad - we are always given reasons for why they act the way they do. (Any actor knows that the best way to play a villain is to play him as a hero in his own mind.)In a way Jolies Christine is just as one-dimensional as the cops and the killers that we see. Even before Walter goes missing she seems oddly abstracted from her surroundings. With her cloche hat bright red lipstick and bone-white skin she resembles a mannequin. When she rages against the injustices of the police and becomes a feminist crusader its as if an android had suddenly got religion.Jolie has a tendency in her movies to go all masklike and inscrutable and not just in action vehicles like the ""Lara Croft"" series. But she was wonderfully expressive in ""A Mighty Heart"" where she played Mariane Pearl and I would have thought that some of that woeful gravity would find its way into ""Changeling"" as well. Eastwood must have wanted it this way - icy-hot. If so he miscalculated. Christine is a heroine who would seem right at home in one of those audioanimatronic displays at Disney World.Eastwood is up against some pretty stiff competition here most notably ""Chinatown"" and ""L.A. Confidential."" Unlike the best of his recent work ""Changeling"" seems surprisingly generic. Right on cue big dramatic scenes occur during downpours; furtive faces are shrouded in shadow. Eastwood gets all noirish for us but like Jolies performance theres a rote quality to it all. Even the mournful little ditties that Eastwood composed for the soundtrack seem canned.Its possible that this real-life story which tries to open out into a full-scale view of 20s Los Angeles in all its sociopolitical corruption was too ambitious too Dreiserian for Eastwood. Years ago he starred in a movie about killers bad cops and corrupt politicians called ""Dirty Harry."" Since that time hes become enshrined as an auteur and at 78 hes more than earned the right to be taken seriously. Not so much this time though. This hothouse ""Changeling"" is freeze-dried.

"Fast paised - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Fast paisedOctober 24 2008|By MATT PAISHigh School Musical 3 Senior Year (G)With graduation looming Troy (Zac Efron) wonders if hell go to college for basketball or theater; Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) anticipates heading to Stanford and being away from Troy; and Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) schemes to score a Juilliard scholarship. Meanwhile Chad (Corbin Bleu) Taylor (Monique Coleman) Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) and the rest of the gang prep for prom and put on a musical about their impending life changes.The buzz Complaining that ""HSM"" is corny is like Santa Claus griping about long hours -- it comes with the territory.The verdict Yes half the lyrics would be at home on a Backstreet Boys record and Hudgens looks embarrassed when Gabriellas Troy-inspired swooning reaches new heights of cheeseballitude. But the series has grown up relatively speaking at last providing melodies that split the difference between stage tunes and pop radio as well as dance sequences that mix old-fashioned grace with modern pizzazz. (Efrons star shines the entire way.)Happy-Go-Lucky (R)London schoolteacher Poppy (Sally Hawkins) is full of life which inspires affection from some and skepticism from others. The film follows her as she hangs with her roommate/best friend (Alexis Zegerman) takes driving lessons from an angry teacher (Eddie Marsan) flirts with a social worker (Samuel Roukin) goes out drinking takes a dance class and chats with her sisters.The buzz This is a much much less gloomy affair than writer-director Mike Leighs last film 2004s ""Vera Drake"" and ""Happy"" is a particularly strange one in that theres barely any plot to summarize. Rather than serving as a film for people who want a clear conflict and resolution its a snapshot of one woman how she interacts with those around her and how they react to her.The verdict Prepare to have your batteries recharged. Absolutely extraordinary in its grounded optimism ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" features an Oscar-worthy performance from Hawkins that cannot be ignored. With the slightest grin or clench of the eyes Hawkins reveals exactly what makes Poppy tick in a way that feels like you know everything about her without actually knowing much at all. matt pais is metromix movies producer.ALSO OUT FRIDAY- ""Changeling"" See Pages 30-31- ""Pride and Glory"" See Page 35- ""Saw V"" did not screen for critics but go to metromix.com Friday afternoon for Matt Pais review of the film.- ""Passengers"" did not screen for critics.QUICK TAKEFilth and Wisdom (R)""The best part of Filth and Wisdom Madonnas (right) directorial debut is that its only 81 minutes long.

Forster urged famously in his novel ""Howards End."" The injunction couldnt be more relevant to Clint Eastwoods ""Changeling"" a period drama set in Los Angeles in the late 1920s. Connections are missing or scrambled between the filmmaking and the period between the co-stars Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich and between the characters they play. ENLARGE Angelina Jolie stars in Clint Eastwoods Changeling Universal Pictures A true story provided the films premise. In 1928 a telephone operator and single mother named Christine Collins came home from work to find that her nine-year-old son had been kidnapped. Months later the L.A.P.D. under pressure to solve the case claimed to have found him but the child they produced was not her son. When Collins refused to agree that he was she was committed to a psychiatric hospital where she languished for days until the boy admitted to the police that he was an impostor. It was a bizarre case with grave ramifications -- systemic police corruption the discovery of a mass murder and a mothers steadfast belief that her child might still be alive. As often happens in such films historical fact has been rearranged and conflated with half-truths and dramatic inventions. That would barely qualify as a misdemeanor if the results achieved their own integrity but J. Michael Straczynskis disjointed script manages to ring false at almost every significant turn (Collins psychiatric-hospital stay has grown into a latter-day version of ""The Snake Pit"") and Clint Eastwoods ponderous direction -- a disheartening departure from his sure touch in ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" -- magnifies the flaws. Angelina Jolie her eyes like coal nuggets circumscribed by mascara and her lips slathered with fire-red lipstick certainly makes Christine a strong presence if often a harsh one; shes so assertive that even her demure seems pushy. John Malkovich as a radio evangelist who takes up Christines cause -- the character Gustav Briegleb has a factual basis -- plays the cards dealt him by the script but its not a winning hand. This Briegleb is a device just as Christine is a bloodless construction; they intersect at crucial moments but dont really interact. (Hes also a telepathic device thanks to a continuity glitch that gives him knowledge of Christines categorical rejection of the young impostor before she has made it public.) ENLARGE Angelina Jolie The clumsy dialogue and stolid performances in secondary roles deserve one another; an exception is a showy but genuinely creepy performance by Jason Butler Harner as the psychotically jovial mass murderer. The story abounds in anachronism both verbal and dramatic People didnt talk about self-esteem in the 1920s; they didnt call groups of reporters ""the press""; the phrase ""begs the question"" meant ""evades the question"" exactly the opposite of what it means today; and women like Christine simply didnt behave as she does in an outlandish climax however much Angelina Jolie may have wanted to cross Ida Lupino with Erin Brockovich. Tom Sterns camera sees 1920s Los Angeles in cool colors that keep verging on black and white but his restrained palette only emphasizes the movies narrow emotional spectrum. ""Changeling"" sees the past as a remote country inhabited by outsize characters playing big scenes. Ive Loved You So Long Its a shock to see Kristin Scott Thomas in the first shot of ""Ive Loved You So Long."" She is bleakness personified and its not the sort of pretend bleakness that makeup and lighting can bestow on a beautiful face. She looks hollow haunted incompletely there at an empty table in an empty airport lounge where there isnt much there to begin with. The woman she plays Juliette has been away spiritually as well as physically for many years and the drama is mainly about her struggle to reclaim a vital place in the here and now. But Philippe Claudels remarkable French-language debut feature is equally about the thrill of watching a superb actress give a great performance. (Shes bilingual as last summers ""Tell No One"" reminded us.) The game Scott Thomas plays is an intricate one -- keeping us connected to this cold withholding woman during the course of her slow thaw. Better than connected she keeps us enthralled. Until now the writer-director has been known primarily as a novelist. Although a literary sensibility can get in the way of filmmaking this film is all the more fascinating for it even if the script sometimes strays into flagrant contrivance. (And its more distinctive for the music by Jean-Louis Aubert.) The only plot point Ill give away is one that figures prominently in the trailer Juliette has been serving a term in prison. Her first refuge in the outside world is the home of her younger sister Lea a college professor played with singular delicacy by Elsa Zylberstein. But the sisters havent seen one another for 14 years so Juliettes spiritual solitude is intensified by her estrangement from Lea and by hostility from Leas husband who isnt up for a supporting role in Juliettes rehabilitation. In the hands of another filmmaker Juliettes story might have been a familiar one of an ex-offender coming back into the world. But Philippe Claudel gives his heroine unusual depth which Kristin Scott Thomas reveals with unusual passion and he fills the world around her with characters who bespeak a novelists fertile imagination along with a directors ability -- where did all his good cinematic instincts come from? -- to bring those characters to life on the screen. The supporting roles are as vivid in their way as those of the two sisters Serge Hazanavicius as Leas husband Luc; Frederic Pierrot as Juliettes parole officer Captain Faure a poetic soul trapped in a hopeless dream of romantic adventure; Lise Segur as little Lys Juliettes deliciously forthright niece; Mouss Zouheyri as Samir a charming physician transplanted from Iraq; Jean-Claude Arnaud as Papy Paul Lucs mute but eloquent grandfather and most affecting of all Laurent Grevill as Michel the gentle teacher who penetrates Juliettes defenses as if they were no more formidable than the Maginot Line. When Michel calls upstairs to see if shes home and she answers ""Im here"" its a momentous declaration as well as a statement of fact. DVD TIP ENLARGE Everett Collection Another changeling film based on a true story ""The Return of Martin Guerre"" (1982) set in 16th-century France stars Gerard Depardieu as a man who comes home eight years after deserting his wife and child. (Its one of his best roles.) Daniel Vigne directed at a leisurely pace from a script by the estimable and at that time ubiquitous Jean-Claude Carriere who drew from a Janet Lewis novel and the knowledge of a historical consultant Natalie Zemon Davis. (She later wrote an absorbing reconstruction of the actual event.) The changeling mystery plays an important but not dominant part in the story which explores the ironies of happiness under false colors Martin Guerres wife played by Nathalie Baye finds gratifying changes in her man whether or not hes the man he claims to be. A far less felicitous English-language remake ""Sommersby"" (1993) was set in the South following the Civil War with the husband and wife played by Richard Gere and Jodie Foster.

ABOUT THE MOVIEChangeling  1/2 (out of four)Stars Angelina Jolie John Malkovich Jeffrey Donovan Michael Kelly Amy RyanDirector Clint EastwoodDistributor Universal PicturesRating R for some violent and disturbing content and languageRunning time 2 hours 21 minutesOpens Friday in select cities WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Playing the anguished mother of a missing child Angelina Jolie is incarcerated in a mental hospital in a key dramatic sequence of Changeling. This stately-looking film directed by Clint Eastwood and based on actual events could also have been called Mom Interrupted. It is above all a story about the unflagging determination of an ordinary woman Christine Collins played by Jolie and her quest to find her 9-year-old son. But while her tenacity in the face of overwhelming odds is undeniably admirable the way it plays out is not always compelling. The methodical storytelling leads to flat and even tedious stretches. Parts of the story mirrored by Jolies performance are so calm they seem almost monotonous. PHOTOS Check out our Changeling gallery The real-life story lends itself well to cinematic adaptation. On a sunny day in 1928 Christine a telephone company supervisor and single mother returns from work to find her young son Walter has vanished. Its a parents worst nightmare and Christine does all she can to find him. Then after five months of lackluster searching Los Angeles police announce theyve solved the case. The saga seems a public relations dream for an embattled police department. But the boy who officials identify as Walter is not her son Christine insists. The more she persists the more the police dig in. Leery of bad publicity they dismiss her as a hysterical and unfit mother. Police Capt. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) might as well have twirled his mustache as he villainously confines her to a psychiatric hospital. Christine seems to have only one ally a radio preacher named Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). They expose the LAPDs bullying. Meanwhile a horrific serial murder case comes to light and the police look worse than ever. Changeling is a provocative period piece handsomely wrought. Production designer James J. Murakami does a consummate job re-creating Prohibition-era Los Angeles. The film adheres fairly closely to historical accounts though some details are modified particularly those pertaining to serial killer Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner). But key characters lack dimension particularly Capt. Jones and Christine. He has no redeeming qualities and she has no flaws. Its as if Eastwood forgot to give her a personality. Instead he calls for repetitive and unrevealing close-ups of her suffering face. Her lack of affect is punctuated by regular outbursts of ""Hes not my son"" While the neo-Gothic tale is inherently intriguing the film should inspire strong emotion but deliberate pacing and a contained sense of melodrama make it a surprisingly passive experience.

"Changeling An emotional motherlode | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentChangeling An emotional motherlodeClint Eastwood wants us to know his film is based on the truth but some aspects of Changeling are so hard to fathom the movie seems like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone.Angelina Jolie conveys the rage and fear of a parent who has lost a child in Changeling heightened by womens powerlessness of the time.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 24 2008 Changeling (out of four)Starring Angelina Jolie John Malkovich Jeffrey Donovan Jason Butler Harner Michael Kelly and Amy Ryan. Directed by Clint Eastwood. 140 minutes. At the Varsity Varsity VIP. 14A The words ""a true story"" flash tersely on screen at the start of Changeling Clint Eastwoods chilling new child-swap drama starring Angelina Jolie.Eastwood ever concise wants us to know his film isnt just based on the truth as per the usual Hollywood fudging; it is the truth near as he can tell it in a 2 1/2-hour movie. Wikipedia confirms the details of the Depression-era Los Angeles case known as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders which screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski has stuck to in the main.Such exactness is worth noting because the actions and attitudes in Changeling are so hard to fathom the movie seems like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. You almost expect to see the ghost of Rod Serling amble into the frame puffing on a smoke as he intones ""You are entering another dimension ...""This dimension begins in L.A. on March 10 1928 when single mom Christine Collins (Jolie) tells her 9-year-old son Walter she must leave him alone at home for the day so she can do a fill-in shift for her job of supervising telephoning operators.She returns to find Walter unexpectedly gone and fears for his safety. When she finally persuades skeptical police to search for him the trail has gone cold - and remains that way until that July when a boy matching Walters description turns up in Illinois in the company of drifter.It looks like a happy ending to a tragic kidnapping case. Its also a public relations bonanza for the Los Angeles Police Department which has been taking heat over allegations of corruption and incompetence. But when the mother-and-child reunion is orchestrated under the glare of popping newspaper photographers flashbulbs Christine makes a terrible discovery the boy claiming to be Walter isnt her son.The above plot details and the title that refers to ancient legend of switched babies shouldnt be construed as spoilers. The real drama isnt in the questioning of the childs identity (although the physical resemblance is close enough to keep us wondering) but rather in the patronizing reaction of male-dominated authorities to Christines insistence that a mother knows her own child. Changeling emphatically returns us to a time not all that long ago when men were not only presumed to know better than women they also had the force of law behind that presumption. LAPD captain J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) tells Christine her mind is playing tricks from stress. A doctor hired by the police arrives at the same conclusion. When Christine pursues the matter demanding the police relaunch the hunt for Walter Jones accuses her of attempting to shirk her motherly duties to the boy now in her care ""Youre a liar and a troublemaker"" he shouts.Christine finds an ally in Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) a Presbyterian minister and radio preacher whose antipathy toward the LAPD is vocal and frequent. He vows to help her but hes considered a biased source - and how can one woman and one man take on an entire police force especially when the LAPD takes action to silence her?This is familiar ground for Eastwood who plumbed similar emotional depths with Mystic River five years ago and whose resistance to blind authority has been well documented both on and off the screen.Hes found a kindred spirit in Jolie no mild mama herself who effectively channels the rage and fear any parent would feel at the thought of losing a child. Her Christine may dress like a Roaring Twenties flapper and identify with Claudette Colberts impetuous heiress in It Happened One Night but shes not the loose woman the cops seem to think she is. She struggles to remain a lady in situations that would test the patience of Job.Malkovich gets considerably less screen time than Jolie but he makes an impact regardless. The same goes for Amy Ryan as Christines loyal cellmate Colm Feore as the LAPDs embattled police chief Michael Kelly as a dogged police detective and Jason Butler Harner as a figure of mystery and menace.Eastwood assumes we know the tenor of the times he mounts so effectively and sparingly with desaturated colours and a muted piano score. By the late 1920s the womens suffrage movement had just started in America but it would take many more decades for attitudes about equality to seriously change.There was no Internet searching or DNA testing to assist in a missing-person case. It was also not uncommon for citizens to shelter children who were not their own especially in the aftermath of World War I if a greater good could be met.In other words it might have profited Eastwood to provide greater context and background to events that seem so preposterous in terms of todays laws and attitudes.Many people will leave the theatre believing theyve seen some form of outrageous fiction and yet we have Clints word - and that of historical accounts - that this is indeed a true story.

Angelina Jolie stars as Christine Collins in the provocative drama from director Clint Eastwood ""Changeling."" Photo Tony Rivetti Jr. Universal Pictures Movie review Eastwoods superb Changeling 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Changeling Drama. Starring Angelina Jolie John Malkovich and Jason Butler Harner. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Clint Eastwood is in the midst of one of cinemas most notable late growth spurts. Until he reached his 70s hed been a solid above-average filmmaker with a signature style and a capacity for greatness. But since turning 70 Eastwood has been on a tear with one masterpiece (""Million Dollar Baby"") one near-masterpiece (""Mystic River"") and a project of epic dimensions the mirror-image World War II films ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters From Iwo Jima."" ""Changeling"" maintains Eastwoods creative streak. It might not be as exalted as ""Million Dollar Baby"" but there are things about it that set it apart and make it one of the most enjoyable of his recent films. Its a womans story which is a departure for Eastwood. (Even ""Million Dollar Baby"" was about a woman as seen through the eyes of a man.) And because the story has no built-in aura of significance - because its simply a sad account of something that happened to somebody long ago - Eastwoods abilities stand out in sharper relief. The history doesnt make the movie important. Rather Eastwood makes the history important. He does it by simply taking a really good story and directing it well though in fact theres nothing simple about the artistic intelligence on display here. That intelligence permeates every aspect of the picture and yet the hand is light and if you dont look for it you might not notice it. Tom Sterns cinematography for starters is a thing of subtle beauty. The colors are ever so slightly faded and yet always there will be something in the frame that leaps out - a yellow cab or Angelina Jolies lipstick. The overall effect is to make us aware of color and aware that were seeing an era - the late 1920s and early 1930s - that we know almost entirely in black and white. Were seeing not only history but also a dream of history and that double effect which adds texture to the experience is accomplished gently and lands right on the border of consciousness. Eastwood makes this world so visually appealing and fascinating in its details that we just want to linger there look at Jolie in a cloche and watch her take her son to school on a Los Angeles streetcar. When the story intrudes it feels like an intrusion on our world too A single mother Christine Collins (Jolie) comes home from work to find that her son is missing. Gone. No trace. Vanished. ""Changeling"" is based on a true story but knowing that its true couldnt have made it any easier for Eastwood and the actors to pull off the pivotal scene. After several months Christine is told by the Los Angeles police that her son has been located. Accompanied by a police captain (Jeffrey Donovan) she goes to meet the boy at the train but the boy turns out not to be her son. However news reporters are nearby and the captain not wanting to expose the department to embarrassment insists that the boy is her son. And so for that moment and for the benefit of the press Christine persuades herself that the changeling is the real thing. This is an unlikely turn. Why would a mother choose to believe that a strange boy is her child? The answer is in Jolie and Eastwoods complete understanding of the scenes emotional dynamics. Christine is disoriented. She is disappointed as few have ever been disappointed. She is still in that halfway zone between receiving bad news and not wanting to believe it. And so in that moment of vulnerability she accepts this kid who looks nothing like her child as her son. Thats really where the movie begins. What follows is a harrowing saga in which Christine fights to have her real son found while coming up against the self-protective corrupt police department. The details are best left for you to discover but the story in an incidental way touches on the respective differences in status between men and women in this earlier time. Jolie is a creature of the screen as strange looking as an alien from the planet Movie Star but emotionally ready present and understated. She never grandstands; she just delivers. John Malkovich is very much in the period as a crusading minister/radio personality a fellow who spent most of his life in the 19th century and has the theatricality to prove it. Also not to be overlooked is Jason Butler Harner who plays one of the best movie psychos Ive ever seen - a frightened sniveling wreck whose mind is disintegrating. ""Changeling"" is a disturbing film about grim subject matter but the overall experience is more exhilarating than saddening. Theres just something satisfying about seeing a movie so well made. -- Advisory Very disturbing subject matter strong language and frightening images.

This melodrama would have made a great movie for Bette Davis or Joan Crawford - if the Hollywood studios werent in bed with the LAPD and the story wasnt too disturbing for the 1930s womens movie crowd. Jolie is Christine Collins a single mom whose 9-year-old son Walter disappears one Saturday while shes working an extra shift as a telephone company supervisor. Five months later the scandal-ridden LAPD stages a photo op reuniting Christine with Walter at a train station. Only it isnt Walter but a young imposter the cops pressure her to take home. Christine protests the scam repeatedly to Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) the head of the juvenile investigations unit. When she takes her complaint to the press Jones finally has Christine thrown in the psychiatric ward. Fortunately shes found an ally in the Rev. Briegleb (John Malkovich effectively cast against type) a radio evangelist who has been protesting the LAPDs policy of executing and incarcerating criminals and others it considers embarrassing without such niceties as trials. At the same time Captain Jones is trying to quash an investigation at a chicken ranch where a 15-year-old illegal immigrant from Canada is telling a chilling tale. The teenager (Eddie Alderson very good) says he was forced to help his adult cousin murder around 20 kidnapped youngsters - and identifies Walter as one of the possible victims. The excellent script by J. Michael Straczynski comes hurtling down twin tracks - Jones and his superiors face hearings by the Los Angeles City Council just as the apprehended serial killer Gordon Northcott (scary standout Jason Butler Harner) stands trial across the street. Northcott taunts Christine about Walters fate and she physically confronts him on the eve of his hanging in a scene thats as credulity-straining as it is dramatically satisfying. Sort of a companion piece to ""Chinatown"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" as well as Eastwoods underrated ""A Perfect World"" this gripping film takes great pains to re-create the City of Angels during the early part of the 20th century. Eastwood has peopled it with a terrific cast including Amy Ryan (""Gone Baby Gone"") as a prostitute Christine meets while incarcerated Michael Kelly as an honest detective who defies Jones to investigate the serial killings and a trio of remarkable juvenile performances. Theres Gattlin Griffith as Walter Collins; Devon Conti as his defiant impersonator Arthur Hutchins; and Asher Axe who relates a hard-to-watch flashback in a twisty epilogue set in 1935. Jolies attention-grabbing work here will inevitably be compared with ""A Mighty Heart"" in which she disappeared into the role of Mariane Pearl widow of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Neither woman is a victim but Christine more openly suffers than the stoic Mariane. And Jolie gives a big movie star performance that rivets your attention for nearly 21/2 hours. ""Changeling"" is another remarkable addition to Eastwoods directorial canon. CHANGELING Haunting real-life horror. Running time 140 minutes. Rated R (violence disturbing images profanity).

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 23 2008 125 PM Its not quite accurate to say that Clint Eastwoods ""Changeling"" is a good movie. Rather its what you might call a Good Movie. You know the sort that feels designed for Oscars and accolades. The script is compelling the direction confident the production values professional. But it does not in the end feel real. Thats a little ironic given that ""Changeling"" is based on the true story of Christine Collins a single mother who returned to her California home one night in 1928 to find her young son Walter missing. RELATED A LITTLE PARENTAL GUIDANCE FOR JOLIES LATEST ROLEAs played by Angelina Jolie Christine alerts the police immediately but is told to call back the next day. Though shes shocked and worried the Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) isnt surprised by the LAPDs cavalier attitude. In fact hes made it his mission to expose the forces ineptitude and corruption. Tired of public criticism Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) is happy to prove Briegleb wrong by delivering Walter back home safe and sound. Only it isnt Walter. Christine would as she calmly points out know her own son. But this being 1928 she is dismissed by Jones as an emotional woman who should leave the facts to men. RELATED AMY RYAN VAMPS IT UP IN ""CHANGELING""Terrified that Walter is still alone and in danger Christine refuses to give up her search. So Jones has her forcibly detained in an asylum until she agrees that the LAPD has done its job. Then this already-surreal nightmare gets only worse when an honest officer learns the terrible fate of other missing boys. Eastwood deftly blends the details of a difficult tale while Jolie never falters. But thats something of a problem in itself She makes Christine such a nobly righteous icon of maternal strength that we cant forget were watching a performance. RELATED KIDS MIGHT PRESSURE BRANGELINA TO WEDInstead of seeing an average woman facing extraordinary circumstances were asked to admire an extraordinary woman - an international superstar - pretending to be average. This ultimately makes the movie more about the actress than the woman shes playing. And though Collins story is certainly one worth telling it would have been nice to see a bit more of her within.

Comments Changeling Recommended Clint Eastwoods angry obsession with American violence and the limits of legal justice (Unforgiven Mystic River) bursts into flower again with this grim drama based on the Wineville Chicken Murders which shocked Los Angeles in 1928. A single mother (Angelina Jolie) goes to the LAPD when her nine-year-old boy disappears; five months later a corrupt and complacent police captain (Jeffrey Donovan) announces the boy has been found but presents her with another child insisting she just doesnt recognize him and coercing her to shut up and cooperate. This incredible but true story marks the first time Eastwoods signature themes have found expression in a womans experience and the absence of any distracting machismo only heightens his sense of helpless rage at the perpetual anguish of victims families. With John Malkovich Michael Kelly Amy Ryan and Jason Butler Harner. R 140 min. By J.R.

(Tony Rivetti Jr.) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / October 24 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Changeling"" continues Clint Eastwoods improbable late-career evolution into a womens director. Dirty Harry becomes George Cukor. But this time he goes too far. The close-ups of Angelina Jolie sobbing in ""Changeling"" consecrate a Hollywood saint -- Our Lady of Perpetually Glamorous Sorrow. Her face (giant red lips; big ringed eyes; cheekbones you could use as a coat rack) belongs on stained glass as much as it does on the movie screen.Eastwoods affection for Jolie is as intense and sincere in this film as it was for Meryl Streep in ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and Hilary Swank in ""Million Dollar Baby."" But rather than lose himself entirely in his star Eastwood forgoes the intimacy hes so good at generating and attempts to construct a large complex tale of crime and corruption in 1920s Los Angeles.The director doesnt appear in ""Changeling"" but you can sense his care for both his star and the single mother she plays. Its there even as the film breaks apart into about four other films all of which are as overwrought as Eastwoods ""Mystic River"" though without the grandiosity.As in ""Mystic River"" a missing child is the narrative and moral centerpiece of ""Changeling."" The film baldly asserts in the opening minute that it is a true story as opposed to something based on a true story. In March of 1928 Christine Collins (Jolie) is abruptly called in to cover a shift at the phone and telegraph company where in roller skates she patrols the line operators. (Jolies gliding across the floor and the camera sliding along the chaos at the switchboard are the most savory images in the film.)To get to work Christine leaves her 10-year-old son Walter alone. When she returns home hes missing. A few anxious months later the LAPD says theyve found him. Christine hurries to see him arrive at the train station and knows immediately the boy isnt hers. Hilariously the police captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) insists the stress has gotten to her and the boy is indeed hers. Why doesnt she take the kid home he says for a trial run?The scenes between Christine and this trial-run son are eerie. Somethings wrong. But the boy plays along and her tentative care-giving turns angry. She tells the press the police gave her the wrong child and implies that they did so intentionally.The central drama isnt whether Christine is right - Donovans clenched jaw alone is the picture of dastardliness. Its how she suffers because she is. Jones packs her off to a nuthouse and the baleful ""Twilight Zone"" scenario goes with her.What ensues is a Susan Hayward picture - or if fans of the asylum business in ""Girl Interrupted"" are so inclined an Angelina Jolie picture. Christine resists overmedication and is befriended by fellow wrongly imprisoned inmate Amy Ryan (she may not be crazy but her blond frizz certainly is). Meanwhile the script by J. Michael Straczynski demonstrates dutiful research but no central idea as were pulled off to a police bust in Vancouver and to a ranch well east of Los Angeles in Wineville Calif. where a story of what may have happened to Walter materializes.Eastwood overcompensates for the movies meandering with a succession of hysterics - from men women and children. Theres a police confession that should break your heart except its like something out of cheap Frank Capra. You know youre in trouble when John Malkovich breathing fire as a radio pastor who takes up Christines cause is one of the movies better-behaved participants.Somewhat stranger is how comfortable Eastwood is framing banal speeches including one about hope and staging ghastly coincidences such as when Jolie faints into the arms of the Malkovich character who a scene before was somewhere else.So much cutting between Winevilles arid flatland expanses and the dank cold of the mental hospital make for a parched and chilly film. There are also horror-movie images courtroom fireworks electroshock treatments and a possible bogeyman. But all these parts are too disparate to culminate as a work of tragedy. Its department-store movie drama - ""Mysteries? Fifth floor""If anything holds ""Changeling"" together its the directors distrust of men. A good one is hard to find here. And boys are as bad as grown-ups. Such a contemptuous portrait makes you hunger for more of the sisterly camaraderie we get among the telephone operators and between Jolie and Ryan. But the movie backs away from too many of these occasions.It would be easier to accept the idea that Eastwood wasnt trying to split this world according to gender if it hadnt already been so unimaginatively cast in terms of good and bad. The police and suspects are silent-movie villains. Christine epitomizes ladylike virtue - only from her heavenward perch could she tell a character to rot in hell as she does.Ultimately Eastwood is stuck. Its as if he wanted to make a great grand film about a particular Los Angeles nightmare the way ""L.A. Confidential"" captured the city as a cauldron of racism and police corruption - a movie that looked simultaneously at the present and the past.Instead like the pastor he takes up Christines cause and his righteousness ruins the picture. Before Christine is sent away Jolies performance is unexpectedly elegant and delicate. She fills her voice with air and gently covers her mouth in sadness and shock with gloved hands - she seems dim with politeness. Even out of skates she floats through this movie.But that grace eventually hardens into the fierceness typical of Jolie - hurt her kid shell hurt you. So as ""Changeling"" strains toward its mawkishly optimistic conclusion the old-fashioned moviemaking that Eastwood settled into doesnt suit either him or his star. It feels like a corny joke.

Angelina Jolie in The Changeling Like an election conducted in a one-party state The Changeling (Universal) offers its audience a single choice to identify completely with Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) the kind beautiful persecuted single mother whose 9-year-old son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) disappears from their Los Angeles home one afternoon in 1928. (The film is based on a true story that made tabloid headlines at the time.) To make extra-double-sure that our loyalties never waver the director Clint Eastwood stuffs the ballot box by surrounding the numinous Christine with scoundrels. The LAPD investigator assigned to her case (Jeffrey Donovan) is more concerned with burnishing the reputation of his corrupt department than tracking down the missing boy. In collusion with his equally bloodless boss (Colm Feore) he tries to pass off a runaway child picked up five months later as Christines son. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Slate V The critical response to The Changeling and other movies opening this weekend. Advertisement The primal horror of this premise--a stranger is suddenly delivered to your home with the bland assurance that hes a member of your family--could have made for a movie as frightening as Invasion of the Body Snatchers and as psychologically astute as Gaslight the 1944 film in which Charles Boyer slowly convinces a perfectly sane Ingrid Bergman that shes going mad. Instead The Changeling settles for middlebrow uplift and handsomely conventional melodrama. Unlike the three-hankie ""womens pictures"" of the 30s and 40s which Eastwood explicitly cites--the long middle section set in a psych ward comes straight from the 1948 potboiler The Snake Pit--The Changeling doesnt invite the viewer to share in its heroines disorientation rage and grief. Rather it keeps us at a stately remove presenting Christines suffering as a kind of religious tableau. FBI profilers must only pray that real serial killers telegraph their intentions the way actor Jason Butler Harner does by snickering from beneath a sweaty forelock jabbering nonsensically and fondling a rifle in the back of a flatbed truck. From the second he appears its evident that Harners character a chicken farmer named Gordon Northcott is up to unwholesome shenanigans in some way related to the Collins boys disappearance. A kindly juvenile-crimes cop Detective Ybarra (Michael Kelly) picks up a teenage runaway on Northcotts property and interrogates him--an interrogation that will lead to revelations so shocking they will cause the investigators cigarette ash to fall to the floor in slow motion. In addition to Detective Ybarra Christine has one other ally in her quest the Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) a local preacher and radio evangelist whos on a crusade to expose corruption in the LAPD. At Brieglebs urging Christine holds a press conference detailing her plight--with dire consequences. Casting Malkovich against type as a good guy was a smart idea but handing him a role thats so thoroughly good sort of defeats the purpose. Briegleb is such an asexual namby-pamby that we never get any insight into his motives for standing up for the hapless Christine. Is he attracted to her? Awed by her? Or simply using her as a prop in his own vendetta? Malkovichs Robin Hood-like character never rises above the level of deus ex machina plot device (though it does give the actor a chance to repeat the fun-to-say name ""Gustav Briegleb"" in that inimitably menacing voice). Angelina Jolies performance as Christine Collins will be derided by some as Oscar-grubbing. She certainly runs through the full checklist of Academy-pleasing tropes unearned suffering lush period costumes (I want that acorn brooch) and plucky courage under duress. But Jolie isnt really to blame for this movies clomping heavy-handedness. For one thing shes profoundly miscast as an ordinary working-class woman gullible enough to be gaslighted by unscrupulous cops. Who among us believes that Angie J. couldnt clean up the LAPD with her own bare hands while roller-skating in high heels? (Jolie really does roller-skate in high heels in this movie; its part of her characters job as the constantly mobile supervisor of a telephone switchboard and one of the period details that makes The Changeling look as terrific as it does.) It may be that Jolies extracurricular celebrity is now so outsized that it compromises her ability to disappear into a role (a phenomenon I wasnt alone in observing at work in last years A Mighty Heart--as superbly as Jolie played Mariane Pearl you never forgot who she really was). But honestly Angelina Jolie was never one to disappear into a role. Shes always played women who are larger than life--too glamorous and tough and special to be assimilated into their respective milieus. Jolie is a freak of nature sexier and crazier and more powerful and just plain more than the rest of us; thats what we love about her in the tabloids and in the movies. If Eastwood had wanted to cast someone whod be convincing as a careworn single mother vulnerable enough to be taken in at first by the child-switching trick he could have chosen Amy Ryan whose always-welcome face briefly appears as the tough-but-kind prostitute who gives Christine advice in the loony bin. The mere presence of such a character--the hooker with a heart of gold who stands up to the bullying electroshock-dealing doctor--points to the fact that like many of Eastwoods late movies this one takes place in a deeply phony moral universe. How hard is it to like a baby chick better than the hobnailed boot thats stomping on it? As gifted as Angelina Jolie may be there are only so many different inflections she can give to the monotone refrain ""Please help me find my son."" All of Eastwoods rigorous craftsmanship seems wasted on a movie whose message never rises above the bumper-sticker admonition that ""mean people suck.""

Confidential Chinatown or just about any film made after 1970 about institutional corruption in Los Angeles Clint Eastwoods Changeling a period drama based on a 1928 Los Angeles missing-child case would come off as faintly geezer-ish noir lite. As LAPD scandals go the case of Christine Collins was a ripe one. In 1928 Collins a Los Angeles telephone operator and single mother came home from work to find her 9-year-old son Walter had vanished. Reporting his disappearance Collins quickly found herself first a pawn and then a target of one of the most corrupt metropolitan police administrations in the citys history which in hindsight is saying a good deal. As written by former journalist J. Michael Straczynski who rescued the story from City Hall papers headed for the junk heap Changeling mines events so bizarre they all but sit up and beg to be stuffed into a horror picture. After a tepid search a police department sorely in need of good press publicly delivered to Collins a boy who was not her son. When she protested they first impugned her mothering then shoved her into a mental hospital from which she was delivered by crowds of angry demonstrators led by a crusading Presbyterian pastor.Changeling has its dutifully lurid Ken Russell moments and the usual parade of rotten cops and pols warm-hearted tarts and little people standing up for their rights. But under Clint Eastwoods stately direction its mostly a meticulously realist period piece interrupted by flashbacks that establish the parallel stories building toward an old-fangled face-off between good and evil. When it screened at Cannes the movie even brought faint dissenting murmurs from loyal members of the Cult of Clint who called it a leaden one-off in an otherwise stainless oeuvre. To this Eastwood skeptic the movie is all of a piece with his stolid recent work in Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River. Biblically classical tastefully vintage with aerial shots of wet umbrellas and Homburg hats and not a little staid considering its sensational source material Changeling isnt so much dull as it is an open book.Certainly this determinedly mature film wont be a hot ticket with the YouTube crowd even with the glam luster of Angelina Jolie miscast but pretty good as Collins. Its hard to imagine a pair of lips (almost frighteningly bee-stung here in dark-red lipstick) less suited to blending into a crowd than Jolies even when framed by a demure bob crammed into a respectable cloche hat. Still the steely implacability she brings to her action pictures comes in handy Though her character is bathed in an aura of idealized motherhood that only an old Tory like Eastwood could still offer us with a straight face Jolie liberates her with a wonderfully contained simmer. Her irritation at being forced to take a strange child into her home hovers beautifully between touching and laugh-out-loud and blooms into quiet rage as the city mouse turns tigress in the fight to rescue not just her lost cub but other women similarly deprived of their civil rights.Here and there a sly supporting turn adds a touch of vitality John Malkovich lends a veneer of creepy austerity to the stiff-backed pastor who makes over the shy Collins into a cause celebre to support his radio vendetta against the police and their stoolies a bunch of caricatured bureaucrats puffing and heaving and narrowing their eyes. As the hooker who sets Collins straight about the civil rights violations that landed them both in the loony bin Amy Ryan does her valiant best to avoid winking when she says ""I work nights."" And Jason Butler Harner is wonderfully twitchy as Gordon Northcott the serial killer who may or may not have murdered Collins son and tortures her to the end by refusing to say which. It takes two and a half hours to bring the story to a close with two trials in the same courthouse and its worth noting that the finales dramatic balance casts Northcott as if not a bit player then a lesser evil than the speechifying paper-pushers who fail to protect and serve. Which makes Changeling less a courtroom drama than a Western whose heroes say little and do much for honor and social justice while the villains do nothing and never shut up.

Michael Straczynski; Release Date Wide 10/31/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 114; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Universal Posted October 24 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT When you go into a new movie directed by Clint Eastwood you can more or less count on the pleasure of his calm classicism -- the deftly angled shots the story that unfolds with well-carpentered precision no matter how many surprise corners it bends around. In Changeling which is based on events that took place in Los Angeles in 1928 the stately formality of Eastwoods style is even more pronounced than usual; the whole film has a slightly remote period-piece gravity. When we first meet Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) who oversees a floor of telephone operators she looks as stylized as a doll with white makeup ruby lipstick and a flapperish hat. The movie does a nice job establishing that Christine for her time is a modern woman -- a go-getter who is more than comfortable in her role as a single mother to Walter (Gattlin Griffith) her 9-year-old son. Then disaster strikes One evening Christine arrives home to learn that Walter has vanished. She is of course devastated even more so when the cops tell her its their policy not to look for a lost child until 24 hours have passed. Before long they find the boy. Or so they say. But when Christine is reunited with Walter she doesnt recognize him. She claims its not him at all. For a while I thought Changeling true to its title might be an ambiguous ethereal tale of identity. But no Early on its revealed that ""Walter"" is three inches shorter than he was before (he is also now circumcised) and the scenario becomes clear. The new child is an impostor and the police led by the scowling martinet Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) have ordered Christine to call him her own so that they can come off as heroes. The torment of Christines situation and also the dastardliness of the cops (who turn a corrupt lie into media hype) gets rubbed in our faces. When Christine tries to fight back egged on by the community activist Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) she is branded as crazy. Yet theres little mystery and therefore very little drama to any of this. Jolie who brought a tremulous power to her portrayal of Mariane Pearl in A Mighty Heart -- another woman distraught over a lost loved one -- isnt given enough notes to play here. Shes brave despairing defiant and monotonous. Changeling is a muckraker that crushes the audience under the dull weight of injustice. And when the film starts to show you what really happened to Walter it grows even more oppressive. The trouble with Changeling is that it plays less like reality than like a bare-bones moralistic rehash of other better movies such as L.A. Confidential or Frances. The oldfangled deliberateness of Eastwoods style has backfired this time only adding to the sense that though you may not have heard this particular story before you already know everything thats coming.

"Clint Eastwood Once More With Feeling | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Clint Eastwood Once More With Feeling By Christopher Rosen  11/28/08 208pm Normally the Best Original Song category at the Academy Awards is the bane of our existence an overloaded mess of badness that extends an already unending night into ass numbing proportions. No matter how the producers try to gussy up the presentation-""lets have Beyonce sing all the songs""-the performances invariably stink. Of course the exception to this happened last year when Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova performed the ballad ""Falling Slowly"" from Once to beautiful perfection (and also deservedly went home with the hardware) but otherwise not a year goes by when we dont think that the telecast would benefit greatly from a total exclusion of the Best Original Song category. That opinion might have to change after this year. Sure the potential nominees include the usual (boring) suspects like a Miley Cyrus song from Bolt and Peter Gabriels number from Wall-E but there are also original songs from Jenny Lewis (for Bolt as well) Bruce Springsteens title track for The Wrestler and the team-up of A.R. Rahman and M.I.A. for Slumdog Millionaire. Cool However The most bananas song of all might be a little duet performed by British singer-songwriter Jamie Cullum and... Clint Eastwood. Yep. That Clint Eastwood. While precious little is known about Mr. Eastwoods Gran Torino the score is available online over at the Warner Brothers awards site-a site with which weve become mildly obsessed. Buried at the bottom of that page is a song called ""Gran Torino"" written by Mr. Eastwood Mr. Cullum Kyle Eastwood (Clints son who also co-wrote the entire score) and Michael Stevens (the other co-writer of the score). Its a slow and meditative number at first; all lilting piano notes and cymbal brushes. So far so good. But then Mr. Eastwood begins singing with a voice that reminds us of Tom Waits Leonard Cohen and Christian Bale-as-Batman in The Dark Knight. (We assure you its not as awesome as that sounds.) Hearing Mr. Eastwood growl his way through rudimentary lyrics like ""gentle now the tender breeze blows whispers through my Gran Torino"" is just about as terrible as youd imagine. Thankfully for Clints sake he only sings the first verse. When Mr. Cullum starts in verse two the song actually starts to sound like a real song and not some spoof. So heres hoping for a Best Original Song nomination for Mr. Eastwood and a subsequent performance at the Academy Awards. At the very least hearing ""Gran Torino"" performed live will be more exciting than watching Peter Gabriel.

Hoberman Angelina Jolie Suffers For Us All in Changeling; Zinedine Zidane Watches a Good Game in A 21st Century Portrait Wednesday October 22 2008 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Image is everything JolieTony Rivetti Jr. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Some images aspire to be something beyond just images. They seek to become objects of veneration icons. Angelina Jolie as she appears in Clint Eastwoods Changeling is more than a mere actress or an over-publicized movie star Shes an icon of suffering. Zinedine Zidane at least in Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parrenos portrait is not simply a star athlete or even the worlds greatest soccer player He is projected as 21st-Century Man.Jolie doesnt perform in Changeling; she resolutely presents herself to the audience for admiration. The main attraction in Eastwoods two-fisted snake-pit weepie is the spectacle of Jolies steely self-possessed suffering. As she lost her husband to Islamic terrorists in A Mighty Heart Our Lady of Humanitarian Narcissism here endures another dreadful fate losing her child to a mob of knaves know-nothings and psychos even as shes persecuted by the entire state institutional apparatus of California.Based on a forgotten tabloid saga that illuminates a particularly lurid Los Angeles guilty secret and might have appealed equally to neo-noirist James Ellroy or cultural historian Mike Davis Changeling is set in a late-20s L.A. that Eastwood has lovingly repopulated with the streetcars and Model Ts of his own childhood. Jolies Christine Collins is a single mom and phone-company supervisor. One afternoon her nine-year-old son vanishes from their modest bungalow; five months later the LAPD announces with all due hoopla that the boy has been found. A reunion is staged reporters are invited and although dazed Christine immediately realizes that the cops are handing her another kid shes told to take him home on a ""trial basis--he has nowhere else to go.""The Collins mystery is predicated at least in part on the historical Christines extreme suggestibility. Why did she accept this strange boy as her own? But this is subsumed in a greater mystery Who could possibly compel Angelina Jolie to do anything she didnt want to do? Despite ample physical evidence that the child is not hers as well as assistance from a teacher a dentist and a self-regarding radio preacher (John Malkovich) Christine is browbeaten by the police bullied by the press and finally committed to a local bedlam seemingly filled with people whose mental illness consisted in pissing off the cops.Theres no denying Changelings moldy grandeur. The movie is Eastwoods version of a silent-era melodrama (and given the anachronistic psycho-babble it might better have been one). Who doesnt want to like Changeling? Clint Eastwood too is an icon. He succeeded John Wayne as Americas greatest cowboy and billed as Americas greatest living director glared out from the cover of last months Sight amp; Sound a craggy object of uncritical devotion. Its been many years (and many mediocre films) since the near-successive appearance of Bird White Hunter Black Heart and Unforgiven established Eastwoods directorial reputation. Where the existential war film Letters From Iwo Jima attested to his viability Changeling signals only his ambition.Eastwoods latest is an effort to be bracketed with Chinatown or L.A. Confidential in mythologizing the secret history of Los Angeles. But burdened by a convoluted script and an ensemble-proof leading lady the director fails to illuminate a particular corrupt system. Meanwhile this static sluggish movie grows ever darker--even as it encompasses murder pederasty captivity intimations of the Manson family multiple courtroom scenes and a death-row confrontation. For her part Jolie reverts to her goth-girl origins--her mask of tragedy suggesting a skull costumed for Halloween in a cloche hat and ghoulishly kissable wax red lips.Jolie is most convincing in her demand for recognition--and Eastwood is glad to oblige. Late in the movie Christine confidently predicts that It Happened One Night will be the surprise Oscar winner of 1934. Soon after she strikes a pose identified with Stella Dallas the motherhood tearjerker for which Barbara Stanwyck received her first nomination in 1937. Image trumps performance. One neednt be clairvoyant to know that somewhere in Hollywood someone is imagining her acceptance speech.Zidane A 21st Century Portrait a 90-minute piece by the video artists Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno tracks the great French-Algerian soccer player Zinedine Zidane during the course of a single match.The game played between Zidanes team Real Madrid and Villareal on April 23 2005 is shown in its entirety. The artists pick up their subject amid a welter of pixels and isolate him on the field. Zidane is variously shown in close-up middle shot and long shot with the occasional overhead and despite the collisions or pile-ups that sometimes occur in front of him hes most often alone in the frame. The constant attention mystifies his skills even as it burnishes his charisma. Hes set apart not only as the pieces sole subject but because hes hyper-alert continually responding to invisible forces raptly focused on events beyond the frame.Although the artists subtract everything apart from Zidanes game they dont impose a particularly strong conceptual grid on the material. The game is neither deconstructed nor defamiliarized. Meanwhile the untranslated Spanish commentary is punctuated by a mix of groans thuds and crowd noises and set to a droning New Age-y score by the Scottish band Mogwai. Zidane sweats spits and shifts position as the 17 cameras Gordon and Parreno had at their disposal watch him watching. Engaged in mystical contemplation Zidane waits for his chance--to do what? (His most mysterious action is a sudden smile.) The star contributes to one scoring play. Late in the game he gets a pat on the back from teammate David Beckham then draws a foul and is sent to the showers. A final title ""Magic is sometimes very close to nothing at all"" seems unintentionally apt.Gordons previous work--the famous 24 Hour Psycho installation which slowed Hitchcocks thriller to a glacial crawl; his superimposition of The Song of Bernadette over The Exorcist--served to monumentalize ephemeral moments. Zidane does the same to lesser effect.Adding to the mediocrity is the fact that this very piece was done decades ago by the German filmmaker Hellmuth Costard. Shot with only seven 16mm cameras Costards 1970 Football as Never Before provided precisely the same sort of portrait of Manchester United superstar George Best. Costards mode was necessarily more low-tech. But because he favored middle shots that gave Best space to perform his ""solo"" activities the result was less overweening more disorienting and not nearly so iconic. Best appeared to work; Zidane simply is. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

Sometimes there is more to gore than meets the eye. Sometimes in fact what looks on the surface like a horror movie proves to be something far more intriguing. One case in point is the mesmerizing Swedish vampire movie ""Let the Right One In"" in which dead bodies are hung like pigs after slaughter a body is decapitated and a woman bursts into flames and goes up in smoke. Though many of the traditional paraphernalia of the bloodsucking genre are present and accounted for in Tomas Alfredsons movie--teeth sink into necks windows must be boarded lest the vampire expire in the light of day--this is a vampire movie like no other. Horror is not the objective.The same is true of Clint Eastwoods ""Changeling."" Its ingredients are the stuff of gothic nightmares a kidnapped child a sane woman incarcerated in a mental institution a serial killer who slaughters young boys. The sensationalistic aspects of ""Changeling"" are not however what really interest Eastwood. Though the true shocking story its based on has enough melodrama to sustain a season of soap operas Eastwoods classical repose lifts this lurid tale to a different level. Like ""Let the Right One In""--a vampire movie reinvented in startling and tender ways--he embraces horror-movie conventions en route to transcending them.""Let the Right One In"" is both a coming-of-age tale and a love story. The pale lonely 12-year-old protagonist Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a serious solitary boy constantly picked on by his schoolmates. He retreats into fantasies of revenge collecting newspaper clippings of violent crimes. Then in the snow-banked courtyard of his apartment complex in the suburbs of Stockholm (circa 1982) he meets Eli (Lina Leandersson) a strange unkempt raven-haired girl who walks barefoot in the snow and doesnt feel the cold. ""Im not a girl"" she warns him skittish of starting a friendship. Indeed shes not--shes a vampire eternally frozen at age 12 and dependent on an older man whos not a vampire (perhaps her father perhaps not) who kills for her and brings her the blood of his victims to sustain her eternal life. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Before he realizes what she is young Oskar falls in love. He asks her to go steady. Wanting to seal his love he cuts his hand to share his blood with hers--and we freeze in anticipation of how shell react to the sight of his bleeding hand. Its a breathtaking scene but like everything in this haunting film it tilts genre expectations on their sides. By the time Oskar figures out Elis true nature its too late to turn off his feelings. Shes transformed his life--she teaches him to defend himself shes pierced his solitude and theres no turning back. Grave melancholy romantic with bursts of off-beat comedy ""Let the Right One In"" unfolds with quiet masterly assurance. Its based on a bestselling Swedish novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist who also wrote the screenplay. He and his talented director dont deny us the genres grisly thrills (strikingly but always obliquely staged) but its their psychological acuity that draws the deepest blood this is a prepubescent love story for the ages.The love of a mother drives ""Changeling."" In 1928 Los Angeles the single mom Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home from her job as a supervisor at Pacific Telephone to find her 9-year-old son Walter missing. She turns to the police who five months later announce that her missing son has been found in Illinois and is coming home. Except the boy who gets off the train she realizes with horror is not her son even though he claims to be. Shes urged to take him home and ""try him out."" So begins an astonishing saga with far-reaching personal and political ramifications. Brutal and corrupt the LAPD is a fascistic organization led by Chief James E. Davis (Colm Feore). Under siege from a crusading clergyman (John Malkovich) who is using his radio show to rouse the public against their corrupt ways the department needs a success story to shore up its scandal-ridden reputation and they werent going to let a woman ruin their PR campaign. When Collins fights back Capt. J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) has her arrested and incarcerated in the loony bin.How the tenacious Collins took on the L.A. political establishment forms the backbone of the story. (Once you get over the distractions of her fame and beauty Jolie plays her with admirable restraint and slow-burning ferocity.) If ""Changeling"" were fiction youd accuse it of being over the top and it just gets more baroque when the Collins case intersects with that of serial killer Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) who trawled the streets for boys hed lure out to his remote ranch. This is where Eastwood skirts the edges of the horror film though the worst of Northcotts atrocities are left to the imagination what you do see leaves you shaken.J. Michael Straczynskis copiously researched screenplay is a model of sturdy architecture each layer of the plot builds our horror into a fine fury but his dialogue tends to hit everything on the nose. ""Changeling"" doesnt have the moral nuances of most recent Eastwood movies the characters come neatly fit in black or white hats (or cloches). Then again some stories really are about the good guys and the bad and when the tale is this gripping why resist the moral outrage? Eastwood tells his haunting sorrowful saga with such a sure steady hand only a very hardened cynic could fail to be moved. For all the horror in both these movies they are in the end profiles in courage--human and not quite human.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

By David Denby Josh Brolin as the young George W. Bush in Oliver Stones movie.   Credit ERIC PALMA Oliver Stones ""W."" a dramatized portrait of a hollow shell named George Bush is a discomforting experience for a lot of reasons of which the most important perhaps is that Stone brings us in close to the President without giving us any reason to care about him. Back in 1995 Stone made us heed even feel for the tormented soul of Richard Nixon; the expanded directors cut of ""Nixon"" (recently released on DVD) looks stronger than ever as a portrait of an intelligent capable man (Anthony Hopkins) rotting from the inside. In ""W."" however George W. Bush (Josh Brolin) comes off as a grinning frat boy who covers his easily bruised feelings with swaggering bravado. Even if the real Bush is as simple as that (which I doubt) hes still a lousy movie character--an inadequate protagonist in his own life story. Clinging to externals Brolin thrusts out his chin and flexes his shoulders; he walks crotch forward like a dismounted broncobuster; and he speaks in short gusts as if each little group of words were a shot from a Colt .45. Brolin cant get below the surface but Im not sure that any actor could--the way the movie has been conceived there are no depths to plumb. Stanley Weisers screenplay hits the Freudian family-drama aspects of the Bush saga in the most obvious ways the hard-drinking pleasure-loving scapegrace son can never get enough approval from his stiff-jointed father George Herbert Walker Bush (James Cromwell) who talks of the family tradition as if it were a bank vault the boy was robbing. Cut down by Poppy again and again the young man somehow finds God discovers ambition and feels at ease at last as he redoes his fathers Iraq war as a reckless adventure. Whats missing from ""W."" however--what would have made the movie fascinating and not merely a hammer blow to an already expiring Presidency--is the cunning that many have noticed in Bush. Despite his familys misgivings the actual W. became both governor and President whereas the man at the center of this movie strikes you as someone who could maybe get elected social director of a country club. Stone sets Bushs upward progress in a double frame the outer frame is Bush in a baseball cap walking in the empty outfield of the Texas Rangers ballpark when he owned the club in the nineteen-nineties. In his fantasies vast crowds adore him. The inner frame is Bush the first-term President at work--a series of meetings leading up to the Iraq invasion and then its aftermath with the ruling circle of Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) Colin Powell (Jeffrey Wright) Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn) Condoleezza Rice (Thandie Newton) George Tenet (Bruce McGill) Paul Wolfowitz (Dennis Boutsikaris) and Karl Rove (Toby Jones). From the meetings Stone jumps back to scenes of the Presidents young manhood--the sloshed fraternity initiation rites at Yale a night in jail fleeting jobs much gambling and mashing of front lawns with cars. In the most effective of these moments Bush meets the young librarian Laura Welch (Elizabeth Banks) at a Texas barbecue and Stone working with a handheld camera gets an easy flirtatious conversational rhythm going between the two. Bush is self-deprecating and rakish and for a moment almost likable. Later after endless guzzling of Jack Daniels straight from the bottle he is struck down by God during his daily three-mile run and is born again. A wormy Karl Rove alternating between flattery and contempt teaches Bush what to say in public and his political career takes off. Why did Stone make the movie? He doesnt discover anything new. He and Bush are the same age (sixty-two) and they entered Yale at the same time (1964) but he feels no kinship with Bush as he clearly did with the scuzzy but canny journalist Richard Boyle in ""Salvador"" (1986) and with the embittered antiwar veteran Ron Kovic in ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989). Cold disgust--unless it leads to comedy--is probably not the most productive attitude to maintain toward your leading character. Stone seems to be making a kind of indictment of the American people this man--this soulless nothing--is what you voted for. But ""W."" feels poorly timed too late to have any effect on the public most of whom long ago checked out on the President and too early to provide more than a schematic interpretation of who he is. Making a dramatic film about a sitting President and his advisers is an awkward task. In order to get all the key players into the decision to invade Iraq Stone and Weiser have had to combine many meetings many memos and small conversations. Gathered together the characters say their famous lines (""slam dunk"" ""drain the swamp"" ""one per cent chance"" and so on) but they seem oddly to be quoting themselves rather than working through their ideas. Except for a few acid exchanges between Cheney and Powell who comes off better than he deserves the meetings feel like scenes from a didactic school play this is how we went wrong. Yet Richard Dreyfuss hunching over and baring his teeth like a shark cruising off a Marthas Vineyard beach does a wicked impersonation of Cheney. His relish for the part suggests that the movie should have been done not as an earnest bio-pic but as a satirical comedy--as a contemporary ""Dr. Strangelove"" with a cast of satyrs and clowns. Set in the late nineteen-twenties and early thirties in middle-class Los Angeles when ruby-lipped women wore long coats and cloche hats and cars were square-backed dark and dignified Clint Eastwoods new movie ""Changeling"" is calm and smooth. As a piece of filmmaking ""Changeling"" is both impressive and monotonous. The trouble with period movies made by talented craftsmen who are serious about authenticity and consistency is that no one wants to mess up the shots. That sense of overcontrol accounted I believe for the disappointment that many felt last year in Ang Lees period movie ""Lust Caution"" which apart from its convulsive sex scenes seemed to take place under glass. ""Changeling"" isnt quite as static as that but I wish that Eastwood and the writer J. Michael Straczynski had pushed deeper into the perverse strangeness of their story which is based on actual events. In March 1928 a telephone-company supervisor and single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home from work and finds an empty house--her nine-year-old son Walter has disappeared. After months of lackadaisical investigation the Los Angeles police who have a serious public-relations problem (theres been a lot of corruption and shootings) triumphantly produce a child who was found in Illinois. The boy looks like Walter but he isnt. When Christine protests the captain in charge of the case J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) accuses her of being irresponsible and emotionally unstable. Jones hires medical hacks to conspire in the charade of the false Walter finally throwing Christine into a police-run psycho ward where shes threatened with shock therapy if she doesnt play along. ""Changeling"" is an austerely made feminist protest drama. In the beginning everyone condescends to Christine as a woman and therefore as someone of inferior intelligence and will. Angelina Jolie has said that she was attracted to the story of Christines refusal to knuckle under and of her martyrdom and she stays firmly in character as a person whos stubborn and hardworking but not terribly bright--she is strong enough to look after herself and her boy but ill equipped to take on male authority. Tears and trembling and fear alternate with bursts of courage. In all Jolie gives a skilled and selfless performance but it doesnt have an interesting corner in it. If Christine was not the kind of woman to turn logic and scorn on the arrogant men oppressing her then couldnt she at least have some desires some temperament? She has only one dimension as a faultless fighting mom and she is aided by an equally uncomplicated guardian angel Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) a severe and entirely impersonal Presbyterian minister who hates the Los Angeles police and sees Christine as a tool to beat them with. The two of them make a very proper and dull pair of collaborators. ""Changeling"" is beautifully wrought but it has the abiding fault of righteously indignant filmmaking it congratulates us for feeling what we already feel--in this case contempt for psychiatry used as coercion and for long-discredited male-chauvinist attitudes. There is a second layer of narrative--a lunatic with an axe out in the desert near Riverside is kidnapping and murdering little children one of whom may be Walter. But Eastwood finds himself in a bind he doesnt want to exploit the gruesome material or even let us see it too clearly since killing children as a movie spectacle doesnt fit well with the delicate emotions aroused by a woman longing for her son. Eastwood and Straczynski settle for a methodical working out of the historical narrative--Christines legal strike against the police and the trial of the murderer. The moral emotional and dramatic issues are settled and then the movie reverently chronicling Christines apotheosis ambles on for another forty minutes.

She didnt recognize him which irritated the patriarchal and corrupt police captain so much he threw her into a mental hospital. It would be a horrific story even if underplayed but Eastwood shoots it like a horror movie. The false boy is lit to resemble the Antichrist Damien in The Omen while in the psychiatric ward whey-faced loons press their heads against the bars and shriek ugly nurses leer and the creepy doctor plots to throw Angie on a gurney and give her jolts of electricity. The ham-handed script by J. Michael Straczynski rearranges events so that the motives of the police captain (Jeffrey Donovan) are unfathomablehe must want Damien to grow up and bring forth Armageddon. The way Eastwood shoves Jolies suffering in our face is like a threat to the Academy And the Oscar will go to  Shes a great actress. She doesnt need his domineering chivalry. -- David Edelstein Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick Outcast Recap Sympathy For the Devil The Great British Baking Show Recap Rough Puff The Great British Baking Show Recap Lady Fingers TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

A thematic companion piece to ""Mystic River"" but more complex and far-reaching ""Changeling"" impressively continues Clint Eastwoods great run of ambitious late-career pictures. Emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed this true story-inspired drama begins small with the disappearance of a young boy only to gradually fan out to become a comprehensive critique of the entire power structure of Los Angeles circa 1928. Graced by a top-notch performance from Angelina Jolie the Universal release looks poised to do some serious business upon tentatively scheduled opening late in the year. Constructed around the infamous ""Wineville Chicken Murders"" in Riverside County Calif. which achieved great notoriety at the time and surprisingly have never inspired a film before the outstanding screenplay by J. Michael Straczynski (creator of TVs ""Babylon 5"") has deceptive simplicity and ambition to it qualities the director honors by underplaying the melodrama and not signaling the storys eventual dimensions at the outset. Characters and sociopolitical elements are introduced with almost breathtaking deliberation as dramatic force and artistic substance steadily mount across the long-arc running time. With a melancholy mood set by Eastwoods typically spare guitar-and-piano score the languid opening stretch stresses the ordinary nature of life for single mother Christine Collins (Jolie) and her 10-year-old son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) who share a modest house in a quiet neighborhood in Los Angeles. Christine has the photogenic job of telephone supervisor on roller-skates overseeing dozens of female operators as they connect calls at a giant switchboard. Early sound films were loaded with scenes of smart-talking women handling phone lines; Eastwood takes advantage of the inspiration of skates to cover them in neat tracking shots. One day when Christine is late getting home from work Walter is gone. Nearly five months later Christine is informed that her son has been found in Illinois. With all attendant hoopla for the benefit of the press and police a reunion is arranged at the train station but as soon as the boy steps onto the platform Christine knows this kid is not her son. The police fronted by Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) insist otherwise waving off definitive evidence relating to physical discrepancies. Even when Walters dentist teacher and fellow students insist hes not the right boy the replacement himself remains maddeningly resolute driving the otherwise level-headed Christine to distraction. Or at least thats the way it looks to the cops who promptly throw her in the psycho ward for her alleged delusion. Fears that the story is now destined to veer off into ""The Snake Pit"" or given Jolies presence ""Girl Interrupted"" looney-bin cliches prove largely unfounded despite a couple of brief electroshock scenes. Rather this is where the picture really spreads its wings as ramifications of this tragic but unexceptional case seep through the police department the legal system the medical establishment and City Hall in entirely unexpected ways. Initially this is due to the tireless efforts of a crusading radio evangelist the Rev. Gustav Briegleb (an intent focused John Malkovich) one of whose missions is to expose what he sees as the complete corruption of the LAPD under Chief James E. Davis (Colm Feore). On Christines side from the beginning the pastor persists in using her case to spotlight the departments malfeasance and the character is notable as one of the few screen depictions of a righteous Christian leader of this period (the era of Aimee Semple McPherson) to be cast in an entirely favorable light. Irrevocably setting the judicial machinery in motion is a boy in his early teens (Eddie Alderson extraordinary) who movingly tells police about some horrific murders of kidnapped boys hes unwillingly participated in with an unhinged young man Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) out in the desert. What happens next -- to Capt. Jones the police chief the mayor and the murderers among others -- is all part of the public record and the less than salubrious history of Los Angeles politics. The intercutting of two heavyweight proceedings a murder trial and a landmark City Hall hearing provide the storys dramatic crescendo although even greater tension stems from what comes thereafter. In the end ""Changeling"" joins the likes of ""Chinatown"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" as a sorrowful critique of the citys political culture. A dozen filmmakers could have taken a dozen different approaches to the same material -- sensationalistic melodramatic expose-minded a kids or killers p.o.v. and so on. Perhaps the best way to describe Eastwoods approach is that hes extremely attentive -- to the central elements of the story to be sure (with its echoes of ""A Perfect World"") but also to the fluidity between the private and the public the arbitrariness of life and death the distinct ways different people view the same thing the destructive behavior of some adults toward children and the quality of life in California around the time he was born. Despite the materials dark themes the Los Angeles setting helps make ""Changeling"" one of Eastwoods most visually vivid films; cinematographer Tom Sterns mobile camera has a graceful elegance and several panoramic CGI vistas merge smoothly with location lensing to unemphatically evoke the dustier less congested city of 80 years ago. Production designer James J. Murakamis many sets impressively create a constant play of light and dark environments and further period verisimilitude stems from Deborah Hoppers costumes and the occasional presence of the extinct Red Car trolleys. As she did in ""A Mighty Heart"" Jolie plays a woman abruptly and agonizingly deprived of the person closest to her. But impressive as she may have been as the wife of Danny Pearl her performance here hits home more directly due to the lack of affectation -- no accent frizzed hair or darkened complexion and no attempt to consciously rein in emotion. There are inevitable one-note aspects to her Christine Collins as she must exasperatedly repeat her positions to the authorities again and again. But Jolie makes it clear Christine maintains a grip on her sanity in the face of many assaults on its stability. Pic offers a wealth of sterling supporting turns from significant ones down to fleeting bit parts. The pressure felt by the police to toe the party line is deftly expressed in different ways by Donovan Feore and Michael Kelly the latter very fine as the cop who unearths the evidence at the murder site. Harner is startlingly unpredictable as the showboating but wimpy killer while Geoff Pierson is commandingly charismatic as the eminent lawyer who calls the city big shots to account. Postscript noting the fates of certain characters conveniently elides the sad and/or ironic destinies awaiting some of them.
