Posted January 9 2008 -- 1200 AM EST One Missed Call punches the contemporary fear buttons of infernal technology and child abuse. But toredial applicable catchphrases this garbled American remake of Takashi Miikes already staticky 2004 exercise in J-horror is a wrong number. The bad machine is the ubiquitous cell phone specifically ones that herald death by recording the sounds of each recipients demise -- from the future. And the child-abuse subplot involves an all-purpose blend of bad mommy and demon child archetypes souped up with the wandering-ghost consequences so beloved in Japanese popular culture and a touch of dialing from beyond the grave. Youve got to deliver a lot more than a customized ringtone to impress the iPhone generation or to scare anyone familiar with the old glimpsed-human-who-morphs-into-ghoul routine -- a demand that defeats French director Eric Valette. (This is his first American production.) Shannyn Sossamon plays the Pretty Girl Who Survives with a minimum of particularity; Ed Burns offers even less as the Cop Who Believes Her. As the cop who doesnt the comic Margaret Cho shows up for a line or two -- and her on-set experience should make for another good monologue someday considering the riffs shes done about answering-machine messages from her own very unghostly mother.

"This Calls worth missing | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThis Calls worth missing Cellphones are no doubt about it sinister devices and any movie that spotlights the menace of these digital extensions of our ears and mouths deserves some credit.Why do the girls in these horror movies always go into creepy dark buildings? Watch out Ana Claudia Talancon  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Philip MarchandMoviesSun. Jan. 6 2008 (out of four)Starring Shannyn Sossamon Edward Burns Ana Claudia Talancon Raegan Lamb. Directed by Eric Valette. Written by Andrew Clavan. 87 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowCellphones are no doubt about it sinister devices and any movie that spotlights the menace of these digital extensions of our ears and mouths deserves some credit. One Missed Call a remake of a 2003 Japanese horror movie is aimed at a teenaged audience. It knows how addicted teens are to such devices. and it knows how these devices wont go away. Characters at certain points try in desperation to incapacitate their cellphones by removing their batteries smashing them on the pavement throwing them into an aquarium and cancelling their subscription to their cellphone plans.A televangelist even tries to exorcise a cellphone. Nothing works. The phones continue to transmit the horrid messages stored on their voice mail no matter what. Beth Raymond the heroine played by Shannyn Sossamon knows something is up. ""Are you okay?"" she asks her friend Leann (Azura Skye). ""You look weirded out."" Leann has every reason to be weirded out. Shes been receiving phone messages from a dead friends phone messages that seem to be about her own imminent demise. At the same time she is hallucinating about black centipedes and ghoulish-looking strangers. Before long Leann does in fact meet with a gruesome end and its the turn of her cellphone to leave nuisance calls on a friends voice mail. ""Its like dead people calling you"" a hysterical teen explains to her friends. ""And then you die too""Enter police detective Jack Andrews played by Edward Burns who had a notable role in Saving Private Ryan. Andrews sympathizes with Beth - his own sister is lying in the morgue after dying in similar circumstances. Naturally he meets with resistance from colleagues reluctant to investigate these particular claims of the paranormal. ""This girl needs protection"" he shouts to one peer referring to Beth the latest recipient of the phone calls. ""From what?"" his colleague replies. ""Ghosts in her cellphone?""Its a fair question. I have another question. Why do heroines in these horror movies feel compelled as does Beth to run into horrible dark creepy buildings and roam their horrible dark hallways filled with evil beings all by their lonesome? What is the girl thinking?Other questions might concern why plot and characterization in One Missed Call are so flimsy even by the standards of this genre. Absent plot and characterization the movie is pure mechanized technique. French director Eric Valette does his best to disorient the audience with an unending series of close-ups shots from low angles shots from high angles quick cuts and a camera that wont stop moving. In addition there are numerous loud startling noises and a music score that grabs your nervous system and gives it a good rattling. The best part of the movie is the fact that at a running time of an hour and a half its mercifully short.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"In Missed Call plot is hopelessly disconnected - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGames THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In Missed Call plot is hopelessly disconnected Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / January 5 2008 Sometimes if my cellphone is near a set of speakers before a call comes in the speakers start sizzling. This could be an ""amplified electromagnetic emission."" But its probably just the devil. Ask ""One Missed Call"" part do-it-yourself lobotomy kit part-David Cronenberg for the lobotomized part anti-mobile propaganda. You know how it is. When the movies feel threatened by entertainment technology they satanize it - ""Poltergeist"" ""The Ring"" ""Pulse."" For those last two and this new one the instructions are in Japanese and aimed more or less at college kids.""One Missed Call"" was originally a so-so Takashi Miike freak-out. Now its a worse-worse American eyesore. Its writer (Andrew Klavan) and director (Frenchman Eric Valette) can no more produce an honest scare - that loud quick cut to a doll hanging in a closet; are you kidding me? - than they can deliver an ending that wont make you want to heave a boot at the screen.""One Missed Call"" does have a great title one nutty televised exorcism of a cellphone (for real) and Shannyn Sossamon who was nutty-great in that episode of ""Law amp; Order SVU"" about the college student who claimed her professor raped her. Its probably on USA right now. Here the unit of victimhood is a lot less special. For one thing Sossamon seems too old for both this college mess and for running around trying to keep herself and her friends from dying the stupid deaths prognosticated in supernatural voice mails. Kids just change your calling plan.Sossamon is running around with Edward Burns as his latest tired-looking detective. Theyre like Audrey Tautou and Tom Hanks in ""The DaVinci Code."" If only Sossamon turned out to be Jesuss daughter. Instead shes just another of the movies abused children.The movie lacks the skill for suspense and the imagination for frightening imagery Yes folks heres another goblin who knows the choreography from ""Thriller."" Ana Claudia Talancon Meagan Good Azura Skye Margaret Cho and Ray Wise are all momentarily in the cast. Had they done the same electrocuted undead head-cock the movie would have been something.But no this is another demonstration of how certain studios and producers care neither about us nor the skill required to pull off a respectable work of garbage. The kid in front of me spent most of the movie playing Tetris on his phone. I didnt care enough about the movie to ask him to stop (or to find a cooler game). The jumpy girls behind me laughed once the cheap scares started to feel just insultingly cheap. Men mocked the abuse flashbacks. Someone else asked why Sossamon was bothering to look around an ominously dingy house and drag herself through a vent when shes scheduled to die in five minutes. The girl spoke as much to her friend as to the screen when she said ""Id a been gone home."" We were having different versions of the same thought Cellphones are evil? Shoot.

"One Missed Call | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; one-missed-call ) One Missed Call (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli One Missed Call is yet another PG-13 horror movie adapted from a Japanese source. Taken in concert with The Ring one has to wonder if these productions illustrate some subconscious fear of technology felt by the Japanese. First theyre being menaced by video tapes. Now its cell phones. Whats next The Blu-Ray ghost? One Missed Call starts out with an intriguing premise then ruins it by trying to build a story around it that explains too much. Of course the more exposition it delivers the sillier the entire thing becomes until it collapses under its own weight. This is the kind of concept that cries out for atmosphere and existentialism not gratuitous ""boo"" moments and endless shots of people crawling around in dark spaces with a flashlight. If ever there was a reason not to check your cell phone voicemail this is it - not that most of us worry about a ghost hiding out in the circuitry of our most indispensable electronic gadget. (Although I wonder about gremlins sometimesa|) Of course it doesnt matter if you forget your password because cell phones in this movie dont use them nor do they need batteries which could be an argument in favor of a haunted phone. No more worrying about recharging or having to hang up when the indicator reads ""zero bars."" Presumably the ghost has also solved the cell signal problem. The single drawback - looming death - is one of those side effects that probably shouldnt be ignored. Another problem with the film is that it fails to play by its own rules. No horror movie takes place in ""our"" universe so its important that productions in this genre establish a series of guidelines early in the proceedings then adhere to them. One Missed Call does the former but ignores the latter. Late in the film it throws established conventions out the window so it can provide a ""surprise"" thats as cheap as it is pointless. The movie ends up not making any sense even when taken on its own terms. The premise is that teenagers are receiving messages on their cell phones from themselves at the moments of their deaths. One supposes it could be unsettling to check your voicemail and hear yourself screaming. Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) has to go through this with several of her friends before she becomes the target. By that time she has acquired an ally in the person of a police detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns) whos interested because his sister was a victim of the same phenomenon. So rather than idly waiting for the moment of her death (the way everyone else does) Beth (with Jack in tow) starts investigating. Predictably it doesnt take long before ghosts become involved. Director Eric Valette throws some creepy images on the screen but they dont make up for the dimwittedness of the screenplay. (Maybe something was lost in translation.) Its not just that the storyline doesnt hold together. The secondary characters in addition to being cardboard-thin and uniformly uninteresting just sit around waiting to die. No raging against the dying of the light. Its almost disturbing how easily they yield to the inevitable. It takes a full 45 minutes before Beth finally gets tagged as ""it."" Since we know this is where things are going its unforgivable for the movie to take so long to get to this point. Once it happens though the delay is understandable because the filmmakers struggle to fill another 40 minutes. The entire production seems like a 30-minute short that has been expanded beyond its breaking point. And what the hell is Ray Wise doing in this movie? His entire purpose seems to be to act as much like Leland Palmer as possible to increase the weirdness factor by reminding us he was once a murderer possessed by a supernatural spirit. It would be difficult to find two lower key performers than Shannyn Sossamon and Edward Burns. Neither is a bad actor but theres no energy here. Early in the film Beth remarks that her reading a research paper aloud would put another character to sleep. Theres truth in that statement; Sossamon is so mellow that its only Valettes ""boo"" moments that keep the audience from succumbing to the desire to slumber. Successful ghost stories do not threaten to put viewers into the arms of Morpheus. They aim for something less passive. The worst part about this movie is that even though its impossible to piece everything together logically its easy to see where its going because theres nothing new here. Theres a sameness to all these Japanese-turned-American retreads. No matter how obtuse the storyline is and how uninteresting the characters are the formula must be adhered to. The result is uninspired and painfully familiar. Based on the recent decline in box office for this sub-genre theres reason to hope the fad may be dying out. If One Missed Call isnt another nail in the coffin it tries hard to be one.

"One Missed Call is totally disconnected - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs One Missed Call is totally disconnectedJanuary 05 2008|By Scott Schueller Tribune staff reporter""One Missed Call"" is one bad movie.American remakes of Japanese horror-thrillers have been hit or miss. For every box office smash such as ""The Ring"" (129 million in 2002) theres an equally unsuccessful ""Pulse"" (20 million in 2006). ""One Missed Call"" re-engineers 2003s ""Chakushin Ari"" and follows the Far Eastern genres tradition of death delivered through evolving technology (video cassettes the Internet and cell phones). Try as it may to capture the originals success in Japan ""One Missed Call"" ends up a remake better left unmade.Shannyn Sossamon and Ed Burns try to find the supernatural cause behind people getting a cell phone preview of the moment of their death. That the tipped-off victims treat this as only slightly more annoying than a call from a telemarketer doesnt help the films momentum.The two investigate clues linking the victims by their phone books leading down a path of loose affiliations and including a very confusing piece about the Sossamon characters childhood that has no relevance to the film.The script appears to blatantly rip-off plot devices and story elements from ""The Ring"" but screenwriter Andrew Klavan avoids plagiarism by tacking on an incomprehensible second ending where ""Ring"" would have left off. The script blends deaths from bad circumstances and unexplainable supernatural murders too casually Is it the phone calls or a simple case of wrong place at the wrong time? Adding to the confusion is a glazed-over explanation of how the dead are communicating through the phone lines.While director Eric Valette provides the occasional chill the very disturbing spooks arent enough to make this boat float. Burns sleepwalks through ""One Missed Call"" totally devoid of charisma and Sossamon muddles along going through the motions. Sadly ""Twin Peaks"" alum Ray Wise appears only fleetingly and isnt used to his potential.MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and terror frightening images some sexual material and thematic elements).""One Missed Call"" One-half starDirected by Eric Valette; screenplay by Andrew Klavan; photographed by Glen MacPherson; production design by Laurence Bennett; edited by Steve Mirkovich; music by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek; produced by Broderick Johnson Andrew Kosove Scott Kroopf Jennie Lew Tugend and Lauren Weissman.

Yet another J-horror title is recycled for Western consumption in ""One Missed Call"" a remake of the 2003 Nipponese spooker that remains one of gonzo helmer Takashi Miikes more conventionally commercial efforts. English-language debut for director Eric Valette (whose French feature ""Malefique"" stirred excitement at fantasy fests also in 2003) reps an improvement in some respects not least in running nearly a half-hour shorter. This decent if derivative scare machine benefited from a weekend launch with little genre competition to notch up 13.5 million domestically and should see solid returns in most territories to be followed by good ancillary trade. The odd death of a young woman and her cat in a Japanese-garden-style pool appears to trigger a series of freakish abrupt demises among her good-looking students in an unspecified U.S. college town. (Pic was shot in various Georgia locations.) These fatalities are linked by social or professional ties with each victims cell-phone address book providing a next-in-line supply of designated deaths. Eerily they all receive a cell-phone message from the previous victim -- the sound of his or her own last violently terminated moments. The two nerve-wracking days between call and curtains are filled with disturbing hallucinations of the ""I see dead people"" variety. Turning off phones removing their batteries throwing them away or even smashing them to bits doesnt seem to reduce mortal peril for those already given a voicemail death sentence. This certainly makes campus life less pleasant for the circle of friends surrounding Beth (Shannyn Sossamon) who has the ill fortune to witness the variously grotesque deaths of her pals. She is clearly next but has a hard time convincing skeptical authorities (including a cop played by comedian Margaret Cho in a rare if nondescript dramatic role) though she does gain an ally in Det. Jack Andrews (Edward Burns) whose own sister also just died a mysterious death. Andrew Klavans screenplay maintains the prior versions (and presumably the source novels) basic premise and some specific situations but reps a fairly free adaptation. Both he and Valette tighten up the original pics somewhat convoluted uneven progress while also paying a price in escalated last-act silliness. The Miike films midpoint highlight -- in which a characters doom is exploited by a reality TV show -- is reprised to far lesser effect here. On the plus side Valette demonstrates considerable assurance maintaining suspense (even if its often of the anticipating-the-next-false-scare variety) in a presumably for-hire Hollywood-entree job. Production values are polished and atmospheric. Sossamon (""A Knights Tale"" ""Wristcutters A Love Story"") stays too emotionally neutral compared to the earlier victims who make vividly panicked impressions; Burns is adequate. ""One Missed Calls"" impact is curtailed by its cliched overly familiar presentation of child abuse as a dark narrative secret CGI-assisted ghouls and PG-13 ""gotcha"" moments. Where its rating is concerned pic really demonstrates MPAA values at work It has tons of nightmarish imagery violence and tension but since theres no blatant gore (excluding decomposed bodies) and no overt sexuality its deemed suitable for irresponsible family viewing.
