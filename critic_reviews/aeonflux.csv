One of them which approaches pure enchantment has been woven from dazzling imagery inspired design and a pair of powerful performances Charlize Theron as Snow Whites persecutor Queen Ravenna and Chris Hemsworth as the put-upon heroines protector the Huntsman of the title. An evil spell nearly does Snow White in but its lifted in the nick of time. The strangest spell afflicts Kristen Stewart; she cant seem to imbue Snow White with anything more than a semblance of feeling. That spell never lifts but it doesnt make much difference in the end because the forces of good manage to work around it. In a twist to the fairy tale the Huntsman ordered to take Snow White into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen. Video courtesy of Universal. This ambitious production was directed by Rupert Sanders a first-time feature filmmaker who made his reputation with television commercials. Hes a whiz at visual storytelling and he has surrounded himself with such top-notch collaborators as the production designer Dominic Watkins; the cinematographer Greig Fraser and the costume designer Colleen Atwood. (The Gothic look of Ravennas ravishing gowns is sharpened by Art Deco.) They summon up a sumptuously dark and revisionist kingdom thats closer to ""Game of Thrones"" than the Brothers Grimm let alone Walt Disney. Not since ""The Lord of the Rings"" has landscape been so central to mood. For once the effects are special because theyre original the digital dwarfing of seven full-size full-throated performers (more about that later); swarms of crows and their visual echoes shards of black glass into which Ravenna and her cohorts shatter when struck by swords; the queens rising after her shattering from some sort of primordial slime. The main de-Grimming of the plot concerns the Huntsman who in this version is dispatched to capture Snow White but becomes her ardent protector and then her tutor in martial arts. (The script was written by Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini.) To anyone who has seen Mr. Hemsworths recent work in ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and ""The Avengers"" it will come as no surprise that hes a graceful presence as well as a forceful one and as witty as the circumstances allow. (""So youre back from the dead and instigating the masses"" the Huntsman tells Snow White at one point with a lilt in his voice and a twinkle in his eye. She responds with a wan puzzled smile.) The most indelible image of Ravenna is from the back and of her back--curved and ebony white with a spine photographed to seem reptilian. From any angle though Ms. Theron makes the queen a fearsome creature not to mention a man-hater of epic ferocity. ""Immortality"" Ravenna cries lustfully ""immortality forever"" Good for her that she wont settle for the short-term variety; shes as vampiric as any of Ms. Stewarts pals from other precincts. In her time and in her way Ravenna is the ultimate consumer of beauty products sucking the life from those around her to sustain her baleful glow. As movie villains go the queens brother Finn is right down there with the worst of them. Played with stylish malevolence by Sam Spruell he leads a small army that tracks Snow White and the Huntsman through a dead forest (where a terrific chase ends in the ignominy of mud); that lays waste to a peasant village (where consuming fires evoke ""Apocalypse Now"") and follows them to an enchanted sanctuary where the mushrooms have tiny Cyclops eyes and little albino fairies flit about leaving trails of fairy dust. Intense action high-tech aesthetics and exotic settings are Mr. Sanderss strong suits. The director sets a heart-pounding pace pausing only for such interludes as Snow Whites encounter with seven dwarfs who could not be more distant from their Disney forebears. ENLARGE Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna in Snow White and the Huntsman. Universal Studios The decision to cast the little people as they have been cast was both daring and politically incorrect. Why werent they played by short-statured actors like Peter Dinklage who has finally found the celebrity he deserves on ""Game of Thrones""? Because one suspects the prospect of digitizing Bob Hoskins Ray Winstone Eddie Marsan and other lesser-known but equally formidable Brits was just too delicious to resist. The decision pays off though not as fully as it might have. For all their oddity and for all the sweetness of Snow Whites slow dance with one of their number these dwarfs dont measure up to their potential because the script doesnt bother to differentiate their personalities. Theyre not the only ones who serve more as symbols than individuals; thats how the director steeped in the bold symbolics of TV commercials seems to see the good and evil of Snow Whites world. And thats OK when hes working with Ms. Theron or Mr. Hemsworth; skillful as well as intuitive these stars provide all the nuance a director could ask for. But Snow White is literally another story even though according to Mr. Hoskinss dwarf ""she is life itself."" Ms. Stewarts skills havent caught up with her celebrity so its almost painful to watch and listen as she struggles with an English accent and intones her dialogue lifelessly Not just complex questions like the one Snow White puts to the Huntsman--""Do you drink to drown your sorrows or your conscience?""--but simple lines like her declaration to the dwarfs ""We mean you no harm."" The heroine is more excitable though no more eloquent in her Joan of Arc mode once she has absorbed the Huntsmans lessons of war and leads her followers into the fray. Then the problem becomes displaying her leaps and lunges to best advantage--the actress aspires to more agility than she achieves--while keeping a lid on her shrill outcries. Still whos to say that Ms. Stewart wont give the movie exactly what it needs--legs plus a strong sword arm at the box office? Bella redux she faces the world with adolescent angst and a Twilighted frown and no one is more entitled than Snow White to be angsty. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD Focus ENLARGE Aeon Flux (2005) By now everyone knows that Charlize Theron is a fine actress and that shes done a number of excellent movies. This one does not aspire to excellence or anything close to that heady neighborhood. Its a sci-fi thriller based on the animated MTV show and pretty dreadful if truth be told. But ""Aeon Flux"" is Ms. Therons ""Barbarella"" the sci-fi oddity that earned Jane Fonda perverse renown so its worth a mirthful watch or at least a streaming-service glance. Karyn Kusama directed a cast that includes Jonny Lee Miller Frances McDormand and the late Pete Postlethwaite. Thor (2011) Another film that not only doesnt aspire to excellence but dodges it at every turn. Chris Hemsworth stars as the young God of Thunder who struggles against evil forces and his own impetuousness. The movie struggles against all-encompassing ponderousness and loses. Yet Mr. Hemsworth is a commanding physical presence and a likable one whenever hes given a chance. In certain scenes he seems to be reaching for the state of comedic grace that Amy Adams attained in ""Enchanted."" Thors love interest on Earth is Natalie Portmans astrophysicist Jane who talks earnestly about resolving her particle data. Into the Wild (2007) Kristen Stewart is Tracy Tatro in Sean Penns fascinating screen version of the Jon Krakauer book of the same name. Its a very small role but she gets to sing in a trailer park and gives an agreeably vital performance that could still be predictive of things to come in her career. Emile Hirsch stars as Chris McCandless a kid from a prosperous family who wants to live the life of an aesthetic voyager but blunders into it with unexamined survival skills. The cast includes Marcia Gay Harden William Hurt Catherine Keener Vince Vaughn and Hal Holbrook. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

And yet Aeon Flux is as cartoony as its animated TV series-inspiration and not in a particularly good way either. Flux (Charlize Theron) is a rebel living in a post-apocalyptic walled city assigned to assassinate leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas). She uses some pretty nifty tricks to break into his high-security headquarters but once there finds herself attracted to her target. Do they know each other from another life? Its hard to care when the dialogue and plotting are so rudimentary. Perhaps even more damningly this is visually drab failing to exploit either Therons catsuited charms or those of its futuristic cityscapes. Fans of sci-fi B movies should find some pleasure in the films central ideas - recalling both Logans Run and The Island - but the execution means this is unlikely to win its star or director any further awards.

Photo Credit Jasin Boland/Paramount Pictures Photo Jasin Boland / Paramount Picture Image 2 of 2 - - Photo Paramount Pictures REVIEW / Dressed to kill four centuries into the future 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Aeon Flux Sci-fi action. Starring Charlize Theron Marton Csokas Jonny Lee Miller and Frances McDormand. Directed by Karyn Kusama. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Aeon Flux"" was the big movie to open on Friday but it was hidden from critics. Historically some great films have been released so as to avoid critical scrutiny (""Psycho"" ""Touch of Evil"") and occasionally a studio will lose interest in a perfectly charming movie and just dump it into theaters (""Bloodhounds of Broadway""). But for the most part an unscreened movie is usually either terrible trivial or strangely off. The best of these categories is Strangely Off and thats what ""Aeon Flux"" is. Based on the animated MTV series and starring Charlize Theron this film set 400 years in the future has some intriguing ideas and Theron neither embarrasses herself nor makes herself repellent. Shes acrobatic without being robotic and seems emotionally present. Unlike Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Garner she apparently doesnt mistake acting like a lobotomized zombie for some glorious feminist statement and this is to her credit. But something flaccid about the story makes it hard to sit all the way through ""Aeon Flux"" while fully awake. The setup is fine A disease has wiped out most of the worlds population. What is left -- about 5 million people -- now live inside a walled city in which they are ruled by a wealthy family that tends to their needs but denies their freedom. But now there are rebels who want to expand beyond the walls who want lives of adventure and discovery. Aeon (Theron) is one of them a killing machine in a tight jumpsuit and she is given the task of assassinating the leader of the city state Chairman Goodchild (Marton Csokas). One would figure after 400 years of bad action movies that leaders would learn If a woman comes at you dressed in a tight jumpsuit duck. Anyway the idea of people trading in their freedom for safety is more relevant today than when MTV created this series. The movie has some interesting ideas about the future of telecommunications People swallow little capsules that enable them to receive other peoples thoughts. It also has some interesting ideas about cloning. Here people are cloned over and over and carry with them a kind of collective memory as well as an oppressive weariness at having been alive so long. Each generation is a separate life and yet with each incarnation a greater weight seems to oppress the spirit. Yet once the audience realizes early in the story that the object of the assassination plot is not all that bad a fellow the movie begins to drag and stall. Its ultimate destination becomes clear and the rest is just a matter of trying to stay awake trying not to snore and trying not to roll over into the person in the next seat while waiting for the inevitable. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

The future looks alternately grim and hysterical in ""Aeon Flux"" a spectacularly silly sci-fier that plays like ""The Matrix"" crossed with ""The Island"" and reinterpreted as a long-lost Michael Jackson video. Giving Charlize Theron untold opportunities to slink around in artfully shredded spandex this kitschy Paramount vehicle was ushered sans advance press screenings into wide release where it will likely draw meager male-centric biz before getting lost amid the glut of end-of-the-year prestige releases. Fans of the original MTV series however may find it an intriguing homevid collectible. Launched as a series of animated shorts shown on MTVs ""Liquid Television"" in 1991 (and later reborn as a half-hour skein that lasted 10 episodes) ""Aeon Flux"" achieved considerable cult fandom with its sexy visceral spin on traditional sci-fi elements and its intriguing title heroine -- a ruthless and ruthlessly sexy killer given to dispatching her enemies in inventively baroque ways. In its earliest incarnation the series was also notable for its lack of dialogue -- a deficiency that scribes Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi have rectified here to highly questionable effect. Story is set in the year 2415 four centuries after a fatal virus wiped out 99% of the earths population forcing the surviving 1% to relocate to the pristine walled-in city of Bregna. At once a dubious paradise and a marvel of trippy production design Bregna is ruled by chairman Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) and his brother Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) who keep a tight grip on the population via a combination of constant surveillance and military force. Enter Aeon Flux (Theron) a raven-haired assassin on the side of a secret band of rebels known as the Monicans. Bedeviled by bizarre nightmares and memories she cant explain Aeon turns vengeful after the government murders her peace-loving sister Una (Amelia Warner) making it a matter of the utmost personal satisfaction when shes ordered to kill Trevor by the Monicans leader (Frances McDormand in a flaming red wig backlit for maximum comic effect). Flanked by ally Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) who happens to have hands instead of feet Aeon sets off for the Goodchilds fortress. The mission fails however once she gets a good look at her target initiating a flood of flashbacks that eerily suggest a past connection and complicate her sense of whats going on (to say nothing of the viewers). Action unexpectedly transitions into a love story as Aeon and Trevor form a sexually charged alliance and go into hiding from their respective factions while the treacherous Iago-like Oren seizes power. As weird a follow-up as it is to Therons Oscar-winning performance in ""Monster"" and the recent ""North Country"" pic reps an even more bewildering sophomore effort for helmer Karyn Kusama whose first film was the acclaimed Sundance prize-winner ""Girlfight."" Aside from the fact that both films are centered around super-aggressive femmes there are no stylistic or thematic links in evidence and certainly nothing that suggests an artistic progression. The more relevant credit here is that of Gale Ann Hurd the producer behind ""Aliens"" and ""The Terminator"" franchise. While the PG-13-rated ""Flux"" is no match for those films viscerally theres plenty of grotesquerie on display as Aeon must at various points dig bullets out of Trevors chest stab soldiers with a bloody shard of glass and -- in the most gratuitous burst of violence -- rip out an assailants hoop earring with her teeth. As for Theron she holds the screen as capably as ever and is called on to perform an impressive array of acrobatic stunts and still manage to keep her bangs dangling seductively in her face; like Angelina Jolie before her in the ""Tomb Raider"" movies she turns combat into the ultimate fashion statement. Csokas makes an intriguingly recessive foil as Trevor whose relative weakness compared to his partner makes for an amusing running gag. Most of the time however the utterly humorless and self-serious tone leaves one plenty of time to ponder the mysteries of the films universe -- why for example fashion sense has devolved so radically in 400 years or whether atmospheric nerve gas is to blame for the actors stilted portentous delivery. Embodying both these riddles is a strange oracular figure called the Keeper (Pete Postlethwaite wearing what appears to be a giant macaroni shell) whos at the heart of the government conspiracy. At the very least pic is certainly something to look at deploying showy but seamless visual effects and making inventive use of pools mirrors and other reflective surfaces -the means by which characters both spy on each other and look longingly into the past.

"Aeon Flux All Talk Little Action washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Aeon Flux All Talk Little Action A world askew Charlize Theron doesnt quite match the sizzle of the animated version of heroine Aeon Flux. (By Jasin Boland -- Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday December 3 2005 More than 40 people most of them men between 30 and 50 filed into the first show at a downtown theater yesterday to see her . That would be Aeon Flux the underground rebel in body-hugging black who fights for freedom in dark centuries ahead. Were the moviegoers there to see the screen version of the MTV animated episodes of the 1990s or to see Charlize Theron in black leather and spike heels? In ""Aeon Flux"" our title character (pronounced EE-on) works for the ""Monican"" underground against the police state society of Bregna some 400 years from now. After an ""industrial disease"" wiped out 99 percent of the worlds population in 2011 a leader known as Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) and his brother Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) developed a cure. Now there are 5 million in Bregna a city whose walls protect them (or so the State tells its people nudge nudge) from the blight outside. Trevor and Oren are still running the place hundreds of years later which says a lot about that magical cure but not much about their sense of coiffure. Theyre still sporting wet-gloss hairstyles from the early 1990s. Aeon gets her marching orders from the Handler played by Frances McDormand whose royalish garments and tousled red hair suggest Queen Elizabeth I caught in a wind tunnel. Aeons leader is tough but she has to be Bregna rules its inhabitants with sophisticated weaponry and ubiquitous camera surveillance. Aeons mission shes told is to destroy the central spying hub and assassinate Trevor ""Chairman"" Goodchild. Theres one problem as we soon find out. Trev and Aeon have a little ""history"" between them. With the exception of a few enjoyable action scenes such as when Aeon and fellow operative Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) flip and back-flip their way across a lethal garden of bullet-spewing trees and spikes disguised as blades of grass ""Aeon Flux"" is surprisingly draggy. Much of it is taken up with the mystical attraction between Aeon and Trevor with a lot of post-Philip K. Dick jabber about the dangers of dabbling with human nature. Theron is appropriately slinky and gymnastic. A former ballet dancer she performed a lot of her stunts even sustaining a neck injury at one point. But director Karyn (""Girlfight"") Kusamas tight angles and quick-flash editing dont permit us to appreciate that physical work anyway. Kusama seems to emphasize rendering Theron in perfect poses and lighting schemes as our heroine slinks through Goodchilds labyrinth of a fortress. As for the sexy factor -- the spectacle of a lithe power-babe in Samp;M attire -- its surprisingly muted. Where the animated Aeon strutted her stuff in risque straps and cups Therons version is far more conservative. The few erotically charged shots of her are coyly framed to keep the PG-13 rating and the theater temperature not much higher than lukewarm. It might be too much to call this movie "" Freon Flux"" but judging by the muted response of those moviegoers as they left the theater its hard to imagine the film ever being called too hot to handle. Aeon Flux (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content and sequences of violence.

"Aeon Flux | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; aeon-flux ) Aeon Flux (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Ill never understand why studios sometimes choose to withhold films from critics. The lack of advance screenings of Aeon Flux establishes an expectation that the film is likely to be tough to sit through. Its the studios way of throwing in the towel. Its a declaration of ""no confidence."" Imagine my surprise therefore to discover that Aeon Flux is not a bad movie. Okay its flawed and isnt a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but its perfectly watchable especially if viewed on a low-risk medium like DVD. And its better than about 1/3 of movies for which distributors hold advance screenings. Aeon Flux is a science fiction adventure film that includes a lot of intriguing ideas some of which are left underdeveloped. The script credited to Phil Hay amp; Matt Mandredi (based on Peter Chungs MTV animated shorts) doesnt seem to know whether it wants to be smart enough to appeal to serious-minded movie-goers or dumb enough to appeal to popcorn-munchers (apologies to those who straddle both categories). So it vacillates and ultimately that becomes its undoing. However except during a few routine action sequences that fail to raise a single nape hair Aeon Flux is never uninteresting. Some day someone is going to make a great feature about cloning. The Island wasnt it and neither is this. But both films pose some intriguing options that if properly developed could result in an eye-opener of a motion picture. Aeon Flux transpires in the year 2415. For 400 years since 99% of the human race was wiped out by a virus mankind has been living under the protection of the Goodchild regime in a walled city surrounded by the untamed wild. The population is static. There were 5 million survivors of the global plague in 2011 and there are 5 million men and women in 2415. As is the case with any totalitarian government there are rebels. Viewing their predicament as ""having traded freedom for a gilded cage"" their goals are to disrupt the accepted order and kill the ruler Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) and/or his second-in-command brother Oren (Jonny Lee Miller). The most dangerous of the rebels (who call themselves ""Monicans"") is Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron). Along with her sidekick Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) she accepts any mission offered by the Handler (Frances McDormand wearing an outrageous red wig that makes her look like the spawn of Raggedy Ann and Heat Miser from The Year Without a Santa Claus). When her beloved sister Una (Amelia Warner) is killed by government forces Aeon seizes the opportunity to assassinate Goodchild. But what she learns once she penetrates the Citadel changes her perspective about everything. Aeon Flux has a strong cast including Oscar winners Charlize Theron and Frances McDormand and Oscar nominees Sophie Okonedo and Pete Postlethwaite. Despite that there isnt a good performance to be found. Everyone appears to have had the life sucked out of them. Theyre doing the minimum necessary to collect their paychecks. Theron apparently put all of her efforts into doing her own stunts (she was seriously injured during filming) leaving little opportunity for emoting or delivering convincing dialogue. She flips and flops like a circus pro and some of her costumes dont leave much to the imagination. Nevertheless its tough to develop a strong allegiance with a character when the portrayal is bland. Early in the film theres a nice action scene featuring pods that spit darts and grass that might cut the lawn mower (rather than the other way around). After that the ""exciting"" stuff becomes routine running around blowing things up shooting etc. The ideas underlying Aeon Fluxs plot are the films strength and the filmmakers deserve some credit for doing more than paying lip service to them. Director Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) has a sense of visual flair. Many aspects of Aeon Fluxs look could have been derivative but are not. In truth although it would be difficult to laud this movie as being anything stronger than mediocre it is superior to what one would reasonably expect from something Paramount was trying to keep under wraps.

With slick flattened black hair that makes it look as if her stylist was going for that Louise Brooks-meets-Hitler mystique Theron is an arresting image but like everything else in Aeon Flux she?s stranded in a trashy and derivative glum zone of fashion-runway fascism. Ordered by her underground leader (Frances McDormand looking like she?s holding back a chuckle) to assassinate the head of the city (Marton Csokas) Aeon discovers that he?s not the baddie he seems -- and in fact that everyone including her is not quite what they seem. Based on the animated MTV series Aeon Flux has several entertaining action sequences like one in which Theron crawling like a spider dodges metal blades that pop out of the grass. But the movie while not as cheesy-bad as say Daredevil generates more motion than imagination. Theron plays Aeon as a reluctant cipher who yearns to get back to a real existence. By the end you?ll know the feeling.

"Girl Flight Aeon Flux doesnt suck. Slate Sign In Sign Up Girl Flight Aeon Flux doesnt suck. Girl Flight Aeon Flux doesnt suck. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateReel TimeRunning thoughts on movies and their makings.Dec. 2 2005 400 PM Girl Flight Aeon Flux doesnt suck By David Edelstein Aeon flex You wont be reading reviews of the dystopian sci-fi flick Aeon Flux (Paramount) in the papers today because it wasnt screened for the press--and given that it cost the GDP of a small country and that Charlize Theron and the director Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) are critics darlings this could mean but one thing A stinker. A weapon of mass destruction. A planet-killer. Folks Ill never understand studios. Aeon Flux is not that terrible. Its certainly more fun than a lot of films that get lovingly showcased. As Aeon Flux (yes thats the characters name) Theron wears a black Spandex stocking with a generous breach for cleavage and Kusama photographs her as a tantalizing art object elongated enough to compete with all the impressive modernist columns and with enough wriggly curves to vanquish them utterly. If she clearly doesnt perform the most acrobatic stunts theres no non sequitur when she lands--her endless legs spread wide her palms flat on the ground her eyes sparkling with amusement. She digs this action heroine thing. A few months ago Bill Maher expressed his disapproval with the poster of North Country--Theron with her face smudged and hair tied in a kerchief--by announcing ""All right Charlize we get it you can act. Now you can go back to being beautiful."" Hell be a pig in shit at Aeon Flux. Advertisement The plot unfolds in a post-viral-holocaust world in which the leaders of a small walled city (with the only humans left) are drifting into fascism supposedly in the name of the social good. People are disappearing. A large vessel like a Portuguese man o war floats overhead. And a rebel group has formed Im not sure of the spelling because I didnt get a press kit but its pronounced Manniken. Man-a-ken. Mannequin. Monitored by the government the members (Aeon is their best fighter) swallow pills that allow them to travel deep into their bodies (cue whooshing CSI-like into-the-body plunge) and confer with Frances McDormand as a futurist Queen of Diamonds. Between takes McDormand probably said ""Were a long way from the mines Charlize"" and they both probably had a good laugh. Aeon and her pal Sithandra (Sophie Okenedo) get assigned to leave the ""civilian area"" of the city and assassinate the handsome devil (Martin Csokas) in charge of all this... well whatever it is hes in charge of. Im not spilling the beans. Its here that the production designer Andrew McAlpine goes Le Corbusier gaga with all sorts of abstract ramps and passageways and pocked concrete walls. Really you could have a great time just laughing at the sets. The action is too chopped-up for my taste but its nicely storyboarded and cut together fluidly by Peter Honess and Plummy Tucker. (I love that name. Plummy Tucker.) Without giving anything away Aeon Flux finally embraces that favorite faux-utopian artificial-universe theme what Daniel Menaker called the need to go back to the natural world to ""break through into the real."" That its mostly zillion-dollar formulaic would-be blockbusters that tackle this issue doesnt necessarily invalidate it. And I hope Kusama is not excessively ridiculed for her sophomore stab at melding feminism with well being able to afford a swimming pool. Girls can fight and also have fun... 100 p.m. PT David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.
