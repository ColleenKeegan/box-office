PHOTO GALLERY Wanted ""Fight Club"" and ""The Matrix"" smash into each other in midair in a comic-book extravaganza about a meek office drone (James McAvoy) who gets taken in beaten down and bloodied up by a gang of brilliant assassins led by Angelina Jolie. Her name is Fox naturally and she explains to McAvoys Wesley Gibson - an accountant so anonymous that Googling himself yields nothing - that his father was a master killer rubbed out in a war involving a secret fraternity of assassin/weavers that goes back 1000 years.Badass weavers? Yup and the gang led by a toughened-up Morgan Freeman as Sloan want Wes to go after his fathers killer and restore the balance of power in the universe. Subtle dialogue and smarts are not on hand; three of the big applause lines are ""Go f - - - yourself"" ""F - - - you"" and ""Kill this motherf - - - er"" which is however kinda cool if only because Freeman himself says them. (Finally In your face Miss Daisy) But what ""Wanted"" offers is what the audience craves a stunt sundae with stunt sauce on the side and a side order of stunts. Staged at a ferocious pace and on a gigantic scale by Timur Bekmambetov the Russian director of ""Night Watch"" the action comes close to setting a new standard. In rescuing Wes from the killer Fox scoops him up in her Viper while moving sideways at about 70 mph. She then tears off under the El trains of Chicago laid flat-out on her back on the hood of her car firing at the guy chasing her. This is the car chase scene of the year so far and the movie has a lot more rounds left in its clip including a rousing train-smashing scene in Europe. Even a throwaway bit about shooting a tycoon inside his bulletproof limo is handled with wild wit The guy can only be shot through his sunroof which means the assassins car has to flip sideways over it. This movies got some wow. Wess training montage is brutal and bloody. His first lesson is how to take a beating while being tied down (reminiscent of the masochistic cleansing violence of ""Fight Club"") and then he submits meekly to being carved up by a mad butcher. Fox also tries to teach him how to surf trains and he takes a clobbering no one could survive but Wile E. Coyote. But - ingenious move - all of this bodily trauma can be reversed by a magical restorative bath that heals all bruises and instantly knits together shattered bones. (Questions that needs answering What are the limits to the bath? Can anyone with access to it ever die?) Making heavy use of ""Matrix"" bullet-time slo-mo - as well as that movies central idea of an ongoing ancient war none of us squares take much notice of - ""Wanted"" makes brash new advances in stunts many of which are bound to be imitated. Want to fire bullets that swerve around the person you dont want to hit so they can rip into the guy behind him? No problem thanks to a bend-it-like-Beckham arm technique that gives the bullets topspin. As for the old quandary of how to keep the hero stocked up on bullets even as dozens of cartridges are emptied ""Wanted"" makes the solution look easy Kill battalions of enemies while moving so fast that you pick up their dropped weapons before they hit the ground. Silly stuff but you have to admire the demon joy with which its all done. Even the ""Fight Club""-style one-liners about the fluorescent void of cubicle work (possibly the two movies are the only action flicks to mention IKEA) though lacking in wit capture something primeval about the leashed fury of the proletarian office male. Its a cunning idea to link ""Office Space""-style hell to the comic-book fantasy that within the pimpled adolescent lies a heros DNA. ""Wanted"" looks like the launching pad of a major franchise and a Michael Bay-size Hollywood career for Bekmambetov. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next CHRIS NOTH TO LEAVE Lamp;0 CI Read Next CHRIS NOTH TO LEAVE Lamp;0 CI Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46694 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 22725 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 16495 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Wanted with Angelina Jolie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Wanted with Angelina Jolie reviewed. Wanted with Angelina Jolie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 27 2008 321 PM The Dominatrix Angelina Jolie crushes James McAvoy like a bug in Wanted. By Dana Stevens Wanted When I first heard that Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy would be paired up in an action movie this summer I remember scoffing about what an unsexy couple theyd make. I believe my exact words were ""Shell crush him like a bug."" ""Sounds pretty sexy to me"" said my interlocutor giving me an unsolicited yet bracing glimpse into his fantasy life. He was right. For those whose fantasies include being crushed like bugs by Angelina Jolie (or beaten senseless by hulking Russian thugs or forced to use dead pigs for target practice by Morgan Freeman) Wanted(Universal Pictures) is a compendium of bedside erotica. I dont know when Ive seen a mainstream movie that so explicitly caters to the Samp;M niche. And the chemistry of the central couple which seemed destined to bring the movie down is instead the hottest thing in this effects-laden but ultimately empty film. Advertisement McAvoy is the delicate-faced slight-framed Scotsman who seems born to play victims and pushovers. (In the last few years hes been Idi Amins personal physician in The Last King of Scotland the sacrificial faun in The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe and the young swain unjustly accused of child rape in Atonement.) And Jolie is well Angelina Jolie the closest thing we have to a real-life superhero. Just think about it She seems to be everywhere at once never ages travels the world crusading for right and can easily be pictured crouched atop a gargoyle on the Chrysler Building. Perhaps the ultimate coup of Jolie stunt casting was the role of Grendels mother the gorgeous she-monster of Robert Zemeckis Beowulf. But Fox the infallible superassassin she plays here comes in as a close second. Wanteds plot is an overripe brew of elements from The Matrix Fight Club and The Da Vinci Code. Centuries ago it seems a guild of ancient weavers formed a secret society known as the Fraternity a band of killers with otherworldly gifts (they can curve the trajectory of a bullet for example or heal their wounds overnight in tubs filled with a special molten wax). A textile mill in modern-day Chicago is the last outpost for the society whose members consult the Loom of Fate (no seriously) for woven-in-code tips on whom to kill next. None of this has anything to do with Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) a timid accountant prone to anxiety attacks until hes spectacularly kidnapped by Fox (Jolie) and forced to undergo Fraternity hazing--that is training. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Its during these long training sequences that the movies semisecret BDSM subtext is at its clearest. ""Not too tight right?"" asks a Fraternity minion tying the wimpy Wesley to a chair for one of many brutal interrogations as Fox looks coolly on. ""No thats ... nice"" replies our hero pausing just long enough to get a big laugh from the audience. Plenty of movies (most disturbingly the new breed of ""extreme horror"" movies like Hostel and Saw) offer kicks by portraying the suffering of others. But watching someone get his kicks from suffering--especially when that someone is the male action hero with whom the male target audience is presumably meant to identify--is a perverse and refreshing turnabout. When Wesley in his words ""grows a pair"" and becomes a full-fledged member of the Fraternity bending bullets and decoding fabric swatches with the best of them Wanted gets less kinky and a lot less interesting. Timur Bekmambetov the Russian director of the visually spectacular thrillers Night Watch and Day Watch loves to tease the audience with slo-mo reverse motion close-up bullet-cam and other hammy tricks. Some of these impress by their sheer audacity After a bad guy gets shot for example we watch the bullet travel backwards out of his skull and back through space and time into the gun barrel of the man who shot him. Wanted is based on a series of comic books by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones that are apparently so dark and amoral as to make this movies mayhem seem positively Amish. Myself I prefer action films in which the stunts however unlikely adhere to at least some of the laws of physics. But if the graphic-novel-style hyperviolence of Sin City or 300 is your thing go ahead and knock yourself out. Or let Angelina do it for you ... It feels so much nicer that way.

Inside his swank office he detects danger from outside and in a moment his colleague has been shot. Running toward the office window he leaps out head first his face a mesh mosaic of broken plastic as if it were a crushed stained-glass mask. He lands on the adjacent building the shots came from using his own artillery to dispatch several of his would-be killers including one with a bullet that can turn corners. Alone and triumphant he hears a voice from afar saying ""They were just decoys"" and BANG hes killed by a shell that enters his skull from the back and explodes out of his forehead. Then like a missile shifting into reverse the bullet retraces its path returning through the executives head quickly backtracking across town into a dark room and into the rifle from which it was fired. The play of shadows allows us a glimpse of the killer; his name is Cross. As if in instant celebration of the Supreme Courts ruling on a citizens right to bear arms -- and of the newly articulated ""individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation"" -- the burly new fantasy Wanted reveals the magic that can blossom when you put a gun in the hand of a meek wage slave and tell him he was born to be a righteous killer. Directed at a pitch of gritty giddiness by the Kazakhstan-born Timur Bekmambetov who did the DVD faves Night Watch and Day Watch this hard-R splatter-fest about a team of sanctified assassins is also the summers zazziest action movie. In the story based on Mark Millars 2003 miniseries for Top Cow comics and adapted for the screen by Derek Haas Michael Brandt and Chris Morgan the white-collar drudge is Wesley Gibson (Scots actor James McAvoy) whose life is a conspiracy of indignities. In a job where hes badgered by his fat-cow boss he reads a dense computer page and his brain isolates the words ""why? ""are? ""you? ""here?"". His girlfriend is having sex with his best friend and Wesley pays for the condoms his friend will use to betray him. Even his ATM sasses him. ""Insufficient funds"" the text brays at him. ""Youre an asshole."" When he was an infant his father disappeared and Wesley cant blame him. He doesnt want to be around himself either. And yet depressed to the point of inertia he cant summon the resolve to commit suicide. Then behind in line at a store a stunning woman -- the Angelina Jolie-like Fox (Angelina Jolie) -- whispers ""Your father was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived. The man who killed him is over there."" Over there is Cross (Thomas Kretchmann) triggering much gunplay. BANG Fox drags the terrified Wesley into a sports car and takes him on a chase through Chicago traffic that climaxes with her avoiding the pursuing killer by somersaulting her car sideways over other vehicles. Its a talent Wesley will acquire when hes assigned to shoot a businessman in a limo with bullet-proof windows. Too bad the mans sun roof was open. BANG Wesley has been recruited into the Fraternity which its leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman in another of his God roles) explains is a thousand-year-old sect of killers whose sacred mission is to end the lives of evil people before they can commit their worst crimes ""You kill one maybe save a thousand."" (Its a little like the Pre-Crime Unit in Minority Report.) The team includes a specialist in gun lore (Common) and a fat man (Konstantin Khabensky) whos sharp with knives. But Fox is the star and in poor confused Wesley Sloan believes he hes found another one -- that the lad must have powers passed down by his father. To prove it he puts Wesley through a punishing initiation that involves getting smacked around slashed open and to recuperate lying in a tub of goo. Sure enough Wesley has the goods. Now all he has to do is kill the man who killed his father. THE WIZARD OF ODD It takes a while for the Fraternity to transform Wesley from dweeb to demi-deity. For the first third of the movie he clings to his wimpiness threatening to break the All-time Whining record held by the Justin Long character in Live Free and Die Hard. Moviegoers may start to wonder if McAvoy has imported to Wanted the softness of his roles in the more elevated Brit films Atonement The Last King of Scotland and Becoming Jane. But he eventually gets the hang of movie heroism. Like Tobey Maguire plucked from indie films to play Spider-Man McAvoy is the sensitive nerd who when shirtless brandishes the bulked-up chest a few months with a stern trainer can produce. Thats how you get yanked from the decorous little world of Masterpiece Theatre-type dramas and morphed into a summer blockbusters mean malefactor. In the middle of one impossible assignment Wesley asks Fox ""Have you ever thought of being somebody else -- somebody normal?"" She ponders for a beat and replies ""No."" The same question and answer might apply to Jolie. The contours of her face and body are improbable arresting and unique; shes simply not designed to play ordinary people. We dont doubt her skills as a serious actress but shes much more seductive and satisfying as a fantasy or cartoon character. Or a saint from some fertility cult Holy Jolie.

Starring James McAvoy Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are two ways equally valid of looking at ""Wanted"" (1) as a go-for-broke action movie of mixed quality and modest but definite entertainment value or (2) as a sick sick movie for a sick sick public. So this is a review in two parts. But to give you a teaser of part 2 think about this If a patient presented the story of ""Wanted"" to a psychiatrist as a fantasy or dream the psychiatrist would think ""This person is in trouble."" But take this fantasy and present it in the form of a movie and have millions of people cheer it and identify with it and no one recognizes the pathology. Theres a 5-ton elephant in the room and everybody thinks its a desk lamp. Every society and every era has its versions of rags-to-riches sagas and stories of emerging manhood - because they need them. Maybe ""Wanted"" is ours. James McAvoy plays an accounts manager who starts the movie with nothing. His lowly life is defined by the cramped cubicle in which he works the lousy apartment in which he lives and the girlfriend whos cheating on him with - guess who? - his best friend. Its a go-nowhere existence with no joy and no prospects and to make things even worse he suffers from tremendous rushes of anxiety. McAvoy is very good at looking nervous and making his face turn red. He got lots of practice in ""The Last King of Scotland."" Then one fine day as in all fables opportunity prevents itself in the form of what seems at first to be hardship. Some guy starts shooting at him. And a glamorous woman starts shooting back. In a terrific little chase that follows Angelina Jolie (as Fox) races a red sports car through city streets shoots out the window and in one particularly spectacular moment flips the car over and around a bus. All the while mild-mannered Wesley (that is McAvoy) sitting in the passenger seat holds on and screams. Soon Wesley is told what everyone hopes someday to hear He is much more than he thinks he is. He has enormous gifts. Indeed what he regards as his nervous disorder is in reality a sign of the great talent that will enable him to be all that he can be ... as a trained elite assassin going around killing complete strangers. Like most action movies which are usually big on premise and weak on execution ""Wanted"" is better in the beginning and goes south in its second half. But throughout it has three things going for it McAvoy who is very easy to like. Jolie whose stillness is always fascinating to read. And Morgan Freeman who as the head of the covert assassins unit is a number of interesting things at once all of them intentional creepy paternal convincing capable and thoroughly not reassuring. Eventually the movie gets lost in bloodbath sequences and in the silly notion that bullets if fired by the right person can be made to bend and make turns. (This is the gang that cant shoot straight on purpose.) The violence gradually takes on a fetishistic quality with director Timur Bekmambetov lavishing loving footage on bullets slowly entering and then coming out of various heads. Ultimately watching ""Wanted"" feels like being privy to somebody elses unwholesome fantasy one youd rather not know about. Which brings us to part 2 What is this fantasy saying? I suppose few people who see ""Wanted"" will bother to think about it. The movie is if anything an invitation not to think. But the movie is saying something loud and clear all the same Theres nothing worse than being a loser. Nothing. Being a killer being immoral wreaking havoc on humanity - none of this is worse than having no money a lousy job and a cheating girlfriend. The movie even goes out of its way to emphasize this point with its curtain line. ""Wanted"" is presented as the story of a nobody who becomes a somebody. Wesley is a success story. To appreciate how weird this is imagine Cinderella the classic downtrodden protagonist coming into her own by becoming a hundred times more evil destructive and heedless than her wicked stepsisters. Imagine passing that off as a happy ending and a happy end point for the character. Explain that to a child whose perception hasnt yet been mangled in the gears of life. Or to put it another way how powerless - how threatened how desperate how beat up how angry how precarious how hungry for success and in despair of ever achieving it - do people have to be to invest emotionally in the story of a nobody who becomes a murderer? Id say ""A lot"" and that the sound of cheering youll hear tonight in the multiplex is not good news. -- Advisory Strong language and extreme violence.

(R) Universal (104 min.) Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. With James McAvoy Angelina Jolie Morgan Freeman. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS Some people lead lives of quiet desperation. Wesley Gibson leads no life at all. His apartment is a tumble-down flat. His job is cubicle-monkey servitude moving numbers from one spreadsheet to another. His girlfriend treats him like a worm and makes love to his best friend. Thirty years down. Only 50 or so more to go. But then Wesley is reunited with the father who left him at birth -- and discovers his dad is a high-caliber international assassin. And that this is a family business hes now expected to take over. Goodbye Dun amp; Bradstreet hello Smith amp; Wesson. This is the set up for the new ""Wanted"" -- based loosely on a comic book -- and like most comic-book movies its a junk-food feast of wish fulfillment. One day youre dying a slow corporate death; the next day youre living the fast high life firing guns and romancing women who look like Angelina Jolie. Its a goofy giddy bit of escapism. Yet as silly as the movie gets -- and theres an awful lot of blather about secret societies and Zen and the art of assassination -- its never stupid. The script by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas functions as a sort of ""Fight Club"" light (""Lite Club""?) with snarky narration and sarcastic surrealism. The direction by Timur Bekmambetov of the ""Night Watch"" series is as mad as ""The Matrix"" with bullets flying backward and cameras zooming like rockets. This has been the summer of the Nerd Triumphant -- with slim intellectuals like Robert Downey Jr. and Edward Norton turning themselves into the superheroes -- but James McAvoy is clearly the new standard bearer. In previous movies -- ""Atonement"" ""Becoming Jane"" ""The Last King of Scotland"" even ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" which he trotted through as Mr. Tumnus -- hes embodied the charming but rather hapless hero. Here in his first big American popcorn movie he begins with that -- but then builds on it as some peculiar tutors come out of the shadows and he learns to follow in his fathers bloody footsteps. Many of those training scenes are delirious at best -- one of Wesleys tutorials seems to consist of getting his nose broken over and over -- but Morgan Freeman adds his usual gravitas as the leader of this league of assassins. And Jolie -- not only sporting her real tattoos for once but some fake ones as well -- brings all of her sexy movie-star power to bear on the role of the lethal Fox an assassin who (for now at least) is Wesleys one friend. Bekmambetov gives the film a couple of stirring set pieces. In one Wesley and Fox -- who relax by surfing the Chicago el -- careen around town in a sports car reducing much of the city to rubble; in another a massive train goes hurtling into a gorge (even as the assassins still pursue their quarry). There are also several rather nasty knife fights and -- most pleasurably for the target audience perhaps -- a chance for Wesley and Fox to make his bad old girlfriend awfully jealous. Does the movie make sense? Not an awful lot. And its not just that it pretends that a skilled enough marksman could fire a bullet so it travels in a perfect circle; its that its assassinations are ridiculously overcomplicated and that its assassins behavior isnt consistent or even discernable. But then dreams arent often logical either and ""Wanted"" pretends to be nothing more. And for a certain kind of action-movie fan -- usually male young and put-upon -- its a dream come true. Rating note The film contains extreme violence sexual situations and nudity. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 26 2008 523 PM That Timur Bekmambetovs amped-up action flick ""Wanted"" makes absolutely no sense is entirely irrelevant. Your brain in fact can take a two-hour hiatus. But your adrenal glands will be working overtime. Our tour guide through the madness is beaten-down office drone Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy). Nothing interesting ever happens in his life - until the night he meets Angelina Jolies aptly named Fox. Fox it turns out belongs to a centuries-old fraternity of assassins and she and her boss (Morgan Freeman) claim Wesleys father did too. Now they announce its time for him to join the club. Obviously hes a little put off by this command. But you dont argue with hit men and its not like hes got anything better going on. So after a rigorous training program that nearly kills him he discovers that he is in fact good at something. And that something is shooting a bullet through any brain he desires. From head-spinning car chases to a naked Jolie Bekmambetov - best known for the Russian blockbuster ""Night Watch"" - keeps his audience on visual overload. Really he doesnt so much direct the movie as edit it into submission. Theres barely a frame that doesnt look stretched smashed or otherwise harassed. Imagine ""The Matrix"" on speed and youre halfway there. You could fairly call ""Wanted"" which is loosely based on a graphic novel of the same name too long too dumb and too outlandish. Or you could keep stuffing your face with popcorn and appreciate Bekmambetovs determination to give us our moneys worth. And he does get points for casting the talented McAvoy who deserves a chance to break out after supporting bigger stars in movies like ""Atonement."" Also wise was the decision to balance McAvoys everyman meekness with Jolies intimidating cool. Whether speeding through tunnels or outracing a train she meets every escalating threat with an imperious stare and a massive gun. Our era could use a few more iconic action heroes and right now no one fits the bill better than she does. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Wanted (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Wanted (R)  The actions fun to watch but theres not a thread of sense. James McAvoy stars as Wesley in the action-thriller ""Wanted."" Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald Once upon a time -- a thousand years ago in fact -- a clan of weavers banded together to form an assassins club and presumably knit some nice sweaters in their down time. They do not kill randomly. They take their orders from a magical loom of fate. If your name pops up via the looms secret code consider yourself dead. Such is the Monty Python-esque background in the violent adventure Wanted which mixes buckets of gore with bizarre notes of whimsy and unintentional comedy. Adapted from a series of comic books by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones the film hardly aims to be serious entertainment and to its credit its never uninteresting visually what with all the people crashing through windows and bullets that can curve around obstacles to find a target. Its got an uplifting take-this-job-and-shove-it moment that will be pleasing to any unhappily employed individual. The loom however is only the beginning of the silliness. James McAvoy (Atonement) plays Wesley Gibson an account manager in a hellishly dull job who suffers over a cheating girlfriend and a nasty boss. Hes so insignificant (or so he thinks) his name doesnt even come up on a Google search. But then hes singled out by the sinewy tattooed Fox (Angelina Jolie) and brought into the fold of the Fraternity the aforementioned weavers who operate out of a working textile mill and drill Wesley through vicious beatings stabbings and lectures on a mystical force that sounds suspiciously like the one on which Luke Skywalker relies. Wesleys father much like Lukes was once important in the struggle between good and evil. He was a peerless Fraternity operative and new boss Morgan Freeman thinks Wes can follow in his dads bloody footsteps. Freeman incidentally is forced to embarrass himself by uttering the sentence We call this the loom of fate. The loom for the record knows binary code. Wesley gets banged up but turns into a deadly force and is never forced to crochet. McAvoy is an unlikely tough guy but hes an engaging enough actor to pull off the role especially when he takes the time to wink at it. Jolie who pretty much sticks to nonchallenging action-figure parts these days doesnt do much except smile enigmatically and fire a weapon. The point of the film however is not the people in it but a series of rousing chases in cars on a train through the mill. When the characters are on the run Wanted can be a bloodthirsty crowdpleaser a passable action flick to while away the summer hours. When theyre explaining themselves you almost wish theyd stuck to their original calling and made rugs not war.

"Wanted Bullet-bending thriller | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsWanted Bullet-bending thriller Russian director Timur Bekmambetov obviously flunked physics at school. On second thought based on the mystical science of his bullet-bending new thriller Wanted its possible the guy is a real Einstein. Angelina Jolie bends bullets and James McAvoy to her will in Wanted.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 27 2008 Wanted (out of 4)Starring James McAvoy Angelina Jolie Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp . Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Russian director Timur Bekmambetov obviously flunked physics at school.On second thought based on the mystical science of his bullet-bending new thriller Wanted its possible the guy is a real Einstein. Maybe hes discovered hitherto unknown loopholes to natural laws.Hes for certain flouting one immutable edict. Its the unwritten rule where a filmmaker makes a name as an innovator in his or her native country only to come to Hollywood to turn into the worst kind of factory hack.The Kazakhstan-born Bekmambetov whose previous films Night Watch and Day Watch set records in Russia and won admirers elsewhere is no deer in Tinseltowns headlights. He hasnt just made a thriller with Wanted hes redefined the genre.The action scenes will goose people the same way The Matrix did a decade ago when the Wachowski Bros. introduced ""bullet time"" to turn physics into a stunt actor.Bekmambetovs slugs fired with furious intent by James McAvoy Angelina Jolie and other members of Wanteds blue-chip cast look like they came out of a Looney Tunes cartoon. Depending on their whim these bullets are able to turn corners pass in slo-mo through skulls (all too often alas) and also fly with unerring accuracy from distances only a mind reader could fathom. They can even meet each other in midair for a most penetrating pas de deux or deliver tiny little Hallmark greetings like ""Goodbye.""If only the story were so nimble but it does have a few fancy moves. McAvoys Wesley Gibson is straight from the reluctant-hero playbook an office drone and wimp who is intimidated by his doughnut-scarfing boss and cuckolded by his so-called best friend. He is natch just the guy youd figure to be a sharpshooting assassin which is why hes suddenly swept up by Jolies aptly named Fox and conscripted to join a 1000-year-old organization of hitmen called The Fraternity.Its actually more of a vigilante squad since The Fraternitys avowed mission is to rub out bad guys everywhere to keep the world humming along peacefully.These hitmen and hitwomen are led by a dapper gent named Sloan played by Morgan Freeman in one of the few tough-guy roles hes had of late - and this is the only one I can recall where he uses profanity.The Fraternity has been distracted from its noble work by the unsanctioned executions by an ex-member named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) who has all of the skills but apparently none of the restraint of the Frat boys and girls. He demonstrates his lethal lawlessness early on by taking out a Fraternity member who is later revealed to have a connection to Wesley giving us serious reason for the timid mans induction to the team. Another reason comes when Wesley realizes as with all such movies that theres more than one fox in the Frathouse.We also meet The Fraternitys guru a recluse named Pekwarsky who lives in a European fortress. Terence Stamp plays him as if he just strolled over from the set of Get Smart. This is the kind of hokery youd expect from a story drawn from a graphic novel and scripted by the same scribes who worked on 310 to Yuma and two sequels to The Fast and the Furious.But who wants to quibble over physics or logic when the magic is this mesmerizing? Scotlands McAvoy may not have been anyones first choice as an action hero but hes good enough that you could see him as a future James Bond should Daniel Craig ever tire.Sporting even more tattoos than usual Jolie cuts an intimidating ice queen as Fox but she adds a certain joie de vivre to the proceedings.Save for a pokey mid-section Wanted moves at a bullets pace. But all this cleverness and speed comes with a price. Its an intensely violent movie owing as much or more to gory video games as to anything Sam Peckinpah or George Romero ever dreamed up.And it has the novelty of a narrator who doesnt just address the audience he taunts it ""What the f--k have you done lately?""Lets just hope the movie remains in the realm of entertainment and doesnt give anybody any ideas.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

If youre not -- if you somehow missed Night Watch and Day Watch -- lets put it this way. Theyre sick. Theyre absurdly violent visually overcooked and shot through with a madhouse delirium that teeters between giddy self-importance and sideshow humor. They are not however dull and neither is Wanted Bekmambetovs first English-speaking contribution to the realm of ultraviolence and a film almost beyond the careful parsings of criticism. It does what it does. It is what it is. Which is as I mentioned sick. A lot of money effort creativity and megabytes went into the tale of Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) a beyond-pathetic cubicle drone who joins a league of super-assassins and thus learns to bend bullets around Angelina Jolie among other things. It features darkly perverted humor and enough hyperbolized Matrix-y follow-the-bullet action setpieces to give the Xbox demographic major ya-yas. Also those in favor of glam sadism should enjoy if thats the word extended sequences dramatizing Wesleys de-sensitization to pain. There is an undeniable coolness factor in some of effects including several head-on collisions between racing bullets and a scene at the end when a single plug passes from temple to temple through a circle of killers. That one will be YouTubed to death Im sure. But whats the point of this happy exercise? To just kill everyone in sight? Originally yes. If you go back to the pitch-black source material an F-word-intensive comic-book series by Mark Millar youll find a completely amoral protagonist in a brotherhood of super-powered archvillains who go about whacking anyone they please. The whole thing stood firmly outside the moral sphere but inside the universe of superheroes who had been systematically wiped out by the bad guys. This adaptation -- written by 310 to Yumas Michael Brandt and Derek Haas along with Cellulars Chris Morgan -- boots the superpowers and laissez-faire criminality for some narrative hooey over a Loom of Fate. Based no joke in a textile factory the Fraternity is actually an ancient brotherhood of weavers who translate swatches of cloth into a binary code that spells out the names of future serial murderers and other unlucky schlubs appointed to die. When the Fickle Finger of Fate falls on a slick customer in a limo (to name just one example) Wesley vaults his car over the fellow and picks him off through the moon roof. All in a days work. Of course its not that simple. There is the matter of Wesleys dad a legendary assassin who gave Wes a most-excellent ability to shoot the wings off flies take that Raid. And there is the matter of Sloan the Fraternitys head honcho and chief swatch-reader -- portrayed by Hollwoods go-to guy for righteous mysticism Morgan Freeman. He could play this role in his sleep. Maybe he does. The plot unfolds in twisty-turny fashion complete with a few what-no-way surprises. Terence Stamp arrives bless him. And by the close Wesley has indeed transformed into a raging instrument of destruction. McAvoy dives head-first into Wesleys every emotional state from his weenie white-collar origins to his pyrotechnic venting in the climax and stands in stark contrast to the blank-faced Jolie. Think of her Lara Croft flicks; now subtract the fey British accent and all trace of affect and you get the idea. But no one comes to a movie like Wanted looking for emotional resonance. Theyre looking for bling which in this genre means plenty of stylized butchery. Its a chance to watch a bullet explode from the forehead of a killer -- and an invitation to laugh at the spectacle.

By Peter Rainer June 28 2008 Save for later Saved Quite an exit David Patrick OHaras Mr. X bursts through a skyscraper window in Wanted a luridly violent film about an assassin in training. universal pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The battle of the summer comic-book - oops graphic-novel - movies continues with ""Wanted."" I enjoyed ""Iron Man"" mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. and tolerated the far-from-incredible ""Incredible Hulk."" The first major Hollywood feature from the Russian director Timur Bekmambetov whose ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"" were the two highest-grossing films in Russian history ""Wanted"" is easily the most cinematically expert of the current crop of comic-book extravaganzas.But in a way thats whats wrong with it. The films high proficiency is at the service of a concept that can most accurately be defined as sadomasochistic. I thought these comic movies were supposed to be fun. The only people likely to devour ""Wanted"" are wolverines.Once again we are presented with a scrawny dweeb Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) who breaks out of his humdrum existence to become a hero - or antihero. Or not-quite-superhero. Whatever. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Comic-book movies are always quick to remind us that deep down many of their headliners are ordinary human beings like you and me. This isnt quite accurate unless you happen to believe that a bloated green giant or a kid whizzing between skyscrapers in a spider suit or a munitions dealer outfitted like a megacrustacean are human just because they dont defy the laws of physics. (Which come to think of it they often do anyway.) But I digress. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Wanted Wesleys dreary office job confines him to a cubicle where his boss harasses him mercilessly. He chomps vegan tofu wraps and gulps vast quantities of panic-attack pills. It turns out his father was a member of an elite cadre of covert assassins known as The Fraternity an ancient society of weavers that no doubt would give Opus Dei the willies. By minutely examining hidden textile patterns in the Loom of Fate (dont ask) they can divine who is fated to imperil the planet and then proceed to assassinate forthwith. The Frat Rats go by such Cosa Nostra-ish names as the Repairman the Butcher and the Exterminator. Theres also a sorority sister the appropriately named Fox played by Angelina Jolie in quasi-Mrs. Smith/Lara Croft mode. (Her screen time is shorter than the ads would have you believe.)Inevitably Morgan Freeman plays the capo of the Frats and he does so utilizing those plummy godlike tones on which hes presumably taken out a patent. Freeman is a great actor but in recent years hes begun his descent into Orson Welles territory - his acting is becoming all about his pipes.I suspect the reason this cabal is named The Fraternity is to justify the heavy-duty hazing that Wesley is subjected to. This is the sadomasochistic part I was warning you about. In most movies about heroes theres a certain amount of trial-by-fire stuff but in ""Wanted"" Wesley is pummeled basted sliced and diced until he resembles a side of rare roast beef - and thats just by his friends. Its one thing I suppose to be subjected to this sort of thing in a comic book. At least there the bloodletting stays on the page. (The wildly popular comic series is by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones.) But violence in the movies no matter how many CGI effects are utilized cant help but be far more luridly realistic. And in the case of ""Wanted"" to what end?Wesleys rite of passage into manhood is synonymous with becoming a lethal killer and Bekmambetov seems perfectly OK with this. His real interest in making this movie is working up more effective ways of depicting splatter. Hes trying to one-up Quentin Tarantino and the Wachowski brothers.If were lucky ""Wanted"" wont be. Grade C- (Rated R for strong bloody violence throughout; pervasive language; and some sexuality.)

Wanted Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2008) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wanted-2008,200,wanted16,wanted,rogerebert
"Wanted | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wanted ) Wanted (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Wanted provides the jolt of adrenaline one expects from solid summer entertainment. It exists solely to keep the heart pounding as it shifts from one gear to the next decelerating only when exposition demands a reduction in pace. The movie marries the superhero origin film with the revenge thriller blending them with hints of the frenzied intensity embodied by 300 and the visual orchestrations of The Matrix. The storyline while not Pulitzer material is strong enough to keep the average viewer involved. But this is one of those experiences where the brain is not the primary organ engaged by what flashes on the screen in the darkness. The backstory of Wanted postulates that theres a thousand-year old secret society of assassins called the Fraternity whose elite membership have an unsurpassed aptitude when it comes to killing. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) a mild-mannered accounts manager is about to come face-to-face with the truth about his absentee father. Dear old Dad it seems was a member of the Fraternity and he passed his genes to his son. Now following Dads betrayal and murder at the hands of the renegade Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) the Fraternity wants Wesley to join their number. He is recruited by the head honcho Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and the hard-to-resist and appropriately named Fox (Angelina Jolie). She has everything but her own news network. Wesleys training is hard-ass but after a long montage that might as well be set to ""Gonna Fly Now"" or ""Eye of the Tiger"" hes ready to take his place alongside Fox and do some train surfing and lip locking. One could argue that the most important passages in Wanted are among the calmest and most understated the opening scenes of Wesley toiling away at the office crammed into a cubicle under the thumb of an intolerant bully of a boss while his ""best friend"" sneaks away to screw Wesleys girlfriend. This is the part of the movie that humanizes him - that makes us feel like we know him. Its hard to identify with a guy who can slow time and fire a bullet that curves around a corner but its difficult not to empathize with someone whos working a dead-end job in a life thats going nowhere. Theres a lot of razzle-dazzle and flash in Wanted; the only reason it means something is because were rooting for Wesley. Director Timur Bekmambetov showed in Night Watch that he knows how to do some arresting stuff with his cameras. The flaw with that film is its cold clinical attitude toward the characters. Here the approach is warmer and more inviting. Wesley represents our point of entry into this world where the laws of physics (and sometimes logic) have been suspended. Hes the everyman who discovers hes more than he thought he was. Hes Peter Parker with an attitude. And face it who wants Mary Jane Watson when you can have Fox? Angelina Jolie has always oozed sex appeal but shes never been able to match badass with dominatrix quite like this. Jolie doesnt have any qualms about showing off her body nor should she considering how well sculpted it is. James McAvoys American accent is a little flawed but his transformation from dweeb to assassin is believable. Morgan Freeman adds a touch of class to things (much as he does with nearly every movie hes in). Theres something perversely delicious however about getting to hear Easy Reader say two of George Carlins seven words that cant be spoken on television. The action sequences are choreographed like dances of bullets metal blood and sweat. Cars fly upside down at impossible angles. People treat the tops of speeding trains like race tracks. And theres blood and viscera everywhere. Wanted earns its R-rating with the tracking of every bullet as it rips through flesh muscle and bone. The films debt to the The Matrix with its slow-motion violence and general setup is undeniable. 300 is also a forerunner. While theres no specific linkage to the story of the indomitable Spartans theres a strong sense that those who appreciated the early 2007 hit will approve of Wanted. The stories may be vastly different but the vibe is similar. The films sense of style is going to capture the praise of some who might normally not applaud a summer movie fueled by adrenaline and testosterone. But Wanted manages to deliver what action fans crave while still maintaining a veneer of artfulness. There are times when the film is flat-out silly (such as the spinning car assassination) but thats part of the movies charm. At its worst Wanted is never boring. At its best it can be damn close to intoxicating. One word written without apology describes it best fun.

This magnificent animated feature from Pixar starts on such a high plane of aspiration and achievement that you wonder whether the wonder can be sustained. But yes it can. The director Andrew Stanton supported by a special-forces battalion of artists voice artists and computer wizards has conjured up a tender comical love story between two robots whose feelings for each other seem as nuanced and deep as any youre likely to encounter these days in live-action drama. Better still their story plays out in two disparate worlds that amount to a unified vision stunning and hilarious in equal measure of what we human creatures have been up to and where it could get us. The heros name is an acronym of his task Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class thus WALL-E. Hes a garbage compactor with a pair of swiveling binoculars for a head a square metal body and twin tracks that make him look like a midget tank. He was designed to stuff the discarded stuff of our consumer society into himself squeeze it into dense cubes and stack the cubes into piles. By his own design though WALL-E has become over time an endlessly curious garbologist who collects objects that strike his fancy -- an eggbeater a sheet of bubble wrap a Rubiks cube a paddle-ball a Zippo lighter a brassiere (he experiments with it by putting it over his eyes) a diamond ring in a velvet box (he tosses the ring and keeps the box). And theres been plenty of time for his curiosity to evolve WALL-E has been alone on Earth for seven centuries ever since the last humans left and neglected to switch him off. Its become a commonplace of contemporary screenwriting classes that a movie must grab its audience within the first few minutes if not seconds; thats why so many of them start with cliched explosions collisions or violent combat. But no film-school formula could have envisioned the quietly magical pull of this films opening sequence. The humor is so delectable the images are so powerful and darkly beautiful and the music provides such a haunting counterpoint that Id love to describe the whole experience in minute detail. Best that you make your own discoveries though. (""You"" meaning adults and kids alike. This is a film for the ages -- just about all ages.) Suffice it to say that WALL-E whose forbears include diminutive personages from ""Star Wars"" and ""Short Circuit"" continues to toil like a half-pint Sisyphus in a bleak cityscape dominated by garbage -- most of it piled presumably by him into towers that might be mistaken for skyscrapers encrusted with barnacles. ENLARGE He works that is until love blasts in from outer space in the person of a robot named EVE (Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). That she is a she is instantly clear. That she is just as clearly a person is a triumph of graphic design and enchanting animation for EVE is a minimalist from the top of her levitating ovoid head to the bottom of her conical abdomen which doesnt need a leg to stand on because all of her levitates ever so lightly. (She is also one powerful female when the spirit moves her to unleash her laser gun.) EVEs sleek white contours bespeak both egg and iPod. (Which is fitting because whenever WALL-E reboots he emits an unmistakable Mac start-up sound.) Her facial features are limited to a pair of oval blue eyes behind a black oval screen but those come-hither orbs are so expressive that WALL-E cant help but come with her court her protect her and finally follow her back to the galaxy whence she came. At this point the story takes a new tack expressed in a new palette -- colors close enough to Necco to be cheerful but also borderline grotesque. And well they might be since this is the big reveal about the fate of humankind or what is left of it aboard a spaceship that resembles a giant cruise liner. Most of the revelations are brilliant both as satire and entertainment. Here again though youll want to figure things out on your own so I wont discuss EVEs animating program which is rigidly simple until she overrides it or WALL-Es role in regreening the earth which is crucial albeit inadvertent. But I will tell you that humankinds evolution as foretold by Mr. Stanton and his colleagues is a blissfully inspired reductio ad absurdum -- or more accurately inflatio ad absurdum -- of the ethos of consumption that now sustains the economies of prosperous nations. Part of the genius of ""WALL-E"" is the seamlessness of its tone -- always entertaining yet also polemic without being preachy. Heedless consumption is its satiric target a healed planet is the locus of its hope. But the healing cant be achieved without bringing the consumption under control. That point is tacitly made by the films opening shot. Rows of wind turbines standing motionless beneath sulfurous skies announce that green technologies will avail us little if the planet is engulfed by flood tides of garbage. Still hope carries the day in a fable that seems perfectly pitched for our times. (And carries it beyond the closing shot in an end-title sequence that limns as if on the Lascaux cave walls humanitys return from its second childhood.) ENLARGE The animated robots EVE and WALL-E in WALL-E. Pixar Another contributor to the films success is pervasive daring -- the daring of a pas de deux done in deep space by EVE who leaves pale blue traces of her force field behind her wherever she swoops and WALL-E whos propelled by a small fire extinguishers random squirts; of the integration in the most rigorous sense of beguiling show tunes from ""Hello Dolly""; of a sensationally funny parody involving the spaceships captain of the passage in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" when an ape first stands on his hind legs; of an exquisite moment when thanks to a security camera recording EVE comes to understand how diligently WALL-E had protected her while she was shut down. (""Like caring for a loved one whos in a coma"" a friend said after the screening.) Indeed how dare Andrew Stanton stop the whole enormous film in its tracks for a WALL-E-and-EVE version of the peerless scene in Chaplins ""City Lights"" when the once-blind flower girl slowly recognizes the tramp? But stop it he does and the scene takes your breath away. Who knew that you could be riveted by a robots dead eyes? Since the movie wasnt made by robots it isnt perfect. The narrative might have done with much less of WALL-E and EVE being chased by robots we dont care about through the sterile environs of the space ships innards. I found the use of Louis Armstrongs ""La Vie en Rose"" intrusive since theres no grounding for it in the story. And I was annoyed by the appearance on a spaceship video screen of Fred Willard as a frazzled captain of global industry urging the ships captain and crew to ""stay the course"" -- not so much because of the reference to contemporary politics though that seemed glib but because a familiar actors presence however brief impinges on the purity of the animation. That said the film stands as a stunning tour de force. The director has described it as his love letter to the golden era of sci-fi films that enchanted him as a kid in the 1970s. It is certainly that in hearts and spades. Beyond that though its a love letter to the possibilities of the movie medium and a dazzling demonstration of how computers can create a photorealistic world -- in this case a ruined world of mysterious majesty -- that leaves literal reality in the dust. Ill write more about this in Saturdays Weekend Journal but for now I must drop my inhibitions about dropping the M word -- especially since Ive already used magnificent -- and call ""WALL-E"" the masterpiece that it is. Wanted Before ""Wanted"" reaches the end of its wild course the violence thats been nothing but oppressive becomes genuinely if perversely impressive; the ritual carnage becomes balletic carnage (railroad cars included); the Walter Mitty-esque hero Wesley played by James McAvoy becomes a formidable enforcer of summary justice and Mr. McAvoy most memorably the young doctor in ""The Last King of Scotland"" becomes a certified star. So too does the Kazakhstan-born director Timur Bekmambetov whose 2004 fantasy thriller ""Night Watch"" and its 2006 sequel ""Day Watch"" had phenomenal success in the Russian market. He whips his action along mercilessly but with spectacular results. (Mitchell Amundsen was the director of photography.) The film based on the series of comic books by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones evokes a secret fraternity of assassins founded a thousand years ago by a clan of weavers. Why would weavers do such a thing? All I know is that secret messages are still contained in the warp and woof of textiles from a modern mill that Wesley visits. And that hes brought into the group because his severe anxiety attacks result from a superheated metabolism that bestows superpowers.

The fraternity includes Morgan Freeman -- he hasnt had such a meaty role in a long time -- and a less-than-fraternal Angelina Jolie who does lots of her patented imperturbable pouting but also figures gorgeously in several sensational action sequences. The story parses in moral terms even though it doesnt seem to for a very long time and the instruments of the mayhem include a garbage truckload of rats who engorged with peanut butter scurry forth beneath little time bombs strapped on their backs. Lets hope al Qaeda doesnt notice. ENLARGE DVD Tip The scuttling little droids in ""Silent Running"" (1972) -- actually dwarfs in android suits -- were progenitors of R2D2 not to mention WALL-E. This sci-fi fantasy was directed by the legendary Douglas Trumbull who supervised the special photographic effects in ""Blade Runner"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" Its also thematically related to ""WALL-E."" TV ListingsFind next listings for Douglas Trumbull on Locate TV. At a time when Earths vegetation has been destroyed by pollution and overcrowding a biologist played quite remarkably by Bruce Dern serves as a steward of precious forests that are flourishing aboard a giant spaceship. The film has become a cult classic and rightfully so but it was not a commercial success and Ive always thought the reason was that the script written by Deric Washburn Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco dashed the hopefulness that ""WALL-E"" so eloquently engenders.

Train travel in fact is a big part of the movie although Jolie and James McAvoy - Wanteds office-drone-turned-hero - prefer to ride the trains from on top. The views better up there even if you have to duck for tunnels. The English-language debut of Russian director Timur Bekmambetov whose Night Watch and Day Watch were likewise ricocheting and relentless Wanted is an assaultive roller coaster of a movie that would be more fun if the violence werent so nasty and if the script made any sense. Adapted from Mark Millar and J.G. Jones comic book series Wanted offers the classic fantasy of a loser dude - crummy job cheating gal low self-esteem - reborn as an action hero guns a-blazin and getting to lip-lock with the luscious-lipped Jolie. Shes Fox a vixen with ""Tears"" and ""Toil"" etched on her alarmingly thin biceps and shes part of a fraternity of assassins that have been killing people for 1000 years. Fox and her cohorts - headed by a nattily attired cliche-spouting Morgan Freeman - are descendants of a ""clan of weavers"" and while murder is their morally dubious pursuit theyve rationalized it. Their motto Kill one save a thousand. Theyre particular about whom they off and see themselves as active participants in the ""Loom of Fate."" Whatever. McAvoys Wesley Gibson gets pulled into this high-class assassination biz because it turns out his father was a member of the Order and Wes has inherited his dads supersensory skills. Wes thought he was suffering from panic attacks but actually when his pulse starts pounding at 400 beats per minute he can do things and see things with astounding precision clarity and power. So Wes tells his boss to go stuff her face with doughnuts kisses Fox in front of his cheating girlfriend and goes off to avenge his fathers death and kill a bunch of folks. Bekmambetov shoots the shootouts like gun porn - gleaming long-barreled weaponry shiny slo-mo projectiles etched with personalized messages for the victims. The films fetishization of firearms should win it the NRAs seal of approval. Maybe if the murder rate in Philadelphia wasnt so sickeningly high Wanteds senseless adoration of assault weapons wouldnt be so off-putting. McAvoy the game Scotsman of Atonement and The Last King of Scotland steps up for the ride - and for a couple of high velocity car chases - losing his Celtic burr and throwing his earnest all into the proceedings. He makes the movie almost likable. Jolie grins seductive grins strikes cool poses and parses her dopey dialogue with a devilish turn but Fox is no Lara Croft - Jolie these days is less sexy than she is scary on screen. Wanted is head-spinning stuff and its easy to get caught up in its masterfully manipulated mayhem. Visually and viscerally its pretty awesome. But when your head stops spinning and you start to think about it - well you realize that its not really worth thinking about much at all. Wanted 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. With James McAvoy Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. Distributed by Universal Pictures. Running time 1 hour 50 mins.

Also kind of nasty and brutish. And also undeniably kind of fun especially when Angelina Jolie as an assassin (assassiness? assassinix?) appropriately named Fox narrows her cat eyes sets her lush mouth flashes an Illiads worth of tattooed text on her impossible bod and brandishes firearms. But hold that thought a minute lets get back to unintelligible idiocy. See theres an overmedicated office drone named Wesley (Atonements James McAvoy) who hates his sucky life -- his girlfriend cheats on him his work supervisor is an outsize shrew. (Tsk Women) Then Fox shows up to tell Wesley hes destined to join a secret society of good-guy assassins who also happen to be weavers. I mean theyre a guild of killers who can read the names of future evildoers woven into encoded cloth by a magical Loom of Fate. Then as Loom monitor Morgan Freeman explains it its up to the assassins to ""kill one and maybe save a thousand."" I mean -- oh screw it its a comic book from the series by Mark Millar and JG Jones. Anyhow the Scottish-born McAvoy proves to be as nimble a befuddled hero as he is an unlikely choice for the gig. The nasty and brutish component meanwhile arrives courtesy of director Timur Bekmambetov; hes the crazy Kazakh action stylist who made the 2004 international thriller Night Watch and the equally mad 2006 follow-up Day Watch. Wanted is set in America -- Wesley is ostensibly a cog out of a Dilbert comic strip -- but theres global realpolitik glee to the filmmakers fancy-splatter approach to violence. There are also a lot of exploding rats. And best of all theres a lot of Jolie barrels blazing. The stars fearlessly sexy hauteur is unique in the biz today. And when she works it in Wanted she kills bullets optional.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint What male cubicle slave hasnt wished he could escape into a life of thrills and intrigue? In ""Wanted"" James McAvoy plays ""doormat to the world"" Wesley Gibson a lowly cuckolded accountant who Googles himself and finds a humiliating blank page. His bank account is so depleted that the ATM machine heckles him. His apartment is close enough to the train tracks that he can read the commuters newspapers. When a lithe gunslinger named Fox (Angelina Jolie) pulls him into a life of roaring car chases frenzied gun battles and a secret assassination society (headed by Morgan Freeman) Wesley learns that daydreams can leave ugly scars. ""Wanted"" is an ultrastylish ultraviolent take on the standard summertime action film from Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (""Night Watch"" ""Day Watch""). He doesnt obsess over fine points of characterization hiring overqualified actors to play stick figures and then punching the film into overdrive. Hes all about the carnage and ""Wanted"" leaves the theater floor slick with blood and broken glass. Its one of the most empty-headed but visually impressive films Ive seen in years. Sloan Freemans character informs Wesley that the young mans father was a legendary assassin for a killing cult formed 1000 years ago by a society of weavers. You sense that this decision like most of those shaping the movie was made because Bekmambetov thought he could make it look cool. So Sloan and Wesley stand beside massive looms that churn out coded directives about who must be eliminated to protect the social order. One of the oddball joys of the film is seeing art-house heartthrob McAvoy (""Atonement"" ""The Last King of Scotland"") learn the mystic battle arts of his new profession as he trains with blades guns and fists. Seeing him do a full-on heroic slide across the hood of a speeding car is like watching Colin Firth pop and lock. Which is not to say he does it poorly. McAvoy makes his worm-turned-warrior a sympathetic guy even when hes sending a bullet through someones temple in hyper-slow agony-vision. He even informs some crazy scenes with genuine emotion. Hanging from a train car teetering over a bottomless gorge he has a flicker of indecision about whether to kill the enemy whos pulling him to safety. Its a weirdly affecting moment in a sequence of laughably lunatic destruction. Jolie repeats tricks she perfected in ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" and Freeman proves he can bring gravitas to the flimsiest of roles. WANTED  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong bloody violence throughout pervasive language and some sexuality. Working a niche somewhere between the black comedy of ""Fight Club"" and the ultrafashionable mayhem of ""The Matrix"" ""Wanted"" is an experience thats hard to defend as a whole but mesmerizing in a highway-accident rubbernecking kind of way.

"Wanted weaves an intriguing if far-fetched plot - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Wanted weaves an intriguing if far-fetched plot Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Jaap Buitendijk Universal Studios In the killing business Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman are cut from the same cloth. Theyre weavers by day when theyre not assassinating people. SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE HEADLINES FROM PEOPLE.COM By Claudia Puig USA TODAY It would be understandable to be leery of an action thriller that opens portentously with the words ""A thousand years ago ..."" and then goes on to tell of an ancient ""clan of weavers"" who formed a murderous fraternity. But this kind of inadvertent humor is combined with an intentionally snarky attitude and dark comedy to make Wanted (  1/2 out of four) more enjoyable than it ought to be. CLIPCatch a preview of Wanted CALENDAR Plot out your summer movie plans Much of the entertainment value comes from jaw-dropping stunts and explosive action sequences which are high-octane fun. Yes bullets bend blood spews cars crash and bodies are punched stabbed and shot up. But the look of the film as directed by Russian-born filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov (Day Watch) is highly inventive even though the plot is inane and some of the dialogue is decidedly awkward or cliched. Wanted like the Matrix movies has a stylized visual panache. Bullets from different directions move in slow motion and clash in midair and a gunman leaps through a mirrored glass window shattering it into brilliant shards while shooting relentlessly suspended between building roofs. Angelina Jolie is a sultry sight to behold effortlessly pulling off outlandish and extreme maneuvers. In the scenic countryside of the Czech Republic she jumps a boxy car into a moving train where it lodges itself in one of the cabins atop the seats. She also pulls a variation of an Evel Knievel stunt and catapults the sports car shes driving over several police cruisers and a bus firing off rounds at her target all the while. The focus of the plot is on twentysomething accounting manager Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy who projects an engaging anti-hero quality). He spends most of his day in an office cubicle quaking in fear of his obnoxious boss and popping pills to ease his panic attacks. Although he is aware that his sleazy girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend Wesley is such an emotional slacker that he doesnt bother to confront them. But after being recruited by the weaver clan/assassination club suddenly he finds he has the right stuff to shoot the wings off a fly. Jolie and Morgan Freeman are key members of this weaving clan toiling in a cloistered Chicago textile factory that looks like a Gothic castle. Sure their real trade is cloth but they dabble in the killing business as well carrying out the assignments designated by ""Fate."" Freeman sermonizes about the Loom of Fate another of those chortle-inducing features. Apparently when looked at under a microscope weavings contain critical missed stitches that create a binary code spelling out the name of assassination targets. How refreshingly low-tech. Wanted is silly and far-fetched. And if it didnt back up its ridiculous plot with spellbinding visceral energy it would have been a dismal failure. But the thrilling stunts and hyperkinetic action scenes are the undisputed stars of this surprisingly entertaining film. (Rating R for strong bloody violence throughout pervasive language and some sexuality. Running time 1 hour 50 minutes. Opens tonight in select theaters and Friday nationwide.)

James McAvoy is a nervy stifled office lackey who is one day asked to join a secret fraternity of assassins by a heavily tattooed Angelina Jolie. Why? Because he possesses the innate ability to curve bullets with his mind of course. Based in the back room of a textile factory the team receive orders to kill via the coded weavings of a magical loom. So far-fetched is all this (the threat of an army of exploding rats has already been made) that when overseer Morgan Freeman delivers the line We call this... the Loom of Fate you wont bat an eyelid. Its already the lingua franca.This is cinema for people who slow down at car wrecks Bekmambetov takes pleasure in showing us a bullet slowly boring in or out of the cranium while taking great care in sculpting the resultant swirl of CG blood. McAvoy is reasonable in his first action lead but offers a tin-eared approximation of the US accent that comes across less like the middle-class salaryman he is and more Jewish New York cab driver (think Bob Hoskins). Theres an eccentric otherness to the film which just manages to sustain the interest but whether Bekmambetovs talents lie in filmmaking rather than gaming or comics is debatable.

But yes he should have some some care for them and those in the many car chases who must have died... I loved this film. I expected to find it foolish having heard its premises were so and therefor not enjoy it. Perhaps thats why I didnt mind some aspects of the plot. But I think it was more than that cos I really like it. The loom was stupid but so are a great deal of fictional and superhero film premises. McAvoy was inspired casting; with his intensity and reality that give conviction to all the characters Ive seen him play previously. Dont know who else they were considering but many other people would have left the film floundering. James makes me believe a lot of the unbelievable stuff here. Or at the very least makes me enjoy it. I think its not much like the comics - fans of the comics arent impressed. But something too close to them I dont think would have worked as a movie. Different mediums and all that. As for not liking the casting I can understand that since Fox in the comics is basically Halle Berry and Wes is Ememem. However I dont think they would have worked in this translation to film There have been reviews saying females are unkindly presented. Id agree though I hadnt thought of it before and it didnt affect my enjoyment of the movie. I still love the boss - shes great. The girlfriend could have been given more depth and understanding. Living with someone as disconnected as James character would be hard. Not suggesting she was right in how she dealt with it just saying the character wasnt given enough depth. Angelina despite her limited number of lines familiar pout and being there largely as eye-candy played the part well somehow seemed to have depth and didnt leave me requiring anything more. It was a bit self involved - especially with James commentary. I was cringing a bit for the last one... but then the last line of the movie made me laugh. Its such a big question coming out of a film without any real philosophical depth. Maybe it meant to have that depth but I found any philosophical stuff in it dismissable as plot construction so the last line just reminded me I was taking the movie as an enjoyable tongue-in-cheek action movie. Id also like to note the fantastic music that lent a huge amount to the action-romp tone of the whole thing. In the end despite any holes in the strange plot I enjoyed it as a fictional action romp with brilliant actors adding the necessary depthFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 11 2009kermyFeaturedI had a long and painful relationship once. which i would gladly endure again before ever having to see this film once more. proof that we humans have disappointed ourselves with the poor use of our potential.  what a god awful load of s%^t. very much up there with the worst films i have ever seenFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 10 2009nickFeaturedwhat an aboslute shocking film  i cant be botherd writing much so to some it up  ide rather rip my dk off and put it in my mouth than watch that film ever againFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 4 2009ZOFHFeaturedA Top Class Action Fantasy.

Its not the word I would use except if it was prededed by another two and they are lack of. This was a Mac-Movie. Instantly forgotten except for the sour aftertaste of WTF was that about?. With more holes than an Emmenthal cheese the plot produces yet another megalomaniac who wants to mould the world to his tastes using a loom to spell out his targets in code - the already mentioned Loom of Fate. I felt it was more like if you wish a Loom with a View - and the view is death to all the bosss opponents. I can hardly believe that I wasted an afternoon watching this drivel but then again Im not a lobotomised bean sprout although this movie did its best to turn me into oneFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 31 2008Barbara VFeaturedI was looking forward to seeing this movie Wanted tonight. I enjoyed Mr. amp;Mrs. Smith with Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt but I was so disgusted and disappointed in this film. There was way too much violence and scenes with large rats as big as cats so gross. I would think Ms Jolie who is the Mother of so many children would want to give a better impression of herself to the public. This is a movie that doesnt send the right vibes to the younger generation. It was pure trash.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 9 2008goanFeaturedthis rocks FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 28 2008CrawmerFeaturedLooks flash but no logic whatsoever.

Er hello? What have you done lately? he says later. Well I havent murdered 300 people mate... pretty proud of that. Worst plot-hole ever. And worst mention of a loom in a movie ever.

This turkey knocks off Vanilla Sky as my worst ever film. Truly you should recommend it as FANTASTIC to someone you really dont like - itll be 110 interminable minutes of their life theyll never get back. Utterly awful. Id give it a negative rating if it was at all possible.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 19 2008Henry ZakumumpaFeaturedIf you want a thoughtful film with depth WANTED is not your cup of tea. But it is a real joy to watch. In many ways its a feel-good movie at least it feels that way when you leave your seat at the cinema. All you have to do is to let your brain into recess and turn on the imagination burton. Its very akin to the Clive Owen film Shoot Em. The story is really a simple one. The James McAvoy character is a low-grade accountant with a small office cubicle at a mediocre accounting firm with a boss from hell.Our main characters girlfriend is sleeping with his best friend. He has an all round lack of application . He rents a lowly apartment near a noisy railway line and he is the butt of jokes at the work place. Unknown to him is the fact that he is the father of a hitman from a company called the fraternity. He is approached and told that his father has been killed on the job and that he has rare talents for being a hitman.He is then trained to become a hitman with the ultimate aim of having him avenge his fathers death. The training is atrocious includes being able to bend a bullet to hit your target running on top of high speed trains. There are twists and turn from that moment on including a suprise realisation abefore the close of the film . If you want action bullets Matrix-type air-borne shooting sprees fantasy fightsthis is your kind of movie. The movie doesnt pretend to be what its not you just figure that your are in for a fun time at the cinema. On a deeper level WANTED is about personal redemption. Violence here is some kind of therapy. The lead character overcomes his demons and mediocre life and begins to see himself in new ligh with his new found power and application. On another level WANTED is a satire about living a frustrating middle class existence. Do you have the guts to turn around your life and kick ass? The very last line of the movie is what have you done lately? Angelina jolie lends her screen presence to this one and only plays a limited role in WANTEDbut its at critical points in the film. This film will not tax your brains but it invites you to suspend your brains for a while and release your imagination. If you can do that for about 120 minutes then its a guarenteed fun time at the cineplex.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 19 2008Henry ZakumumpaFeaturedIf you want a thoughtful film with depth WANTED is not your cup of tea.

The plot was awful - how could anyone avoid laughing this idea out of court when the script was sent in with a plot based on a 1000yr old magic loom. And did James McAvoy need to be punched and kniefed as part of his training - and if there was a reason why in such a graphic way? Its a shame that the use of stylised violence when needed which other directors use with thought and the great CGI could not be more thoughtfully woven together to make a good film.. andFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 13 2008LouiseFeaturedOn so many levels this is an appalling film. It was shocking to see so much totally pointless violence. In the current climate of youth gang-related violence what sort of message it is to say quit your boring day job and become an assassin to find fullfillment and work out who you truly are. The misogyny also does not go unoticed. What were the actors thinking? Im no movie star but surely money isnt everything especially to people who one assumes already have plenty. Angelina Jolie presents herself as an earth mother type and to be in something like this it difficult to comprehend. James McAvoy surely this the sort of trash that an actor would perhaps be in at the twilight of their career as a straight- to-video release (Morgan Freeman? Terence Stamp?) but surely not someone so clearly in vogue. The plot was also threadbare in the extreme (pun intended). And why blow up rats? Nasty cruely to animals again beyond entertainment. It saddens me that anyone could enjoy this film it has no merit at all. Please do not waste your money. The lowest rating I can give here is 1 star but giving it any is uncomfortable. This film should be banned.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 12 2008MILESFeatureda great movie with a code of honour and a great commentary on control in modern day corprate mess with the loom of fate as a great metaphor for todays chaotic world  jolie was great and i am surprised how some silly critics can criticise her for having skinny arms do super beings have to be muscle hunks even when they are as sexy as AJ ALSO FOR THE MAIN REVIEWER people who slow down for car wrecks do so for 1.the traffic police has turned 3 lanes to a single lane . 2we are human and curious about fellow humanity. 3.we do like to say a prayer for the safety of the poor victims involved in the wreck .

""Is this when we start to bond?"" asks McAvoy. ""Would you like to?"" Jolie purrs. Then theres a shot of the two smooching. The thing is that first rooftop scene isnt even in the movie and the kiss (which is) has nothing to do with romance. There is no love story. At all.So much for truth in advertising. The rest of the trailer however gives you a fair taste of Russian director Timur Bekmambetovs hyperbolically violent movie. The filmmaker whose Russian sci-fi fantasies ""Day Watch"" and ""Night Watch"" broke box-office records in his homeland whips this preposterous tale of an ancient secret society of assassins into an expressionistic frenzy relishing every slo-mo bullet through the skull. McAvoy is an anxious cuckolded office drone whos recruited by the Fraternity and transformed into the superhuman super assassin he was born to be it turns out his murdered father was this nutty organizations greatest killer. Its sagacious leader (Morgan Freeman natch) explains that they are just restoring order to a chaotic world. ""Trust your instincts"" he advises which should give you an inkling of the scripts originality.Jolie radiating slinky lethal glamour is one of the more accomplished death-dispensers though when she punches out McAvoy (during his training) you fear her needle-thin arms will crack on the spot. Somebody needs to give this beautiful assassin a Fatburger. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ""Wanted"" has one good plot twist in store (though it makes little sense) and its sense of humor about its own silliness keeps the fantasy afloat for a while. But as the body count rises so does the portentous tone and the relentlessness of Bekmambetovs overamped style becomes oppressive. The astonishingly versatile McAvoy does more than keep a straight face; he works his butt off to anchor the tale in real emotions and almost pulls it off. Heres a movie that offers mass murder as a cure for the 9-to-5 blues. Is that Russian or what?

By Anthony Lane Angelina Jolie as Fox a member of an ancient order of assassins.   Credit JOHN RITTER What is it like being Timur Bekmambetov? No artist should be confused too closely with his creations but anybody who sits through ""Wanted"" Bekmambetovs new movie will be tempted to wonder if the life style of the characters might not reflect or rub off on that of the director. How for example does he make a cup of coffee? My best guess based on the evidence of the film is that he tosses a handful of beans toward the ceiling shoots them individually into a fine powder leaves it hanging in the air runs downstairs breaks open a fire hydrant with his head carefully directs the jet of water through the window of his apartment sets fire to the building then stands patiently with his mug amid the blazing ruins to collect the precious percolated drops. Dont even think about a cappuccino. The great thing about Bekmambetov is that even the mildest of devices spur him into helpless exaggeration. ""Wanted"" begins with a flashback but not for him the gentle glance over the past month or the childhood cameo; instead up comes the dauntless title ""1000 years ago."" One day presumably a wet Thursday a secret society of medieval weavers suddenly decided to create an even more secret society of global assassins. This was done apparently to maintain ""the balance of the world"" a principle reiterated later in the film but the episode leaves you panting to know more. Why weavers? Why not potters or pastry cooks? Until now I never made the connection between haberdashery and homicide but ""Wanted"" is determined to prove the link and viewers will certainly think twice before joining their local knitting circle. Mind you we never discover who orders the kills it could be governments businessmen or bishops. Is the whole film no more than totalitarian housecleaning posing as democratic do-gooding and if so who will screen it for Vladimir Putin? We now leap a thousand years to Chicago or at any rate to an outsiders overheated fabrication of the city. Bekmambetov was born in the Soviet Union and this is his first film set in the United States but ""Wanted"" never feels solidly American and not just because James McAvoy keeps slipping into his native Scottish. He plays Wesley Gibson who loathes his existence. Given that it involves both accountancy and cuckoldry he may have a point and the twitchy Gibson is the heir of a hundred other movie mice headed by Jack Lemmon in ""The Apartment."" Bekmambetov however is simply unable or unwilling to let such quiet desperation sink in. Instead he pumps up the sound (the click of a stapler resounds like a rivet gun) and stuffs his camera into peoples faces for the sake of a bulging closeup. This is the filmmaking equivalent of prodding someone in the chest with a forefinger as youre telling a joke and it means that the tone remains the same at yelping level when Gibsons life is changed. A pity because its quite a shift; one moment hes waiting alone in a grocery store and the next Angelina Jolie is standing by his side. End of mousehood. Ms. Jolie is I am pleased to report in splendid form. Watch her as she runs along the top of a speeding train and approaching a tunnel lies back like a sunbather and lets the roof of it swoosh over her basking in the satisfaction of a near-miss and by extension in the worlds unflagging worship of her cool. ""Get away from me"" McAvoy shouts to her at one point and she gives an ineffable smile charmed by the absurdity of the request. You dont tell Angelina Jolie to go away; she tells you. In ""Wanted"" she plays Fox one of the fraternity of killers who informs Gibson that his father was the doyen of the group that he was wiped out only the day before by a rogue operator and that he weedy Wesley must learn the ropes and avenge this foul unnatural crime. Hamlet was under the same obligation but lacking access to high-powered rifles and exploding rats he took longer to finish the job. Gibson is introduced to the chief assassin Sloan (Morgan Freeman) who teaches him how to bend a bullet in mid-flight. ""Let your instincts guide you"" he advises having clearly enjoyed his time at the Obi-Wan Kenobi School of Karmic Weaponhood. To achieve a satisfactory bend you have to whip the pistol round like a discus thrower a skill soon perfected by our hero. As nonsense goes this has a certain gusto and glee and what dismayed me was that Bekmambetov felt the need to spice it with the addition of coarsely chopped violence. What looks set to be a boyish pop-eyed fantasy--if Angelina Jolie kicks out your windshield and asks you to take the wheel while she sprawls on your hood and shoots at the vehicle behind you can hardly refuse--warps into a welter of bloodletting. The knife work is especially cruel and it puts parents into a quandary their teen-age kids are the ideal (probably the sole) consumers of this loud silly dream about a furtive brotherhood but they are also precisely the wrong people to be told that stabbing is a talent to be envied and worse still that its effects wear off in a nice hot bath. As foreheads burst asunder and as Gibson caps the mayhem by firing repeatedly through the back of a dead mans head I wanted to ask Is this the true legacy of ""Pulp Fiction""--that the fiction would lose all credibility and make way for actual human pulp? Halfway through ""The Happening""as the movie began to splutter I realized what M. Night Shyamalan needs more than anything else. He needs Val Lewton. To anyone toiling in genre movies during the Second World War Lewton was a godsend a fixer a fabled storyteller and the kind of guy who gives producers a good name and stops directors from getting a bad one. Born in Yalta he wound up as the head of horror--now theres one for the resume--at R.K.O. in 1942 where he produced films such as ""The Ghost Ship"" ""The Body Snatcher"" ""Cat People"" and the unambiguously titled ""I Walked with a Zombie."" The last two were directed by the energetic Jacques Tourneur but even with lesser talents Lewton proved himself the nonpareil of atmosphere and zip. Too much of the first as he saw and the tale clogs up; too much of the second and you leave the horror behind. If Shyamalans need for such guidance seems more urgent than ever it may be because ""The Happening"" is an eco-drama and that I regret to say is a contradiction in terms. Environmental catastrophe is a clear and present danger but if youre a head-scratching screenwriter its not a patch on the Red Menace. To be fair for the first twenty minutes Shyamalan finds a regular rhythm of shock people in Central Park and then in the surrounding blocks start to halt in their tracks like robots on strike and take their own lives with whatever comes to hand--a firearm a high building a prong being used as a hair clip. As the story spreads and the action moves from New York to Philadelphia from town to countryside and from crowd to gaggle we slowly realize that greenery has gone toxic trees grass and plants are wafting death into our brains. The response to Shyamalans film has been almost shrublike in its venom and there is no denying that his ear for dialogue appears to be overgrown with moss. The performances too are weirdly stunted normally reliable actors like Mark Wahlberg John Leguizamo and Zooey Deschanel--playing respectively a science teacher a math teacher and a worried wife all fleeing the leafy threat--stalk through the action with a mixture of grimaces goofiness and what I charitably read as indigestion rather than catatonia. To be honest I would be perfectly happy to walk with a zombie after ninety minutes of this; it would feel like light relief. Nevertheless movies every bit as stumbling as ""The Happening"" and far more savage come out every month and few are greeted with such contempt. Why should this be? My suspicion is that Shyamalan despite everything still gets under peoples skin and that their mockery is a way of saying it aint so. He is plainly obsessive--that is not just the source of his appeal but the prelude to his follies--and we are made uneasy and embarrassed by obsession. (The same problem arises in Michael Powell films.) I have always taken Shyamalan to be a fearmonger but the new film suggests that he may be at heart a morbidologist he is trying to reinsert the fear of death into a moviegoing culture that would prefer to think of it as laughable dismissible or gross. People around me in the cinema were cackling at some of the suicides in ""The Happening"" but self-annihilation and the host of motives that can spur us toward it is no joke. Those who punish a filmmaker for the crime of humorlessness are the same audiences who go tense and quiet on the rare occasions when as Shyamalan did in ""The Sixth Sense"" he makes sombre and controlled use of the same anxieties. ""The Happening"" is an awful letdown yet it leaves you with something new as a gently waving tree--that classical image of pastoral tranquillity--mutates into a harbinger of doom. Its the first time Ive seen that and I guess it wont be the last.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Angie Get Your Guns Jolie kills Carell smarts Hunter Thompson blasts from the past. _ By David Edelstein Published Jun 23 2008 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Universal Pictures) Along with every other hyperbolic critical adjective state-of-the-art has been devalued by overuse so lets move the boundary posts and proclaim Wanted state-of-the-art state-of-the-art. Assassins propel themselves through space distend time bend bullets like Beckham and live both dangerously and parabolically Yoweeee What a ride on the cyber-whoosh rapids It takes about an hour after its over for the heart to slow the brain to recalibrate and the nonsensicalness of the thing to sink in I fell for that??? By then youll have already babbled to a few dozen friends and strangers You gotta see this movie Its like the bighearted urge to share your Ecstasy at a party. The premise itself isnt world-shattering Wanted is the standard summer-thriller mishmash of blockbusters past from The Matrix (obviously) to The Terminator to Star Wars to Harry Potter with a bit of Bourne for ballast. All feature protagonists who suddenly discover their specialness (Your long-awaited destiny  etc.) along with latent powers they must learn to control (Let your instincts guide you  etc.) a journey that becomes a metaphor for growing up achieving autonomy etc. Skinny Scottish darling James McAvoy puts on an American accent for his first Hollywood FX blockbuster as Wesley Gibson a timid accountant (Im an accountant) who gobbles fistfuls of anti-anxiety pills to counter palpitations (flub-dub flub-dub) and peculiar wobbles in the space-time continuum. Refilling a prescription he finds his jitters are about to increase exponentially There beside him stands Angelina Jolie who utters the pictures equivalent of Come with me if you want to liveonly with a twinkle of amusement as if the whole gazillion-dollar movie were her little toy. BACKSTORY In Wanted Angelina Jolies dexterous assassina member of a brother- (and sister-) hood of killersis tattooed from neck to ankle. Jolies body art is well documented but its not easy to tell which belong to her and which to her character. We added a bunch she admitted to MTV. But based on mine. On the idea that fraternity is based on a sense of justice. As you may know Jolies baby daddy Brad Pitt also got a new much-remarked-upon tat based on a doodle by Angelina. Sweet. The first act of Wanted might be subtitled Waiting for Angelina. Shes neither the hero nor the villain (its a supporting role) but her aura is essential Amid all the artificiality shes a natural wonder with novel permutations of nature-nurture nuttiness. Offscreen we know her as both an occasional home-wrecker and a fervently articulate do-goodera tantalizing mix. Onscreen her aura reshapes every scene. Laugh all you like but shed be a great Hedda Gabler. Can she project vulnerability? Yesshe had a moment believe it or not in the Lara Croft sequel before blowing away her true love. But shell never be a crying-on-the-inside kind of gal. Shes too well defended. In Wanted she plays Fox (just Fox) the distaff member of an ancient fraternity of assassins presided over by Morgan Freeman. She whisks Wesley out of apparent harms way by firing bullets that seem like extensions of her will then steers a car with her long legs while directing a fusillade at the terminator on their taila rogue assassin (Thomas Kretschmann) now picking off old colleagues. When fraternity members train Wesley rather brutally in the art of harnessing his powers Jolie sits back has a little snack and meets the pummeled accountants eyes when the mood strikes her. Could any other actress convey so much while emoting so little? Jolie is a happy distraction from a lot of twaddle (the movie is based on a comic-book series) about mystical coded messages that show up in a giant loom and appear to be hits ordered by Godwho youd think could take out people on His own with the occasional bolt of lightning. But the deft script (by Michael Brandt Derek Haas and Chris Morgan) ends up inverting many of the Matrix tropes it appropriates. (The denouement is a triumph of rug pulling.) And Timur Bekmambetov the Kazakhstan-born director who made the head-trippy vampire opus Night Watch is a killer when it comes to mixing fast and slow motion in ways that screw up your biorhythms You feel as if youre riding on the back of those curving bullets as they hit their targets with a satisfying splat. Wanted has the kind of irresistible summer-movie allure that makes studio executives drool in anticipation. Even its title must swim before their eyes and transform into Want-to-See. Get Smart is likable and very funnyat least a two-to-one ratio of excellent gags to clunkersbut its not for better or worse Get Smart. In spite of the ridiculous malfunctioning secret-agent gadgets the sixties Mel BrooksBuck Henry sitcom wasnt so much a James Bond parody as an American espionage reworking of Peter Sellerss Inspector Clouseau. Agent Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) might have fancied himself 007 but he was a preening boob without a trace of self-awarenesswhich ironically ensured his triumph over his rational (and therefore easily flummoxed) foes. Peter Segals star-packed update is bursting with uproarious gadget shtick but Steve Carells Max simply isnt the idiot we knew and loved. On his own terms Carell is delightful. But hes delightful as a mild-mannered know-it-all whose occasional flights of grandiosity cant keep him from plummeting to Earth. Hes plucky but not impervious. Hes the hero of the deskbound techie nerds at headquarters the geek who gets to move from his analyst job into the field and prove he has the wherewithal to think on his feet. (Theres a genius bit at a urinal.) Its a valid question whether wed want another obtuse Don Adamslike Agent 86. Get Smart the sitcom was a one-joke affair and got tedious fast whereas Carells starry-eyed dweeb has room for nuance for growth for inspiration. A case can be made for both Maxes. Me I miss the thickie. 1 2 Next Share this story...

""Wanted"" devilishly ups the ante to a new level in adapting violent comics to the bigscreen. By confidently grafting nastily creative high-tech new ways to kill people onto traditional dramatic themes involving professional assassins and family revenge Kazakhstan-born Timur Bekmambetov assures himself the distinction of becoming the first modern director to emerge from Russia to carve a high profile in Hollywood. Relentless in-your-face action and a classy cast led by a beefed-up James McAvoy and a heavily tatted Angelina Jolie combine to promise powerful B.O. prospects worldwide for Universal. As the man responsible for the two highest-grossing films in Russian history ""Night Watch"" and its sequel ""Day Watch"" Bekmambetov a helmer with muscular visual skills akin to those of top commercials directors was a good bet to supply the desired edge and a distinctive flavor to this type of genre fare. Often fruitfully and sometimes gratuitously he gooses every shot with some extra jolt or manipulation be it an abrupt change in camera speed skip-framing odd pulsation or just good old-fashioned rack focus. He can even use the leading characters accelerated metabolism as a plausible excuse to create a visual correlative in the films often breathless rhythms. Like it or not ""Wanted"" pretty much slams you to the back of your chair from the outset and scarcely lets up for the duration. Opening action sequence provides a pretty good indication of whats in store in this adaptation of the popular cult comics created by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones After deftly avoiding assassination in his office in a Chicago skyscraper the formidable-looking Mr. X (David Patrick OHara) leaps through glass and across the void to the roof of the building across the way only to finally lose a gun battle fought with bullets that follow curved trajectories when fired by shooters who know what theyre doing. Next day put-upon account manager Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is abruptly informed by a mysterious woman (Jolie) standing in a supermarket line that his father one of the all-time great assassins died yesterday. Suddenly this woman whose name aptly happens to be Fox is in a firefight with Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) the man who killed dear old dad -- a duel that continues in insanely speeding vehicles on the Chitown streets. Thats two hyperventilated action sequences in the first 25 minutes. Fox takes Wesley to the fortress-like headquarters of the Fraternity where a nattily attired Morgan Freeman as the orgs boss Sloan explains how the 1000-year-old institution takes it upon itself to eliminate people who are fated to die for reasons dictated by hidden patterns in textiles woven at the factory. Learning that this is as good a reason as any to bump off people he doesnt know Wesley undergoes training -- repeatedly getting the living crap beaten out of him by menacing guys with names like the Repairman the Butcher and the Exterminator -- in brutally sadistic interludes designed to make the wimpy loser tough enough to take on the rogue former Fraternity brother Cross. Once hes graduated by perfecting the art of the bending bullet Wesley achieves his rite of passage to ultimate manhood -- defined as being able to kill without hesitation or remorse. Wesleys transformation from one-time pushover to indestructible powerhouse is not unlike that of any number of Marvel heroesalthough the context and implications here are much darker than in the worlds of Spider-Man and his brethren. Desperate to go toe-to-toe with Cross Wesley heads to Europe and the birthplace of the Fraternity where under duress its monkish leader (Terence Stamp) arranges a rendezvous aboard a train. This spectacularly outlandish action sequence which parallels multiple earlier scenes of Wesley and Fox training on top of Chicagos El would seem designed to cap things off. But as concocted by scripters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas (who collaborated on ""310 to Yuma"" and ""2 Fast 2 Furious"") and Chris Morgan (""The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift"") there are multiple betrayals avenged misdeeds and literal mind-blowing still to come in a film that never lets up. The diminutive McAvoy might have seemed an unexpected choice for this sort of kickass role but the always inventive thesp proves hes got a bit of Russell Crowe in him as he brandishes an impressive amount of muscle grit and anger. He may be one of those rare actors who can do just about anything. Fox is a perfect role for Jolie a sort of fancified extension of her Mrs. Smith that allows her to be a tough babe and also gently send up the caricature. While intoning the dialogue with his usual elan Freeman gets to be nastier than usual as the big boss in charge of all the secrets. Most of the supporting thesps register strongly on the basis of being memorable physical types. Bekmambetovs Russian films showed he knows how to achieve the visceral effects he wants and the vastly greater means at his disposal here provide him with the tools to supercharge his work; he will have his pick of projects now. He and his highly pro team of lenser Mitchell Amundsen production designer John Myhre editor David Brenner and myriad hands in the effects makeup stunt location and other departments manage a consistent blend of live-action with computer effects and Prague studio work with Chicago and New York street shooting. As if the picture needed it Danny Elfmans score provides additional propulsion.
