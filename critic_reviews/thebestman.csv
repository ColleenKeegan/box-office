"Best Man Rolling Down the Aisle Print Edition Style Articles Weekend Section Front Page Articles On Our Site Movies amp; Videos Whats Playing Recommended Films New This Week Video Finder Style Live Best Man Rolling Down the Aisle By Teresa Wiltz Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 22 1999; Page C01 In the great relationship game--and if you dont think its a game you probably came out the womb hitched--there are men who commit. Men who dont commit wont commit. Ever. And then there are the men who cant commit serial monogamists who stand frozen at the abyss unable to jump in--and unable to walk away. In ""The Best Man"" there are celluloid representatives from each category straight out of one of those ubiquitous ""Men Are From . . ."" books Theres Lance (Morris Chestnut) a Bible-thumping panty-hunting football player whos decided that marriage is the sure-fire ""cure for promiscuity."" Or at least thats what he hopes. Theres Quentin (Terrence Dashon Howard) who never met a woman he didnt want to bed. And of course theres Harper (Taye Diggs) Lances best man who prides himself on the fact that hes managed to survive two years in a ""drama-free"" relationship but gets all squirmy whenever his long-suffering girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan) mentions the L-word. Theyre all buddies from their college days gathered together to celebrate the impending nuptials of Lance and his too-good-to-be-true bride Mia (Monica Calhoun). So what if Harpers new novel promises to toss some serious skeletons out of their designer-filled closets? Whats a little drama among friends? Such is the premise of writer-director Malcolm Lees ""The Best Man"" the latest entrant in the beautiful buppie school of filmmaking (preceded by ""Love Jones"" ""Hav Plenty"" and ""How to Be a Player"") where the men are all buff and the women are all fine. Everyone is an outrageous success from Harpers impending bestseller thats already been anointed by Oprah to Lances phat NFL contract to Jordans glamorous TV producer gig. Still notwithstanding the flush trappings this is a film about feelings particularly those of men as they grapple with the Big Issues Will marriage permanently scratch that itch? Is there such a thing as an Ideal Woman? Is the one that got away always The One? What about the Madonna/Whore thing? Is true fidelity possible? And just what constitutes loyalty in friendship? And because this is a film about men the women play on the sidelines. They are either altar-bound wannabe altar-bound or too obsessed with career to realize that they should be altar-bound. Nia Long plays Jordan the ""best girlfriend Harper never had."" Shes a producer at BET (miraculously relocated from Washington to Manhattan) and in the hands of Lee (whos Spike Lees cousin) shes yet another depiction of an ambitious career woman who cant get a man never mind that shes sexy beautiful and smart. ""Jordans too damn sassy and independent"" Lance tells Harper. ""A woman like that dont need no man. Shes just one step from lesbian."" Lines like that practically beg ""Best Man"" to dig deeper to excavate the contradictions between what men often say they want and what they really want. But ""Best Man"" starts smart and finishes dumb. It skitters between soap opera and slapstick never settling on a happy medium. Too much time is devoted to the twists and turns of the contrived plot line--namely whether Harpers way-too-autobiographical novel will derail the wedding. Despite the scripts weaknesses however the actors serve up strong performances. Audiences will no doubt take to the engaging Diggs who sent hearts a-fluttering with his debut performance in ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" while Long gives a nuanced reading of an underwritten part. A particular standout is the droll Howard who plays the womanizing player of the group--or at least the one who is the most in touch with his inner dog. Beneath Quentins bravado are glimpses of a wounded heart albeit one in deep denial ""My mother not being around dont have [expletive] to do with how I be treating these [women]."" Its been dubbed the black ""Big Chill"" but to do so does a disservice to the film as if the filmmakers are unable to come up with a single original thought beyond mimicking the creations of white filmmakers whove gone before them. Thats too bad. There are precious few images of African American love playing at the local cineplex let alone characters who want to make it to the church on time. To that end Lees film fills a void lighting up the screen with a big chocolate kiss. But ultimately when its all said and done ""Best Man"" remains always a groomsman never a groom It backs down on its promise to both challenge and entertain opting instead for the easy laugh--and the pat ending. The Best Man (115 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity adult situations and semi-nudity.

Comments The Best Man In this romantic comedy a wedding reunites childhood friends--all in the service of examining gender roles and heterosexual commitment. Viewers who mistake the didacticism for stylistic weakness miss much of the point of this nicely toned movie in which a novelist whos worried that his girlfriend is getting too serious looks forward to standing up at the ceremony--he has some unfinished business with one of the bridesmaids. But the weekend takes a potentially disastrous turn when the other members of the wedding party get an advance copy of his latest book whose characters are closely based on them. Written and directed by Malcolm Lee; with Taye Diggs Nia Long Morris Chestnut Harold Perrineau Terrence Howard Sanaa Lathan Monica Calhoun and Melissa De Sousa.

Starring Taye Diggs Nia Long Morris Chestnut Harold Perrineau Terrence Howard Melissa De Sousa and Sanaa Lathan. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) People who turn up as characters in novels written by old friends are not always overjoyed about it. Fiction writers have a tendency to tell the truth. In ""The Best Man"" Taye Diggs (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"") plays Harper a young novelist who is also apparently a bodybuilder and the best man at his football-star buddys big wedding. The comedy turns on the sexual crosscurrents among characters in Harpers first novel and some members of the wedding party who read themselves into the book. The self-righteous bridegroom wants to call the wedding off and frankly it will come to seem like a good idea but not for the reason he gives. Related Stories The Truth Hurts in `Best Man / Novel stirs up trouble in wedding comedy Morris Chestnut (""Boyz N the Hood"") plays Lance the hot-tempered bridegroom who has the curious notion that marriage will put an end to his wandering eye. At the same time he insists that his bride be a virgin. The glossy ensemble cast is consistently interesting. Harold Perrineau and Melissa De Sousa play an ill-matched couple (hes a wuss and shes self-dramatizing to say the least). Terrence Howard doesnt miss a thing as a guitar-playing truth- teller. Nia Long is a television director who has a history with the novelist and Sanaa Lathan is Harpers caterer-girlfriend who may have her head screwed on better than any other character. The movie was produced by Spike Lees 40 Acres and a Mule company and directed by cousin Malcolm D. Lee who adroitly shows the cracks in the veneer of upper-middle-class manners surrounding spiffy weddings like this one. ..

Lees impressive feature debut as writer and director represents an honorable addition to the reunion genre. This seriocomic film centers on the tangled web of relationships among a clique of upwardly mobile career-oriented black friends and should play well with black viewers. Well-mounted and engaging ""The Best Man"" Malcolm D. Lees impressive feature debut as writer and director represents an honorable addition to the reunion genre still defined by John Sayles ""Return of the Secaucus Seven"" and Lawrence Kasdans ""The Big Chill."" This seriocomic film centers on the tangled web of relationships among a clique of upwardly mobile career-oriented black friends and should play well with black viewers. But Universal faces the challenge of generating crossover appeal for a story that has no white characters; with the exception of ""Waiting to Exhale"" most black romantic comedies have not been particularly successful at the B.O. Taye Diggs who was Angela Bassetts romantic interest in ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" here has a career-making role. His enormously appealing performance is reminiscent of the young Sidney Poitier in its dignity but also registers an overtly erotic charge that Poitier due to the restrictions of his times was never encouraged to develop. Diggs plays Harper Stewart a handsome ambitious writer whose first novel ""Unfinished Business"" is about to be published. In the first reel Harper leaves behind Robin (Sanaa Lathan) his sensitive new girlfriend and heads to New York to meet his old buddies and be best man in the wedding of his pal Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut) a superstar athlete and the beautiful Mia (Monica Calhoun). Initial encounter is with Jordan (Nia Long) an aggressive career-driven TV producer who was Harpers college roommate and who one night almost went to bed with him. This missed opportunity serves as a central narrative thread heightening tension over whether theyll seize their last chance to consummate their passion. As scripter Lee finds interesting ways to introduce his protagonists Quentin (Terrence Howard) a guitar-playing womanizer who gets to deliver the most cynical lines; Murch (Harold Perrineau) the polite gentleman whos too nice for his own good particularly when socializing with his domineering g.f. Shelby (Melissa De Sousa); and Candy (Regina Hall) a stripper who unexpectedly discloses a poetic streak and changes Murchs life. Like most reunion films ""The Best Man"" deals with coming of age specifically how young adults are forced to embrace the responsibilities of adulthood. The characters are bright and successful but they have gone through life without honestly facing their emotions. Theyre beginning to recognize the need to resolve old conflicts and heal open wounds. And while its not surprising that most of the storys tensions are of a romantic or sexual nature Lees deft script goes beyond schematic crises and stereotypical situations offering enough dramatic twists and comic turns to keep the saga entertaining and less predictable than it might otherwise be. One of the running jokes (a la Woody Allens ""Deconstructing Harry"") is the slow sometimes painful and sometimes hilarious realization on the part of the protagonists that they resemble characters in Harpers steamy novel. And Lee sketches an intriguing subplot that dissects trust and fidelity and their impact on the very nature of friendship. Theres no preferential treatment of the men Revelations and inner turmoil motivate all the characters to grow and transform in a positive way. This is particularly true of Harper who begins as a role model envied by his male friends and adored by the women but who as the story evolves increasingly reveals weaknesses that make him a more human and flawed hero. Besides its connection to recent black ensemble pics (""love jones"" ""Hav Plenty"") the narrative echoes such wedding films as Nancy Savocas ""True Love"" describing the intense anxiety of last-minute preparations. Pic applies the typical male fear of commitment and the ritual of sleazy bachelor parties to an African-American milieu. Though there are not many overtly sexual scenes the movie is charged with a healthy eroticism which is accentuated by the fact that all the thesps are extremely attractive and seductively dressed. Pic reps the progression from black cinemas drugs-and-violence tales of the early 1990s to more mature dialogue-driven work. Chestnut who gives a strong and touching rendition of a jealously aggressive yet Bible-reading guy coerced to examine his double-standard ethics was in ""Boyz N the Hood"" and the sexy Long played the lead in ""love jones."" ""The Best Man"" gets too preachy and reconciliatory in the last reel and it could benefit from a 10-minute trim in the first hour. But overall this smooth glossy enjoyable film showcases an impressive new authorial voice. The Best ManProductionA Universal Pictures release of a 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks production.

"The Best Man (R) Related Item ""The Best Man"" showtimes The Best Man A Joyous Occasion By Lonnae ONeal Parker Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 22 1999 Taye Diggs and Nia Long in ""The Best Man."" (Universal) Director Malcolm Lee Cast Nia Long; Taye Diggs; Morris Chestnut; Harold Perrineau Jr.; Terrence Dashon Howard; Sanaa Lathan; Monica Calhoun; Melissa DeSousa; Victoria Dillard Running Time 2 hours Contains profanity adult situations and semi-nudity Everybody knows the freaky happenings jump off at weddings. They are a ritual confluence of women in tight dresses groomsmen on the make and Uncle Morris doing the electric slide. Drama love and great sexpectations. And in the hilarious romantic comedy ""The Best Man"" add to the mix a few secrets better left untold - not to mention unwritten unpublished and definitely unread by the groom. This smart debut from filmmaker Malcolm D. Lee cousin to the films producer Spike centers around a group of old friends who reunite in New York for a wedding. Tapping into the Zeitgeist of young black professionals starving to see themselves on film it hits all the right cultural touchstones from BET to Stevie Wonder Chubb Rock to bid whist. Although the film is produced by Spike Lee dont expect racial politics. And while comparisons to another black wedding-themed movie starring Taye Diggs ""The Wood"" are bound to come up resist. As we peek behind the scenes at a bachelor party and eavesdrop on some soul-to-soul free associating over a game of cards the movie reveals something we seldom see. Ambience smart sharp dialogue and characters who care deeply but still call each other on their petty macho shortcomings make it a kind of ""Big Chill"" for black folks. Taye Diggs (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" ""The Wood"") with abdominal muscles like the speed bumps in a high school parking lot stars as the title character bookish commitment-shy Harper Stewart an author whose characters bear a strong resemblance to his buddies. Although his novel ""Unfinished Business"" hasnt been released former almost-flame Jordan played hot and determined by Nia Long (""Soul Food"") has scored an advance copy that is making its way through the wedding party. It turns out to be a real page-turner for these college chums who are searching for answers and find plenty. They see themselves warts and all in the pages and some see a way to rewrite their stories. Jordan a television producer who missed her chance to get busy with Harper in college is determined to get him horizontal before his girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan) arrives for the wedding. Morris Chestnut (""Boyz N the Hood"" ""G.I. Jane"") plays the groom Lance a pro football player who is hoping that marriage to his sweet college girlfriend Mia (Monica Calhoun) will cure his womanizing. The cast is rounded out perfectly by Murch (Harold Perrineau Jr.) a boho who desperately needs a little backbone to stand up to his girlfriend Shelby and Quentin (Terrence Howard) a pimp-daddy playa who is so blazingly funny we want him spun off into his own TV show. The male characters in ""The Best Man"" especially resonate each representing a facet of black manhood that is typically obscured by the tired recycled gangsta-thug-get-the-ho-make-the-money stories moviegoers are constantly served. Howards Quentin comes closest to this stereotype but deepens the character He is at once vulgar and vulnerable capable of insight and introspection. And ready to shed a tear during the vows which makes for the best kind of keeping it real. In the world of popular Hollywood cinema black characters rarely seem to be more than cardboard cutouts the requisite hoodlum ghetto goddess or chief of security. Not so in ""The Best Man."" You know these dudes. You grew up with them went to school with them. Maybe even married one of them. They are ethnic without being trite and one-dimensional; their stories about embracing adulthood taking on responsibility and paying the overdue bills for past imperfections seem universal. And while it would be special to get as much nuance into the female characters - Shelby (Melissa DeSousa) particularly is a black American princess caricature - alas it is clear they provide little more than laughs and window dressing as the brothers work out some kind of postmodern post-N.W.A. angst. The films ending will no doubt be rehashed in barber shops sports bars and dorm rooms for a long time to come. ""The Best Man"" raises the classic question ""What would you do if . . . ?"" And while maybe it glosses over some of the answers a little it is so good to hear and so pretty to look at that it still manages to feel like some kind of honeymoon.

"Dreadful Script Forces `Best Man Actors To Ham It Up - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.Dreadful Script Forces `Best Man Actors To Ham It UpOctober 22 1999|By Barbara Shulgasser. Special to the Tribune.Like another recent film ""The Wood"" writer-director Malcolm D. Lees ""The Best Man"" focuses on a group of old friends -- all of them black and upper-middle class -- who are hoping that their buddy a reluctant groom will show up for his wedding. How theyve come to this situation is the subject in both films for a series of belabored flashbacks.Taye Diggs who is in both films plays Harper Stewart the title character. Harper has written a tell-all novel about his circle of friends. Unfortunately a few prepublication copies are circulating. Revelations therein are sure to strain relations with his friends and possibly jeopardize the romance between football star Lance (Morris Chestnut) and Mia (Monica Calhoun) who are about to be married.Harper has left his lovely girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan also of ""The Wood"") back in Chicago when he departs for a few days of fun in New York before the wedding. Ever-patient Robin due to arrive the day of the event knows that Harper is suffering from commitment phobia and a longing to reconnect with the highly dysfunctional girl of his dreams (played by Nia Long).For the most part the actors are forced to ham it up in order to get through cliche-ridden scenes but a few manage to overcome the burden. Chestnut as the groom conveys a sweetness and devotion to friendship and to his fiance that is often touching. And Terrence Howard playing Quentin Harpers most cynical buddy is a joy to watch.Lee worked with Spike Lee (his cousin) on ""Clockers"" and Spike is the producer of ""The Best Man."" Malcolm Lee is lucky to have such a powerful sponsor. It is great to see films about blacks that dont focus on race drugs or poverty but rather on everyday concerns of love fidelity and commitment. But this doesnt make ""The Best Man"" a good film.``THE BEST MAN(star)Directed and written by Malcolm D.

Lee pours on the gee-whiz cheer in The Best Man a wedding-weekend reunion story coproduced by his cousin Spike. The trigger for a predictable round of arguments fistfights and shack-ups is the barely fictionalized first novel that Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) has published just as he joins his old college pals to see one of them hitched. To his consternation he finds theyve skimmed the book already and are less than pleased; in the patently expository words of one friend ""Youve always analyzed everybody elses s - - but you never do that for yourself."" Leaning heavily on handsomely lit close-ups of a cast that includes Nia Long Morris Chestnut and Ozs Harold Perrineau Lee moves from airport arrival to reception-hall line dance in a style thats always clothing-catalog pretty even when the guys trade howlingly nasty ideas about professional women. Says the football-star groom of the TV-producer maid of honor ""Lets face it a woman like that dont need no man. Shes one step from lesbian."" Its a tribute to the actors appeal that they can sling this hash and keep our sympathies but they cant squeeze much drama from pure soap.
