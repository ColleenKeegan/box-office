"The Love Letter An Unsigned Letter Sends the Sparks Flying May 21 1999 FILM REVIEW The Love Letter An Unsigned Letter Sends the Sparks Flying Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Video Selected Scenes and Trailer From the Film Forum Join a Discussion on Current Film By STEPHEN HOLDEN oblolly by the Sea the jauntily named New England town that is the setting for ""The Love Letter"" is the kind of idyllic seaside retreat that could exist only in a cheery childrens folk song or a yuppie sitcom. The place radiates an alarming perkiness. And for its first three-quarters ""The Love Letter"" which takes place in the summer hurtles toward a seemingly inevitable fairy-tale ending in which its nice middle-class characters all end up snugly coupled before the first nip of autumn frost. The best thing about this cute-as-a-button screen adaptation of Cathleen Schines whimsical romantic novel is that the story ends up defying expectations. Once its characters have been magically awakened to the romantic possibilities of their lives by a stray document most of them dont end up sharing Nora Ephron moments. Whats not so wonderful about this wisp of a movie directed by Peter Ho-sun Chan from a screenplay by Maria Maggenti is its bland dialogue and dull sitcom acting. When the movies over you are hard put to remember a single scrap of dialogue beyond a couple of sour quips from one character (played by Ellen DeGeneres) who pretty much disappears halfway into the film. ""The Love Letter"" revolves around Helen MacFarquhar (Kate Capshaw) an attractive divorced woman in her 40s who runs a local bookstore and spends her spare hours jogging. Helen who fields irritated phone calls from an ex-husband who complains about having to pay for everything lives a life of contented celibacy. Or so she imagines until one day she finds a mysterious love letter unsigned and addressed to no one tucked in her mail. The letter isnt especially steamy but it is ardent. And suddenly Helens erotic imagination which has been shut down goes into overdrive. In Woody Allen-like fantasy sequences she imagines everyone in her orbit secretly drooling over her. ADVERTISEMENT One likely possibility is Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) a 20-year-old college student who has a summer job in the bookstore. Dropping by Helens for dinner one night he accidentally discovers the love letter on the kitchen counter tucked under a bottle of wine and assumes she deliberately left it there for him to find. By the end of the evening each is secretly convinced the other is the author and before long the two embark on a passionate affair. Meanwhile a more age-appropriate suitor George (Tom Selleck) who has been in love with Helen since they were in high school together and who is in the final throes of a divorce starts hanging around and wagging his bushy tail. The sudden blossoming of romantic possibility among these and several other characters sets up expectations that ""The Love Letter"" could evolve into the sort of luxuriant rumination on age youth and Eros that Eric Rohmer has turned into a cottage industry in France. But the deeper literary resonances of Ms. Schines novel have been so thoroughly bleached out of the film that Helen and Johnnys May-September relationship has no depth or poignancy. Beyond her generic snippiness and his generic ingenuousness these two are devoid of personality. Eventually Helens mother (Blythe Danner) and grandmother (Gloria Stuart) turn up in Loblolly. The new set of relationships they introduce arrives in the film so late that theyve barely registered before the final credits are rolling. And not a minute too soon. PUBLICATION NOTES THE LOVE LETTER Rating ""The Love Letter"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has glimpses of nudity and sexual situations. Directed by Peter Ho-sun Chan; written by Maria Maggenti based on the novel by Cathleen Schine; director of photography Tami Reiker; edited by Jacqueline Cambas; music by Luis Bacalov; production designer Andrew Jackness; produced by Sarah Pillsbury Midge Sanford and Kate Capshaw; released by Dreamworks Pictures. Running time 88 minutes. This film is rated R.

Starring Kate Capshaw Tom Everett Scott Ellen DeGeneres and Tom Selleck. Directed by Peter Chan. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Long ago in a Hollywood far away they used to make movies like ""The Love Letter."" Movies were different then. No graphic sex. No overt demonstrations of lust. (They could have used a dose of both.) But the stories and emotions of those old Bette Davis movies were not unlike those in ""The Love Letter"" A middle-aged lady gets bruised and jostled on the bumpy road to love. Kate Capshaw is the woman this time. She plays Helen the owner of one of those cozy little bookshops where the people are kind and civilized and the books are sold at full price. She lives in the sort of New England town usually described as ""sleepy"" where things are so quiet that people can hear their lives ticking by. As the 40-year-old Helen Capshaw is beautiful at 45 an age at which her predecessors Davis and Joan Crawford were getting ready to haunt houses. Capshaws looks come in handy here. While minding her own business Helen becomes the object of passionate desire for two men one her own age (Tom Selleck) and one 20 years younger (Tom Everett Scott). Thats the kick of the movie. Female viewers should appreciate the plot on principle while men will enjoy Capshaw. Everyone makes out. ""The Love Letter"" is a whimsical (but not too whimsical) romance about what happens when a woman finds an anonymous love letter and assumes that it has been written to her. That the love letter itself is a pretty weak piece of writing is one of the smart touches of the movie -- love has made her goofy. The writer says he (or she) thinks about his beloved always ""When I tie my shoe . . . when I peel an orange . . ."" These lines are repeated over and over until they become ridiculous. Various people find the letter and as a result they change the way they act toward one another and romances start. The story is charming though routine. But two things elevate ""The Love Letter"" above the ordi nary its light tone and its performances. For the tone thank Peter Chan a Hong Kong director best known for Maggie Cheungs ""Comrades Almost a Love Story"" (which is being revived today at the Four Star Theatre). Chan could have blown it by making ""The Love Letter"" too heavy or by framing the tale within an enchanted atmosphere. ""Enchanted"" is usually the worst heaviness pretending to be lightness. Instead Chan keeps a delicate hand on the story and actors. Capshaw strikes the perfect balance making Helen sympathetic while allowing the audience to laugh at her romantic complications. ""I never felt this way before"" her young lover tells her. ""Of course not"" she answers miserably. ""Youre 20"" Casting Blythe Danner as Capshaws mother was a mistake -- when did Mom have her when she was 10? But Gloria Stuart as Helens 88-year-old grandmother is a spry delight and shows what she can do when not forced to act Yoda-like as she did in ""Titanic."" Tom Selleck one of the best and most underused leading men around is his usual big sensitive easygoing self as a fellow whos been pining for Helen for 30 years. Ellen DeGeneres is a bookshop assistant who has a falling-out with Helen. ""The Love Letter"" is a quiet sane little movie for adults not an art film not a European wallow not a low-budget independent. Perhaps if more Hollywood movies were like this ""The Love Letter"" wouldnt stand out. But in the current climate its like a warm spring day.

Capshaws Helen MacFarquhar is a 40ish divorced mom who owns a cozy little bookstore in the cozy little New England town of Loblolly By The Sea. One day alone in the store she discovers an anonymously typed love letter -- an epistle of devotion -- stuffed between the pillows of her couch. Convinced it was intended for her she sets about trying to uncover the identity of her secret admirer and she quickly settles on Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) a winsome college hunk whos in town for the summer. She invites him to dinner and when he happens upon the love letter in her bathroom he becomes convinced that Helen wrote it and intended it for him. Theres a glimmer of a winning satirical-romantic idea in this serenely understated mix-up plot. After all if the merest illusion that someone has a crush on you is enough to ignite your hormones it says much about all the potential erotic depth charges hidden in our everyday lives. Yet The Love Letter which Capshaw coproduced is glum static remote -- a weirdly repressed comedy of misplaced yearning. Its like Message in a Bottle without the shameless misty-hokey extravagance. Helen and Johnny embark on a passionate sexual fling and pleased as I am to see Hollywood present a frank portrait of an older woman/younger man relationship this has to be one of the least urgent passionate sexual flings in the history of movies. Tom Everett Scott so winning in That Thing You Do is a couple of shades too callow in his naive ardor here and sleeping with Johnny doesnt appear to do much for Helens mood. She starts out depressed and then becomes...a little less depressed. Kicking off with Louis Armstrongs rendition of ""Im In the Mood for Love"" The Love Letter feels like the worst Nora Ephron movie that Nora Ephron never made. It wants to revel in rapture and grand illusions and timeless dreams yet its vision of love is overly graphed out and willed. As it happens theres a second love note mysterious in a different way and a second suitor as well George (Tom Selleck) a lifelong chum of Helens who is desperate to get together with her after all these years. Without revealing too much let me just say that Selleck acts uh nice and that this relationship is resolved in a way that is not going to set anyones soul on fire. Kate Capshaw is right to be trying for stardom again but this much modesty doesnt become her. In The Love Letter shes a lioness impersonating a mouse.

"The Love Letter (R) Related Item ""The Love Letter"" showtimes Letter Just a Trifling Note By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 21 1999 Kate Capshaw and Tom Everett Scott read between the lines in ""The Love Letter."" (DreamWorks) Director Peter Chan Cast Kate Capshaw; Tom Selleck; Ellen DeGeneres; Tom Everett Scott; Blythe Danner; Gloria Stuart Running Time 1 hours 30 minutes Contains discreet sexual scenes out of focus nudity and a few choice words When you watch a tres tres slim love story coming from DreamWorks SKG which just happens to star the wife of Steven Spielberg - hes the ""S"" in SKG - you have to wonder. Kate Capshaw may be an engaging performer but as the lead in a summer romance her name will hardly cause movie marquees to glow with white heat. Nevertheless the sell is on. DreamWorks sweetened the pot with Ellen DeGeneres Tom Selleck and Blythe Danner. They opened the movie against that well-known light saber movie hoping to garner the hype-avoiders. And in an attempt to outplay the Lucas hype machine they blanketed critics with love letters containing the text of the fictional letter that figures so strategically in the movie. The idea was to fool and thrill the recipients so that theyd understand the excitement felt by Capshaws character when she receives the same missive. ""Dearest"" it begins. ""Do you know how in love with you I am? Did I trip? Did I stumble? Lose my balance graze my knee . . . graze my heart?"" My reaction upon receiving the letter was ""Oh great. An accident-prone psychotic who writes badly has fallen in love with me."" Unfortunately ""The Love Letter"" directed by Peter Ho-sun Chan doesnt have anything close to such melodrama. And romantically speaking it isnt quite the rhapsodic experience one would hope for. Helen MacFarquhar (Capshaw) a single woman who works in a sleepy New England bookstore discovers this letter assumes its for her and starts wondering about the unsigned author. Whos so crazy about her? Could it be her longtime friend George (Selleck) who seems to be sweet on her? Or is it Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) a college student who always seems to be hanging around? Helens ears are so attuned for clues shes amenable to any kind of vibration from either man. That letter has a mischievous effect on everyone. When it accidentally falls into Johnnys hands he assumes Helen sent it to him. When Helens bookstore colleague Janet (DeGeneres) discovers it she assumes George sent it to her. And so on. Complications abound. Lovers are caught in a web of misunderstanding but in the process everyone feels the glow. Well thats the idea. ""The Love Letter"" is disarmingly lighthearted. And everyone does their itty-bitty part to make this thing work Capshaw brings unpretentious grace to her role. DeGeneres reels out the usual sitcom-sharpened shtick. Selleck hides his good looks behind a thick set of glasses and lets out his charm in small doses. And Scott plays a 20-year-old whos goofily obsessed with the idea of romance with an older woman. But if that letter is pedestrian enough the writing on the wall is even more obvious. Helens real candidate is a no-brainer from the get-go. And when we learn the true author - which becomes less and less compelling as the movie slumps along - its such an out-of-left-field punch line youre left wishing youd never opened this letter.

But now shes back in front of and behind the camera as star and producer (with veteran producers Sarah Pillsbury and Midge Sanford) of the new romantic comedy ""The Love Letter."" It was Capshaw who tracked down author Cathleen Schine and optioned the rights to her book of the same title based on a review she read in the New York Times. At that point her husband who knows a thing or two about movies asked if his DreamWorks Studio could have a chance to consider making it. DreamWorks gave it a green light. MULTIMEDIA Theatrical preview for ""The Love Letter"" Windows Media 28K 80K ""Pauls Pix"" for ""The Love Letter"" Windows Media 28K 80K The story is set in the fictional New England town of Loblolly By The Sea -- where love is in the air. An anonymous love letter lands in the hands of a local bookstore owner named Helen played with compassion and intelligence by Capshaw. Helen is a single mother whos leading a calm and controlled life that doesnt include romantic involvements. But now shes suddenly on a quest to find the writer of this sweet and touching message thats shaken her world. The problem? Who exactly will she find at the end of that quest -- is the letter even meant for her? Looking for Mr. Goodbar Could the letter be from her old friend George played by Tom Selleck? After all this divorced firefighter with two young daughters has been in love with Helen for years. Or perhaps its from Johnny played by Tom Everett Scott -- he starred in ""That Thing You Do"" directed by Spielbergs friend Tom Hanks. Johnnys a young man working for Helen during his summer vacation from college. Then again was the letter really meant for Janet? Thats Helens oversexed best friend whos convinced the epistle is for her. Janet played with grace and humor by Ellen DeGeneres is convinced that George is secretly in love with her not Helen. And how do Helens mother Lillian (Blythe Danner) and the mysterious Miss Scattergoods (British character actress Geraldine McEwan) fit into all this? After everyone has chased everyone with some very embarrassing results all leads prove fruitless. Just who sent the letter? And to whom? The mystery is at last solved in the final reel. Light comedy light touch This is a light comedy-mystery guided with an equally light hand by Chinese director Peter Ho-sun Chan (""Comrades Almost A Love Story""). To borrow a line from ""Cool Hand Luke"" ""What weve got here is a failure to communicate."" Nobody in this film is facing or expressing his or her true inner feelings. So miscommunication abounds. The film gets off to a very promising start and then sags a bit in the middle. It never gets quite as romantic or as funny as it could be but theres a very strong ending that may well take you totally by surprise. A special mention must go to actress Julianne Nicholson. She plays Jennifer one of Helens bookstore employees whos affected by the letter. Jennifer has a large crush on young Johnny. Nicholson has worked mainly in small independent films but she brings a magnificent sense of vulnerability and longing to her character here. When shes on screen its hard to look anywhere else. And Gloria Stuart ""Titanic"" has the small cameo role of Eleanor Helens grandmother. You might feel sorry for Scott at times. He plays his role just fine. But can you imagine being half-naked and having love scenes with Spielbergs wife in a DreamWorks movie? Talk about performance anxiety ""The Love Letter"" opens nationwide on Friday May 21 and is rated PG-13 with a running time of 89 minutes.

As counterprogramming goes ""The Love Letter"" definitely offers an alternative to ticketbuyers in search of something other than Force-fed thrills and spills. But even under the best of circumstances -- i.e. not opening within days of ""Star Wars Episode I -- The Phantom Menace"" -- a beguilingly low-key pic such as this would have a hard time attracting masses to the multiplexes. Older ticketbuyers may turn out in adequate number for DreamWorks to reap a modest profit. More attention will be paid however after ""Letter"" is forwarded to homevideo and pay cable. Set in the sort of picturesque New England hamlet where everyone knows everyone elses business -- or at least assume that they do -- ""Love Letter"" is a gentle and generous-spirited comedy-drama with a decidedly European flavor. Kate Capshaw (who co-produced with Sarah Pillsbury and Midge Sanford) is first among equals in a strong ensemble cast as Helen MacFarquhar a divorced bookstore owner who inadvertently upsets the routine normalcy of her mundane world. When she finds an unsigned and extremely passionate love letter in her store Helen is thoroughly discombobulated -- and intensely curious. Almost anyone in her orbit could have typed the missive so just about everyone is a suspect. Is George (Tom Selleck) the local fireman whos a longtime friend her secret admirer? Has Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) a close buddy and faithful employee written about a love that dares not speak its name? Or maybe Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) a 20-year-old college student whos working for the summer at her bookstore wants a sentimental education from the fortysomething Helen. As Helen considers these and other possibilities she imagines each person reading the words of the letter in a mildly amusing fantasy sequence. But ""Love Letters"" is much funnier and more affecting when it sticks to real-world complications. Johnny also finds the letter assumes it is meant for him -- and enthusiastically responds to misinterpreted mixed signals from Helen. Then the letter passes on to Janet who reveals a girlishly romantic streak beneath her cynical facade when she assumes shes being courted by the hunky George. ""Love Letter"" marks the U.S. debut of Hong Kong filmmaker Peter Ho-sun Chan (""Comrades Almost a Love Story"") who proves totally at ease with both the universality of human emotions and the specifics of small-town New England life. Working from a warm and witty screenplay by Maria Maggenti (""The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love"") based on a novel by Cathleen Schine Chan keeps the circles within circles spinning in a brisk and captivating fashion. It comes as no great surprise when the easygoing and self-effacing George reveals that hes always been in love with Helen even when each was married to someone else. What is surprising is the sweetly sympathetic performance given by Selleck in his best bigscreen outing to date. Likewise its not exactly a shock when Helen and Johnny get horizontal -- and vertical -- despite the difference in their ages. But their intimacy is all the more engaging because nobody makes a big deal about it. (Well OK Helen makes a big deal and has serious second thoughts but only after the fact.) In most other romantic comedies a cross-generational romance between a young man and an older woman would be the sole focus of the plot. In ""Love Letter"" however the romance is just one element in the mosaic. As Lillian (Blythe Danner) Helens bemused mother remarks ""Very French your affair with him."" At a pared-to-essentials 88 minutes ""Love Letter"" inevitably gives short shrift to some intriguing supporting characters. As a result the final revelation of the letters true author doesnt have the satisfying resonance that it should because the audience doesnt learn quite enough about the bonds between writer and reader. But the well-cast actors do their considerable best to flesh out their sketchy roles. In addition to DeGeneres and Danner the standouts include Justine Nicholson as another summertime bookstore employee Geraldine McEwan as a dry-witted local eccentric and Gloria Stuart (""Titanic"") as Eleanor Helens presumptuous grandmother. How presumptuous? When she comes for a ""short"" visit shes accompanied by a moving van filled with furniture. Of course the heart of the story is the romantic triangle formed by Helen Johnny and George. Capshaw hits all the right notes as a woman whos fearful of making a fool of herself but even more fearful of losing what may be her last best chance for love. Scott does a fine job of appearing vulnerable without seeming weak self-assured without seeming cocksure and Selleck is extremely effective as a man whos smart enough to realize that happiness may be forever out of reach and stubborn enough to keep grasping anyway. Tech package is sufficient to enhance the overall mood of wistful romanticism. Of particular note are Tami Reikers graceful cinematography and Luis Bacalovs understated score.
