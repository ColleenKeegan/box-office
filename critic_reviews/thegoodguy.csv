E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Were it smarter or more entertaining or simply better made ""The Good Guy could have been a decent anthropological survey of the Wall Street wilderness. The scheming the starch the self-regard. It instead wants to be a romantic drama. Thats a mistake. For that you would need high stakes shameless acting and the sense that love means something more than falling for a banker because he too likes ""Pride and Prejudice. ""The Good Guy sits several rungs lower. Its network television drama starring actors best known for their TV work and full of the petty gripes and mild worries of characters who really have nothing compelling to worry about.Its tough to tell this movie from ""Men in Trees ""One Tree Hill ""October Road ""Raising the Bar or ""The Deep End shows with young people trying to figure out their lives. Thats the flaccid gist of ""The Good Guy. Beth (Alexis Bledel ""Gilmore Girls) likes two men. Tommy (Scott Porter ""Friday Night Lights) makes a lot of money at an investment bank. Daniel (Bryan Greenberg ""October Road) works with Tommy but he likes technology and women who do more than hope bankers pick them up. Which man will she wind up with? Who cares?Beth and Tommy just started dating but because hes seeing other people hes rarely around and permits her to spend time with Daniel because Daniel is so square. Porter would actually be OK in a character study about a sociopathic moneyman whose high is picking up women. Hes corrosively arrogant - which is not to say hes interesting.Presumably to shake things up Beth is a conservationist. Its a line of work that rarely comes into play. She and Tommy never fight about the green industries hes lucratively betting against. She and Daniel never bond over the joys of composting. Although all those shots of her just sitting in Central Park or at her kitchen table suggest that a pitiful amount of imaginative screenwriting is being conserved.While Beth waits for the phone to ring and we wait for Tommy to overreact to Daniels friendship with Beth men in nice shirts sit in front of computer screens talk about money and go out to drink and pick up women. The truth is that there are very few ways in our current socioeconomic climate to create conscionable young capitalists.When Tommy and his coworkers compete for phone numbers its like watching a CNBC nature special. When Tommy drags Daniel to Greenwich Village for a makeover its odd since Tommy is just as generically dressed as any guy who spills his drink on you - worse actually. But this movie written and directed by Julio DePietro seems unaware of how obnoxious and dull these men are. Otherwise wed be spending more time with Beth in eco-ville. As it turns out were better off. Bledel is emotionally monochromatic and Beths friends are man junkies.Their book club features very little book talk (for what its worth Humbert Humbert is described as a hopeless romantic) and a lot of drooling over Daniel. As it happens Greenberg is the only thing to recommend about the movie. Fortunately since hes currently starring in a similar but much better new HBO show ""How to Make It in America I can recommend that instead.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

The Good Guy has a few half-cute moments some chuckles and enough pretty faces to cast at least two TV pilots. What it doesnt have is a clue. One by one each scene goes slack as the script struggles with Screenwriting 101 problems like who the main character is and what he wants -- not to mention why any of us should care in the first place.

(Handout) BY Joe Neumaier Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITICS Thursday February 18 2010 302 PM Blood Done Sign My Name3 starsBiopic about a segregated Southern town. At the Empire 25 (208). PG-13 Violence language.Though it cant quite transcend its filmmakers earnest intentions this solemn history lesson offers several powerful moments.Writer/director Jeb Stuart bases his script on a memoir by Tim Tyson whose preacher father (played by Rick Schroder) arrives in Oxford N.C. in 1970. Segregation still has a firm stronghold in this conservative town and its clear that any change will be met with violent resistance. Schroder is the most recognizable name but hes limited by a two-dimensional character. More successful is lesser-known co-star Nate Parker playing a young black teacher determined to educate and inspire. Perhaps his role is so compelling because Stuart clearly hopes to do the same. Elizabeth WeitzmanHappy Tears1 starTwo sisters care for their off-the-deep-end dad. At the Angelika (135). R Language drug use sexuality. A cringe-inducing self-consciously kooky indie comedy thats best enjoyed for its taste of Rip Torn who judging by his recent alleged bank break-in comes to loose-cannon stuff naturally. Here the 76-year-old Torn is the cracked-off-his-cob pa of two disparate sisters (Demi Moore Parker Posey) each carrying an awful upbringing into a messed-up adult life.Still they arrive to care for Dad in his dementia running afoul of each other as well as Dads hopped-up pseudo-nurse girlfriend (an irritating-beyond-belief Ellen Barkin).Writer-director Mitchell Lichtenstein made the out-there horror flick ""Teeth"" in 2007; this movie is like a regional theater troupes toothless homage to John Waters. Joe NeumaierPhyllis and Harold2 starsDocumentary about a Long Island couples nearly 60-year marriage. At Cinema Village (124). Not rated.  Filmmaker Cindy Kleines examination of her parents long contentious marriage is clear-eyed but complex. Together since the late 1930s Phyllis and Harold Kleine lived a life together on Long Island but inside their hearts they differed dramatically. Phyllis in love with another man since her early 20s went decade after decade wondering how she married and raised two daughters with someone so unlike herself; Harold a grumbling stodgy former dentist thought things were fine. In Happy Tears Demi Moore and Parker Posey play sisters caring for their elderly father played by Rip Torn (not shown). (Handout) Phylliss rekindling of her 50-year-old affair is evidence to the contrary. Engrossing sad and heartbreaking. J.N.The Last New Yorker2 starsAn elderly city dweller faces changes in his life and his town. At the Quad (130). Not rated. Serious old-time Big Appleness oozes from every rant kvetch and observation Lenny (""Sopranos"" vet Dominic Chianese) and Ruben (Dick Latessa) make in ""The Last New Yorker"" a film from photographer-turned-director Harvey Wang. Fast-walking down the streets Lenny knows his town inside out ticking off whats right and wrong and how to live in it as Ruben trots along behind him. Ruben for his part hates the cruelty and coldness he feels a reality Lenny experiences too when his savings go south. But with a new love interest (Kathleen Chalfant) and a scheme to get ahead Lenny is undaunted.  Wang tracks his guys like the documentarian he is and if the movie feels a bit canned thanks to Adam Forgashs unoriginal script classic NYC spots and a big heart make it feel like home. J.N.The Good Guy2 starsTwo men fall for the same woman. At the Empire 25 (130). R Language sexuality.Theres too little difference between the good guys and the bad guys in Julio DePietros uninspired debut a slickly cynical romance destined to be quickly forgotten. Alexis Bledel is Beth a wide-eyed liberal who gets involved with two Wall Street moneymakers sensitive Daniel (Bryan Greenberg) and obnoxious Tommy (Scott Porter). We learn early on that someones going to get hurt so the biggest surprise is that DePietro couldnt even muster the slightest hint of a twist. Regardless the only character of real interest is the boys greedy boss played with gleeful spite by Andrew McCarthy.With its cash-flashing men and dirty-talking women the movie already feels dated. But it wouldnt have been much fun five years ago either. E.W. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Review The Good Guy - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Review The Good GuyThe film deals with hearts and bonds (the stock market and the emotional kind) in the competitive environment of Wall Street.February 19 2010|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic Scott Porter and Alexis Bedel are the not-always-happy couple. (Roadside Attractions )If youve ever wondered whether it is possible for a fast-track Wall Street player to have a heart ""The Good Guy"" makes a run at answering that question spending some quality time at the intersection of stock traders and romantic bonds. The result is a more-clever-than-most window into modern urban yuppie mating rituals tracking just how tough it is to keep a grip on love and the corporate ladder at the same time. The film stars Alexis Bledel as Beth the good girl stranded on that dangerous corner. Scott Porter excellent as the paralyzed former football star in ""Friday Night Lights"" is her hot broker/hot boyfriend Tommy and Bryan Greenberg who was adorably sexy as Uma Thurmans young lover and Meryl Streeps son in the little-seen ""Prime"" portrays the new guy on Tommys trading team who might be falling for Beth too. With that triangle as his base in this promising first feature writer-director Julio DePietro sets about connecting the dots so we can follow the shifting alliances debts friendships and betrayals that pile up like overdue bills. In the process he does a decent job of keeping the clichA(c)s that tend to smother romances like this mostly at bay. Drawing on his stint at a Chicago investment firm DePietro creates characters dialogue and situations that feel authentic which makes the film relevant in unexpected ways though not as deeply as you hope hell do in the future. The filmmakers better with the boys capturing Wall Street life as a macho blood sport with its win-at-all-cost mind-set whether its a dart game after work or a multimillion-dollar deal. One of the more unsettling moments is a game the guys play a sort of high-tech musical chairs in which the last to press the buzzer when the music stops gets hit with an electric jolt. Its tough to decide whats worse the pain of the shock the perverse pleasure everyone else gets watching or that its absolutely believable. Shot for about 10 million the films extensive use of locations around Manhattan mostly begged and borrowed gives it a richer look than you might think given its modest means. That DePietro takes his time letting us get to know the characters comes as another unexpected pleasure staying with a defense of ""Pride and Prejudice"" at Beths book club for example rather than hurrying off in fear of boring us with a brief philosophical excursion. The film is interested in that slice of the city that is young affluent but not yet rich a world in which the more serious and the shallow are still figuring each other out. Tommy is the kind of guy whom success comes to naturally. He always seems to know just how to play the moment whether hes undertaking a Pygmalion transformation of Greenbergs Daniel into a player or sleuthing out a secluded garden that feels like Tuscany to soften Beths disappointment that a trip to Italys been canceled. Since this is about Wall Street and love theres more than one roller coaster to ride and sometimes its difficult to tell which one DePietro favors. The movie opens as Tommys hit bottom on the love front. Hes outside Beths apartment drenched by a downpour trying to talk his way back into her building and her heart. From that point we flash back six weeks as piece by piece the filmmaker plays around with how Tommy turned up all wet and whether he is a good guy or not. Bledel best known for her bookish goodness in ""The Gilmore Girls"" is never asked to step outside of that comfort zone which leaves the love story in need of some edge and the rest of us wondering if shell ever be able to step into more grown-up roles. The better triangle turns out to be Porter Greenberg and Wall Street where much more than other peoples money is always on the line and someone is sure to get hurt. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWall Street insiders open up for Money Never SleepsSeptember 24 2010The Columbo of Wall StreetSeptember 12 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewWall StreetHeartsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-good-guy19-2010feb19,0,1139480.story",200,thegoodguy4,thegoodguy,latimes

Meet Tommy (Scott Porter -- a k a Jason Street on ""Friday Night Lights""). Hes ""The Good Guy"" ostensibly a trader at a big Wall Street bank whos been dating Beth (Alexis Bledel) for three months. They dont seem to have much in common. Plus hes always at work or hanging with his boys. Their conversations are about things like their both being left-handed and her thoughts of moving to San Francisco. Tommys protege at work the younger Daniel (Bryan Greenberg) calls Tommy for dating advice about the girl he likes -- who turns out to be Tommys girlfriend. When Daniel finally gets to know Beth they have conversations along these scintillating lines ""So what was your favorite country that youve been to?"" ""The Good Guy"" which hopes that throwing in constant references to ""The Good Soldier"" will give it literary heft is not just a shabby ""Wall Street"" knockoff clogged with dull jargon-spewing trading-desk scenes that fail to advance the plot in any way. Its also a nondescript ""Sex and the City"" retread that gives Beth lots of dull screen time to chat about relationships with her girlfriends over cocktails or bikini waxes. The girls zingers include lines like ""Hes polite and early. Hes gay."" The boys range from Wall Street-caveman grunting (""This is not sleep-away camp. Your job is to make me rich. Period."") to weirdly unfunny locker-room chatter (""I want to touch her where she pees""). Porter who channels early-80s Tom Cruise (lots of randomly poking his index fingers in the air) is cocky without being intense or interesting. He seems less a Master of the Universe than a head waiter at an Applebees in New Jersey. Bledel is as sweetly boring as ever and yet both are saved from giving the worst performance in the piece by the guy who plays Tommys ruthless domineering boss -- Andrew McCarthy. There is a reason why McCarthy doesnt get hired to play a sharking alpha male very often. When he makes an effort to work his features into a frenzy of boiling testoster- one he looks like a petulant third-grader. Your impulse is not to throw yourself into closing the next deal but to buy him a coloring book.

"The Good Guy movie review Shallow Good Guy; should have been more faithful to the book |       NJ.com comments The Good Guy movie review Shallow Good Guy; should have been more faithful to the book Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 19 2010 at 545 AM updated February 19 2010 at 647 AM View/Post Comments Walter ThomsonAlexis Bledel is in the middle of a love triangle in ""The Good Guy.""""The Good Guy"" wants to be about a romantic triangle -- but its all rounded corners and no edge. Alexis Bledel is the young woman in the middle an urban conservationist with a hotshot boyfriend in Scott Porter a high-octane Wall Street trader. Then she meets sweet Bryan Greenberg Porters low-pressure nice-guy colleague. You know what comes next.The Good Guy (R) Roadside Attractions (90 min.) Directed by Julio DePietro. With Alexis Bledel Scott Porter Bryan Greenberg. Now playing in New York Rating note The film contains strong language and substance abuse. Stephen Whittys rating Two starsUnfortunately first-time filmmaker Julio DePietro doesnt seem to know you know. He thinks this is all rather novel -- a modern story inspired as he explains in the films production notes by Ford Madox Fords ""The Good Soldier."" If it is DePietro didnt read that classic very closely. Its not just that Fords novel is about two couples and their infidelities; its that its a story with layers peopled with characters who lie to themselves and to us. ""The Good Guy"" though is all on the surface. Greenbergs newbie broker is right from the start clearly a minnow among the sharks; Porter is a handsome user and Bledel is as in all her movies a ""nice girl."" There are no surprises. There is one flash of real interest whenever Andrew McCarthy pops up. Two decades ago he had his own run as a twentysomething romantic star; now the Brat Pack survivor gets the best part in someone elses movie as Porters foul-mouthed boss. But Bledel while sweet never makes much of an impression; even her big scenes feel like outtakes from one of the ""Traveling Pants"" movies. Greenberg is dull and lumpish; Porter is little more than a smile on its way to a toothpaste ad. Give DePietro credit for making a small budget go a long way. Although the Wall Street scenes feel cramped (Porters whole hotshot firm seems to consist of about six desks) there are a number of scenes set in fresh real-life locations. The photography is crisp the editing smooth. But whether or not DePietro realizes it this is a story weve all heard before retold here without much invention or imagination. Allusions aside this is not what Ford called ""the saddest story I have ever heard."" Its merely the oldest.

Writer-director Julio DePietro has worked in this environment and seen a lot of romantic comedies so he has the options down. Bledels Beth can ask her all-girl multi-culti book club whose reading list runs to Nabokov rather than Austen ergo ""Hes hot--if you dont do him I will"" or she can attend to her nobler instincts which kick in for the jug-eared but promisingly barrel-chested Pride and Prejudice reader (Bryan Greenberg) after much ostentatious waving from the script that her current squeeze (Scott Porter) may not be the popular go-getter he seems to be. Id like to tell you its more complicated but it really isnt despite the endless detours to Manhattan bars bookstores and trendy streets in pursuit of a love mystery that isnt. DePietro is no cynic and he means well--but he also means to corner the coveted Dear John demographic which in turn means that The Good Guy suffers from the dreary want of imagination about the specificity of twentysomething life that has sunk so many other specimens of this battered genre.
