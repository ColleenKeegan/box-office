Oh -- right here Like a parent reading his kids their favorite story Peter Jackson begins the second enthrallment in his version of J.R.R. Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings trilogy just about where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. Its a literal cliff-hanger the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) clinging to a precipice and falling -- to his doom? And now on with the story. The Two Towers clarifies Jacksons vision that the end result will be not three films but a single majestic nine-hour artifact -- one likely to become the supreme film adventure of our time. Towers while not quite so varied as Fellowship in its moods and settings has a grave gusto that energizes every moment. A pall hangs over the realm of Rohan where King Theoden (Bernard Hill) has been bewitched by the evil Saruman (Christopher Lee). Heroic Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) bands with a revived Gandalf to defend Rohan against Sarumans soldier-clones. But the films true battle is between Frodo the Hobbit (Elijah Wood) and the great Ring in his care. Frodo can feel its power to sap and seduce. He can see it too in Gollum a creepy creature who has been corrupted by having once possessed the Ring. Gollums cringing present could be the Hobbits future. Though the crepe of impending war hangs over Towers the film is vivid with melodrama conflicted love and potent new characters. Treebeard a tall sylvan sage reluctantly drawn into the conflict has the stately smiling gravity of George Bernard Shaw. And the digitized Gollum is wonderfully complex a damned creature slipping in and out of his own private hell. At first a whiny Jar Jar Binks as he might be played by Klaus Kinski Gollum soon reveals a complex pathos and a facility of expression no human actor could match. He is another example of Jacksons pursuit of a tone both entertaining and serious. No smirking allowed. Tolkien who wrote much of the trilogy during World War II denied that his tale was analogous to that great battle. Believe who will. But it is hard to miss connections with a new struggle. The Fellowship can be seen as Western democracies now besieged by the lunatic faction of Islamic fundamentalism. (Saruman as played by the tall lean bearded Lee looks eerily like Osama bin Laden.) The enemys power seems overwhelming untouchable; its ruthlessness makes strong nations shiver. ""So much death"" King Theoden says. ""What can men do against such reckless hate?"" Aragorn replies ""Ride out to meet them."" The Two Towers is a call not for pre-emptive action but to find the will and cunning to defeat an insidious foe. It is also mainly a thrilling work of film craft. --RC MAID IN MANHATTAN STARRING Jennifer Lopez Ralph Fiennes Natasha Richardson Stanley Tucci Bob Hoskins DIRECTED BY Wayne Wang Marisa (Jennifer Lopez) is a hard-pressed chambermaid in a tony hotel. Christopher (Ralph Fiennes) is a perfectly pressed nitwit -- playing at elective politics fooling around with supermodels delighting the tabloids. Marisa is single-momming an adorable son (Tyler Posey). Christopher has an adorable dog. One day she tries on a rich guests smashing new pantsuit; she looks scrumptious. He spots her in it and naturally falls in love. The usual class complications ensue. Maid in Manhattan is not so much a movie as a collection of career moves. J. Lo needs a comedy hit to support her principal activity adorning magazine covers. Fiennes needs to warm his austere British image if he hopes to become a true international star. Wayne Wang the director needs to make a movie that might elicit more than wary respect from its audience. Because screenwriter Kevin Wade has no idea stronger than the old Cinderella angle the movie must try to get by on clothes decor and an appeal to our democratic ideals. Of course this nice pretty woman should get to marry her prince. Isnt that what America is all about? Sure. But to involve us with its characters and its inevitable happy ending the movie requires some interruption -- unexpected dizziness a crazy comic outburst -- that would disrupt its complacent reliance on the stalest of conventions. --RS Previous Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page Home U.S. Politics World Business Tech Health Science Entertainment Newsfeed Living Ideas Parents Sports History The TIME Vault Magazine Subscribe Give a Gift TIME Shop Newsletters Customer Service Site Map Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Use Advertising Ad Choices (c) 2016 Time Inc.

"Cinderella With Room Service washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Cinderella With Room Service Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 13 2002 GIVE ME a second before I start reviewing ""Maid in Manhattan"" the newest - but not necessarily freshest - twist on the Cinderella story starring Jennifer Lopez as a sassy maid from the projects and Ralph Fiennes as the handsome hotel guest she falls in love with. Im just trying to recall the last time I rented a room in New York City (heck anywhere for that matter) where a member of the housekeeping staff looked that bootylicious. Ah now I remember Never. Ah well. Chalk it up to Hollywood fantasia and the parallel universe where hookers look like Julia Roberts (who by the way was originally pitched the part of the maid but turned it down) and where nobody in the working class ever gets bunions. Maybe its just that Im not staying in expensive enough lodgings. You know the kind where the hotel staff leaves lavender nosegays on your pillow and a British butler who looks like Bob Hoskins pours your cappuccino for you - and makes sure your wife doesnt run into your mistress in the lobby - all for a 50 tip. Thats the kind of place Marisa (Lopez) works. A single mom who hopes to one day graduate from the toilet-brush brigade to middle management Marisa makes the stupid mistake (or in this movie the very canny career move) of trying on a 5000 Dolce amp; Gabbana outfit belonging to a woman staying at the hotel (Natasha Richardson in a deliciously hoity-toity turn) while she is cleaning her room. J. Lo and behold Suddenly out of uniform Marisa is mistaken for a fellow guest by Christopher Marshall (Fiennes) a prettyboy politico also staying at the hotel. Marisas soon swooning under the spell of Christophers twinkly eyes and dream-date smile. Afraid that shell lose her job if she is exposed as a thieving domestic she lets him woo her. In fact she sneaks off the job for a lengthy stroll through the Central Park Zoo where the aspiring senators charm quickly wins her over despite the fact that shes a prole with a chip on her shoulder about the haves and the have-nots and hes an upper-crust Republican. Let me pause here to get something else off my chest. Im no fan of the prince-rescues-maiden-from-drudgery trope so anything that smacks of this fairy-tale shtick even when dressed up with a little class-war garnish is hard to swallow. Lets face it. Even as slickly directed by Wayne Wang from a script by Kevin Wade (based on a story by Edmond Dantes a ""Count of Monte Cristo""-inspired pseudonym for filmmaker John Hughes) ""Maid"" is still little more than a bedtime story for 12-year-old girls. That being said Lopez isnt half bad. Her Marisa is tough and tender and feels real enough even for a movie that is spun out of such Harlequin hogwash. Fiennes does a nice American accent too for a Brit but he isnt given much else to do besides looking and sounding good. I guess thats why he was cast as a politician. And what the heck - any film whose supporting cast includes in addition to Hoskins Stanley Tucci (playing Christophers high-strung spin doctor-cum-campaign manager) and the always loopy Amy Sedaris (as a stuck-up socialite sporting a tanning booth patina so deep she appears to have been baked in the oven) cant be all bad.

Jennifer Lopez is convincing as Marisa a Manhattan hotel maid who finds her prince in a wealthy guest. MAID MARRYIN / Fiennes Lopez are the best part of condescending Cinderella story 1 / 2 Back to Gallery MAID IN MANHATTAN Romantic comedy. Starring Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes. (PG-13. 97 minutes. In Bay Area theaters.) Its a match that could be made only in Hollywood Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes. That the combination is pleasing and not just tolerable -- that the sight of Fiennes putting his lizard lips on Lopez doesnt make the skin crawl but in fact seems nice -- is the saving grace of ""Maid in Manhattan"" a Cinderella story with star appeal going for it and everything else against it. Of course in a romantic comedy star appeal is the main thing. In ""Maid in Manhattan"" Lopez and Fiennes take the old story -- poor girl and rich boy meet encounter obstacles have the obligatory falling-out etc. -- and make it not new definitely not new but familiar and easy to watch. Indeed the movie would almost qualify as pleasant were it not for a certain condescension in its treatment of working-class life and its offhand assumption that lives not buoyed by riches or aggrandized by fame are hardly worth living. Its a good thing about Lopez that despite every temptation to act like a movie star she continues to Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / Maid in Manhattan dusts off old tale / Lopez Fiennes in Cinderella story grow as an actress. Here she convincingly inhabits the role of Marisa a maid in a Manhattan hotel so upscale that she not only has to clean rooms (as in a two-star) and leave a mint on the pillow (as in a three-star) but also run occasional errands for guests. Its a high-stress job requiring efficiency a healthy ego and the ability to deflect the rudeness of the wealthy clientele who sometimes assume she cant speak English and often dont even look at her. Lopez might look too glamorous to be a maid but so do most maids. As Marisa Lopez gives us a woman with enough good sense to block out the daily indignities and keep her eye on the big picture raising her 10-year-old son and angling for a management promotion. Fiennes plays Marshall a rich Republican from a political family whos running for senator. One day he meets Marisa just as shes playing dress-up in a hotel guests closet and he assumes that this lady in the white Dolce amp; Gabbana suit is from his social class. Actually if he likes her in the suit he should see her in the maids uniform The Dolce amp; Gabbana outfit is a creamy-white hideousness. I liked Fiennes in ""Maid in Manhattan."" I usually do but a Fiennes attracted to Jennifer Lopez is especially likable because hes a Fiennes who knows what he needs. He needs to loosen up and here he does. Usually so tight- lipped he can only mutter -- looking as though instead of spoken words a stream of teletype might come from his locked lips -- Fiennes from his first meeting with Lopez can smile like a human being. He can also laugh and look at another person with openness and curiosity not with his usual knowing dread. Their meeting is the real beginning of the story but alas its also the beginning of the movies slide into mediocrity. From here we get the usual series of complications that threaten to keep that special thing from happening between two lucky people. The movie strings us along which is OK but it cheats which is not OK. Screenwriter John Hughes has crafted a plot that depends on characters not telling the truth when they certainly would and never explaining even when a little explanation could solve everything. Also though it may be inevitable for a Cinderella story to honor riches rather than honest labor theres something unsettling about seeing that story transposed to modern America. Maybe Hughes and director Wayne Wang are just being realistic. Maybe when Marisa goes to a political gala (i.e. a ball) she really would become starry-eyed and not understand that shes looking at a bunch of stuffed shirts. But theres nothing at all honest about the moment when a fellow maid tells her before the gala that Marisa is doing it for all her fellow maids that her success (in getting a rich guy) will mean their success. Marisas co-worker wouldnt say it because she wouldnt think it and she wouldnt think it because it isnt true. Some will call ""Maid in Manhattan"" a fairy tale but wheres the fairy tale? After presenting a maids life as grim the movie assures us that in modern-day America its still possible for a romantic fluke to lift the occasional maid to wealth and comfort. Thats not a fairy tale. Thats about right. The fairy tale part is the idea that her friends should sing ""Hallelujah one of us got out"" while looking up from the gutter. If thats a fairy tale its a depressing one. . This movie contains sexual situations.

Even attractively cast ones. Jennifer Lopez plays a single mom and maid at a posh hotel who wants to do more than change sheets. She has a bright young son whos so into the 70s that he listens to The Best of Bread and fixates on Richard Nixon (my boy somewhere therell be a girl for you -- and only you). While shes on the job he helps her meet a Senate candidate (Ralph Fiennes) whos the kind of liberal ""feeling"" Republican who political analysts now say no longer exists because of the calcified polarization of both parties. Fiennes thinks ""the best of Bread"" is an interesting concept and he likes Mom too. Movie review Maid in Manhattan ( out of four) Stars Jennifer Lopez Ralph Fiennes Bob Hoskins Natasha Richardson Tyler Garcia Posey Director Wayne Wang Distributor Columbia Rating PG-13 for some language and sexual references Opens Friday nationwide But when J. Lo first meets him in one of the hotel rooms shes wearing a rich guests fancy duds that she has just tried on for fun. This leads Fiennes to think shes some society type with plenty of her own bread. Soon theyre getting ambushed by paparazzi as all of New York wants to know who the candidates new lady is. You know this is going to end up being a Cinderella story because Lopez would just never make it playing anyones ugly stepsister. Compared with the stars last two miserable outings --The Wedding Planner and Enough-- this one doesnt seem that bad though Ill still take Anaconda. Both the leads and supporting players try awfully hard to put the picture over; these include Stanley Tucci as a political adviser Natasha Richardson as a man-hungry guest; Bob Hoskins as the hotels No. 1 butler; and Tyler Garcia Posey as Lopezs son. Were the material not so thin it would be even more fun than it is seeing Fiennes get to be loose on screen for once. Hes pleasant but we never feel this guy could get elected. Whenever he smiles Fiennes brings to mind the title of Disneys deluxe new DVD The Complete Goofy. The director of all people is Wayne Wang a longtime specialist in art-house fare from Chan Is Missing to The Center of the World. It never hurts the resume to show that you can take on Hollywood piffle and jack it up a notch or two. But if theres an industry secret society devoted to specialists in independent low-budget films geared to grown-ups this movie just might get him booted out.

Directed by Wayne Wang from a screenplay by Kevin Wade based on a story by Edmond Dantes. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sexual language/sexual references. Several theaters. Recycling is we all know a Good Thing -- just ask screenwriter Kevin Wade who apparently was so pleased with his script for the 1988 Melanie Griffith comedy ""Working Girl"" that hes written it again. ""Maid in Manhattan"" a Cinderella story so formulaic youll be looking for a glass slipper substitutes Jennifer Lopez as an upwardly striving hotel maid for Griffiths upwardly striving secretary but its virtually the same movie minus much of the wit. In this bleak year for romantic comedies that may be more than enough to draw audiences -- and Ralph Fiennes in full cover-boy mode flashing his perfect smile and sky-blue eyes may well be worth the price of admission for some of us. But make no mistake this is Lopezs movie and Fiennes dreamboat politician is forced to compete for focus with J-Lo a cute kid a dog and a lot of wisecracking supporting characters. Director Wayne Wangs camera often seems to forget all about Fiennes leaving him in the background like a potted plant. Would that all potted plants had such cheekbones. Lopez by contrast is lovingly photographed as an angel of goodness; a soft-focus Cinderella from the Bronx named Marisa who adores her young son (Tyler Garcia Posey) is loved by her fellow maids and deserves better than what shes got (a deadbeat ex-husband and a mother who discourages her dreams of advancement). Shes tempted from perfect behavior just once -- a fellow maid urges her to try on the elegant outfit rejected by a posh guest (Natasha Richardson) -- and bingo Cupids arrow flies. Kevin Wades screenplay flirts with class consciousness but never really goes anywhere; we learn that maids ""strive to be invisible"" and are shown thumpingly that Richardsons character never really looks at Marisa. Bob Hoskins as a veteran butler/voice of wisdom intones late in the film that ""what we do does not define what we are"" a squishy sentiment thats contradicted by what actually happens in the film. So never mind the politics -- ""Maid in Manhattan"" is simply a synthetic fairy tale with little chemistry and an excuse to squeeze Lopez into a strapless pink number that resembles the gown she wore to the Oscars in real life this year. Wang has assembled a nice cast (Amy Sedaris in particular steals scenes as Richardsons snobbish pal) but doesnt keep much of a rein on them. Richardson flounders; shes got a mini-breakdown scene thats supposed to be funny but comes off as embarrassing. In the end Lopez and Fiennes kiss in front of a painted backdrop of Manhattan -- a setting as artificial as the movie itself. Can Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant appearing next week in ""Two Weeks Notice"" singlehandedly revive the dying Hollywood romantic-comedy machine? Hope springs eternal.

Although the Bronx-bred single mother and domestic engineer of the films title who cleans rooms at a Waldorf-esque hotel is stuck in the same working-stiff income bracket this graceless variation on ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Working Girl"" cannot emphasize thumpingly enough that in America lowborn circumstances are no impediment to bettering oneself - and simultaneously to bagging a prince. Especially if one is Jennifer Lopez. Theres an oversize Cinderella-slipper problem here though and it belongs to the prince. Or more specifically to a wan and watery Ralph Fiennes desperately miscast as a supposedly dashing Senate candidate who doesnt realize that the couture-clad pretty woman who dazzles him at first sight is a maid. She is after all momentarily disguised Egged on by a spunkier coworker the usually faultless Marisa is illicitly togged out in selections from the closet of an obnoxious rich guest (played with gusto by Natasha Richardson with an assist from an antic Amy Sedaris as another wealthy hotel visitor). That a highborn hero could fall for such a foxy heroine is understandable Yo shes J. Lo keeping it real with the fans (in a steely manufactured way) by wearing a drab hotel uniform in solidarity with less glamorous actresses. And that Fiennes would want to round out his resume post-""Red Dragon"" by playing a character who isnt a twisted creep is also understandable - at least on the part of the actors agent. But no maid and no fancy lady either would swoon for a fellow as damp as the hero so grudgingly coughed up by Fiennes. In the words of Cinderellas everywhere no effin way.

A project spilling over with odd details -- think Wayne Wang directing George Cukor-style -- this Bronx-meets-Upper East Side tale is played at a sober adult tone that generally resists farcical excess. The fantasies of Cinderella and the American dream are joined and buffed up for unsure romantic results in ""Maid in Manhattan."" A project spilling over with odd details -- from Wayne Wang directing George Cukor-style to Ralph Fiennes GOP senatorial candidates concern for the working poor and the environment -- this Bronx-meets-Upper East Side tale is played at a sober adult tone that generally resists farcical excess. Pic reps a trend along with ""8 Mile"" and ""Real Women Have Curves"" of respectfully depicting working-class folk while obeying the Horatio Alger-like storytelling dictum that they aspire to and realize success. Jennifer Lopez revels in the star role and though her connection with Fiennes is hardly magnetic its enough to ensure a strong opening weekend before the upcoming onslaught of the Oscar contenders. Even more than his misbegotten ""Anywhere but Here"" Wangs ""Maid"" displays the once thoroughly indie-oriented helmer at his most faithful to glossy Hollywood movie-making. The step into conventionality is truly dizzying following the openly erotic ""The Center of the World"" thus marking an even starker shift of styles and tones than when Wang made ""Anywhere"" after the more personal ""Chinese Box."" Kevin Wades script (based on Edmond Dantes story) begins in the Bronx as divorced mom Marisa (Lopez) accompanies her intelligent son Ty (Tyler Garcia Posey) to school to hear him deliver a speech on one of his favorite if extremely unlikely subjects -- Richard Nixon. Marisas ex flakes out on his promise to attend Tys speech and take him camping so Marisa and her mom Veronica (Priscilla Lopez) are left to watch the boy flub his Nixon talk and slink off the podium. Marisa consoles him establishing a genuine mother-son relationship that serves the movie well down the road. Reading ""The Drama of the Gifted Child"" on the bus Marisa arrives at the exclusive Plaza-like Beresford Hotel where she works as a maid under the fair-minded leadership of Paula Burns (Frances Conroy) and chief butler Lionel Bloch (Bob Hoskins). Marisas pal fellow maid Stephanie (Marissa Matrone) cajoles Marisa into trying on a Dolce amp; Gabbana outfit on loan to snooty hotel guest Caroline Lane (Natasha Richardson). The catchphrase for Beresfords staff is the Orwellian ""Strive to be invisible"" yet after bachelor and Senate hopeful Chris Marshall (Fiennes) -- ensconced in a suite with his campaign staff headed by ultra-protective handler Jerry Siegel (Stanley Tucci) -- ends up seeing Marisa in the Dolce amp; Gabbana shes all too conspicuous. Smitten and assuming shes Caroline (with Marisa deliberately avoiding the truth of her identity) Chris takes her and Ty out for a walk in Central Park with his Weimaraner pooch Rufus. Already there are enough elements here to give viewers an overdose of the cutes but Wang sensibly tones everything down. Chris interaction with Ty for example is one of a liberal Republican candidate taken with a kids political interest. The sojourn in Central Park a 15-minute idyll that feels like an update of ""Barefoot in the Park"" is only let down as is the rest of the movie by the absence of the needed spark of truly witty dialogue. For all the pressure that his character feels from intrusive tabloid press and the Senate candidacy and even though he never quite clicks with Lopez Fiennes hasnt looked so relaxed on screen since moments in ""The English Patient."" Lopez -- whose character must continue to be attractive to Chris while concealing her vocation from him -- manages quite well in this type of drama inside a comedy. Pic however gets into trouble when it reaches for laughs. Silliness involving Richardsons hopelessly spoiled airhead who Chris ends up mistakenly inviting over for lunch at which Marisa is a servant and who is the trigger for other theoretically amusing complications is a painful viewing experience. So is the sight of Marisas clownish fellow maids bopping around but this at least is kept thankfully brief. In the end ""Maid"" is about a working gals dream of moving up. Marisas clash with her mom over refusing to settle for blue-collar mediocrity echoes the same sentiment as ""Real Women"" but unlike that hopeful but less romantic indie pic this romance has Marisa destined to embrace Chris by the final reel regardless of how little sense it actually makes. Casts supporting staff is a study in contrasts -- on one side the overacting of Richardson as Caroline and Amy Sedaris as her equally snotty friend; on the other the ingenious Hoskins true to his character staying in the background until his big exit speech and Tucci delivering his banter with the timing of an ace musician. Poseys gifted child feels real rather than precious while Matrone and Priscilla Lopez handily rep varying shades of working-class identity. Pics look is pure widescreen glossiness in the Cukor manner full of sunny hotel interiors and floating copter shots of a post-9/11 Gotham.
