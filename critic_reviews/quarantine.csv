Director John Erick Dowdle and his brother/co-writer Drew cut their teeth on The Poughkeepsie Tapes a Blair Witch-style mock-documentary based on the found video recordings of a serial killer. Yet their calamitous take on the real-time shaky-cam terror of  [Rec] - filmed on studio sets rather than a real apartment block - feels false and flat. The hyperventilating Jennifer Carpenter so credible in The Exorcism of Emily Rose is hopelessly miscast as rookie TV reporter Angela Vidal who joins a fire-fighting team on a routine call-out then finds herself trapped inside a quarantined building with her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) and some very frightened residents. A distressed old lady bites one of the fire-fighters all hell breaks loose and suddenly the place is sealed off by troops in contamination suits. Quarantine then replaces the relentless nerve-shredding terror of [Rec] with headless-chicken hysteria.

THE WORST FILM EVERRRRFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 2 2010filmraterFeaturedThe film was great. Most people who dont like it have poor taste and expect to actually be scared while watching it. Well the truth is that people who arent scared are not scared for a reason. The reason being their overexposure to violence and the like. They arent scared because they are conditioned to blood and violence. There are parts to laugh and there are parts to be scared and that falls into real life. In real life people dont shit their pants when they see someone that is ill. In real life people laugh from time to time. This is the first movie Ive seen where the lead actress seemed like she was terrified. The levels of fear throughout the film were very good. 5stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 2 2010filmraterFeaturedThe film was great.

The plot mostly stacks up if you discount the general twerpishness of the characters - although there were one or two points about the liberty of the individual vs the inststent demands of the state in the face or terror (the cop getting the tenants to stay together downstairs vs the tenant who wanted to hope-up in his own apartment). however it soons descends into a moronic slashem and bashem with an inexplicable and vile ending that negates its previous attempts at presenting any valid metaphor for 21st C western society facing external unknowable threats...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 6 2009Worst Horror Movie EverFeaturedThis movie is so bad as a horror movie. There is no way this movie is anywhere close to Cloverfield. Characters are all so dumb. The reason one of the guy grabbed a hammer was so he could run with it and some time afterward the hammer was gone/dropped. ""Hey lets run around the building with bare hands there is no need for weapon the people outside are so peaceful."" There are ten thousand objects that could be used as weapons for self-defense. This movie makes me want to slap some sense into every character.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 20 2009RoxFeaturedWould the people who slag this movie can just rent a bit of brain next time my first language is Italian so..sorry about the mistake i am 40 and had watched horror all my life from the Japanese horror to the Italian (Dario Argento if you know about horror you know who he is) to the american and the original Spanish REC here remade as Quarantine and i am telling you for a horror is a kick ass Jennifer Carpenter is brilliant and hysterical as the original reporter in the Spanish version was. is a horror reality Blair witch project type and with all the horror garbage around this is solid one and if you dont get it next time go and watch some action/drama whatever dont came and piss me off by slagging this brilliant horror capisce?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 20 2009RoxFeaturedWould the people who slag this movie can just rent a bit of brain next time my first language is Italian so..sorry about the mistake i am 40 and had watched horror all my life from the Japanese horror to the Italian (Dario Argento if you know about horror you know who he is) to the american and the original Spanish REC here remade as Quarantine and i am telling you for a horror is a kick ass Jennifer Carpenter is brilliant and hysterical as the original reporter in the Spanish version was. is a horror reality Blair witch project type and with all the horror garbage around this is solid one and if you dont get it next time go and watch some action/drama whatever dont came and piss me off by slagging this brilliant horror capisce?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 14 2009jaosnFeaturedPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not watch this film i have just pooped my self its sooo scary my girlfriend is crying.....WITH LAUGHTER.

There was no suspense at all Just people screaming all the time and quite honestly ... I want scared It is supposed to have been filmed by a fictous cameraman ... THEN WHY WONT THE CAMERA STOP SHAKING? Even when they standing still I wanted to scream at the screen ""KEEP YOUR HANDS STILL FOR CHRISTS SAKE"" But the worst thing possible was that they showed the ENDING in the trailer AND the poster HOW STUPID IS HOLLYWOOD THESE DAYS? The horrible acting was way over the top and dint help this film any further. DEFINATELY watch ""[REC]"" instead which gave me nightmares for days and left me panting sweating and clutching my heart at the end.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 22 2008CalumFeaturedI saw Quarantine last night and it was pretty bad.

The trailer we saw for Quarantine looks exactly the same as the spanish original version to the letter using exactly the same scenes just avoiding the need for subttles. I am an avid horror fan and few things make me squirm but Rec had me hiding behind a cushion I only hope Quarantine does Rec some justice and a remake of an amazing film just to avoid subtitles is a hame I hope Quarantine lives up to the amazing precident set by Rec.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 14 2008watchmoviesfreeFeaturedhi lads you can watch the full movie online free  watchmoviesfree .ccFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 14 2008watchmoviesfreeFeaturedhi lads you can watch the full movie online free  watchmoviesfree .ccFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 13 2008chicken legFeaturedthem lot are right i thought itd be cool but it was so awful me and my boyfriend left earlyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 11 2008AlexFeaturedjust got back from seeing it.

I didnt know it was going to be a hand-held camera movie but to my surprise I didnt get motion sickness. A lot of the scares in this movie are horribly cliche - you see it coming a mile away. However the main actress does a ridiculously good job at looking insanely terrified.. too terrified and shocked a lot of the times. There were a lot of off the wall comic relief that the entire theatre would be in synchronized laughter. This was a decent horror movie I liked the idea but ""biological warfare"" and ""quarantines"" arent very original. A lot of scenes are in the dark and theres a lot of rapid movement. Id recommend seeing this once although a lot of people in the audience said it wasnt worth the money. I personally loved the Red Faction-esque sledgehammer action but that just added more laughs to the movie rather than chills.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 11 2008JohnFeaturedWorst movie ever doesnt make sense people acting over the top irrational.

Wednesday October 15 2008 at 557 p.m. By LA Weekly 1 Sex Drive A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - CHOOSE CONNOR Pimply Owen Norris (Alex Linz) thinks his life is about to begin when he lands a summer job as the youth campaign spokesman for Senator Connor (Steven Weber). Its not difficult to guess where this is going The idealistic 15-year-old gets sick after his debut political soiree foreshadowing the wretchedness in store for him. At least writer/director Luke Eberl grants Choose Connor a little texture by weaving in some unexpected details with the generic cliches. Our possibly closeted teenage protagonist becomes fast friends with the congressmans gay nephew (Escher Holloway) and the developing relationship plays out with an awkward sweetness at odds with the otherwise grimy proceedings. The narrative also (inadvertently) parallels the current campaign season as Senator Connor jumps in to answer on Owens behalf during his first photo-op -- calling to mind John McCains damage-control chaperoning of Sarah Palin. But for all the potential of this coming-of-age/political-awakening tale Choose Connor undoes itself with an egregiously sordid turn. Arent politics depraved enough without the filmmaker resorting to a sex scandal that rivals that of the Catholic Church? Like this election cycle the movie leaves you cynical and weary. Weve seen it all before. (Sunset 5) (Kristi Mitsuda) GO  CITY OF EMBER The struggle at the center of City of Ember another treat from the maker of Monster House is one for the good of all mankind. But what were the denizens of this world running from when they first trekked underground? Two hundred years after their mucky netherworlds inception the ever-hiccupping generator that keeps the lights on in Ember threatens to go forever kaput. Its up to Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) and Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) to decipher the clues left inside a mysterious box and usher their people -- like Obama or Moses take your pick -- toward deliverance. Back story and motivation are almost nil here but director Gil Kenan reveres the abstract tenor of Jeanne DuPraus acclaimed childrens book understanding the postapocalyptic story as an allegory for the determination of humanity against the forces of darkness -- whatever or whoever they may be. Its look suggests a twee City of Lost Children but Kenan isnt hung up on style alone equally and voluptuously reveling in artifice and the courageous will of Ronan and Treadaways hopeful foot soldiers. The story subtly evokes Rand and scripture colliding secular and spiritual values and as such appeals to the blue- and red-minded alike. (Citywide) (Ed Gonzalez) FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL Tinkering with his image in a way most 007s dont consider until theyve washed their hands of the Bond biz Daniel Craig assumes the moderately unflattering role of Joe Scot a faded movie star floundering in a sea of joyless sex and drugs. Craigs shaken-but-not-stirred charisma makes the most of an underwritten part but the movie nearly flat-lines when the actors not onscreen which is often. The eponymous stroll down memory lane which consumes nearly half the running time replaces Craig with Harry Eden as a 15-year-old Scot growing up in a quaint English village bathed in the golden glow lazy movies use to evoke time regained. Young Joe goes through predictable rites of passage mooning over a glam-rock-loving nymphet (Felicity Jones) and discovering the joys and terrors of sex with a reliably horny housewife (Jodhi May). Writer-director Baillie Walsh works overtime milking Freud and brimstone from the proceedings but the compulsive sexuality that supposedly fills the air is lost in a profusion of stodgy coming-of-age tropes treacly strings and characters that never transcend one-word descriptions like ""sassy"" or ""crotchety."" And when a grown-up Joe finally revisits his old stomping grounds to tie up loose ends you can be sure he wont really be going home again. (Music Hall) (Lance Goldenberg) MATTIE FRESNO AND THE HOLOFLUX UNIVERSE ""Define distracted"" petty criminal Al Lewis (Ellen Cleghorne) asks murder suspect Mattie Fresno (Angela Pierce) early on in Mattie Fresno and the Holoflux Universe and even in a story as unwieldily metafictional as this it probably wouldnt do to have Mattie name her own movie. But you get the point -- distraction and diffuseness not the proffered ""unified theory of what is"" are the thematic and aesthetic core of director Phil Gallos failed political satire/media roasting/New Age fantasy. One could describe Mattie Fresno as being ""about"" the title characters involvement in a convoluted assassination scheme or ""about"" her physicist grandfathers self-created alternate universe but to do so would imply that the movie hangs together more coherently than the average YouTube video. Too bad because the assassination plot conceived by a public-relations firm to win the publics eternal sympathy for a struggling client briefly sustains a welcome rabid cynicism about the politico-media complex ""spin doctors"" megalomaniacal TV personalities fake holy men and an American public that laps it all up like a pig at the trough. Unfortunately Mattie Fresno blunts these sharp satirical edges with moments of aimless screwball comedy awkwardly composed flashbacks and green-screened dream sequences suggestive of anything but the universes deepest complexities. Rarely has a film killed off its own best instincts with more vigor. (Grande 4-Plex) (Matt Brennan) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm MAX PAYNE If Oscars were handed out for fake snow director John Moores bleary dreary sub-Sin City big-screen video game would clean up like Ben-Hur by the 50th exterior shot strewn with fistfuls of art-directed dandruff a viewer stuck in this film-noir snow globe feels like W.C. Fields in ""The Fatal Glass of Beer."" Trudging sullenly through Moores winter wonderland is avenging lawman Mark Wahlberg tracking the syndicate responsible for his familys murder. The role requires Wahlberg to run the gamut of emotions from A to A as he opens doors glowers assembles guns glowers points guns glowers -- and for a big finish glowers. (Even if he endows Max Payne with min brayne the actor still comes off better than Mila Kunis a vengeful assassin by way of a Macys makeup counter or Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges who plays bad-ass Lieutenant Bravura as if his name were Rookie Nondescript.) At least the summers dunderheaded Wanted indulged its thrill-junkie jones for destruction without shame Apart from one cool effects shot of a dragon-winged demon whisking a thug from a high-rise window -- youve seen it in the trailer -- and a constructivist fistfight rendered in comic-book panels of discrete motion this joyless humorless third-person-shooter cheats even on its modest promise of mindless mayhem. The only moment that even mildly ruffles the harbinger-of-doom PG-13 rating belongs to future Bond girl Olga Kurylenko who peels off her dress with NC-17 aplomb -- then vanishes from the movie proving more adept than anyone else involved at dodging a bullet. (Citywide) (Jim Ridley) MORNING LIGHT Two unnerving phenomena -- the popularity of reality-TV competitions and the Walt Disney Companys ability to churn out entertainment starring the most squeaky-clean humans on Earth -- come together in this nightmarishly upbeat documentary about a group of young people who face off with the worlds best sailors in a 2500-mile boat race from Long Beach to Hawaii. Under the watchful eye of Disney exec Roy E. Disney 15 hand-selected college-age seafarers train for the annual Transpacific Yacht Race eventually deciding among themselves who will make up the final crew of 11. The movies first half consists of typical Americas Next Top Model-type rigmarole where were forced to hear every contestants back story -- although here no ones a closet lesbian or anorexic. Once the crew is selected things improve somewhat as director Mark Monroe shifts his attention to the race treating the audience to one gorgeous panoramic shot of the Pacific Ocean after another. But no matter how many times these young adults insist that this grueling competition is changing their lives Morning Light strenuously ignores the obvious emotional and physical toll playing up the gosh-darn fun factor until the participants feel like cogs in the films inspiration machine. These kids survive their adventure on the high seas but escaping the powerful Disney agenda is another matter entirely. (Selected theaters) (Tim Grierson) PATTI SMITH DREAM OF LIFE If Patti Smiths narration to Dream of Life was simplified into a stanza it might go something like this As long as I can remember I sought to be free/Bob Dylan once tuned this guitar for me/My mission is to give people my energy/Fred Jesse and Jackson are my family tree/New generations rise up rise up take to the streets/Me and Flea talking about pee. Her much more long-winded monologues are just as randomly assembled in the documentary 109 mostly black-and-white minutes of punks wet nurse floating through the modern world while endlessly ruminating on mortality art and the occasional bodily function. Problem is theres nary a hint of context even with biographic essentials When Patti sprinkles the ashes of ""Robert"" onto her palm were momentarily left to guess thats Mapplethorpe; when she and erstwhile paramour Sam Shepard are acoustically jamming and their respective tattoos come up the playwright muses ""That was a weird night at the Chelsea."" More please? Blame first-time director Steven Sebring the fashion photographer whom the ""very private"" Patti entrusted to film her for 11 years and who says in regard to Dream of Life ""I want to turn people on to Patti Smith."" If the resulting movie had been comprehensible to anyone besides those who have an armpit-hair fetish thanks to Easter he mightve stood a chance. (Nuart) (Camille Dodero) GO  QUARANTINE The megaplex boneyard is littered with inferior U.S. remakes of superior overseas horror films and their existence is even more galling when they keep the originals from getting domestic distribution. Its a shame that this English-language cover of an excellent Spanish shocker will eclipse the original at least in U.S. theaters -- but even those who despise remakes will have to admit that director John Erick Dowdles furious retread is scary as hell. (Unless that is theyve seen the idiot trailer which gives away the entire damn movie.) Practically a scene-for-scene re-creation the U.S. version retains the setting -- an apartment building under siege by zombie contagion -- as well as the gimmick The movie unfolds in on-the-spot news footage shot by the crew penned up inside. Far more convincing than Cloverfield or Diary of the Dead in its fake-found-footage ambience Quarantine wisely spends its first 15 minutes acclimating the audience to its chirpy feature-reporter heroine (Jennifer Carpenter). From there its utterly relentless as the dwindling dwellers lunge through infested corridors in gradually vanishing light. The lack of music the nerve-wracking sound design the suggestive lighting and the unobtrusive cutting combine to keep us off-guard but its the ensemble that evokes bat-shit terror so convincingly. (Citywide) (Jim Ridley)  SAVING MARRIAGE Come November 4 Californians will punch their ballot for or against an amendment to the state constitution titled ""Eliminates Rights of Same-Sex Couples to Marry Act"" (a.k.a. Prop. 8). Thats a harsh name for a measure whose origins can be traced to a 2003 Massachusetts Judicial Court order stating that full marriage rights must be made available to all. Political bedlam ensued prompting an assembly bill which if passed would have been the first step toward writing a gay-marriage ban into the Massachusetts Constitution. In this energetic and unapologetically biased documentary directors Mike Roth and John Henning are there for the first failed statehouse vote and the two-year battle that follows during which queer activists and their hetero sympathizers organize against a second legislative vote on the potential amendment and later still a civil action seeking the same initiative. Amid the turmoil the directors capture the sweet angst of several couples planning their nuptials but what propels Saving Marriage is footage of the campaign to replace an old-school state representative with a gay 25-year-old health care worker -- a political novice whose attempt to change the system from within makes one think that theres hope yet for this democracy thing. (Regent Showcase) (Chuck Wilson) GO  SECRECY Few Americans would argue with Winston Churchills dictum ""In wartime truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies."" But the culture of secrecy that has developed within the Bush/Cheney White House has taken that admonition to dangerous extremes. The inherent tension that exists between the publics right to know and the governments need for confidentiality in the service of national security is the subject of Secrecy a powerful documentary by Harvard professors Peter Galison and Robb Moss. In addition to historical footage the film employs a series of pulsating animated drawings with the white ink against the black background injecting an appropriately unsettling even sinister tone. Arguments on both sides of the debate are presented although the filmmakers have a clear point of view that the current level of secrecy is harmful. Most chilling is the former CIA station chief who defends secrecy on the grounds that it ""allows us the latitude of action to use methods that are not necessarily consistent with our values as a nation."" (Music Hall) (Jean Oppenheimer) THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES From its attention-grabbing B-movie beginning The Secret Life of Bees a family drama based on the best-selling novel by Sue Monk Kidd chugs pleasantly into a television special tailored for the crossover female market while dropping tantalizing hints that it has more on its mind than a benign tale of substitute mothering across the color line. The ever-capable Dakota Fanning plays Lily a motherless teenager who flees her bullying father (Paul Bettany channeling Brad Dourif) to find safe haven with three black beekeeping sisters more solidly equipped for life than she. Writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love amp; Basketball) bathes them in a honeyed glow and tempers the soundtracks jaunty Motown music with a soft guitar when Southern racism pokes in its unwelcome head. Stately black actresses approaching middle age always run the risk of getting locked in as the face of Black Equanimity and as August the oldest sister whose job it is to teach Lily how to live a good life Queen Latifah has no choice but to succumb. Only near the end does this likable but saccharine movie fleetingly complicate the Gone With the Wind-fed delusion that the love of poor black nannies for their white charges was undiluted by bitterness. Is that Hattie McDaniel I hear whooping for joy from beyond the grave? For a longer version of this review go to laweekly.com/movies.(Citywide) (Ella Taylor)  GO  SEX DRIVE Between his unsympathetic family and his demeaning doughnut-shop job the likable but luckless Ian (Josh Zuckerman) is a prototypical teen-movie protagonist with a prototypical teen-movie conflict Hes still a virgin. Naturally a prototypical solution must follow. With his two best friends (played by Amanda Crew and Clark Duke) Ian steals his brothers 1969 Pontiac GTO and embarks on a road trip to hook up with his Internet crush. Heralded by Porkys and perfected by John Hughes the post-pubescent sex comedy is a genre as identifiable as the film noir or the Western and Sex Drive doesnt miss any of the motifs. Sweet muscle car? Check. Terroristic older sibling? Check. (In frosted tips and cut-off sweatshirt James Marsden relishes the role.) Ample amounts of Tamp;A? Check. Yet rather than wink at adults with a knowing rehash of early 80s iconography director and co-writer Sean Anders aims for the only audience that counts the youth of today. Like Superbad Sex Drive maintains its belief that the average modern teenager is funnier and more compelling than the stereotyped hipsters of Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist or the fantastic figurines of High School Musical. Even as Ians journey detours into National Lampoon-like farce the movie remains faithful to a portrait of teens as they see themselves. (Citywide) (Sam Sweet) WHAT JUST HAPPENED? Jaw-droppingly arcane and dripping with self-regard Barry Levinsons tedious excuse for a Hollywood caper asks us as if we havent been asked a thousand times before to pity the poor movie producer -- in this case Art Linson adapting his own memoir about trying to get good movies made in bad old Hollywood. To hear him tell it Linson (nicely played under the radar by Robert De Niro) is just another harmlessly uxorious Everyman trying to win back his former wife (Robin Wright Penn) and daughters while wielding his Bluetooth on the 405 freeway to fend off or placate the assholes divas and neurotics whose mission in life is to thwart his every effort to bring art -- or failing that Sean Penn -- to the masses. Begging for sympathy What Just Happened? invites only schadenfreude. Bruce Willis is very funny as a tantrum-prone star who refuses to shave his scary beard and Catherine Keener is amusingly uptight as a chilly studio head. But though industry insiders may get a good snigger out of seeing thinly disguised acquaintances hung and quartered theres no need to ask how this all-too-aptly titled poorly lit and gratuitously handheld movie -- which never for a moment transcends its narrow milieu -- will play in Peoria. It wont. (The Landmark; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Ella Taylor) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact LA Weekly Follow LA Weekly laweekly L.A.

This isnt the horror we hoped for | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThis isnt the horror we hoped forCreating horror through the prism of found video footage has more resonance today than when the Blair Witch Project debuted almost a decade ago.By Tony WongTelevisionSun. Oct. 12 2008Starring Jennifer Carpenter Jay Hernandez. Directed by John Erick Dowdle. 89 minutes. At major theatres. 18ACreating horror through the prism of found video footage has more resonance today than when the Blair Witch Project debuted almost a decade ago.The landscape has changed dramatically since the backpackers were lost in the woods with only their video camera to be found later including a greater distrust of mainstream media the rise of digital technology and the prominence of YouTube. Article Continued BelowEveryone has the potential to become a would-be journalist and theres nothing more real - or eerie - than grainy cellphone footage of Saddam Hussein being hanged or prisoners being tortured in Abu Ghraib.But theres one drawback to the genre as demonstrated in this years Cloverfield which might explain why Blair Witch didnt have as many imitators as youd expect.For one thing you need to down a box of Gravol with your Twizzlers otherwise youll end up with a whopping migraine. (When I was 10 I used to jiggle my friends Super 8 Camera to get scary effects. It seems things havent changed much over the last three decades in low budget horror.)Thankfully Quarantine has cleverly allowed one of the stars to be a TV camera guy so not every shot will want to make you hurl. Thats a good start.Quarantine is based on the 2007 Spanish thriller [REC]. Like any imitation the qualitys not as good but this is about cheap thrills of which there are not enough. Making reality video creepy is hard when the real news is often scarier. What you can do is create a narrative arc to move beyond the YouTube moment. This is helped by the camera guy who has conveniently decided to keep shooting and films enough B-roll for a three-part Ken Burns documentary. Reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter and The Exorcism of Emily Rose) is doing a boring lifestyle shoot at a fire station when she tags along on a distress call to an apartment building.The buildings inhabitants are apparently infected with some virulent strain of rabies that turns them into raging homicidal zombies.There are a few things every cross-genre fan knows will happen Theres a cute kid who turns into a zombie and the camera guy will not die first. The protagonists will also try to assemble some sort of escape plan but its not clear exactly what theyre doing except running from room to room.Luckily the rabid zombies seem to like bashing their heads against the camera so you can get a good look. Carpenters over-the-top hysterics are a jarring counterpoint to the naturalistic seemingly improvised dialogue and you start hoping she will die first except she might come back to life as an even more annoying and hysterical zombie.Distributors decided not to preview the film to critics figuring that the heavy-rotation trailer of a screaming Carpenter being yanked into a dark hole would make their point. It did for me.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(john bramley/sony pictures) By Michael Hardy Globe Correspondent / October 11 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Quarantine"" begins with television reporter Angela (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) tagging along with a crew of Los Angeles firemen on a 911 call about a mentally disturbed old woman. They arrive at a creepy apartment complex camera rolling only to discover that instead of making a human-interest feature for the 6 oclock news theyve been drafted as filmmakers for a latter-day ""Blair Witch Project."" By the time they realize this of course the Centers for Disease Control has locked everyone inside the building and zombies have begun snacking on the trapped humans.Like ""Blair Witch"" ""Quarantine"" uses the conceit of a movie-within-a-movie to give documentary immediacy to its assorted grotesqueries. This works for the first half of the film when Scott manages to keep the camera relatively level. When the zombies perk up in the second half Scott and the filmmakers seem less interested in holding a steady shot than in conveying that ""you are about to die"" feeling so prized in the horror genre. What the jerky camerawork conveyed to me was ""you are about to throw up"" which I quite nearly did. A ticket to ""Quarantine"" ought to come with a maximum-strength dose of Dramamine.I have seen many execrable films - ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" ""Disaster Movie"" ""Batman amp; Robin"" - but never has a movie made me so physically ill; even now an hour after leaving the theater I can still taste bile in the back of my throat. In its presentation ""Quarantine"" is more akin to a first-person-shooter like ""Halo"" than anything conventionally understood by the word ""cinema"" (although at least you can pause a video game).Yet I suspect director John Erick Dowdle would be pleased at my reaction since the apparent ambition of contemporary horror films is to inflict the greatest possible suffering upon their audience. By this standard ""Quarantine"" easily earns its place in the pantheon. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Quarantine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; quarantine ) Quarantine (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli It has become tiresome to travel to a multiplex seemingly every other Friday to see the latest remake of a foreign horror film. For the most part the problem isnt that these productions are remakes but that theyre bad remakes. In some cases thats because the source material isnt good and in some cases its because something is broken in the translation. The reason the term ""remake"" has developed a negative connotation isnt because the re-imagination of a story in another era or for a different culture is inherently flawed but because so many of them are produced without any concern for intelligence or artistry. Quarantine is an English-language remake of the 2007 Spanish horror film [Rec]. While the films are in many ways similar (with certain shots and passages of dialogue being identical) Quarantine fails to correct some of the problems evident in its predecessor while also incorporating a few defects of its own. The first-person style is an inherent roadblock to Quarantine achieving any degree of mainstream acceptance. Nausea-inducing movies like this rarely work well with audiences even when theres a huge marketing campaign at work (Cloverfield for example). Quarantine is a small movie with a mostly unknown cast and it looks like it was made for next to nothing. The reason for filming a movie in this faux documentary style is to increase the sense of immediacy and bring the viewer into the action. (Its a more popular approach for video games than motion pictures but one wonders whether that may be changing.) Quarantine succeeds at that but the films greatest strength is also its undoing. Intimacy devolves into chaos during the final third when the camera is shaking so badly that its next to impossible to figure out whats going on. As the picture opens TV reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) is preparing to do an in-depth report on what its like to be a firefighter in Los Angeles. Accompanying her is her faithful cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) who is largely heard but not seen. Angela and Scott have been assigned to shadow two of L.A.s finest Jake (Jay Hernandez) and Fletcher (Johnathon Schaech). The first third of Quarantine is relatively sedate as director John Erick Dowdle introduces the characters and sets up the relationships. With its relatively stable cinematography and low-key interaction this part of the movie works reasonably well and Jennifer Carptenters limitations as an actress arent a serious detriment. The middle third of Quarantine places the firefighters and reporters in a decrepit apartment building after they have responded to a 911 call. No sooner are they inside than the authorities on the outside lock and bar the doors. It seems that theres a dangerous contagion on the loose within the building and the CDC cant risk it getting into the outside world. A number of inhabitants have become infected with a mutant strain of rabies that causes them to act like theyre in a George A. Romero movie. In fact Romero has already made a zombie movie using this style so Im wondering why another one is necessary. Any goodwill that Dowdle builds up with his reasonably restrained approach to Quarantines first 60 minutes is discarded as the film rushes headlong toward its climax. The extremity of the cameras shaking and flash-panning didnt make me motion sick (a condition to which I am prone outside of theaters) but it disoriented and annoyed me. Theres nothing I dislike more than having no idea whats going on. Worse still the audio consists primarily of loud noises and the lead actress whimpering. The ending is neither a shock nor a surprise. Not only is the final shot shown in the trailers but its used for the poster image. Talk about spoilers. For those who can put aside the first-person style and the uninspired acting all thats left is a group of people trapped inside a dark building trying to avoid being bitten by zombie-like creatures. To say thats an overly familiar story is to be kind. The first act is supposed to humanize the characters enough so that we feel something when the panic sets in but the documentary approach is distancing. The more the camera shakes and the less coherent the visuals become the less we care about the protagonists. And whats the likelihood a sane cameraman is going to continue filming when circumstances require him to run for his life? All first-person films face this credulity gap but it is glaringly obvious in Quarantine. Based on multiple viewings of each The Blair Witch Project Diary of the Dead and Cloverfield all play better on DVD than in theaters. Theres something about the approach that is more effective on a smaller screen. Maybe the same will be true of Quarantine. Its easily the weakest entry into this ever-expanding category and is inferior to its subtitled source material. Quarantine implies ""stay away"" and thats not bad advice.

"Movie review Quarantine -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Quarantine -- 3 out of 5 stars TV reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman (Steve Harris) are assigned to spend the night shift with a Los Angeles fire station. A 911 call takes them to an apartment building where blood-curdling screams are coming from one of the apartment units. They soon learn that a woman living in the building has been infected by something unknown. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Quarantine is a movie testament to craftsmanship and commitment. The best Blair Witch knockoff of them all is basically a zombie movie seen through the viewfinder of a TV news camera that ""found footage"" Blair Witch Project conceit.But think about what it takes to make that come off -- the camera blocking and staging the choreography that gets our stars and the lights and mikes and camera from one perfect spot to capture whats happening to the next perfect spot with enough jarring jumpy bumps in the Steadicam to make it all so nauseatingly real. And the actors are working in long takes. That means pages of script at a time no lazy short edits to cover blown lines or players dropping out of character. Jennifer Carpenter playing the too-thin too-young too-flirty TV reporter whose ""ride along"" with firemen turns into a zombie virus nightmare gives a performance that harks back to the Golden Age of Jamie Lee Curtis. Yeah shes that good.No the script isnt anything special and the novelty long ago wore off in this style of movie making. But the execution in this film from John Erick Dowdle (he also did the similarly constructed Poughkeepsie Tapes) is amazing the camera work and cutting perfect. Quarantine is a remake of [Rec] a Spanish horror thriller about a reporter and a cameraman who get more than they bargained for when they do a story on the night shift at a fire station. An ambulance call takes them to an old apartment building. An old lady is sick foaming at the mouth and covered in blood. Before they can get her out shes bitten others and the building is instantly sealed off SWAT snipers preventing anybody from leaving. One by one the residents (Greg Germann plays a vet) and the first responders are picked off official reassurances that ""thisll all be over soon"" not being very reassuring at all.The confines of the ancient and darkened building create paranoia the sound effects (sirens and helicopters) add to it.And as Angela Carpenter (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) avoids the shallow vapid TV newsbabe cliches. Shes just a young woman fighting back hysteria by doing her job and yelling ""Film EVERYTHING"" As this lean Masque of the Red Death unfolds she reacts the way most of us would. She hyperventilates.The jerky motion of the camera may make you sick because this sort of horror isnt to every taste. But Quarantine is the first of the Blair Witch clones to rip it off without embarrassing those doing the ripping off.

Predicated on the idea that whiplash pans inconstant focusing and other faux cinema verite embellishments can refresh even the moldiest of zombie-movie tropes ""Quarantine"" is a modestly inventive sporadically exciting thriller that nonetheless proves too faithful to its central conceit for its own good. Based on the 2007 Spanish-produced ""Rec"" the pic sacrifices coherence with its vertiginous approach yet managed to shake out 14.2 million over its opening weekend from those hungry for horror. Whether auds remain under its power is the question. Working from a well-structured script he co-wrote with sibling Drew Dowdle director John Erick Dowdle (""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"") deceptively dawdles over the opening scenes as reality TV reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) ingratiate themselves with their latest subjects firefighters Jake (Jay Hernandez) and Fletcher (Johnathon Schaech). The pace quickens only slightly when a 911 call leads the firefighters and two LAPD officers -- and of course Angela and Scott -- to a small downtown apartment building where an elderly resident is found covered in blood and breathing erratically. Unfortunately shes not nearly as fragile as she appears Without warning she attacks one of the cops ripping away a huge hunk of the poor guys throat with her teeth. A bad situation soon worsens as the luckless folks inside the building find the complex has been sealed off by the Center for Disease Control and various heavily armed military types as whoever turned the old woman into a flesh-eating marauder is highly contagious. Ratcheting up the suspense helmer Dowdle unfolds the action more or less in real time while presenting everything from the p.o.v. of Scott -- or more specifically his video camera. (Think ""Cloverfield"" writ small.) ""Quarantine"" relies heavily on shadowy atmospherics and cheap-but-effective shocks while the infection slowly but surely decreases the number of non-zombies in the building. Fortunately the bogeymen can be pounded into submission or killed with blunt instruments. Pics highlight is a shocking hilarious scene in which a zombie is beaten to a bloody pulp with the omniscient video camera. Unfortunately Dowdle goes overboard with the fake-reality-TV excess dashing the camera hither and yon so frenetically that its difficult if not impossible to keep track of whos where and how individual characters might be interconnected emotionally or spatially. By the time Angela is flailing about in the darkness of an attic lab her frenzied gestures may produce giggles not shivers from a sensory-overloaded aud. Even so perfs are credible across the board. Harris gets minimal screen time but still manages to limn a compelling character. And considering the limitations imposed by the storytelling gimmick pics ending -- not unlike the finale of ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- is surprisingly satisfying. (It might have been even more impressive had it not been excerpted in the theatrical trailer.) Credit d.p.
