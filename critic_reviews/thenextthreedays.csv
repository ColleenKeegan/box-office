The Next Three Days Bad to fair Director Paul Haggis. Cast Russell Crowe Elizabeth Banks Olivia Wilde. Rating PG-13 for violence drug material language some sexuality and thematic elements. Spotlight Russell Crowe 5 best Russell Crowe performances Absolutely. Not everyone who watches reality TV can be an idiot after all. But in ""The Next Three Days"" Paul Haggis film about a man (Russell Crowe) who essentially jettisons his life to free his wife (Elizabeth Banks) convicted of murder from prison requires such a long detailed setup that its impossible not to think that at some point the guy would come to his senses. Yes hes driven mad by grief and anger more or less unhinged but when you get to the place where youre using YouTube to learn how to break into cars perhaps youve gone too far. Or in this case not far enough. The opening scene with John Brennan (Crowe) driving through the Pittsburgh night with the muffled groans of a man in the trunk is a tip-off in that direction. John and Lara (Banks) live a seemingly happy life though Lara is frustrated at work as she makes plain at dinner with John and friends. And then the next day police burst into their home and arrest Lara for her boss murder. She claims innocence and flashbacks dont make clear who committed the crime. There is however plenty of evidence against her including the victims blood on Laras coat. Soon shes sentenced to 20 years in prison leaving John to raise their son Luke (Ty Simpkins). Lara doesnt adjust well to prison life something that Haggis first portrays with flat dirty hair and no makeup for the otherwise beautiful Banks and then with more dire developments. John an English teacher at a community college becomes obsessed with getting her out of prison at any cost. When legal methods fail well what other methods are there? A scheduled transfer eventually will force his hand. Its easy to imagine that someone in Johns situation might daydream about breaking his wife out. Its also easy to imagine tentative steps toward looking into it - a few Internet queries to pass the time whatever. But even with an actor of Crowes skill its hard to believe the mild thoughtful John would take to the mean streets of Pittsburgh for fake IDs blast his way into drug houses and such. It is however a welcome occurrence when he meets with Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson) who has escaped from prison many times and written a book about it. Their scene together in a bar casts Neeson in the role of grizzled tough guy and Crowe as a neophyte in over his head and its the best bit in the film. Breaking out is tough Pennington says. Staying out is tougher because you have to be willing to let everything go. Of course thats not a problem for John who pretty much already has. There are some things to admire in the film based on the French movie ""Pour Elle"" most of which involve developments that would give too much away. But there are things to dislike as well which also would reveal too much to discuss. Ultimately the usually solid Haggis (""In the Valley of Elah"" ""Crash"") and Crowe dont show us enough of Johns descent into desperation. He just sort of arrives there with madness fully formed. If we are to believe that hes mired in such a state it would have helped to see a little more of the trip that got him there. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

The plot - Russell Crowes browbeaten family man finds his life falling apart when his wife (Elizabeth Banks) is convicted of murder and decides to bust her out - promises high-stakes drama and high-octane action so its a shame that it takes The Next Three Days well over an hour to get going. When it does the film is gripping intense and highly enjoyable. But its a long tough slog to get there.It doesnt help that Haggis has chosen to set the film in the wintry industrial wasteland of Pittsburgh restricting his palette to concrete grey and muddy brown. He reins in his actors to a frustrating degree what should feel like tight-lipped realism comes off as merely half-hearted leaving some early scenes - such as one in which Crowe meets multiple escapee Liam Neeson for coffee and deep research - feeling flat and perfunctory. But in the third act both Haggis and his actors kick it into high gear leading to a breathless chase sequence the outcome of which is unpredictable to the last moments. We know Haggis is a filmmaker who takes his craft terribly seriously. But in The Next Three Days a sense of portentous joylessness cripples what could have been a satisfying genre thriller.

HisRobin Hood film was flatulent and this thriller was missing actors like Ice T and Michael Madsen (although Liam Neeson pops up for a joke)... I never got to see the orignal film from 2008 but how that can have a better plot is beyond me... The whole thing hung on characters you cared about and the two leads were entirely unsympathetic... The whole thing with the cops and the button was corny... I was expecting a good rounded thriller like RANSOM but was far from impressed with a plot that hung on som much coincidence and plot stretches. In a film like UNKNOWN or TAKEN you half expect the stupidity and go along for the ride. Suspended disbelief is standard... Next Three Days pretends to have a weight and gravity with the presence of Russell Crowe and write director Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby / Crash / In The Valley Of Elah).. The whole thing is as thrilling as 10yrs of the Queens Speech on Christmas Day...

I guess that this film was commissioned so quickly after AFH is a compliment to the original story but something gets lost in translation.

The way in which the police suddenly started taking an interest in Crowe with no reason to do so and the sudden ratcheting up to maximum tension just because his jailed wife owned a car of the same type as one used in a drugs murder didnt ring true to me. (Not that I found some of Crowes actions very believable either) Overall I thought the pacing too slow and the plot holes could have been overlooked if the director had restricted himself to a 90 minute film and kept the story moving at a fast and rhythmic pace.

I found it original absorbing and totally plausible with its ` ordinary man` in `extraordinary circumstances` story-line. Russell Crowes quirky performance is rivetting and the director Paul Haggis handles the suspense skilfully so that the audience is never quite sure what is happening and nothing seems predictable. The slow-moving realism of the first half of the film is essential to justify the second half of the film which will keep you on the edge of your seat with some terrific action scenes. Theres a very impressive music score as well . . . But where this film really earns its five-star rating is its delineation of a complex moral and emotional dilemma which is superbly realized by Russell Crowe whose is completely convincing as a man torn between adherence to societys moral imperatives and an instinctive sense of natural justice fuelled by an emotional bias based on the characters love for his immediate family.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 19 2010 Save for later Saved Liam Neeson (l.) and Russell Crowe are shown in a scene from The Next Three Days. Phil Caruso/Lionsgate/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of With most movie thrillers implausibility comes with the territory. ""The Next Three Days"" takes that territory into uncharted terrain. Suspension of disbelief rapidly gives way to ""Oh puhleeze.""Russell Crowe in one of his wily sodden renditions plays John Brennan a Pittsburgh literature professor whose wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) shortly after the films halcyon opening is imprisoned for supposedly killing her boss. With a young son to take care of John spends the next three years trying to prove Laras innocence only to realize that the chances of reopening her case are nil. So John does what any good husband would do He decides to spring her from prison.This isnt a bad premise for a thriller and it even has a psychological angle thats potentially intriguing - in trying to rescue his wife John transforms himself into the sort of cold-blooded avenger she could never love. (The source material is a 2008 cult French thriller ""Anything For Her"" that ran a full half hour less than this films unnecessarily long 133 minutes.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Writer-director Paul Haggis (""Crash"") stumbles early on. The flashbacks replaying the bosss murder are so ineptly staged that its difficult to know if we are meant to be confused - or is it Haggis whos confused? The biggest problem is Johns unconvincing transformation into a kind of rumply ninja. Early on he gives a lecture to his students on ""Don Quixote"" and I guess this is meant to explain his quixotic quest to save Lara. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? But theres a big difference between fantasy and reality even if youre a college professor. (Couldnt Haggis at least have made him an ex-Navy SEAL with a hankering for the classics?) According to this films logic you are what you teach. I suppose we should be glad John wasnt lecturing on ""Crime and Punishment.""John picks up his jail-break skills mainly through the Internet. (Dont try this at home.) He also has a quick confab with an ex-con (a dour Liam Neeson) who warns him that the hard part isnt the escape but the aftermath when the hunt is on.The hunt should have come a lot sooner. Until the time when Johns plan goes into hyperdrive ""The Next Three Days"" is all buildup. In its final half-hour all the stops are pulled. The movie is still wildly implausible but at least its hurtling forward. The only thing missing from the proceedings is a windmill for John to tilt at. Or maybe I missed it. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for violence drug material language some sexuality and thematic elements.)-----More Monitor movie reviews Recent Movie Reviews Star Trek Beyond is consistently entertaining Norman Lear Just Another Version of You is a testimonial to an icon The Innocents The subject of the film is more arresting than the movie Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads About these ads We want to hear did we miss an angle we should have covered?

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Next Three Days amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Unstoppable Tangled >> The Next Three Days Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks play a pair of in-love parents who have their bucolic Prius-owning marriage upended after Banks is arrested and convicted of murdering her boss. To the prosecution its an airtight case several witnesses saw them arguing just hours before the murder and Banks fingerprints are on the weapon and the victims blood is spattered on her trench coat. Everyone thinks shes guilty--they just wont admit it to Crowe who sets about trying to appeal her sentence with the passion of Joan of Arc. And when he runs out of higher courts he turns to Liam Neeson as a jailbird Houdini who knows all the tricks. (Though sadly Neesons only got one scene before he escapes from the movie too.) Crowes got a brainy glower and a bulky clumsy menace that writer-director Paul Haggis plays up as the bourgeois husband schemes and slums to put together his best-possible plan. And Haggis knows that the question isnt only can he do it but should he? Hes believable as a school teacher driven to obsession even if the age gap between him and Banks keeps us from buying their hot romance. Banks is given less to work with; her character flips from Donna Reed to depressed inmate without making us believe in the woman in between. Shes got the menace but isnt given the depth--instead she comes across like a Southern beauty queen who would swap her competitions face cream with fake tanner. But Haggis has done well at setting up the stakes and the structure of a breakout--theyve got just 35 minutes to flee the city before roadblocks lock them down--and when the clock starts ticking were on the edge of our seats.

(Phil Caruso) Joe Neumaier Friday November 19 2010 400 AM Title A Pennsylvania teacher turns to crime to free his wife from prison. With Russell Crowe Elizabeth Banks. Director Paul Haggis (202). PG-13 Language violence. At area theaters.A preposterous movie can sometimes be its own reward. If its done well it can easily dodge huge lapses in logic as long as things connect.But ""The Next Three Days"" a domestic melodrama combined with a prison-escape thriller isnt so lucky. Its laughably eye-rollingly absurd so you dont watch it and wonder ""Hey why not?"" You endure it and wonder ""So ... why did they do that?""If it didnt star Russell Crowe whose watchability has increased as his forehead gets more furrowed ""The Next Three Days"" would resemble a no-name cable movie you zone in and out of while channel-surfing First one extreme thing happens then another and you check in just to see how ludicrous it gets. As writer-director Paul Haggis film lumbers along nothing feels real although everything is presented in the same deadly serious tone.Crowe plays John Brennan a Pittsburgh community college teacher whose life is upended one morning when his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for the murder of her awful boss. The night before Lara was ranting about how much she hated the soon-to-be-dead woman so its tough to explain away the blood on her coat and her fingerprints at the scene.But John raising their young son alone hopes to win Lara an appeal even after three years. When her attorney tells him its hopeless John devises a plan to bust Lara out himself. He asks a repeat escapee (Liam Neeson) for tips andmeticulously maps out his strategy. He then finds out Lara is set to be transferred to another prison in three days so he has to move fast.In his remake of a French thriller Haggis (""Crash"" the scripts for ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Casino Royale"") cruises past some things while overemphasizing others. For instance average-guy John doesnt know how to load bullets into the gun he bought but we see him blowing away drug dealers to steal cash. He apparently spends months learning how to pick car locks timing the arrival of delivery trucks and copying the diabetic Laras medical documents. Then most of his final scheme depends on chance.Yet the biggest missing piece is Neesons character a potentially fascinating mentor-in-crime whos jettisoned after only one scene; instead Haggis introduces some stereotypically hard-bitten detectives.Crowes bullish dynamism and intensity barely pull things up to B-movie quality. The Oscar-winning actor needs an escape plan in his contract for exactly this kind of project.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 19 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 311PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English An okay thriller with lots of smart flourishes The Next Three Days has us hooked early on but never quite gets us in the boat. Writer-director Paul Haggis stares into but fails to find an intriguing character in his monolithic leading man. Its sometimes hard for filmmakers to drive star vehicles. William Goldman complained that writing All the Presidents Men was difficult because Robert Redford commissioned vanity scenes. An attractive girlfriend showing up here. A big speech there. Movies The Next Three Days The official trailer Perhaps thats what happened with The Next Three Days. Haggis directed the film but star Russell Crowe called the shots. The film gets off to a terrific start. Crowes character John is an English teacher a likeable ironic guy. Not ambitious. Living in Pittsburgh and working at a community college is exactly his speed. We meet him at a restaurant with wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks). Shes just had a row with her boss. Now shes fighting her sister-in-law. John sits back and smiles. Crowe isnt supposed to be a gladiator this time out. Hes an amused spectator. His wife is the one with the broadsword. Next day at breakfast John is cuddling his boy Luke making fun of Moms temper when the police burst in arresting Lara for murder. Its a great opening with a better set up than the 2007 film Pour Elle upon which The Next Three Days is based. As in the French film our bookish teacher is forced to learn a new trade jail breaker. To save his family John has to figure out how to pull off a prison break from the outside. Unfortunately what should be a compelling character study falls apart a few scenes later when that character the lost middle-aged spectator disappears. John shows up at a park with Luke and a spectacular Bond-type girl a divorcee with a child lights up upon seeing him. Hes acting like hes Russell Crowe. For The Next Three Days to work we have to wonder if a lost wounded academic can become an action hero. There should be a scene where the teacher hurries into a phone booth becoming Superman. But that never happens. Ten minutes into the movie three beautiful women have already come on to John - his sister-in-law wife and the Bond girl. Middle-age dislocation shouldnt be this much fun. So were not that surprised when John swings into an efficient fighting machine disarming bad guys and evading the authorities. Crowe even wears action-hero stubble throughout. The film also could have made more of Elizabeth Banks. At one point we believe shes the reincarnation of Barbara Stanwyck - a scheming forties femme fatale. What fun the movie might have been if Lara played John for a chump. Like Stanwyck set up Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity. If Paul Haggis fails to work magic with his leads he does a lot of other things right. The jailbreak attempt is well orchestrated and suitably tense. And as he demonstrated in Crash the Canadian filmmaker is good at moving minor characters around. The criminal element including jailbreak expert Liam Neeson and the cops on Johns trail are convincing and fun to watch. Canadian audiences will also appreciate Haggiss jab at a national punching bag. A character is asked by an Air Canada ticket-taker why he isnt taking any baggage on an international flight. Thinking quickly he responds ""How many times have you lost my baggage?"" At which point the Air Canada official sheepishly sends him through.

Comments The Next Three Days Recommended Rated PG-13  122 minutes  2010 A Pittsburgh college professor (Russell Crowe) reels as his wife (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested tried and convicted of having murdered her boss; when the appeals process is exhausted the devoted husband hatches a scheme to spring her from the massive Allegheny County Jail so they can flee to South America with their young son. Remaking an 84-minute French thriller Pour Elle writer-director Paul Haggis (Crash In the Valley of Elah) stretches the action to more than two hours tracking the husbands arduous self-tutorial in prison security and his rocky moral journey as he learns to function in the underworld. Yet the characters are so vivid that the suspense never lags. Crowe is best in buttoned-down roles like this one and he holds the husbands fear and resolve in balance; Banks best known as a comedy love interest gives a striking performance as the increasingly unhinged wife who may or may not be guilty.

The Next Three Days Busting into jail one heartbeat at a time | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Next Three Days Busting into jail one heartbeat at a timePaul Haggis gets us so engrossed watching the gears slowly mesh in his prison-break drama The Next Three Days slowly mesh together its disconcerting when a rote thriller erupts.Elizabeth Banks and Russell Crowe star in The Next Three Days.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 18 2010 The Next Three Days (out of 4) Starring Russell Crowe Elizabeth Banks Liam Neeson and Brian Dennehy. Written and directed by Paul Haggis. At major theatres. 133 minutes. 14A Paul Haggis gets us so engrossed watching the gears slowly mesh in his prison-break drama The Next Three Days its disconcerting when the machine finally clanks noisily into action. For the most part its a film of measured pace and careful reveals not unlike Anton Corbijns recent The American in which George Clooney played a master weapons builder meticulously crafting a weapon for a vaguely defined illicit job. The payoff was in the polishing not the final pop. Russell Crowe is the careful worker in The Next Three Days but hes by no means a master of his pursuit. Hes Pittsburgh literature professor John Brennan who knows a lot about tilting at windmills in Don Quixote but not very much about obtaining illegal guns faking I.D. breaking into jail and evading police. He sets out to learn these criminal acts after his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) is sent to prison for a murder hes convinced she didnt commit but which the viewer is less than certain about. A coat with tell-tale bloodstains seems to give the game away. Revising a 2008 French film by Fred Cavaye that had a much more direct intent and title (Anything for Her) Haggis is determined not to spoon-feed the story. He doles out the red herrings which tease right from the start but hes stingy with the convenient coincidences that are so common to the genre and to some of his past work. His Oscar-winning Crash was rife with coincidences -- people had a habit of running into each other -- and his screenwriting gigs with the 007 films Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were obliged to follow a formula where incredible things occur on cue. The Next Three Days is intriguingly not like that -- at least until the third act when the cops of Pittsburgh suddenly turn into regular Sherlocks and the movie makes an unseemly sprint to the finish line. Haggis doesnt provide the standard motivation of undying love. A restaurant scene prior to Laras arrest suggests the couple might be on the outs. Their time together with their 6-year-old son Luke (Ty Simpkins) is so brief its hard to establish their parental bonds. Casting is another puzzle. Crowe can convincingly play a professor as he did in A Beautiful Mind but can he pull off Johns naivety as a regular citizen who enters the underworld in a brazen bid to bust his wife out of the hoosegow? It turns out he can adding the impulsiveness that so often accompanies innocence. Watching Johns dogged determination as he slowly amasses knowledge of dark criminal arts -- including a fast seminar on prison breaks from a cameoing Liam Neeson -- is reminiscent of another recent French movie Jacques Audiards A Prophet. John isnt one to be deterred even when told that the Pittsburgh pen hes attempting to crack is one of the worlds most secure prisons. The way he keeps collecting information pasting it all on a wall that he stares at nightly makes you think he might have seen The Usual Suspects. His focus doesnt shift even when hes confronted by a vexing drug dealer (Kevin Corrigan) a come-hithering playground mom (Olivia Wilde) or the doubts of wife Lara whom Banks convincingly plays as a woman of genuine mystery. But then theres that troublesome final act in which the meticulous turns mundane. Carefully avoided coincidence suddenly yields to miraculous occurrence as a thriller busts out although Haggis still teases us with a red herring or two. This may be a remake of a French film but the marketplace demands a Hollywood resolution and thats a break from tradition that Haggis isnt yet prepared to make.

Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) and John Brennan (Russell Crowe) in THE NEXT THREE DAYS. Photo Phil Caruso Lionsgate Next Three Days review Action meets inaction 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Next Three Days Lman3 Drama. Starring Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks. Directed by Paul Haggis. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If ""The Next Three Days"" were just a little more mindless it might have been more joyful. Its a drama with the soul of a high-concept action thriller An average guy (Russell Crowe) gets so frustrated that his wife has been wrongly convicted of murder that he decides to bust her out of jail. Right there thats a recipe for some kind of entertaining movie something far-fetched but satisfying involving big emotions and lots of adrenaline. But writer-director Paul Haggis doesnt push the story in the obvious direction. Instead he takes that premise - that of a French film called ""Pour Elle"" from two years ago - and dares to take it seriously. He asks what would it really be like for a guy to know that his innocent wife is locked up with no hope of parole? What would it really be like to be the woman imprisoned? Just how would that feel? Haggis answers these questions honestly earnestly and thoroughly but of course he has to do it within the overarching structure of the story. His approach is not the easiest fit for what is essentially action material but it brings some benefits. The main benefit is that it gives his actors something authentic to play. As the wife Elizabeth Banks crafts a very smart thought-out performance playing her as just confident and mercurial enough that other people might conceivably think her capable of murder even though she isnt. And then from within prison she shows us a distinct progression - from chastened and philosophical to fearful and despairing to bitter and spiritually adrift. Haggis constructs the movie so that we see her as the husband does on prison visits and we experience her deterioration with increasing gloom. Banks is so good so clean clear and precise in her technique that she makes it easy for Crowe who plays the helpless witness to his wifes emotional and physical decline. The misery of this injustice is very much felt as well as the mans frustration which is undoubtedly the greatest imaginable frustration that of a man unable to protect his own wife. Crowe can do the sensitive regular-guy thing but its also very easy to believe that his rage runs deep and that in ways in which this upstanding citizen has never been tested he is dangerously tough. Like ""Gladiator"" tough. We believe he can do anything. There might have at least been a kick to that. But alas Haggis commitment to bringing out the truth of the premise turns the ""The Next Three Days"" into a downbeat film. With an action movie we feel distance and look forward to seeing justice being done. But watching a drama about a nice lady who gets locked up we just feel bad. Even worse because Haggis chooses to ground the film in a realistic convention and make it as plausible as possible he becomes obligated to take events wed just naturally accept in an action context and render them practically and psychologically believable. This takes time. Lots of it as it turns out. Ive never seen ""Pour Elle"" the prototype of ""The Next Three Days"" but I do know it runs 92 minutes. Haggis reconception runs 122 minutes - and definitely feels about a half hour too long. Haggis writes good scenes and casts good actors and there are many moments that are emotionally effective so the movie is hardly a waste of time. But the overall strategy doomed it from the start. ""The Next Three Days"" is at once too silly to be a serious drama and too serious for us to suspend our disbelief and look forward to seeing Russell Crowe doing damage. If only it were at least fun - but its not. -- Advisory Russell Crowe is a nice guy. Just dont get him mad.

Photo Everett Collection / Everett Col Olivia Wilde as a young mother and Russell Crowe in ""The Next Three Days."" ( ) ""The Next Three Days"" resembles another quietly involving little thriller ""The Town."" Only this time the loot is a woman instead of a sack of money -- now were talking about a Banks job. Elizabeth Banks a hilarious presence on ""30 Rock"" proves she has dramatic flair as Lara an angry Pittsburgh professional locked in a state of office combat with her boss. When her workplace enemy becomes suddenly and violently dead Lara begins to look like a murderess. Also Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon. The state of Pennsylvania orders her to change her plans for the next 20 years. The imprisoned Lara has no hope but she does have a husband John (Russell Crowe) a professor at a community college. His special subject? Don Quixote. Exhausting all appeals on Laras case he seeks some advice from a career con (Liam Neeson) who has broken out of prison seven times. How John wants to know might jailbreak be done a la Pittsburgh? Among the surprising things I learned in this movie is that if your wife should go away on a murder beef you should immediately invest in a supply of marking pens and start drawing enormous diagrams and formulas on the wall. Obtain maps inquire about false identification sell everything in the house (then sell the house) to stockpile bribe money and try not to think about the alarming evidence against your wife. I didnt buy how ""The Next Three Days"" plays out -- but I almost bought it and thats good enough for a thriller. Writer-director Paul Haggis (""Crash"") who based his script on Frances ""Pour Elle"" invests considerable care in the genuine affection between John and Lara and in the ordinary details of Johns life. The non-glam Pittsburgh locations and Crowes controlled desperation help to make the movie convincing as a simple domestic drama that ever so gently slips into a caper. ""The Next Three Days"" is the kind of worthy project that makes studios shy; ""meticulous"" isnt much of a pull-quote to use in the advertising. As a procedural the film is exact and sober laying out each step of the process by which you might learn to pick a lock or break into a car. Its a little sad in cinematic terms that the answer to both these questions is to consult the appropriate YouTube video. (Horror movies have lately suffered the same drama deflation; whereas the damned used to have to find the dustiest book of witchy lore now they just Google the solution to the curse). And there are hours of honorable and diligent procedurals on television each week. But TV doesnt have Russell Crowe. Few actors can so readily convey both intelligence and toughness. When he finds himself armed and sitting in front of a bank or holding a lit match over a pool of alcohol at a meth lab Crowe is a formidable presence. How far will this placid schoolteacher go? His is essentially the only fully realized character though. Lara is aloof and mysterious while Neeson has only a cameo. Brian Dennehy does well with few words as Johns nearly silent father but mostly the movie is Johns tireless devotion. His wife tells him hes too perfect and its hard to disagree In the midst of all the madness of his plan he remembers to pack her moisturizer. Still his iron will creates some breathless moments most of them wisely saved up for a richly realized final act. ""The Next Three Days"" which may be the first movie in which a Prius gets shot up (""What kind of criminal drives a Prius?"" wonders one cop) and in which the details of a childs birthday party invitation could be as important as a getaway route strikes an arresting balance of the ordinary and the unlikely.

The story A man goes to any lengths necessary to free his wife from jail even when her innocence is cast into doubt. Starring Liam Neeson Russell Crowe Elizabeth Banks Olivia Wilde Jonathan Tucker Brian Dennehy RZA Lennie James Jason Beghe Moran Atias Director Paul Haggis Running time 202 Release Opened Nov 19 2010  Editorial Review Sadly theres nowhere to runBy Ann HornadayFriday November 19 2010Russell Crowe delivers a glum recessive performance as a community college professor lured into a life on the lam in ""The Next Three Days."" The movies best scene in which Crowes character encounters an author played by Liam Neeson subliminally nods to ""Taken"" the action thriller starring Neeson that became a breakout hit two years ago. But ""The Next Three Days"" never achieves the earlier films taut intensity. Rather it plods along dutifully with the occasional zigzag into contrivance tidy coincidence and outright preposterousness. When ""The Next Three Days"" opens Pittsburgh literature teacher John Brennan (Crowe) is meeting his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) for dinner with Johns brother and his bombshell wife. Almost immediately Lara and her sister-in-law begin arguing the fight getting more heated; later in the car John and Lara enjoy an illicit moment of post-catfight sex. The scenes are clearly meant to bring Laras impulses and passions to the forefront of filmgoers minds when the next day shes charged with having murdered a co-worker just moments before arriving at the restaurant. John goes to every legal length to prove his wifes innocence but when he exhausts those avenues and Lara is facing a lengthy prison term he takes matters into his own hands. This is when ""The Next Three Days"" which was written and directed by Paul Haggis (""Crash"" ""In the Valley of Elah"") turns into a vigilante action thriller for the Internet age with the mild-mannered teacher cadging advice on breaking into cars from YouTube video. Neeson plays an ex-con who has written books on breaking out of jail and he provides a welcome note of vividness to an otherwise drab proceeding. When John decides to plunge into the world of drug dealers and meth labs ""The Next Three Days"" might as well be titled ""Grim and Grimmer."" Although ""The Next Three Days"" features some nifty chases and a terrific Pittsburgh cop duo played by Jason Beghe and Aisha Hinds (the latter of whom can also be seen in the Pennsylvania-set ""Unstoppable"") its chief problem is what the professional call ""rootability."" Banks who takes her looks down-market to play the prison-bound Lara never works up enough sympathy for the audience to egg John on. (Later she seems to have found a source of magical hair highlights and Velcro rollers during a crucial sequence.) Some terrific twists and double feints at the end notwithstanding ""The Next Three Days"" never fully embraces its identity as pulp entertainment. Instead Haggis constantly reminds viewers of his own high-mindedness by larding the movie with literary pretensions such as underlining Johns Quixotic quest by having him teach ""Don Quixote.""

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Next Three Days   (out of four) Stars Russell Crowe Elizabeth Banks Liam Neeson Olivia Wilde Brian DennehyDirector Paul HaggisDistributor LionsgateRating PG-13 for violence drug material language some sexuality and thematic elementsRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Despite a veteran cast and a couple of Academy Award heavyweights The Next Three Days manages to remain less than the sum of its parts. A remake of the 2008 French thriller Pour Elle Days boasts strong performances and solid action. But it swings between being a whodunit and a guns-blazing romp. By films end you may not be sure what it is either. TRAILER Block off some time for The Next Three Days Directed by Paul Haggis (Crash) Days begins with a specialty from the Oscar-winning writer/director arguments this one a dinner dispute over sexual politics in the workplace. Days lugs so deliberately forward it plays like an examination of secret desires and the strangers in our beds. But when community college instructor John (Russell Crowe) sees his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) arrested for murder hubby leaps into action. And the film leaps off the tracks. In the span of about four minutes -- or all of Liam Neesons screen time -- Crowe turns from a good-natured dad to dead-eye marksman. Yet we see little of the transformation. Instead Days delivers in spurts. Crowe regains some of his mischievous charm at least early in the film. Hes a playful dad and a doting husband a departure from his sullen anti-heroes of late. And while shes not an obvious choice for this material the typically bubbly Banks (The 40-Year-Old Virgin 30 Rock) does a solid job as a newbie inmate particularly in a wordless scene where Banks learns shes lost an appeal. But thats right about when Days veers wildly. Suddenly John has tracked down renowned escape artist turned author Damon Pennington (Neeson who doesnt take his hat off for the cameo). In the time it takes to have a cup of coffee John has coaxed the secrets of prison breaks from Damon and begins plotting a labyrinthine escape involving drug heists and forged medical documents. John gets as far as he does because the cops are dimwits. In another gear-shift police are clueless through most of the movie until a detective pieces the truth years later apparently by staring at rain. Far-fetched is fine in most action flicks. And it would work here if Days were a straightforward police story. Crowe has plenty of Hollywood accolades from becoming someone else. But even he is stretched by a script that calls for him to muse poetic about Don Quixote then shoot a man in the heart while lying on a stair landing. To Haggis credit Days hopscotches through time and keeps audiences uncertain about Laras innocence. But the effect is to distance us from Lara. By the finale (which has a few false starts) its unclear whom we should be cheering. Or exactly what were watching.

"Three reasons to not go see this - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Paul HaggisMOVIE REVIEW Three reasons to not go see this1. Russell Crowe phones it in. 2. Paul Haggis beats you over the head. 3. Jailbreak?November 19 2010|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC Billboards for the new Russell Crowe action thriller ""The Next Three Days"" pose a provocative question What if you had 72 hours to save everything you live for? Because Crowe presumably still cares about his acting career might I suggest ""Run Russell run Save yourself.""Forget Lara (Elizabeth Banks) the wife and convicted murderer that youre hoping to break out of jail. I know you think shes innocent but she has a really bad temper. Shes a bottle blond as prison reveals (the only thing about her that prison reveals). But most important you guys have no chemistry. Zilch. Nada. Ditch her.Forget the kid too. I know that might sound harsh to say about your son. But whether hes crying in a high chair as Three Year Old Luke or ""three years later"" sleeping in the backseat of the car (the rest of us should be so lucky) hell be better off with the grandparents. They seem nice and Ive always really liked Brian Dennehy in just about any role.By the way what is it with the number three? The last three years the last three hours the next three days. Who cares? About 33 minutes in I couldnt help but think if they do another close-up of your watch as it tick tick ticks toward another three I will scream.But honestly any screaming should be directed at Paul Haggis who both wrote and directed this mess. The filmmaker behind the Oscar-winning ""Crash"" with its powerfully salient interlocking stories of race and life in L.A. has totaled this one. Yes ""The Next Three Days"" is really that bad.Whether writing or directing or both hes never one for nuance and even in his best work -- ""Million Dollar Baby"" ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" ""Casino Royale"" to name a few -- Haggis seems obsessed with making sure we ""get it"" in every scene. You can almost feel the hammer poised right above your head to pound the point home. Beyond that the film is too long on exposition in some places too short in others never just right.In the first few minutes Haggis telegraphs nearly everything youre ever going to learn about the characters so dont blink. There is just one ""fateful"" night when everything goes wrong. Crowes John Brennan is a soft-spoken community college professor. Theres a dinner and Lara a high-end professional of some sort goes all postal about whether the friction at work is because her boss is a woman. Duck the cliches are flying.Flash forward to the cops breaking down the door to arrest Lara for the murder of her boss. Flash forward again to prison doors slamming. Flash forward yet again to the appeal being denied and Daniel Stern as her attorney saying to John ""Just look at the evidence"" which is a nice idea but we never get to.After all this flashing things slooooooow down. On the bright side it does bring us the films best worst moment coming not long after Professor John finds an ex-cons (Liam Neeson) how-to book titled ""Over the Wall"" on the Internet (like I said the hammer is poised). They have the greatest bad conversation in a seedy diner ever -- do you take one or two lumps of melodrama in that coffee?Soon Johns plotting the jailbreak by pasting photos and scraps of maps and scrawling notes all over a wall in his house. A lot of time will be spent looking at that wall so settle in. Some action and other stuff follows no surprises there.In the spirit of ""this hurts me more than it does you"" because I am actually a fan of Crowes work I cant imagine a blander more barely there performance from the actor. For most of the film its as if hes desperate not to be seen or heard. You cant really blame him especially when hes forced to quote Don Quixote in a classroom to explain why hes about to go from law-abiding to criminally crazy.After a creative hot streak that began with 1999s ""The Insider"" followed by 2000s ""Gladiator"" and then ""A Beautiful Mind"" in 2001 all earning Oscar nominations with a win for ""Gladiator"" the actor has been more miss than hit. Its as if filmmakers have forgotten how wonderfully vulnerable he can be behind that tough guy scowl and sturdy frame. Haggis certainly never figures it out. You just have to hope that someone remembers if not in the next three days then soon.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--The Next Three DaysMPAA rating PG-13 for violence drug material language some sexuality and thematic elementsRunning time 2 hours2 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTIFF Paul Haggis says viewers of his new film may be...September 12 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTPaul HaggisCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-next-three-days-20101119,0,3565481.story",200,thenextthreedays13,thenextthreedays,latimes

It wants to be taut and suspenseful tricky and exciting. To be fair the movie manages to conjure small moments of all those things. But by the end its succeeded at none of them. Movie Information The Next Three DaysRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirected by Paul HaggisStarring Russell Crowe Elizabeth Banks Brian Dennehy and Liam NeesonRun time 133 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence drug material language some sexuality and thematic elements)Synopsis Crowe tries to break his wife (Elizabeth Banks) out of jail.More movies from GuideLive.comWritten and directed by Paul Haggis the movie is full of his familiar narrative gambits. The Academy Award-winning screenwriter of films including Crash (which he also directed) and Million Dollar Baby shuffles the sequence of events and plays tricks with time dropping sequence titles such as ""Last Three Years"" and ""Last Three Months"" as instructions to help viewers reassemble the pieces into a linear story line.Russell Crowe is John Brennan a college professor married to Elizabeth Banks Lara. After a brief strange opening with John driving a car on a rain-slicked night with some poor soul rasping in the back seat the movie introduces us to John and Lara at a restaurant with another couple. Lara gets into a fiery argument with the other woman; a bemused John walks her back to their car where she pounces on him for a little in-car canoodling before they return home to their slumbering young son and another round of passionate grappling.This is to establish just how deeply and hotly John and Laras love for each other burns. Thats important since that motivation is going to be all the viewer gets to make sense of the next two-plus hours of otherwise unaccountable and generally unpleasant action. The next morning the police break in and cart Lara off to jail for murdering her boss. From there Haggis starts time-shifting and scene-shuffling.You are supposed to connect disparate dots and pick up on clues Haggis leaves like a trail of bread crumbs through the thicket of the movies structure. You know for example that time has passed when John visits Lara in prison and her hair is no longer blond - its not the next day its the next year or the year after that. Whoa.The movie quickly establishes the hopelessness of Laras situation - shes serving a life sentence - so it can settle into what its really about John obsessively scheming to break her out. Haggis spends a lot of time on the details of Johns plans. In one of the movies best scenes John consults with an escaped prisoner turned author (Liam Neeson) who gives him a breakdown of everything for which he needs to prepare. Its great stuff; too bad that is the only time we see or hear from Neeson.This is almost exclusively Crowes movie. John is the only character we get to know and we really never know much about him. We never understand for example why he loves his wife so much while giving barely a thought about his young son.As for everybody else including Lara who really knows? Brian Dennehy as Johns father spends a lot of time looking grimly approving of his sons choices while uttering a couple of dozen words the entire movie. And whats the deal with the pair of cops who remain obsessed with John and Lara? Thats the shortcoming of Haggis style. He presents his cinematic shorthand as a clever-cool way of telling a story but its really just a way of making the viewer do his work for him.The Next Three Days is too long and full of the kind of ludicrous coincidences and preposterous moments that will have you laughing when youre supposed to be tearing up or gasping in shock. It wants to be intense but more often is just intensely stupid. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Next Three Days The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; next-three-days-the ) Next Three Days The (United States 2010) November 18 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Next Three Days Paul Haggis adaptation of the 2008 French film Anything for Her uses an interesting concept as a cornerstone of the foundation. Instead of employing a seasoned professional as the lead character of this heist thriller the movie makes the protagonist a rank amateur. Hes an everyman sort and like any normal individual placed in this situation he makes a lot of mistakes. Thrillers about break-ins (or in this case a breakout) often dwell on the brilliance of the plot which can at times be Rube Goldberg-esque in its cleverness and complexity. Thats not the case here where instances of brilliance are offset by blunders. Unfortunately attempts at ""realism"" are thwarted by an overreliance upon coincidence. Nevertheless especially as the movie shifts into high gear during its final 30 minutes The Next Three Days offers enough suspense to make it worth the price of admission. The Next Three Days begins with an out-of-context scene of a blood-spattered man driving a car erratically then flashes back three years to begin the tale of how he got to that point. John (Russell Crowe) and his wife Laura (Elizabeth Banks) are dining out. Shes in a bad mood because of a knock-down argument she had with her boss earlier - one that will likely result in her losing her job. By the next morning however things have calmed down - until the police barge through the front door and arrest Laura for murder. The next time we encounter her she has already been tried and convicted and the appeal is not going well. Dragged down by a whirlpool of despair she tries to kill herself. At that point John decides he must take action desperate though it may be. He contacts a notorious prison escapee (Liam Neeson) and hears firsthand what it takes to break out. After that John begins plotting how to spring Laura from her current incarceration and after that how to escape with her and their son to a country that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. Its intriguing to watch a movie in which all the steps in Johns ambitious plan do not go like clockwork. His inept attempts at obtaining a fake passport prove to be physically dangerous. Later an ill-advised run-through of a critical phase fails and puts the police on notice that hes up to something. Were not used to seeing a protagonist this flawed in an action movie. In many ways it adds a layer to the tension because having seen how easily John can screw up theres no sense of inevitability about how things will end. The pre-ordained conclusion one would expect from a more traditional thriller is not mandated here. Two things reduce the overall enjoyment quotient. The first is an overuse of coincidence - a frequent flaw of thrillers. Haggis must be drawn to screenplays that are heavy in contrivance; his Crash was steeped in it. The circumstances by which Laura is wrongly accused of murder are an example of a script straying too far into artificiality. She happens to have a public argument with a woman who is later killed. The killer happens to bump into her on the way from the crime thereby depositing a blood smear on Lauras clothing. The murder weapon happens to be in front of her car when she goes to pull out of a parking space so when she moves it she leaves behind fingerprints. And so on... A few coincidences are often not noticed or easily dismissed but The Next Three Days lathers them on too thickly for them to be cleanly ignored. In fact the suspense that builds around the climax is dependent upon multiple coincidences. This sort of thing is more noticeable in movies that attempt to inject a dose of ""reality"" than in those that are unapologetically over-the-top. Thats one danger of attempting to ground a thriller; Haggis is not successful in navigating around the pitfall. Fortunately although it may cause a little head-shaking it doesnt derail the enterprise. Secondly Russell Crowe is miscast. Although his filmography is littered with instances of his playing ordinary human beings as well as macho men there is something unnatural about the reticence of this character. Crowes performance feels oddly neutered - its almost as if theres a conventional action hero lurking just beneath the surface who is never unleashed. For an actor as dynamic as Crowe normally is its almost off-putting to see him in a role where theres no magnetism. John is not a strong protagonist and this makes it difficult to identify with him. The other performers are fine. Elizabeth Banks effectively transitions from gorgeous wife and mother to somewhat bedraggled prisoner (this includes a change of hair color which I believe is meant to indicate a decrease in glamour.) Her work here is among the most convincing dramatic acting she has done to date. Liam Neeson is mesmerizing in a one-scene cameo. Olivia Wilde on hiatus from House keeps her TV American accent for a strangely underwritten and low-profile role. And its a pleasure to see Brian Dennehy cast against type as a supportive grandfather. Both the screenplay and Haggis direction are littered with red herrings and misdirection especially during sequences that intercut the police closing in with Johns attempts to elude them. The approach hearkens back to Hitchcock who was a master of this sort of thing. In fact the movie as a whole has a Hitchcockian edge - the ordinary guy trapped in a web not of his own devising. In Hitchcocks films however the heroes tended to be more suave and less bumbling than John. The Next Three Days will not win Paul Haggis another Academy Award but flawed though it may be it offers two solid hours of entertainment the last quarter of which is genuinely gripping. And despite its prior cinematic origins this wont feel like a retread to American audiences (even those who frequent art houses). The original French film did not have a U.S. distributor and has not been released on DVD in North America.

Pictures ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" starring Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. By Joe Morgenstern Updated Nov. 18 2010 1201 a.m. ET Its not a good sign or portent or whatever that the only affecting character in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1"" proves to be the emancipated elf Dobby a bandy-legged floppy-eared scrawny-necked and mostly digital creature--based on Toby Joness performance--who yanks really hard at your heartstrings in his hour of distress. Nor is it much help that Dobbys big moment comes almost two hours into this ponderous film adaptation of the seventh and last book in J.K. Rowlings series. (Part 2 will unfold as another full-length feature.) Then what of Harry Ron and Hermione? Well theyre on a climactic mission to defeat the evil and essentially noseless Voldemort by finding and destroying all the Horcruxes failing which we might never get to Part 2. Along the way you may find yourself obsessing about exactly how many Horcruxes must still be found since the dark and doomy mission is relieved only by a cheerful wedding a pleasant dance and a beautiful stretch of animation. Whats worse some mysterious movie curse has turned the three once-lively adventurers into wood. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry spends a great deal of time looking pensive or worried. At one point he says with exasperation ""This is completely mental"" Yes and you wish it were emotional. Hermione is still the brains of the operation yet the appealing young actress Emma Watson is called upon to wear a bleak expression that ill becomes her. (Did the director David Yates forget that at least some of this stuff was supposed to be fun?) Rupert Grint has grown up to be a skillful actor who knows the value of a slow burn but the book dictates that Ron be afflicted by jealousy and anger so here again what you read is what you get and not one smile more. ENLARGE Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. Warner Bros. Pictures Related Article Bringing a Dark World to Life | Video The book dictates a vast assortment of details interludes and ancillary characters; thats the nature and the pleasure of literary density. Their presence in the movie which was adapted by Steve Kloves may well be obligatory as well as gratifying to the books fans but they take an awful toll on narrative momentum--every two minutes the action whooshes sideways to someone somewhere else. Those characters include multiple Harrys as decoys a device thats handled joylessly. The interludes include a long--and I mean long--stay in a forest where Hermione uses an extension charm (not that the movie needed extension) to turn her small bag into a cornucopia containing among other things a camping tent. Many of the productions deficits are baffling--the commonplace chases the murky look the indifferent effects--but none more so than the interior of the tent which looks like a big and banal stage set before the enchantment sets in. On the other hand that animated sequence which illustrates a crucial fairy tale in shadow-puppet style is as charming as can be. The whole thing could have used animation. The Next Three Days Watch a clip from Lionsgates ""The Next Three Days"" in which Russell Crowe plays a husband desperately trying to free his wife from prison. Also starring Elizabeth Banks and Liam Neeson. How you feel about Paul Haggiss new film may depend on your contrivance threshold. Mine is fairly low to begin with (unless the contrivances are gleefully bold as in last weeks ""Unstoppable"") and even lower when it comes to movies like Mr. Haggiss ""Crash"" which depends on intricate contrivances that you either accept and enjoy or in my case instinctively reject. ""The Next Three Days"" asks its audience to accept a lot. Elizabeth Banks is Lara Brennan a loving wife and mother convicted wrongly--or was she?--of murder. Russell Crowe is John Brennan her loving logical and presumably sane husband who leaves conventional logic and all but a semblance of his sanity behind while devising an elaborate plan to break his wife out of an escape-proof Pittsburgh prison. (Mr. Haggis adapted the script from a French film unknown to me called ""Pour Elle."") The movies concern is the power of irrationality which can yield remarkable achievements at terrible costs. John achieves what he does either by seeking equipment and advice from shady characters (anyone would have to be slightly bonkers at the outset to trust the escape artist that Liam Neeson plays with a bad New York accent) or by plumbing the depths of the Web for information on such arcana as making a bump key--which opens locks by bumping their tumblers--or breaking into a car. (Good thing he didnt want to make an atomic bomb.) ENLARGE Russell Crowe and Brian Dennehy play son and father in The Next Three Days. Lionsgate As the tension builds its easy to join the irrationality and truly enjoy it; the level of filmmaking craftsmanship is high and Mr. Crowe gives his character unearned credibility; the actor must have relished the notion of a law-abiding citizen who becomes a criminal for the sake of love. Theres at least one moment when all of the contrivance subsides long enough for genuine feeling to come forth--its when Johns father played by Brian Dennehy bids his son goodbye knowing they may never meet again. And Mr. Haggis deserves props for shattering the myth that all Prius drivers are good. But his movie wears you down while its whipping you up. Contrivance can have a long arm too; eventually this one breaks. Made in Dagenham Watch a clip from ""Made in Dagenham"" a dramatization of the 1968 strike at the Ford Dagenham car plant where female workers walked out in protest against sexual discrimination starring Sally Hawkins Bob Hoskins and Andrea Riseborough. This drama of labor strife in England was inspired by historical fact--a strike at an outmoded Ford plant in late 1960s England--and its subject is an important one Equal pay for women doing the same work as men. Nonetheless ""Made in Dagenham"" plays like ""Norma Rae"" on blood thinners. The movie is by no means bloodless; every once in a while a stirring scene comes along though its seldom a scene labeled as stirring by William Ivorys formulaic script and Nigel Coles insistent direction. (Mr. Cole did a more graceful film called ""Calendar Girls"" a few years ago.) Yet the story is thin because its so predictable. ENLARGE Rosamund Pike as a car executives wife in Made in Dagenham. Sony Pictures Classics Most scenes display their labels in their opening frames Rita OGrady the working-class heroine in spite of herself (Sally Hawkins a quirky star in a prefab role); Eddie OGrady (Daniel Mays) the immature husband who wont take his wifes crusade seriously; Albert (Bob Hoskins) the incorruptible union man who supports the crusade. And in a remarkably far-fetched piece of plotting Rita teams up with a wealthy woman Lisa Hopkins (Rosamund Pike) who happens to be married to a Ford executive. But then those scenes sneak up and grab you. In one of them the Cambridge-educated Lisa tells Rita ""Im 31 years old I have a first-class honors degree from one of the great universities of the world and my husband treats me like a fool."" Its a moment that reminds you if you needed reminding that Ms. Pike like Ms. Hawkins is a formidable actress.  In last weeks column I misspelled the name of the excellent New Zealand cinematographer Ben Seresin who shot ""Unstoppable."" DVD FOCUS Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) ENLARGE Alfonso Cuarons screen version of the third novel in J.K. Rowlings series summons up a world that never fully came to life in the first two films notwithstanding their strenuous pace and razzle-dazzle effects. Its a world in which the natural and supernatural coexist readily almost casually yet a dark and dangerous world in which the suddenly teenage hero must confront a mortal fatefully personal threat. For whatever its worth on the part of someone outside the target demographic I didnt miss the dazzle let alone the razzle. The movies set pieces seduce you with elegance wit or suspense. L.A. Confidential (1997) Its been a long time since Russell Crowe made an indelible mark as Bud White the Los Angeles cop who undergoes a convincing metamorphosis from scowling thug to shining knight. This 1950s-era crime drama has it all and does it all with a casual mastery that Hollywood once owned but had seemingly misplaced or lost. The substance is pure pulp--crooked cops greedy mobsters seductive dames shiny cars--but the style is delicately ironic. Curtis Hanson directed a flawless cast that includes Kim Basinger Guy Pearce Kevin Spacey Danny DeVito James Cromwell and Ron Rifkin. Happy Go Lucky (2008) Sally Hawkins gives an astonishing performance in Mike Leighs one-of-a-kind comedy about a young Englishwoman Poppy whose vast joie de vivre is matched by a desperate need to feel good. And Poppy is not the only perfect portrait in the film though shes certainly the main one. Her flatmate and fellow teacher Zoe is played by Alexis Zegerman. Karina Fernandez is her hilariously passionate flamenco teacher and Eddie Marsan is Scott her obsessive-compulsive misogynist of a driving instructor. His wild anger is fully equal to Poppys epic sweetness. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint A few weeks ago I was bellyaching in this space about American remakes of foreign films inevitably going wrong. Here comes ""The Next 3 Days"" to make a liar out of me. Its a cool engrossing thriller; intelligent packed with shivering suspense populated with marvelous characters and (unless youve seen the French original ""Pour Elle"") impressively unpredictable. The movies title doesnt even appear on the screen until the film is an hour old. Russell Crowe is John Brennan a Pittsburgh community-college teacher whose volatile wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) is serving a life sentence for murder. The film squanders little time on the issue of her guilt. A studio thriller ordinarily would go to great lengths to reassure audiences that they are identifying with a wrongly convicted innocent. Not doing so is one of the shrewdest moves in this very shrewd movie; it concentrates our attention on the matter at hand. John convinced that Lara will die in prison unless he acts begins plotting her escape. He doesnt tell her knowing that she would veto a plan that could backfire leaving their 6-year-old Luke an orphan. Secretively methodically John begins transforming himself from a respectable middle-class single father into a criminal. It is an intimidating and dangerous process that blurs the line between his best and worst impulses. John is sharply drawn. He follows clear motivations. The loner son of a terse distant father (Brian Dennehy making a huge impression with minimal dialogue) John uses working-class Irish irony to keep self-pity at bay. He keeps his emotions bottled up because if they erupt his family will never be reunited. He arranges a barroom meeting with a famed prison-escape artist (a cameo too neat to spoil) who warns him of the snares and traps awaiting him. If he does this thing he will have to be willing to kill anyone who blocks his route. Crowes guarded expression shows that John is silently interrogating himself Is his anger great enough? Is he tough enough to deal with the thugs he will encounter? A bruising early attempt to buy fake passports suggests that hes not the man for this job. A late reversal when he bludgeons Lara with awful emotional blackmail makes us question whether weve been rooting for the right man. Crowe is perfectly matched to the role and Banks in a departure from comedy is solid as his wife. Writer/director Paul Haggis (""Crash"") stocks the peripheral roles with vividly effective character actors. An exacting craftsman Haggis draws us into the characters lives gradually. Starting slowly is the key to igniting the thrill-packed climax. When its finally time for split-second escapes weve completely identified with John. Were with him when his mission drives him to the brink of unforgivable acts. We will him not to act too ruthlessly yet we wish hed succeed. THE NEXT 3 DAYS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for violence drug material language some sexuality and thematic elements. At times the film seems stunningly conventional. In his study John creates the cliched Wall of Obsession pasting maps photos escape routes and timetables into a giant collage. But dont smirk too soon; the old device is setting up a clever reversal farther down the road. Haggis relishes subverting expectations. Unlike ""The Great Escape"" where we watch a plan develop and savor its unfolding ""The Next 3 Days"" skillfully keeps us uncertain whats happening. Something John does with a bolt-cutter pays off much later; actions that seem like mistakes later surprise the police and us viewers. We dont know what John has up his sleeve and each crisis makes us wonder if he will recover. Freed from needless exposition the tension builds relentlessly. ""The Next 3 Days"" is a textbook case of economical suspenseful screen storytelling.

Olivia Wilde plays a friend in ""The Next Three Days.""By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted November 19 2010So Hilary Swank puts herself through college and law school overcomes bureaucratic hurdles and legal road blocks and wrecks her marriage all to free her wrongly imprisoned brother charged with murder in Conviction.Well none of that for Russell Crowe.In Paul Haggis two-thirds terrific thriller The Next Three Days Crowe plays John Brennan a Pittsburgh college professor whose wife has been arrested for killing her boss. Shes tried convicted and sent to jail. Time passes. John is left taking care of the couples young son. The case is appealed. Meanwhile Elizabeth Banks as Lara Brennan is stuck in a cell in a red jumpsuit her hair getting dirtier her face glummer.And then all legal avenues exhausted John with the help of YouTube instructional videos Google searches and a chat with a veteran prison escapee (Liam Neeson in a nifty cameo) maps out how hes going to get his wife out of the slammer.Adapted from a French suspenser Anything for Her and carrying itself like a solid B-movie noir The Next Three Days follows Crowe as he goes from teaching Don Quixote (""belief in virtue"" he tells his students ""is more imporant than virtue itself"") to learning locksmith techniques to planning a future for Lara and their boy. A future that necessitates a change of locale new identities and a truckload of money.Haggis a veteran of TV cop shows and legal dramas before he started writing for Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby Letters From Iwo Jima) and winning Oscars (for the race-relations soap Crash) has taken French filmmaker Fred CavayA(c)s premise and run with it. That is until The Next Three Days final half-hour - when some prolonged pace-killing police chases undermine a lot of the taut suspenseful business that has come before.On screen for most of the films two hours-plus Crowe is tamped down but intense. Hes the quietly obsessed spouse immersing himself in stuff that literature professors dont normally have to deal with. Like arranging for fake passports. Or getting a gun. Or heisting a crack dealer.Banks who spends a good part of The Next Three Days behind bars shows range well beyond the raunchy farces and romantic comedies that have so far defined her career; there are emotionally tough scenes here and the actress acquits herself with a stony stoicism.The releases of Conviction and The Next Three Days within a month of each other may suggest that Americas criminal justice system is in need of serious repair (and perhaps it is). But apart from a core similarity - a dedicated protagonist setting out to free an incarcerated loved one - really these are different animals. Conviction for one is based on a true story and it has Oscar lust written all over it.The Next Three Days is genre fare - no pretensions no nonsense.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + If you want a solid no-frills example of A-list talents stooping to B-movie pleasures I hereby direct you to ""Unstoppable the runaway train movie currently in theaters. ""The Next Three Days represents the opposite approach a name filmmaker and star trying with all their might to pump a slender genre flick into an Oscar-caliber action-drama -- and failing.The writer-director is Paul Haggis (""Crash ""In the Valley of Elah) adapting a 2008 French thriller (""Anything for Her) that wasnt so hot itself. His first misstep casting Russell Crowe as John Brennan a Pittsburgh college professor who takes on the task of breaking his unjustly convicted wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) out of prison.The role calls for someone average nearly anonymous -- someone like you or me -- and at this point in his career Crowe is built to tangle with giants. He doesnt have the crazy gleam that an actor like Mel Gibson love him or hate him would bring to the proceedings nor does he possess the deluded intensity of Liam Neeson in ""Taken a silly movie that was a hit for that reason.Neeson turns up for one scene in ""The Next Three Days as a prison-escapee-turned-best-selling-author -- I guess he skipped the book tour -- who advises John in a patently absurd Brooklyn growl. So someone here is having fun. It isnt Crowe and it certainly isnt the audience. Because the stars presence overpowers his part the movies most interesting idea falls flat. How would a normal guy plot a prison break? With plenty of mistakes thats how. Yet we howl with disbelief when John needing fake passports simply drives to a bad neighborhood and asks the crack dealers. And wouldnt this man upon buying a gun already know ""where the bullets go?The wife was convicted of murdering her boss (Leslie Merrill) in a parking garage and the film tries to leave the question of her innocence open via a clumsy series of flashbacks. Banks wilts slowly and sympathetically over the course of the movie but its a thankless job. Appeals are exhausted Laras attorney (Daniel Stern) gives up and even the couples young son (Tyler Green) is ready to throw in the towel and admit that moms a lifer. John stolidly forges ahead selling his belongings and plotting Laras escape on a large carefully notated wall map just in case company comes by.The Internet no surprise turns out to be a boon and both John and we are schooled in such matters as ""bump keys and how to open a locked car with a tennis ball. On the other hand the hero has to learn how to shoot a couple of meth dealers (Kevin Corrigan and Jonathan Tucker) on his own. ""The Next Three Days fails to notice that John isnt behaving very heroically by this point but it does want us to know that nice guys dont rob banks.Haggis finally finds the movies groove late in the game and the escape sequence itself is hectic suspenseful and enjoyably ridiculous complete with a pirouetting suicide attempt at 80 miles per hour. Left behind in the tail wind are Olivia Wilde as a comely single mom and as Johns father dear old Brian Dennehy who gets more mileage out of less dialogue than anyone else here. Yet theres still no earthly reason for ""The Next Three Days to clock in at over two hours and that ponderousness sucks the life out of a movie that should have been fast and tight. Genre films that live or die by economy shouldnt be handed to a big spender.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Adapted from the 2008 French thriller Pour Elle Paul Haggis The Next Three Days runs nearly half an hour longer and in genre movies like this every extra minute is a lost one. Attempting to pivot from the weighty self-importance of his last two efforts In The Valley Of Elah and the Oscar-winning Crash Haggis tries to fashion a straightforward relatively unpretentious prison-break thriller but old habits die hard. What might have been a simple propulsive story about a mans single-minded mission to bust his wife out of jail instead feels needlessly cumbersome burdened by moral questions that dont add in value what they subtract in pace. While its a relief to see Haggis not preaching about say the evils of racism he doesnt wholly embrace the genre assignment which leaves him perpetually a beat or two behind. Russell Crowe narrows the intensity gap a little as a family man in upper-middle-class Pittsburgh whose world is suddenly upended when his wife is carted off to jail for murder. Taking a break from comedy Elizabeth Banks looks every bit the unlikely inmate as Crowes wife a seemingly perfect mother and career woman convicted of killing a co-worker. Crowe believes his wife to be innocent so when all appeals have been exhausted and her jail stay looks permanent he resolves to get her out of there himself. In a cameo role Liam Neeson plays an ex-con who gives him some assistance but gravely warns him that keeping her out will be even harder than breaking her out. Haggis digs into the recklessness of Crowes sacrifice If he gets caught he risks leaving his only child fatherless and even if he succeeds the kid might have to be left behind anyway. Add to that the too-coyly treated possibility that his wife really is guilty and belongs in jail and he has a lot on his mind even apart from the logistical difficulties of pulling off a prison break from the outside. The Next Three Days plays best when Haggis focuses on the meticulous planning and not-as-smooth execution of the break less well when he luxuriates in Crowes tormented psyche. Haggis doesnt trust the action to carry his themes across without emphasis and his movie suffers for it.

Mismatch of leads kills the thrills in The Next Three Days Article Tweet Lionsgate via AP Liam Neeson and Russel Crowe in The Next Three Days The Next Three Days Rated PG-13 (violence drug material language sexuality thematic elements); 122 minutes. In wide release. By Christy Lemire The Associated PressPosted 1059am on Wednesday Nov. 17 2010 Wednesday Nov. 17 2010 Thursday Nov. 18 2010 By Christy Lemire The Associated Press The main dynamic you have to accept in The Next Three Days -- the one that the entire story all the drama all the risk hinge upon -- is that Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks actually belong together.Always strong individually they make no sense as a couple. And thats a problem since it undermines our ability to become emotionally immersed in the danger in which they find themselves.As a result Paul Haggis thriller based on the 2008 French film Anything for Her ends up feeling even more implausible than it might have.The latest movie from the Oscar-winning Crash director finds Banks Lara Brennan being convicted of killing her boss in a Pittsburgh parking garage. Lara insists that she didnt commit the crime despite having a smudge of the victims blood on her trench coat and Haggis script provides flashback glimpses of that nights events keeping her guilt a mystery until the end.Once all of Laras appeals have run out and shes on the verge of being transferred to a state penitentiary her husband John hatches a scheme to break her out. John mind you is a mild-mannered community-college professor who already has his hands full caring for the couples 6-year-old son Luke (Ty Simpkins) alone.One would think that John might be dissuaded. But despite Crowes indisputable ability to transform himself and dig deep for every character he plays we never get a sense of whether crafting this plot weighs on Johns conscience. Banks meanwhile is believably hardened by her time behind bars.But the most intriguing figure of all is Liam Neeson as a grizzled ex-con who has literally written the book on prison breaks. The scene in which John tries to seek out his advice without giving away his intention briefly brings The Next Three Days to life. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

The Next Three Days (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Next Three Days (PG-13) Suspenseful thriller marred by running time and implausibility Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald11/17/2010 Editor rating 2.5 In The Next Three Days his third outing as director filmmaker Paul Haggis (Crash In the Valley of Elah) sets aside the socio-political commentary and hunkers down to craft a pressure cooker of a thriller. If only he had kicked the heat up a few notches. This remake of the 2008 French thriller Pour Elle is a half-hour longer less suspenseful and hobbled by a slacker pace. Haggis wants to use the extra time to make the viewer invest more fully in the plight of his characters but the story is so preposterous that the effort is wasted. This is a picture that should be constantly moving not dawdling from one thing to the next. Still the what-would-you-do? premise is hugely effective and sinks its hooks in early. John (Russell Crowe) and Lara (Elizabeth Banks) are a happily married couple with a bright 6-year-old son (Ty Simpkins) and a healthy sex life. In the films opening scene which shows the couple at a restaurant with friends Lara becomes provoked and unleashes a fiery temper but everyone gets angry from time to time. Then the next morning as the family is having breakfast  the cops burst in and arrest Lara of murdering her boss. The physical evidence is overwhelming Laras fingerprints are all over the fire extinguisher used to bash in the dead womans head; theres a large blood stain on the back of Laras jacket and co-workers had watched the women get into a heated argument earlier in the day. To Johns astonishment Lara is convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Three years of appeals later his lawyer (Daniel Stern) tells John theyve run out of options Shes never getting out. But after she attempts suicide in her cell John realizes that the courts ruling is simply not an option. He believes his wife is innocent and he refuses to watch her rot in jail. Some of the best sequences in The Next Three Days focus on John a mild-mannered college professor as he figures out exactly how you break someone out of prison. First he contacts the author of a book about a man (Liam Neeson in a terrific cameo) who pulled the trick off nine times. John learns hes going to need passports a gun a willingness to turn violent and lots and lots of cash. Haggis strives to keep the early portions of the movie firmly grounded in reality When John approaches a street drug dealer and asks if he knows of any way to score fake passports the result probably resembles what would happen if you or I tried the same thing. Like the best how-to movies The Next Three Days also teaches you things you didnt know such as the way to create a key that will open any lock (theres tremendous suspense when John tries to use a dummy key in full view of prison guards and security cameras and it snaps inside the keyhole). Other moments stretch credibility far past the breaking point When John is desperate for money he raids the home of a crystal-meth dealer at gunpoint and suddenly becomes an action hero dodging bullets and blowing away baddies like Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Haggis makes some half-hearted efforts at making us wonder whether Lara may be guilty but hes not much for dubiousness so we never really question her innocence. The prison break once it finally arrives is admittedly exciting and filled with unexpected twists but its a bit of a slog to get there. The Next Three Days might have fared a lot better if the screenwriters had stuck to The Next Two Days.

Jailbreaking is not Johns forte -- hes a community-college professor in Pittsburgh and he drives a Prius. But all judicial appeals have failed and the couples young son is so very sad. So spurred by love despair and belief in his wifes innocence John turns to desperate measures. First however he does some Internet homework that leads him to Damon (Liam Neeson) an ex-con-turned-author who provides expert advice on the art of escape. Damons how-to-break-the-law lesson -- as ludicrous as anything else in this enjoyably zigzaggy exercise in accumulating peril -- grants Neeson the fun of experimenting with an American ex-con accent for his one scene. It also sets up the movies real strength which is generating escalating waves of plot tension and misdirection as John heeding advice makes his jail-busting moves. Writer-director Paul Haggis (Crash) who adapted The Next Three Days from a 2008 French thriller Pour Elle clearly has Alfred Hitchcocks wrong-man-in-wrong-place psychological archetype in mind as John weaves all over Pittsburgh. Lara for her part has no idea of her husbands plan -- the usually sunnier Banks is an interesting counterintuitive casting choice -- and when she finds out she adds her own complications. Soon the chase becomes its own perpetual-motion machine one that ticks down to the last second. With cops closing in theres passport forgery robbery lock picking shooting and driving too fast while behind the wheel of a Prius. Theres also a bit of tampering with medical records the inevitable follow-up to Laras demonstration in Act 1 Scene 1 that shes diabetic. Throughout Crowe marshals his unique physical gravitas -- his way of speaking with his eyes while remaining very still and quiet -- to bolster Haggis more sentimental premise that the character represents any average John who loves his family deeply enough to declare Screw the system Were outta here While Crowe throws his serious weight behind the notion of a man angry weary and bereft enough of his ordinary life to take drastic steps the movie throws obstacle after obstacle his way and says to the audience Oh he squeaked through that?

Like his lumpy protagonist Haggis who also scripted this remake of the 2008 French thriller Pour Elle (never released stateside) too confidently assumes viewers are as quick to abandon sense and logic. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The films ordeal begins one morning three years ago at the breakfast table of the loving Brennan household which includes short-fused wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) and three-year-old son. Domestic bliss is interrupted by the cops barging in to arrest Lara for murder right at the moment shes trying to wash a bloodstain out of her trench coat--and the day after she had a horrible fight with her now-dead boss.Sporting tomato-red prison scrubs at the Allegheny County Jail and hairstyles and colors that will change drastically over the next 36 months and two-plus hours (barely onscreen Banks may have tried to squeeze in a LOreal ad campaign or two during the shoot) Lara grows both increasingly despondent as her kid withdraws from her and extra-horny without any conjugal visits. After Laras final appeal is rejected John--absolutely convinced of his spouses innocence despite a black-and-white dramatization of what might have happened as he pores over the contents of the box of evidence rendered with the subtlety of a nickelodeon one-reeler--travels to Brooklyn to meet an ex-con (Liam Neeson dressed up and squawking like a Bowery Boy) who offers prison-break tips.Once the second act begins with a title card announcing ""The Last 3 Months""--the amount of time John spends cooking up labyrinthine plans to spring Lara--Haggiss film becomes interminably nonsensical. The nutty professor Googles ""diabetic conditions"" (to fudge his insulin-injecting wifes lab report) and ""how to break into a car"" (to enter a van with said report); downloads a video on how to make a bump key; gets in his Prius to drive to the Bad Part of Town to ask for fake passports and . . . Oxycontin; gets beaten up by RZA; blows up a meth lab; crosses paths with Trudie Styler; and packs a toiletry kit for Laras great escape.As a writer-director Haggis has never been one for nuance or persuasive storytelling as anyone whos seen the ham-fisted Crash or In the Valley of Elah knows. But a co-writing credit on the 2006 James Bond revamp Casino Royale at least proved his ability to map out a sleek stylish caper. That skill is not evident in The Next Three Days which is so overcrowded with incompetent cops (including Haggiss fellow Scientology apostate Jason Beghe) and near-mute unaffecting blood ties (particularly Brian Dennehy as Johns dad and Ty Simpkins as six-year-old Luke) that the film fails in its attempts to maintain any suspense and establish John as a devoted family man monomaniacally driven to a desperate act.As for the roots of Johns unwavering constancy to Lara were forced to take them on faith since the husband and wife share about 10 minutes of screen time (consisting primarily of two instances of autopiloted fully clothed PG-13 rutting with abandon) before shes locked up. ""Would you save the woman you love if you knew that by doing so you would turn into someone that she might no longer be able to love?"" Haggis asks in the press notes by way of explaining the supposed emotional center of this ridiculous thriller. This of course presumes that Crowe comes across as lovable rather than as a bored actor in a dumb project who cannot wait to score that Oxycontin.1 Lionsgate Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Melissa Anderson Follow MelissEAnderson Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

A little-seen French thriller gets longer but not much better in ""The Next Three Days."" A mostly faithful remake of 2008s ""Anything for Her"" about a mans desperate scheme to spring his wife from jail Paul Haggis middling fourth feature evinces a sometimes pulse-quickening fascination with procedural details and climaxes with a good dose of swift suspenseful filmmaking. But what was briskly diverting in the original has been rather laboriously overworked and the films attempt to draw out the moral stakes never addresses the materials basic surface-level implausibility. Russell Crowes solid performance will attract visitors but breakout success looks elusive. Opening scenes briefly establish the domestic tranquility of Pittsburgh couple John (Crowe) and Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) before Lara is arrested on charges of murdering her boss and convicted on strong evidence. Certain of his wifes innocence John an academic whos left raising their young son Luke (Ty Simpkins) spends three years trying to clear her name. But as the chances of reopening the case look slim and Lara turns suicidal John realizes with growing desperation that he may have to seek justice through improper channels. Assistance comes from a wily ex-con (Liam Neeson in a toothsome cameo) who instructs John that getting Lara out will be easier than keeping her free and that to succeed hell need to be utterly ruthless even violent as the situation requires. Crucially hell also need a lot of cash. Thus ""The Next Three Days"" is both a prison-break thriller and a heist movie of sorts with Lara the carefully guarded prize and it pivots on a how-far-will-he-go tension as John maps out an escape plan learns to make skeleton keys and secures phony passports from the local riff-raff. But its not until he learns that Lara is about to be transferred to another jail -- in the brief time frame that gives the film its title -- that he takes drastic decisive action initiating his bloody baptism into the world of amoral criminality. Looking paunchier and more professorial than Vincent Lindon did in ""Anything for Her"" Crowe ably traces his characters dark descent and the preternaturally intelligent actor is good at suggesting that Johns scheme is not merely a personal crusade but a mental exercise. Theres a certain pleasure to be had in watching him grimly maneuver his way in and out of sticky situations even when it becomes apparent that John is a good deal smarter than the movie hes in. While it follows ""Anything for Her"" almost scene for scene even retaining director Fred Cavayes ticking-clock flashback structure ""The Next Three Days"" somehow manages to come in at an elephantine 133 minutes (compared to the originals fleet 96 minutes). Inflating a no-nonsense Euro quickie into a meaty three-course entertainment only slows down what should be accelerated giving the viewer plenty of time to notice gaping plausibility issues and miraculous coincidences of timing. A flair for manipulation and misdirection -- for seeding clues in act one that will pay off in act three -- has always been a hallmark of Hag-gis work as a writer-helmer (""Crash""""In the Valley of Elah"") indicating that a thriller of this sort with its elaborate machinery of setups and payoffs might be right up his alley. But aside from one sweaty-palmed scene in which John is nearly exposed most of the twists and embellishments feel ham-fisted and obvious. The films vague suggestion that Lara might actually be guilty (shown in teasing black-and-white flashbacks) reps a half-hearted attempt to introduce an element of moral ambiguity and pull the rug out from under the viewer. Dialogue is wielded like a cudgel; more than once the script mistakes raised voices for drama opening with a heated altercation thats intended to establish Laras temper but merely feels recycled from ""Crash."" Where the picture does excel is the prison break itself an exciting half-hour sequence that devises all manner of complications and takes strategic advantage of the Steel Citys urban layout -- complete with daring downtown getaways chases along subway platforms and even a quick stop at the Pittsburgh Zoo. Shooting in gray muted tones Stephane Fontaine (the ace lenser on another recent prison pic Jacques Audiards ""A Prophet"") uses an odd visual combination of darting camerawork widescreen framing and tight closeups; its a cramped claustrophobic style thats peculiar but effective. Banks Lara comes off as sympathetic yet realistically hardened by her time in the clink and Brian Dennehy and Helen Carey are sterling as Johns supportive if not always entirely approving parents; elsewhere the film has fleshed out various supporting roles to mostly awkward effect (one thug is made deaf for no reason). Danny Elfmans score dutifully channels the propulsive rhythms of Bernard Herrmann before veering into moody electronica in the downright hysterical closing stretch.

Daily Edition Login to download Todd McCarthys Film Review The Next Three Days 902 PM PST 11/9/2010 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Clever thriller needs a quicker pulse for big mainstream success. TWITTER A tasty pressure-cooker story is served lukewarm in The Next Three Days. In his third outing as a director Paul Haggis leaves aside political editorializing to focus on the intense efforts of a teacher to free his wife from 20 years imprisonment on a murder charge by the only means left to him -- engineering her escape. Although involving this remake of a recent French film never reaches the anticipated heights of excitement and suspense and Russell Crowes subdued characterization of an ordinary man who undertakes extraordinary actions remains a little too ordinary. This Lionsgate release looks headed for moderate box-office returns. Haggis projects from his self-directed features Crash and In the Valley of Elah to his scripts for Million Dollar Baby the Iwo Jima pair and even Casino Royale almost invariably revolve around individuals in extremis and Three Days is no exception. The premise adapted from the 2008 film Anything for Her directed by Fred Cavaye written by Cavaye and Guillaume Lemans and starring Vincent Lindon and Diane Kruger is novel and intriguing as it pivots on the efforts of an unassuming community-college English teacher to figure out how to commit a prison break from the outside. Living in Pittsburgh -- a nearly invisible city in cinema for years but now evidently Hollywoods favorite location on the basis of this and Love amp; Other Drugs and with Unstoppable having been shot nearby -- John (Crowe) and Lara (Elizabeth Banks) Brennan and their 6-year-old son Luke (Ty Simpkins) are doing just fine until Lara is charged with and convicted of a nocturnal parking-lot murder. Deliberately sketchy multiple peeks at the incident leave the question of her guilt entirely open though her coat indisputably had the victims blood on it. Once appeals have been exhausted and Lara has a date with the state pen in three months time John comes to his decision. Inspired by what he takes to be the theme of Don Quixote the book he is teaching (in an English class?) -- ""the triumph of irrationality"" -- the man begins researching his audacious plan by interviewing a former escaped con-turned-author (wonderfully played by Liam Neeson). In the films most compelling minutes this tough old bird plainly lays out the multiple challenges John will face advising him that busting out is easy compared to remaining free and providing essential tips on how long hell have before the encirling net would be sure to ensnare him. In rather less convincing scenes John makes an ill-advised descent into the local underworld to procure fake passports and I.D.s a quest that ultimately puts him at odds with a trigger-happy drug dealer (Kevin Corrigan). These interludes might be intended to teach John street smarts and toughen him up enough to survive life on the run but they play more like obligatory action-movie sequences designed to provoke confrontations and put a weapon in Crowes hand. Bright but a bit plodding John unaccountably puts the fruits of his extensive Internet research up on a wall where anyone who might come in could see it. He also has the occasional playground encounter with a local single mom (Olivia Wilde almost too gorgeous for the mundane circumstances) who could momentarily take Johns mind off his obsession if hed let her. As the date of Laras transfer draws near a major question remains whether shell be inclined to go along with her husbands plot. All the same it moves ahead and its intricacies and unexpected twists are documented coherently if not bracingly by Haggis and his team. For a combination of reasons -- including moderate overlength (133 minutes where no more than two hours were called for) a certain lack of desperation at the core of Crowes performance the want of an unsettling mercurial nature in Banks character that would have really made you wonder about her at times and an uncharacteristically conventional score by Danny Elfman -- the film only rarely rises above the competent. The carpentry of the script is all too evident and the few surprises and kicks reside only in the plotting not at all in the way the film was made. One pretty funny surprise however lies in the identity of the nation John decides to go to if his plot succeeds given that the country in question had to be doubled by a not-entirely-friendly neighbor as an actual shooting location.
