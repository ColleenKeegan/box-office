Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 28 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The first of a proposed trilogy of movies based on Ayn Rands 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged Part 1 comes to the screen after years of delays in time to capitalize on the Tea Party-inspired revival of interest in the right-wing author. An escapee from post-revolutionary Russia Rand held political beliefs have been described as upside-down Marxism Capitalists (a.k.a. ""job creators"") are the heroic producers in society while the workers (and government and unions) are its parasites. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"" based on the novel by Ayn Rand Movies Atlas Shrugged The official trailer As a tribute to the glories of free enterprise Atlas Shrugged is pretty dispiriting. Made on the cheap with no-name stars this is no better than a stilted anachronistic curiosity a low-rent version of the eighties prime-time soap Dallas with the industrial concerns and sexual mores of 1950s all somehow set in 2016. As a liberal-left federal government persists in ruining the economy perky power-flirt heiress and railroad executive Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) struggles to save her company from the predations of various leeches and envious losers. She teams up with a couple of capitalist visionaries - steely-eyed metal magnate Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler) and a big geyser of an oil tycoon Ellis Wyatt (Graham Beckel). Because of the movies low budget were subjected to a succession of interior scenes in offices and at dinner tables where the actors rant about the government and unions and their annoying ""safety"" concerns (""Why all these stupid altruistic urges?"" ask an indignant Dagny). From time to time theres talk of a capitalist messiah named John Galt a shadowy figure in a fedora who is persuading captains of industry to go to his secret hiding place. To be charitable (as much as that might offend Rands legacy) Atlas Shrugged almost gets by as unwitting satire though it would take a director of Alexander Payne or Jason Reitmans satirical skills to do justice to its loopy premise What would happen if all the millionaires went on strike? Would anyone actually notice?

Apart from its deficiencies as fiction whatever its philosophical limitations (the rich and able should only help themselves in Rands ""Objectivism"") the book proves proudly indigestible on film. This is perhaps a fitting tribute to its stubborn writer who scorned The Fountainheads not-terrible adaptation and died (in 1982) while laboring on a TV miniseries script for Atlas Shrugged intended to star her favorite actress Farrah Fawcett. Here doe-eyed mannequin Taylor Schilling portrays railway magnate Dagny Taggart who casts off the shackles of family mediocrity and compromise to lay her own tracks across Colorado. Aided by steel baron Henry Reardon (Grant Bowler) she also pursues the mystery of why societys greatest innovators are suddenly going AWOL. While the world crumbles in economic crisis in the year 2016 with gas at 37.50 a gallon Rands free-market superheroes are fleeing to a mountain compound ruled by ... just who is this John Galt anyway? (Director Paul Johansson and well see more of him in Part II.) Those outside the Rand cult will snicker at the wooden acting cheap effects and constant warnings against wealth redistribution and government regulation (a dog whistle raised to Tea Party ears). But a movie that celebrates high-speed rail constant boozing and adultery cant be all bad. With two recent biographies on Rand (a Russian Jew who escaped to Hollywood then best-sellerdom) hers is the life you want to see filmed not that of her laissez-faire cartoon heroine.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a money line late in Atlas Shrugged Part I where Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) a high-powered executive at a railroad company examines the rubble of a once-promising manufacturing outfit and wonders aloud about the altruistic policies that brought it down. The question is meant to be rhetorical but she sounds a little like a robot in a science-fiction movie asking ""Why do humans cry?"" The concept just doesnt compute. This is the major problem with Atlas Shrugged Part I the first of a proposed three-part adaptation of Ayn Rands 1957 novel Its ideas are squandered by aesthetics. Given the novels centrality to the Tea Party movement which has made ""going Galt"" its call to arms the film is curiously sterile and lifeless hardly the stuff of revolution. It feels more like an ideologically reversed Tucker The Man And His Dream written and performed by robots. Set in 2016 Atlas Shrugged hastily establishes a future in which Middle East wars and dwindling resources have destroyed the economy and once again made trains the most important means of trade and transport. After inheriting Taggart Transcontinental from his father Dagnys brother (Matthew Marsden) and his Washington cronies have run the company into the ground. But she has a plan to save it teaming up with Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler) a rock-ribbed entrepreneur who has devised an awesome new metal that makes conventional steel seem like the rusted tin of a hobos bean can. Their great rail experiment commences in the now-utopian state of Colorado but The Man is working on legislation to shut it down or at least bring it back to an acceptable level of mediocrity. Meanwhile the countrys most productive business leaders are disappearing leaving behind the question ""Who is John Galt?"" Much of Atlas Shrugged takes place in cool modernist office spaces or swank parties and restaurants where the powers that be plot to make the world either a more efficient liberated and profitable place or to maintain the stupidhead status quo. Its almost adorably wonky all the more so for obsessing over trains as the anachronistic beacon of the future and the lead actors Schilling especially deliver their lines like GPS navigators. Perhaps the passion will come in Parts II and III when Voldemort finally makes an appearance but the action in Atlas Shrugged is worse than unconvincing. Its enervating.

Starring Taylor Schilling Edi Gathegi Paul Johansson Michael OKeefe Matthew Marsden Michael Lerner Geoff Pierson Director Paul Johansson Running time 142 Release Opened Apr 15 2011  Editorial Review An adaptation true to the bookBy Mark JenkinsFriday April 15 2011Few novels get the cinematic adaptation they deserve but director Paul Johansson has been fair to Ayn Rands ""Atlas Shrugged"" -- or rather the opening third of it. The first in a proposed trilogy ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"" is nearly as stilted didactic and simplistic as Rands free-market fable.The filmmaker occasionally betrays his muse. Simply by casting flesh-and-blood actors to portray Rands stick-figure characters Johansson softens the story (including one of the authors notoriously severe sex scenes). Consider for example Taylor Schilling as the heroine railroad executive Dagny Taggart. The blond blue-eyed Schilling has a strong chin that gives her a Randian aspect but when she smiles she looks too human for the role.The script also improves on Rand by compressing the narrative. The movie features more than a few inert scenes of industrialists chatter but it moves at a reasonable clip -- although nothing like the 250 mph of Dagnys proposed high-speed train.The bullet-train theme is somewhat ironic. A roaring locomotive is a dynamic image of American industrial power but even in 1957 -- when the book was published -- the future of railroading was in Europe and Asia. And the right-of-center types who revere Rand tend to dismiss public funding for high-speed rail. The filmmakers try to zip past this incongruity by setting ""Atlas Shrugged"" slightly in the future 2016. The price of gasoline is so high that railroads are back in vogue although Dagnys wimpy brother (Matthew Marsden) cant seize the opportunity. Hes the president of Taggart Transcontinental but Dagny outmaneuvers him -- if doing whatever she wants qualifies as ""maneuvering.""Allying with metals magnate Henry Rearden (Grant Bowler) -- soon to become her lover -- and oil baron Ellis Wyatt (Graham Beckel) Dagny rebuilds a decrepit rail line. (""Atlas Shrugged"" contains enough loving glances at track-laying machinery for a CSX promo film.) This is a triumph over the anti-capitalist mischief of the ""Washington men"" personified by Wesley Mouch (Michael Lerner) a lobbyist who becomes the head of a Stalinist-style economic-planning agency.The malignant government isnt Dagny and Henrys only problem though. They also face the disappearance of the worlds greatest entrepreneurs lured away by the mysterious John Galt. More about him in parts two and three (if they ever get made).Rushed into production as the book rights were about to lapse the modestly budgeted film offers competent special effects and performances worthy of a decent TV miniseries. The movie may sometimes confuse viewers unfamiliar with the novel but its not really for them. ""Atlas Shrugged"" is meant for people who have already bought both the book and its message.Contains sexuality and profanity.

Photo In ""Atlas Shrugged"" its 2016 America. The Dow has fallen below 4000 gasoline prices are through the roof and infrastructure is falling apart. High-speed rail looks like the future. Government denounces selfish corporate interests and concerns itself mainly with dividing the dwindling wealth. This isnt loony-bin stuff Attention must be paid. Though a bit stiff in the joints and acted by an undistinguished cast amid TV-movie trappings this low-budget adaptation of Ayn Rands novel nevertheless contains a fire and a fury that makes it more compelling than the average mass-produced studio item. PHOTOS ATLAS SHRUGGED ""Atlas Shrugged"" a mega-fable that is to capitalists roughly what ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is to liberals centers on the struggles of a railroad exec the beautiful and exacting Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) to overhaul a line with a controversial untested new steel alloy produced by an equally arrogant industrialist Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler). Rearden is being forced to sell off his conglomerate bit by bit because of a new law that no one can own more than one business while Taggarts brother (Matthew Marsden) believes the railroads most important source of innovation ought to be collaborating with the government on tightly state-controlled enterprises. The movie covers only the first third of the book and ends on a cliffhanger without fully resolving its central question ""Who is John Galt?"" -- a shadowy figure who seems to be linked to the disappearance of many leading business figures. The subjects the film deals with are fascinating important -- and almost completely ignored at the movies. Even ""The Social Network"" the most acclaimed business movie of last year placed the building of one of the worlds most valuable companies in the background of a personality dispute and some whining about club membership. ""Atlas Shrugged"" wants to start an argument with you to force you to (in Rands often-repeated words) ""check your premises."" It would be easier to do no such thing to laugh off the stilted dialogue and stern unironic hectoring so thats what most viewers will do.

Seldom has a film been so endearingly besotted by the possibilities of flying--its about birds--dancing the samba or hell-for-feather chasing around the skies boulevards back alleys and favelas of Rio de Janeiro. (While the director Carlos Saldanha is Brazilian some of the scruffier citizens of this Rio have Mexican accents.) For a change the 3-D process is indispensable it heightens as well as deepens the kinetic experience. So is the color palette whose ceruleans yellows and crimsons do for the eyes what Tabasco sauce does for the tongue. The production eventually succumbs to motion overload--so many characters darting off in so many directions that the ending turns unfocused even flat. But watching them go by is great fun and there are worse things than a movie that cant stop moving. Watch a clip from the film ""Rio"" courtesy 20TH Century Fox. The birds at the center of the action are a pair of blue macaws voiced by Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway; both performances make the most of witty material. Blus hue is deeper than Jewels but hes still a pale excuse for a confident male and their first encounter is far from love at first flight since Blu doesnt know how to fly. Hes been so thoroughly domesticated by his loving owner Linda (Leslie Mann) that he studies aerodynamics in his cage yet continues to walk around their cozy home in Minnesota until a Brazilian ornithologist named Tulio comes out of nowhere and proposes mating him with the street-smart high-flying Jewel in Rio to save the macaw species. (The script puts wit far ahead of logic although Mr. Saldanha and his co-writer Don Rhymer had the bright comedic idea of shackling Blu and Jewel together like Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in ""The Defiant Ones"" after theyre captured by rare-bird smugglers.) ENLARGE Pedro the cardinal center Rafael the toucan and Nico the canary with macaws Blu left and Jewel in Rio. Courtesy of Blue Sky Studios With memories of ""Saludos Amigos"" ""Black Orpheus"" and Carmen Miranda swirling in my brain I wondered if someone would show up wearing a tropical-fruit headdress and sure enough someone did--a bulldog Luiz whose slobber dangles from his mouth like misplaced pendant earrings. ""Rio"" is densely populated by antic creatures among them a swarm of thieving marmosets a toucan named Rafael and a villainous Aussie cockatoo Nigel who is voiced by Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" and who serves as a sort of bulldog to a smuggler with the black heart of a Bill Sykes. Nigel has a sensational number in which he reveals himself to be an ex-soap opera star who is still embittered by having lost a role to a prettier bird. His song also comes out of nowhere and sets up expectations for more of the same. But no its a one-off flourish in a movie that cant be concerned with consistency. Watching ""Rio"" means living happily in the moment. Atlas Shrugged Part I I wanted to give this movie a fair shake though I cant pretend to be an admirer of Ayn Rands writing. But the movie the first installment of a projected trilogy doesnt give the book a fair shake. In terms of craftsmanship its barely professional except for Taylor Schillings tightly focused performance as Dagny Taggart the heroine trying to keep her railroad company from being destroyed by a government thats hostile to individual achievement. The book was published in 1957 yet the clumsiness of this production makes it seem antediluvian even though the story has been shifted to a near future when gasoline is 37.50 a gallon the capitalist system is in ruins and gifted people who might save it are mysteriously vanishing leaving only the mediocrities Rand detested. If ever there was an effective way to bring this sprawling didactic material to the screen--King Vidors 1949 version of ""The Fountainhead"" was enjoyable for its extravagant style--the director Paul Johansson and the writers John Aglialoro and Brian Patrick OToole havent found it. Dont hold your breath for parts 2 and 3. The Conspirator Mary Surratt the first woman executed by the U.S. government was convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In this courtroom drama adapted by James D. Solomon from the trial transcripts shes played by Robin Wright with a look of glazed rectitude that was once the exclusive province of Anne Revere. It isnt her fault though. Like most other members of an excellent cast that includes James McAvoy Kevin Kline and Tom Wilkinson she has come under the deadening directorial hand of Robert Redford. ""The Conspirator"" suggests that Mary was punished for crimes committed by her son. It also suggests a parallel between Marys plight--she was tried in a military tribunal rather than a civil court--and the plight of the Guantanamo prisoners. What it most suggests though is the sort of classroom film that has kept generations of students off the edge of their seats.

Taylor Schilling plays a railroad tycoon facing tough times in ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"" based on the 1957 Ayn Rand best-seller. Photo Rocky Mountain Pictures Atlas Shrugged Part 1 review A dystopian tale 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Atlas Shrugged Part I Drama. Starring Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler. Directed by Paul Johansson. (PG-13. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The year is 2016. The Middle East has imploded. Gas is 37 a gallon. The U.S. government in an attempt to contain the crisis has only made things worse controlling the economy with an iron fist not only with wage and price controls but with punitive taxes and laws that discourage competition. Yes its a bad time to be a great businessman or a person of genius. Adapted from the novel by Ayn Rand ""Atlas Shrugged Part I"" is a low-budget film with more than a whiff of amateurism in its writing and direction. The story (unless you know the book well) is almost impossible to follow and often you can feel both the presence of the camera and the directors abandonment of the actors. Yet the story a dystopian tale with heroes and villains and lots of triumphs and reversals is so busy and so inherently interesting that the movie is entertaining until the finish - or the sort of finish. As only the first part of the story ""Atlas Shrugged"" doesnt end it stops. Yes its a right-wing diatribe. It presents liberals from a conservative point of view as meddlers and mediocrities who resent fear and aim to keep down the talented and the visionary. Its misunderstanding of the liberal mind is ridiculous and unfair and yet no more so than the liberal misunderstanding of the conservative mind which we sometimes see even in lauded films such as ""American Beauty."" Still a diatribe preaching only to the happily ignorant is no selling point. Related Stories Atlas Shrugged Part 1 What is a selling point are the boldly drawn characters played by a cast of unknowns some of whom deserve to be known. Im thinking in particular of Taylor Schilling as Dagny Taggart a railway heiress and Grant Bowler as Hank Rearden a manufacturing magnate and the inventor of Rearden Metal. Even with director Paul Johansson practically missing in action giving them nothing Schilling and Bowler are forceful and attractive. Id be willing to sit through Part 2 right now. -- Advisory Sex but no nudity. Lots of opportunities for cursing but somehow no one does.

I arched eyebrow scrunched forehead yawned.The first installment of the planned three-part series adapted from the 1957 epic by Ayn Rand philosopher and romance novelist of free-market capitalism is speechy and preachy and just a teeny-weeny bit naughty.In acting and art direction it resembles a lost episode of Dynasty the Aaron Spelling prime-time soap opera so irresistible during the Reagan era.In ideology it is a long-winded celebration of the free market and a condemnation of big government noticeably short on the stew of sex and self-interest that makes other Rand adaptations (We the Living The Fountainhead) entertaining for those who do not share her political views.It is set in 2016 in an America thats a runaway train on the track to ruin. Evil and good are as starkly black-and-white as a penguin.The nation is in crisis its infrastructure crumbling the national debt skyrocketing. Homeless encampments proliferate. Gas is 37.50 a gallon oil spills despoil the coasts lobbyists hold Washington in their sweaty grip.For Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) the glamorous principal of Taggart Transcontinental rail the question isnt ""Who will save America?"" but ""Who is John Galt?"" Is he the mystery man abducting the men who make the country work?Before she can investigate that question Dagny literally has to get her company back on track after several derailments.While her brother wants to play by Washington rules Dagny purposefully retrofits tracks with a new lightweight steel manufactured in Philadelphia by Henry Rearden (Grant Bowler) for high-speed rail. In a scene sure to win some chuckles locally Henry walks home from his Center City factory to what looks like a suburban Tara.Schilling the new-model Diane Kruger is an attractive blonde who puts some tigress in this movies low tank. But either shes not much of an actress or rookie filmmaker Paul Johansson isnt much of a director.With the notable exception of Jon Polito the acting is strictly from Stepford. Admittedly lines such as ""Im cultivating a society that honors individual achievement"" and ""Businesses die because people are paid by need not ability"" dont exactly roll off the tongue.Still to paraphrase the film if youre weary of a government that exercises too much control over you Atlas Shrugged Part I preaches to the choir.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Its politics are the least of the hurdles for ""Atlas Shrugged the movie.About to lose his long-held rights to Ayn Rands novel and perhaps to cash in on apparent Tea Party interest and support producer John Aglialoro (the CEO of Cybex International in Medway) rushed this film into a low-budget production and it shows in every frame. Even fans of Rands 1957 antigovernment manifesto may balk at having to endure dialogue that would be banal on the Lifetime channel along with wooden performances particularly from Taylor Schilling as rail tycoon Dagny Taggart and a tedious plot that reduces political and high finance machinations to boring dinner table patter. To make matters worse this is merely part one covering just the first third of Rands opus.""Atlas Shrugged Part 1 is set in 2016 but people still get breaking news from a fictional Fox-like cable station and -- heartening for some of us -- newspapers are still sold in vending machines. Wealthy industrialist Henry Reardon (Grant Bowler) joins forces with like-minded entrepreneur Taggart to bring a high-speed train through Colorado despite government attempts to thwart their ingenuity. Meanwhile billionaire CEOs are vanishing as a shadowy man in a hat trench coat and Dark Knight rasp (director Paul Johansson doing double duty) arrives at their doors.Taggart is shocked when the government quickly passes a law aimed at curtailing competition in business. But that record-breaking speed is nothing compared with the ease with which she launches the John Galt Line on rails made with Reardons new super-strong metal. When a union head storms into her office to complain that the new rails havent been tested for safety Taggart counters that workers should be happy shes providing jobs and whether to work or not is their choice. This being a simplistic tale of visionary capitalists and the weaklings who get in their way of course the train is safe. It barrels though scenic Oregon at 250 miles per hour. Triumphant Taggart and the married Reardon celebrate with champagne and soft-core sex.Refusing to let the interfering government stop them Taggart and Reardon head to the abandoned 20th Century Motor Co. in Wisconsin. A small engine that runs on atmospheric electricity is surprise still sitting on a dusty shelf like a grade-schoolers abandoned science project. Were expected to believe that Taggart an engineering major and business tycoon who refuses to kowtow to unions would react to the mysterious demise of the forward-thinking company by whining ""Why all these stupid altruistic urges? Its not being charitable or fair. What is it with people today?Schilling posits that query with the same lack of urgency with which she asks ""Who is John Galt? the enigmatic phrase that aims to be the films ""Rosebud. But with a plot devoid of suspense and characters without complexity Rands iconic line elicits merely a yawn or a shrug.Loren King can be reached at loren.kingcomcast.net.

Atlas Shrugged Part I Bomb to bad Director Paul Johansson Cast Taylor Schilling Paul Johansson and Michael OKeefe Rating PG-13 for some sexuality. Based on bestsellers Guide to this weeks new releases Ayn Rands Atlas Shrugged hits the big screen They should have waited longer. The acting is so poor and the story so badly told that the viewers feelings about Rands novel - an epic ode to free-market fundamentalism - are almost immaterial (though if youre a devoted fan youll perhaps be more forgiving). This is the first of a planned trilogy - Rands book is split into three parts making the delineation easy - but if ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"" is any indication dont hold your breath for Parts 2 and 3. The film takes place in 2016 in a dystopian United States. An expository scene explains why railroads have once again become the main mode of transportation - good thing since the film like the book centers on the rail industry. Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) runs Taggart Transcontinental the largest railroad company left. Shes independent determined to run the company on her own terms - unlike her brother James (Matthew Marsden) who is a tool of government toadies and special-interest dopes drawn comically broad. They conspire to suppress individual creativity and success pushing through legislation in favor of something that sounds an awful lot like - gasp - communism. They want to cripple Henry Reardon (Grant Bowler) whose company has come up with a new better steel that would be perfect for railroad tracks. James is aghast at doing business with Reardon but Dagny is drawn to his ideas his integrity his . . . oh those dreamy eyes. Dreamy something They are clearly meant for each other in the most obvious of movie ways. In addition to her business problems Dagny faces another challenge Several key people in her company and in other industries have gone missing. And everyone keeps asking ""Who is John Galt?"" Hes actually director Paul Johansson though hes seen only in shadows and from behind a fedora masking his features. We find out who he is sort of but one presumes that his identity and his mission are more fully spelled out in the second and third installments. Other key characters from the book are also here including Ellis Wyatt (Graham Beckel) an oil tycoon and Francisco DAnconia (Jsu Garcia) a hard-partying playboy who seems intent on squandering his familys fortune. As the title suggests its very much a Part 1 type of story though its told in such an uninspired way - stirring music doesnt equal stirring emotion - that its difficult to imagine anyone waiting for the next two installments with bated breath. The dialogue is wooden the delivery of it practically petrified. Its all black-and-white no nuance. ""Why all these stupid altruistic urges?"" Dagny whines to Reardon. ""Its not being charitable or fair. What is it with people today?"" What indeed? Schilling isnt nearly a strong-enough actor to impart the steely resolve Dagny requires. Marsden is worse almost laughable as he sits between Michael Lerner and Jon Polito cooking up schemes to keep Taggart Transcontinental relevant. The desire to shoo him back to the kids table is powerful. The desire to care about him his company or most of the rest of the people in the film is not. Bowler is kind of interesting as Reardon but like everyone else here hes so deadly serious you practically beg for a smile out of the guy - out of someone. ""Atlas Shrugged Part I"" is a dismal affair so really guys no hurry with the next one. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Flatly rendered Rand classic is taxing indeed - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Flatly rendered Rand classic is taxing indeedAtlas Shrugged Part 1 a 1 starApril 14 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe tinhorn film version of ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"" fails to rise even to the level of ""eh"" suggested by Ayn Rands title. But with so little going on in cinematic or storytelling terms we can cut straight to the fascinating tea-stained politics of the thing. Conceived as the first of a proposed three-part series director Paul Johanssons movie is the work of true believers in Rands pet theory known as Objectivism which can be described as ""Us? There is no us"" In Rands worldview its me-time all the time. The capitalistic visionaries among us have been hounded and taxed and ground down so relentlessly by the federal government and other societal evils theres nothing to do but blow the whole thing up and start anew in a civilization run by the mysterious John Galt who respects the rapacious dog-eat-dog nature of humankind and the sexy life-enhancing virtues of unfettered economic competition. Published in 1957 Rands novel has been championed over the decades by noteworthy governmental and media figureheads ranging from Alan Greenspan to Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and the loosely defined tea party millions currently exercising considerable influence in American politics will find much in Rands story to stoke their righteous wrath. As adapted dutifully if flatly by screenwriters Brian Patrick OToole and John Aglialoro the movie deploys Rands code words and phrases like little bombs. Each time one of Rands noble warriors -- industrialists inventors plus a craven lobbyist or federal-payroll slacker for moral contrast -- mutters something about ""federal tax"" or ""public funding"" or the uselessness of altruism its like a call to arms. There is a woman at the zinclike heart of it all the railroad company magnate Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling bland as water). She becomes one with the mighty steel company genius Henry Rearden (Grant Bowler no less watery). As adapted here Rands dialogue is full of come-ons such as ""Dagny what were doing -- my metal your railway..."" Rand set her version of events simultaneously in the robber-baron past and the science fiction future. The movie plunks the tale down in an oil-strapped 2016. This world is delivered visually with zero atmosphere or sense of energy. Without any melodramatic zing in its corner when Rearden greets his ""depraved playboy"" nemesis and sexual rival with ""Your reputation precedes you Senor dAnconia"" the line like so many others dies a tragic little death. At least with the 1949 version of ""The Fountainhead"" you had the sense of actors clawing their way through Rands philosophy toward a human feeling or two. Director King Vidor certainly held up his end; the expressionist zap and noir-inflected imagery in ""The Fountainhead"" is peerlessly bizarre. Not here. This movie is crushingly ordinary in every way which with Rand I wouldnt have thought possible. mjphillipstribune.com Twitter phillipstribune MPAA rating PG-13 (for some sexuality) Cast Taylor Schilling (Dagny Taggart); Grant Bowler (Henry Rearden); Matthew Marsden (James Taggart); Graham Beckel (Ellis Wyatt); Michael Lerner (Wesley Mouch) Credits Directed by Paul Johansson; written by Brian Patrick OToole and John Aglialoro based on the novel by Ayn Rand; produced by Harmon Kaslow and Aglioloro.

Daily Edition Login to download Atlas Shrugged Review 102 PM PDT 4/7/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Flubbed under-produced representation of the first third of Ayn Rands still controversial novel bodes ill for parts two and three. TWITTER The independently financed-and-distributed rendition of the books first third is unlikely to generate sufficient box office to inspire production of the final two installments. ""There were a few rare men of talent around her but they were becoming rarer every year"" it is lamented about the circle surrounding Ayn Rands ultra-capable heroine Dagny Taggart in Atlas Shrugged and the complaint certainly applies in the case of this botched partial screen adaptation of the mammoth novel that has materialized 54 years after the books publication. Although the recent surge in annual sales of the revered and despised authors fictional manifesto arguably testifies to its continuing relevance the central battle between fearsomely independent corporate mavericks and hostile big government has been updated in a half-baked unconvincing way thats exacerbated by button-pushing TV-style direction threadbare production values and blah performances except for that of Taylor Schilling in the central role. Set to bow in roughly 200 theaters on April 15 this independently financed-and-distributed rendition of the books first third is unlikely to generate sufficient box office to inspire production of the final two installments (the 1000-plus-page novel is divided into three sections of 10 chapters apiece) although the producers could conceivably forge ahead anyway if their pockets are deep enough. A TV miniseries with a high-powered cast--several were planned at various points over the past four decades--would have been a preferable way to go with this didactic sometimes risible but still powerful material. Published in 1957 Rands summation novel continues to compel and repel; designed as a paean and exhortation to fulfillment of personal excellence and unrestrained industrial productivity it is also seen as an abject endorsement of wanton selfishness and the right of the capable few to lord it over the parasitical many. Especially as former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had been an ardent Randian its recently become easier than ever to blame contemporary economic ills on the fallout from her unregulated philosophy even if the fiscal blundering of many governments provides equally persuasive arguments on the other side. These philosophical debates can and will go on forever but screenwriters Brian Patrick OToole and John Aglialoro (also a producer) have themselves bungled in their attempt to remain faithful to the letter of the sacred text while moving the action to the near-future (specifically 2016). Many scenes are devoted to dull conversations among business fatcats about the economics of railways and steel central industries that helped drive the nation 60 years ago but seem like afterthoughts today (Amtrak anyone?). Updating the story would provide a provocative test to any writer but could certainly be done; however to do so without acknowledging the present-day realities of high-tech industries outsourcing shifting transportation modes and advanced information technology (the characters here actually read newspapers) places the action in an unrecognizable twilight zone. So does the fact that the central manufacturing triumph here is the construction of a high-speed train (managed from scratch within a few months no less). Not only is it unremarked that Asia and Europe are decades ahead on this front but conservatives who might be perceived as the core audience for this film are the very ones currently fighting against fast-train funding and construction in the U.S. For these reasons alone a serious cultural/historical disjunction derails the enterprise from the outset. Television news clips portray a nation in recognizable disarray and decay as well as a Middle East that has imploded triggering unimaginable oil prices but these seem like overwhelming issues unlikely to be turned around by the efforts of the laser-focused Dagny to take over decision-making at rail giant Taggart Transcontinental from her ineffectual brother James (Matthew Marsden). Poised beautifully groomed and impeccably coiffed Dagny strides through the corridors of male hesitation indecision and ineffectuality with a fierce confidence shaken only by the inexplicable ""retirement"" of certain skilled executives and the baffling question she increasingly hears at unexpected moments ""Who is John Galt?"" This is a query that may or may not ever be answered onscreen depending upon whether the next two parts are made but suffice it to say that in Part I he is a shadowy figure resembling the Humphrey Bogart character in Woody Allens ""Play It Again Sam."" Galt is impersonated here by Paul Johansson a young actor who stepped in to direct Atlas Shrugged when the original director left shortly before shooting began. The best that can be said for his work is that its perfunctory a word that also describes all the performances except that of Schilling a blond beauty whose open face direct gaze and plain speaking do more than anything else to make watching the film tolerable. One has little doubt that in a more substantial version of this story one populated by strong actors in the other principal roles she would have held her own and moreso justifying the casting of a relative unknown in the most important part. Although ostensibly set in New York City the film features various buildings and cityscapes recognizable from Los Angeles and Chicago. Opens April 15 (Strike Prods.

A monument of American literature is shaved down to a spindly toothpick of a movie in ""Atlas Shrugged"" a project that reportedly once caught the eye of Angelina Jolie Faye Dunaway and Clint Eastwood. Part one of a trilogy that may never see completion this hasty low-budget adaptation would have Ayn Rand spinning in her grave considering how it violates the authors philosophy by allowing opportunists to exploit anothers creative achievement -- in this case hers. Targeting roughly 200 screens pic goes out hitched to a grassroots marketing campaign hoping to break-even via by-popular-demand bookings and potential Tea Party support. Rather than lose the rights to Rands novel producer John Aglialoro enlisted co-writer Brian Patrick OToole dashed off a screenplay and rushed the project into production. Made with the permission but not the participation of the Rand estate the result cuts corners in every respect. Rather than try to condense everything into a tight two-hour feature Aglialoro and fellow producer Harmon Kaslow tackle the books first third only hiring relatively inexperienced helmer Paul Johansson (originally tapped to play John Galt the shadowy trenchcoat-wearing figure seen cornering billionaires in back alleys) to deliver their vision after Stephen Polk was fired. Imagining what might happen if the worlds thought leaders suddenly went on strike leaving the hangers-on to fend for themselves Rands epic undertaking actually subdivides nicely considering the author herself organized ""Atlas Shrugged"" into three 10-chapter parts. This opening segment lays out a decidedly uncinematic economic scenario in which government regulators pick at the achievements of leading industrialists citing the publics best interest as they undermine the progress of societys most successful entrepreneurs with anti-competition and spread-the-wealth statutes. With neither the time nor the budget to find appropriate matches to play the political and big-business titans who populate the plot Aglialoro settled for an ensemble of unfamiliar thesps the most recognizable of whom are character actors Michael Lerner and Jon Polito (both of ""Barton Fink"" fame). Rand fans have spent decades fantasy-casting the role of Dagny Taggart the tough-as-nails railroad tycoon who serves as ""Atlas Shruggeds"" primary earth mover only to see her remade as a generic business-suit Barbie unassertively played by pretty blonde TV actress Taylor Schilling (NBCs ""Mercy""). At its core ""Atlas Shrugged"" is a romance between Dagny and fellow business leader Henry ""Hank"" Rearden (Grant Bowler) whose visionary formula for a stronger lighter form of steel promises to transform the nations economy. While their shared passion -- for one another for innovation for winning -- gives the story an intimate focus Hanks metal and Dagnys rails also form the backbone of a big-picture view of American industry something beyond the scope of the films limited budget. Since boardroom chats and business dinners are more affordable to shoot than flashbacks and setpieces ""Atlas Shrugged"" becomes a series of polite policy conversations interrupted by Fox News-style updates whenever exposition is called for as in a long prologue that unnecessarily explains why a story re-set in 2016 still relies so heavily on railroad travel. But even this stuffy shut-in approach would be reasonable if only the dialogue crackled and the tempers flared from time to time as they do on nearly every one of Rands 1200 pages. The films rare exception a faceoff between Dagny and playboy Francisco DAnconia (Jsu Garcia) makes little sense without the ex-lovers torrid backstory. The impecunious producers do manage a few key railroad-rebuilding exteriors and wisely commission visual effects for the new lines virgin run as well as the films climactic oil-well fires. But what the film really needs is suspense not spectacle -- some indication of where the story is headed so auds have reason to engage. Even Rands iconic question ""Who is John Galt?"" cant supply much mystery to a plot in which the mysterious characters presence is barely felt. More ambitious sound design and score rather than the low-key filler from composer Elia Cmiral and music supervisor Steve Weisberg might have significantly boosted the pics limited scale. For the record the onscreen title reads ""Atlas Shrugged"" sans any ""Part I"" delineation.
