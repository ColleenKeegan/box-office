Actually ""drama"" overstates the case Robert Redford directs and also plays a liberal university professor who urges his best student (an utterly charmless Andrew Garfield) to devote himself to doing good in the world. While hes doing that a skeptical TV interviewer (Meryl Streep) sits in a Washington office grilling a conservative senator (Tom Cruise) about the next step in the war on terrorism -- even as that next step is playing out grimly for two U.S. soliders (Derek Luke and Michael Pena) atop a mountain in Afghanistan. Cruise snarky and vaguely reptilian is the only one who comes off very well though its hard to blame the performers Theyre being ambushed by an expository painfully implausible script every time it rounds a plot twist.

"Lions for Lambs | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lions-for-lambs ) Lions for Lambs (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Lions for Lambs is one of those movies in which the principals talk a lot but dont say much. The film is built not upon characters and plot but upon ideas. That would be fine if the ideas were revolutionary or interesting but theyre fairly commonplace. At its heart this is an anti-war movie but unlike other films existing in this growing genre it doesnt pretend that the current situation is a series of black-and-white discrete instances. It acknowledges the grays. The problem is aside from some okay performances by high-profile talent theres nothing worth watching going on here. Its surprising that a director of Robert Redfords undeniable skill has made such a bland and somnambulant motion picture. The movie follows three plot lines that have hooks into one another. In the first injured soldiers Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke) are caught in a firefight in the mountains of Afghanistan. Cut off from their unit they are trapped in the icy wasteland with snow falling and the enemy closing in. Meanwhile in Washington D.C. the architect of the ""new strategy"" that has placed Rodriguez and Finch in their dire situation Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) is engaged in a one-on-one sitdown with journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep). His goal is to use her to sell the plan and shes feeling cheaper than a two-bit whore. Finally at a California university Professor Stephen Malley (Redford) who counted Rodriguez and Finch among his most gifted students last year is arguing life and responsibility with his latest ""fine young mind"" the cynical and unmotivated Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield). So Cruise and Streep talk Redford and Garfield argue and Pena and Luke lie in the freezing snow trying not to get shot by the Taliban. A movie like Lions for Lambs needs to do at least one of two things get us to care about the characters or give us enough intellectually stimulating material that our identification with them is not necessary. It does neither. One wonders whether Redford and screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan (who also penned The Kingdom) thought they were making some telling points. But their ""revelations"" such as the mass medias collusion with the political establishment in selling the invasion of Iraq are neither groundbreaking nor compelling. The acting is fine although there are no performances here that will shout out for Oscar nominations. Tom Cruise exudes charisma as a preacher of Republican pro-war slogans. The key here is that the character really believes what hes selling and that makes him a passionate spokesperson. Streep reaches into her bag of characters and pulls out a mousey one who would fit in nicely with all those middle-aged women who are on a first-name basis with the President at his press conferences. Robert Redford the third member of the high profile trio appears to be playing someone whos not all that different from the actor/director - a low-key liberal professor. Im not convinced theres a lot of acting needed for this part. The longer the movie runs (fortunately its shorter than the average Redford film or no one would be awake at the end) the more it seems that Lions for Lambs is trying to baffle us with b.s. One has to applaud the actors ability to memorize lines because there are a lot of them. The Afghanistan war sequences which are intended to inject life into the otherwise wordy proceedings are presented in such a lackluster manner that they seem more like filler than a crucial leg of the plots tripod. Redford has never shown himself to be adept at action sequences and this deficiency is evident here. Maybe the problem with Lions for Lambs is that its behind the curve. Perhaps three years ago it might have seemed fresh and interesting but information has come out and opposition to the war has grown. Now the movie seems like its re-hashing familiar territory rather than plowing new ground. Redford is known to be a slow deliberate worker (his last movie as a director was seven years ago). In this instance that trait may have hurt him. In many ways Lions for Lambs may have more going for it than any of this eras crop of anti-war films but it ultimately fares no better than the least of them. Its pitfalls may be different but the result is the same its not entertaining educational or effective.

Lions for Lambs All lamb no lion | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLions for Lambs All lamb no lionThere is much talk of paralysis in Robert Redfords whats-wrong-with-America movie Lions for Lambs  and there is a whole lot of the same in the movie itself.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Nov. 9 2007 (out of 4)Starring Robert Redford Meryl Streep Tom Cruise Michael Pena and Peter Berg. Written by Matthew Michael Carnahan. Directed by Robert Redford. 88 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued Below There is much talk of paralysis in Robert Redfords whats-wrong-with-America movie Lions for Lambs and there is a whole lot of the same in the movie itself.A lumpy ill-dramatized and ultimately enervating liberal op-ed piece flailing for dramatic purchase this steroid-inflated Sundance workshop may prove most effective as a demonstration (as opposed to an antidote) of the political desperation that hamstrings the American middle-left. Written by Matthew Michael Carnahan whose script for the recent The Kingdom did a vastly more effective job at translating political ideas into action-movie language Lions for Lambs unfolds as a series of three ostensibly interdependent conversations.One pits Meryl Streeps veteran Judith Miller-like reporter Janine Roth against Tom Cruises hawkish Republican Sen. Jasper Irving while another sees a complacent poli-sci student (Andrew Garfield) being summoned to the office of the Vietnam-vet professor Stephen Malley (Redford) for a one-on-one lecture on the dangers of smug non-involvement.Finally there is the movies most inadvertently campy and jaw-droppingly misconceived sequence in which an idealistic African-American soldier (Derek Luke) and his Hispanic best friend (Michael Pena) both former students of Malleys find themselves falling from a helicopter into deepest Taliban territory in mountainous Afghanistan. The larger backdrop here is Bushs catastrophic 21st-century foreign policy an incalculably grim situation the movie correctly identifies as the result of a number of equally culpable agencies a media far more interested in entertaining and profiting than enlightening or challenging; a culture far more engineered toward consumption than action and a political system that cynically lets ends dictate means no matter how many may die in the spin cycle. While any one of these ideas (familiar though they may be) might provide ample fodder for an involving drama the most striking thing about Lions for Lambs is just how uninvolving and non-dramatic it is. (Compare this for instance to a movie like Michael Clayton in which a similarly bleak 21st-century worldview is smartly rendered as a riveting noir-ish character study.)From the inorganic parallel structure that keeps slamming us from one conversation to the other to the presumption behind the conversations (that telling is somehow more urgent than showing) Redfords movie is astonishingly naive like something made by someone whos recently woken from a seven-year coma and found themselves transfixed in horror by CNN.Earnest uninspiring redundant and condescending (especially in its minority politics) Lions for Lambs may ultimately serve its most noble purpose in a hopefully more reasonable future when people are desperately trying to figure out just how out of touch the alleged opposition to Bushworld actually was. The answer if this movie can be taken as any indication is very out of touch indeed.

As entertainment Lions whimpers rather than roars - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs As entertainment Lions whimpers rather than roars Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY It is easy to admire Lions for Lambs (  1/2 out of four) for what it is trying to achieve but as executed it feels talky and medicinal. A film built around a discussion of the state of American life needs to sustain sharp dialogue. Instead Lions pontificates. Though characters make some strong points the film feels preachy and falls flat as entertainment. MAP Where in the world has Tom Cruise been to promote Lions? CLIP USA TODAYs exclusive look at Redfords film Robert Redford directs and stars as a professor trying to incite intellectual fervor in a cocky but promising student (Andrew Garfield). In a one-on-one lecture in his office he lauds the bravery of two former students (Derek Luke and Michael Pena) who enlisted for combat. The film intercuts among a wide-ranging ideological discussion scenes of a covert mission in Afghanistan involving the former students and an overly long exchange between a veteran reporter (Meryl Streep) interviewing a Republican senator (Tom Cruise). Streep is low-key while Cruise is slickly persuasive as the opportunistic politician. The film takes on key targets politicians of all stripes journalists academia an apathetic public. Kudos to Redford for trying to inspire activism or just get people talking. Though these dialogues are worthy the medium doesnt seem right for the message.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 9 2007 1159 AM Lions for Lambs Cruise-Redford-Streep in an earnest post-9/11 melodrama. By Dana Stevens Tom Cruise in Lions for Lambs Just when you thought that Rendition had nailed this years award for most dramatically inert post-9/11 melodrama along comes Lions for Lambs (United Artists/MGM) the Robert Redford-directed Tom Cruise-executive-produced star vehicle that ought to have been called Slugs for Snails so leisurely does it creep toward its predictably bombastic conclusion. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. As you sit through the films 88 eternal minutes you have to keep reminding yourself that Redford has been directing films some of them pretty good for nearly 30 years now. Yet Lions for Lambs appears to have been created by someone whos never seen one of these newfangled contraptions called ""movies"" or for that matter witnessed that phenomenon known as ""speech."" Everyone in the movie talks incessantly--essentially the film is a record of three simultaneous conversations taking place across the globe--but not a line of dialogue sounds like something that anyone has ever actually said. After a while the scripts denatured quality takes on a fascination of its own Just how does this earnest well-intentioned movie crammed to the rafters with talent manage to feel so thoroughly phony? Advertisement In static yammerfest No. 1 Sen. Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) offers TV journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) an ""exclusive"" interview thats a barely disguised press release about the administrations latest military push in Afghanistan. Meanwhile at an unnamed California university idealistic history professor Stephen Malley (Redford) chews out bright but underachieving student Todd (Andrew Garfield) by telling him the story of two ex-students from the inner city who enlisted for military service in a burst of patriotic fervor. Finally in a helicopter somewhere over Afghanistan we meet those two students Eric Rodriguez and Arian Finch (Michael Pena and Derek Luke). After the ill-conceived mission goes wrong they wind up half-buried in the snow on a mountainside waiting for rescue as the Taliban closes in. The net effect for the viewer is that of being trapped in an airless room then escaping it to find yourself in another and yet another. Youd think at least the boots-on-the-ground subplot would provide some forward motion but each time were released from the senators chambers or the professors book-lined office to rejoin the two soldiers damned if theyre not still waist-deep in snow where theyll remain sharing pep talks and flashbacks for the majority of the film. Meryl Streep tries to bring her ""A"" game to the scenes with Cruise throwing in speech tics and bits of business to give her character some heft. But both politician and journalist are such cutouts (he spouts about the axis of evil she sighs disapprovingly and scribbles on her pad) that they might as well be debating on Meet the Press. Cruise gets one juicy moment that recalls Jack Nicholsons iconic ""You want me on that wall. You need me on that wall"" speech in A Few Good Men. But he throws away the chance to embody the passion of the true believer; he never lets us forget that hes only pretending to be Republican. The screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan also wrote the recent The Kingdom a crude revenge-on-the-terrorists fantasy that nonetheless reads like sophisticated policy analysis next to Lions for Lambs. (Both movies do end on similar notes hinting unsubtly that the next generation will be doomed to repeat the violence of the last.) Redford keeps cutting away to clocks as the professors office hour the senators interview and the soldiers hour of peril chug toward their respective ends. The unintended consequence is that you find yourself trying to match the real-time proceedings onscreen with the real time ticking away on your watch and counting the seconds till you can go home. Lions for Lambs will no doubt be ridiculed for its pie-in-the-sky leftism but the movies view of American politics is muddled and at times cynical. Streeps character stands in for ""the media"" apparently an undifferentiated mass of cowardly suckups churning out glowing profiles of the power elite. Malley regrets his former students decision to enlist but his dewy-eyed praise of their courage along with his vague exhortations to ""get involved"" understandably inspire the frat-boy slacker to consider signing up himself. And when Todd asks his teacher why he should spend his life trying to make the world better when it probably wont make a difference Malleys response is a wan ""At least you can say you did something."" Now theres a rallying cry Have we really sunk so far into post-Reagan anomie and liberal self-loathing that even a college professor played by Robert Redford isnt allowed a moment of good old-fashioned hope?

Directed by Redford from a screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan. 88 minutes. Rated R for some war violence and language. Several theaters. When a filmmaker directs himself in a role thats hopelessly dull is that professional suicide or just kindness in not burdening some other actor with the part? Robert Redford in his well-intentioned but uneven ""Lions for Lambs"" plays a college professor determined to light a fire under a promising but slacking-off student (Andrew Garfield). In his book-littered office he rails at the kid about apathy about willful ignorance about making a difference in the world. The camera gets in close as the lecture goes on (interspersed with two other stories) throughout the movies entire running time in seemingly endless variation. And while everything the character says is perfectly admirable Redford (both the actor and the director) cant find a way to make it dramatic or even interesting. College kids dont enjoy being preached at; movie audiences generally dont either. And thats where ""Lions for Lambs"" despite its strong cast stumbles. The film scripted by Matthew Michael Carnahan (and strangely brief at 88 minutes) has a clear point of view raising questions about the war on terror the nations long presence in Iraq and the medias seeming complicity in presenting the White House agenda. ""If you dont stand for something you might fall for anything"" the films posters read. ""Lions for Lambs"" clearly stands for something but it doesnt do enough to make that stance intriguing; or say much that those concerned about these issues havent already considered. Structured more like a play than a film ""Lions for Lambs"" features three slightly interrelated stories happening on the same day the professor on his California campus; a journalist (Meryl Streep) interviewing a senator (Tom Cruise) in D.C. about a possible new war strategy; and two young soldiers (Derek Luke Michael Pena) former students of Redfords character facing danger in Afghanistan. We get virtually no backstory on any of these people; this film is not about character but about politics and symbols. And only one of the stories has any resonance that of Streep and Cruise who turn out to be a surprisingly wily team. (For those hoping for an ""Out of Africa"" reunion Alas Streep and Redford have no scenes together here.) Cruises ultrasmooth performance as a photogenic young Republican politico seemed oddly familiar -- until it struck me that Id seen it before in person when I interviewed the actor a few years ago. This isnt a criticism of Cruises work in the film which is eerily believable but an illustration of how much politicians have in common with movie stars particularly when they speak to the press. Cruises presence here is that of a man effortlessly donning a cloak of smiling charm in order to sell a product -- in this case the latest war strategy. Streep as a veteran TV journalist isnt buying. Shes smart skeptical and a little tired; she knows the senator is using her and keeps her eyebrows delicately raised like radar. In their interview the two warily circle each other each knowing more than he or she is telling. Its a fascinating little movie-within-the-movie; too bad it ultimately drowns in the films sea of words.

Robert Redford Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise. Directed by Robert Redford. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) The lions are the soldiers who do the fighting. The lambs are the unworthy politicians who send them into battle. And ""Lions for Lambs"" the latest from director Robert Redford is a feature-film response to the war in Iraq and to currents in post-9/11 American life. This is no perfect work of art but neither is a report from the front. Its strengths are the strengths of journalism not the strengths of say a Tolstoy novel. Its a fictional tale that has the immediacy of something hot off the presses - something raw and clunky but plugged into the moment - with characters talking about the same things people are talking about outside the theater. Maybe ""Lions for Lambs"" will date badly or maybe its something people will value as a time capsule. Its impossible to say but for the time being this is responsive engaged filmmaking the kind of movie they say Americans dont make. It takes place in three locations and depicts events happening concurrently. In the Middle East two young Army rangers are injured and stranded behind the lines in Afghanistan. Meanwhile in Washington an ambitious young senator (Tom Cruise) unveils his new Middle East strategy to a television reporter (Meryl Streep). And in California a political science professor (Robert Redford) tries to convince a gifted student not to devote his life to money and pleasure but to enter public service. With this setup much of ""Lions for Lambs"" consists of two-person conversations. The least urgent and the most programmatic of the conversations is the one between the professor and the student. Theres nothing really much at stake - something about Andrew Garfield as the student makes us not believe in the young man as much as the professor does - and at times Matthew Michael Carnahans screenplay creaks with piety. But those scenes work anyway because Redford is in them bringing all his skill and history not to mention a quality that suggests that if he says it it must be true. But the real action comes in the scenes between the senator and the journalist. Redford who has done more than his share of interviews captures the nature of the dynamic. The interviewer watches and tries not to reveal anything while the interviewee performs charms and flatters while maintaining a discreet air of superiority. Its a cat-and-mouse game in which each participant vies to be the cat though the cold-blooded nature of the exchange is covered over by a veneer of ease and friendliness. Tom Cruise as a senator? Isnt he like 28 or something? Actually hes 45 the same age Jack Kennedy was during the Cuban missile crisis and Cruises basic screen personality provides him with the perfect aura to play a political up-and-comer Hes charismatic gloriously self-satisfied absolutely convinced smiling and persuasive and relentless. Cruise is like that in every movie and hed act like that if he were playing Hamlet too so you have to cast him right. Redford does. As a Republican senator with a plan to extend broaden and perpetuate the war Cruise sounds like he means it and like hes making sense. ""Lions for Lambs"" depicts a complacent country thats prey to scheming and deluded politicians in which the news networks care only about ratings and the public cares only about vapid celebrities. As the veteran journalist Streep plays a dinosaur a 57-year-old woman in television squeezed between her own integrity and the demands of a compromised medium. Shes a marvel to watch. Her listening is absolute and the progress of her thoughts is clear. One of the saddest and most moving 30 seconds onscreen this year consists of Streep riding in a taxi looking at the White House outside her car window ... and then a moment later looking at a line of soldiers gravestones. You know what shes thinking. Shes thinking what Redford is thinking and about what ""Lions for Lambs"" has been saying all along. -- Advisory Battlefield violence gore strong language.

""Rome is burning"" he declares. The words may have been written by screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan but theres no doubt its director Redfords heartfelt belief thats being expressed and we know hes not talking about ancient history.Its hard to think of a precedent for ""Lions for Lambs."" When was the last time three stars of the magnitude of Redford Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise teamed up to make ... a Socratic debate on the perilous state of our nation? Never as far as I know. Intelligent deadly serious made in a spirit of patriotism and protest Redfords movie is more civics lesson than drama and doesnt pretend otherwise. It is what it is a call to action. Nothing if not topical ""Lions for Lambs"" addresses the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq questions the idea that it is Americas duty to spread democracy around the world criticizes journalisms capitulation to political manipulation debates the proper response to terrorism asks the audience to ponder its own responsibility to speak truth to power and reprimands us for allowing Bad Things to happen to a Good Country.Three threads are intertwined in Carnahans unashamedly didactic script. In the most compelling third Cruise and Streep face off in a tense debate. Hes a gung-ho saber-rattling pro-war Republican senator and shes a skeptical TV journalist hes handpicked to reveal a bold new offensive in the Afghanistan battle against the Taliban. A second debate all of which transpires in a college office pits Redfords professor against that bright but disaffected student (Andrew Garfield) whose conscience hes trying to prick if Romes burning we all have to get off our duffs and quench the fire. The third part (the only one that isnt all talk--but the dullest and most perfunctory) shows us two of the professors former students (Derek Luke and Michael Pena) who to their teachers horror have taken up his call to activism by enlisting. They are in fact carrying out the bold and dangerous mission that Cruise is simultaneously selling to Streep--flying by chopper into the mountains of Afghanistan where they are shot down and surrounded by enemy guerilla fighters. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week A movie designed to raise questions rather than provide answers it tries to give Cruises hawkish senator his due but its doubtful many will find him the hero of the piece--how many neocons are going to fork over eight bucks for what is clearly a prosecutorial position paper from one of Hollywoods leading liberal voices? It remains to be seen as well how many critics of Bushs regime want to see a movie that just as easily could have been a play--or even a radio drama. Carnahans script is thoughtful but its ideal venue may be a college debate class not your local multiplex. While its fun watching Streep and Cruise go at each other--he a portrait of slick cocky aggression she parrying his assertions with irony and disbelief--they are not playing characters so much as positions. My hat is off to the passion that propels this movie but I wish more of that urgency were reflected in the filmmaking; Redfords movie in its attempt to be judicious gives off the scent of the classroom. Perhaps the most eloquent and telling thing about ""Lions for Lambs"" is that it exists at all. A movie like this would never have been made unless a whole lot of people--not just a trio of movie stars--felt they were living in a burning Rome.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday November 9 2007 820 PM Lions for Lambs. Political drama about the lives affected by a senators new military strategy. With Meryl Streep Tom Cruise Robert Redford. Director Robert Redford (128). R War violence language. At area theaters.Watching his desperately sincere ""Lions for Lambs"" we can almost feel director Robert Redford reaching through the screen to shake us out of our national complacency. If only hed channeled some of that energy into building a viable movie out of Matthew Michael Carnahans static screenplay.Little more than a well-meant sermon Redfords political drama tries to engage us with three simultaneously occurring story lines. The feeling seems to be that if one doesnt work another will. Unfortunately a single compelling plot would have been far more effective than earnest lectures in triplicate. A perfectly cast Tom Cruise plays Jasper Irving a slick Republican senator willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to win the Presidents War on Terror. In one of the films many dismissals of real-life logic Irving has chosen to unveil his military strategy in an exclusive interview with a very liberal and skeptical journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep). Across the country political science professor Stephen Malley (Redford) is also making a pitch though his target is a bored student named Todd (Andrew Garfield). In an attempt to wake Todd out of his apathetic coma Malley describes the story of two former students who are - at that very moment - sacrificing themselves to the senators strategy. On a desolate hillside in Afghanistan we see Arian (Derek Luke) and Ernest (Michael Pena) as they face the very real consequences of decisions made by privileged white men like Sen. Irving. These two soldiers are underprepared undervalued and unlikely to return home to their loved ones. Streep and Cruise are completely convincing in their roles but like the rest of the cast they arent playing characters so much as representing Points of View. This tactic and the films valid but familiar arguments might have been fleshed out with better results onstage. Blown up on the big screen they have the overall effect of stumbling into the sort of collegiate debate that - Redford might be happy to know - occurs among freshmen every day. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Two students join the Army and are sent to Afghanistan in Lions for Lambs. Photo MGM Lions for Lambs 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Lions for Lambs marks Robert Redfords seventh film as director. Its his first in seven years. I dont know if its lucky and its certainly not his best. But Ill say this for it Its his bravest. Only a fool would make a movie with so much discourse and so little plot. Only the fearless would load it up with adamant speechifying -- critical of the war on terror the American media and the sodden trudge of 21st-century middle-class apathy -- and then yikes invite people to watch. Redford has never disguised his politics but hes never made overtly topical movies either unless you read The Milagro Beanfield War as a diatribe against the hungry maw of agribusiness. His usual M.O. involves either sun-dappled mythologizing or refined tragedy perhaps a bit of both (The Horse Whisperer). But an outright partisan lament? Thats something new. So is the running time short. And the structure tripart. Screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan (who also wrote The Kingdom a topical film with more and louder violence) spins three loosely connected two-person scenarios illustrating alternate perspectives in the war on terror. These character duets unfold in just-about real time triangulating events in Washington D.C. central Asia and an unnamed university in California. In the first story a veteran television reporter (Meryl Streep) interviews a glossy Republican senator (Tom Cruise) announcing a new American military initiative in Afghanistan. In the second two young idealists (Michael Pena and Derek Luke) embark on that very mission. In the third a disconsolate professor (Redford) tries to light a fire under a bright but jaundiced student (Andrew Garfield). It seems those idealists in Part 2 are former students of the professor in Part 3 who regrets their decision to fight but admires their patriotism and will to act. He quotes a German officer from World War I who remarked of the English army ""Never have I seen such lions led by such lambs."" Otherwise the California segment is the worst of the bunch The prof is all bromides the kid is all smarm. The Afghanistan segment is the best nerve-wracking and persuasive; its also the least talky. The D.C. segment plays out as youd expect with Cruise doing his Cruise thang to that practiced gleam in his eye and Streep doing her Streep thang in response -- squirming gorgeously cheekbones popping in bemusement or outrage. Streep is a colossal movie star and a storied talent but shes also a stand-in for the rest of us proles. You can see this earthbound quality near the finish when shes flapping and huffing in a dispute with her boss. She paces. She yanks at her plain blue cardigan. She fiddles with the thermostat. These throwaway Streepian gestures so human so small do what the rest of the films high-minded windbagging cant quite manage They convey the discombobulation of post-9/11 Americans trying to parse the casualties of war against the complexities of fear. To surge or retreat; to push toward the future or examine the past; to write the damn story or quit in protest. ""Do you want to win Janine?"" asks the senator of the journalist. ""Do you want to win the war on terror? Yes or no?"" Lions for Lambs asks plenty of big questions and most of them arent answered. A waffly ending chafes. But thats Redfords point to chafe us cajole us throw us off-balance with a bit of Socratic hectoring that opens up a dialogue on war and the duties of citizenship. Maybe hell get us talking. And maybe thats the bravest thing of all. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Fruit of the Loom Mens Boxer Briefs 8-Pack for 12 + pickup...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post SAN FRANCISCO -- After all the Golden Boy roles Robert Redford moves across a film screen with an aura of confidence and relaxed privilege that he wears like a country- club blazer. But while making his new film ""Lions for Lambs"" the star and director found himself reconnecting to his youth in 1940s Los Angeles a time and place far removed from any ivory towers. ""I grew up in a mostly Mexican neighborhood in South Los Angeles and during the war it was fine"" said Redford who turned 70 last summer. ""My father delivered milk. And everybodys working - it was gas stations garages stores you know but theyre working. There was this real camaraderie with the paper drives and everybody sacrificing. And suddenly the war ended and this weird thing happened. ""Suddenly everything was about class. And then there was an anger you could just feel."" His family moved to the San Fernando Valley looking to escape some of the late-1940s tension but Redford loathed the new neighborhood. He longed to get on any bus or train that would get him away from Southern California. His salvation came in a most natural way a baseball scholarship to the University of Colorado which got him out of town even though he promptly drank his way off the squad. All of this personal history and geography circled back through Redfords mind while he was filming scenes for ""Lions for Lambs"" which opened nationwide Friday. The movie is split among three settings a powerful senators office in Washington a California university campus and a frozen battlefield in the mountains of Afghanistan. For studio issues of budget director Redford reluctantly agreed to use Simi Valley as a stand-in for Afghanistan. He found himself driving through the San Fernando Valley that old home he never missed. ""How about that? Over the hill its the place I left - the place I had to get away from and never wanted to see again - and now I go back there and have to make it look like Afghanistan"" he said with a surprisingly aggressive edge in his voice. ""Here I have to go back and use it for a war."" ""Lions for Lambs"" which stars Meryl Streep Tom Cruise Peter Berg and Redford himself is indeed about combat but it is also about classism citizen apathy and the modern rules of political engagement. The director took the title for his seventh film from the words of a German general who in appraising his British foes saved his scorn for the high command and his praise for the field soldiers whom he considered ""such lions led by such lambs."" The movie will renew Redford as a target of conservatives and its geopolitical topics arent exactly crowd-pleasing fare. None of this seems to matter to Redford but he also said emphatically that ""Lions for Lambs"" is about filmmaking not his preaching for change in politics. ""You cant change peoples minds; I dont try that anymore"" Redford said. ""I spent years working on All the Presidents Men and after it came out I thought Boy no administration will ever be able to get away with this kind of thing. And its worse worse worse."" In person Redford is physically trim and confident in every gesture. The most interesting thing about being across a table from Redford? When he speaks hes a filmmaker but when he smiles hes still pure movie star. In the film Streep plays broadcast journalist Janine Roth a sort of weary version of Diane Sawyer who has found that in recent years the hardest questions she has regard her own industry and its loss of standards and stamina in the face of political manipulation. She spends most of the film in a one-on-one interview in the office of Sen. Jasper Irving (Cruise) who is a neoconservative with a military pedigree and high-wattage smile. The senator is pushing forward a military initiative in Afghanistan and while he jousts with the journalist the film cuts away to its ""lions"" a pair of soldiers (Michael Pena and Derek Luke) who are in harms way in agonizing fashion. The third part of the film presents another office dialogue as a college professor named Stephen Malley (Redford) challenges and attempts to awaken the political passion of a bright student (Andrew Garfield) who has over the course of one semester decided that the only party system worth his time is the one that taps beer kegs. Reviews of the film have been divided - some say winner others say just windy - but Redford said he knows he will be a target for the far right.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 9 2007 Save for later Saved ""Lions for Lambs"" Robert Redfords first directorial feature in seven years is a polemic in search of inspiration. Matthew Michael Carnahans screenplay resembles a middling off-Broadway play. Without the participation of Redford who also acts in the film as well as Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep this talkfest almost certainly would not have seen the light of day.The films structure which is meant to be ambitious comes across instead as schematic. Three separate situations are played out concurrently in something like real time and each is meant to work synergistically with the others.Streep plays Janine Roth a veteran TV journalist in Washington who is summoned to the inner sanctum of Republican Senatorial top gun Jasper Irving played by Cruise in full kilowatt smile mode. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Because of her previous favorable coverage of him Irving presents Roth with an exclusive - a ""new plan"" to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan involving an elite cadre of American soldiers. Roth asks when the secret strategy is to go into effect. His reply ""10 minutes ago."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 In the second situation we follow two of the soldiers on that mission Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke) as things get progressively deadlier. The third story set in ""a California university"" concerns a dressing down in his office between Dr. Stephen Malley (Redford) a political science professor and Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield) a gifted student who is slacking off. Ernesto and Arian were working-class students of Malleys who decided to enlist in the military because they wanted to do more than just talk about solutions.Redford and Carnahan - Carnahan wrote the gung-ho action picture ""The Kingdom"" - are careful to present all points of view in the political spectrum even though its obvious their sympathies do not lie with the Jasper Irvings of this world. But nothing that erupts from these stories is remotely fresh or revelatory. The two soldiers are generic good guys on a fateful mission the student-teacher session is awash in platitudes and the Streep-Cruise sparring session - she resents being used but cant turn down a scoop - is like a David Mamet playlet thats missed its mark.Like many a Hollywood political drama ""Lions for Lambs"" carries a full head of steam that is indistinguishable from a lot of hot air.

Comments Lions for Lambs Rated R  92 minutes No one can fault Matthew Michael Carnahan for his political engagement his screenplays for The Kingdom and this drama both address the moral cost of the war on terror. But the former resulted in a garbled action-adventure flick and the latter directed by Robert Redford yields a passionate but mannered rhetorical exercise. Redford plays a university professor trying to talk some social commitment into a gifted but callow student; meanwhile Meryl Streep is a Judith Miller-type reporter for a cable news network whos being sold a phony scoop by slick Republican senator Tom Cruise (who steals the movie). These two extended colloquies are awkwardly punched up by an action story line in which two of the professors former students now serving in Afghanistan are stranded on a snowy mountaintop with Taliban fighters closing in. The movie is compelling now but unlikely to survive its moment. By J.R.

(David James) Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / November 9 2007 It does not feel good to report that a movie with Robert Redford Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise makes the eyelids droop. But thats what ""Lions for Lambs"" does. The guiding topic is Americas current wartime engagements and like similar movies it operates with a literal mind and wagging finger. When the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan started I was naively eager that Hollywood would find ways to dramatize the conflicts political complexities and personal toll. Were probably too close to get any real artistic perspective. The great movies about Vietnam either were not about the war or were made once it was over.This time around documentary filmmakers have beaten the major movie studios to the punch with hastily made mostly left-leaning rants and mini-exposes that about 35 people have seen. In principle Hollywood had time distance and money on its side to process the many tentacles of this imbroglio into compelling entertainment. Instead for the most part were getting handsome-looking fictional versions of the docu-rants. ""Lions for Lambs"" is the gassiest yet.Directed by Redford and written by Matthew Michael Carnahan the story is divided into three sections that are shuffled into a movie. And as is the current narrative vogue for Important Movies each part will have some higher bearing on the others. In one Cruise plays a hawkish Republican senator who wants to start a new war one rigged for victory and Streep is the seasoned cable-news journalist hes summoned to announce it. In another two young injured American soldiers played by Derek Luke and Michael Pena are trapped behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. And in the third Redford plays a professor at ""a California university.""The professors most promising student Todd has taken a nosedive. So hes invited Todd to possibly the earliest ever office hours for a talking-to. The kick-off to the professors anti-apathy harangue is unpromising ""Let me tell you about the last two kids who gave me hope."" The actor playing him Andrew Garfield is suitably disengaged as good as Streep with the PowerPoint dialogue and a willing punching bag for the movies jabs and low blows. But it might have been cheaper and more aptly symbolic for Redford to have replaced him with a cardboard cutout that said ""Americas Youth."" Of course then another piece of symbolism would be lost Redford appears to be trying to save a young blase version of himself.The politics in Carnahans script - hes the writer of the ""FBI demolishes Saudi Arabia"" action-thriller ""The Kingdom"" - are flung at the screen. Some of them stick. Some of them dont. Hes got more beefs - the wars the politicians who manufacture them the medias pandering complacent college kids not out rioting and protesting - than any bun can hold. There is also bogusness meant to be shaming. Those two stranded soldiers are our sacrificial lambs - ones from Compton the other from East LA (his name is Ernest). And theyre the holiest two in the movie a pair for guilty liberals to think about while they push their carts down the Whole Foods aisle. A good movie lives in here somewhere but after about 20 minutes you realize despite the good lighting syrupy music and Hollywood stars Redford doesnt care whether its good. He just wants it to say something relevant. This is a movie that likes the sound of its own voice.The Cruise-Streep parts of the film actually work because there is push and pull intelligent acting (Cruise does his shark thing well) and a nod to complexity. Redford uses staging that suggests real characters not just positions. Cruise is often literally looking down on Streep who in turn is forced to look up. Redford even chooses to have Cruise photographed from his folded arms up - he looks like a bust awaiting bronze. The debate in the senators office is charged. Ideologically somebody has to lose and the loser wins a well-acted crisis. For a parched audience this seems rather juicy. Its a tiny dramatic oasis.Redford has previously found ways of channeling liberal righteousness into superior Hollywood entertainment. His 1994 television-corruption essay ""Quiz Show"" still rumbles defiantly. ""Lions for Lambs"" though is less a movie than a series of lectures - the senator lectures the newswoman; the professor lectures the student; those two kids who gave Redford hope lecture their classmates; over at Bagram Air Base Peter Berg the director of ""The Kingdom"" plays a lieutenant colonel lecturing his troops. For good measure Redford and his editor toss in close-ups of people especially Streep scribbling down notes. Several of the movies hes made have their chalkboard moments. This is the first to come with a set of fingernails.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

Built as three separate story modules - the student-professor conference a reporter-U.S. senator interview in Washington and a stealth combat mission in Afghanistan - this talky A-list job slowly connects the dots serving its message in speeches not dialogue.Redford directing from a screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan (of the far livelier if ludicrous Middle East adventure The Kingdom) wastes the talents of the great cinematographer Philippe Rousselot. Theres not much even a master shooter can do when youve essentially got two actors locked in a room. Thats where Redford and Garfield find themselves ringed by books about Vietnam and other history lessons gone unlearned.And three time-zones to the east Tom Cruise (as Sen. Jasper Irving) and Meryl Streep (as veteran TV journo Janine Roth) are trapped together in an oak-paneled office furnished with an American flag a fancy rug and framed photos of big shots. Irving an ambitious young GOP pol a Harvard-schooled West Point-trained conservative has invited the reporter to his chambers for an ""exclusive"" Hes telling her and her alone about a ""new strategy"" to win the war against evildoers. Apparently it is 2009 and the U.S. is still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan. (No mention of whos residing in the White House alas.)The third strand of Lions for Lambs interwoven screenplay Army Rangers Arian Finch (Derek Luke) and Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) fallen from a helicopter and trapped on the snowbound ridges of a mountain range in northern Afghanistan. Theyre lying there broken and bloodied as the Taliban closes in.With awkward cutaway shots to ticking clocks to Streeps pen as she scratches shorthand in her reporters notebook and with the connective backstory of soldiers Arian and Ernest coming to light Lions for Lambs lumbers to its end.Hobbled by a kerplunky script the magnificent Streep and the charismatic Cruise are left to offer tics nods and knowing grins; the discourse is flat and so is their lengthy ""real time"" tAate-A -tAate. Redford fares no better while the young Garfield at least comes off as convincingly arrogant. Luke and Pena halfway around the world are believable as good buddies trapped in a bad place.For the record and the curious the title Lions for Lambs is explained somewhere in the dull plod of all this A German general in World War I remarking on the courage and composure of the British troops being slaughtered by the thousands at the behest of their commanding officers noted ""Nowhere else have I seen such lions led by such lambs.""Lions for Lambs  (out of four stars) Directed by Robert Redford.

In a production being marketed with the tag line ""If you dont stand for something you might fall for anything"" Tom Cruise and Robert Redford play stick figures -- one a Republican senator the other an idealistic professor -- who speechify against apathy and rattle on about the need for action. (The journalist played by Meryl Streep is action-averse; shes a liberal.) Yet action is in short supply and the film as a whole manages to stand for nothing at all. ENLARGE Thats no small achievement since so many of its issues -- domestic politics the Middle East the clash of civilizations -- are debated with such steadfast self-importance. Eventually though theyre all reduced to a snoozeful thrum by a process that works like noise-canceling headphones -- every speech stance or position has its nullifying opposite. You could make a case for this as a feature-film version of the FCCs fairness doctrine but it feels more like a blandness doctrine a pulling and hauling of the tone-deaf script which is credited to Matthew Michael Carnahan to the point of perfect vacuousness. The films opening scene is a colloquy between Jasper Irving the United States senator that Mr. Cruise plays with bizarre but entertaining elan and Ms. Streeps Janine Roth a reporter he has summoned to his office in order to feed her a Big Story (which proves to be small and murky) about an imminent new direction in the war against terrorism. Its hard to know what kind of reporter Janine is since she seems to be writing newspaper-style think pieces for a TV network. But theres no doubt about Sen. Irvings role. Hes a Strangelovian self-parodying right-winger who speaks with ominous intensity about ""taking the high ground"" fingers Iran as the present enemy and dismisses Janines dovishness with elaborate scorn ""Unfortunately civilizations do not sustain themselves through nonviolent responses."" Up to this point ""Lions for Lambs"" stands clearly enough as a left-wing assault on military adventurism and the war in Iraq. That must have been its original intention but then the movie tries in its bobble-headed talking-headed way to be all things to all persuasions. The reporter turns into a sappy parody of timorous liberalism. Stephen Malley the professor played by Mr. Redford -- who also directed with a leaden touch -- peddles only banalities in urging a bright disaffected student to step up to the task of changing the system. Then theres the ambiguous plight of two of Malleys former students. They stepped up by joining up; now theyre soldiers facing death from enemy fire in the deep snow of Afghanistan. Are they victims of Sen. Irvings hawkishness or of liberal reluctance to prosecute an all-out war? No way to know. ""Lions for Lambs"" is a shallow tar pit cluttered with skeletal ideas. No Country for Old Men The villain in ""No Country for Old Men"" a psychopath named Chigurh who is played to demonic perfection by Javier Bardem uses a coin toss to decide a potential victims fate. Im not advocating the same approach to seeing Joel and Ethan Coens spectacular new thriller only noting both sides of its coin -- uncommon cinematic artistry along with some of the most horrifically violent moments ever put on screen. If watching movie violence is cathartic then this film amounts to heavy therapy. Its much more than that however. This is the best film the Coen brothers have done since their glory days of ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" maybe the best theyve done period. My admiration is tempered only by my apparently incurable resistance to the very qualities that draw others to the Coens work -- the stylization I find self-preening the philosophizing that seems sententious. ENLARGE Javier Bardem shows his sinister side in No Country for Old Men. Yet the film was adapted from a highly stylized crime novel with philosophy at its core Cormac McCarthys lean -- and cinematic -- disquisition on good and evil and on the question of whether the nature of evil has recently been changing. (The lethal nail gun wielded by Chigurh the most terrifying screen monster since Dennis Hoppers Frank Booth in ""Blue Velvet"" suggests at the very least that evils arsenal has been upgraded.) The plot is set into motion -- into what quickly becomes the headlong motion of a fateful trackdown -- when Llewelyn Moss a scruffy Texas hunter played by Josh Brolin stumbles on a small fortune not to mention a shipment of heroin that Chigurh is determined to recover at all costs. Mr. Brolin gives a fine performance strong but self-effacing while Tommy Lee Jones plays the disillusioned and gallantly superannuated Sheriff Bell. Its tempting to wonder if Cormac McCarthy wrote the book with the actor in mind because whats on screen is a fine but familiar Tommy Lee Jones performance -- world-weariness suffused by regret at human frailty -- plugged into the perfect receptacle. The cinematographer was Roger Deakins; his work is a marvel as it has been in so many Coen brothers films including ""Fargo"" ""Barton Fink"" and most recently ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" Though Sheriff Bell is the storys soulful philosopher Mr. Deakins captures the movies soul in stark sere landscapes and haunted faces. And of course in the spectacle at once spectral and corporeal of Javier Bardems unspeakable reaper. Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead Its tempting to say that Sidney Lumet at the age of 83 has forgotten more than most young directors will ever know. But its wrong. ""Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead"" which goes into national release today shows that Mr. Lumet has forgotten nothing and still knows more than almost anyone about the elusive art of directing actors. His new film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke as Andy and Hank impecunious (and singularly sleazy) brothers who decide to rob their parents suburban jewelry story. Its a dopey scheme to which the two men bring complementary stupidities and the movie begins with the beguiling silliness of an Italian farce of the late 1950s. When the heist goes wrong however the farce turns into a deadly serious study of cowardice and greed and then into a tale of biblical rage between Albert Finneys pitiless father and Mr. Hoffmans monstrous son. (Thats not to slight Mr. Hawkes performance; Hank is simply less flamboyant than his older brother who from the outset is at the end of a very short frayed rope.) The original script by Kelly Masterson hops back and forth in time laying out the evolution and execution of the crime then re-examining specific events from different points of view. The structure is tricky but consistently interesting mainly because Mr. Lumets actors are so effective. Marisa Tomei is Andys childlike wife Rosemary Harris is the brothers mother. Ron Fortunato did the high-contrast digital cinematography which is appropriate as well as dramatic. This is not a drama of shadings but of ever-increasing intensity.    DVD TIP Tom Cruise was lest we forget charming and winning in his first starring role as Joel Goodsen the rich kid in the 1983 sex comedy ""Risky Business."" Rebecca De Mornay is Lana the prostitute who helps turn Joels home into a brothel while his parents are on vacation. Paul Brickman directed from his original script.

"The Winds of War Strangely Calm washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Winds of War Strangely Calm Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | Lions for Lambs TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 9 2007 Crisply turned out in an impeccably starched white shirt Tom Cruise resembles the human version of one of former defense secretary Donald Rumsfelds ""snowflakes"" in ""Lions for Lambs"" an impassioned but strangely inert current-events drama directed by Robert Redford. Cruise plays a fictional Republican U.S. senator named Jasper Irving a bright charismatic young gun whose good looks spit-shine image and West Point credentials Cruise projects with characteristic force and focus. As ""Lions for Lambs"" opens Irving welcomes reporter Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) into his office for an hour-long interview. As Roth opens her notebook Irving reveals his true agenda to give her a scoop about a new military initiative in Afghanistan one involving small light forces serving in risky forward positions on the countrys most forbidding terrain. When is the policy going to take effect Roth asks? ""Ten minutes ago"" Irving responds. While Irving and Roth spar about strategy history 9/11 and Vietnam ""Lions for Lambs"" introduces scenes unfolding elsewhere at exactly the same time In Afghanistan two Special Forces soldiers deploy to a snowy mountaintop as part of the shakedown cruise of the new policy. Meanwhile at an unnamed university in California political science professor Stephen Malley (Redford) has called his most promising student Todd Hayes (British actor Andrew Garfield) to his office for a come-to-Jesus speech about his academic performance. Intercutting among the three contemporaneous scenes ""Lions for Lambs"" sets up an arresting conceit wherein politics theory and practice are played out in real time. While Roth who senses shes being played warily banters with Irving about the virtues and contradictions of U.S. foreign policy (where he sees American righteousness she sees quagmires and cannon fodder) Malley tries desperately to startle Hayes out of his frat-boy haze of apathy and entitlement. ""Rome is burning son"" Malley says at one point going on to suggest that every American is either putting out the fire or fiddling. Whereas the encounters in Washington and California have their moments of stirring rhetorical power (its a particular pleasure to watch Streep and Cruise have at one another) ultimately they amount to shots of two people talking across a desk. Redford who has proven a fluent director with such efforts as ""Ordinary People"" and ""Quiz Show"" is stymied by a talky script by Matthew Michael Carnahan that would be more at home on a small theater stage. The only action to speak of occurs in Afghanistan where Arian Finch (Derek Luke) and Ernest Rodriguez (Michael PeA?a) do their talking in a transport helicopter and across a moonlit snowfield. (It bears noting that Carnahan also wrote ""The Kingdom"" directed by Peter Berg who shows up in a cameo as the mens commanding officer.) If ""Lions for Lambs"" is all talk it still bristles with conviction with Redfords speeches obviously conveying the filmmakers own credo which combines disgust about the state of current political affairs with deep-seated patriotism and idealism. When Streeps character faces a fateful journalistic choice in Washington (lets call it the Judith Miller Conundrum) its impossible not to see the ghost of Redfords Bob Woodward in ""All the Presidents Men"" and understand how far Redford believes journalism has fallen from its sacred skeptical perch. For all its passion and topical currency ""Lions for Lambs"" plays too often like a college colloquium with one extended scene of a classroom debate suffering from all the sleep-inducing effects of the real thing. And it ends on a curiously unsatisfying note with each characters choice whether fateful or fatal hanging in a confounding limbo of indeterminacy. Ambiguity is always a more sophisticated choice than neat ribbons and bows and theres certainly room in the cinematic universe for movies that raise more questions than they answer. But even those who are sympathetic with Redfords sentiments and call to action may find themselves frustrated by a movie that wants to have it both ways setting up an intriguing high-stakes framework but finally refusing to hang anything on it. ""Lions for Lambs"" might have worked as a digital-video experiment or an op-ed column but as a movie it chooses to lie down just when it should roar. Lions for Lambs (88 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for some war violence and profanity.

Meanwhile up in Washington Tom Cruise is baring his whiter-than-white incisors as a smooth-talking high-flying young senator who has granted veteran television-news reporter Meryl Streep an hour-long audience to announce a new more aggressive military policy in Afghanistan. The filmmakers must have imagined sparky engaging conversation between these duos similar to a high-speed tennis bout between skillful pros; what emerges is more comparable to a lazy afternoon table-tennis knockabout in an old peoples home. While these pairs talk and talk and then talk some more either directly or indirectly touching on some current and always broad American political divisions we witness some action in the dark mountains of Afghanistan and the tragedy of two soldiers played by Derek Luke and Michael Pena. We later discover that these two young men are former students of Redford who considering how best to engage in political discourse have boldly decided to enlist. And so with these two men on the mountainside the films plot is complete Redford and Carnahan know all too well that important Hollywood movies these days must have circular stories that tie together different apparently unrelated strands in a flash of slightly corrupted chronology. That way lies universality greatness and sometimes even awards.Back to the two soldiers - Im not sure whether were meant to think that these young men are regretting their choice to join the army or that were meant to see them as ordinary heroes as they find themselves surrounded by shadowy armed figures on a deserted mountain-side. They emerge as both - not an entirely different perspective to writer Matthew Michael Carnahans recent The Kingdom in which he also argued that Our Boys - or Their Boys - are suffering the effects of poor decisions by central government. Its a crafty - some might say cowardly - way of ensuring both dissent and patriotism in the same film. Theres another scene here in which Cruise gives a monologue the message of which amounts to Dont ever forget 9/11. Hes a smarmy politician and were not meant to trust him yet the music blares up for this speech. Its have-your-cake-eat-it time.The politics of this film are basic beyond belief which would be acceptable is they werent also so muddled and unconvincingly expressed. Apathy is a theme the promising student is obviously a symbol of latent intelligence which if roused might make for a more varied and powerful political debate among the American people. Yet this tack is heavily compromised by the casting of the director in the role of the selfless humanitarian with a message; personally I dont like being lectured by Hollywood millionaires especially when their script bears little evidence of real engagement with ideas. The conversation between Redford and Garfield - about grabbing life by the balls about avoiding regrets about whether to engage or just to coast along through life - is not very interesting or credible. Its very stagey and its point is made early on. Some lines are designed for Oscar-night clips Rome is burning son says Redford and the problem is with us.Over in Washington the pairing of Cruise and Streep has a little more dynamism to it. Cruise is fairly charismatic as a teflon politician who tries to charm and flatter Streep into delivering the good news of a new offensive action in Afghanistan batting away any suggestions that there might be a draft coming and declining to dwell on past errors. But Streep looks like she doesnt buy a word of her characters apparent transformation from willing servant of a television network to someone who two hours later throws her editor the most hackneyed line - You were good once - while refusing to spin in the usual fashion the government story fed to her by Cruise. Are we meant to believe that this woman who writes features for Time magazine and is a leading American journalist with decades of experience is only jolted into chronic self-doubt and able finally to see that television networks may push a populist agenda after an unexceptional hour-long conversation with a senator about a quite unremarkable foreign policy development? I know Tom Cruise is meant to be charming but come on... The look on Streeps face says it all unconvinced. When she steps out of an anonymous government building in Washington were supposed to recall All The Presidents Men. That film puts this nonsense to shame.

The army were at my sons Primary school teaching the children to march and they had not even consulted the parents beforehand. I think the job of the army is to defend us against attack but not to interfere in the poltics of other countries. You do not see the Australians or the Swedish getting involved the way America and Britain do. There are lots of evil regimes in the world and the way to deal with them is to shame them in the way that apartheid was shamed. But blasting people with rockets is really not a civilised way to behave and makes us no better than them. This was a very unusual film and perhaps the reason people do not like it us because they expect special effects and explosions and car chases. I agree that it was more like a play than a movie but the script is excellent as are all the performances. I am glad this movie was made and I hope it provokes people to think about the ""war on terror"" and whether that is what it really is or is it just a question of America and Britian protecting their economic interests abroad.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 16 2008mojo123Featuredthis is the worst film everits not a trillerdocumentryaction filmlove storywar filmits americans blown there own trumpet about how educatedand more advanced to the rest of us.newsflash...their notFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 21 2007Alison HudsonFeaturedProbably the worst movie Ive ever seen.

Trouble is the people who have by now realised that they were duped will find nothing new here. And those who still do not realise they were duped do not go to see this type of film. I admire Redford and I hear he put a lot of his own money into this film. This must be another proof of the mans decency and altruism Unfortunately altruism alone does not make good films and this one is stagey lacking in drama and somewhat tedious in parts. Meryle and Tom put on a good show but being boxed into a room all the time their potential is wasted. Full marks to Robert but low marks for his film. It just doesnt work.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 18 2007mastermindFeaturedA very earnest film with excellent intentions. To wit the Iraq war is an endless quagmire and unless we (the American public) wake up to that theres no end in sight. Also we (the American press and the the American public) were duped once before so we should not believe in new strategies announced by politicians during the run up to electionor we will end up getting duped again. And so on. Thing is those who already know they were duped wont find anything new here. And those who do not know they were duped do not go to see a film like this. I admire Redford and Im told he put a lot of his own money into this and this must be another good mark towads his reputation for altruism. Unfortunately altruism alone doesnt make good films and this one is static and sometimes quite boring and ultimately leaves one thinking that it is just another hand-wringing exercise by the Americans on the theme of how could we such a kind and loving people have gotten ourselves into such a nasty mess. The Deerhunter Platoon and other films had a similar theme but made far better use of it. So full marks to Robert (and Meryle and Tom certainly do their best) but not a good film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 14 2007zaneFeaturedThis film is worth seeing for Meryl Streeps performance which was incredible.

If you want a film thats interesting engaging gripping or anything else thats positive go and see something else. If you want a film you can fidget in get bored in consider leaving - repeatedly - and come out saying That was really rubbish then this is the film for you. Quite a Republican film lots of references to the axis of evil and they attacked us first - Afghanistan apparently; if George Bush didnt write this film he certainly approved the script wholeheartedly. Nothing much happens zero on the tension front seen more gripping breakfast cereals. Good performances from Meryl Streep Tom Cruise and Robert Redford either they were fed Rohypnol when they agreed to do the film or theyre closet Republicans or half the film was cut out. Though finally after an hour and a halfs waiting and without warning a really good thing did happen it ended.

The sugar is suspense mystery romance -- the sweeteners Hollywood sprinkles over Important Issues like corporate duplicity or blood diamonds to render them palatable. Lions for Lambs is different. Its all medicine and doesnt try to hide the fact. It doesnt pretend to be a thriller or a love story or a vehicle for George Clooneys five-oclock-shadow heroism. Directed by Robert Redford and written by the gifted topical button pusher Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom) the movie consists mostly of people sitting around rooms usually two at a time debating the conflict in Afghanistan the quagmire of Iraq the arrogance (or is it stay-the-course courage?) of war-on-terror politicians the superficiality (or is it muzzling?) of the press and the complacency of everyone else. Are we having fun yet? Lions for Lambs may be the first movie that feels as if it should have a credit that reads ""Based on an episode of The Charlie Rose Show."" The tiny scale and armchair talkiness mark the movie as a bit of a folly an act of idealistic hubris in todays commercial marketplace yet thats its (minor) fascination too. It hops among three segments. In Washington D.C. Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) a smooth young right-wing senator is being interviewed by Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) a TV reporter. Irving has summoned the journalist who once wrote a TIME cover story heralding his rise to power to announce a U.S. military surge in the war in Afghanistan. But the interview turns into a debate as the reporter picks apart the administrations euphemisms and the senator parrots the Bush-Cheney line -- with more eloquence it must be said than Bush musters. Cruise in his cocksure-logician mode doesnt condescend; he gives the neocon rhetoric its due. But its Streep braiding hesitancy and aggression who wins the acting contest and the reporter who trumps the senators arguments -- even if he then trumps her back nailing the press hypocrisy its urge to duck any blame for first supporting the Iraq invasion. Meanwhile in California Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield) a cynical college student conferences with his poli-sci professor (Redford) who wants to know why the once-avid scholar has been skipping his class. Redford plays it like a master shrink coaxing the kids vulnerabilities out from behind a wised-up veneer. Their debate might be called ""Why Try to Change a World Thats Too Corrupt to Change?"" All of which leads to the third segment in which two soldiers (Michael Pena and Derek Luke) -- both former students of Redfords prof -- board a chopper in Afghanistan as part of the surge Cruises senator was selling. Lions for Lambs is so square its like something out of the gray twilight glow of the golden age of television. Even the military plot which clunks seems to be taking place on stage. Yet Carnahans writing ignites familiar issues with vigor and snap; theres audacity in its attempt to seize us with nothing but a war of rhetoric. Maybe Lions for Lambs wouldnt seem like such a folly in a movie culture that risked making more follies like it.

By Anthony Lane Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones in a new movie from the Coen brothers.   Credit PHILIP BURKE The new Coen brothers movie ""No Country for Old Men"" is set in Texas with a foray over the border into Mexico. The cinematography is by Roger Deakins a trusted collaborator of the Coens who holds the wide camel-brown sweep of the Texas scrubland steady in the frame as if he were filming the Serengeti. When a hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) perches on a crag and trains his binoculars or the telescopic sight of his rifle on a herd on the plains below we expect to see lions not antelope. His shot misses and the antelope leap away but the next group in Mosss vision lies still a litter of abandoned vehicles and scattered among them human bodies. How Moss reacts to the carnage--or to be exact how intensely he underreacts--determines the rest of the film. Where you or I would throw up and call the cops he bides his time checks the surroundings then wanders down to the scene. A drug deal has gone viciously wrong; one man is still breathing and he whispers for water but Moss walks away with something better in mind. He finds it--a black case packed with two million dollars. Not bad for a days hunting. What follows is an extended chase with a number of interested parties joining the fray. There is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) whose eyes have seen everything in this corner of the world and who wants the law to reach Moss before something less merciful finds him. Later there is Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) a hired hand who prides himself on tracking down the most elusive prey. More stubborn than either of them is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). If you think the name is hard to place try the rest of him. He is smiling courteous but essentially shorn of humor; his movements though as careful and unhurried as a surgeons are bent not on the relief of pain but on its violent imposition; and his idea of fun is to weigh a mans life--should he perish should he survive--on the toss of a coin. It is difficult to define what Chigurh wants from his own life. All we can say for sure is that he wants those two million bucks. The film is adapted from Cormac McCarthys novel of the same name which in turn took its title from Yeats ""That is no country for old men. The young / In one anothers arms birds in the trees."" No such vivacity--what Yeats calls the ""sensual music"" of the lusting world--haunts either the book or the film. True there is a querulous speech by one of Bells fellow-sheriffs from another county railing against todays kids ""with green hair bones through their noses"" but the Texas that looms up through the movie is no country for young men either. There is barely any music sensual or otherwise and Carter Burwells score is little more than a fitful murmur. The story takes place in 1980 but cut out the cars and the drugs and we could be in 1880--look at Bell and his deputy saddling up to scour the crime scene. (""You cant help but compare yourself against the old timers"" Bell confides to us in voice-over.) Indeed the characters rapport with the soil is more reliable in its grounded primitivism than their relations with one another and the Coens certainly honor the novelists abiding preference for the mythical over the modern. The most urgent pursuit comes not on a highway but down a rushing river with a man being sought by a remorseless dog as if by a hound from Hell. So what do we end up with? Well as a thriller ""No Country for Old Men"" is tight pointed and immune to the temptations of speed. I found myself in the same predicament with the film as with the book--approaching both in a state of rare excitement yet willing myself all too soon to be more engaged than I actually was. If I want wry lawmen and smart calculating fugitives Ill get them from Elmore Leonard; and if I want Leonard Ill take him neat rather than slow-filtered drop by drop through a layer of Faulkner then laced with the Book of Jeremiah. That is how the novel sounded to me at any rate and McCarthys bent for the apocalyptic--most naked in ""The Road"" (2006) a greater work by far--suffers a curious transformation in the hands of the Coens. It shrinks into a fatalistic fetishism screws turned by knives a cold bottle of milk still sweating from the fridge dust tracks at the bottom of a ventilation shaft and countless slowly spreading pools of blood. Needless to say you could call every one of those details as a witness to the Coens powers of suspense and ""No Country for Old Men"" is beyond question a return to the dark simmering days of their best work in ""Blood Simple"" and ""Millers Crossing."" The travesty of recent years (how much would you pay not to watch ""Intolerable Cruelty"" or ""The Ladykillers"" again?) is all but wiped out by the new film although as with those two fumbles at comedy there remains a nagging sense that the Coens are not so much investing their emotions in a cinematic genre--in this case the Western revenge drama--as picking it up inspecting it and then setting themselves the task of constructing a perfect copy. Acts of monstrosity are coolly perpetrated throughout but the resulting film strays beyond cool to the verge of the passionless; if Deakinss camera leans in close to gaze on damaged flesh (we focus on Chigurhs leg as he swabs and stitches a gunshot wound) that is not because the Coens harbor any tenderness or pity still less an urge to lament the legacy of violence. They simply retain a juvenile weakness for gore challenging us to match their sang-froid and saluting Chigurh himself for showing the way. There is no denying that Javier Bardem cuts a singular figure. For one thing he currently has the biggest noblest and most sculpted head of anyone in movies (previous titleholders include John Huston) and I can never quite suppress the thought watching him onscreen that he must have flown straight to the set from Easter Island. So why burden him for this film with a helmetlike hair style that makes him look like the fifth Monkee? The answer is that Chigurh is less a person than a conceit an angel of death stalking the landscape like a plague. As with his weapon of choice--a stun gun powered by compressed gas of the type normally used in the slaughter of cattle--the hair is a design quirk filling in for a character trait. The movie charts no moral shift in Chigurh or indeed in the men around him; all of them are set in stone from the beginning (Sheriff Bell appears to be made from stone) and we gradually realize that ""No Country for Old Men"" is not telling a tale--the plot remains open-ended--but reinforcing the legend of a place like a poem adding to an oral tradition. Texas is presented as a state of being where good and evil circle doggedly around each other and it just doesnt occur to Moss that he could take his black bag catch a flight and seek a world elsewhere. I was awed by the control of the movie which seems as pressurized as Chigurhs murder machine but after an hour and a quarter I felt that it had made its point and done all the damage it could. In the event it crawls past the two-hour mark and you sense that the Coens like their unkillable villain are prepared to go on forever. We were promised a spate of intelligent probing films about Americas wars abroad and about the implications for life back home but results so far have been ragged. To be fair directors face a heavy task. How can you explore the policy debate over Afghanistan say without having your movie sound like a policy debate? To judge by ""Lions for Lambs"" the answer is You cant. Robert Redfords film written by Matthew Michael Carnahan is braided from three strands like a rope. First an eager young senator in Washington (Tom Cruise) reveals a new military initiative to a skeptical reporter (Meryl Streep). Second we watch that initiative in practice as a pair of front-line troops (Derek Luke and Michael Pena) are left wounded on an Afghan mountain in the snow with the Taliban closing in. Third we listen to a professor (Robert Redford) who taught the two soldiers at college where they were close friends while he tells a fun-loving student (Andrew Garfield) to get off his backside and engage with the world. The three stories are intercut through-out the film to lend it at least the illusion of momentum. Sadly unless you are Jean-Luc Godard the sight of your characters discussing the political ethics of their own actions is unlikely to ravish the eye and ""Lions for Lambs"" is most charitably described as Ibsen with helicopters. It winces with liberal self-chastisement Redford is surely smart enough to realize as the professor turns his ire on those who merely chatter while Rome burns that his movie is itself no better or more morally effective than high-concept Hollywood fiddling. He may even spare a smile for the harshest irony of all the one scorching performance here cheerfully laying waste to the niggles of the peacemakers is that of Tom Cruise who does for Republican warmongering what he did for the rampant libido in ""Magnolia."" In person he is reportedly a Democrat but the G.O.P. should poach him anyway; why settle for crusty old Fred Thompson when you could have young Top Gun himself?

The last time I was stuck in a political science class listening to a beardy guy of about 32 tell me that racists could never be free because they were imprisoned by their prejudices - News I can use - hearing liberal fantasies was costing me (OK the ROTC program that was paying my scholarship) about 800 a minute. So an 11 ticket to ""Lions for Lambs"" is a relative bargain. On the other hand if you want to be bored by pompous-assery ""Meet the Press"" is free. Directed by Robert Redford the movie intercuts among three pairs A liberal journalist (Meryl Streep) interviews a hawkish Republican senator (Tom Cruise) in D.C.; a hip California professor (Redford) urges a student to take action in the world; and two soldiers ex-students of the prof are stranded on a snowy mountaintop in Afghanistan because of the senators idiotic policy shift. The soldiers dont get much to do - theyre injured and cant move so theyre waiting to be either shot by the ""Tallies"" in the hills or rescued. Their story takes up but a few minutes. The lions share of the screen time goes to the boring baaing in California and D.C. The Streep-Cruise discussion scales new heights on Mount Banal; apparently Hollywood is so dumb it thinks it can be called incisive simply by having two people hit the talking points weve all seen on every TV news roundtable for the last four years. Streep makes liberal arguments so routine that Streep herself could have written her lines (Iraq never attacked us we armed Saddam in the first place the people who planned the war had no combat experience). Sen. Cruise who was first in his class at West Point is meant to be seductive with his spiel (its a war for civilization weve made mistakes in the past but weve got a better plan this time we cant let our enemies claim victory Irans ambitions must be thwarted) but the two of them essentially talk past each other. (Hint to the senator When she implies youre a soft touch because you werent in the infantry when you served in the military now is the time to mention that Lincoln Wilson and FDR werent combat vets either or that three-war veteran Doug MacArthur would have made a lousy president.) The only thing maintaining the viewers interest is a sort of meta-suspense Which side will the screenwriter inform us has won? (Hint The senator has pictures of himself posing with Crueleezza Rice and BeelzeBush.) Meanwhile the movie gives as much time to the prof and the student in California as it does to the D.C. scene as if we cared what these two airbags had to say. The Redford character who senses that his young charge is brilliant but lazy tries to save him with what the movie thinks is a fresh new idea Hey son - work for the government Redford approves of the ex-students who enlisted and wound up in A-stan because they had cooked up some fuzzy Clintonian scheme to save the world by dragooning all high school juniors into serving their country for a year in uniform or not. If Redfords supposedly precocious student actually were the free thinker hes meant to be he might reply that far from being ""ignored"" by the country the poorest parts of America are the ones with the largest government footprint The housing and hospitals tend to be state-owned many residents have government jobs and others subsist on government handouts. Clinton did do a lot for poor Americans - by limiting welfare not by his dippy ""AmeriCorps"" Eurail pass/resume polisher for the overprivileged. ""Lions for Lambs"" is proud of its fast talk and its big words but these merely put the script at the level of any barroom conversation between informed adults. It thinks it has a radically different take because it tells us to love the patriotic and duty-bound soldiers (the lions) but hate the empty suits in D.C. (the lambs). That idea actually makes the film less brave not more. What could be less controversial than to say I support the troops but despise the ninnies on Capitol Hill? Running time 88 minutes. Rated R (profanity war violence). At the Lincoln Square the Orpheum the Kips Bay others.

Talky back-bendingly liberal but also deeply patriotic ""Lions for Lambs"" plays like all the serious footnotes scripter du jour Matthew Michael Carnahan left out of ""The Kingdom."" Robert Redfords first helming chore in seven years and his most directly political pic yet amounts to a giant cry of ""Americans get engaged"" wrapped in a star-heavy discourse that uses a lot of words to say nothing new. Apart from the curio value of Redford Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise headlining the movie equivalent of an Off Broadway play this first outing by newly resurgent UA doesnt look likely to roar its way to significant B.O. gains. Schematic idea sounds bold on paper three separate events played out roughly in real screen time across three separate timezones with each potentially cross-fertilizing the others. Problem is as the cross-cutting proceeds it becomes increasingly evident that each yarn exists in its own very specific frame of reference with no real human drama to buttress the moral-political conflict. In Washington D.C. veteran TV journo Janine Roth (Streep) arrives for a one-on-one interview with Republican young gun Sen. Jasper Irving (Cruise) who has an exclusive to feed her for his own purposes. Meanwhile earlier that same morning at ""a California university"" Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield) a student whos been skipping class gets dressed down by his professor Dr. Stephen Malley (Redford). Concurrently a small force of U.S. soldiers is airlifted to a strategic mountainous location in the Afghan mountains to head off the Taliban. In the early stages the three strands are cleverly linked. Irving tells Roth the administration has a ""new plan"" to resolve the deadlock in Afghanistan sending small groups to secure advance positions ahead of the spring thaw. When Roth asks when this will be implemented Irving replies ""Ten minutes ago."" Two of the grunts in the first group Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke) are former students of Malleys. To try to break through Hayes lackadaisical attitude toward his studies and life in general Malley tells Hayes the story of Rodriguez and Finch both of whom enlisted in the military as a way to engage in their countrys foreign problems rather than just sit back and take the high ground. In addressing the issue of the U.S. role as both world policeman and a credible force for good Carnahans screenplay thus takes three clearly defined avenues of approach the practical (Rodriguez-Finch) the political (Irving-Roth) and the philosophical (Malley-Hayes). All three avenues however lead nowhere in particular. The first moves from the gung-ho through military bungling to personal useless sacrifice; the second through point-by-point confrontation to ultimate resignation; and the third ends vaguely with only a glimmer of hope. Most engrossing moments are generated by the political tennis match between the young senator and the cynical reporter. Both thesps are perfectly cast and at the top of their game with Cruise believably incarnating a Young Turk who believes Americas credibility (as ""a force of righteousness"") is now at stake while Streeps veteran journo is more interested in digging up past mistakes and Middle Eastern history. The to-and-fro of their political debate gives both actors a fine workout and plays to the strengths of their screen personas. But as Carnahans script dutifully checks off the issues it becomes clear the discourse is leading nowhere and is merely a rerun of arguments already extensively aired by media around the world. Roth has no new arguments to propose and Irvings only solution is more positive action. Meanwhile back in California the talk is turning even fuzzier. Faced with Hayes continuing skepticism-cum-lack of interest in his countrys politics Malley finally rounds on him with ""Rome is burning."" ""So youre saying its better to try and fail than do nothing?"" asks Hayes. ""At least you (can say you) did something"" replies Malley. Well yeah. With almost no character backgrounding beyond repping various schools of thought the actors largely get by on screen charisma. Cruise and Streep generate the most sparks; Redford brings a relaxed slightly supercilious elder-statesman aura to the role of the mature academic; and young Brit actor Garfield is convincing as an unengaged SoCal student though his character remains enigmatic to the end. Production values are fine. Philippe Rousselots widescreen lensing and Jan Roelfs production design manage distinctive looks for the three strands from the burnished formal interiors of Irvings office and the sunnier relaxed campus quarters to the grit and snow of an Afghan mountaintop. Mark Ishams score is low-key until the muddled finale of the military strand when it slips into unseemly (and inexplicable) patriotic bombast. As if to underline the symbiotic link between Carnahans two scripts ""The Kingdom"" helmer Peter Berg pops up here in a supporting role.

Dave Calhoun joins Tom Cruise and Robert Redford at the world premiere of Lions for Lambs at the London Film Festival Redford and Cruise at LFF Lions for Lambs gala Lions for Lambs - or more accurately Politics for Dummies - is directed by Robert Redford and stars Redford as a corduroy-clad idealistic university tutor in California who spends most of this self-important and empty film - thats at least six years too late to have any real relevance beyond the box-office - in conversation with a promising but lazy student (Alex Garfield) who he wants to teach the value of personal and political engagement. Meanwhile up in Washington Tom Cruise is baring his whiter-than-white incisors as a smooth-talking high-flying young senator who has granted veteran television-news reporter Meryl Streep an hour-long audience to announce a new more aggressive military policy in Afghanistan. The filmmakers must have imagined sparky engaging conversation between these duos similar to a high-speed tennis bout between skillful pros; what emerges is more comparable to a lazy afternoon table-tennis knockabout in an old peoples home. While these pairs talk and talk and then talk some more either directly or indirectly touching on some current and always broad American political divisions we witness some action in the dark mountains of Afghanistan and the tragedy of two soldiers played by Derek Luke and Michael Pena. We later discover that these two young men are former students of Redford who considering how best to engage in political discourse have boldly decided to enlist. And so with these two men on the mountainside the films plot is complete Redford and Carnahan know all too well that important Hollywood movies these days must have circular stories that tie together different apparently unrelated strands in a flash of slightly corrupted chronology. That way lies universality greatness and sometimes even awards. Back to the two soldiers - Im not sure whether were meant to think that these young men are regretting their choice to join the army or that were meant to see them as ordinary heroes as they find themselves surrounded by shadowy armed figures on a deserted mountain-side. They emerge as both - not an entirely different perspective to writer Matthew Michael Carnahans recent The Kingdom in which he also argued that Our Boys - or Their Boys - are suffering the effects of poor decisions by central government. Its a crafty - some might say cowardly - way of ensuring both dissent and patriotism in the same film. Theres another scene here in which Cruise gives a monologue the message of which amounts to Dont ever forget 9/11. Hes a smarmy politician and were not meant to trust him yet the music blares up for this speech. Its have-your-cake-eat-it time. The politics of this film are basic beyond belief which would be acceptable is they werent also so muddled and unconvincingly expressed. Apathy is a theme the promising student is obviously a symbol of latent intelligence which if roused might make for a more varied and powerful political debate among the American people. Yet this tack is heavily compromised by the casting of the director in the role of the selfless humanitarian with a message; personally I dont like being lectured by Hollywood millionaires especially when their script bears little evidence of real engagement with ideas. The conversation between Redford and Garfield - about grabbing life by the balls about avoiding regrets about whether to engage or just to coast along through life - is not very interesting or credible. Its very stagey and its point is made early on. Some lines are designed for Oscar-night clips Rome is burning son says Redford and the problem is with us.Over in Washington the pairing of Cruise and Streep has a little more dynamism to it. Cruise is fairly charismatic as a teflon politician who tries to charm and flatter Streep into delivering the good news of a new offensive action in Afghanistan batting away any suggestions that there might be a draft coming and declining to dwell on past errors. But Streep looks like she doesnt buy a word of her characters apparent transformation from willing servant of a television network to someone who two hours later throws her editor the most hackneyed line - You were good once - while refusing to spin in the usual fashion the government story fed to her by Cruise. Are we meant to believe that this woman who writes features for Time magazine and is a leading American journalist with decades of experience is only jolted into chronic self-doubt and able finally to see that television networks may push a populist agenda after an unexceptional hour-long conversation with a senator about a quite unremarkable foreign policy development? I know Tom Cruise is meant to be charming but come on... The look on Streeps face says it all unconvinced. When she steps out of an anonymous government building in Washington were supposed to recall All The Presidents Men. That film puts this nonsense to shame.
