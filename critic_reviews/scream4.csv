"Scream 4 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; scream-4 ) Scream 4 (United States 2011) April 16 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Eleven years after Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her posse last tangled with a mad slasher/killer the Scream series has been exhumed. Ignoring or forgetting that the final part of the original trilogy Scream 3 underwhelmed in terms of popular reaction and ticket sales the filmmakers have exhaled a last rattling breath of desperation and returned to a well that ran dry last millennium and hasnt gained any moisture since then. Theres no real story here; Scream 4 offers little more than a group of familiar characters wandering around a horror movie setting and uttering self-referential one-liners as the body count mounts... and mounts... and mounts. Screams brand of horror which lampooned the slasher genre while simultaneously embracing it was fun and breezy in 1996. In 2011 its about as fresh as the whiff of something stale and rank from a crypt. Time in the Scream world has moved on in lock-step with time in the real world so when we revisit the lazy town of Woodsboro everyone who survived Scream 3 is older (although not necessarily wiser). The Stab series of films created by former reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) remain popular having reached installment 7. Meanwhile Woodsboro prepares for the unofficial ""celebration"" of the anniversary of the original massacre - something that irritates Sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) to no end since he alone thinks mass murder shouldnt be feted. Sidney now in her early 30s has returned for this event to promote the publication of a book about self-healing and to make peace with her past. The Ghost Face Killer has chosen this year to emerge from hibernation and his targets appear to be Sidney and those few remaining family members her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and her aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell). Of course Jills teenage friends like Kirby (Hayden Panettiere) and Charlie (Rory Culkin) might as well get fitted for body bags rather than prom outfits. Scream 4 is so obsessed with the self-referential element that made the original Scream unique that it loses the capacity to be genuinely scary or funny. As in the recursive opening sequence (which features cameos by the likes of Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell) it tries too hard. The first two Screams worked because they were effortless. Scream 4 like its predecessor shows the screenwriters seams. The story is thin and belabored - more an excuse to encounter old friends and revel in new gore than the ""revision"" promised by the promotional material. The tag line is ""New Decade. New Rules."" But it doesnt seem like much has changed except that the word ""reboot"" gets mentioned a few times. Despite regurgitating elements from its predecessors Scream 4 is not a reboot; its a sequel. Toward the end theres an opportunity for Scream 4 to break from the monotony of Horror 101 and at least for a moment I thought it was going to do it. Just as the glee was beginning to well up within me at the audacity being displayed by everyone involved (the actors director Wes Craven scriptwriter Kevin Williamson) the bubble burst. Its a cruel tease more frustrating that the pieces of fruit in Austin Powers. The near-brush with boldness makes the flaccid conclusion all the more disappointing. The returning actors deserve commendation for sliding effortlessly into personalities they have not donned for more than a decade - not that the characters were all that rich or substantial to begin with. The newcomers - Emma Roberts Hayden Panettiere Rory Culkin - have been chosen because of their connection with a younger audience. (Roberts was in kindergarten when the original Scream was released.) While its understandable why the veteran actors might be interesting in revisiting Scream (nice paychecks) the reasons for Cravens involvement are less clear. This is a comedown for one of horrors Iron Chefs. The most the director can cook from this screenplay are a few weak ""boo"" moments and one instance of jump-in-your-seat startlement (which is a throw-away near-miss auto accident). Theres a casserole of blood and viscera but its all routine. Maybe the ""torture porn"" era of horror has left audiences jaded about that element. I doubt this is the last well see of the Scream series since horror franchises are as incapable of being killed as their monstrous stars. It is less likely that Craven will be back for a Scream 5. To quote Danny Glover hes getting too old for this shit. Scream 4 will probably prove sufficiently profitable that the Weinsteins will dial up another one and this series will transform into what it once gleefully parodied - if its not there already.

Scream 4 reviewed The self-aware horror franchise gets back on track. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 15 2011 608 PM Cutting Edge Scream 4 puts the self-aware horror franchise back on track. By Josh Levin Scream 4 It didnt take long for the Scream franchise to become fully self-aware. At the midway point of 1996s series opener Jamie Kennedys film geek runs through the rules to survive a horror movie Dont have sex dont do drugs dont say ""Ill be right back."" Though Screams skewering of horror convention changed the way scary movies are made and consumed it didnt leave much room for intra-franchise progress. Scream 2 squeezes the last few liters of blood out of the old movie-within-a-movie conceit. The execrable Scream 3 which features both the ""real"" characters and ""movie"" doppelgangers from the cast of Stab 2 might as well have been filmed on a red-corn-syrup-slathered Mobius strip. Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. What does a movie franchise do when it starts to resemble a Borges story thats been translated into English by Babel Fish and directed by Uwe Boll? Take a break for 11 years then try again. Though critics and the movies ever-discerning characters refer to Scream 4 (Dimension) as a reboot its more like a reversion--an abandonment of the New Scream formula in favor of Scream Classic. Kevin Williamson who wrote Scream and Scream 2 before skipping out on the third has returned for the fourth installment and the action has moved back to Woodsboro the site of the original massacre. As all scary movies should Scream 4 puts craft ahead of cleverness--it knows when self-consciousness is a handy tool and when its a lazy crutch. At this point I will give the requisite spoiler warning Though I wouldnt dare give away the movies big finish I cant really talk about Scream 4 without revealing the opening sequence. OK now that the spoiler police are gone its time for me to undermine everything Ive written so far Scream 4 begins with a movie within a movie within a movie. In the opening sequence two teenage girls get slaughtered by a Facebook stalker. This turns out to be the beginning of Stab 6--hey its a sequel within a sequel--and a character played by Anna Paquin grouses that weve just seen ""the death of horror right here in front of us."" Really a Facebook stalker? Her friend (Kristen Bell) then stabs her in the stomach. This is the beginning of Stab 7 which is being watched by yet another set of teen girls (including Friday Night Lights Aimee Teegarden). Once they get killed Scream 4 finally begins. Advertisement Along with revealing the producers commitment to filling the screen with as many young attractive women as possible--actress reboot--this three-part bloodbath is I believe an extended apology for the series misguided forays into post-postmodernism. ""Stab 5 has time travel"" says Teegardens Jenny Randall explaining that its ""by far the worst."" While I suppose this could be interpreted as Lost mockery or perhaps a shot at the legendary Amityville Its About Time Im sticking with my were-sorry-Scream 3-sucked theory. Indeed once Scream 4 casts aside sketch comedy in favor of an actual narrative it manages to skewer sequeldoms pitfalls without succumbing to them. This time around Neve Campbells battered and bruised Sidney Prescott has returned to her hometown to promote a memoir about ""leaving her victimhood behind."" Sidney moves in with her aunt and cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) whose high school crew--the requisite bad boy (Nico Tortorella) pair of movie nerds (Erik Knudsen and Rory Culkin) and popular-girl duo (Marielle Jaffe and Hayden Panettiere)--is soon menaced by the masked slasher Ghostface. Scream 4 is not My Dinner With Andre--the dialogue often drifts from snappy to functional (has anyone ever said the word cyberspace out loud?) and the actors sometimes sound as if theyre still in rehearsal. The interactions between Courteney Coxs newswoman Gale Weathers and David Arquettes flatfoot Dewey are particularly stilted and unnaturalistic--its comic relief thats a relief only when it stops. (One might venture that the actors marital troubles played a part in their performances but they also stank in the other Scream movies.) The movies kiddie corps though is energetic and competent and the fabulous Alison Brie adrenalizes the script in her bit part as Sidneys gleefully foulmouthed book publicist. ""Two girls butchered"" she shrieks delighted by the PR possibilities. ""Fuck me wow"" Youthful brio expletives and callbacks to 1996--the slasher-movie scholars proffer a list of rules for reboots including the promise of a ""third-act main-cast blood bath""--wouldnt be enough to carry Scream 4 if it werent for Wes Craven. The 71-year-old director knows how to make a scary movie--how pacing lighting music and gaping chest wounds blend together to build dread and anticipation. Craven guides us expertly down a series of blind bloody alleys a journey thats more pleasurable than frustrating. On account of his steady hand the last act is as good as could be expected skillfully conceived and entertaining in its preposterousness. Its amazing that Williamson and Craven pulled it off and the studio shouldnt push its luck with another sequel. Of course a strong opening weekend means Scream 5 wont be far off. And oh yes there will be time travel. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Why are these sequel makers such serial killjoys? This question arises while pondering the good the bad and the dispiriting of ""Scream 4."" Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson reunite for a story that pays plenty of homage to their 1996 original but doesnt come close to besting it. The duo appear to argue that this is their point -- which if true would make this a strangely cynical undertaking. Still compared with so many of the rebooted slasher flicks ""Scream 4"" remains a cut above. No that is not an intended pun. Well leave that to the black-cloaked killer with the rubber mask that combines a spooky apparition with Edvard Munchs character from his famous series of artworks ""The Scream."" ""Scream 4"" opens with its customary stabbing then adds a twist of the knife. Its the anniversary of the killings that put Woodsboro on the map and made survivor Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) the inspiration for a fictional ""Stab"" franchise based on the reporting of Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Having penned a self-help book Sidney now returns to Woodsboro on a book tour that coincides with her darkest moment. And before you can say ""Stab 7"" the body count climbs. Once again Sidney is the focus of a killer who likes to begin his cruelty with a phone call or -- this being a brave new world -- maybe a text. And this time Sidneys cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and Aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell) are also in danger. This time the Westboro High kids cant focus on the real murders of their friends because theyre obsessed with the way they play off the ""Stab"" franchise. Will death get in the way of the cinema clubs annual ""Stab""-athon? Its all very self-referential. Just how hyper-winking and ""meta"" is ""Scream 4""? Well a character even uses the word ""meta.""

But that was a scene from a movie Stab 6 that two other girls are watching when their phone rings a gravelly voice threatens them and -- surprise -- one girl kills the other. And that turns out to be the climax of Stab 7 which two girls in Woodsboro Ohio are watching when a ""real"" monster in the same Munch-y mask intrudes and slices them up. Cue the title of our movie Scream 4. There may be a point in a horror-film series at which self-referential becomes self-reverential but Scream passed that long ago. Back in 1996 when director Wes Craven filmed Kevin Williamsons all-knowing mostly joking script the innovation was that for once the people on-screen were as aware of horror-movie cliches and twists as the people in the audience. With its masked murderer (nicknamed Ghostface) following such angels of serial death as Halloweens Michael Myers and Friday the 13ths Jason as well as Cravens own dream weaver Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street the Scream series twisted the genre rules in a pop-modernist way that complimented the movies fans for their hipness even as it eviscerated their on-screen doppelgangers. After three episodes the series dribbled out in 2000 -- the same year as the first of four Final Destination scare-athons and long before any of the seven Saw films the four Resident Evils or the Hollywood tart-ups of Japans Ju-On (The Grudge) and The Ring cycles. After 11 years and the proliferation of these and many other movie-wise horror series whats left to say or show? Call it Scream the Next Generation. The young folks of the first film -- chief damsel in distress Sidney (Neve Campbell) police officer Dewey (David Arquette) and cub reporter Gail (Courteney Cox) whose book The Woodsboro Murders has been spun into the Stab movie franchise -- have reconvened just as a rash of copycat murders makes everyone jumpy and/or dead. Again someone is stalking the people nearest to Sidney her aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell) her young cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and a half-dozen of Jills friends. Many of them die luridly; one of them is the new Ghostface. With sassy appearances by the latest class of TV-show femmes -- Lucy Hale (Pretty Little Liars) Shenae Grimes (the 90210 reboot) Anna Paquin (True Blood) Kristen Bell (Heroes) Aimee Teegarden (Friday Night Lights) Brittany Robertson (Life Unexpected) and perkiest of the bunch Heroes Hayden Panettiere as the movies snarkiest most desirable vamp -- the movie seems nouveau in attitude but its retro in its abiding by basic horror tropes. Chief among them the gore-nographic precept that the slashers victims (Scream 4s first eight deaths plus a few others later) must be attractive young women because killing guys just isnt sexy. The movie views the murders with an amused Olympian detachment as if the gutted women were figures in a torture-porn update of the Clue board game thats lavish in locations but limited in weaponry the scantily dressed teen in the bedroom with a knife; the snooty publicist in a deserted parking garage with a knife; one of Sidneys relatives inside her front door with a knife through the mail slot. Creating clever people who do stupid things -- like wandering alone upstairs or out into the night or down into a dank cellar always into the killers serrated embrace -- the new Scream achieves a certain purity of form a low level of perfection. It accepts and in fact revels in the tradition of separating the slaughter scenes with long arid dialogue patches that function as concession-stand breaks. Though the movie makes use of texting and Twitter its essentially an old-fashioned whodunit in which people still get scared over the phone and killed in person. Back in the 1940s Sorry Wrong Number sanded audiences nerves down to the nub with its story of a frail woman terrorized by a voice on the phone. Scream 4 uses new media to manage the same old thrills. Some critics have praised or damned the movie on behavioral grounds. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle writes that Scream 4 ""makes us care about the characters""; Roger Ebert chastises it as ""a film that doesnt care about human insights."" But morality and caring about characters are as irrelevant here as they would be in Last Year at Marienbad or any other sophisticated film construct -- and certainly beside the point in an entertainment that keeps telling you its only a movie about movies. Existing in a self-contained universe Scre4m is its own remake (Screamake) sequel (shriekquel) parody and critique. Thus it taunts and pleases audiences mocks and justifies itself and makes any review redundant. So well devote just one paragraph to noting that on its own terms Scream 4 is pretty good. The opening film-within-a-film-within-a-film gag is as sharp as the best parodies on the Funny or Die website (like Billy Crystals recent When Harry Met Sally sequel with Helen Mirren). Williamsons bitchy wit extends to inside jokes about his stars most cuttingly the improbable marriage of Cox and Arquette who met while filming the first Scream; one character says ""It always seemed more like a movie romance than a real one."" Cinematographer Peter Demings use of shadows and space wont evoke comparisons to camera master Gregg Toland but they create a suitably creepy aura. So does the production design; on the front door of Sidneys house look for the warp in the wood which mimics Ghostfaces silhouette. Similarly Scream 4 bears the imprints the ghost faces of so many other horror movies that it is a one-film fright festival. Both knowing and naive it is best seen at a midnight screening with an audience prepared to laugh and shudder -- or at home alone in the dark with the doors bolted and the phones shut off.

There thats out of the way. Now we can discuss the pertinent issues that matter such as the housing market and ones personal safety standards. Lets do this. The first thing that throws me about the entire Scream franchise is the houses. They are always perfectly clean modeled and lovely. Theres never anything amiss no laundry anywhere the floors are all wood the appliances all stainless steel. I suppose the thought that ""Hey these people are being murdered in Suburbia"" should terrify me all the more than someone dying in a dingy back alley but I can never emotionally get there. I just see these terrifically saccharine and tidy houses and figure they are going to have a tough time moving those units post-slaying especially in this housing market. I cant imagine murder depreciation is anything to scoff at. Heres the other thing. By this point Sidney Prescott should be Americas most finely honed human weapon. Can you imagine having survived the dozens of attacks she has? Wouldnt you treat yourself to a little Jujitsu training the occasional light Krav Maga tutorial and be basically strapped to the gills with automatic weapons? Had I been through a quarter of what Ms. Prescott has endured Id make Rambo look like a charity case. And who would blame me? Person 1 Who is that person? And why is she carrying an arsenal with her? Person 2 Oh thats just Sidney Prescott. Shes a bit concerned for her safety. Person 3 Thats Sid Prescott?? The poor dear I wonder if shed want my bokken to carry with her too? Yes in this hypothetical the pairing is practicing Kendo. Still the point is a valid one and although in this iteration of Scream Ms. Prescott seems to have largely mastered the art of not being too afraid like a fighter pilot who has faced constant danger she doesnt seem to have taken her studies to the next level in the way Id expect. So that was bothersome though not unexpected. Now then as for the film itself Scre4m or Scream 4 or Scre-four-em it starts out with what might just be the most most meta beginning ever because it starts with the Stab franchise. Yep thats the fictional franchise within the Scream universe which is of course modeled after Sidney Prescotts fictional life within the film. Regardless of the ""in"" ardor the entire opening works appealing to both our short attention spans and a predilection to like the series. Also working? The clever dialogue brisk pacing and frenetic music. The killer still generally calls on a landline but they throw in references to Facebook and Twitter weaving in occasional cell phone stalking for good measure. No they dont bother to deal with the prominence of caller ID as then youd have no movie. And yes youll definitely have that moment where you question the logic of well everything before realizing that it hardly matters. The premise and updating of Sidney Prescott as a character is also well formulated. Shes back in town to sell a book while advocating an ""Im not going to be a victim anymore"" message. David Arquette is still bumbling as a town sheriff and Courteney Cox reprises her scheming and plotting take on Gale Weathers. The murder count is high the blood flows continually and the film does well to keep your guesses and suppositions off-balance. A perfectly acceptable Friday night Scream 4 delivers plenty of scares without consequences murder without depth and a flood of legacy laughs. Though loftier philosophical messages are broached and then largely ignored (the idea that We Live in Public) its hard to fault Scream 4 for not taking things too seriously. This isnt a film that matters in any real sense but its also not poorly done and as such deserves a smallish amount of praise.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 15 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English At this late stage in the deconstruction game Scream 4 pretty much reviews itself. Nevertheless in the interest of any lingering curiosity not to mention my paycheque lets give it a slight assist. And slightness of course is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the occasion. First a brief history. Back in the nineties with the original Scream frightmeister Wes Craven stopped making horror flicks in order to make horror flicks about horror flicks. Actually that gives him more credit than he deserves. The genre was already self-referential - we all knew the familiar tropes. Craven and his scribe Kevin Williamson just made it explicitly self-referential writing that familiarity into the script so that on screen and off characters and audience alike could congratulate themselves on their pop-culture smarts. It made for a smug yet democratic brand of irony. When everything is a broad wink and a big nudge no one is out of the joke. Multimedia Scream 4 the official trailer Admittedly irony isnt scary but at this point in their evolution neither were most horror films. The genre was built on the assumption that its fun to be frightened. The Scream franchise simply had fun with the fact that the frights were largely gone disappeared down the sinkhole of movie cliche and convention and all that remained was the pretense of fear. So the franchise invited us to laugh at the rust in the mechanisms of suspense while still pretending to be afraid. In that sense we were acting too - the whole notion of self-conscious performance extended even to the audience. Since then in the hopes of reacquiring its scary mojo horror has either mimicked the politics of modern war getting all torture-porn on us or borrowed from our camera-obsessed technology hoping to blur the boundary between documented fact and wigged-out fiction. In both cases the goal is to eliminate the pretense cut close to realitys bone and dig deep into the marrow of fear. Consequently the Scream conceit where the goal is just the opposite - inflate the pretense and then peel away its phony layers - seems awfully dated these days. Thats probably why Scream 4 looks suspiciously like Grandpa stuffed into hipster jeans just a fuddy-duddy trying way too hard to be cool and clever. Yes Neve Campbell Courteney Cox and David Arquette are among the returning fuddies reprising their respective roles as victim-in-chief journo-to-the-rescue and incompetent cop. Before they show up things start out with a jeopardized pair of nubile teens watching a movie about a jeopardized pair of nubile teens watching ... well you get the idea. If not someone is there to remark on the tedium of all this ""self-aware postmodern meta"" stuff thereby opening the door for more of the tedious same - more nubile teens in states of undress (headed by Emma Roberts) more movie-wise kids talking up the movies more cameras within cameras more ghosts in the Ghostface machine. Obviously by now this is as predictable as the predictability it once lampooned. So the fun has gone along with the frights disappeared down an identical sinkhole. Not even the smug irony endures - its hard to congratulate yourself for being in on a stale joke. The cliched simile tells us that an incestuous culture is like a snake swallowing its own tail. With Scream 4 the time has come to amend that cliche - here its more like a plumbers snake swallowing something rather different.

"Scream 4 review Wes Craven back in fine form |       NJ.com comments Scream 4 review Wes Craven back in fine form Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 15 2011 at 717 AM View/Post Comments Neve Campbell comes back for another round against the masked killer in ""Scream 4."" Do you like scary movies?"" That was the question the masked killer of ""Scream"" would sometimes ask his targets before he stalked and sliced them. And for the movies fans the answer was yes we do -- if theyre as good as this one. Giddily guiltlessly self-referential -- the 1996 film made fun of genre conventions even as it confirmed them -- it functioned both as a knowing homage and a new classic. Unfortunately the biggest cliche about horror movies is that they have to have a sequel. But after two dutiful follow-ups -- the last one 11 years ago -- there didnt seem to be much life left in the franchise. Well now the original artists have taken a new stab at it. Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson are back (along with an uncredited and probably unnecessary Ehren Kruger who wrote the third film). Returning too are the few survivors -- perpetual victim Neve Campbell hard-edged reporter Courteney Cox and forever-too-late lawman David Arquette. Oh yeah also on hand is yet another new killer in a creepy ghost mask. And a new set of sexy high-schoolers ready to be cut and stacked like cordwood. Not all of these are welcome returns. All knife-edge tendons and brittle badly acted anger Cox looks like she wandered in from ""Desperate Housewives""; the awful Arquette looks more like a strangled gopher than ever. (And having this real-life estranged couple playing an on-screen quarrelling one gives the film a bit of verisimilitude it doesnt need.) Campbell however -- who always spiced her virginal vulnerable victim with dashes of eye-rolling impatience -- is a welcome sight. Her Sidney has survived three bouts with three different killers to become -- what else -- the best-selling author of an inspirational memoir. But then her book tour brings her home. And suddenly a fourth ""Ghost Face"" starts Cuisinarting the kiddies. Craven (who also created the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series and the nasty ""Last House on the Left"") and Williamson (who went on to write TVs ""Dawsons Creek"" and ""The Vampire Diaries"") are in fine form here particularly with a hall-of-mirrors opening. And the affectionate horror-fan in-jokes are outnumbered only by the suspects. In that crucial way this fourth go-round is the one that is most like the original film -- although in a few small ways its a bit diminished too. Despite an early dis of torture-porn movies for example one of the murder scenes features spilled intestines -- a nasty detail the first ""Scream"" might have glanced over. And although Hayden Panettiere is lively as the obligatory ""bad"" girl shes so thoroughly shellacked and spray-tanned she looks like a plastic bag of clementines. But the movie still has a masked villain with a knife chasing screaming kids -- and most important still knows thats a situation both full of horror and ripe for parody. (Honestly was any satire ever more redundant than the ""Scary Movie"" franchise?) ""Scream"" always made fun of itself even as it was frightening us -- and that hasnt changed a bit. Ratings note The film contains gory violence strong language and alcohol abuse. Scream 4 (R) Dimension (111 min.) Directed by Wes Craven. With Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette. Now playing in New Jersey.

(Gemma La Mana/Dimension Films) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday April 15 2011 400 AM Title Scream 4 With Neve Campbell Emma Roberts. Ghostface stalks his old victim and her family. Director Wes Craven (141). R strong language gruesome violence. At area theaters.All those tired of the ""torture porn"" trend will find emphatic support from Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson who created the genre-redefining ""Scream"" in 1996 and turn ""Scream Four"" into their own personal lament for good old-fashioned slashing.They do not approve of the current state of horror with its brainless gimmicks and ugly cynicism. And they are determined to beat it to a bloody pulp dragging its lifeless corpse down Main Street.Certainly anyone sick of seeing Costas Mandylor sub for Tobin Bell in the umpteenth ""Saw"" sequel will appreciate their efforts.But after a promising start that uses Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell to perfection they settle into their old stomping grounds as if theyd never left -- and that turns out to be a letdown.Theres a frustratingly lazy feel to the plot in which Neve Campbells Sidney returns home to Woodsboro with a new book and some haunted memories. Shes staying with her niece (Emma Roberts) a rebellious teenager with lots of pretty hard-partying friends (including Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin). Surely you can guess what that means.Indeed before long Sidneys old nemesis Ghostface has resurrected himself to stalk her and anyone nearby. This leaves Sheriff Riley (David Arquette) perpetually confounded while pushy writer Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) -- now Mrs. Riley -- tries to solve the crime.Eleven years after ""Scream 3"" the series is as meta as ever which makes for many amusing moments. But why are these savvy kids still leaving their doors unlocked? Why hasnt Sidney been fitted for a permanent holster?Relying on obvious cliches doesnt seem ironic anymore just easy. And though there are several genuine jolts poor pacing leaves too much time between the silliness and scares.Craven and Williamson have done little to renew their model so for all its clever self-awareness this once-sharp franchise now feels noticeably dated. Despite the witty banter the storys as disposable as a blonde in a tight sweater or her boyfriend with the Channing Tatum abs.

Starring Neve Campbell Courteney Cox Emma Roberts Hayden Panettiere David Arquette Adam Brody Anthony Anderson Alison Brie Director Wes Craven Running time 143 Release Opened Apr 15 2011  Editorial Review A slasher paint-by-numbersBy Michael OSullivanFriday April 15 2011""Scream 4"" has issues.If it were a person and not a movie it would be a 17-year-old bulimic girl desperate for the attention of 17-year-old boys and alternately bingeing on cheesy slasher-flick cliches and purging by pointing out over and over just how gag-me-with-a spoon cheesy they are. On the one hand it is obsessed with itself winking and pouting in front of the metaphorical mirror of self-referential scrutiny that the series -- directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson -- is famous for. On the other it suffers from a case of crushingly low self-esteem reminding us at every turn just how lame it is. (In a sense it wont shut up about how fat it looks in these jeans.) The put-downs of course are meant to get a laugh. The problem is the movie doesnt really care if we are laughing with it or at it.Set 10 years after ""Scream 3"" the movie centers on the return of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) to her hometown of Woodsboro notable for being the site of a series of grisly murders by a psychopath dubbed Ghostface in a black robe and Halloween mask. (Unlike say the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" movies a new killer is revealed under the mask in each installment.) Film after film although its always Sidney who is the source of Ghostfaces homicidal rage most of the victims are collateral damage lusty teenagers lazy cops and others who happen to get in the way. Along with Campbell Courteney Cox and David Arquette return as nosy newswoman-turned-writer Gayle Weathers and bumbling sheriff Dewey Riley who are now married to each other.Just as with the earlier ""Scream"" films this one apes the conventions of the teen frightfest while sneering at them. Scenes alternate between attacks on adolescents by the butchers knife-wielding Ghostface and conversations between the victims surviving classmates about just how predictable and formulaic his modus operandi is. Fresh blood is provided -- in some cases quite literally -- by Hayden Panettiere Emma Roberts Marielle Jaffe Rory Culkin Nico Tortorella and Erik Knudsen as horror-obsessed high-schoolers.At the heart of the film is a joke Whats happening on screen is just like a bad horror movie. Except that by acknowledging its own badness ""Scream 4"" hopes to turn itself into a good horror movie. Or at least a hip funny and self-aware one.But does that trick even work anymore? How long can Craven and Williamson milk the same shtick -- mocking B movies and being one -- before the audience catches on that theyre running around in circles? As with all genre films -- romantic comedies westerns gangster movies etc. -- theres a certain pleasure that comes from going through the same familiar motions. But when does a comfortable groove become a rut? Admittedly theres a bit of fun to be had here. Craven and Williamson update the story for todays tech-savvy zeitgeist by adding live video blogging iPhone apps and miscellaneous social media to the murderous mix. Ghostface doesnt just taunt his victims by phone anymore; he texts them. Its ""The Social Network"" but with blood Yet other than waiting for the inevitable ""Scooby-Doo""-like revelation of this episodes killer there just isnt a whole lot thats new. As Gayle says to Dewey during a police press conference ""Any comment on the fact that the murders seem to resemble the pattern of the original Woodsboro murders?""Dewey doesnt have a good answer. But one of ""Scream 4s"" teenage film geeks just might when he wonders aloud whether the bloodbath thats happening all around him is less a legitimate ""shriek-quel"" than an uninspired ""screa-make."" Contains obscenity violence gore and underage drinking.

The horror film is like sex no? Its all about how it ends. ""Scre4m"" provides strong evidence that the meta thing has gone about as far as it can go With their dying gasps arterially vented victims make cute pop-culture references. The ""Scream 4"" (I refuse to write it the other way anymore) drinking game Take a slug every time someone on-screen remarks how meta it all is. And its leading to an ending thats ridiculous and longwinded. Endings of horror films should be a single perfect image -- Tony Perkins trying to look like he wouldnt hurt a fly or the empty patch of lawn where Michael Myers should be. Comedies should end with a big laugh. ""Scream 4"" ends . . . busily. MORE BEST amp; WORST OF THE SCREAM TRILOGY We begin on the anniversary of the original killings in Woodsboro a town that treats the murder spree like a cute pop trend. Effigies of the Munch-masked hemo goblin ""Ghostface"" are hung on lampposts. Sidney Prescott (Neve Cambell) has written her own book about surviving while journalist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) who is now her husband (so meta) look into a new spate of killings many of them involving taunts from a familiar voice on the phone. Kids at the high school (Emma Roberts Hayden Panettiere Rory Culkin) incessantly talk about horror-movie conventions and plan to attend a party showing a series of ""Stab"" movies based on the original murders and serving also as spoofs of the franchise were watching. Really How many times can you make variations on the same joke? The meta stuff is flattering you trying to make you think youre smart for noticing what is obvious. When the killer asks one character some slasher-flick trivia then backs down when she gives every possible correct answer does that make any sense or is it just meant to make you feel at home? There are a few clever reversals and the plot at least keeps you guessing. (Someone I momentarily thought was the culprit instead gets multitudinously punctured minutes later.) But were essentially watching two films that dont mix all that well -- the rhythm is smirk smirk shriek. In one of these two parallel movies everyone sits around talking about ""genre."" (Another drinking game lies herein.) Some of the joshing is fun -- theres a smartphone program that disguises your voice to make you sound like growly Ghostface. (Its a killer app.) Occasionally there are satiric thrusts that are about as effective as being stabbed with a ballpoint pen Nobody reads anymore everyone wants to be famous people spend too much time on the Web. Parts of the script seem like junior Aaron Sorkin blasts at that awful Internet which people so unfairly use to say mean things about Aaron Sorkin and this films creative team director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson. The other interspersed movie is a routine slasheroo that really doesnt upend the cliches we keep hearing about. Why do people get out of their cars wander into darkened yards seem almost willfully disinclined to glance in more than one direction? Because the script isnt as clever as it wants to be. Chasing the surprise ending means abandoning other important elements -- a good motive is absent and there is a hugely jarring coincidence. ""This is just silly"" someone says. Admitting it doesnt make it less true. (On the other hand having someone tell Campbell ""Your ingenue days are over"" is just mean. Neve bless her remains touching in her ineptitude. She is still convinced that the way to play extreme stress is to squint slightly and here I give you yet another drinking game.) Also one quick question for this burg after it suffers more perforations than a sheet of stamps Why doesnt anybody just buy a gun? I guess the female characters spent all their money on tight tank tops.

Credit Gemma La Mana/Weinstein Company Like its predecessors ""Scream 4"" replaces the values of storytelling and suspense with the value of being in on the joke. Unfortunately in the 11 years since ""Scream 3"" the joke has gotten pretty old.The writer Kevin Williamson the director Wes Craven and the stars Neve Campbell Courteney Cox and David Arquette the core ""Scream"" team has reassembled and the action has returned to Woodsboro scene of the original 1996 film. Sidney (Ms. Campbell) comes home to promote her book on surviving improbable personal tragedy spurring the return of Ghostface -- surely the least interesting killer in a successful horror-movie franchise -- and setting the scene for another melange of movie references and flatly staged chases and killings.There are flashes of wit in the opening film-within-a-film-within-a-film sequence which uses bankable blondes like Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell as Ghostface fodder. And some later jokes like a visual jab at the director Robert Rodriguez are funny. Others like naming a minor character Anthony Perkins are just dumb.But the central conceit of the characters fates being determined by the ""rules"" of horror movies feels irredeemably tired; a clever idea that was worth one movie. When a character comments on how meta everything is the audience laughs but why? Only because its been conditioned to just as its been conditioned to think that the intellectual window dressing makes the ""Scream"" movies something more than slasher films. Or scary movies for a generation of filmgoers who dont like being scared.""Scream 4"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Stabbing impaling crushing and disemboweling but as several self-deprecating on-screen jokes point out no nudity.SCREAM 4Opens on Friday nationwide.

"Fourth film is so unoriginal you could Scream - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Fourth film is so unoriginal you could Scream By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Scream 4 may not be the scariest film this year but its certainly the most self-referential. By Gemma La Mana Dimension Films What is that? Alison Brie left Marley Shelton Adam Brody Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette and Anthony Anderson are back in Woodsboro. EnlargeClose By Gemma La Mana Dimension Films What is that? Alison Brie left Marley Shelton Adam Brody Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette and Anthony Anderson are back in Woodsboro. The modern homage it pays to its predecessors turns out to be the best thing about the film. Unfortunately that accounts for only the first 20 minutes. The movie-within-a-movie concept is twistier than usual including a surprisingly comical cameo with Kristen Bell and Anna Paquin. Writer Kevin Williamson skewers the horror genre with snarky wit. But its hard to sustain that cheeky meta humor and the film seems to just give in and join its slasher brethren devolving into a string of gruesome but unoriginal slayings. The story is pinned to Sidney (Neve Campbell) the lone survivor of a series of grisly murders. She returns after many years to Woodsboro the small town where Ghostface (inspired of course by Edvard Munchs famous The Scream painting) went on killing sprees. She shows up on the anniversary of the killings to plug her new book. Denizens of the town include inept cop Dewey (David Arquette) whos married to has-been journalist Gale (Courteney Cox) which adds another level of art imitating life. His none-too-sharp law enforcer is meant to be funny but the laughs never come. But theyre just the first generation of Scream-ers. This incarnation is focused on Sidneys niece Jill (Emma Roberts) and her pals high school babes played by Hayden Panettiere and Marielle Jaffe who are lusted after by fellow classmates and movie geeks played by Rory Culkin and Erik Knudsen. Of that group Panettiere gives the liveliest performance. Campbell whose character is meant to have found some peace in her life after all the turmoil comes off bland and one-note. About the movie Scream 4  out of fourStars Neve Campbell Emma Roberts Courteney Cox David Arquette Rory CulkinDirector Wes CravenDistributor Weinstein Co./Dimension FilmsRating R for strong bloody violence language and some teen drinkingRunning time 1 hour 43 minutesOpens Friday nationwide The reboot directed by horror veteran Wes Craven has an auspicious start that doesnt pan out. Maybe as the movie jokingly implies weve all grown jaded. After all it has been 11 years since Scream 3 and many horror movies have hit screens in the intervening years. Though there is a moderately clever twist involved by the time its revealed after the mind-numbing bloodshed its hard to really care. The movie works better in its wink-wink mockery of the franchise than in its satire of teens and their tech- and media-driven lives. References to social networking texting and viral videos come off as if grown-ups are shaking their heads over the antics of those crazy whippersnappers. The filmmakers subtext -- at least in the movies first quarter -- seems to acknowledge that you cant top the original. And they didnt.

Alison Brie Marley Shelton Adam Brody Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette and Anthony Anderson in Wes Cravens SCREAM4. Photo Gemma La Mana Dimension Films Scream 4 review next generation of menace 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Every horror franchise has its particularly awful killer who operates out of a small town and targets the young and sexually active. Most horror franchises at least for a time have their random lucky person always female who is always the target but never is killed. But only Wes Cravens ""Scream"" series has something extra It takes place in its own world but in our world too one in which young people know every horror movie cliche and can hardly believe it when they suddenly find themselves surrounded by them. In ""Scream 4"" people try to figure who will get killed next based on the movies theyve seen. The script by Kevin Williamson knows that the audience is one step ahead of most slashers so it makes the characters a step ahead too. As we try to outguess the killer the movie sneaks up on us playing off our expectations and sometimes playing into them. Craven and Williamson keep the audience off balance and engaged and they also create sympathy for the characters who arent the born victims you find in other horror movies but savvy people we might know. In the first minutes a young woman talks about horror films and complains about their lack of ""character development."" This is shrewd in that it calls attention to a principal virtue of ""Scream 4"" Characters here might not be as developed as say Pierre in ""War and Peace"" but theyre certainly established with economy and specificity. There are characters in ""Scream 4"" that are onscreen no more than two minutes and yet by the time they leave us its a surprise and not just to them. Fifteen years after the first ""Scream"" the survivors are now in their late 30s and 40s. Neve Campbell is back as Sidney who returns to cozy Woodsboro to promote a book that she has written about her experiences. As the former journalist Gale Weathers Courteney Cox now lives in Woodsboro married to the local sheriff (David Arquette). Meanwhile her books on the Woodsboro tragedies have spawned a movie franchise - seven ""Stab"" movies that are Woodsboros claim to fame. Now just when they think all that violence is over just a memory from the Clinton years it starts up again. The target is once again Sidney or rather everyone Sidney knows which means that her young cousin (Emma Roberts) is being menaced and so are all her friends. So we have two generations in ""Scream 4"" - the scarred adults and the teenagers who until the day before thought slasher movies were funny. Somewhere in here theres almost a social commentary in which the teenagers are presented as technically proficient but to varying degrees morally stunted. One kid walks around with a camera strapped to his head streaming his life on the Internet. The depersonalizing effect of technology and social media not to mention the desensitizing effects of horror movies constitutes one of the underlying themes of the movie. In a world in which everything has been devalued except fame ""sick"" as one characters says ""is the new sane."" Of course Craven and Williamson know that their work is part of the problem and they milk that irony. At the same time they are not guilty of making life cheap. ""Scream 4"" occupies its own space. Its not gross and its not really frightening. It could be called a horror spoof but the deaths arent funny. (In the one place the filmmakers seem to go for a laugh it falls flat.) Though the movie is broad enough to accommodate some absurd turns of story it grabs and holds our attention in a conventional way It makes us care about the characters and worry about whats on the other side of that door. The deaths are agonizing and convincing and at times it almost feels too personal to be watching. ""Scream 4"" is a strange concoction clever and self-knowing in the extreme and yet operating in primal ways that bypass wit. Something about it feels very modern. -- Advisory This film contains strong language gore and violence. Scream 4 Slasher. Starring Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette and Emma Roberts.

In this age of sequels prequels reboots and remakes thats nothing short of a miracle -- and an entertainingly bloody one at that.After a cleverly constructed opening sequence (a mainstay of the series almost on par with the stinger openings of the James Bond movies) that features a film-within-a-film-within-a-film gimmick that goofs on both current horror movie trends and the Scream series itself Scream 4 quickly settles into a fast-paced plot.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns to her hometown of Woodsboro for the first time since the events of the first film. In the 10 years since the events of Scream 3 Sidney has written an autobiography detailing her ordeal as the worlds favorite target of serial killers. Her dramatic foil former TV reporter-turned-novelist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) -- now Gale Riley married to Woodsboros sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) -- is in the grip of writers block brought on by the constraints of small-town life.As soon as Sidney sets foot in town the body count starts to shoot through the roof as the latest incarnation of the killer Ghostface stalks not only Sidney but her teenage cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and her horror-movie-loving high school peers. Faster than you can say ""dont go in there"" a new generation of unfortunate victims is getting hacked slashed and stabbed into the great beyond.When Scream was released in 1996 it was a much-needed product of its time. Horror films had become stagnant thanks to the diminishing returns of countless sequels to the Friday the 13th Halloween and Cravens own Nightmare on Elm Street series. A product of the post-modern tongue-in-cheek 90s Scream satirized what horror had become while simultaneously invigorating it. Its sequels followed suit by mocking the conventions of horror sequels as well as the knock-offs that Scream inspired.Times have changed and the world has become a more cynical ugly place. Audiences tastes in horror are now shaped by the torture porn of the Saw series and the increasingly bloody remakes of past slasher classics. To an extent Scream 4 follows suit; its satirical targets this time around are remakes with the killers goal to re-create the events of the original movie in a contemporary fashion. That means Scream 4 is darker in tone the body count is higher and the kills are surprisingly gorier than in the earlier chapters.The plot is also tighter though it maintains the trademark self-referential wit and dark humor. Craven and Williamson also broaden the scope of their satire taking some well-aimed shots at our obsessions with social networking media and increasingly shallow celebrity culture. A leaner and much meaner sequel that is just as tense and creative as the original Scream 4 is a rare fourth installment that actually moves a series forward instead of backward.Scream 4B Starring Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette Emma Roberts Hayden Panettiere Mary McDonnell Roger Jackson.

Comments click to enlarge Scream 4 Video Rated R  111 minutes  2011 Wes Craven returns to the franchise that resurrected his career and this third sequel may be for him what Operation Shylock was for Philip Roth a hall-of-mirrors narrative in which the artist tries to reconcile his artistic intentions with the misinterpretations of his most bloodthirsty fans. The burden of creative responsibility feels heavier here than in any of the previous installments ditto the trauma of seeing teenagers get stabbed to death. As a result this is quite effective as horror filmmaking and more pungent than anything hes done in a while. The plot concerns the surviving characters from the first three movies (David Arquette Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox the first two displaying credible middle-aged fatigue) investigating a copycat killer whos preying on a new generation of kids. Glibly obsessed with status and social media theyre less sympathetic than any others in the series so far which seems to be intentional.

"Scream 4 Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Kevin WilliamsonMovie review Scream 4The franchise is slicing dicing and laughing again with original stars Neve Campbell Courteney Cox and David Arquette and new faces including Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere.April 15 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Neve Campbell stars in Wes Cravens ""Scream 4."" (MCT )Just when it seemed the joke might be played out along comes ""Scream 4"" with director Wes Craven sharpening his cutting edge and going all meta and physical on us. More precisely for the ""Scream"" series is nothing if not precise in its aim the target is once again most of Woodsboros teen population and the towering stack of slasher sequels that have piled up since the horror satire last got caustic in 2000s ""Scream 3."" Because ""Scream"" just wont let a good thing die Neve Campbell Courteney Cox and David Arquette are back reprising their roles of survivor reporter and cop. The Ghostface killer has resurfaced with a vengeance. And there is a whole new generation of Hollywood talent getting into the act including Emma Roberts Rory Culkin Kristen Bell Anna Paquin and Hayden Panettiere among many many others a names designed to entice a new generation of fans. As ""Scream"" aficionados know (and its fine if you dont; the filmmakers make sure latecomers are welcome) the central question posed by Ghostface a kind of telemarketer of horror is ""Whats your favorite scary movie?"" If ""scary"" is the operative word ""Scream 4"" wont be the answer. The movie pulls off some jump-in-your-seat surprises but hair-raising fear of the Freddy Krueger sort isnt one of them. Which is the price to be paid I guess by a franchise thats always valued its sarcasm as much as its scare. The good news is the satire is in top form with the return of writer Kevin Williamson the clever mind who created the 1996 original ""Scream"" and its not-as-killer 97 sequel (Ehren Kruger managed a decent upgrade on ""Scream 3"" and did an uncredited polish on this one). Any worries that the biting TV adaptation of ""The Vampire Diaries"" on which he is an executive producer might have sucked up all his creative juices can be set aside. Williamson makes the most of every line so much so that it will require multiple watching to get all the allusions. In the decade since we last saw them the main characters have all marinated nicely. Heres where we are in our story Sidney Prescott (Campbell) has always been the one Ghostface is after and that hasnt changed. Though shes always escaped with just cuts and bruises and bad memories anyone else in her vicinity tends to have a life expectancy of somewhere under two hours. Shes turned that pain into a bestseller and is back in that idealized slice of small-town Americana Woodsboro on the anniversary of Ghostfaces original killing spree. Gale Weathers (Cox) the intrepid TV reporter who cracked the first case and went on to write the Stab book series all adapted into films that Woodsboros horror fanatics relish has a bad case of writers block. Meanwhile her marriage to Sheriff Dewey (Arquette) has stalled as well and his promotion to top cop hasnt helped. Roberts sweet teen Jill is a major new addition and Sidneys cousin. Though they really didnt know each other growing up once Ghostface starts picking off Generation Next the girls get close. Jills life looks a lot like Sidneys did back in the day. There are boyfriend troubles with Trevor (moody Nico Tortorella) theres a scary movie club with its top geeks even more tech-savvy with a blog and live video streaming. And Jill has a tight group of girlfriends with Panettieres feisty horror buff Kirby the most intriguing. Director of photography Peter Deming whos been on board the ""Scream"" train since being brought on late in production on the first gives No. 4 its most polished look yet. Though Demings done a variety of work in comedy and drama he is a master at playing with light and sly shifting from long shots to tight shots to sliced shots in campy horror (he also worked on the scary fun of Sam Raimis ""Drag Me to Hell""). Even with all the parody going on Craven the man who has shaped so much of the genre he skewers in ""Scream"" manages to keep the actors from falling into the same trap as they fight and flee and try to unmask whoever the wretch is who has brought Ghostface back. Until this point in the series the killer has always been found out and dispensed with by the time the final credits roll. In fact one of the most satisfying things about ""Scream"" is the way the filmmakers make you wonder about nearly every character a basically youre a suspect until death eliminates you from the game a and the way they clear up all the messy questions of motivation at the end. ""Scream 4"" finds a way to live up to its gory past while it carves out new terrors in new ways (new media helps). The kills themselves are both bountiful and bloody the movie references are brilliant and bloody the funny is very frequent and very frequently bloody but to say any more would ruin the boo. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTina Turner Returns but Its a New Pop WorldJanuary 31 2000Well Youd Scream TooDecember 12 1997MORE STORIES ABOUTKevin WilliamsonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-scream4-20110415,0,7194051.story",200,scream417,scream4,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Sequels are by nature redundant and superfluous. They extend conceits far beyond their logical ending points for commerces sake and recycle ideas until theyve lost whatever novelty attracted audiences to them in the first place. But its rare for a sequel to extensively acknowledge its own pointlessness let alone make the unnecessary nature of its existence a recurring theme the way Scream 4 does. Then again the Scream franchise has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to deconstructing itself and the rules of the slasher genre. Fifteen years in the series now looks more than ever like a Mobius strip that reflects on itself in a perpetual loop. But meta-arbitrary is still arbitrary. Neve Campbell returns as a battle-tested survivor of previous massacres having now channeled her trauma into a memoir that brings her back to her hometown. Emma Roberts co-stars as Campbells cousin a teenager reliving Campbells nightmare when a chatty slasher who has been keeping abreast of recent trends in horror movies begins hacking through the towns hormone-crazed teens in a manner that echoes the bloodbaths of years past. Returning screenwriter Kevin Williamson is considerate enough to put the most trenchant criticism of the film in his own characters mouths like when a character complains that the deaths in slasher sequels have little emotional weight since the characters are so thinly developed. Sure enough the slasher-bait here functions as little more than interchangeable cogs in an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine that pumps out red herrings cheap shocks and twists at a steady clip but provides little actual suspense. Scream 4 goes about its bloody business with impersonal impatient proficiency a reasonably clever script game cast and assured direction make it only as good as it absolutely has to be. Scream 4 doesnt justify its existence creatively but its cynical enough to scoff at the notion that it would even need to do so.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + When ""Scream 3 arrived in 2000 Bill Clinton was still in the White House most cellphones could make only calls reality television was a novelty and Lady Gaga was just some girl named Stefani from the Upper West Side. Everythings changed in the intervening 11 years but sadly not the ""Scream franchise which has coughed up a needless fourth installment that coasts on the winking ironies and Teflon self-awareness of its predecessors. I dont need to tell you ""Scream 4 is unnecessary. The movie spends most of its running time in a state of antic self-justification explaining how the slasher-genre rules that the series so cleverly enumerated now mean nothing because as explained by one of the new movies horror nerds audiences are tired of the old rules. Now they expect something different a reboot.But Kevin Williamson who wrote 75 percent of the franchise and Wes Craven whos directed all of it dont appear to know what different entails. Craven continues to work in the manner of lousy action movies as opposed to landmark horror. If one body is kicked down a flight of stairs wrestled to the floor or hurled through glass they all are. Yes Mr. Craven youve earned your stage-combat merit badge. Cravens understanding of the genre he helped commercialize now appears to boil down to putting jarring noise on the soundtrack and having the actors loiter near doors the way in football some unmanned receivers try to get a busy quarterbacks attention Dude Im open Craven no longer appears to be directing a cast of characters. Collectively theyre a knife block.No one more so than the hilariously hard-to-kill Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). For reasons Im not sure even she gets Sidney returns to the small California town where nutjobs took her mother father boyfriend and pretty much anyone else she ever spoke to or looked at but gave her a hit horror franchise (""Stab) she didnt want. Shes come back to promote her moist new book while her sensation-addicted frenemy the tabloid-TV reporter Gail Weathers (Courteney Cox) is struggling to write another one. The discovery of two dead formerly pert coeds means Sidney gets to protect her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) from the latest stuntpeople wearing hooded ghost-face masks.Sidney is one of the strangest characters to appear in an American movie. She continues to come back to this bloody primal scene and every time the death toll rises she cant believe its happening again. Campbell seems too smart a woman for this be a problem of intelligence. Its more a matter of pathology Will this be the movie I dont survive? Campbell applies her unique battle-weary poise to everything from donkey-kicking approaching assailants to sipping mugs of tea.The movies overpopulated with potential victims and suspects -- Mary McDonnell Anthony Anderson Adam Brody Marley Shelton Rory Culkin on down. The best of them is Hayden Panettiere who plays Jills best friend and wears her hair short and swept back. Panettiere has a tough dignified glamour you rarely see in a slasher-movie blonde. She and the underused Cox are the only two who appear to be enjoying themselves. The first two movies were horror films having a caffeinated conversation with its audience about the genres cliches. Their high-wire act was fun Could a scary movie mock itself and still scare? The limited fun of the third which Ehren Kruger wrote was watching the series cannibalize itself. ""Scream 4 has a smart beginning featuring Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell and one well-delivered line at the end that would have brought down the house in a better movie.But Williamson appears to be at a loss for what hed like to say with a fourth ""Scream beyond ""ka-ching. Eleven years ago Williamson was a still in-demand writer and producer. He had an annoying way with sentence construction but his verbose young people became the model for lots of the verbose young people were still stuck with. Where would the CW be without him? ""Scream 4 feels like the work of people who havent noticed how much popular culture and the horror genre have changed since the first ""Scream arrived in 1996. Despite some topical gags about social media and Channing Tatums erstwhile abs the new movie feels so two decades ago. Yes theres a big speech at the end about how dirt-cheap fame has become in 2011. It sounds desperate nonetheless. Youd believe it a lot more were it delivered by a Kardashian. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris.

From left Marley Shelton Adam Brody Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette and Anthony Andersonin a scene from ""Scream 4.""By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted April 15 2011""How meta can you get?"" wonders Courteney Cox back in old Woodsboro and back as TV reporter-turned-scribe Gale Weathers in Scream 4.The first Scream in 11 years the return of the Ghostface Killer is according to the movie itself either a ""shriekquel"" or a ""screamake."" Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamsons baby is also a reconstructed deconstructionist text on the state of horror movies today and yesterday.Beginning with a series of jokey set pieces in which cameoing Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell (among others) discuss the form and formula of slasher pics and at the same time serve themselves up as potential victims Scream 4 brings together old cast mates (besides Cox Neve Campbell and David Arquette return) and new classmates Emma Roberts Nico Tortorella Hayden Panettiere Erik Knudsen Rory Culkin Marielle Jaffe and Aimee Teegarden.Fresh blood.And the blood gets splattered everywhere.With references to Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho and even Michael Powells Peeping Tom (the first movie ""to show the killers point of view"" were told) Scream 4 is like a perpetual film studies course a reboot with a lesson plan.For genre geeks this can be fun - although nothing in Scream 4 is quite as clever as the filmmakers seem to think it is.Lots has changed over the last decade. Facebook Twitter iPhones texting sexting . . .. Prank calls and fake e-mails are so commonplace theyve become hard to take seriously which creates new challenges for Ghostface and that Im-outside-your-window-wielding-a-butchers-knife m.o. Craven and Williamson milk the social-media stuff for all its worth. Everything in our lives has accelerated they note. Everything that is except the response time of cops en route to a crime scene.Plot? You want plot? Campbells Sydney Prescott swings into town on the last stop of an authors tour to plug her book about being a Ghostface survivor. Arquette is the dim Sheriff Dewey determined to keep the peace on the anniversary of Ghostfaces rampage.But then of course the nut ball in the Munch mask begins to strike again. And again. And again.Do Woodsboro Highs film nerds (Culkin Knudsen) have something to do with the killings? What about Sydneys publicist (Alison Brie)? And whats going on with Trevor (Tortorella) the dude all the girls are talking about?One bloody filleting begets another. And one of the deputies is named Anthony Perkins.Class discuss.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

JOHNSON  kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com  314-340-8191 Apr 14 2011 (...) A scene from ""Scream 4"" (Dimension Films) Dimension Films From left Marley Shelton Adam Brody Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette and Anthony Anderson in ""Scream 4"" (Dimension Films) Scream 4"" has just about everything a fan could want out of the ""Scream"" series -- and thats just in the first 10 minutes.Dont be late to this homecoming of director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamsons horror series which begins with a twisty opening sequence thats bloody fun.Right off the top ""Scream 4"" serves up the requisite menacing phone calls; an unusually high array of TV and movie stars stabbed to death by Ghostface; homages to Drew Barrymores and Rose McGowans death scenes from the original and appropriate updates with text and Facebook stalking. As smart as it is sick the megameta ""Scream 4"" brings back Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who survived the three previous ""Scream"" movies to her hometown of Woodsboro. Shes there for the local stop on the book tour for her best-seller ""Out of Darkness.""Still in Woodsboro are married couple Dewey (David Arquette) and Gail Riley (Courteney Cox). Dewey has been promoted to sheriff but Gail a best-selling author herself has severe writers block.Sidneys return signals a whole new lineup of murders in Woodsboro this time circling around Sidneys younger cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and her high school friends including Kirby (Hayden Panettiere sporting a horrible haircut) Olivia (Marielle Jaffe) Charlie (Rory Culkin) and Trevor (Nico Tortorella).The fresh stream of blood rejuvenates Gail but puts a strain on her relationship with Dewey.Much of it builds toward Woodsboros annual but improbable Stab-a-Thon event set up by the high schools cinema club. The kids dress up walking around in Ghostface costumes and Barrymore wigs and watch all the ""Stab"" movies ""Rocky Horror Picture Show""-style. (Youll remember the ""Stab"" series as the movies-within-the-movies based on the Woodsboro murders. Here theyre humorously up to seven installments including one featuring time travel.)Cast members die off quickly and sometimes spectacularly and horror movie rules dont always matter. Of course the cop who goes into the house to check on things is killed. Gay characters never die as one character says but when a character declares hes gay at the last minute to save his life hes killed anyway. The big reveal of who done it (he? she? they?) is a relevant twist that speaks to a particularly obsessive sign of the times.Though overlong for a horror movie and too self-aware (are scary movies all people talk about and watch in this town?) ""Scream 4"" provides a perfect continuation of the series a fitting throwback to the original.Its funny and scary at the same time and fans will ""Scream"" with approval.""Scream 4""Three stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 149  Content Strong bloody violence language and teen drinking Poll Whats your favorite scary movie?

TWITTER The latest in Wes Cravens horror franchise works in a new generational mix of actors but Neve Campbell too often seems stranded with little to do until the climax. A scattering of amusing bits and clever twists cant forestall the terminal self-deconstruction that dominates Scre4m. After an 11-year slumber Ghostface returns to action along with the principal creative team and key lead actors and unsurprisingly goes into overdrive to make up for lost time. But the film very quickly and tediously becomes more of the same old and Craven thing--self-referential film buff gags accompanied by a clockwork killing spree that seriously reduces the population of a small town. Strong anticipation by series fans and a high body count all but guarantee an opening weekend box office killing followed by fairly rapid theatrical fall-off and robust home viewing life. Fifteen years after her first encounter with the taunting black-hooded anguished-faced knife freak Neve Campbells Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro (represented now by an amalgam of towns in Michigan) to promote her book Out of Darkness which purports to express her coming to terms with the dreadful ordeals she survived and are now presumably safely in the past. With the town square festooned with the ghouls likeness hanging from every lamppost her celebrity is not lost on Ghostface whos sufficiently inspired by her homecoming to sharpen his blades and further extend an already considerable reputation. However this cant happen until director Wes Craven and series originator and screenwriter Kevin Williamson set the teasing tone by sampling some of the seven legendary ""Stab"" movies inspired by the towns real-life murders. The creeps pattern remains more or less the same Taunting verbal abuse to nubile high school girls over the phone sometimes climaxed by the phrase ""This is the last person youll ever gonna see alive."" This time the trio of most likely suspects includes Sidneys cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) who fawns over her famous relative and her friends Olivia (Marielle Jaffe) and Kirby (Hayden Panettiere) the latter being the hottest film nerd ever seen onscreen even if the lively actress playing her looks to be covered in an alarming oversupply of orange suntan spray. Back for more are Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers the author who sees the new killing spree as a chance to bust out of her severe writers bloc a depression that might be connected to the fact that shes married to the sweatily incompetent Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) whos never where he needs to be at the right time. Individual scenes have passing energy and jokiness even if nearly all of the latter is highly insular in the way it self-consciously references horror genre tropes and the series own history. But the narrative doesnt build the way it should in a good suspense film; just as it seems that the climax has arrived in a big Stab-A-Thon night at which dozens of horror geeks have congregated to watch the series while Ghostface is on a new tear through town the film downshifts as it prepares to string out the last series of murders as long as it can before the final revelations (not bad) about whos behind the mask this time and why. At 111 minutes this goes on far too long for its own good but then the previous three did too so hardcore fans wont mind. The generational mix of actors works well enough although Campbell too often seems stranded with little to do until the climax.

Phone conversations are for like lameos. Still it?s nice to know that in Scream 4 the preferred communication tool for the knifewielding melty-masked killer known to Scream fans and Halloween revelers as Ghostface is still a phone equipped with the loud standard brrrrrnnng that predates the invention of downloadable ringtones from Wiz Khalifa. After all watching the infamous butcher text ?What?s your favorite scary movie?? to each nubile glossy-haired teen princess before showing up to slash and dash her doesn?t carry the same kick as hearing that bossy sewer voice. The makers of Scream 4 know that their comedy-horror flick has a lot of explaining to do I?d start with the question Why is Ghostface back when we haven?t thought about him for a decade -- and when today?s young gorehounds may never have even thought about Scream before? Answer Because it?s a brand. Maybe a new generation will go for it? And so arriving 11 years seven Saws four Scary Movies two Rings and one Shaun of the Dead after Scream 3 the fourth installment (marketed as a hip ?reboot? rather than an average ?sequel?) responds not with quality logic but with a massive quantity of amusing winky meta. ?Sequels don?t know when to stop? one movie-buff character clarifies. Channing Tatum Top Chef Daniel Radcliffe and Facebook are among the namechecked. A Mac laptop receives prominent placement. Some of the riffs are really funny and/or expertly scary. Others have the feel of awfully snappy dialogue crafted by middleaged people trying a little too eagerly to sound like the young people from whose mouths the banter flows. (The movie was written by Kevin Williamson 46 and directed by 71-year-old Wes Craven -- both four-time Scream vets.) Still the tour de force funny/ scary opener is better (and more surprisepacked) than any since Drew Barrymore picked up that phone of doom in 1996. It?s a giddy reminder of everything that made Scream such a fresh scream in the first place. And the story premise is neat Having published a self-help book about how she has as Oprah might say moved on after outwitting every previous Ghostface who ever lunged her way Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell looking uncommonly lovely) returns to promote her tome in her hometown of Woodsboro. Old Screamers Deweythe-cop (David Arquette) and Gale-thejournalist (Courteney Cox) now married are there to greet her. So is Sidney?s teenage niece Jill (Emma Roberts). And so conveniently is Jill?s collection of glossy friends and classmates each ripe for slaughter or at least struggle now that Sidney?s back in town. Among the potential targets Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin stand out as a snarky party girl and an avid movie geek. In her own corner of the frame Alison Brie (Community Mad Men) happily goes for the jugular as Sidney?s aggressive young book publicist. I?ll say no more about what comes later except to note that about halfway into the movie Scream 4?s forward motion seems to stall around the same time that the riffs and R-rated bloody knifings become more ornate and self-conscious. And by the end (or ends actually -- the plot resolution is the weakest part of the machine) the movie is for all intents and purposes carried out on a stretcher just like one of the characters. But not before it has accomplished one of its most melancholy-inducing feats of meta something with which no previous Scream has ever had to grapple. The truly frightening killer this time isn?t Ghostface but time. The real Grim Reaper. The ticktock no successful movie franchise can escape. Sidney is a woman now no longer the girl she was and Neve Campbell is no longer the ingenue. The pretty young players who populate Woodsboro 2011 know it?s their turn now thank you very much. ?You were my ?90s? one of those young things says to Cox?s Gale. Nostalgic for the days when Ghostface was everyone?s ?90s the makers of Scream 4 revisit old haunts where it turns out the technology is newfangled but Ghostface is long in the tooth. B?

The first follow-up to the original trilogy in a decade ""Scream 4"" proves too much of a once-good thing. Overblown overlong and overstuffed with genre self-referentialism yet undercooked in terms of credibility worthwhile new characters and memorable scares its not the razor-sharp reboot fans were hoping for. Nonetheless their anticipation should make for stellar opening numbers worldwide and the pic delivers enough of the expected goods if seldom with the wit or panache of the series best to avoid total word-of-mouth kill-off. Ancillary returns will be terrific. Scenarist Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven whose continued teaming has kept the bar fairly high deliciously exploited and parodied slasher-pic tropes in the original ""Scream"" (1996). The following years ""Scream 2"" was arguably even better with 2000s third part weaker but still enjoyable. If ""Scream 4"" seems the nadir to date that may be partly because fans have had years to ratchet up expectations -- and because its predecessors were at least a few brain cells above other long-running horror franchises. But mostly pic disappoints because its wit feels tuckered out and various cards are drastically overplayed by the end. The opening pushes Williamsons acknowledged ""whole postmodern meta shit"" (as several characters put it) to strained excess. Three successive pairs of young women (Lucy Hale and Shenae Grimes Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell Aimee Teegarden and Brittany Robertson) suffer the usual phone call-preluded fates at the hands of the Ghostface Killer (voiced once again by Roger Jackson with body by stuntman Dane Farwell). The first duos turn out to be mere characters from previous scenes of the endless ""Stab"" slasher series inspired by the original ""Woodsboro Murders"" and related books by opportunistic reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Unfortunately the third pair are present-day Woodsboro high schoolers home alone watching ""Stab"" movies when the phone rings. The grisly results arent discovered until the next day when perennial Ghostface prime target Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is back in town for the first time in a decade. Shes kicking off a book tour for her own tale of survival and when news hits of a copycat killer (or killers as is apparent early on) shes horrified. Due to investigative procedure her old pal Dewey Riley (David Arquette) now sheriff cant let her leave town even if her presence imperils everyone else. Among those overexcited by this turn of events are Deweys restless small-town spouse Gale -- whos tapped out her journalistic cash cow and itches to regain the spotlight -- as well as Sidneys publicist Rebecca (Alison Brie) who views new murders in terms of skyrocketing book sales. Under police protection Sidney stays with her aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell scantly used) and young cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). Other major characters this time around include Jills best friends Kirby (unflatteringly coiffed Hayden Panettiere) and Olivia (Marielle Jaffe); her creepy stalker-ish ex-boyfriend Trevor (Nico Tortorella); their high schools horror-obsessed film club geeks (Erik Knudsen Rory Culkin); and Woodsboro deputies Perkins (Anthony Anderson) Hoss (Adam Brody) and Hicks (Marley Shelton) the last infatuated with Dewey. Needless to say given the body count few of these thesps need keep their schedules cleared for ""Scream 5."" Throughout characters behave stupidly -- strolling outside houses visiting friends sitting in open-windowed cars despite known danger -- which might be amusing if this were ""Scary Movie 5."" But instead were asked to simply swallow all gaping credulity gaps straight. ""How meta can you get?"" Gale asks at one point and ""Scream 4"" answers too much. Direct references to other movies and antic discussions of slasher rules feel like tired shtick here despite the odd zesty line. Williamson tries to keep things up-to-date by emphasizing communication technologies not yet widespread during earlier chapters -- camera phones video blogging texting et al. -- but that too feels so five minutes ago. A villains climactic speech critiques a new generations sense of entitlement and addiction to fame in ham-fisted fashion. And all this happens before a second climax prolongs ""Scream 4"" even further. Agreeable veteran thesps were more so when the writing was better; newbies are fine within script-prescribed limits. Packaging is slick though Peter Demings widescreen lensing neednt have been quite so gauzy.

Scream 4 Bad to Fair Director Wes Craven. Cast Neve Campbell Courteney Cox David Arquette. Rating R for strong bloody violence language and some teen drinking. Guide to this weeks new releases Stars who met their makers Scream-ing Unless youre Wes Craven in which case its not enough. Thats the point he and screenwriter Kevin Williamson seem to be driving home with ""Scream 4"" the latest installment in the self-aware horror franchise that hasnt seen a new offering in 10 years. Until now with a fast-starting film that quickly piles meta self-referential elements on top of each other until they no longer make much sense and the whole thing collapses under the weight of its own coolness. While theres some fun to be had in seeing the older not necessarily wiser characters from the earlier films trying to escape the Ghostface killers blade most of the movie is an exercise in horror-movie cliches - which we are supposed to forgive and even enjoy because the film and the people in it know this. Wink nod repeat. Thats the hallmark of the ""Scream"" movies right? There are rules we are constantly reminded. It was an original notion in the first film but - and we are reminded of this several times as well - the rules have changed. Evidently that means movies like those in the ""Saw"" franchise have upped the gore ante while sacrificing genuine scares. But a real scare is another casualty of the premise. Almost everything is telegraphed - rules again - so that its almost impossible to really frighten the audience. We can see it coming because theyre always talking about it. The film starts out in promising fashion with another trademark opening scene. Or scenes actually a film within a film within a film that includes Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell among others playing off both ""Scream"" and ""Stab"" the movie series within the movie inspired by the ""real"" events. Its fun its somewhat surprising and scary and gets across in about 10 minutes what Craven spends the rest of the film trying to impart without as much success. Its been 10 years since the killings and perpetual victim Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has written a book about her experiences. For the last stop on her promotional tour she returns to Woodsboro the scene of the original crimes accompanied by her take-no-prisoners publicist Rebecca (Alison Brie). Everyone in town remembers the killings of course - thanks to the ""Stab"" film franchise based on books by former reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) they are woven into the fabric of the place with high-school kids staging marathon viewings of all seven of the movies. Gale is married to Dewey Riley (David Arquette) now the town sheriff and if possible dumber than before. Unfortunately for him and given his crime-solving skills the soon-to-be-dwindling population of Woodsboro once Sidney gets back to town the killings start all over again. This time the young pretty teens with ""potential victims"" all but written on their foreheads include Kirby (Hayden Panettiere) Olivia (Marielle Jaffe) and Jill (Emma Roberts) - Sidneys cousin. The creepy phone calls the horror-movie references (even the horror movies; a bit of ""Shaun of the Dead"" is shown) the growing pile of bodies mean no one is safe. Again. This time around Craven and Williamson have added some preaching about the perils of cheaply won fame and tossed in a little social media as well. Nothing is real today unless its recorded and posted though theres more talk about that than the actual doing of it. Ultimately ""Scream 4"" comes off as more self-satisfied than self-reflexive which turns out to be less satisfying than youd hope. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

There is a particular sort of stupid-acting-smart movie experience that can be achieved only through the reunion of David Arquette Courteney Cox and Neve Campbell. Updated for 2011 with ad nauseam cell-phone app and webcam references--none of which are integrated into the narrative with any savvy--the unengaged and overlong fourth Scream plops its self-awareness on a new generation who must endure a late-90s flashback thats aged as well as the Nu-metal songbook. Sidney (Campbell) returns to her hometown on a book tour promoting her survivors memoir. On cue Woodsboro High Schools student body begins to dwindle; among those threatened are the teen understudies of the original cast including Sidneys cousin played by Emma Roberts. Returning to his franchise after its decade in hibernation director Wes Craven stays remarkably true to the spirit of the first film--as well he might since the slow-pitch postmodernism of the originals script by Kevin Williamson (the screenwriter for 4 as well) revived Cravens listless career allowing him to make dream projects about Meryl Streep and violins. The enjoyable moments are limited to Alison Brie funny as Sidneys publicist and the final recasting of the movie as a backstage diva drama. As ever the self-reflexive horror stuff is superficial loveless and constant--a ladled-on sauce to disguise what youre eating.
