That it does so while also making high-school soccer look like the best-funded most rabidly supported sport in America is all the more impressive. Drawn from the early life of the Shue clan (Elisabeth along with sib Andrew is a costar and coproducer) and set inevitably in the 70s the film follows the titular adolescent heroine (Schroeder) as she copes with the loss of her beloved soccer-star older brother and strives to take his place on the all-male team. Shes opposed by the swaggering players including a mulleted lothario (Shand) as well as her cynical downcast dad (the excellent Mulroney) and mousy mom (Shue). Things proceed less than swimmingly and its to the films credit that Gracie is presented as a gifted but slapdash player rather than some improbable savant. Director Davis Guggenheims signature combination of emotional restraint and earthy visuals also gives Gracie an unexpected grandeur and nearly mitigates its climactic ""put me in the game coach"" switcheroo.

Gracie No score | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGracie No scoreGracie is a well-meaning little film. Thats not a compliment.By Marlene ArpePop Culture writerFri. June 22 2007 (out of 4)Directed by Davis Guggenheim. Written by Lisa Marie Petersen and Karen Janszen. Starring Dermot Mulroney Carly Schroeder Elisabeth Shue. 92 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Article Continued BelowGracie is a well-meaning little film. Thats not a compliment. Based loosely on the family story of actor Elisabeth Shue this tale of a teenage girl wanting to play soccer with the boys after her adored older brother dies has been in the works for a long time. In interviews Shue and her brother Andrew have talked about the importance of the project.Its a great disappointment then that this family labour of love which has the brother and sister starring and Shues husband Davis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth) directing as well as another brother co-producing ends up more like a middling after-school special than an insightful look at family dynamics. It goes to show that sometimes the people closest to a potentially poignant story are not the best to bring that story it to an audience.Carly Schroeder in the title role does a good job with the cliched lines she is given and Dermot Mulroney grey-haired and weary is okay as her surly father who belatedly comes to believe that his daughter can compete.While the soccer is the best thing about Gracie good sports footage does not a great sports movie make. The filmmakers dont trust us to figure out the ham-fisted message about setting yourself free by persevering and soaring out into the world. So they provide Gracie with a pet bird in a cage. Will the bird be let out? Can you stand the tension? But worse than all that Gracie fails the litmus test of a good sports movie (this theory excludes Bull Durham and Major League) It doesnt make you cry. Brians Song Million Dollar Baby Cinderella Man Field of Dreams and countless others are like great big movie onions. Even recent run-of-the-mill football yarn Invincible was able to draw a few tears. When the grand finale rolls around and young Gracie finally gets to show her skills on the pitch you know youre supposed to get choked up. But perhaps because its difficult to cry while youre rolling your eyes.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Movie review Showtimes ""Gracie"" with Carly Schroeder Elisabeth Shue Dermot Mulroney Andrew Shue. Directed by Davis Guggenheim from a screenplay by Karen Janszen and Lisa Marie Peterson. 90 minutes. Rated PG-13 for brief sexual content. Sports movies about girls are still such relative rarities that ""Gracie"" arrives with built-in good will. Its inspired by a real-life story actress Elisabeth Shues experiences playing soccer on an all-boys league as a preteen. And the film is a family affair Shue and brother Andrew co-star; Andrew also produced and Elisabeths husband Davis Guggenheim (""An Inconvenient Truth"") directed. Thats a lot of warm-and-fuzzy for one movie but ""Gracie"" pretty much succeeds in maintaining the good vibes. Its helped by a spirited likable performance by Carly Schroeder in the title role as a teen in a soccer-playing family whos frustrated when her father (Dermot Mulroney) thinks she isnt tough enough to play on a boys team. (Theres no girls team at her school where the authorities try to shuffle her off to field hockey.) At first Gracies older brother Johnny (Jesse Lee Soffer) also a soccer star encourages her but when hes suddenly killed in a tragic accident shes left alone with her dreams. That death and Gracies subsequent acting-out gives ""Gracie"" some pretty heavy subject matter for a family movie; parents should note that this isnt a lighthearted film and that for a while Gracies shown sneaking into bars and making out in cars with strangers. (Its reminiscent for a short time mid-movie of ""Thirteen."") But soon the focus goes back to sports and to Gracies determination to prove herself when shes finally won both her fathers attention and a chance to try out for the boys team. The movies final half-hour is mostly predictable in the way that sports dramas virtually always are right down to the kid in the stands who helpfully explains the game for the audiences benefit. But there are some powerful moments (such as Elisabeth Shue as Gracies mother giving a touching unexpected speech about how she doesnt share her familys competitive spirit) and by its end ""Gracie"" earns its cheers.

Bailey Todays lesson of the day -- you go girl 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Gracie Sports drama. Starring Elisabeth Shue Carly Schroeder and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Davis Guggenheim. (PG-13. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Gracie"" is being billed as a soccer film but it often seems as if the boys and girls are playing a completely different game in the high school sports movie. The rules fall somewhere between hockey and Thunderdome as the lead character gets kicked and punched in the face at separate times with no penalty called. After watching the rough play and horrible sportsmanship displayed by some of the characters in this film football -- or even jumping over buses with a motorcycle -- might seem like a safer pastime for your 16-year-old. Sporadic on-field violence is only a tiny reason that ""Gracie"" disappoints but its indicative of the films greater problem. Producers Elisabeth and Andrew Shue seem so intent on creating a hero out of the main character and villains out of almost everyone else that theyve completely distorted reality. Its Gracie against the world in a pile of sports movie cliches and even the teens parents spend much of the movie berating their daughter. ""Youre not tough enough. Theyre going to cream you. Its not going to happen"" Gracies father says a few scenes before her mother piles on with a gratuitous youre-just-a-girl-you-cant-play-soccer speech. The plucky high schoolers best friend little brothers potential suitor and the high schools head coach take turns ridiculing her as well. The script failures are a shame because at the core of the movie is a good story. Gracie is the only girl in a family full of boys in 1978 when the gender equality in sports initiative Title IX was on the books but clearly not in the public consciousness in New Jersey. Played by the relatively inexperienced but talented Carly Schroeder the main character has a lot of winning qualities. But a too-predictable tragedy happens early in the film and then Gracie goes wild. Angry at her parents (played by Elisabeth Shue and Dermot Mulroney) who wont let their daughter try out for the boys soccer team she resorts to sneaking out shoplifting smoking cigarettes and getting busy in muscle cars with shady characters. Imagine watching ""Rudy"" if the middle third consisted of Sean Astin getting felt up in the back of a 1974 Plymouth Barracuda. Not only are these scenes poorly conceived theyre repetitious derailing the ""Hoosiers""-with-a-soccer-ball vibes and replacing them with the alarmist qualities of an ABC ""After-School Special"" (maybe the one where Helen Hunt smokes PCP). By the time we get back on the sports movie train -- even Gracies parents stop belittling her and come on board -- the faults of the plot have already been exposed. The last 20 minutes are particularly frustrating with the obligatory ""Footloose""-style appeal-to-the-school-board scene and some completely illogical behavior on the soccer field that was written with no regard for character continuity. Only the crowd-pleasing ending is a welcome sight serving as a reminder of the good intentions behind the project. Everyone who made this movie had his or her heart in the right place even though they got so much wrong. -- Advisory This film contains adult language sports violence and sexual situations. The appearance of Andrew Shue as a soccer coach may be jolting to ""Melrose Place"" fans who arent used to seeing him without Courtney Thorne-Smith yelling at him next to a swimming pool.

BY Elizabeth Weitzmandaily News Writer Friday June 1 2007 400 AM ""Gracie"" Story set in the 70s of a teenage girl who fights for a spot on her schools all-male soccer team. With Carly Schroeder Dermot Mulroney. Director Davis Guggenheim (132). PG-13 Mild sexuality. At area theaters. If heartstring-tugging were a varsity sport director Davis Guggenheim would make team captain. The question is do you want to be on the field when he tramples all over your emotions? Having earned accolades (and an Oscar) for his documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"" Guggenheim finds less success in the fictional terrain of this inspirational sports drama which is based partly on the experiences of his wife actress Elisabeth Shue. ""Gracies"" strongest asset is appealing lead Carly Schroeder who plays 15-year-old Grace. The only girl in a large family Grace has watched her father Bryan (Dermot Mulroney) train his boys to be competitive soccer players. After her oldest brother dies Grace decides to try out for his spot on the high-school soccer team. This being 1978 her announcement is met by reactions that range from polite dismissal to cruel mockery. Elisabeth Shue Schroeder and Dermot Mulroney in Gracie. Grace takes the rejection hard and turns her efforts from self-fulfillment to self-destruction. When she spends a few too many nights chasing trouble Dad relents and offers to train her. But is his wayward daughter strong enough to convince the school board - not to mention the team itself - that shes got what it takes? I dont want to ruin any surprises but when Grace allows her caged pet bird to fly free its safe to assume shes ready to spread her own wings. There is so much potential in this project that its especially dispiriting to watch Guggenheim cave in to cliches. (A caged bird? Really?) Characters communicate through declarations like ""You can do anything"" and ""I am tough enough"" The plot follows a path so well-trod Schroeder needs her cleats just to dig in. And given that they co-produced the film its hard to guess why Elisabeth and her brother Andrew (last seen on ""Melrose Place"") choose to fade into the background as Graces bland mother and teacher respectively. A nicely confident Schroeder strides though the movie as if its a masterpiece and Mulroney is equally charismatic. But they cant quite save ""Gracie"" from feeling like a vanity project that will appeal mostly to middle-school soccer teams and various extended members of the Shue family. elyzawaol.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Gracie (Carly Schroeder center) has good soccer skills as well as a spunky spirit in Gracie. Photo Picturehouse Gracie 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Gracie a tale about a teen girl blazing trails in soccer is worthy but its also formulaic to a fault. Like Rocky Rudy and others Gracie (Carly Schroeder) needs tough-love training and rigorous discipline to whip herself into shape. Also like them shes walloped by opponents only to dust herself off and inspire us. Set in 1978 her story was inspired by actress Elisabeth Shue who pushed her way into a male-only sport at the same New Jersey high school featured in the film. Shue plays Gracies supportive mom husband Davis Guggenheim directs and brother Andrew Shue produced and plays a soccer coach. The kinships dont excuse the films many cliches from a big kick in the big game to the defiant stance required to get there. Gracie also cheapens its feminism with male bullying. When its heroine tries out for an all-boys team shes intimidated by a nose-bloodying attack. Its not dirty play because its not play -- its assault. But the coaches and even her own dad (Dermot Mulroney) shrug it off. Thats not what soccer is about; a single head-butt inflamed last years World Cup final. Its a rigorous game of skill and stamina and its galling to see sensationalistic brutality. The boys villainy is supposed to make Gracie even more of an inspirational underdog. But it makes her a victim as well and Gracie becomes punishing rather than uplifting. It also includes self-destructive detours. Mothers of young girls beware. Schroeder still shines demonstrating a resilient spunky spirit along with soccer chops and rising to the challenge with soulful resolve. Her characters dark side is underwritten but shes clearly got the guts and to hang in there. Gracie is dedicated to the Shues late brother but it should have been dedicated to Elisabeth. Thanks to her and others who dared to be first millions of girls play soccer in the United States today. The historical weight compensates for hackneyed melodrama nudging us to cheer despite our reservations. And in a summer of heavy hitters a small film like Gracie is an underdog itself. But not all underdogs are created equally and Gracies raw extremes make it tough to embrace. Just because a sport or a sports film is meant to be taken seriously doesnt mean it cant also be fun. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Refurb Samsung 55"" 4K LED LCD UHD Smart TV for 550 + free...

Knowing that going in - that ""Gracie"" is a fairly typical overcoming-disaster sports movie aimed squarely at 12- year-old girls with a fierce sense of equality or perchance superiority - being aware of all this will enhance your enjoyment of a mediocre film. ""Gracie"" is a well-made movie with a chip on its shoulder but it never quite pays off the promising sense of gloom and realism that first draws us in. As played by Carly Schroeder Gracie is tough defiant attractive determined and plausibly athletic growing up in a family that ignores her at best and ridicules her at worst. Yet instead of building on that material to take us in new directions with a real-life spice girl ""Gracie"" gets stuck in a repetitive series of training montages and juvenile acting-up. The ending will be inspiring to that shin-kicking niece but laughably unrealistic to any athlete whos ever tried to bend one inside the near post. ""Gracie"" is a family project of the New Jersey Shues who produced Elisabeth Shue and her Academy Award nomination for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and Andrew Shue a former professional soccer player and one of the resident hunks on ""Melrose Place."" The whole family was soccer-gonzo with Elisabeth becoming one of the earliest female stars in New Jerseys youth leagues. Older brother William was the best of the bunch according to the Shues but died in a car accident in the 1980s. Since then Andrew Shue wanted to make a movie honoring his brother and the familys soccer roots using Elisabeths story as a way in. Luckily for Andrew Elisabeth married director Davis Guggenheim who took time out of from Oscar-winning documentaries (""An Inconvenient Truth"") to helm the fictional ""Gracie."" When Gracies older brother dies in the film father Dermot Mulroney and mother (Elisabeth Shue herself) are devastated and ignore Gracie even more than usual. She takes up soccer to prove her worth and eventually asks her dads help in training to join the local high school boys team (Title IX not yet having delivered the equality of a girls squad). The basic story is fine; my problems are in the usual sports-movie peripherals. The high school boys are all exaggeratedly cruel; the parents are predictably clueless; town leaders are predictably stodgy. Gracie goes from klutz to clutch in a few easy minutes. The sound- track however is top-notch crammed with 70s and 80s radio hits - any movie that picks Springsteens ""Growin Up"" for the right spot gains field position in my book. Take the neighborhood girls and get their view. Theyll appreciate that Gracie is a real person as comfortable drawing a yellow card as she is drawing on eyeliner. A truly winning American soccer movie has yet to be made but ""Gracie"" is good enough to play for a tie. Staff writer Michael Booth can be reached at mboothdenverpost.com.

"For the love of family and a game in Gracie - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW For the love of family and a game in Gracie In ""Gracie"" Carly Schroeder (center) plays the title character a determined teenager who takes her brothers place on the boys varsity soccer team after he dies in an auto accident. (K.C. BAILEY/2007 PICTUREHOUSE) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  June 1 2007 The 16-year-old actress Carly Schroeder has a stare that could burn through stone or the heart of a soccer referee. Shes a blond bruiser in an industry that celebrates sylphs and sticks but for much of ""Gracie "" the title character cant throw her weight around the way she knows she was meant to. So Schroeder stares and seethes until the other characters catch fire.""Gracie"" is an inspirational sports movie soccer subdivision and it stops at every expected station of the cross on its road to the triumphant against-all-odds finale (in sudden-death overtime yet). Yet it also feels appealingly handmade in a way most jock dramas dont. Its a family affair about a family -- produced by and co-starring Elisabeth Shue (""Leaving Las Vegas"" ) and her brother Andrew (""Melrose Place"" ) directed by her husband Davis Guggenheim (who made the Al Gore documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"")  and based apparently on some fairly heavy Shue clan lore.Gracie Bowen (Schroeder) is the only girl in a family of boys all soccer freaks under the stern guidance of their father Bryan (Dermot Mulroney ). Is he a sports nazi? Well yes. Do they love him for it? Yes although varsity star oldest brother Johnny (Jesse Lee Soffer ) is doing it more for dad than for love of the game.Johnny dies in an auto accident though -- his death is so baldly telegraphed that my own 12-year-old soccer player and I looked at each other in the dark and whispered ""lunchmeat"" -- and a crushed Gracie concocts a plan. Shell take Johnnys place on the field.The year is 1978 the setting rough-and-tumble northern New Jersey and the taunts are cruel. Even Gracies father thinks its a stupid idea. The most interesting part of ""Gracie"" is the long midsection in which the heroine is kept from playing and turns incoherent with sullen rebellion cranking up the Thin Lizzy tunes and smoking cigarettes with dead-end eyes.Eventually she gets her chance -- thank you Title IX and that nice lady on the school board -- but the grueling training (with dad) and try outs (with a disbelieving coach played by John Doman ) lead to brutish behavior from teammates like Kyle (Christopher Shand ) who can only conceive of Gracie as girlfriend material.""Gracie"" in other words doesnt make it easy and thats a change from the rote moves of films like 2005s glossy ""Goal "" Its more working-class than ""Bend It Like Beckham "" too -- not a feel-good movie but a desperate-to-feel-anything movie at times nearly hysterical with adolescent yearning. Not for nothing does Bruce Springsteens ""Growing Up "" keen repeatedly on the soundtrack.For all the predictability (and you can set your watch by it) Schroeder roots the film with her glower; theres nothing actressy about her. Mulroney just about makes up for ""Georgia Rule ."" The more interesting performance though may be Elisabeth Shues . She plays Gracies mother Lindsay  a school nurse whos the only non-jock in the bunch and who watches her only daughter move further and further away from her.Lindsay gets a little speech in the film about this -- about how its lonely to be a mother to such a family and how thats all right -- and you wonder how much of the actresss own mother is in that speech. According to the press notes soccer runs in the Shue blood Elisabeth broke local gender barriers by playing on boys teams and there was an older brother who died young. Even the movies biggest metaphorical groaner a wild kestrel kept in a cage and finally set free is based on an actual bird.To which the critic has to say So what? Does ""Gracie"" work as a movie? Just close enough and closer still for a young soccer player who may already know her sports movie cliches but also recognizes when they touch on something once and truly felt.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

""Gracie"" is the sort of formulaic feel-good sports drama that requires collaborators on either side of the camera to be at the absolute top of their game to score any kind of impact. Unfortunately this modestly engaging but thoroughly predictable Picturehouse release appears hopelessly outmatched by bigger and better-hyped competitors in the summer B.O. sweepstakes. Playoff potential may be brighter in the homevid arena if favorable word of mouth spreads. Pic is something of a family affair co-produced by helmer Davis Guggenheim -- director of the Oscar-winning docu ""An Inconvenient Truth"" -- with his actress wife Elisabeth Shue and actor brother-in-law Andrew Shue. (Indie vet Lemore Syvan also shares producing credit.) The script by Lisa Marie Petersen and Karen Janszen is loosely based on a real-life tragedy -- specifically the accidental death of William Shue brother of Elisabeth and Andrew (and executive producer John Shue) -- but the film focuses primarily on an eponymous protagonist modeled after Elisabeth whos effectively cast as the characters mother. Despite all the factual underpinning most of ""Gracie"" plays like conventional Hollywood-style contrivance. In 1978 South Orange N.J. 15-year-old Gracie Bowen (Carly Schroeder) must overcome sexist mindsets hidebound bureaucracy and -- initially at least -- unsupportive parents as she sets out to replace her late brother on her high school varsity soccer team. Only auds not exposed to similar inspirational sports scenarios will doubt for a second that shell eventually succeed. On the plus side up-and-comer Schroeder makes a winning impression as Gracie a working-class rebel who tries to become a team player after her beloved brother Johnny (Jesse Lee Soffer) -- a star athlete coached by his proud father -- dies in an auto accident. Thesp persuasively conveys her characters innate seriousness of purpose even when shes acting out talking back and risking her virginity by vamping ""older"" (i.e. college-age) guys. Latter activity though emotionally and dramatically credible may unsettle some parents whod otherwise consider the pic as family-friendly entertainment. At first Bryan Bowen (Dermot Mulroney) refuses to train his daughter. He claims unreasonably that Gracie simply isnt tough enough to play with the boys. Lindsay (Elisabeth Shue) the teens tradition-bound mom attempts to douse Gracies nascent feminism. (""Not everything is possible"" Lindsay not-so-helpfully warns.) Even Jena (scene-stealing Julia Garro) Gracies guy-crazy best friend is outspokenly discouraging noting that femme athletes their age are widely viewed as ""lesbos."" In the end of course everyone even crusty Coach Colasanti (John Doman who uncovers kernels of truth in a cliched role) becomes a believer just in time for Gracie to take part in a climactic match a game that has at least a patina of verisimilitude thanks to soccer choreographer Dan Metcalfe. Mulroney is surprisingly affecting as he charts his characters gradual change of heart. Lenser Chris Manley production designer Dina Goldman and costumer Elizabeth Caitlin Ward are most valuable players when it comes to sustaining period ambiance. Indeed there are some scenes early on that actually look like they were excerpted from a pic produced during the Polyester Era. Soundtrack includes aptly chosen 70s pop tunes with Aretha Franklins ""Rock Steady"" imaginatively employed to underscore Gracies grueling training regimen. Closing credits which proclaim ""Gracie"" is ""a carbon neutral production"" suggest director Guggenheim took Al Gores green message to heart.

"Gracie Winning Spirit washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Gracie Winning Spirit Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday June 1 2007 ""Gracie"" a heart-on-its-sleeve soccer fable subscribes to the notion that excellence is beyond no one. Anyone can be a marvelous soccer player -- or for that matter a virtuoso violinist chess master or astronaut -- as long as they have heart a photogenic face and the right music-driven training sequence. Set in 1978 the dark ages before Title IX the movie follows the dedication of 15-year-old Gracie (Carly Schroeder) to the legacy of her brother Johnny who dies in a car accident hours after a debilitating loss on the soccer field. Determined to get a spot on her brothers squad -- there are no girls teams at the school -- she contends with sexism at every turn. Even her father (Dermot Mulroney) who made it his obsessive business to coach Johnny is dismissive about her prospects. Directed by Davis Guggenheim (""An Inconvenient Truth"") the movie is heavy on hokum but easy to like thanks to the spunky Schroeder. ""Gracie"" is parenthetically appealing too for the real story that inspired it Actor Elisabeth Shue who plays Gracies mother was that same girl in real life a grieving sister who girded pads and cleats to honor a beloved departed brother. (To add to the between-the-lines poignancy shes also Guggenheims wife; see In Focus on Page 47.) The movie is little match for 2002s ""Bend It Like Beckham"" the wildly successful film that set hearts racing with its rich story about female empowerment on the soccer field as well as issues of family immigration and ethnicity. But ""Gracie"" will reach any audience happy to follow a young sprite who doesnt give up. -- Desson Thomson Gracie PG-13 92 minutes Contains brief sexual content. Area theaters.

Girls Perfected It."" With the recent examples of Bend It Like Beckham Shes the Man Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and the wonderful Iranian entry Offside one could make the same claim of soccer movies. Inspired by the real life of actress Elisabeth Shue who in 1978 fought to play boys varsity soccer at Columbia High in South Orange N.J. Gracie is a winner. It boasts the grit and determination of its heroine the only girl in a soccer-mad clan of boys a scattered teen who learns focus and follow-through by training as an athlete in the wake of a family tragedy. The film is something of a home movie. The actress brother Andrew wrote the story and costars; her husband Davis Guggenheim (Oscar-winning director of An Inconvenient Truth) directed; and Shue herself plays Gracies stoical mom. While it has many of the elements of the sports inspirational Gracie is different from the formula go-for-it movie. For starters Carly Schroeder who plays the title character combines ethereal beauty with elemental fire. Because of Schroeders performance I believed in Gracies teenage angst her free-floating anger at her parents and at life her frustration at being the odd girl out in a family of brothers. Like most teenagers Gracie is energy searching for an outlet. She doesnt find it in academic achievement. She doesnt find it in her encounters with boys. After much conflict and the kind of drama more typically seen in a movie like Thirteen than one like Invincible she finds an outlet in soccer. And her father (Dermot Mulroney in a quiet and unfussy performance) in training her finds connection with the child he had overlooked. Guggenheim doesnt bring much visual style to the game. But he brings heart (and some Bruce Springsteen on the soundtrack) to the story of a lost Jersey girl redeemed by sport. Yeah I cried. And cheered. You will too.

"Gracie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gracie ) Gracie (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Gracie is a by-the-numbers sports drama about a young girl who defies the odds to succeed in an all-male arena. Its the kind of thing that might make for a compelling after school special but is hardly what one expects to spend 10 for at a multiplex. The film hits all the expected high notes of melodrama does plenty of preaching from the pulpit and comes to a rather abrupt conclusion (immediately after the expected moment of redemption/triumph). Yet for all its faults Gracie is made with enough grace to get us rooting for the protagonist. This is due more to the heartfelt performance of actress Carly Schroeder than it is the less-than-inspired inspirational screenplay by Lisa Marie Petersen and Karen Janszen. Supposedly based on events from the life of Elisabeth Shue (keep in mind how Hollywood usually twists these based-on-real-life tales) Gracie takes us to South Orange New Jersey in 1978. The sense of time and place arent strong but thats not a big deal. Gracie (Carly Schoeder) is the younger sister of high school soccer star Johnny (Jesse Lee Soffer) the pride and joy of his dad Bryan (Dermot Mulroney). Johnny and Gracie share a special bond that is severed one tragic night when he is killed in car crash. His death devastates the entire family but Bryan and Gracie are the most deeply impacted. Gracie decides that to honor Johnnys memory she will try out for the all-boys soccer team but she faces obstacles on all sides. Her mother Lindsay (Elisabeth Shue) doesnt want her to get hurt. Bryan is unwilling to coach her. The school believes she has no right to infringe upon an all-boys sport. And on top of everything shes not particularly good. Like most sports stories this is all about the underdog fighting for her dream and proving herself. The first half is better than the second. For a while as we get to know Gracie and understand what motivates her theres a sense of discovery. Unfortunately the movie eventually falls in line with the formula and it becomes easy to predict not only where the story will end up but all the intermediate rest-stops where it will pause on the way to the final destination. Gracie offers all the requisite big emotional moments yet none are as rousing as they should be. Too often things that occur in this film feel obligatory or are pushed across with little subtlety such as the anti-discrimination message. Things were a little different in 1978 especially when it came to high school athletics. Girls were expected to play girls sports and boys were expected to play boys sports and never the twain should meet. While Gracies story might not be true there were girls in the late 70s and early 80s who challenged the status quo resulting in extracurricular circumstances developing the diversity they exhibit today. One has to wonder however whether this story is sufficiently interesting for todays audiences especially considering its fictional nature. Carly Schroeder hitherto known primarily for a recurring role on TVs Lizzie McGuire (she was also in Mean Creek where she first caught my attention) shows that given the spotlight she possesses the intensity to hold it. She invests Gracie with heart beauty and determination. Schroeder took this role seriously training to make the experience real for the character and it works. No one threatens to steal scenes from Schroeder. Dermot Mulroney and Elisabeth Shue as Gracies parents give low-key performances. Christopher Shand as the over-the-top and oily Kyle belongs in the category of actors who dont understand that sometimes menace can be better conveyed through restraint. Gracie is painless enough and at times even enjoyable. But it suffers from an overriding feeling that this would be better positioned as a made-for-TV feature. Director Davis Guggenheim (Shues husband) is riding high in the wake of standing behind the cameras to film Al Gore for An Inconvenient Truth. Gracie is an odd follow-up; theres nothing distinctive or distinguishing about the material. Its what one might reasonably expect from someone trying to break into Hollywood. Guggenheim isnt a filmmaker-for-hire on this project. This is a story he wants to tell. Sadly its not told well enough to make it worth a trip to a multiplex. Schroeder scores; the movie doesnt.

This amiable rouser based on the experiences of Elisabeth Shue and her family (Shue was one of the producers) tries to convey how gutsy and role-smashing it is for Heather Graham-cute Gracie (Carly Schroeder) to cleat her way onto an all-boys soccer team. So why is Gracie as processed as an after-school special? You miss the knockabout edge of Bend It Like Beckham -- though the ending in its Pavlovian sports-flick way pumps you up.
