"Foxx and Co. Play by the Rules -- and Lose - washingtonpost.com washingtonpost.com  gt; Print Edition  gt; Weekend Print This ArticleE-Mail This Article i>>? Foxx and Co. Play by the Rules -- and Lose By Michael OSullivanWashington Post Staff Writer Friday May 14 2004; Page H01 CONTRARY to its name ""Breakin All the Rules"" violates no regulations -- at least not according to the Revised Code of Romantic Comedies (Sophomoric Subgroup). Theres even a flatulent incontinent alcoholic dog which I believe is a requirement of the genre these days. Ironically though the movies respect for authority -- or at least convention -- is its undoing.But before we go any further I just want to say this No movie this stupid should need a plot synopsis this complicated. Lets have a go at it anyway. Save amp; Share ArticleWhats This?DiggGoogledel.icio.usYahooRedditFacebook Jamie Foxx plays Quincy a magazine editor who gets dragooned by his boss Philip (Peter MacNicol) into firing his co-workers. Smarting from the clumsy way he himself has just been dumped by his girlfriend Helen (Bianca Lawson) Quincy decides to use his sudden expertise in the field of public humiliation to write a how-to book on breaking up. It becomes a hit.Meanwhile Quincys playa cousin Evan (Morris Chestnut) fearing that his girl Nicky (Gabrielle Union) is about to kick him to the curb first enlists Quincy to assist him in deep-sixing her. At the same time Philip seeks Quincys aid in getting rid of his gold-digging squeeze Rita (Jennifer Esposito). Rita getting wind of this and mistaking Evan for Quincy embarks on an affair with Evan to make Philip jealous. Other instances of mistaken identity and unintended romantic entanglements occur (e.g. between Quincy and Nicky) along with a running gag involving a wizened old man uttering the phrase ""Hold my [bad word for private body part].""See? Its just like Shakespeares ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"" or maybe a frothy French farce by the playwright Feydeau only as written by the Farrelly brothers.Dont get me wrong -- its not all gutter humor. There are even a few ideas floating around in the script by director Daniel Taplitz such as the notion that love is a kind of insanity involving both narcissism and masochism. ""Women"" observes Rita a conniver who winds up getting connived ""dont fall in love with men they can manipulate.""This is the kind of deep thinking youd expect from a movie that is missing a ""g"" from the title.Worst of all though is the fact that Foxx seems to have been sedated in preparation for this role. Hes the best -- not to mention the most unpredictable -- thing about ""Rules"" and the last thing you want to do with a comedian like that is to turn him into a law-abiding citizen. BREAKIN ALL THE RULES (PG-13 85 minutes) -- Contains obscenity and sexual and bathroom humor. Area theaters.

"Breakin All the Rules Foul on The Play washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Breakin All the Rules Foul on The Play Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 14 2004 Jamie Foxx stars as a best-selling self-help author in ""Breakin All the Rules"" a mid-season forgettable that with any luck will disappear quickly. As Quincy a magazine editor who turns a painful breakup into a million-dollar advice book on how to leave your lover properly (one example the passive-aggressive bullet straight to the head) Foxx displays none of the talent he did in say ""Any Given Sunday"" or the ""In Living Color"" series. This is not entirely his fault. Written by Daniel Taplitz ""Breakin All the Rules"" has the frantic jumbled quality of so many formulaic first-time efforts (Taplitz also makes his directorial debut here and a sorry one it is). It also sounds as if it were recorded in a high school bathroom. Between a volume level that seems to be permanently set at 11 the unintelligible dialogue and the clanging echoes behind every indoor scene its impossible to know whether whats being said is funny. Instead viewers must rely on lame sight gags such as an incontinent pug a randy old man and some painfully forced physical slapstick to indicate that a joke is in process. Its too bad because at least on the basis of casting ""Breakin All the Rules"" had the potential to be a minor classic on a par with ""Love Jones"" or ""Brown Sugar."" Those films might have possessed modest artistic merit but they made valuable contributions to the rare genre of the romantic comedy geared toward young professional African Americans. Here Foxx shares the screen with such promising talents as Morris Chestnut (who plays Quincys game-playing cousin Evan) and Gabrielle Union; both are surpassingly attractive actors whose warmth and intelligence suggest theyre much better than the material theyve been given to work with. Jennifer Esposito and Peter MacNicol -- resembling a cross between Jack Benny and the Watergate-era John Dean -- round out the cast in a film that aspires to the round-robin sexual farce of the great 1930s screwball comedies but that instead just goes round and round to an utterly predictable end. MacNicol as Quincys hapless boss gets some comic licks in especially in a ludicrous fight scene near the end. But thats a rare moment of levity in a movie that sags and drags under the weight of poor pacing execrable writing and largely unlikable characters including a leading man viewers can never really warm up to. And as even the most iconoclastic filmmaker will tell you in Hollywood that last rule is one that can never be broken. Breakin All the Rules (85 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual material/humor and language.

Although hardly as wild and freewheeling as its title promises ""Breakin All the Rules"" manages to amuse as a cleverly concocted hybrid of conventional romantic comedy and mistaken-identity farce. Despite the abundance of bigger-hyped product in current theatrical release pic should score with its target demographic -- African-American urban auds -- and could expand its appeal with favorable critical response and strong word of mouth. Crossover potential likely will fuel solid ancillary biz. Credit writer-helmer Daniel Taplitz (""Commandments"") for achieving a degree of Feydeau-like complexity in a scenario rife with misread signals rash assumptions self-defensive feints and self-serving deceits. L.A. magazine exec Quincy Watson (Jamie Foxx) is devastated when hes abruptly dumped by Helen (Bianca Lawson) his flighty fiancee. His blue mood turns darker when his boss timorous Phillip Gascon (Peter MacNicol) fearing employee retribution assigns him the messy task of laying off 15% of the magazine staff. Quincy opts to quit rather than serve as hatchet man. But he takes his ""employee termination"" research adds that to his first-hand knowledge of romantic rejection -- and scribbles an angry screed that evolves into a bestselling ""Breakup Handbook"" filled with practical pointers for anyone who wants to avoid unpleasant scenes or homicidal attacks while severing ties. Phillip -- who publishes the book under his magazines imprimatur -- seeks private breakup lessons from Quincy so he can rid himself of Rita (Jennifer Esposito) a leggy gold-digger. Evan (Morris Chestnut) Phillips commitment-averse cousin also requests help when he mistakenly deduces that Nicky (Gabriel Union) his current girlfriend is about to dump him. Complications begin when Quincy meets Nicky in a fashionable lounge and without knowing who she is falls for her. Nicky however knows who Quincy is -- and more important what he has written -- but gives him a fake name so she can divine his motives. Rita meanwhile learns Quincy is giving breakup advice to Phillip and vows to win the author over to her side. When she arrives at Quincys house however she mistakes Evan for Quincy. Inconvenient events and overheard telephone messages are just a few of the contrivances employed by Taplitz as he keeps pic moving at a pleasingly brisk clip. The humor isnt always sophisticated -- an incontinent dog also figures into the mix- but the dialogue is genuinely witty more often than not and the well-cast lead players hit all the right notes. Foxx breezes through with a winning combo of frisky playfulness and comic consternation. Union once again evidences (as in ""Deliver Us From Eva"") impressive range and star presence as she comes off smart and sexy feisty and vulnerable. Chestnut is a smooth operator in a role that requires him to serve mostly as straight man. MacNicol and Lawson take the broader-is-funnier approach but they stop well short of outright cartoonishness. Esposito is at her best in a scene where her character reveals surprising self-awareness in regard to her diminishing shelf-life as a sexy siren. Heather Headley is such a sensational performer in brief concert sequence that auds may wish pic would place plot on pause long enough for her to finish her torchy rendition of ""He Is."" Except for a few interior scenes that appear unaccountably dark tech values are first-rate.

How about Jamie Foxxs new comedy Breakin All the Rules Jim Jarmuschs new caffeine-and-cancer-stick flick Coffee and Cigarettes or Lili Taylor in A Slipping Down Life? Rza and Bill Murray look well dumbsquizzed in Coffee and Cigarettes. United Artists Breakin All the Rules  1/2 yet another mistaken-identity romantic comedy and if you laid all of those since the 1930s end to end you wouldnt be able to afford the journey at todays gasoline prices. This one works better than some because the lead is the funny Jamie Foxx sporting a haircut that makes him look like a victim of The Green Miles gone-crazy electric chair. After Foxxs character writes a best seller about how to break off relationships he meets a woman (Gabrielle Union) for whom hair is a major concern. Union who has risked a severe trim to look more like Halle Berry thinks the result is awful. Foxx doesnt realize that Union is cousin Morris Chestnuts girlfriend who was advertised as having long hair. There also is another identity mix-up this one involving Chestnut a gold-digger (Jennifer Esposito) and a publisher who has the gold (Peter MacNicol). If the movie were 10 minutes longer the mix-ups might grind viewers down but director Daniel Taplitz knows how to juggle the subplots hes given. Designed to be a date movie Rules could have stronger male appeal than many comedies of its ilk. (Rated PG-13 sexual material/humor and language) --Mike Clark Coffee and Cigarettes 1/2 Coffee and Cigarettes would be a self-indulgent exercise if it were not so free of ambition. But this series of 5- to 10-minute vignettes linked thematically by people swigging coffee and smoking cigarettes is too slight and pointless. (Related video Watch a clip from Coffee and Cigarettes) The project began 18 years ago when director Jim Jarmusch was asked to create a small film for Saturday Night Live. That Dadaist short starring Roberto Benigni and Stephen Wright kicks off the movie and may be the weakest link among the vaguely interconnected parts. The next installments were made in 1989 1993 and last year. There was not much improvement over the years. These shorts starring such talents as Cate Blanchett Bill Murray and Steve Buscemi feel so haphazardly conceived and slapped together that one wonders for whom this compilation was made. (In select cities. Rated R for language.) -- Claudia Puig A Slipping Down Life 1/2 A Slipping Down Life was made five years ago and has been sitting on a studios shelf ever since. Those involved with it -- and those who see it -- might wish it had slipped down behind a shelf and gotten permanently lodged. This adaptation of one of Anne Tylers lesser novels is a sluggish tedious film about lost souls living dead-end lives in a dead-end town. Their actions often defy rationality. Lili Taylor plays Evie a painfully shy woman who hates her job as an amusement park worker in a giant rabbits costume so intensely that she sometimes heads straight for oncoming headlights while driving home. One of the few things that perk her up is a nightly radio program on which she hears the seductive voice of a local musician played by Guy Pearce. Hes a sexy rocker inexplicably named Drumstrings Casey a singer with the habit of interrupting his songs mid-stream with pseudo-philosophizing. The only person who seems to get his stream-of-consciousness ramblings is Evie and she finds them so inspiring that she carves his name on her forehead with broken glass. In the real world this act would likely result in psychiatric intervention but in the movies alternate universe she becomes a mini-celebrity and a source of publicity for Caseys struggling band. Tyler has always been fairly adept at creating oddball characters who are both poignant and amusing. But neither of those elements comes through in first-time director Toni Kalems screenplay or in Taylors inert performance. (In New York and Los Angeles.

Starring Jamie Foxx Gabrielle Union Morris Chestnut. Directed and written by Daniel Taplitz. (PG-13. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Quincy the character played by Jamie Foxx in ""Breakin All the Rules"" writes a best-seller about how to dissolve a romantic relationship. Among the books nuggets is the recommendation that the breakup happen in a public place so nobody causes a scene. Its the kind of stuff Lewis and Clark must have bantered about on the trail but forgot to write down. The freshest thing about ""Breakin All the Rules"" is its dropped ""g."" Writer and director Daniel Taplitz piles on the convolutions in an overripe comedy of sitcom stock characters and bad jokes. The films humor can be summed up in a running gag about a dog getting drunk. You cant blame Foxx for wanting a starring role but hes too good for this picture. Not just because hes been in marquee films like ""Any Given Sunday"" and ""Ali"" but also because hes better than everyone else here. He is the antithesis of his cocksure ""Any Given Sunday"" character here as a mild- mannered magazine editor jarred by his girlfriends indelicate breakup and the loss of his job. Foxx makes a wonderful sad sack letting his face go slack in a way that must be hard to do at will. ""Breakin All the Rules"" contains the requisite scene of post-traumatic dishevelment. You know the setup dejected dirty guy food cartons littering the house. In a womans robe and a weeks worth of beard Foxx makes the scene work well. He looks slightly crazed as Quincy reveals the pages of his breakup manifesto to his cousin (Morris Chestnut). Theres a right and wrong way to break up he tells the cousin and he wants to set people straight. The various overlapping hookups and breakups involve the cousin posing as Quincy the cousin and Quincy dating the same woman (Gabrielle Union from ""Bring It On"") and other characters influenced by the tips in Quincys book including a gold digger (Jennifer Esposito) too obvious for a C-grade noir. And the dog keeps begging for the bottle. Foxx has little chemistry with either Union or Chestnut partly because his offbeat handsomeness -- almond eyes slight overbite -- is more compelling than his co-stars more conventional good looks. But its mostly because hes more engaged. Foxx had to know about the drunk-dog jokes in the script but he gave his best anyway. That counts for something. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations innuendo raw language.

"Tart and affectionate banter holds Breakin together - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Tart and affectionate banter holds Breakin together By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  May 14 2004 The title is disposably generic the plot has moth holes and the cinematography is the scuzziest Ive ever seen in a film that wasnt shot using the directors fathers video camera. But ""Breakin All the Rules"" has something many movies dont these days interesting and attractive people talking to each other.Maybe that isnt much but you take what you can get. The story line is a retooled Rock Hudson/Doris Day confection but with a lot less huffing and puffing about it than last years ""Down With Love."" The gimmick is that all the flirtatious double talk and mistaken identities have been airlifted into Buppie-land that tension-free movie universe in which upscale African-Americans meet mate and crack wise while dressing and living in a state of casual swank. Theres nothing remotely ""street real"" about ""Breakin All the Rules"" and thats one of its small pleasures.The film gets the requisite dog-pee joke out of the way before the opening credits and then heads uptown. Quincy Watson (Jamie Foxx) is an editor at LA-based Spoil magazine who gets dumped by his self-absorbed girlfriend (Bianca Lawson) and in revenge writes a hit book on how to break up with your significant other without creating a stalker. ""Falling in love is blissful insanity"" Quincy says ""but breaking up is a rational act."" His rise to the top of the bestseller list appears to take about three days; believability is not the movies strong suit.Its strong suit instead is the tart affectionate back-and-forth banter written by director Daniel Taplitz (""Commandments"") and laid down by a likable cast playing it just broadly enough. Quincys cousin Evan (Morris Chestnut) is a ladies man hoping to ditch his new girlfriend Nicky (Gabrielle Union); he enlists Quincy as a conspirator but when the latter meets Nicky at a bar for the first time she is unrecognizable in a haircut that makes her look ""like Halle Berrys Yorkshire terrier."" He falls for her not knowing who she is; she falls for him knowing just enough to know its a bad idea.Meanwhile Quincys boss a media mogul played with droll white-guy constipation by Peter MacNicol needs his hit authors advice on how to break up with marriage-hungry shark Rita (Jennifer Esposito). Striking back Rita mistakes Evan for Quincy and tries to negotiate a deal using sexual favors. Best known for his turn in ""Ally McBeal"" MacNicol is basically playing the old Tony Randall role here; he dithers and stutters and has a lot of fun with the part passing most of that enjoyment on to the audience.What sounds like playa misogyny on paper is defanged onscreen by the sweet foolishness of the male characters and by the fact that ""Breakin All the Rules"" simply stops and holds its breath whenever Union shows up. As Nicky shes lovely in a girl-next-door way and equally smart tough and vulnerable; the dialogue scenes between her and Foxx have charm and more important heat -- the kind that comes from a meeting of like sensibilities. Halfway through Taplitz lets the two play a game of 20 questions that dismantles all the lies theyve told each other up to then; its as though their attraction were strong enough to melt the conventions of the dinky romantic comedy theyre in.I dont want to oversell the movie. The second half caves in to strained farce and cheap yuks and the film really does look like it was shot through a burlap sack. As date-night piffle goes though its thoroughly engaging. If ""Breakin All the Rules"" will be gone from the cultural memory banks within six weeks it keeps you smiling for the 85 minutes its on the screen.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Breakin All the Rules D. Stevens) C+ Breakin All The Rules Genre Romance Comedy; Starring Jennifer Esposito Jamie Foxx Morris Chestnut Gerald Emerick Gabrielle Union; Director Daniel Taplitz; Author Daniel Taplitz; Release Date Wide 05/14/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 85; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted May 12 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT Jamie Foxx is fast funny and a rather scary-looking dude. With his big-toothed grin demonic flared eyeballs and sculpted explosion of mini-dreads he could be a cross between Matt Damon and Cesar Romeros Joker. Hes got the appearance of a born anarchist so its a surprise to see what an appealing romantic-comedy star he makes in Breakin All the Rules. As Quincy who writes a self-help best-seller on how to break up with your significant other Foxx isnt playing a love-em-and-leave-em dog. Hes an ardent monogamist who got dumped by his fiancee and is now on the prowl - very very tentatively. As long as Foxx is discoursing on such breakup techniques as ""the passive-aggressive bullet straight to the head"" he rules the screen with his peppy ferocity. Then Quincy meets Nicky (Gabrielle Union) whos gotten a haircut that allows everyone in the movie to compare her to Halle Berry. Wouldnt it have been fine if she just looked like herself? The sparks fly but ""Breakin All the Rules"" insists on an overload of twists and obstacles which means that Evan (Morris Chestnut) Nickys boyfriend and Quincys cousin has to pine for her only because he thinks shes dumping him. Which she isnt. But she should be. Get the picture? The rules of good screenwriting are mostly broken though Jamie Foxxs smash-and-grab charisma remains intact.
