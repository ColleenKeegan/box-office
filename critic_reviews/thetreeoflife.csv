(AP Photo/Fox Searchlight Merie Wallace) From left Laramie Eppler Jessica Chastain and Hunter McCracken star in ""The Tree of Life."" (AP Photo/Fox Searchlight Merie Wallace) ""The Tree of Life"" is a religious experience. Overtly. Audaciously. Unashamedly. No film has ever reached as high toward the face of God and in our commodified future few are likely to try. If like Icarus Terrence Malick gets burned because of it this singular film will survive as a testament to an artists aspirations.Malick maintained a discreet dialogue with God in the wheat fields of ""Days of Heaven"" and the battlefields of ""The Thin Red Line."" But here the seeking of divine grace is plainly spoken as spirits are summoned to the mortal plane absorb the glory of creation and return to the light from whence they came.The young spirit whose passing stirs the bare wisp of a narrative is the middle child in a family of three sons. They are raised in Waco Texas in the mid-50s by a mother (Jessica Chastain) who embodies selfless love and a father (Brad Pitt) who believes in the competitive design of the natural order. When the son dies unexpectedly at age 19 the mothers faith is shaken and the doubt reverberates for decades with her oldest son Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn). On the anniversary of his brothers death Dallas developer Jack is haunted by regrets.Then in bold defiance of filmmaking orthodoxy Malick traces Jacks life to its origins in the cosmic cauldron of volcanic soup and cellular mutations. He dares to introduce dinosaurs into the story in seamlessly realized footage that is worthy of a science museum and which documents a prehistoric instance of compassion.Compassion and gratitude are the messages that the mother transmits to her newborn son even as the father steers him in a survivalist direction. The middle section of the film in which Jack is molded like holy clay is simply the most beautifully sustained achievement in the history of the medium. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki gives us prismatic Proustian images from a childs perspective breezes through a curtain branches backlit by shafts of sunlight an aged face looking down into a cradle and promising ""Well see you in five years."" But Jacks expelled from Eden with the arrival of two brothers the imposition of rules and the fluttering of sexual desire that turns to Oedipal rage toward the ruler of the household.As the father Pitt is both stern and sympathetic a man of his era who jettisons his parental tenderness and musical talents to succeed in an aeronautics career. As the adolescent son Hunter McCracken is equally complex. Chastains character is more idealized with direct comparisons to Sleeping Beauty and a levitating angel. Her spirit suffuses the movie which is even more monolithically high-minded (and humorless) than the film to which it begs comparisons ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" ""The Tree of Life"" is rooted in human nature but ascends to the infinite mystery. Its a dizzying climb with few footholds for the timid or cynical but the view from above is heavenly.""The Tree of Life""Four stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 218  Content Mature themes and some violence  Where The Tivoli Videos Watch a trailer for The Tree of Life Jun 9 2011 (...)

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 10 2011 600AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 11 2013 248PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Since Terrence Malick makes films only slightly more often than God makes pronouncements The Tree of Life - his fifth offering in 38 years - has excited much anticipation. Now the wait is over and by all thats holy the result actually plays like a divine pronouncement cosmic in scope and oracular in tone a cinematic sermon on the mount that shows its creator in exquisite form. Movies The Tree of Life The official trailer Exquisite but frustrating. As deities go Malick is par for the course - he too can beguile us and irk us he too commands our respect yet not always our love.Indeed love and cruelty are the double helix that weaves through every frame of the picture starting with an opening quote from Job whose patience is being tried by his unfathomable Maker. Ours will be tested also but contrary to some early reports this isnt an unfathomable or even unduly complex movie. Quite the contrary. From the title on down the meaning is clear and the narrative is quite literal in its linearity. Malick takes us on a journey from the very birth of the universe to its current flawed state with a stopover to a family in small-town Texas circa the 1950s. Sure thats quite the excursion yet you dont need a compass to chart the direction - it may not be simple but its definitely straightforward.The trip is prefaced by a claim delivered in voice-over (Malicks preferred mode of address) that there are only two routes through life ""the way of nature and the way of grace."" Grace is abundant in the storys mother figure the pious and loving Mrs. OBrien (Jessica Chastain) wife of Mr. OBrien (Brad Pitt) and a sufferer of that most awful of tragedies - the death of a child her middle son in his late teens. How he died we never learn but the rest of the film can be seen as a reaction to his cruelly shortened life and to the question it inevitably poses Why? Why such a brief candle?Thats when Malick retreats from death to birth all the way back to the origins of the cosmos conveyed in a very long and visually stunning sequence that traces the ""way of nature"" - celestial stirrings the big bang galactic formations starry constellations planetary eruptions a single-cell organism a jelly fish a predatory shark and almost risibly a small dinosaur getting stomped on by a large dinosaur carving out its territorial imperative. With its requiem score the sequence unfolds like a gorgeous episode of Nova as beauty and violence perpetually co-mingle. Its sweeping enough to make that previous origins film The New World look stunted. Its also at times portentously tedious.Then comes the Texas stopover where the macro gives way to the micro and to a further montage - the birth of Mrs. OBriens first son Jack the baptism babys first steps two other boys born their seemingly idyllic childhood of mothers milk and the great outdoors and fresh breeze through gossamer curtains. However the theme of a disappearing Eden permeates all of Malicks work and this is no exception. Enter the serpent in the shape of the father another creative lord and destructive master.What follows is a gripping evocative and searingly honest rendition of My Three Sons - Malick at his accessible best. Red-haired patient long-suffering and virtually silent Chastain is the embodiment of absolute love but its Pitt who injects the picture with a much-needed infusion of danger ambiguity and yes old-fashioned drama. With his hair cropped and his torso stuffed into a succession of short-sleeve dress shirts Daddy is a man disappointed a frustrated musician obliged to toil as a middle manager in the local refinery. To his children this father too is simultaneously loving and cruel issuing soft kisses and bullying commands his bouts of tenderness alternating with explosions of temper - human natures big bang.Young Jack (Hunter McCracken) navigates between his parents and the ""two ways"" they obviously represent. He experiences a sexual awakening flirts with an Oedipal complex and eventually as an adult can be found in a place that Malick has never visited in any of his earlier works the present day. The director seems uncomfortable there and (portrayed in a cameo by Sean Penn) so does Jack. Hes an architect now still troubled by his brothers death and trapped in an urban prison of steel and glass. Escape beckons in the surreal guise of the films climax when what began as a cosmic bang ends with the human whimper of wishful thinking - a kind of Rapture scene where even the portal to heaven looks grey and sombre.But maybe thats the point. Our conclusion individually or as a species is bound to be an anti-climax. With or without us the journey continues and ultimately nothing will outlast that ever-hovering question. In The Tree of Life only the ""Why?"" is eternal.The Tree of LifeDirected and written by Terrence MalickStarring Brad Pitt Jessica Chastain Hunter McCrackenClassification PG Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts More Related to this Story Tree of Life Take Shelter lead Toronto film critics awards The best of Malicks rest playing at TIFF Cinematheque in Toronto Win calms The Tree of Lifes box office jitters Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post A motion picture-poem is not the sort of thing we expect at the start of the summer movie season. Yet here it is a demanding and astonishing gift. Demanding ""Its like the home movies of an art-house director"" said one guest to a publicist on the way out of the preview of writer-director Terrence Malicks portrait of a family ""The Tree of Life."" That local screening took place a few days before the film which stars Brad Pitt and Sean Penn won the top honor at the Cannes Film Festival in May. And the Palme dOr is just the prize to act as an exclamation point to a quickie assessment See how rarefied indulgent a work Malick has made? The French like it. And yet astonishing What a transcendent achievement of American complexity Malick a denizen of Oklahoma and Texas has sculpted. ""The Tree of Life"" is an intimate and willfully cosmic rendering of one family that unfolds as a requiem a tone poem as anything but a traditional narrative feature. Its as if the terrain of Malicks youth has breathed the silence and symphony of plains and woods into his art. This isnt the first time this rootedness has found its way on-screen; its been a current in the directors work running from ""Badlands"" to ""Days of Heaven"" from ""The Thin Red Line"" to ""The New World."" And Malicks heady education -- Harvard Oxford as a Rhodes scholar in philosophy and then the American Film Institute Conservatory -- likely fed him the big ideas to match and nudge the vast lessons of his childhoods literal geography. Home movie? If only. Pitt stars as Mr. OBrien one of those complicated fathers the 1950s wrought. Penn portrays the adult son molded by a stern paternal love and a more consistent and generous maternal affection. The action is set for the most part in Austin Texas where Mr. OBrien Mrs. OBrien and their three boys live. The child roles of Jack R.L. and Steve are played with zest and sensitivity by nonactors Hunter McCracken Laramie Eppler and Tye Sheridan. Scenes of the grown-up architect Jack take place amid the concrete steel and glass of Houston. Jessica Chastain is Mrs. OBrien. While new to big-screen audiences the Juilliard-trained actor wont be for long. Shell soon appear in the adaptation of Kathryn Stocketts ""The Help"" and ""The Debt"" an espionage thriller. Chastains rich voice seldom emanates from her visage. More often she speaks as a narrator with observations that sound like prayers. Penn does much of his work in silence too. And the ways in which voice is used throughout ""The Tree of Life"" suggest a newfangled silent movie full of sounds disjointed narrations and stunning images. ""No one who loves the ways of grace comes to a bad end"" Mrs. OBrien says. Then she adds ""It will be there for you whatever comes."" And come it does. Theres a reason Malick begins his film with a verse from Job. The work is cryptic stingy with puzzle-solving details. But there is anguish grief. Mrs. OBrien wails and paces down a tree-lined street. Mr. OBrien bends over involuntarily on a tarmac. A grandmother offers words of comfort that never do the job. A child is gone. And Jack the man reckons and remembers. Flashbacks abound. They fracture the story and piece together a shared existence. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki relies on hand-held camerawork. It gets at the intimacy within a family a household. But it is also remarkably fluid capturing the flow of existence -- this familys our universes. Malick also called on visual-effects whiz Douglas Trumbull (""2001 A Space Odyssey"") to create the movies images of lifes cosmic sweep. They are humbling the stuff of science of the Hubble telescope of our elemental past and beyond. Composer and conductor Alexandre Desplats choices -- sacred celestial -- are equally exquisite. Among the many indelible images is one that remains Young boys rush joyfully into a summer plume that exudes from a truck trundling down a tree-lined street. On the side of the truck the letters read ""DDT."" ""The Tree of Life"" is about what we know and do not what we fear and do not. As children. As adults. As men. As women (though maybe not as much). As fathers and mothers. As humans. ""the tree of life"" PG-13 for some thematic material. 2 hours 18 minutes.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 Its practically a miracle that Terrence Malick keeps making movies. More about The Tree of Life >> Since Badlands his 1974 debut the press-shy writer-director has worked with purpose and poetry way off Hollywoods beaten path. His reliance on voice-over narration his use of light and image - rapturous shots of animals and fields people framed beneath wide arching skies - and a sense of a world spinning into eternity where the actors strike their poses dressed as outlaws or farmers soldiers or explorers without having much to say. . . . This is the last man Universals going to call to make Fast and Furious 15. There are other American filmmakers who have managed to go their own way Woody Allen for one whose prolific output makes him the proverbial hare to Malicks tortoise. But Allen mostly serves up diversions amusements. Theres nothing wrong with Midnight in Paris - its charming with a clever conceit - but its not going to change your life. The Tree of Life Malicks fifth and most ambitious undertaking not only aspires to change your life - it tries to explain it from the first cosmic blip to those busy amoebae splitting and multiplying to jellyfish jellying through the primal seas to the planets lined up in a row. And did we say Brad Pitt and Sean Penn star in this thing? Set in 1950s Texas - when its not jumping back to Jurassic riverbeds or whooshing through the cosmos - The Tree of Life follows a simple and handsome American family as they do simple and handsome things. Pitt is the father working as a manager at a big plant. His fierce temper and aching restlessness can get the better of him delivering the worst on his wife (Jessica Chastain who could have been Andrew Wyeths muse if she had time-traveled down the Brandywine) and three boys. Their lives go by like a Flickr slideshow balloon-tire bikes wheeling down shaded side streets a baseball bat whacking at a ball a toddler wobbling his first steps the billowing curtains and neat bedspreads sun rays and shadow playing like ghosts on a wall. Pitt is the provider the hunter-gatherer only its the era of Ike and big cars TVs and DDT (theres a haunting shot of neighborhood kids all innocence and play losing themselves in the fog of a City of Waco truck as it rolls down the street spraying insecticide). His nature is Mans his wifes is grace. Chastains character has less to say than even Pitts who lets loose with the occasional dinner-table lecture. She is there to embody motherhood and beauty floating (in one scene literally) above the woes and worries of the world. And woes and worry befall this family money problems job problems a jarring death. Cut to present day and the glass skyscrapers of a city where Jack (a brooding crosshatched Penn) one of Pitt and Chastains three Texas sons now works as an architect contemplating his existence. He looks like he wants to turn it all in for something else and looks through the floor-to-ceiling panes with a pained expression somewhere between sorrow and regret. And look is the operative verb If Penn has more than a dozen words in The Tree of Life I missed them. (Theres an amusing Qamp;A with Christopher Plummer hired by Malick for The New World in this weeks New York magazine. Plummer gripes about Malicks penchant for cutting his actors out of his movies. Adrien Brody completely gone from The Thin Red Line Plummer hardly in The New World. Malick says the actor is ""fascinated by nature and just cuts to birds."") Still somehow The Tree of Life - impressionistic revelatory elliptical - works. The moons of Jupiter a butterfly cupped in a hand a dog scampering down the sidewalk kids breaking a window the seven white buttons going up the neckline of Chastains dress - everything aligns. The scenes with the dinosaurs (yes dinosaurs) are goofy sure but have you ever cared so much about the emotional life of a raptor before? And when a whole parade of people living and dead forgotten and remembered crisscross along a beach as The Tree of Life reaches its cosmic coda well its more like a new-agey commercial for life insurance than a meditation on the eternal soul. But somewhere back there in this amazing cinematic opus Chastains matriarchetype has this to say ""Unless you love your life will flash by."" Which is kind of transcendent and kind of Zen and kind of corny - and definitely something to think about. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The Tree of Life Good Director Terrence Malick. Cast Brad Pitt Jessica Chastain Sean Penn. Rating PG-13 for some thematic material. Note At Harkins Camelview 5. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Brad Pitt His output is hardly prodigious. ""The Tree of Life"" is his fifth feature film in 38 years. But for those willing to dive into its mysteries this is a film well worth the wait. Beautiful baffling poetic pretentious its one big ball of moviedom. Malick tackles the whole shooting match pondering (and showing) the creation of the universe life itself death and the afterlife and everything in between. Interview Jessica Chastain Tree one branch in a busy year Granted thats a tall order getting to the bottom of all that; balancing it with the life of a family in small-town Texas in the 1950s increases the degree of difficulty. He isnt entirely successful but thats OK. When you leave the theater you wont just have been entertained youll have been engaged and how great a gift in modern film is that? Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain play Mr. and Mrs. OBrien a couple raising three boys in a seemingly idyllic Texas town. The lights the shadows the look and feel are perfect. There is depth to the images a beauty thats almost tactile. The boys run and play outside all day. Doors are open. Dares are made and accepted. Dinners are eaten with chairs pulled up to the table and manners strictly adhered to an indication that things may not be as wonderful as initially depicted. Theres a whiff of failure about Mr. OBrien who works in a factory and plays the organ at church; he also plays classical records during dinner. Hes a stern disciplinarian putting up with no hint of back talk no deviation from his version of how life should work for his family. Any such disturbance is met with angry sometimes frightening reaction. This is especially challenging for Jack (Hunter McCracken) his oldest son not yet a teenager. They thrive under the almost-ethereal presence of their mother and while they love their father they fear him and his oppressive domineering manner. As Malick moves backward and forth in time an older Mrs. OBrien receives devastating news. Moving forward again Jack (Sean Penn) the oldest OBrien boy now grown mopes about (hes not asked to do much else). The suggestion is that the tragedy haunts him still although its not explicitly stated. Not long after comes Malicks biggest gamble the creation of the universe. Not as a metaphorical detail illustrated by some event in the familys life but the literal creation complete with planets and dinosaurs and more culminating in the birth of a boy Jack. Its cinematically risky but I found it stunning. Others will find it absurd. Malick one senses doesnt really care. He tells his stories in his own way oblivious to external reaction. (Of course hes a recluse so this is just a guess.) Whatever your feeling Malick doesnt duck the big questions. Its an all-or-nothing sequence. Back in Texas the young Jack struggles more and more with his fathers growing dissatisfaction with his life and the effect that dissatisfaction is having on his family. Moving again to the adult Jack we see that theres more to his unhappiness than just the earlier tragedy but also his own loss of youth of innocence. Malick isnt done though maybe he should have been. He has taken us this far and he takes us farther to an afterlife that is not as convincing as the creation scenes not as moving as Jacks childhood. Yet again theres no shying away from the big - the biggest - picture. Pitt and Chastain are outstanding. Pitt expertly balances affection and anger in realistic terms. Mr. OBrien genuinely loves his family but his pent-up frustrations must find an outlet. Chastain meanwhile comes off almost like an ideal of motherhood rather than a genuine character. Thats not a criticism; Malick is working in broad strokes here. Best of all is McCracken as the young Jack. He is angry hurt respectful fearful defiant. But mostly hes confused and McCracken gets that across with a wonderful performance. ""The Tree of Life"" wont be for everyone. Some will find it maddening others beautiful. Its well worth seeing to learn on which side of the divide youll find yourself. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Tree of Life The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tree-of-life-the ) Tree of Life The (United States 2011) June 09 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli At its least Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life is an ambitious slice of cinema by a major filmmaker. Striving for no less than the pinnacle of Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey The Tree of Life falls short of masterful but retains a power that far too many motion pictures lack. Its about something and even when it fails it does so in a manner that is interesting and not infantile. At its core this is a small personal coming-of-age drama about the evolution of a child of the 1950s as he traverses the path of boyhood to adolescence. When it stays within those confines The Tree of Life represents the best Malick has to offer. When it veers off onto tangents related to spirituality cosmology and the future incarnation of the central character it is less successful. Nevertheless the overall impression one has of the film is that its breathtakingly beautiful and dramatically potent. That it falls short of being a modern masterpiece is no shame especially since its easily better than anything else I have seen thus far in 2011. The majority of The Tree of Life follows Jack OBrien (Hunter McCracken) as he struggles through the years separating the innocence of youth from the pragmatism of adulthood. The first-born of three boys Hunter has the weight of expectations on his shoulders and he becomes resentful of it. He views his stern father (Brad Pitt) as a dictator and his mother (Jessica Chastain) as weak because she does not stand up to her husband. The older he grows the more Jack becomes eaten up by anger until a breaking point is reached. Meanwhile even though a majority of the day-to-day events are presented through Jacks eyes there are chapters reserved for the perspectives of his parents and these help round out the characterizations and allow viewers to understand that the OBriens are what might be termed an ""ordinary"" family for those living in rural Texas during the 1950s. Mom is the nurturer and Dad doesnt spare the rod but both love their children in their own ways with Mom more apt to display her affection than Dad. In addition to presenting this small personal tale Malick attempts to put things into a larger metaphysical context. Hes somewhat less successful in this endeavor than when evoking the ""reality"" of Jacks experiences growing up. The film occasionally flashes forward to an adult Jack (played by Sean Penn) who is seen navigating the concrete jungle of a city and is occasionally glimpsed wandering across a (metaphorical) desert-scape. Also early in the proceedings there is a 15-minute interlude that depicts the creation of Earth the beginnings of life the era of the dinosaurs and the events presaging the rise of man. Although this sequence is enjoyable enough on its own rights it feels like it belongs more as part of a History Channel/Discovery Channel documentary than as a cohesive segment of The Tree of Life. I understand what Malick is trying to accomplish but I dont think he achieves his objective. The ""creation"" sequence does not expand the movies horizons and reveal some greater truth about the place of the individual in the continuum of time and space. And the Sean Penn scenes offer little beyond an assurance that Jack grows up to be a man whos unsure of the meaning of life. They seem largely superfluous except as a way to provide Sean Penn with some screen time. Unlike many period piece coming-of-age stories The Tree of Life does not stake its success or failure on its ability to conjure feelings of nostalgia. Malicks depiction of a middle decade of the last century is ruthlessly accurate illustrating the bad alongside the good without rose-tinting the lens. The films strength is two-fold it looks fabulous (one of the directors enduring hallmarks - the same claim can be made of his previous four efforts regardless of their other strengths and weaknesses) and it captures the essence of the era and the characters through tiny moments. Consider for example a scene in which Jack approaches his father while the man is working on the car. Once glance by the character (and the camera) at the jack elevating the car is enough to convey an immense amount of information. It could slip so easily... Nothing is said and nothing is done. But we understand. The Tree of Life overflows with instances like this. Potential throw-away scenes become building blocks. There are no ""good"" or ""evil"" individuals in Malicks movie - just human beings in all their hazy shades of gray. The ""modern day"" Jack scenes are unremarkable except in that the photographic composition remains outstanding (there are a lot of low-angle shots which make the skyscrapers more imposing than they might otherwise be). Penns version of the character is poorly developed; its difficult to get beyond the actor. The danger in having a well-known thespian appear in this sort of part is that the performer never becomes buried in the character. As good an actor as Penn is he is larger than life and we find ourselves seeing ""Sean Penn"" not ""Jack OBrien."" Contrast this with Brad Pitt who has the time and opportunity to become submerged in his role. Pitt is excellent as is Jessica Chastain a relatively fresh face with a number of upcoming credits on her resume. Pitt and Chastain however are upstaged by Hunter McCracken whose heartfelt and credible work as Jack earns him recognition as one of the best young actors to arrive on the scene in recent memory. This is his feature debut; it will be interesting to see where the currents of his career take him. Regardless this is as promising a beginning as one could hope for. The most controversial element of The Tree of Life is the special effects-laden speculation about the history of the planet. Having employed the input of numerous scientists in crafting this segment Malick at least is able to deflect criticism about inaccuracy and sensationalism (although ironically The Tree of Life can now be sold as a ""true"" summer movie with cataclysms dinosaurs and a mass extinction meteor strike). The inclusion of this interlude however feels artificial and forced. Many viewers will find themselves taken completely out of the experience. And the pretentious voiceover that occasionally occurs during this chapter fails in its goal of tying everything together. One cannot speak of a Malick film without mentioning composition. Few living filmmakers pay as much attention to cinematography and music. The dialogue in The Tree of Life is sparse; composer Alexandre Desplat (using both material of his own creation and various classical pieces) fills in the gaps in which we might normally expect talking. His music like the images brought to the screen by Emmanuel Lubezki add color and depth to the emotions of the characters. They emphasize without being ostentatious. The Tree of Life looks and sounds as sublime as Malicks previous effort The New World but has a stronger emotional attachment. It is far more than style over substance. Although the creation segment and the Sean Penn ""future peeks"" do not work (despite their thematic linking) they are neither off-putting nor do they detract greatly from the overall experience. This is a fine emotionally rich character-based tale with aspirations of being something greater. Robert Browning once wrote that ""a mans reach should exceed his grasp."" With The Tree of Life Terrence Malick has taken that to heart.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jun 3 2011 Culture Terrence Malicks latest film is his most personal--and at times most maddening--to date The Tree of Life Terrence Malicks magisterial inquiry into faith and redemption begins in the 1960s with the delivery of a telegram. A boy has died at age 19--how and where (Vietnam?) is never made explicit. What is clear is the grief of his mother (Jessica Chastain) a grief that enfolds us as fully as it does her. Told by a priest that ""Hes in Gods hands now"" she replies ""He was in Gods hands the whole time wasnt he?"" While she is adrift her husband (Brad Pitt) is closed and stoic his chin jutting like a rock amid the sea of sorrow. From this portrait of loss Malick brings us forward to contemporary Houston and the ruminations of the boys older brother Jack (Sean Penn) grown into a manhood empty of joy and full of reproach--in particular for the father he still blames for that long-ago death. These are remarkably the first scenes of Malicks directorial career set in the present day and his distaste for modernity for skyscrapers and their sharp sterile angles is evident in every meticulously composed frame. Evident but not without irony Jack caged in the chrome-and-glass prison of urban life is himself an architect. No better to rewind to a time before there were steel beams and superstructures and architects--way way back to the unfurling of the cosmos the birth of the Sun the Earths magmic infancy and watery adolescence. We watch a snake-necked plesiosaur as it sprawls beached and dying its head swaying balefully. Another ancient reptile--a baby parasaurolophus?--is pinned by the talons of a fleet-footed predator but receives an unlikely reprieve. It is of course temporary Pitching through space is an asteroid with Earths name on it a cosmic hammer destined to smite out nearly a planets worth of living things. What these images ask is the death of one boy seen through so wide a lens? It would be wrong to say that the films subsequent chapter--by far its longest--attempts to answer that question. Rather The Tree of Life satisfies itself with meditations on questions too big to be answered. But as Malicks movie at last settles down in suburban Waco in the 1950s it does acquire the shape of conventional storytelling. The OBriens Mr. (Pitt) and Mrs. (Chastain) bring into the world a son Jack (played in youth by Hunter McCracken); another R.L. (Laramie Eppler); and a third Steve (Tye Sheridan)--though this last is so marginal to the proceedings that he barely registers. The boys mother is love incarnate applying iodine to cuts and playing hide and seek behind the curtains. Their father stern and growing ever sterner offers lectures on lifes cruelties. ""Your mothers naive"" he tells them. ""It takes fierce will to get ahead in this world."" In this central passage of the film Malick captures the tone and texture of boyhood with uncanny precision the appetite for risk and transgression--with electricity with BB guns with hapless amphibians--the beckoning mystery of dark attics and abandoned houses the endlessness of days. Jack the eldest has the wary worried eyes of the first-born; R.L. the carefree vagueness of the second child. There are a few moments of seemingly misplaced magic in this section of the film--a chair that moves by itself a shot of Mom floating Poppins-like on the breeze--but for the most part Malick hews to the real unpacking the familys dramas in humane minutely observed detail. It is impossible not to wonder how much of this story is autobiographical Malick did after all spend some of his boyhood in Waco and he had two younger brothers one of whom killed himself while abroad. Yet whether or not the details of The Tree of Life align with the directors own youth is perhaps irrelevant. Of the five films Malick has made in his long and circumspect career this is the one he has made most clearly for himself and we are in some sense bystanders to this communion. And a communion it is. As in the directors earlier work voiceover often crowds out dialogue altogether as if the gloriously textured cinematography (courtesy of Emmanuel Lubezki) is merely the backdrop for a conversation the characters--and through them Malick himself--are conducting with God. ""Where were You?"" Jack asks after witnessing a boy drown at Austins Barton Springs. ""You let a boy die. You let anything happen."" Later his mother declares ""The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love your life will flash by."" Such proclamations occasionally prompt the film to teeter between pretension and naivete Heidegger and Hallmark. But Malicks gifts are such that it remains evocative and enriching the sentimentality never quite tipping into bathos. Until alas the final act. As the long central tale in Waco winds down with an emotional epiphany Malick jerks us abruptly back to the present day for a metaphysical one. Without going into detail I will say that it takes place on a beach that it involves Penn again as the grown Jack and that it is as soggy as one might fear from that combination of factors. Some viewers may find this conclusion moving; I was instead reminded of the finale of Lost a comparison that can in no way be construed as a compliment. Malick has been down this road before. When woven into a narrative his extraordinary visual eye and reliance on introspective voiceover can bring depth and power to even the slenderest story. But without that tether his talents can meander as they did in the errant middle portion of The Thin Red Line. Structurally The Tree of Life is an inversion of that film an engrossing central tale bookended by preambles that never quite adhere and a conclusion that rather than help unify the whole spins it into another dimension altogether. The result is a beautiful messy film at times lyrical intimate and uplifting; at others vast inscrutable and maddening. Whatever our feelings its hard to imagine Malick would have wanted it any other way.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Starring Sean Penn Brad Pitt Jessica Chastain Director Terrence Malick Release Opened Jun 3 2011  Editorial Review Far-reaching but poorly groundedBy Ann HornadayFriday June 3 2011""The Tree of Life"" is one of those movies that exists to taunt movie critics daring them to reduce it to simple elements of plot character and structure loftily transcending quibbles with continuity and sense. Is Terrence Malicks hotly anticipated movie the masterwork of the American cinemas most gifted auteur or a self-indulgent occasionally shockingly simplistic muddle of philosophical noodlings and overstated impressions?The answer of course is Yes. ""The Tree of Life"" is both good and bad great and fatally flawed transporting and disappointingly literal. The sprawling story of a mans quest to reconcile a contradictory parental legacy ""The Tree of Life"" ties that search to more metaphysical questions having to do with God Creation Truth and Beauty. Amazingly Malick makes these connections work pungently evoking both suburban life in 1950s mid-America and the explosive beginnings of the universe with equal vividness and power.Its when he underlines then italicizes for good measure that his mistrust of his audience gets the better of him. At its best ""The Tree of Life"" makes the viewer lean forward eager to enter Malicks own dreamy poetic consciousness. At worst it leads to the vague feeling that were listening to the meanderings of someone whos not sure were smart enough to keep up.That said there are several reasons to see ""The Tree of Life"" not the least of which is Brad Pitt who here reminds filmgoers what a gifted actor he is in roles that call less for classically trained disquisitions than vibrant telegraphed emotions. As a character named Mr. OBrien Pitt plays the patriarch of the 1950s family that lives in a leafy Texas suburb. A hard-jawed embittered martinet Mr. OBrien brings up his three boys with a toxic combination of intimidation and commanding affection -- mixed messages brought into even sharper relief by the healing gentle presence of Mrs. OBrien (Jessica Chastain). Its revealing and open to feminist interpretation that her Titian-haired angel of mercy says virtually nothing in the course of ""The Tree of Life"" instead expressing her angelic ethereality through gossamer smiles and beatific glances.Sean Penn looking decidedly pained plays the oldest OBrien son Jack as an adult who announces the cardinal theme of ""The Tree of Life"" early in the film ""There are two ways through life the way of nature and the way of grace."" (Its clear who was who in his childhood.) While the adult Jack wanders a contemporary cityscape his narration takes on the rhythms of a psalm his questions ""Who are we to you?"" and ""Answer me"" leading to a bravura sequence of light steam smoke and fire that eventually gives way to shots of cells jellyfish a few dinosaurs and hammerhead sharks circling.Its an audacious sequence full of wonder and verve and Malick calibrates it perfectly to dovetail with the birth of Jack himself. Less a narrative than a series of sharp shards of memory the next segment of ""The Tree of Life"" traces his life with Father whose mercurial fearsome force Jack fuses with Gods power at its most fickle and inscrutable. In vivid set pieces in the OBrien home Pitt Chastain and a trio of gifted young actors bring to life the spontaneous joys and terrors that will surely ring true to anyone for whom innocent childhood mischief has swiftly curdled into a sense of irredeemable sin.Its in these intersections of the domestic and the cosmic that ""The Tree of Life"" thrums with the kind of profound simplicity Thornton Wilder captured in ""Our Town."" And theres unlikely but powerful harmony to be found between these scenes and the primordial ooze that came before (when one of the OBrien kids thinks he has found a dinosaur bone its possible to think ""The Tree of Life"" is simply the story of one plot of land).But these fleeting indelible moments are all but obliterated by the framing device featuring Penn whose role here feels cursory gratuitous and finally hopelessly artificial. Whats more Malick and his team of five editors never make it clear precisely which son Penn is portraying an unforced error that creates much unnecessary confusion.The mismatch comes into most painful relief during ""The Tree of Lifes"" climactic sequence during which the filmmakers attempt to reconcile Nature and Grace succumbs to pictorial cliches heavenly choirs and Yoda-like pronouncements. As it happens Malick brings things full circle which gratifyingly returns the audience to the most potent ideas and emotions of ""The Tree of Life."" Thats when it becomes clear that they havent watched a movie as much as come under a dizzyingly seductive spell.Contains some thematic material.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + . . . And on the eighth day Terrence Malick took over. He too created heaven earth ocean and the firmament. The bang was big. It was beautiful. It was abstract expressionist and microbial. Great spurts of lava turned kaleidoscopic with rage. Clouds of natural gas billowed up like mastodons. Amniotic corkscrews torpedoed through water. A dinosaur lay felled beside a creek. Bubbles slid along wet earth like prehistoric pucks idling between air-hockey points. Sometimes the soundtrack swelled with Mahler. Sometimes it just swelled with silence. Occasionally the swelling was ponderous. ""Brother. Mother someone whispered ""It was they who led me to Your door.Which is to say that ""The Tree of Life is a collection of conversations that lost souls and true believers have with themselves while keeping their heads to the sky. But the movie is church via the planetarium. Its as if Malick set out to paint the Sistine Chapel and settled for a dome at the Museum of Natural History. The movie heaves with ambition and accomplishment. It kneads together into a single cinematic loaf the start of the universe the activities of a Texas family in the 1950s and several beach-bound New Age promenades.Behold the stupendous imagery (a soaring biplane a woman blissfully levitating above her front lawn) the superb musical selection the subtle jut of Brad Pitts jaw. Could a work of art be more handsome? Could it be more borderline profound? This movie weighs so much yet contains so little. Its all vault and little coin.""The Tree of Life begins with a quotation from the Book of Job. Job and his friends have been debating the power of God. The Lord speaks in order to assert His divinity. Rather than prepare us for a work of tremendous struggle and random suffering at the hands of God Malick carries on in a mood of artistic self-defense. He seizes on mans lack of appreciation for the creative act (well the movie did just win the Palme dOr at the Cannes Film Festival which is a separate matter). Still rather than align himself with poor Job Malick identifies with God. The movie is an act of hubris Can you feel it? Can you understand it? Can you top it?Yet whats crucial to Malicks force as filmmaker is that his hubris is free of arrogance. He continues to create the illusion of innocence. Seeing God is a privilege that humbles and awes him. Thats hardly a simple achievement. I imagine that one of the reasons Malick has made just five films in 38 years is that he feels he can work only when the spirit moves him. The grandeur of his imagery -- whether its this new film or his four previous ones (""Badlands ""Days of Heaven ""The Thin Red Line and ""The New World) -- seems to be in the service of or in deference to a higher power. The reason the Book of Job feels like such a self-mischaracterization is that Malick has always seemed to be a Genesis man. Each of his movies imagines a despoiled Eden. This is the first to embrace paradise found. But it may just be that Malicks strongest mode isnt existential contentment. Its eco-social dismay. ""The Tree of Life is rooted in Malicks Texas boyhood. Jack (Hunter McCracken) -- the truculent version of him that appears in the film -- is nurtured by the abundance of his mothers love and bewildered by the complexity of his fathers. The mother is a housewife (Jessica Chastain) who loves her three boys without condition. The father (Pitt) works in aeronautics and his affection is entirely conditional. She tries to instill a relationship with God -- once she points to the sky and tells the boys ""Thats where God lives. The father tries to establish fear of his authority and instill a sense of masculinity. The disappointment in Pitts face when the sons fail to demonstrate a proficiency in learning to fight is the most human expression hes ever made. With mom they zoom around the house. With dad theyre ambivalently in awe. Before youre with the heavenly father you have to put up with the earthly one. If hes not asking whether you love him hes making you open and close the screen door 50 times.These scenes gently occur in and around their home and along the familys quiet but eventful street and they fall like confetti. Its quite a show. But when its over all you have is a pile of scraps. The domestic life lacks the wonder of the celestial stuff. To represent birth Malick presents the pedestrian metaphor of a child swimming free from a sunken house. Making the mother a mystic and the father an industrialist creates a fine dichotomy. But Jack grows into an architect played in a few cutaways by Sean Penn who rides elevators and wanders a skyscraper. He looks miserable like a man whose punishment for choosing the wrong path is this Ayn Rand afterlife.No tension comes from these images. They accumulate but they dont build. It looks as if the many scenes of young Jack at play with his brothers and friends will amount to something that his witnessing one of his brothers making a musical connection with their father might solidify into a kind of Abel-and-Cain resentment. Its for naught since Malick has so steadily liberated himself from narrative that not even allegory interests him.The scenes of boys rumbling through yards and houses and fields throwing stones at glass strapping frogs to toy rockets simply holding each other as they weep in grass come on like remembered dreams as opposed to dreams themselves. (Charles Burnett and David Gordon Green are two filmmakers whove framed childs play as a holy rite. Green did so in seeming tribute to Malick and Burnett.) In ""The Tree of Life the rush and flutter of images have the heft of important memories but lack the reverie of great slumbers. Jean Cocteau made opium dreams. With David Lynch the dreams are psychotically alive. ""Days of Heaven and ""The Thin Red Line operate at such high levels of evocative reverie that you want to drape them with ""do not disturb signs.""The Tree of Life could use a disturbance. When Chastain hovers above the lawn or a chair appears to move itself its a declarative moment not a supernatural or metaphysical one. This doesnt feel true of the planetarium stuff. Thats all full of wonder. The scenes on the beach purport to be about the search for meaning. But with people staring at and caressing each other as the tide comes in with a commedia dellarte mask sinking in the sea it feels like Rapture kitsch.The movie dares you to wonder whether Malick has completely lost touch with reality. Thats a trick. He has never appeared to harbor a direct interest in our times. In 1973s ""Badlands Malick was thinking loosely about the 1950s. In 1978s ""Days of Heaven he was thinking about the 1910s. In ""The Thin Red Line it was 1942. And at the start of the 21st century with ""The New World he was rethinking the 17th. Malick barely dips a toe in 2011. ""The Tree of Life is about both the dawn of time and the appearance of its suspension. Shots of skyscrapers imply modernity without really engaging it -- it could be now it could be 3035.People already feel protective of this movie and of Malick whos 67 as if his purity couldnt withstand scrutiny Hes a visionary and an artist and those are dying traits in major American moviemakers now. Shouldnt that suffice? That reverence also dramatizes the downside of standing at some visionaries feet You dont always see what they see. When Malick presents a great conclusive boreal splotch some will perceive in it Stanley Kubricks climactic star child from ""2001. Some will detect God. Some will have the distinct impression that theyve just been spritzed at the big cologne counter in the sky. That feels right.

Comments (23) click to enlarge The Tree of Life Recommended Video Rated PG-13  138 minutes  2011 A masterpiece this fifth feature by Terrence Malick manages to reconcile the emotional force of his 70s classics Badlands and Days of Heaven with the epic naturalism of his more recent comeback films The Thin Red Line (1998) and The New World (2005). Brad Pitt gives an impressively sober tight-lipped performance as the rigid 1950s patriarch of a little family in Waco Texas a decent but angry man whose strict treatment of his three young sons is countered by the love and Christian grace of his ethereal wife (Jessica Chastain). Interspersed with this humble family conflict are scenes of the worlds creation that Malick concocted with the legendary special effects artist Douglas Trumbull (2001 A Space Odyssey). These audacious sequences cant help but evoke the metaphysical questing of 2001 and in fact The Tree of Life often feels like a religious response to Stanley Kubricks cold cerebral view of our place in the universe.

Directed by Terrence Malick. (PG-13. 138 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If someone gave you as a gift a bag of diamonds and rocks you would not see it as ""a mixed bag."" You would see it as a bag of diamonds with some rocks that can be easily pushed aside and you would be happy to be rich. In the same way Terrence Malicks ""The Tree of Life"" is at times trying and perplexing but it also contains some of the most psychologically insightful and ecstatic filmmaking imaginable. Malick shows you the world that you know but he shows it in such a fever that you see it not differently but completely. Its a vision so alive to the mystery in everything that the simple depiction of a man walking into an office building feels like a feast of limitless possibility and geometric variety. To see ""The Tree of Life"" is to wish you could go through life seeing things in this way. There would be no fear of death because each moment would be so full as to contain lifetimes. From the first moments Malick presents his film as a contrast between two ways of understanding human existence. There is the way of nature which sees only struggle and looks for reasons to be unhappy and there is the way of grace which is in touch with love and the broad movements of the universe. The way of nature is embodied by Brad Pitt as a hard-charging husband and father - its a lovely performance from Pitt whose control-freak facade never completely hides the vulnerability motivating it. Jessica Chastain as his wife embodies the way of grace. They live with their three children in a Texas suburb in the 1950s and are seen through the memory of their eldest son Jack (Sean Penn) looking back from the present. Related Stories The Tree of Life As in ""The New World"" voice-over narration to the accompaniment of subjective shots of trees and sky gives us the characters inner thoughts. These produce a unique effect. Its as if were seeing a dream of the past and hearing mental vibrations that either randomly or because of their particular strength happened to survive time. The feeling is one of privilege to be picking up on precious currents of consciousness seemingly lost to the world. At its most basic ""The Tree of Life"" vividly replicates in cinematic terms the way we remember. There are general memories moods and sensations and then there are incidents and bits of conversation that are recalled with absolute present-tense lucidity. And so the incidents of voice-over are interspersed with straightforward scenes showing this 1950s family. Malick is trying to give us life as it is consciously experienced the unceasing inner monologue and its interplay with the outside environment the thoughts of the past mixing with the suspended and yet always available present. The ambition behind such an attempt is enormous and Malicks success is complete. But he doesnt stop there. In ""The Tree of Life"" he doesnt only want to show what life and consciousness feel like. He wants to capture the nature of life - what life is. To this end he films waterfalls and mountains gives us long minutes of churning multi-colored ooze floating in space and even includes a brief dinosaur interlude. He is trying to give us the mind of God. No more than that. He is trying to film God. When he stays within the multiple minds of his various characters Malick is working here at the level of genius. His handheld camera hovers with a sense of impending revelation. The beauty is beyond description. But when he ventures into explorations of the universe and its origins the work becomes general and less interesting liked warmed-over Kubrick. Still there is little doubt that ""The Tree of Life"" will stand as the cinematic achievement of the year. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

"Tree of Life movie review starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Malicks ages of manThe famously sporadic director ponders the human and the divine in The Tree of Life -- 3.5 starsJune 02 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJessica Chastain Laramie Eppler Brad Pitt and Tye Sheridan in ""The Tree of Life.""In 1975 writer-director Terrence Malick told a writer from Sight and Sound magazine ""Theres something about growing up in the Midwest. Theres no check on you. People imagine its the kind of place where your behavior is under constant observation where you really have to toe the line. They got that idea from Sinclair Lewis. But people can really get ignored there and fall into bad soil.""In Malicks first feature ""Badlands"" (1973) that soil produced the serial killer played by Martin Sheen. Malicks fifth feature in 38 years ""The Tree of Life"" which recently won the Palme dOr at the Cannes Film Festival illustrates a subtler erosion the gradual bittersweet coming of age of a young boy pulled beween two parents in 1950s Waco Texas -- a place of infinite Eden-like greenery a wellspring of brotherly love and always potential threats to that love.Scant on story even lighter on dialogue ""The Tree of Life"" will drive a lot of people crazy with its loose flaps and obvious casualties of the editing stage. (Fourth-billed Fiona Shaw plays ""Grandmother"" and has perhaps 30 seconds of screen time.) American films most ardent naturalist here offers alternately blunt and allusive spiritual inquiries in which several characters grieving the loss of a loved one ask God Why? Surrounding his presumably autobiographical act of remembrance and atonement (Malick it is rumored lost a brother to suicide) the film supplies a lengthy sequence 20 minutes in depicting no less than the formation of the universe; the birth of the planet; the dinosaur age; and then audaciously a return to Eisenhower-era Waco. An epilogue which will please virtually no one (its surprisingly banal in both ideas and imagery) brings us all the way to the shores of eternity where we might meet our former selves and our departed loved ones as we make our way to the light.Call it outlandishly pompous messy whatever. Ive seen it twice now and though this childhood was not my childhood and my spiritual yearnings are not Malicks ""The Tree of Life"" already has come to mean a great deal to me. Malicks latest captures a series of glorious ""found"" moments between the brothers played by the young actors Hunter McCracken and Laramie Eppler. These are some of the truest fragments of a childs life romanticized without being falsified ever caught in an American film.Born in Ottawa Ill. and raised in Texas and Oklahoma by parents whose uneasy emotional dynamic informs ""The Tree of Life"" Malick states his intentions early on. ""Father. Mother. Always you wrestle inside me"" So goes one of many murmured voice-over confessions spoken by Sean Penn who plays the adult version of the troubled boy at the heart of this film.It begins with a quote from the Book of Job and flirts with parallels to Cain and Abel among other Biblical figures. The scenario tapped into place by Malick is pure allegory a struggle between ""the way of Nature"" and ""the way of Grace."" Penn whose role clearly has been shaved in the final cut is our conduit Jack OBrien. A lost soul this modern-day architect looks back on the unexplained death of the younger of two brothers years earlier when the brother was 19. Jack recalls his father (Brad Pitt) and mother (Jessica Chastain). The father were told represents Nature. He finds ""reasons to be unhappy"" and converts his own frustrations in business (we hear of patents for inventions that never come to fruition) into perplexing tough-love lessons for his boys. Their mother a vision of free-spirited light as portrayed by Chastain contrasts sharply with Pitts disappointed and blinkered disciplinarian who leans hard on his oldest Jack and then deals with the regrets.The father was originally to be played by Heath Ledger but Pitt -- hardly in the same league -- turns out to be ideal. Like all central performances in Malicks work Pitts isnt really central to this films success or failure. Actors do a different sort of acting in a Malick project falling away from ordinary interpretation and into pure behavior. As the father Pitt registers visually first (his jaw set tight his uneasy expressions of physical affection more like miniature power struggles showing whos in charge) emotionally second and dramatically a distant third. Theres something in this mans hypocrisies and anger though that connects with the actor.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesTerrence Malicks To the Wonder lost in a beautifully...April 18 2013Tree of Life triumphs at CannesMay 22 2011Cannes Palme dOr Race Looks Wide-OpenMay 25 2013Professor`s Dream Of A Prairie Is Coming To Life At FermilabJanuary 25 1989Find More Stories AboutSoilTerrence MalickTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-mov-0603-tree-of-life-20110602,0,3599816.column",200,thetreeoflife13,thetreeoflife,chicagotribune

A strange movie worth watching. Matt Gillmer Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint A masterpiece creates an original world. Therefore its unlikely to fit the world of the spectator. ""The Tree of Life"" the demanding new film from writer/director Terrence Malick will stretch every viewers boundaries. Its a flawed but impressive experiment the sort of shoot-the-moon gamble that cinema cant do without. This is the famously reclusive perfectionist Malicks fifth film in four decades yet with that slender output hes carved a unique niche. He explores solidly American material with introspective lyricism and lush tactile images of nature rather than straightforward plot and dialogue. ""The Tree of Life"" is a tapestry of human and natural strands whose main thread follows three brothers growing up in midcentury Waco Texas. It is also a meditation on creation and death and how one family fits into the cosmos. Malick marshals gorgeous special effects and stunning nature photography to show the origin of the universe -- stars exploding oceans forming cells dividing dinosaurs roaming. He follows with intimate scenes of family life that have an almost documentary quality. By turns down-to-earth and transcendental his film settles into no genre unless you call it the coming-of-age story of the universe. Repeatedly worlds collide. The film contemplates the line between dream and reality counterpoints suburban lawns and prehistoric rain forests and contrasts the personalities of a warring parent and child. Brad Pitt plays the father Mr. OBrien a disciplinarian who demands to be called ""sir."" Jessica Chastain is the tender mother a radiant creature without a name. We follow the OBrien boys through the rituals of childhood meals and baths church and school and languorous evenings at play. The characters speech is as oblique as half-overheard conversation. Much of the film is narrated by muted interior monologue. The soaring classical soundtrack speaks for them. Mother is the boys playmate confidante and spiritual tutor. She instructs them to follow the path of grace through life and ""love every blade of grass every ray of light"" rather than pursue the way of nature which ""finds reasons to be unhappy."" At one point a butterfly settles onto Chastains hand as if she were St. Francis welcoming a bird. She flies through the air herself in one surreal snippet. Mr. OBrien is a creature of the earth fixated on the dead spots in his lawn and walking with a heavy tread. He wants his boys to be tough and manly well prepared to face the challenges of adulthood. As he tries to instill the ""fierce will it takes to get ahead in this world"" his firstborn Jack (Hunter McCracken in an extraordinary debut) comes to loathe him. Fox Searchlight Fox Searchlight Brad Pitt in ""The Tree of Life"" For all their antagonism neither man has come to terms with the sudden death of Jacks brother R.L. (Laramie Eppler) his fathers favorite. We see recurring images of votive candles being lighted by Pitt and Sean Penn who plays Jack as a troubled adult. Pitt paints a portrait in full a man of art and science hot-tempered yet loving in his way and full of veiled disappointment. McCracken is immensely touching adoring his mother resenting his father and gradually growing apart from his roots. Penn plinks a single morose note in his limited screen time and his final scene of reconciliation a banal beach reunion is unworthy of what came before. His character could have been called Angst Man; if hed been edited out of the film altogether nothing much would be lost. Time and again Malick shifts his focus from his characters to cathedral-like trees ancient sandstone canyons or a beach with a lounging dinosaur landscape views that put human concerns in a cosmic perspective. Malick generally prefers enigmas to answers. The film is bookended by views of an indistinct shifting aura of light. Is it the instant before the Big Bang? An angel? The spirit of cinema? Each viewer must decide what it all means. This much is certain Malick loves every ray of light. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Merie Wallace/Twentieth Century Fox The Tree of Life Director Terrence Malick Genre Drama Running Time 138 minutes Rated PG-13 for some thematic material. With Brad Pitt Sean Penn Jessica Chastain Fiona Shaw (Recommended) Watch Clips Wheres Dad? Wheres Dad? Credit Fox Searchlight Pictures Hit Me Hit Me Credit Fox Searchlight Pictures Theres not a frame of The Tree of Life -- not one -- that I wouldnt love to have hanging on a wall in my home. And there are relatively few frames of The Tree of Life that Im sure I entirely understand. The film is gorgeous and abstract leaping around in time and space structured in movements and more like a symphony than a conventional narrative. The film centers on a family in Waco Texas in the 1950s a stern Eisenhower-era patriarch (Brad Pitt); his ethereal pale wife (Jessica Chastain); and their three rambunctious young sons who are torn between them as children often are. ""There are two ways through life the way of nature and the way of grace"" the mother tells one of her sons stating the films theme early on. Theres little doubt which path shes chosen. Shes so filled with grace so crazily idealized by the filmmaker that at one point he has a butterfly alight on her outstretched hand. Pitts patriarch with his jutting jaw and buzz-cut hair is attuned not to grace but to a natural world that can be both nurturing and volcanic. One of their three boys will die at 19 an event so shattering that to make sense of it director Terrence Malick looks to the very origins of the universe. With help from special effects master Douglas Trumbull and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki the director conjures galaxies and nebulae on screen. Planets form. Lava erupts then cools. Life begins with cells plants invertebrates then dinosaurs -- yes dinosaurs including one that exhibits something that almost looks like compassion. I remember reading a James Michener novel once and marveling at its stately narrative pace so unhurried that on page 87 mountain ranges were still forming. This passage in The Tree of Life is like that. Its as if to understand the death of a young man we need to understand everything that led to his creation starting with creation itself. i Father Knows Best Malicks father figure played by Brad Pitt works to harden his sons against lifes disappointments by among other things teaching his son Jack (Hunter McCracken) to fight. Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Fox Searchlight Father Knows Best Malicks father figure played by Brad Pitt works to harden his sons against lifes disappointments by among other things teaching his son Jack (Hunter McCracken) to fight. Fox Searchlight Then were plunged back into an Eden before the fall envisioned as a 50s suburbia thats reportedly not unlike the one the filmmaker grew up in a graceful mom stern dad and three young boys all still happy as they play kick the can break windows and run carefree through white clouds of DDT. Jack the eldest of the boys is ever wary of his father whos been disappointed and hardened by life -- and wants his sons hardened too. Malick is a notoriously painstaking filmmaker. In 34 years hes made just five singular films -- bringing us an austere killing spree in Badlands ravishing wheat fields in Days of Heaven two other strange exquisite treks through history and now this grand loopy spiritual epic. The filmmakers ambitions in The Tree of Life are enormous. Hes made a movie for philosophers thats allegorical not remotely linear and offers the barest intimations of plot. The Tree of Life is astonishing in some spots almost incoherent in others and if it doesnt frustrate you at least some of the time -- particularly at the very end -- youre not paying attention. But theres the throb of poetry in every frame -- and really when was the last time you could say that at the multiplex?

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 27 2011 Save for later Saved Brad Pitt stars in The Tree of Life as the patriarch of a troubled 1950s family raising three boys. Twentieth Century Fox          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If I had to give a two-word review of Terrence Malicks ""The Tree of Life"" it would be ""Wow Huh??""Framed as a movie about a Texas family in the mid-1950s with Brad Pitt as its patriarch its really a cinematic hit list of metaphysical imponderables complete with vast gleaming re-creations of the birth and death of the cosmos solar nebulae dinosaurs protozoa and more flowing magma than you can shake a stick at.By coupling all this primeval hoo-ha with the story of a troubled family Malick is attempting to demonstrate the oneness of the universe I suppose but never has a human drama seemed punier in the vast scheme of things. You cant blame the family exactly. Its just about impossible not to get upstaged by a solar nebula. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The film begins with a quote from the Book of Job - always a tip-off that deep think lies ahead. Other tip-offs Malick uses swatches of scores from such composers as Berlioz Ligeti Brahms Mahler Gorecki and Holst. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gradually the movie the part that isnt intergalactic anyway coalesces around the drama of the eldest of the three OBrien boys Jack (Hunter McCracken) who is inexorably deformed by his fathers martinet ways. (Sean Penn looking lost plays the adult Jack now a Houston architect in a series of mostly wordless scenes as he wanders through gleaming office towers and desertscapes.)Jacks mother (Jessica Chastain) is as ethereal as her husband is rock-ribbed. (Pitt who is rather good in the film seems to have retained his jutting chin from ""Inglourious Basterds."") She represents idealized femininity in this neo-Wild West setting. Her belief is that the only way to be happy is to love and yet the death of the middle son R.L. (Laramie Eppler) is a defining moment for her - for everyone in the family. Is it random cruelty of the gods? Punishment? Chance?People like to describe Malicks movies as symphonic structures that dispense with the normal logic of dramatic development and theres some truth to this. But its also true that Malick has never been adept at straightforward exposition. For a movie that is supposed to be so intuitive and avant-garde ""The Tree of Life"" nevertheless relies a lot on Psych 1A tropes. The relationship between Jack and his father is textbook Freud. The film is light as a feather and as heavy as a sandbag.This is Malicks fifth movie since ""Badlands"" his first and best back in 1973. He likes to work slow. ""The Tree of Life"" was filmed three years ago. Five editors are listed in the credits. Of such things are mystiques created at least in Hollywood where taking your own sweet time for the sake of ""art"" is tantamount to heresy - or deification.With all this mythmaking going for him Malick has always for me been a mixed bag. He has a singular way of seeing - poeticized yet rigorous as if everything was being looked at for the first time. (The great cinematography in ""The Tree of Life"" is by Emmanuel Lubezki.) His films are shot through with a haunting fatalism.What he lacks is the storytellers gift. Much has been made of how he has rewritten the language of cinema but I dont think hes rewritten the rules so much as hes skirted them. In film after film his characters express their inner longings their own true selves in somber voice-over narration that is invariably highfalutin. Dont Malicks people ever muse about say taking out the garbage or going out for a burger?With Malick everything is ultimately about the essences about finalities and although this may have philosophic heft its rough on audiences. Its also something of a sham. Nonstop seriousness doesnt tell us much about the true nature of seriousness. For that you also need the leavening of levity of the mundane. Malick is often wonderful around the edges of a scene but he cant accomplish much in the ""normal"" range.There is something essentially inhuman about his cinematic approach as if people only existed as philosophical conceits. Perhaps thats why despite its many sorrowful passages ""The Tree of Life"" never really grabbed hold of me as a work of emotional intelligence. Its a phenomenal artwork but for all its solar flares its cold to the touch. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for some thematic material.)

Brad Pitt in The Tree of Life Im typing this review outdoors looking up intermittently at the leaves of a tree in the wind. It seemed an appropriate place to work given that the movie Im reviewing is The Tree of Life in which the director Terrence Malick returns obsessively to an image hes long favored a tall tree seen from far below sun filtering through its dense branches. But truth be told Im doing a crap job of looking at this tree. When Malick sees a tree he really see s it--and by some alchemy of camerawork language and music Im still trying to figure out he offers you that experience in such a way that it feels like your own. Heres a testament to this reclusive stubborn visionary directors stunning achievement His films can change the way you look at the world by showing you how another person sees it. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Tree of Life is Malicks fifth movie in a 38-year-long career as a filmmaker. That averages out to about one movie every eight years--though in practice the gap between films has varied from as short as five years (between his first film Badlands and his second Days of Heaven) to as long as 20 (between Days of Heaven and his next The Thin Red Line).His films feel like events both for their rarity and for their uniqueness of voice Malick doesnt seem to come from any particular school or movement or indeed era. Advertisement This timeless quality is more apparent than ever in The Tree of Life a movie that is in large part about time and the mystery of our passage through it. ""Where were you when I laid the earths foundations?"" God asks Job in the Biblical epigraph that opens the film. In the context of the Book of Job this reads as a somewhat guiltifying rhetorical question Who are you to complain buddy? But Malicks intent is to pose the question seriously. Where were we when the earths foundations were laid whether by God or by the inexorable laws of science? (Either way the mystery is equally great.) And if we could somehow be present to witness the beginning of everything would that help us to understand our own lives? The particular life at stake is that of a man named Jack played by Sean Penn as an adult and by Hunter McCracken as a child. (McCracken is a nonprofessional actor a Texas boy Malick found at the end of a long casting search whose round serious face registers emotion with the sensitivity of a wind chime.) Jack the adult seems anxious and disconnected; an architect he spends most of his days alone in sterile skyscrapers and cold minimalist apartments. But Jacks memories of his Waco childhood are just the opposite filled with trees and rivers and the warm pressing clutter of family life. That doesnt mean Jacks childhood was completely happy--his father (Brad Pitt) an aerospace engineer could be rigid and tyrannical though he also had a fierce love for his three sons. And like every child Jack struggled with the difficulties of being a human coming to terms with the reality of suffering and the certainty of loss. But wait To fully understand Jacks situation you have to know something about his mother (Jessica Chastain) a nature-loving free spirit who might in the Romantic era have been called a ""beautiful soul."" (Shes certainly a beautiful body a tall freckled redhead with a pre-Raphaelite gleam.) And you should probably witness a moment or two of his mothers childhood. And--oh screw it to get the whole picture you really need to go back to the Big Bang. In a perhaps 15-minute flashback (hard to tell as this movie suspends the viewers sense of time) Malick takes us through a few billion years of cosmic history the formation of the universe stars and planets; the cooling of the Earth; the first microscopic signs of life; and eventually the dinosaurs two of whom we witness as they enact a short reptile drama that will be the subject of many a post-movie discussion. How exactly this cosmic-history segment gets away with not being portentous is anybodys guess. Maybe its the music a mix of soaring Romantic themes (Mahler Brahms) and a limpid original score by Alexandre Desplat. Or the special effects which are extraordinary but never spectacular. Kubricks shots of outer space in 2001 A Space Odyssey felt ominous and mythic; Malicks have the quiet accuracy of a NASA video sent from space. Watching the asteroid that will kill off the dinosaurs hurtle toward the atmosphere we think ""There was a moment when this happened"" and are awed. But the astronomical flashback isnt without a measure of wit as well; the sheer scope of it is a kind of joke on the impossibility of storytelling. The notion of returning to the birth of the universe to kick off your movie is a way of going Tristram Shandy--who couldnt tell his story without a detailed account of his conception--one better. The middle section of the film in which we follow Jacks childhood in a series of fragmented memories from birth until about the age of 12 is as astonishingly precise a rendering of the way the world looks to a child as Ive seen on film. You know that Emily Dickinson poem about ""a certain slant of light""? Every slant of light in this movie is a certain slant of light evocative of an individual and irreplaceable moment in time. The camera--wielded by Emanuel Lubezki who also performed cinematographic miracles in Children of Men--not only creates visually beautiful images (like the recurring painterly close-ups of the mother rinsing her feet in a lawn sprinkler.) It provides Jacks perspective on what were seeing makes us notice the things he notices whether its light from a jack-o-lantern held down at a toddlers eye level or a tiny momentous shift of expression on a parents face. After the profundity and beauty of this Texas section The Tree of Lifes last 20 minutes in which we rejoin Sean Penn in his skyscraper and accompany him on an enigmatic encounter with his past self felt like a letdown to me a somewhat banal coda to a film that previously soared so dazzlingly high. (I wont say more here but the ending is discussed in the Spoiler Special podcast attached to this review.) Maybe any film that starts with the Big Bang has to end with something of a whimper. The beginning of life--Jacks the earths everyones--is something that however mysteriously has already happened. The end of life is still perhaps mercifully impossible to imagine. In the meantime see this movie. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

"The Tree of Life review Terrence Malicks latest is often profound sometimes puzzling |       NJ.com comments The Tree of Life review Terrence Malicks latest is often profound sometimes puzzling Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 27 2011 at 801 AM updated May 27 2011 at 1127 AM View/Post Comments MERIE WALLACEBrad Pitt and Laramie Eppler in ""The Tree of Life."" At its literally transcendent best ""The Tree of Life"" is a moving illustration of everything the movies can do -- turn thoughts into pictures make dreams into realities transmute life into art. At its occasionally perplexing worst ""Tree of Life"" is a clear declaration of everything director Terrence Malick chooses not to do -- tell clearly linear stories write conventional scenes explain. The two taken together do not make for an easy movie. But they do ensure a complex and often beautiful experience. At its simplest -- and there is very little that is simple here -- ""The Tree of Life"" is about a wealthy architect looking back at his childhood in 1950s Texas where he grew up with a bitter abusive father and an unconditionally loving mother. The emotional whiplash of being caught between the two extremes has never left him -- and the great tragedy of ""The Tree of Life"" is that were there peeking powerlessly into his past as we watch the childs joy and innocence slowly slip away. That is the part of ""The Tree of Life"" that can be easily explained and its superbly acted by Sean Penn in a small part as the grown Jack and Brad Pitt in an unusual one as the stern parent. (How stern? He reprimands his sons for calling him ""Dad"" instead of the more proper ""Father."") It also has two marvelous performances by newer talents -- as the mother Jessica Chastain (who recalls the vulnerable translucent Sissy Spacek of Malicks ""Badlands"") and Hunter McCracken as young Jack his face a summer storm cloud of emotion. Movie Review The Tree of Life (PG-13) Fox Searchlight (138 min.) Directed by Terrence Malick. With Brad Pitt Jessica Chastain Sean Penn. Now playing in New York; opens in Montclair on June 3. Rating note The film contains violence. Stephen Whittys Review THREE AND A HALF STARS But then theres the other deeper part of ""The Tree of Life."" Malick always has had a mystical bent. He once taught philosophy at MIT and his last two films ""The New World"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" mused at length on mans relationship to the natural world. ""The Tree of Life"" goes even deeper starting with a quotation from the Book of Job and an observation -- or maybe just an overheard prayer -- from Jacks mother that ""The nuns taught us there were two ways through life -- the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one youll follow."" Trying to choose grace is a preoccupation for this Catholic family. All of them have constant conversations about it with God or with their better selves or with the past itself. Malick though makes their yearnings real. ""What are we to You"" the mother muses and the film goes into the biggest flashback in cinema history right to the beginning of the universe -- then watches as Earth is formed life begins dinosaurs roam. ""How did I lose you?"" the grown Jack thinks of his mother or perhaps his younger self. ""Wandered. Forgot you."" But then Malick shows Jack literally lost in some biblical desert -- and at the end meeting his own mother and youth on some heavenly beach. Malick cultists will embrace all of this. Doubters are more likely to feel that -- as in his last two films -- the director is more interested in abstract images than dialogue or even drama. It feels at times like a movie for people who prefer humanity to actual humans. Of course some of those charges were lobbed against Stanley Kubrick too. And in some ways ""The Tree of Life"" is Malicks ""2001"" -- and not just because he called on that movies Douglas Trumbull to create another trippy light show or scored it all to classical music. Both sharply smart and maddeningly elusive its yet another film by a great director working at the height of his powers to do something genuinely new. And creating something guaranteed to leave you talking and arguing long after the last frame has faded from the screen.

But images also persist in our memories and continue to move us in mysterious ways. Many of those in Terrence Malicks exquisite and also exasperating new film--his fifth in a career spanning four decades --are remarkable for their grandeur billowing volcanoes churning geysers hissing fumaroles spiral nebulas seen through the eye of the Hubble space telescope. Others are notable for their grandiosity When ""The Tree of Life"" goes over the top it sets altitude records. Some of the most memorable images though are the most fleeting curtains curving gently in a breeze; a newborns tiny foot surrounded by a fathers hand; a mothers lyrical dance of joy; a father switching off the night-table light in his young sons bedroom. ENLARGE Brad Pitt meets a new arrival in Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life Fox Searchlight Tiny and vast eternal and evanescent these are the polarities of a work of art that defies categorization. (Mr. Malicks long-standing defiance of mainstream conventions surely helped his film win the top prize last weekend at the Cannes Film Festival.) Reduced to its essence ""The Tree of Life"" is a free-form meditation--strongly but not literally autobiographical--on the life of a family in small-town Texas in the 1950s. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are the husband and wife identified only as Mr. and Mrs. OBrien. Hunter McCracken is Jack the oldest of their three sons. (Jack is played as an adult by Sean Penn.) The three central primal portraits--father mother first-born child--are astonishingly vivid especially since theyre not conventional performances; the dialogue is sparse and the script dispenses with plot and overt conflict. (Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography ranges from creamy softness to stark majesty. Jack Fisk did the fine understated production design.) What we learn about this family--a lot--comes mainly from thoughts and supplications conveyed in voice-overs and revelatory moments of sweet pleasure hovering menace (how did any of us survive the daily dangers of childhood?) repressed anger explosive rage and through it all bewilderment and grief provoked by a sudden tragedy. Much of the film bespeaks the adult Jacks struggle to understand his mortal journey. What happened to the innocence of childhood? How did his beloved mother endure the pain that came to define her life? Before and after everything else who was the father he loved deeply and hated implacably? (In an admirably minimalist way Mr. Pitt gives equal weight to the fathers tyranny and thwarted dreams.) Jack is not the only questioner. Mr. Malick uses his film to ask the sort of existential questions that he has posed in such earlier works as ""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" Why does misfortune befall good people? How can faith be sustained in the face of tragedy that is by nature incomprehensible? What of God? Where do we belong in the raging indifference of the cosmos? To set the larger context--larger being a colossal understatement--the film gives us a long sequence the likes of which hasnt been since Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" (with special effects by Douglas Trumbull the same wizard who conjured up Mr. Kubricks marvels). Successive segments look back to lifes beginnings--this tree has really deep roots--and out to the rings of Saturn the moons of Jupiter and the infinitude that surrounds us paying special attention to violent creation and violent destruction. You do not come out of this film feeling like the king of the world. How you feel about that sequence may depend in part on your response to nature photography. As it started to unfold I was glad to let go of the family drama long enough to take in titanic vistas on a big screen. And I was touched by the technical simplicity of one particular glimpse of life even though the cumulative effect is somewhat ponderous; theres nothing like Mr. Kubricks stunning metaphor of the ape flinging up a bone that becomes a space station. But the film takes a far more problematic turn in a coda that expresses Jacks quest with surreal images of seeking and finding his way of reunion and reconciliation on a higher plane. Some will find this inspirational; as the last shot ended a woman in my audience called out a passionate ""Amen"" Others will react as I did with dismay --not because of the codas unabashed spirituality but because the banality of its images blurs the beautiful originality of whats come before. Yet ""The Tree of Life"" finds its own way taking nourishment from the grandeur and more than surviving the grandiosity. Daring in concept occasionally daffy in execution and ultimately unforgettable Mr. Malicks film offers a heartfelt answer to the question of where we humans belong-- with each other on this planet bound by love. Watch a clip from ""Kung Fu Panda"" starring Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. ENLARGE The hero of Kung Fu Panda 2 Warner Bros. Pictures Kung Fu Panda 2 The invention of fireworks quickly leads to gunpowder in this lively DreamWorks sequel and then to a secret weapon that threatens the hero with irrelevance or worse. ""How can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?"" asks Po plaintively. Hes the borderline-obese panda turned Dragon Warrior in the first episode and hes got his paws full once again as an evil peacock tries to take over China. No need to worry about him though and no need to wonder why ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" the directorial debut of Jennifer Yuh Nelson is so consistently entertaining. The movies not-so-secret weapon is graphic design. Hardly a scene goes by that isnt visually striking or kinetically thrilling and all of it enhanced by 3-D. The most spectacular set piece is what amounts to a chariot race through the alleys of a medieval city but the costumes and landscapes are sumptuous too and hooray for the idea that when orphaned Po dreams of finding his parents he does so in 2-D. The script could do with more dimensions; theres a surfeit of therapy-based stuff about lost love self-esteem and letting go of the past. Whenever the film lets go with an action sequence though its time to be grateful for computer animation and to keep both eyes peeled for incoming cannonballs. The highly anticipated sequel to The Hangover was released Thursday. ENLARGE The Hangover Part II brings back the original bemused gang in a Thai adventure. Dreamworks The Hangover Part II Its not a good sign that the frenetic denizens of this sequel to the 2009 hit comedy keep declaiming variations on the theme of ""I cant believe its happening again."" I wouldnt say that ""The Hangover Part II"" is a carbon copy of the original but only because no one knows about carbon paper any more. I cant believe how precisely everything does happen again except that what was fresh and surprising in Las Vegas turns rancid and predictable in Bangkok where yet another wedding is scheduled to take place. (The director as before is Todd Phillips.) This time the groom-to-be is Stu the dentist played by Ed Helms who is likened by the scornful father of his Asian bride to white rice pudding. Mr. Helms gets to do a funny riff on that description toward the end but its one of the few bright spots. Bradley Coopers formerly engaging Phil has grown vulgar and unpleasant Zach Galifianakiss Alan dispenses mirthless insults at every opportunity and Ken Jeongs effeminate gangster Mr. Chow is given much more screen time than before with even less justification. Not everything is slavishly duplicated though. Instead of waking up in a Las Vegas hotel room to find a baby the hung-over buddies wake up in a Thai hotel room to find a capuchin monkey. Make Believe Terrifically likable without trying too terribly hard J. Clay Tweels documentary follows six teenage magicians to Las Vegas where they seek the title of Teen World Champion in a competition that draws hopefuls from around the world. The title doesnt do justice to the film which is starting to play in theaters around the country. These talented dedicated kids arent making believe about anything--theyre making art out of shimmering illusion intricate manipulation and blithe misdirection. (In magic as distinct from filmmaking misdirection is a good thing.) Among the contestants are a boundlessly articulate and fatefully beautiful young woman from Malibu Calif. and a tender tentative boy from Japan who isolated in his rural village created his act and his performing self out of whole silk. Why one succeeds and one fails is a mystery more compelling than any we see on stage. DVD FOCUS Badlands (1973) Terrence Malick based his debut feature on a 1958 string of murders across the West by Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate. In his fictionalized--and aestheticized--version Martin Sheen plays Kit the psychopathic killer and Sissy Spacek is Holly his 15-year-old girlfriend who narrates flatly yet hypnotically. (Warren Oates is Hollys father.) Brilliantly controlled and singular in style the film has come to be viewed as masterly and the soullessness at its core as a commentary on American culture. Tak Fujimoto did the ravishingly desolate cinematography. A Little Princess (1995) Emmanuel Lubezki shot this enchanting film with all the warmth he brings to ""The Tree Of Life."" (Look at the color and the quality of the light for a better understanding of why cinematographers were previously called lighting cameramen.) Alfonso Cuaron directed from an adaptation of the Frances Hodgson Burnett novel by Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler. Liesel Matthews is Sara Crewe the young girl forced into servitude at a boarding school in New York when her father fighting with the British forces in World War I is presumably lost in action. Its Kind of a Funny Story (2010) Zach Galifianakis is Bobby a patient in a psych ward whos as mysterious as he is funny and touching. Think of this small smart film as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" blissed out on Wellbutrin. Its the saga of Craig a depressed teen who checks himself into a Manhattan hospital and ends up surrounded by thats right screwy people. Craig is played by Keir Gilchrist from ""United States of Tara""; hes got a sweet spirit and a cockeyed Paul Simon smile. The directors were Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck; they adapted the screenplay from Ned Vizzinis young-adult novel. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com 34 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Ambitious and wildly experimental Terrence Malicks often glorious sometimes exasperating ""The Tree of Life"" tackles Big Questions that likely havent even occurred to Michael Bay and the other purveyors of this seasons expensive brain-dead entertainments. While its entirely possible to dismiss this philosophizing head trip of a movie as pretentious tedious and often inscrutable New Age hooey as a minority of critics did at the Cannes Film Festival (where it went on to take the top prize) you may be doing so at your own peril. Based on my own two viewings ""The Tree of Life"" is likely to inspire more after-screening debate over its meaning than all of the summers other movies combined. Its overflowing with powerful images that will stay with me a long time even if I still cant explain some of them. To me one eye-popping 18-minute sequence alone is worth the price of admission. Partly inspired by photography from the Hubble Space Telescope and co-supervised by Douglas Trumbull (the legendary special-effects genius behind ""2001 A Space Odyssey"") this part of the movie elaborately and beautifully depicts the beginnings of the universe and life on Earth up to the age of dinosaurs. Its accompanied like the rest by a soaring Alexandre Desplat score that heavily samples classical composers. Malick the enigmatic writer-director of just four movies since 1978 leaves it to the viewer to figure out how this awe-inspiring sequence relates to the fractured more intimate story that takes up the other two hours of ""The Tree of Life."" Calling it a story may be a stretch for what we see a series of spectacularly beautiful if fragmentary recollections by an anguished architect (Sean Penn) of his elegiac gradually more stressful childhood in Waco Texas in the 1950s. There are barely any actual conversations in these scenes some of which last only seconds. Dialogue tends to be mumbled. There are whispered barely audible (in some cases deliberately inaudible) voice-over prayers and lamentations mostly triggered by the long-ago off-screen death of one of Penns brothers in the opening scene. The film is dominated by Brad Pitt in perhaps his most impressive performance as an inventor who alternates between treating his three sons with carefully controlled love and military-style discipline -- especially the oldest (excellently played by newcomer Hunter McCracken) who grows up to be Penn. A crew-cutted martinet so formal that he works on his car in tailored gabardine slacks Pitts character is posited by Malick to represent unforgiving nature. Grace or spirituality is embodied by his more free-spirited wife who gives love more freely and is luminously portrayed by newcomer Jessica Chastain in a star-making role. ""Thats where God lives"" she says pointing to the sky. Later she is seen floating in the air and reposing in a glass casket Snow White-style. There is a simmering tension between her and Pitt that on a single occasion escalates into a scary physical confrontation. Working with five editors Malick shapes these images just enough to suggest a growing distance between young McCracken and the father a failed musician and increasingly frustrated entrepreneur. Dad clearly favors the doomed middle son (Laramie Eppler) who in turn is taunted by his older brother. The scenes of the boys at play (Tye Sheridan portrays the youngest) are quite magical and for this baby boomer capture the eras innocence perhaps better than any movie I can recollect. Danger lurks everywhere as the youngsters play in an abandoned house and cavort in a cloud of DDT an insecticide that was later banned in this country. Some may feel like theyre being forced to watch somebody elses old home movies albeit the most beautiful ones theyve ever seen (big props to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and production designer Jack Fisk). Im not sure Malick who reportedly drew on his own Texas childhood really needed two hours of these scenes to make his point whatever it may be. Prepare to spend at least 15 minutes or about twice its length speculating afterward about the final sequence in which Penn (who has less than 10 minutes in the entire film) traipses through the desert. Its not exactly a spoiler to report he finds himself wandering with lost souls (including the family of his youth) on a beach. The Rapture? The afterlife? A cathartic breakthrough in Penns psychotherapy? Overreaching by the director? Malick doesnt talk about his movies but Id like to think this former philosophy instructor at MIT would tell you there are no wrong answers. Any movie that so resolutely refuses to explain its mysteries -- it opens with a quote from God to Job and is serious to the point of being humorless -- is obviously not intended for everybody. It also requires a certain tolerance for aphorisms such as ""Unless you love your life will flash by."" For all its flaws ""The Tree of Life"" is a stunning exception to the rule that you can safely check your brain at the popcorn counter until after Labor Day. Thats enough to place it among the years best movies or at least most-talked-about ones. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Oprah finale scores biggest audience in 17 years Read Next Oprah finale scores biggest audience in 17 years Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44530 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21108 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17703 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Joe Neumaier Friday May 27 2011 400 AM Title The Tree of Life With Brad Pitt Sean Penn. A mans youth is seen as a moment in the universes existence. Director Terrence Malick (218). PG-13. At area theaters.What is Terrence Malicks ""The Tree of Life""?Is it an attempt to understand God or a celebration of the planets cycles?Does it say the seeds of our lives were planted by our parents or do we get a free pass thanks to natural instinct?Is it about us before and after we inhabit this universe or a pretentious IMAX movie about the Big Bang?Like so much in this astounding consistently beautiful and challenging movie the answer depends on what you bring to it. Think of it as the Ultimate Anti-Summer-Blockbuster.The winner of this years Palme dOr at Cannes last week writer-director Malicks film seems to be where his previous ones -- ""Badlands"" ""Days of Heaven"" ""The Thin Red Line"" ""The New World"" -- were headed.And it begs other comparisons good and bad.The early light-show of celestial forces forming the galaxy recall ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" (Less charitable viewers may think of ""The Fountain."") It depicts souls leaping into human form or wandering a beachfront afterlife like images from Renaissance art or well the finale of ""Lost.""It quotes the Book of Job and is constantly whispering to God but its casual images of semi-sentient dinosaurs spring from an evolutionary mindset as if the Rev. Billy Graham rewrote ""Jurassic Park.""Whats it about? On the anniversary of his brothers suicide Houston architect Jack OBrien (Sean Penn) recalls his childhood in 1950s Waco Tex. where his gruff but emotional father (a terrific Brad Pitt) was an engineer trying to teach his three sons to be disciplined and exacting.Their angelic mother (Jessica Chastain) had a smile that radiated pure love.The films most enthralling images set to Alexandre Desplats haunting score are of Jacks conception infancy and childhood. As a 12-year-old he and his brothers romp through their tree-lined street as if they owned the world. All the while we hear characters thoughts as well as traditional dialogue.Fear lurks on the edges A stranger is gripped by a seizure chained prisoners walk across main street a neighbor kid has scars from a fire. Is this the natural world intruding on Eden? An implied warning to obey their omniscient father? Or another link to an earlier dinosaur scene in which one meat-eater is kind to another before a meteor wipes them out?Even these tangential people wind up in the adult Jacks afterlife vision. We wonder if they like everything big and small on the planet were placed there deliberately.""The Tree of Life"" is long often redundant and certainly on its own wavelength. But movies so rarely provoke serious consideration and debate. If you find yourself in its sphere your ideas about it will surely differ from everyone elses which is in itself a small miracle.

Fox Searchlight Rootless Sean Penn is the eldest son of a 1950s Texas family struggling with his troubled upbringing in director Terrence Malicks latest film which won the Palme dOr at Cannes. EnlargeClose Fox Searchlight Rootless Sean Penn is the eldest son of a 1950s Texas family struggling with his troubled upbringing in director Terrence Malicks latest film which won the Palme dOr at Cannes. The winner of the Palme dOr the top prize at the Cannes film festival its a contemplative odyssey that taps into the universal need to make sense of memories that flood our consciousness. A shape-shifting film it resembles a poem. At other moments it is closer to a symphony. Most often it approximates a fervent prayer. It is the most ambitious visually arresting and emotionally resonant film from writer-director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven The Thin Red Line). Who else would think to juxtapose the formation of the cosmos with the everyday life of a suburban Texas family in the 1950s? As evidenced by a few vociferous boos at a Cannes screening it is also a divisive film. Some will dismiss its overarching themes and elliptical visuals as pretentious. Others might question its quasi-biblical images. But the artistry in every frame is undeniable. The fractured narrative stars Brad Pitt Sean Penn Jessica Chastain and a terrific sad-eyed young actor Hunter McCracken. Their story explores memory faith grief forgiveness and reconciliation. Mixed in with the achingly human saga are dazzling images of cells multiplying volcanoes erupting and all manner of plant animal and undersea life. At its core The Tree of Life presents a profoundly affecting father-son conflict. Pitt and Chastain play Mr. and Mrs. OBrien the parents of three sons. The oldest Jack is played as an adult by Sean Penn. Penns careworn face speaks volumes as he ponders his turbulent childhood. The Tree of Life     out of four Stars Brad Pitt Jessica Chastain Sean Penn Hunter McCracken Director Terrence Malick Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Rating PG-13 for some thematic material Running time 2 hours 18 minutes Opens Friday in Los Angeles and New York Jacks youth was overseen by an overbearing father and a nurturing mother. Chastain is luminous blending an ethereal quality with a fierce devotion to her sons. Pitts stern father demands respect and loves his children but he terrifies them with his temper. Gorgeous details abound. A yellow butterfly alights on Chastains arm and Malick captures the moment with his own distinctive grace. Minutes into the film Chastains Mrs. OBrien receives the devastating news that one of her sons has died. Her reaction is heartrending as is the more restrained but no less agonized response of Mr. OBrien. Its hard to watch but the pure emotion resonates deeply.

"""The Tree of Life"" Terrence Malicks lofty ambitions fall short in ""Tree of Life"" - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The Tree of LifeWriter-director Terrence Malicks new film takes on some of mankinds biggest quandaries but his opaque distancing filmmaking style makes it difficult for audiences to stay with him.May 26 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Laramie Eppler left Jessica Chastain and Hunter McCracken star in ""The... (Merie Wallace Fox Searchlight )""The Tree of Life"" introduces a character pondering the meaning of existence as he searches for the answers to the universes most perplexing questions. Undeniably impressive its a film that will have viewers posing questions as well just not the ones its director may have intended. For what Terrence Malicks complex extraordinarily ambitious and years-in-the-making new feature unintentionally does is makes people ask what they want out of cinema. Are you looking for serious philosophizing fluid filmmaking and stunning images? Or are satisfying drama and deep emotional connection what draws you in? Ideally you would have both but that is not the case here. ""Tree of Life"" which won the Palme dOr at Cannes turns out to have the defects of its considerable virtues. Written and directed by Malick its a kind of ultimate American art film a prolonged meditation on significant issues that is light on conventional narration and dialogue and heavy on voice-over appeals to a higher power. The story opens with a confrontational quote from the Book of Job (""Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?"") and is frequently punctuated by lines like ""Who are we to you?"" and ""Always you are calling me."" This colloquy has the advantage of being accompanied by a carefully selected largely choral soundtrack (snatches of Bach Couperin Mozart Mahler Smetana Gorecki Respighi Holst and others) and images of extraordinary beauty luminously photographed by the four-time Oscar-nominated cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. ""Tree of Life"" is rife with surpassing visuals whether it be natural phenomena like fiery volcanoes and raging waters or cosmological shots worked on in collaboration with effects supervisor Dan Glass and consultant Douglas Trumbull. But the truth is unless someone tells you that you are watching for instance what is supposed to be the formation of the universe or the day in the distant future when the sun becomes a white dwarf there is no way to know exactly what you are seeing. It is unfortunately characteristic of this meditative and elliptical film that it is simply not possible for rank-and-file viewers to know as much about it as Malick does. Its hard to think of another film made on this scale that is as private and personal as ""Tree of Life"" feels. If this is true of the films astral projections it is equally so when it comes to its dramatic sections. These star Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain as parents to three preteen boys in Waco Texas in the 1950s. The oldest Jack grows up to be an architect (played by Sean Penn) who appears surprisingly briefly and always in the context of struggling with God his parents and the death of his brother R.L. an event that starts the films drama. Even if you dont know that Malick grew up in Texas it is difficult not to watch these sections shot in the Austin suburb of Smithville without feeling that this is in part a memory piece. The filmmaker seems to see and feel things in these images and situations (for instance the shaved back of one brothers head) that we do not. The voice-over that sets the tone for the family story deals with the notion that there are ""two ways through life the way of nature and the way of grace"" the former represented by Jacks father the latter by his mother. ""Nature is willful it only wants to please itself to have its own way."" Grace on the other hand ""is smiling through all things"" believing ""the only way to be happy is to love."" It concludes with a melancholic ""Father mother always you wrestle inside me."" Though it took the production a year of looking at more than 10000 boys before selecting the three non-professionals (Hunter McCracken Laramie Eppler and Tye Sheridan) to play the brothers the heavy lifting in this section is done by Pitt and Chastain. Pitt in one of his most effective performances plays the father as a bull-necked disciplinarian who believes ""it takes fierce will to get ahead in this world."" He is a frustrated aggrieved man who loves his family but sometimes allows his powerful temper to get the best of him. For her part Chastain a lovely and gifted young actress beautifully handles what is an almost wordless portrayal of nurturing love. While ""Tree of Life"" is observational in tone and doesnt have a plot in a conventional sense much of what story it has features the three rambunctious boys especially Jack fighting against their authoritarian dad. Though heartfelt and well-acted a and with impeccable production design by Jack Fisk a this is quite a familiar story (""East of Eden"" comes immediately to mind) and the directors opaque distancing style almost ensures that it will be less involving than it wants to be. Malicks intention is to use style and skill to imbue the ordinary with significance to elevate this small-scale single-family drama by interweaving it with cosmic preoccupations and the older Jacks soul-searching. While Malicks great ability holds us for a time it is finally not enough to compensate for a lack of dramatic involvement a those eschatological quandaries tend to overwhelm the story. ""The Tree of Life"" its enormous advantages notwithstanding ends up a film that demands to be admired but cannot be easily embraced. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Tree of Life MPAA rating PG-13 for some thematic material Running time 2 hours 18 minutes Playing At ArcLight Hollywood; Landmark West Los Angeles MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTerrence Malicks To the Wonder headed to theatersSeptember 28 2012So whats Tree of Life about?

"Howell Tree of Life a masterpiece of wonder dread and hope | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentHowell Tree of Life a masterpiece of wonder dread and hopeTerrence Malicks new film closer to epic poetry than narrative cinema.Brad Pitt signs autographs before a photo call for The Tree of Life at the Cannes Film Festival on Monday May 16 2011.  (Lionel Cironneau / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticMon. May 16 2011CANNES FRANCE--Words inevitably fail any description of The Tree of Life Terrence Malicks masterful new creation that had its world premiere early Monday at the Cannes Film Festival.But try these wonder dread hope. Theyre among the emotions prompted by the cascade of images in something thats closer to epic poetry than to anything resembling narrative cinema.Malicks film only nominally based around a troubled 1950s family headed by Brad Pitt operates at both the micro and macro level.It delves deeply into lifes most basic elements -- earth water fire air -- continuing the filmmakers four-decade fascination with how man connects (or fails to) with the natural world.It also goes further afield in time and space than the Texas filmmaker has ever before dared back to the days of the dinosaurs and forward into the universe beyond the known planets.Article Continued BelowSomehow it all connects but almost entirely on a subliminal level.The Tree of Life is also the most spiritual of Malicks five films so steeped in the adoration -- and questioning -- of unseen deities and celestial realms it risks being misconstrued as didactic dogma.This would be a mistake as it would also be to refer to The Tree of Life as being in opposition to mainstream movie audiences.While it is certainly challenging requiring more than one screening to fully appreciate a film that Malick took years to devise and craft it is intended as an invitation not a rejection.We are summoned to marvel at all that is around us both the things we can perceive and understand and the things we cant.Its a test the film puts directly to our on-screen surrogates the OBrien family of Waco Texas. This struggling post-War brood consists of an angry and disillusioned father (Pitt) a sweet and naive mother (Jessica Chastain) and three rambunctious sons the most difficult and questioning of them being elder lad Jack (Hunter McCracken as a youth Sean Penn as an adult).The OBriens experience happiness and tragedy success and failure hopes and fears. The metaphorical tree of the title refers to the branching paths their lives take as they variously follow either the fathers way of fighting the world or the mothers way of embracing it.Jack is a mixture of both parents of defiance and acceptance and thus a warring creature unto himself. But his difficult journey towards his final destiny is one we all share as do all living creatures from the smallest microbe to the largest thundering mammal.Advance whispers comparing The Tree of Life to Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey prove to be entirely apt. Malicks film has at least two mind-blowing sequences reminiscent of 2001s famous psychedelic ""Stargate"" sequence.Ill have more to say about The Tree of Life closer to its June 10 scheduled theatrical release in Toronto.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Over three decades and just five features director Terrence Malick has crafted grand philosophical symphonies over such epochal events as the Great Depression (Days Of Heaven) World War II (The Thin Red Line) and Americas founding (The New World) but The Tree Of Life feels like the film hes been building toward his entire career. Or maybe its just the film hes been making all along. Without anchoring himself to a larger historical event Malick has made a startlingly direct expression of mans relationship to the natural world and to other forces beyond human comprehension. In terms of scale The Tree Of Life recalls the mammoth ambition of Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey but its also more intimate and personal than Malicks previous films rooted in vivid memories of growing up in 50s Texas. The Tree Of Life starts with a question common to anyone whos lost somebody close to them Why did that have to happen? It then tackles that question by reaching back to the creation itself and pondering the mysteries of God and the universe from The Big Bang to the dinosaurs to the precious wisp of a human life. Working with the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubeski (Children Of Men) Malick spends much of the brilliant first hour assembling exalted images of man and nature with an intuitive poetic style that recalls Wong Kar-wai. He then settles into a fine evocation of one familys life in 50s Waco where a scolding autocratic father (Brad Pitt) and a gently permissive mother (Jessica Chastain) raise three impressionable sons. The simplicity of The Tree Of Life will be mistaken for naivete. Malick works in archetypes not multi-dimensional characters The parents for example are established as diametrical opposites--nature vs. ""grace"" active vs. passive peaceful vs. tempestuous--and the brothers are affected by both ends of the spectrum. Malick extrapolates the competing forces within this family into the tensions of the universe itself and how people choose to negotiate their lives. Though Malick cant top the glorious abstraction of that first hour--the Waco material though full of wonders has a possibly unavoidable shapelessness--The Tree Of Life has a vision that makes most movies look like crude stick drawings. On balance the question of why someone has to die is made to seem absurdly narrow because a single life seems so insignificant in the vastness of time and space. Yet The Tree Of Life isnt despairing about it in the least; its a genuine attempt to grasp the transcendent and the rare religious film that deserves to be called spiritual.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The 12 Must-See Summer Movies -- Plus Five Unheralded Gems and Five More to Skip Lucky for him and us writer-director Terrence Malick follows his own rigorous path. Hitting the box-office sweet spot of trendiness is the last thing on his questing mind. The Tree of Life is only the fifth film that Malick 67 has directed in four decades. But like its predecessors (Badlands Days of Heaven The Thin Red Line and The New World) Tree delivers truths that dont go down easy. No one with a genuine interest in the potential of film would think of missing it. Its a simple story on the surface. Like the Texas-born Malick young Jack OBrien (the remarkable newcomer Hunter McCracken) grows up near Waco in the 1950s. His father - Brad Pitt in a performance of indelible implosive power - raises Jack and younger brothers R.L. (Pitt spitting-image Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan) with a fierce discipline visible even in rare moments of affection. This father is broken by his own sense of underachievement and Pitt subtly lets us feel his pain. For tenderness the boys turn to their mother given a nurturing purity by the radiant Jessica Chastain. Malick views these lives through the prism of the older Jack (Sean Penn doing much with scant screen time) now a Houston architect reeling from a family tragedy the death of one brother. Peter Travers Looks Back on Brad Pitts Career The script has few spoken words relying on visual impressions that connect a single family to nothing less than the creation of the universe scored by Alexandre Desplat with symphonic samplings from Bach Brahms and Mahler. Out of primordial mud and volcanic eruptions life emerges in the form of dinosaurs predators and dawning man. Kubricks 2001 FX master Douglas Trumbull consulted on the effects fitting them organically into the tale. But its cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who links the intimate story to the cosmic one by creating miracles of light and shadow. Heaven and hell brute nature and healing grace all have a place in forging the world as Malick sees it. Sure hes overreaching. Most visionaries do. The Tree of Life dwarfs the big-budget guppies swimming at the multiplex. Drown those suckers. Shot with a poets eye Malicks film is a groundbreaker a personal vision that dares to reach for the stars.

E-mail| Print| Text size - + Gorgeous and ambitious pretentious and baffling tightly controlled yet free-flowing ""The Tree of Life"" is unlike anything youve ever seen before. And yet its very much the culmination of everything Terrence Malick has done until now -- all four features hes made over the past four decades.All his thematic and aesthetic signatures are there from earlier films like ""Badlands"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" the dreamlike yet precise details an obsession with both the metaphysical and the emotional an ability to create suspense within a languid mood.It is simultaneously mesmerizing and maddening as it encompasses nothing less than the nature of existence itself. As writer director Malick ranges far and wide from intimate moments with a growing family in 1950s Texas to the dawn of time -- complete with awesome images of the cosmos and yes those dinosaurs youve surely heard about -- and back again.""The Tree of Life"" is deeply spiritual but Malick isnt one to preach. Instead he gives you the sense that hes genuinely asking questions to which the answers may be unknowable -- hes putting them out there for himself and for us all. Of course well never know his intentions Malick is notoriously elusive which is admirable from an artistic perspective but probably frustrating for those whod like to know what the hell he means by all this.But if youre open to letting the imagery wash over you to allowing yourself to get sucked into the films rhythms and fluidly undulating tones youll be wowed. And even if youre not a spiritual person yourself given to the kind of seeking that frequently marks the characters voiceovers in ""The Tree of Life"" youre unlikely to find the films religious themes alienating.""Lord why? Where were you?"" wonders the mother in the family played as an idealized vision of nurturing womanhood by Jessica Chastain. ""Who are we to you? Answer me.""Malick offers an intriguing contrast between these heavy eternal concepts and prosaic childhood memories light wispy snippets of sight and sound of trees and sky and grass of a mothers voice. (The technical elements here are just stunning including Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography Jack Fisks production design and Alexandre Desplats score). These moments are intentionally impressionistic -- and ""The Tree of Life"" feels defiantly plotless and sometimes self-indulgent -- but they all represent an accurate depiction of how our early recollections can come back to us in fragments. Some are idyllic while others are frightening.Eventually ""The Tree of Life"" becomes rooted in the reality of the OBrien family a father (Brad Pitt) mother (Chastain) and three little boys. Pitt makes the character an intimidating figure a capricious mix of toughness and tenderness and its probably the best work of his career. Chastain a relative newcomer to the screen balances him out with sweetness and grace but also with a playful nature and an open expressive face; you get the sense that she only wants happiness for her children in whatever form it comes to them.But Hunter McCracken the young actor playing Jack the eldest of the three sons has a startlingly confident and commanding presence especially given that this is his first film. McCracken more than holds his own opposite Pitt with whom he repeatedly clashes Hes truly the star. Jack will grow up to be played by Sean Penn a Houston architect whos still shaken by a family tragedy decades later. This is one of the chief weaknesses here Malick has Penn available to him and all he does is ask him to walk around moping in Armani suits.Still ""The Tree of Life"" changed my mood for the rest of the day too -- and when you see a lot of movies most of which tend to flee your memory leaving nary a trace on your heart or mind thats rare. And it cant easily be dismissed.""The Tree of Life"" a Fox Searchlight Pictures release is rated PG-13 for some thematic material. Running time 138 minutes.

Brad Pitt and Laramie Eppler in The Tree of Life (Merie Wallace) B+ The Tree of Life Genre Drama Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Brad Pitt Sean Penn; Director Terrence Malick; Author Terrence Malick; Release Date Limited 05/27/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 138; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Posted June 6 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT The wonder in the end is not that Terrence Malick has taken three years to release his long-awaited fifth feature The Tree of Life. No pilgrims. Given Malicks soaring ambition to create an ecstatic impressionistic epic cinematic tone poem that entwines the stories of one Texas family in the 1950s with nothing less than the creation of the universe the wonder is this How did the famously deliberate contemplative filmmaker finally decide the film was finished? The Tree of Life is both luminously precise (the family part crowned by Brad Pitts commanding performance as a disciplinarian but loving dad) and maddeningly without form and void (the spirituality-lite cosmos part complete with the depiction of the Big Bang and dinosaurs). The latter is padded out with the kind of visual bravado and meditative nature-based photography that Malick devotees adore and the less enthralled see as an awful lot of shots of waving grass and rays of sunlight. I do not mean to dodge Judgment Day when I confess that I fall smack among the agnostic middle awed but also doubting. The heart of the story in any case rests with the OBriens. Father (Pitt) has tamped down personal dreams like other men of his era to become a breadwinner for his wife and three sons. In Malicks cosmology Father represents the hard push of Nature. Celestially ethereal Mother (a lovely Jessica Chastain who barely speaks poor Mom in anything but whispery voice-over) represents Grace. The oldest boy Jack (Hunter McCracken a riveting nonpro kid actor) bears the brunt of his fathers frustrations. Malick Badlands master of temps perdu made tangible captures the infinitesimal ways in which Jack becomes hard himself. Jack becomes so inured that in the movies least successful device he grows up to be played by a dour Sean Penn. Still Malick clings to the promise of grace His vision of the afterlife is a dreamy beach enhanced by an excellent playlist of fine classical music and promising the peace that surpasses all understanding.

You may feel amazed or muddled softly spoken to or simply abandoned while watching it; in any case you shouldnt wait for the DVD. Better than a masterpiece--whatever that is--The Tree of Life is an eruption of a movie something to live with think and talk about afterward. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The film begins with the OBriens (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) receiving news of their teenaged sons death their grief echoing through perplexing shot sequences and sparse dialogue. Its enough to confirm the scuttlebutt that The Tree of Life will be the most unorthodox Hollywood drama in many moons--and then the films perspective switches to the Hubble for a vision of the birth of the universe. From a nebulous ""In the Beginning . . ."" to the first articulations of life on Earth and the reign and extinction of the dinosaurs this silent self-contained sequence was conceived in collaboration with pre-CGI-effects legend Douglas Trumbull fresh out of retirement. The image of a beached plesiosaur craning its neck to contemplate the fatal wound raked across its side lingers on symbol of a wounding and disorienting work. Its the big-budget experimental film George Lucas never had the stones to make.Snap forward to the 1950s the middle-class suburbs of Waco and the OBrien family in an earlier happier moment. Jack (Hunter McCracken) the eldest of three preadolescent brothers emerges as the axis of the film; the process of his education and acculturation to the edge of puberty is documented in a headlong style that lifts sometimes to singing montage. (Usually the crediting of five editors would be reason to panic; Mr. Malicks film has very little truck with whats usual.)Scenes occur as if bobbing on the surface of a familys collective consciousness. Were transported intermittently to a future where the boy Jack has grown up into a crabby Sean Penn daydreaming from a glass rectangle in downtown Houston a contemporary America to make Thomas Jefferson pack it in. In large part the film can be read as occurring in the mind of adult Jack returning to his birthright of memories the indivisible combination of Mom Dad God and backyard.Chastains mother is transparent with virtue the idealized homefront sweetheart dreamed in Malicks The Thin Red Line but now stretched gauzy over feature length. A less worshipfully written part gives Pitt more to do. Though more affectionate than our image of the flat-top Eisenhower-era patriarch Mr. OBrien badgers his sons with lessons in Looking Out For No. 1 and backyard boxing. Venting a bellyful of frustrated ambition he talks covetously about the folks on the hill brags about his worthless patents and finds an outlet for unrealized musical aspirations by playing the church organ. This provides some of the classical music that fills Tree of Life much of it liturgical fitting Jacks growing paralleled disillusion with his father and the Father ""Why should I be good if you arent?"" hes asking both.Though markedly faithful to Darwin Malicks film begins with a quotation from the Book of Job imagines heaven and features Mother pointing to the sky to deliver the lesson ""God lives there."" Like anything ambitious Tree of Life will be called ""pretentious"" but its characters address the gauche subject of the eternal naturally through the Judeo-Christian lingua franca instead of via a vague enervated ""spirituality."" In this it is quite direct and accessible.With his cosmic realism Malick vividly remembers youths intimate yet huge idea of God and Tree of Lifes Genesis overture recalls a childs awed first conception of the vastness beyond his proscribed world. Thus prepared you have fresh eyes to see suburbia as yes a miracle. The close touch of DP Emmanuel Lubezkis Steadicam brings childhood rites near roughhousing betrayals of confidence the clandestine thrill of being alone in a strange house a childs frank curiosity toward town drunks cripples and the black boys at that BBQ.In his evocation of lost-Eden childhood Malick shows the wisdom of C.S. Lewiss An Experiment in Criticism ""If we are to use the words childish and infantile as terms of disapproval we must make sure that they refer only to those characteristics of childhood which we become better and happier by outgrowing"" Lewis wrote. ""Who in his sense would not keep if he could that tireless curiosity that intensity of imagination that facility of suspending disbelief that unspoiled appetite that readiness to wonder to pity and to admire?"" It is because the 67-year-old director can get so much of that onscreen and much more besides that hes one of the few American filmmakers operating on the multiplex scale who makes movies feel like undiscovered country.1 Thats Life Brad Pitt emerges.Merie Wallace and 2011 Twentieth Century Fox Film Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

By Anthony Lane Jessica Chastain Laramie Eppler Brad Pitt and Tye Sheridan in the fifth feature film to be directed by Malick.   Credit Photograph by MERIE WALLACE If you wait long enough a new Terrence Malick film comes around. ""The Tree of Life"" Malicks latest is his fifth feature in thirty-eight years. His nearest rival in the slow-burner stakes is Thomas Pynchon whose first five novels took thirty-four years to appear. Both men have fallen victim to our prejudice. We simply cannot believe that a creative artist might out of respectable diffidence fight shy of fame. We therefore assume that a man like Malick is playing a devilish game of anti-publicity in order to stoke our curiosity; no less perilous however is our assumption that merely because a movie or a novel was pondered and kept secret for a lengthy period it must tower above its more precipitate peers. Not so. Dont forget Edgar G. Ulmers coruscating ""Detour"" (1945) which was shot in six days. The most startling thing in ""The Tree of Life"" is the sight of Sean Penn waking up and going to work in a skyscraper. Nothing rum about that but if my calculations are correct Penns character Jack is the first person in any Malick movie to be living in the present day. ""Badlands"" (1973) is set in the nineteen-fifties; ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) unfolds in the early twentieth century showing soldiers heading off to the First World War; ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998) takes place before and during the Battle of Guadalcanal; and ""The New World"" (2005) summons us to the age of Pocahontas. It is no sin to veer away from your own time--indeed to stick doggedly to it can smack of historical vanity--but the suspicion lingers that Malick finds something distasteful in our current mores. Jack is employed in architecture or design (we see him browsing briefly through plans); more than that we cannot say because the dialogue is either mumbled or faded out and what draws Malicks gaze is not the grind of an office meeting but Jacks downcast glances out of high windows and the flashes of transcendence that are vouchsafed by patterns of glass and steel. Michael Mann you could argue is no less obsessed with the physical spaces that we inhabit yet to experience ""The Tree of Life"" is less like watching a Mann movie than like reading Emersons ""The Over-Soul."" Before long Malick retreats into the past--to be specific into the Texas of the nineteen-fifties. The film was shot largely in the town of Smithville although we see a truck with the words ""City of Waco"" on its side. That is almost the only traffic; children play unthreatened on tranquil streets under skies of perpetual balm. Among the kids is Jack (now played by the excellent Hunter McCracken) a boy growing up with his younger brothers R.L. (Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan) under the wing of their parents Mr. OBrien (Brad Pitt) and his wife (Jessica Chastain). Neither of the parents earns a first name and like many of Malicks dramatis personae they feel at once solid and ungraspable. The mother with her Pre-Raphaelite copper hair is little short of an angel--at one point she dances on air like Winona Ryder at the end of ""Beetlejuice""--and somehow though the OBriens are not well off she never wears the same dress twice. The father works at a local factory but Malick chooses again not to bother us with details. Of more concern to him is what OBrien could have done he plays the piano at home and the organ in church and he puts on Brahmss Fourth Symphony during supper. We are left with a sorrowful sense of wrong turnings taken never to be retraced. Sorrow issues in wrath and ""The Tree of Life"" wakes up as we realize that OBrien is venting his frustrations on the family. To begin with severity and affection intertwine ""Do you love your father?"" he asks Jack. ""Yes sir"" the boy replies. But tempers are lost offenders are shut in closets for daring to talk back and we get a frightening scene in which the sons are taught or commanded to swing a punch at the patriarch. ""Hit me"" OBrien says baring his jaw. That for once is the most salient feature of Pitts anatomy. We have grown so fond of his doleful eyes and the wide crack of his grin that its quite something to find the actor leading with his chin jutting it stubbornly toward a world that has fallen short of his great expectations. Add the heaviness of his tread and the thick rims of his spectacles and you get his manliest performance to date with the last flickers of pretty boy snuffed out. When the father goes away on a long trip the boys relax into near-Oedipal bliss tended by a mother whose principles as she intones them are almost comically drained of sternness ""Love everyone. Love every leaf every ray of light."" Not that there is any comedy here and Nabokovs knowing remark that only one letter divides the comic from the cosmic would touch no chord in Malick. Instead he conjures a singular blend of the prim and the pantheistic and ""The Tree of Life"" remains not just a joke-free zone but nervous of bodies that misbehave. No sex intrudes although there is an extraordinary sequence in which the first promise of sex flushes Jacks brow like a fever as he raids a neighbors bedroom and rifles through her lingerie. Yet even here when he holds her nightgown up to the light like a celestial robe then steals it and floats it downriver you want to bow to the beauty of the images and at the same time to take the director aside and say ""Terry I hate to break it to you but thats not all that pubescent boys like to do."" This seraphic strain is present even in ""Badlands"" Malicks first--and still by some distance his best--feature film in which a youthful tearaway (Martin Sheen) doesnt hesitate to shoot men in the back yet remains erotically aloof even though his girlfriend (Sissy Spacek) is with him on the lam. We see her buttoning her dress but thats it and the whole tale is bent upon the flatlining of desires; we hear it in her unperturbed voice-overs which established a tradition that has swelled with every Malick film and that now hits a solipsistic high. Almost all the folks in ""The Tree of Life"" devote more time to murmurs cries and whispers confided to us from the prison of their own heads than to conversing with their fellow-humans and while the result will sound to some like a prayer others may find it increasingly lonely and locked and may themselves pray for Ben Hecht or Billy Wilder to rise from the dead and attack Malicks script with a quiver of poisonous wisecracks. ""Brother"" and ""Mother"" are the first things that we hear followed not long after by a plea ""What are we to you?"" This is uttered by the mother although it could equally have come from the lips of Job (who is quoted in the films epigraph) or a lamenting Jeremiah. The question is addressed not to the audience but--it is safe to say--to God. We then get his considered reply and this is the branch of ""The Tree of Life"" that sticks out. We see glimmers of unfathomable light vast interstellar conflagrations drifting throngs of stars planets in their formless infancy sun and moon occluded by dark storms energizing jolts of lightning gulping primordial pools early plants early creatures slow-dancing jellyfish hammerhead sharks a dinosaur lounging on the shore an embryos eye and last but not least a child being born--to a white-clad mother who neither sweats nor shouts--in postwar suburban Texas. Now you can call this entire passage overblown or diversionary but what it is not is incoherent or mad. It strikes me as a straightforward account of creation Malicks Genesis ending in the Eden of Jacks childhood; everything else in the film dramatizes the loss of that prelapsarian grace and the rare Proustian instants at which it is remembered afresh. ""If we cannot educate ourselves to his purposes then clearly his work will look like nonsense."" That is Malick writing of Heidegger and introducing his own translation of Heideggers ""The Essence of Reasons"" in 1969. He refers to the philosophers ""peculiar language"" and ""The Tree of Life"" is no less odd yet its purposes are clear it is a grief-powered movie triggered by the revelation near the start that Jacks brother R.L. died at the age of nineteen. The complaint that is floated if never spoken by the OBriens in their loss as by any mourner is ""Why forge everything from the big bang onward if its all going to conclude with this--the far greater cataclysm to me of a loved ones dying? What O Lord was the point?"" (There are reports unconfirmed by Malick that his brother committed suicide in the nineteen-sixties.) So does the film burst the bounds of that emotion? Is it just too much? It certainly doesnt know how to end; after two hours I could have done without Sean Penn dressed in Armani kneeling on a beach while the other characters mooch around like unwanted extras from ""Zabriskie Point."" Afflatus has an unhappy habit as Malick has proved before of subsiding into a monotone. Tucked away inside the grandeur though and enlivened by jump cuts is a sharp not unharrowing story of a father and son and amid ones exasperation there is no mistaking Malicks unfailing ability to grab at glories on the fly. When news of R.L.s death arrives the world reels and capsizes yet even then we see the shadows of children--capering upside down on the sunlit asphalt like ghosts of what should have been.

Another profoundly inspired and visually scrumptious multi-year production from the reclusive filmmaker Malicks fifth feature in a career that spans three decades contains his most audacious treatment of the themes percolating throughout his works. ""Tree of Life"" represents the greatest expression of heady Malickian concepts which usually involve humanity adrift in the chaos of the universe and the meaning of everything (or lack thereof). In this situation he removes excess story and assembles a sweeping visual poem. ""Tree of Life"" has characters but unlike the rest of the Malick canon barely the hint of a plot. The very fact that Malick can get away with such a highly experimental and inherently non-commercial effort while still casting two of the most recognizable movie stars in the world -- Brad Pitt and Sean Penn the latter of whom appears in only a handful of scenes -- deserves admiration. ""Tree of Life"" benefits from a working knowledge of Malicks affinity for overt metaphorical imagery pensive voiceovers and stirring renditions of natural beauty. Few other filmmakers can work on this scale without some compromises but Malick manages to deviate from his cross-generational family drama with cosmically endowed CGI visuals recounting the beginning and end of time. The movies very existence means he got away with it even if audiences expecting something familiar throw up their hands. Others (myself included) will find Malicks spectacular vision as mesmerizing and provocative as he undoubtedly intends. Relentlessly batty and quixotic ""Tree of Life"" is sometimes weighed down by its eccentricities but not enough to ruin its appeal. The gist of the movie involves two eras. The setting is Waco-the Texas city where Malick was born. In the 1950s a suburban couple (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) learn that middle child has died under mysterious circumstances. The innocent older son (Hunter McKracken) witnesses his parents grief with extreme mystification and grows up in a household informed by his awareness of a less than perfect harmony to the world. Decades later the boy has grown up and become an architect played by Sean Penn whose entire screen time amounts to under 10 minutes. (Malick somehow manages to relegate big faces to small roles ""The Thin Red Line"" included about 30 seconds of George Clooney.) The chosen profession of Penns character reflects his need to put pieces together and construct a working knowledge of reality despite its elusiveness as Malick portrays it. As an adult Penn struggles to make peace with his tattered family life particularly the estranged relationship he maintained with his demanding father following his brothers death. But the source of his frustration ventures far beyond that fundamental psychological hang-up. Malicks focus on fleeting conversations and memories rather than standard narrative arcs draws out his characters symbolic dimension. From start to finish ""Tree of Life"" grapples with the prospects of surviving and suffering on a Biblical level although its religious traits are non-denominational. Malick begins with a quote from Job but quickly launches into a much-anticipated flashback to the Big Bang and Earths explosive origins including masterfully rendered shots of a primordial sea colorful cell birth and yes a couple of soul-searching dinosaurs. (All of this suggests ideal viewing conditions in IMAX.) Malicks adorable horn-billed critters have less screen time than Penn but theyve been considered the movies biggest stars since rumors about their appearance made the rounds on the web. Despite not being best rendition of the species this side of ""Jurassic Park"" their synthetic appearance underscores the wonderful oddity of the entire tangent which also includes luscious space imagery supposedly guided to completion by a team of NASA scientists. Its a beguiling deviation that calls to mind the sensational climax to ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" but Malicks use of science fiction components exclusively exist in the abstract. The actors are never overshadowed by the special effects; in fact Malick uses the cast in a manner similar to the way he travels through time. Pitt looks more focused than any of his recent roles and Chastain (who portrays another troubled housewife in the similarly otherworldly ""Take Shelter"" also playing at Cannes) delivers her constant mopey expression with a necessary degree of understatement. Between the two of them their observant child witnesses dual approaches to seeing the world. His father tells him to ""Have control over your destiny"" and teaches him to fight back against bullies while his mother gives him gentler treatment. None of this has a linear design. ""Tree of Life"" progresses with an unending parade of visuals captured in a complex palette by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki the only person involved with Malicks under-appreciated ""The New World"" to receive an Oscar nomination. If Lubezki treats his job like a painter Malick uses his magic to make the artwork come to life. Whoever cut the trailer for ""Tree of Life"" not only nailed the look of the movie; they also perfectly encapsulated the experience of watching it. Thats not to say that ""Tree of Life"" lacks a dramatic edge. Presumably taking his fathers advice that ""the world lives by trickery"" so ""in order to succeed you cant be too good"" the child starts to act out. In one scene he ties a frog to fireworks and blows it to bits and gives into peer pressure from other neighborhood kids to throw a rock through a window. Eventually he begins to resent his fathers tough parenting ""Please god kill him"" he implores in voiceover only to have second thoughts when dad wakes up to the world. In short his father becomes the literal embodiment of the environmental consciousness seen in every Malick movie reveling in ""the glory around us... trees birds. I dishonored it all and didnt notice the glory."" Perhaps in response ""Tree of Life"" displays that glory in virtually every shot. Malick briefly returns to CGI with the movies curious ending which includes a concise vision of Earths demise and unexplained shots of lost souls wandering across a sun-soaked beach. His final shot takes us back to civilization with a renewed perspective but no easy answers. ""Tree of Life"" is not an enigma that begs to be solved. In fact Malick defies the need for any explanations early on In a passing conversation Pitt tells his son the meaning of the word ""subjectivity"" which may also constitute Malicks address to the audience. Its as though he were saying Make of this what you will. Or dont. HOW WILL IT PLAY? At the end of the movies first press screening at Cannes loud booing could be heard throughout the Palais but just as many people responded with cheers. This much is clear Critics will be divided. But the movies lush appearance and star power should provide enough ammo for the savvy marketing team at Fox Searchlight to turn it into a hit. criticWIRE grade A- This Article is related to Festivals and tagged Cannes Film Festival Reviews The Tree of Life-2 More From IndieWireBoJack Horseman Brilliantly Argues Why Comedy Belongs in the Abortion DebateReview Vice Principals Charms With A-Grade Class Clowns But This VP Is No VeepReview Stranger Things is Still Waiting for Something New To Make It Feel AliveAquarius Trailer Sonia Braga Stars As a Widow Fighting To Remain In Her Apartment In Brazilian Cannes Drama Comments I May 12 2016 504 pm http//twitter.com/treeoflifefilm Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review 2011 A Directors Odyssey Terrence Malicks overblown goofy slightly ridiculous The Tree of Life should be seen immediately. By David Edelstein Published May 20 2011 ShareThis Jessica Chastain Tye Sheridan and Brad Pitt in The Tree of Life.  (Photo Merie Wallace/Courtesy of 20th Century Fox) In his fifth feature The Tree of Life the visionary director Terrence Malick uses every cinematic tool under heaven to trace the connections between the fleeting and the infiniteand if that sounds fancy then Lord you aint heard nothing yet. This is Malicks big one his long-gestating answer to 2001 and Paradise Lost and its wedded to his (maybe) autobiographical Oedipal family drama of life in the fifties in Texas under a brutish but increasingly impotent father (Brad Pitt) and a diaphanously beautiful mother (Jessica Chastain) who embodies the spirit of Grace. Im not reading into it She ruminates in voice-over on the way of Grace versus the way of Nature which will make things a lot easier for students writing papers. There is the suggestion of a narrative The protagonist is a boy Jack OBrien (Hunter McCracken) of increasingly wayward emotions who adores his mom and wishes aloud for his dad to die. But its better to think of The Tree of Life as a Transcendentalist church pageant in which the players whisper questions to the Almighty after the death of a son and brother (Where were You? How did I lose You?)followed by nothing less than the birth of the universe the beginning of cellular life some dinosaurs and then children swimming into the Garden of Eden that is Waco. And its all filtered through the memory of Jack as a grown-up (Sean Penn) seen both in a glass-and-steel metropolis and on the rocky vaguely primordial beach that represents his inner world. After warming up with The Thin Red Line and The New World Malick has succeeded in fully creating his own film syntax his own temporal reality and lo it is kind of goofy. But riveting. Malicks vantageand that of his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezkiis the oddest combination of the archetypal and the impressionistic with a lot of trailing after the characters and then hovering. Pitt who co-produced the film and had to speak for Malick when the director blew off a Cannes press conference put it well Malick is like a guy with a big butterfly net waiting for a moment of truth to go by. And those disconnected moments are woven together to make the film amazingly fluid. (There are five count em credited editors.) See Also Terrence Malicks Thirty-Three Years of Principal Filming  The Tree of Life Debuts at Cannes to Boos and Swoons Malick is often likened to Stanley Kubrick who meticulously composed his shots and often needed scores of takes to get exactly what he wanted. (He drove actors crazy.) If anything Malick is the anti-Kubrick. To help him design the long section in which the universe the Earth and life begin Malick turned to Douglas Trumbull best known for 2001 but this time the effects have spiritual depth. Trumbull has spoken of Malick hunting for the Tao those magical unexpected moments that no one could possibly design. But wait arent they designed? Some of them are closely inspired by the latest science. Most however are freaky. What is that image that launches each of the films sections? It appears to be the cosmos in its infancy yet the shape is angelic with an opening that could well be meant as a portal to heaven. Then come the undersea shots coil-like life forms blobby jellyfish hammerhead sharks Jar Jar Binks. Well hes not as repulsive as Jar Jar but hes somewhat anthropomorphized. Where Kubricks first section of 2001 built to a scene of an early human finding a tool with which to kill Malick shows a predatory dinosaur stopping himself from stomping a fallen dino to death. Its the first stirring of compassion. For a personal director though Malick can be curiously impersonal. No image is allowed to be non-archetypal. Low-angle shots of boys climbing a tree heavenward Thats a recurrent motif. So is water symbolizing birth and death. (The movie feels as if it were processed in amniotic fluid.) Chastain is a willowy redhead with bright eyes and skin so fair that you feel as if youre seeing into her soul. Her 2008 performance in Jolene was revelatoryshe has the potential to be a major actressand yet Malick turns her into an object the sort of ethereal creature on whom butterflies land. She and the other actors spend a lot of screen time tottering among trees looking bereft while the soundtrack serves up too many familiar chestnuts Brahms Smetana Mahler Holst and the de rigueur Ligeti in the mode of 2001. As the boy Jack McCracken is terrificmeaning good and terrifyingwith stuck-out ears that are perfect for a patriarch to twist and as the characters hormones kick in a hint of something wilder and more sexually violent. The Fall approaches. A boy drowns at a public beach another is badly burned and pretty soon Jack starts to play with BB guns. He and his buddies blow up a nest of eggs. (Why should I be good if You arent? he asks in voice-over.) Reptiles appear. Then Jack begins to gaze longingly at his ripely erotic mother and angrily at his square-jawed father. (Pitt plays the dad with the right mix of paternalism and emotional detachment.) Theres a dash of homoeroticism in a scene between Jack and the blond brother who we know is destined to die in his teens. (In a war? Its never clear.) Its tantalizing stuff suggesting the psychosexual underpinnings of all those Malick versions of heaven and hell. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Its also visually stunning Malick remains atop the field conceiving and executing shots with genius-level precision. So what keeps the door barred on the ""modern masterpiece"" label? The lack of cohesion and the failure to connect. As such Tree of Life is a flawed though intensely interesting experience at the theater. This could be a parable portraying The Garden of Eden innocence lost the Book of Job or possibly even a creation metaphor. It could be anything or it could be nothing and thats where the clarity issue must be considered. Early on in Tree of Life the basic framework for the piece is established. Its nature vs. grace conflict vs. cooperation creation vs. destruction. Tree of Life asks all the big questions which means it really only asks one question over and over. Why? Why do we die? Why are we here? Why should we be good to each other? Why do parents lie? The questions come furiously generally presented in minute-long vignettes and Tree of Life at times feels like about 150 majestic postcards in a row. Some are spoken word some feature voiceover and some show off incredible imagery. Theres a twenty minute portion of Tree of Life where Malick simply breaks down all of creation from the beginning of time including the dinosaurs and the ""ecosystem killing"" meteor. And yes Malick still adores his shots of roiling water fully realized soft blue chaos. These are not shots that your average director could pull off with such style and the ambition of Tree of Life is sweeping and robust. The main characters of Tree of Life are a family living in Waco Texas. Mr. OBrien (Brad Pitt) and his wife (Jessica Chastain) have three young sons. They also have parenting styles which are reflective of the central themes. Mrs. OBrien is all harmony and grace. She believes in loving everything shes willing to take abuse she wants to please. Mr. OBrien is nature survival of the fittest. He believes in never quitting seeks to please himself and he wants to dole out abuse. They each educate and raise the children in their manner and neither is completely effective. Tree of Life strives to point out that balance of force is required but that nothing can truly insulate you from the hard lessons of life. Simply loving without discipline doesnt get you anywhere nor does working tirelessly without passion. The kids are strands of each of these arguments. The older one is just like his father a scrapper while the younger boy is sweetness and light the spitting image of his mother. The third son represents a flaw with the film as hes not well established. However the conundrum of this complaint is that this might very well be a stylistic choice given the events that transpire. We simply cant know what we dont know which of course Malick is fully aware of. The OBriens for all their faith and coping techniques keep sliding inch by inch degree by degree toward the brink and a crisis of faith. The children are followed from birth to early teens first being taught objective concepts here is how you read here is how you you kiss before the parents make the transition to subjective human frameworks like boundaries respect and fear items that only exist as a shared human consciousness. The children are versed in the world but they start to see the hypocrisy they start to question parental authority they start to question how God works. Tree of Life is filled with some truly lovely discussion points all based on that ""why"" paradigm. Why does God send flies to wounds he should heal? Why must we keep trying? Misfortune befalls the good as well as the wicked and as the children mature they certainly lose their innocence. Near this juncture the film plays as completely stunning ... and massively quixotic. The other main character is an adult version of one of the OBrien children. Sean Penn tackles this part but its fairly disjointed and difficult to follow. Penns portion does occur in modern day so we do get Malicks sweeping architectural vistas and impressive use of light. The modern scenes do lend a certain relevance to the proceedings but they take just as much off the table in terms of emotional resonance. Again its hard to sit in judgment of the human experience laid bare in such an intimate manner and Malicks ambition must be hailed even as his concepts separate him from the herd. Tree of Life is a riddle. Captivating at times ponderous at others it is clear were in the hands of a master though its just as clear he doesnt plan on giving you all the answers. In that Tree of Life is really the story of human existence it cant help but be a little flawed.

Its a thought Ive had many times before but only when revisiting old favorites or having my first belated look at a decades-old classic. No matter how obviously magnificent a contemporary film may be Im not generally prepared to reserve a place for it in the canon before its even halfway over--indeed it often takes me two or three complete viewings before I finally make the leap from ""just plain great"" to ""all-time masterpiece."" Im slow that way. Roughly an hour into Terrence Malicks mindbending The Tree of Life however I was fully convinced I was bearing world-premiere witness to the equivalent of Birth Of A Nation or Citizen Kane or 2001 A Space Odyssey--an instant benchmark against which the entire medium would henceforth be measured. Advance word suggesting that this 50s-set small-town family drama would somehow involve dinosaurs proved to be wholly inadequate preparation for the cosmic scale of Malicks ambition. The big talking point for most will undoubtedly be the films awe-inspiring second ""movement"" (symphonic analogies are unavoidable here) which condenses the first 13.74 billion years of the universe into a roiling montage of purposeful chaos. But even when Malick returns to Waco Texas where a domineering Dad (Brad Pitt) and angelic Mom (Jessica Chastain) raise three rambunctious boys The Tree of Life remains for a time thrillingly impressionistic eschewing any semblance of conventional narrative in favor of a fragmentary approach in which glancing allusive snippets of light breath and motion bum-rush the camera lens accompanied by plaintive whispered voiceover narration implicitly addressed to God. (I found those whispers off-putting in The Thin Red Line and The New World but they work beautifully here perhaps because they dont serve as counterpoint to something as iconic as WWII or the Pocahontas story.) Call it We Need to Talk About Existence. Like Lynne Ramsay however Malick cant maintain that level of poetic abstraction forever. (Actually I believe they both could have but neither apparently wanted to.) After bopping freely across time and space for over an hour The Tree of Life finally settles down and starts telling something like a straightforward story as the couples eldest son Jack (Hunter McCracken) repeatedly squares off against Pitts crew-cut martinet. (At various points though not in this lengthy section we also see Jack as a world-weary adult played by Sean Penn.) Given what we know about Malick--born and raised in Waco with a brother who died young (as one of Jacks brothers apparently does though that occurs during the impressionistic blitz)--this material is likely autobiographical and its certainly deeply felt; many individual moments of random beauty and violence still stand out. But the longer the film goes on and the more its figures solidify into actual characters the less magical it seems until eventually it resembles a solid but largely unexceptional memoir not unlike say This Boys Life. (Remember that one? With De Niro and DiCaprio in the Pitt and McCracken roles?) Maybe that first hour raised my expectations so high that no second hour-plus could possibly fulfill them but my gut feeling is that Malick got distracted from his overall conception by a desire to revisit specific incidents from his childhood by the need to depict his father rather than simply a father. And the films denouement which attempts to circle back to transcendence felt disappointingly banal even a bit drippy. The Tree of Life is a major achievement and Id be perfectly happy to see it win the Palme dOr (its my personal vote as of this writing since Martha Marcy May Marlene and Miss Bala arent in Competition) but the space Id cleared for it in my list of the five or ten greatest movies ever made remains empty. Wholly Inadequate Grade B (but I can readily imagine it graduating to a B+ on second viewing). Not to be outdone by some reclusive American French provocateur Bruno Dumont who always juxtaposes the sacred and the profane does so yet again in his latest effort which bears the clumsy English-language title Outside Satan. (For some reason its in Un Certain Regard even though Dumont is a Competition veteran and this film is no less accomplished or ambitious than his others.) Ive never been a particular fan of Dumonts bizarre sensibility which seems to argue that nothing is truly spiritual unless its ugly damaged or depraved but hed seemed to turn a corner of some kind with his excellent previous film Hadewijch even casting an actor (Julie Sokolowski) capable of giving a performance rather than merely embodying a physiognomy. Alas hes reverted to form. Outside Satan follows two inexpressive lumps (David Dewaele and Alexandra Lematre) around northern France as they alternately commit acts of violence and kneel in silent prayer; the unnamed man who seems to be homeless also repeatedly visits the home of a young girl whose unspecified affliction hes able to cure via what looks like mouth-to-mouth exorcism. (Later a backpacker who propositions him--in typical Dumont fashion the actual line is ""You can fuck me if you like""--gets rather more than she bargained for when they go at it in a way that perhaps explains why he keeps rebuffing the other girls advances.) Its not terribly hard to fashion a religious allegory from the surreal elements of this film but it isnt especially rewarding either given how pointedly unpleasant and flatly declarative its surface forever remains. If you dug Life of Jesus Humaniteand Flanders however I can all but guarantee itll be right up your alley. Grade C With the possible exception of ""pretentious"" no adjective is of less critical use than ""boring"" but holy crap was I bored out of my skull by Andre Techines Unforgivable screening in the Directors Fortnight. So much so in fact that I dont have a whole lot to say about it other than avoid. Andre Dussollier (Wild Grass) plays a writer who moves to Venice to work on his new novel and instantly proposes to the real-estate broker (Carole Bouquet) who finds a house for him. That she instantly accepts despite having no apparent feelings for him one way or the other is typical of this meandering painfully mundane character study; as in so many literary adaptations (the source is a novel by Philippe Djian) things that may have made sense when we were privy to the characters inner monologues become opaque when were restricted to observing their actions. A daughter (Melanie Thierry) goes missing a son (Mauro Conte) is released from jail a retired private detective (Adriana Asti) starts snooping about -- theres incident a-plenty but its all just so much stuff that happens devoid of either entertainment or meaning. I can forgive Techine without difficulty -- you make Wild Reeds you get a lifetime pass -- but his heart doesnt seem to have really been in this one. Grade C Tomorrow Aki Kaurismaki returns after a five-year absence and 2007 Grand Prix winner Naomi Kawase (The Mourning Forest) takes another shot at the Palme.

Few American filmmakers are as alive to the splendor of the natural world as Terrence Malick but even by his standards ""The Tree of Life"" represents something extraordinary. The iconoclastic directors long-awaited fifth feature is in many ways his simplest yet most challenging work a transfixing odyssey through time and memory that melds a young boys 1950s upbringing with a magisterial rumination on the Earths origins. Result is pure-grade art cinema destined primarily for the delectation of Malick partisans and adventurous arthouse-goers but with its cast names and see-it-to-believe-it stature this inescapably divisive picture could captivate the zeitgeist for a spell. A magnum opus thats been kicking around inside Malicks head for decades and awaited by his fans for almost as long the film will certainly invite even-more-vociferous-than-usual charges of pretension and overambition criticisms that are admittedly not entirely without merit here. Taking the directors elusive elliptical style perhaps as far as it will go ""The Tree of Life"" is nothing less than a hymn to the glory of creation an exploratory often mystifying 138-minute tone poem that will test any Malick non-fans patience for whispery voiceover and flights of lyrical abstraction. Critical response will be passionately split (judging by the noisy mixture of boos and applause at the Cannes press screening) even among those who share Malicks poetic orientation and appreciate his willingness to place A-list stars and visual effects in service of unapologetically spiritual and philosophical concerns. Still others may find the picture underwhelming in light of its epic journey to the screen -- a troubled six-year gestation period replete with casting woes and editing delays; the shuttering of U.S. distributor Apparition before Fox Searchlight swooped in; and a last-minute tussle over whether its U.K. release date would trump its world premiere in competition at Cannes. And so its only fitting that ""The Tree of Life"" should demand a measure of patience. The same could of course be said of Malicks four other features all veiled parables of mans fall from grace and the corruption of an irretrievable innocence. With his new film Malick has essentially parted the veil. He has abandoned the oblique historical narratives of his previous two pictures ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""The New World"" to tell an intimate wisp of a story that allows him to address his cosmic concerns in the most direct least compromised manner possible. Yet far from feeling slight the film surprisingly emerges as Malicks most emotionally accessible work since 1978s ""Days of Heaven"" so primal and recognizable are the childlike perceptions and feelings he puts onscreen. An opening quotation from the book of Job (""Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?"") lays the celestial groundwork as the film eases the viewer into the preadolescence of Jack OBrien (Hunter McCracken) the eldest of three boys in midcentury small-town Texas. The first of numerous narrators speaks of two possible paths through life the way of nature embodied by the boys stern taskmaster of a father (Brad Pitt) and the way of grace represented by their sweet nurturing mother (Jessica Chastain). The early reels convey the arc of Jacks life as a series of subjective impressions leaping ahead to the pivotal moment when Mr. and Mrs. OBrien receive word that one of Jacks brothers has died at age 19 an occurrence that is neither lingered on nor really explained. Before long Jack is a grown man (a weary-looking Sean Penn) seen roaming the executive offices of a Houston high-rise and speaking on the phone with his father who has clearly not mellowed with age. Emmanuel Lubezkis continually mobile camera occasionally using wide-angle lenses prowls through these early scenes as though observing them from a side angle; the visual restlessness mirrors Jacks own inner turmoil echoed by the inchoate voices we hear in his head. Time and space themselves seem to destabilize and the film as though unable to abide the present any longer retreats into the ancient past. Its at this point roughly 20 minutes in that ""The Tree of Life"" undergoes arguably the most extreme temporal shift in the history of cinema. Comparisons to ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" are perhaps intended not least because Stanley Kubricks special-effects creator Douglas Trumbull served as a visual consultant on Malicks eye-candy evocation of the dawn of time (conceived by several visual-effects houses but designed with minimal reliance on CGI). We observe a flurry of awe-inspiring images at astronomical biological macro- and microscopic levels a nebula expanding in outer space; cells multiplying in a frenzy; a school of shimmering jellyfish; darkness illuminated by a volcanic eruption; a bubbling primordial ooze. Viewers may not always be sure of what theyre looking at during this sequence but thats no hindrance to appreciating the sublime imagery or the rhapsodic force of the accompanying choral and orchestral tracks. Yet the director isnt inclined to linger not even on the stunning occasional glimpse of dinosaurs whose presence on Earth is observed as matter-of-factly as the cataclysm that brings their chapter to a close. Texas suburbia comes back into focus and the film devotes its remaining 100 or so minutes to a sensitive portrait of Jacks upbringing rendered here as a sort of symphony with many movements often set to Alexandre Desplats sometimes majestic sometimes ominous score. As raggedly structured as this portion of the film is (five editors handled the disjunctive yet intuitive cutting) Malick couldnt be more attuned to the personal joys sorrows and insecurities of this boys life and his tactile images seem suffused with a Norman Rockwell-esque nostalgia even as they seek to deconstruct it. From the tension that sets in whenever Jacks father appears to the boys exhilarating sense of freedom as they run through DDT clouds billowing from a spray rig scene after scene brims with intimate tenderly observed details while the rural locations enable the helmers signature shots of rustling grass and water-reflected sunlight abetted by richly textured sound design. The camera whips through the familys Craftsman-style house (lovingly appointed by Malicks longtime production designer Jack Fisk) until it comes to seem like home. The link between Jacks story and the films prehistoric reverie is never made explicit though its essential meaning could scarcely be plainer or more deeply felt. The rare film to urgently question yet also accept the presence of God in a fallen world ""Tree of Life"" understands that every childhood is a creation story unto itself and just as a new planet is formed by the elements so an emerging soul is irrevocably shaped by the forces that nurture it. No one exerts a more domineering influence in Jacks life or on the film itself than his father. Played with iron-jawed intensity by Pitt Mr. OBrien is the very picture of intimidation -- a strict upright disciplinarian who though not immune to affection is not above using hugs and kisses as instruments of control. One moment in which Jack considers a retaliatory act of violence is both amusing and shockingly blunt. And yet Malick extends the father the same compassion he grants the mother played with heartrending vulnerability by Chastain as a woman who strives to protect defend and console her children at all times. Young McCracken makes an outstanding screen debut his eyes seeming to reflect a sad wisdom beyond his years; thesp captures Jacks fear of his father as well as the disturbing ways in which he takes after him. As his younger brothers Laramie Eppler and Tye Sheridan are wonderfully authentic. Penns Jack receives the least screen time of the three adult principals and he figures into the films most abstruse surreal passages which frame him against a series of desert backdrops and make direct use of biblical imagery. In these moments ""The Tree of Life"" seems to grope desperately if movingly for the sort of grand resolution its mysteries by definition cannot offer. But by that point its clear Malick after five films over nearly 40 years hasnt given up his search for new ways of seeing truth and beauty -- in life or in cinema.

TWITTER Brad Pitt gives one of his finest performances in Terrence Malicks drama about the beginnings of life on Earth and the travails of a 1950s Texas family writes Todd McCarthy. CANNES -- Brandishing an ambition its likely no film including this one could entirely fulfill The Tree of Life is nonetheless a singular work an impressionistic metaphysical inquiry into mankinds place in the grand scheme of things that releases waves of insights amid its narrative imprecisions. This fifth feature in Terrence Malicks eccentric four-decade career is a beauteous creation that ponders the imponderables asks the questions that religious and thoughtful people have posed for millennia and provokes expansive philosophical musings along with intense personal introspection. As such it is hardly a movie for the masses and will polarize even buffs some of whom might fail to grasp the connection between the depiction of the beginnings of life on Earth and the travails of a 1950s Texas family. But there are great heady things here both obvious and evanescent more than enough to qualify this as an exceptional and major film. Critical passions pro and con along with Brad Pitt in one of his finest performances will stir specialized audiences to attention but Fox Searchlight will have its work cut out for it in luring a wider public. Shot three years ago and molded and tinkered with ever since by Malick and no fewer than five editors Life is shaped in an unconventional way not as a narrative with normal character arcs and dramatic tension but more like a symphony with several movements -- each expressive of its own natural phenomena and moods. Arguably music plays a much more important role here than do words (there is some voice-over but scarcely any dialogue at all for nearly an hour) whereas the soaring sometimes grandiose soundtrack -- comprising 35 mostly classical excerpts drawn from Bach Brahms Berlioz Mahler Holst Respighi Gorecki and others in addition to the contributions of Alexandre Desplat -- dominates in the way it often did in Stanley Kubricks work. Indeed this comparison is inevitable as Life is destined to be endlessly likened to 2001 A Space Odyssey because to the spacy imagery of undefinable celestial lights and formations as well as because of its presentation of key hypothetical moments in the evolution of life on this planet. There are also equivalent long stretches of silence and semi-boredom designed perhaps to provide some time to muse about matters rarely raised in conventional narrative films. That Malick intends to think large is indicated by an opening quotation from the Book of Job in which God intimidates the humble man by demanding ""Where were you when I laid the foundation of the Earth? Tell me if you have understanding."" Job is not cited again but is more or less paraphrased when in moments of great personal distress a small-town mother cries out ""Lord why? Where are you?"" and ""What are we to you?"" Life doesnt answer these questions but fashions a relationship between its big-picture perspective and its intimate story that crucially serves the films philosophical purposes. Much of the early going is devoted to spectacular footage of massive natural phenomena both in space and on Earth gaseous masses light and matter in motion volcanic explosions fire and water the creation and growth of cells and organisms eventually the evolution of jellyfish and even dinosaurs represented briefly by stunningly realistic creatures one of which oddly appears to express compassion for another. Juxtaposed with this are the lamentations of a mother (Jessica Chastain) for a son who has just died in unexplained circumstances and for a time it seems that placing the everyday doings of the OBrien family of a quiet Texas town in the shadow of the seismic convulsions pertaining to the planets creation represents an inordinately elaborate way of expressing what Bogart said in Casablanca that ""the problems of three little people dont amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" But while that might be true it is also the case that those very problems -- and everything else that people experience -- are all that matter at the time one is experiencing them and are therefore of surpassing importance. Whatever else can -- and will -- be said about it Life gets the balance of its extraordinary dual perspective between the cosmic and the momentary remarkably right which holds it together even during its occasional uncertain stretches. Least effective is the contemporary framing material centered on the oldest OBrien kid Jack portrayed as a middle-aged man by Sean Penn. A successful architect Jack looks troubled and preoccupied as he moves through a world defined by giant Houston office towers and atriums shot so as to resemble secular cathedrals. While the connection to Jacks childhood years is clear the dramatic contributions of these largely wordless scenes are weak even at the end when a sense of reconciliation and closure is sought by the sight of flowers and disparate souls gathering on a beach in a way that uncomfortably resembles hippie-dippy reveries of the late 1960s. But the climactic shortfall only marginally saps the impact of the central story of family life. Occupying a pleasant but not lavish home on a wide dirt street in a town that matches ones idealized vision of a perfect 1950s community (its actually Smithville population 3900 just southeast of Austin and previously seen in Hope Floats) the family is dominated by a military veteran father (Pitt) who lays down the law to his three boys seemingly more by rote than because of any necessity. Hes compulsively physical with them playfully affectionately and violently and yet rigidly holds something back. Within Malicks scheme of things Dad represents nature while Mom (Chastain) stands for grace. Great pals among themselves Jack (Hunter McCracken) R.L. (Pitt look-alike Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan) range all over town and would seem to enjoy near-ideal circumstances in which to indulge their youth. But working in a manner diametrically opposed to that of theater dramatists inclined to spell everything out Malick opens cracks and wounds by inflection indirection and implication. Using fleet camerawork and jump-cutting that combine to intoxicating effect the picture builds to unanticipated levels of disappointment and tragedy much of it expressed with a minimum of dialogue in the final stages of Pitts terrific performance. Embodying the American ideal with his clean-cut good looks open face look-you-in-the-eyes directness and strong build Pitts Mr. OBrien embodies the optimism and can-do attitude one associates with the postwar period. But this man had other unfulfilled dreams -- he became ""sidetracked"" as he says -- and as his pubescent oldest son begins to display a troublesome rebelliousness fractures begins to show in his own character as well heartbreakingly so. Voice-over snippets suggestive of states of mind register more importantly than dialogue and both are trumped by the diverse musical elements and the rumblings and murmurs of nature which have all been blended in a masterful sound mix. Emmanuel Lubezki outdoes himself with cinematography of almost unimaginable crispness and luminosity. As in The New World the camera is constantly on the move forever reframing in search of the moment which defines the films impressionistic manner. Production designer Jack Fisk and costume designer Jacqueline West make indispensable contributions to creating the films world. That not a single image here seems fake or artificial can only be the ultimate praise for the work of senior visual effects supervisor Dan Glass and his team while the presence of Douglas Trumbull as visual effects consultant further cements the films connection to 2001.

But its also hard not to conclude that this hugely anticipated epic movie from the lesser-spotted 67-year-old poet of American cinema is a work that stretches itself so broadly by asking Big Questions that it ends up dealing in platitudes.Still The Tree of Life which won the Palme dOr at Cannes back in May offers breathtaking imagery and even manages to survive an epic detour to the dawn of time featuring the Big Bang dinosaurs meteors and all. Its so ambitious and full of inquiring ideas and questions about our place in the world that perhaps inevitably it feels like a grand folly - albeit a heartfelt and stimulating one. Such is the chaos of life the universe and everything maybe thats the only appropriate outcome of such a project?Here Malick takes his interests in mans essential nature to a more universal plane. You could say the film is set in the 1950s as it portrays in fragmentary detail the life of a 50s family a mother (Jessica Chastain) father (Brad Pitt) and three young sons one of whom they lose as a teenager. Early on the mothers voiceover sets up a debate asking whether man should follow the more selfish way of nature or the less selfish way of grace and she and her husband embody both approaches. She is a loving presence photographed among trees birds and butterflies; he is a businessman prone to anger who tells his sons If you want to succeed you cant be too good.Time is fluid even in this chapter its more poetic than real. But then the film takes an extraordinary leap. We go back millions of years in time to the beginning of the world and a long section complete with choral music that stands as a staggeringly crafted hymn to creation. We see swirling gases planets emerging and the beginning of life itself which leads to plants fish and dinosaurs. It suggests we should see the family of the rest of the film as an archetype a typical family in Biblical terms even and maybe not even of any particular time.And yet instead of looking back from the family to the context of pre-history you could also look back to them from now and see their story as an origin tale for modern America. Malick prompts such a view by later showing one of the sons played by Sean Penn in the present day - in a vague business context in a modern city but also in more dreamlike scenes wandering in the desert. In the films heavenly final scene he gathers on a beach with a crowd of characters including his own family as they were in the 1950s. It is then that the film will tip into an uncomfortable place for some. It feels overtly religious and even Christian (rather than just interested in the spiritual) as the sound of Amen wails repeatedly from the soundtrack.If The Tree of Life sounds like a swirl of images and ideas suggestions and juxtapositions thats exactly what it  is. Taken alone the films imagery should give great pleasure to Malicks fans and newcomers alike. Leaving aside the novelty of the magically rendered pre-history scenes the 1950s episodes look gorgeous. The elemental crisp photography making even suburbia look like a place close to nature is incredibly alluring.And yet for all the grand ideas and the sweep of history at its core the film comes to feel repetitive and even simplistic. Its not so crude as to portray Pitts character as demonic or evil but its portrayal of Chastains character as an angel of the Earth begins to feel shallow and the ritual loss of innocence that the sons go through also feels laboured. While it fascinates as much as it frustrates the films saving grace is that it always feels honest and never cynical. It seems both relevant to us and personal to the filmmaker. It doesnt always communicate well and when it does it can be trite but its a film thats incredibly beautiful and wide open for the taking.

Initially enthralled by the photography I increasingly found myself wondering when the advertising message was going to come on such was the nativity of this movie. I came online to see how it reviewed and saw this one which pretty much nailed how I felt. As a collection of images sure its beautiful but then it was spoilt for me not only for its preachiness but also for how widely it missed the mark. I get what it was trying to say but the nativity of that statement was breathtaking. Pretty much the only thing voting for it was its honesty but thats not enough to redeem it.

Engage the viewer to like or dislike the characters 2. I must be intrigrided by the narrative and want to see more. 3. I must want to see how these characters interact and resolve this narrative. 4. I must be engaged with the narrative to have questions I want answers. 5.I must want to care about these characters and their story and how they come to a a consclusion. Not one of these criteria were met in the 1st 30 minutes.. If these criteria are not met in 30 minutes the film is not going to get any better Walk out or better still run out and ask for your money back. This is coming from someone who is a film school graduate and this mandate has never failed me.

Frankly Id rather hear about whats so good about the film rather than a cheap put-down of a total stranger. The upshot of this blog so far is that Malick brings out the patronisers amongst us. If I were to join their ranks Id say that there are people who see a film like this and think wow hes making all the right noises and showing all the trendy images this must be art. C-R-A-P does not spell art. And endorsement by patronisers of fellow critics doesnt make for critical assessment of a work of crap er art in this case.

This was art for arts sake at a time when were moving away from that narcissistic approach to self-expression. Just splattering pain over the canvas and giving it an exotic name doesnt cut the mustard any more. The audience has wisened up. Andy Warhol would have loved this giant ink blotter of Malicks. Malick has to find a form of expression that doesnt rob so many people of their 19.50. The theatre I was in had about three hundred people and it was down to about forty souls by the end of the first half-hour. Thats grand larceny on a global scale. But the real villains in this affair are the critics who just cant bring themselves to say what needs to be said to avert the loss of our money to the box office. Its got that way I dont take any notice of them anymore. And if the boofheads at Cannes think a certain films terrific I strike it off my list of movies to see. Can we see where all this pretence pretension sucking-up and self-indulgence is getting us? Not just nowhere but deeper into civilizational collapse. When the arts go the rest tend to follow. Our artists need a giant kick up the seat padding.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 7 2012FiercehairdoFeaturedI really disliked this film. It wears its claims to Depth and Meaning on its sleeve yet its profundity is entirely bogus. Aesthetically styled like a posh TV commercial even its claims to beauty are not justified - I found it repetitive and quite empty visually very pretty but very boring. The endless footage of floaty steady-cam shots of kids playing in sunlit treelined streets really start to wear thin.The best section - the Origin of the Universe bit - is interesting but one kept expecting Brian Coxs voice to appear over the soundtrack. The whole thing feels like part nature doc part cosmology doc part posh TV commercial. I was begging for it to end but when the ending comes boy is it a humdinger of BS Literally taking us to some kind of heavenly afterlife where we all meet up with dead loved ones... My jaw hit the floor with the dumb simplicity of it all. Over two hours to get to this? I think Malicks is a massively over-rated director. His films are too often ponderous tedious and wrapped up in a phoney airy-fairy mumbo jumbo Big Question whispered voice over that really doesnt come close to dealing with genuinely interesting philosophical questions but instead just affects an air of depth and profundity. It is the style of depth without the content. I do wish the many film critics in thrall to his myth would wake up and face the fact that yes Malick is an interesting director but also very flawed and too often deadly dull.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 3 2012PeterFeaturedThe important thing to remember about The Tree of Life is that it is a personal statement about grief and loss on the part of the director. Perhaps those who have experienced grief themselves will more easily empathise with Terrence Malicks brave attempt at portraying the complex feelings associated with the trauma of the premature loss of a loved one. I found the sequence on the beach towards the end of the film very moving hinting as it does at the possibility of some form of redemption.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 3 2012PeterFeaturedThe important thing to remember about The Tree of Life is that it is a personal statement about grief and loss on the part of the director.

How tedious it is to hear people defending this tripe called The Tree Of Life while vulgarly displaying their own ignorance and pretentiousness (see dangarrob and others). I like what Malick has done in the past as a poet with an eye for sacred detail. But the size of the canvas can undo any poet by smothering him as it outstrips his talent. The Baz Luhrmann analogy was well put. Both men swam out past the shark net. Theres a simple rule in this sort of thing. If you charge people to gain access to your product they have a right to demand satisfaction given that the product was vetted as worthy of exposition. In the case of The Tree Of Life the producers should have said to cinema-goers look go in and have a look at it. If you like it pay; if you dont like it say so in the suggestion box provided. What we got was an arrogant film by an arrogant artist peddled by an arrogant production and marketing team. A pox on you all I say.

Since your patronising views on other peopleaEUR(tm)s IQ and educational standards were based on whether they liked Tree of Life or not it is just embarrassing that you then go on to make asinine observations about the film shrouded in atrocious grammar and expression.

The importance of choosing a film according to personal affinity or educational background is mostly ignored when choosing what to watch at the cinema since films tend to be available to everyone without any restrictions in level of maturity or IQ for instance. Oftentimes the only necessary requirement when making this choice is to know the actors involved in the cast as a guidance of the type of film we are expecting (i.e. Brad Pitt). Unfortunately the undesired consequences of choosing a film this way is to come out frustrated or confused when dealing with material with which one feels out of depth with. There are films where the opinion of an spectator will account to nothing and their intrinsic value doesnt depend on whether the message of the film is understood or not by a majority of spectators. Some films are alike other forms of art which stand by their own rules and standards and need to be actively experienced. ""The tree of life"" is a welcomed representative of these films and a reminder to us that film is more than just painting by numbers.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 28 2011dangarrobFeaturedThere are certain films which demand from the spectator to have gone through certain personal life experiences to be properly understood and enjoyed.

This was self-indulgence and sentimentality artists engage in at their peril. The cinema is not a place to replicate life but to transcend it by artifice (art).

Those who say what they honestly felt from the experience of watching this ordeal of a movie and those who want to be seen to be with the avant garde who see mystical things the rest of us are blind to. This last post was of that ilk. I dont mind being told Im backward so long as my accuser is ready to show his cards and explain what he can see and the rest of us cant. All we get is motherhood statements that show nothing of their real appreciation of the film. Big deal How about a bit less showing off and a bit more erudition of the type you claim to possess. All I know is that the cinema I went to emptied in the the first twenty minutes when the audience realized we were being had. I felt like leaving too but I was keen to see how this pretentious exercise in art developed. It just went from bad to worse. One trhing that really gets up my nose is the snob who comes on here to say what a superior chap he is compared to us cretins and makes as big a berk of himself as Malick did on this occasion. This film was a bloody dud and all those whove had a contrary view havent made a case to the contrary. All theyve done is say hey you uneducated morons look at me. Im terrific. (Spew spew). I think this movie was crap. A\nd the reason I say so is because it broke the rules that keep a viewer in his seat. This thing had nothing of the mature stuff that writers takes a generation to develop. Malick just said Cop this took the millions and ran. Then these sweet things line up to say what a bunch of idiots we are for thinking we were dudded. I want my money back And if this last person to post is such an advanced human being let him pay for Malicks abuse of our intelligence on this occasion. I put my money where my mouth is. I paid to watch this garbage so Ive paid my dues in saying what I think. The bad movie is one thing. But the pretenders who say were a bunch of plonkers deserve a special rogering if they cant explain whats so inspiring about this inane piece of filmic expression (aka expressionistic wank). If these bods get their way film criticism will have joined all other criticism by doing completelu up the bottoms of all concerned.

Malick can make good films - even great films - weve seen that already. But he did a Baz with this one. He shouldve studied how Kubrick pulled off 2001 so deftly while its sequel 2010 in lesser hands was a disaster like the Tree Of Life. It also pays to test the product before its distributed. The fact that it would empty cinemas so rapidly could have been known before it went out to the world cinemas cheating people out of millions of dollars.
