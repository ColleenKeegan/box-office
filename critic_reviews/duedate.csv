By Anthony Lane Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis in a new movie by Todd Phillips.   Credit Illustration by Kirsten Ulve With whom would you rather be stuck on a long journey Zach Galifianakis or Robert Downey Jr.? Its a close call the stoner hobbit hiding in a spinney of beard or the unreachable Iron Man twitching and squeaking with nervous intelligence for fear that if he ever ceased he might rust up like his counterpart of tin? Such is the quandary of ""Due Date"" the new comedy from Todd Phillips who made ""The Hangover."" Galifianakis plays Ethan Tremblay travelling to Hollywood with celestial ambitions. "" Two and a Half Men is the reason I wanted to become an actor"" he says although from what cultural height ""Due Date"" can afford to gaze down on lowly TV shows is hard to gauge. Downey plays Peter Highman an architect heading home to Los Angeles for the birth of his child. Complete strangers they collide at the Atlanta airport but wind up making the trip by car. So we have a pair of incompatibles getting to know and kind of love each other on the road. Its not the most high-concept movie of the year or indeed of any other. For one thing defenders of ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" directed by John Hughes in 1987 will sense an intruder on their patch although if you seek narrative complexity ""Due Date"" makes Hughess movie look like ""Little Dorrit."" Right from the start when Ethan and Peter get involved in a fracas and thrown off their flight Phillips doesnt really bother with ordinary logic fluffing the loss of Peters I.D. (what sort of professional leaves his wallet with his luggage?) as if to stress that what matters here is the bonding of his two leads and nothing else. But lazy plotting tends to niggle at the back of viewers minds especially if those viewers are replete with memories of ""The Hangover"" which was raised from the rut of adult frat-house humor by its neat construction--the way in which Phillips vaulted over the trauma of the stag night leaving us to wonder right up to the closing credits just how Rabelaisian it had been. Given the new films unwavering focus on Downey and Galifianakis how do they fare? Its an odd conjunction; buddy movies tend to pitch the goofball against the square and you could argue that Galifianakis should ideally be bounced off a wall of deadpan--the best of all walls being Charles Grodin in ""Midnight Run."" But Downey though his surface can be smooth is turbid with frustration underneath and there are times when ""Due Date"" assumes the air of a queasy contest with each man trying or straining to be the less predictable. Not only should we not know what theyre likely to do next; they dont even know themselves. Hence the scene in which Peter confronted with a noisome child thumps him hard in the stomach. (The audience howled with mirth at this and I could see what was cruel and effective about it but funny? For a guy about to have a child of his own?) As for Ethan he waits until the two of them short of cash decide to catch some sleep in the car and then by way of a nightcap beats off. It was never like this in ""It Happened One Night."" The addition of gross-out gags to the road movie is hardly surprising--for good measure we get Ethans pet pooch following his masters example in the back seat--but it feels depressing nonetheless. By tradition the inhabitants of the cross-country genre need only look outward through the windshield to see a litany of incidents whether antic or mollifying zoom toward them like bugs whereas ""Due Date"" suffers from an inward onanistic slant that seems in every sense a waste of space. We know that American road movies by and large are quickened by a target or a deadline while their European cousins--Wim Wenderss ""Alice in the Cities"" and ""Kings of the Road"" Manuel Poiriers ""Western"" or almost anything by Aki Kaurismaki--take more time to survey the passing land but wherever you are and whatever your hurry why not meander for a while? ""Due Date"" will have none of it. America zips by in snippets as though on the LCD screen of a point-and-shoot camera arousing not a scrap of curiosity. As a treat we are given helicopter shots of an open road and of the Grand Canyon but in each case to indicate that we have reached an emotional crossroads Phillips tips a load of sad random music over the image--Neil Youngs ""Old Man"" then Rod Stewart rasping out ""Amazing Grace."" We are not amazed. ""Due Date"" is most interesting and most fearful when it loiters on the threshold of the homoerotic. Its a thoroughly man-centric movie such women as do exist being confined--a drug dealer named Heidi (Juliette Lewis) because she is way too zonked to leave the house and Peters wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) because she is heavily pregnant. Even the dead are male; Ethan goes to the Grand Canyon to scatter the ashes of his father. Then we get masturbation; we get Peter high on Ethans weed declaring hazy love to him from the passenger seat; and we get repeated rearview shots of Ethan leading his little dog with a purposeful mince as if auditioning for a role in ""La Cage aux Folles."" Whats going on here? In the end nothing. Downey especially is so audacious an actor that Im sure he would have been happy to pursue the implications of such hints but Phillips veers away from them lest he unsettle a portion of his audience. He prefers more familiar risks jokes about corrupt Mexican officials jokes about an angry Iraq veteran in a wheelchair (""Im handicapable"") jokes about vaginas. ""Due Date"" in short takes an adventurous form and recasts it as essentially conservative making sure that neither we nor the characters grow any wiser or wilder. The hero of ""Sullivans Travels"" when he got back to L.A. was an altered soul having come face to face with the cravings of the people; but the Peter who lost his I.D. in Atlanta returns with his identity intact. He has a gunshot wound and a broken arm but like Ethan they are a silly inconvenience not a menace to his life. For all the difference his odyssey made he could have been sent in the mail. Of the many weapons deployed by Western powers against Islamic extremism comedy has been the most sparingly used. There are two reasons first the fear of reprisal from the offended and second a feeling that this particular field of conflict on which so many have suffered can never be a subject fit for laughter. The first of these objections is sound enough as shown by the Danish cartoon controversy. The second is more troubling; you dont have to be Lenny Bruce to think that nothing should lie beyond the remit of the comic imagination yet its a brave man or woman who can plow heedlessly through every claim of decency and taste. Such bravery or foolhardiness comes naturally to the British comedian Chris Morris--an actor writer TV presenter and now with ""Four Lions"" a feature-film director. Welcome to the funny world of the suicide bomber. Omar (Riz Ahmed) works as a security guard in a northern city--the North of England that is under heavy skies. His wife is a nurse; they have a cute son who watches as his dad in his spare time sits at a laptop and prepares for martyrdom. Omar bright-eyed and sharp-featured may be the sole intelligent being in the film. His comrades in arms--Faisal (Adeel Akhtar) Waj (Kayvan Novak) and Barry (Nigel Lindsay)--are outright cretins with Barry the most deluded of all; he has converted to Islam and gone straight to its lunatic fringe. Society in Barrys eyes is begging for destruction ""We got women talking back we got people playing stringed instruments. Its the end of days"" he says. Haltingly and despite a disastrous visit to a training camp in Pakistan they put together a bomb attack on London. And lo it comes to pass. The invective energy of ""Four Lions"" and its Swiftian vision of a confederacy of dunces are never in doubt. The problem is one of form. Morris made his name in radio and television and his spells as the front man of ""The Day Today"" (1994) a mock TV-news program and later of ""Brass Eye"" a mock documentary series were so successful in disembowelling the medium from inside with all its inflamed visual habits that some of us have found it hard to take any news channel seriously ever since. With a severity that French theoreticians can only dream of Morris questioned whether we could still under any circumstances hope to acquire a grasp of factual truth amid the writhings of media representation; to that extent ""Four Lions"" marks a backward step. There are flickers of faux-documentary plus ironic glances at Omar the loather of Western culture as he cheerily explains his cause in terms of ""The Lion King"" and at Waj during the climax when he boasts ""I got hostages and everything--like X-Box Counterstrike."" Most of the film however tells the story straight with faith in its own approach. It mocks the dumb relentlessly and in so doing it allows us to believe with a dab of smugness that we know better. Whereas Morris in his prime showed that we know nothing at all.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

""Due Date"" is the cinematic equivalent of a hangover from ""The Hangover"" - not surprising since that films director Todd Phillips and costar Zach Galifianakis are repeat offenders here. Its slobby goony and gross also occasionally funny but not occasionally enough.Galifianakis plays Ethan a sweet-souled one-man wrecking crew whom we first encounter in the Atlanta airport accidentally shearing the door off a chauffered town car. The occupant of said town car is Robert Downey Jr.s Peter an uptight architect anxious to fly home to Los Angeles in time for the birth of his first child. Through a series of serio-comic machinations that place them on a no-fly list Ethan and Peter end up sharing a cramped rental car back to L.A.Downey is not entirely comfortable playing straight man and a little of Galifianakiss antics - hes like all Three Stooges rolled into one - goes a long way. If the comic premise of this film appeals to you youd be better off renting ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" with John Candy and Steve Martin.

A review of the road-trip comedy Due Date with optional spoilers. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 5 2010 507 PM Two Dudes One Car A review of the road-trip comedy Due Date with optional spoilers. By Dana Stevens Zach Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. in Due Date. Due Date (Warner Bros.) is a movie thats been made countless times before from It Happened One Night to Planes Trains and Automobiles to The Sure Thing a pair of completely dissimilar people forced by circumstance to travel a long distance in one anothers company get in and out of a series of comic scrapes before falling in love. Or becoming the best of friends which by the homosocial logic of the buddy comedy amounts to the same thing. Its not that a reworking of this familiar material couldnt be made funny again but it would take a lot more imagination than this movie directed by dude-comedy auteur Todd Phillips ( Road Trip Old School The Hangover) seems willing to put in. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The chemistry between these two mismatched leads played by Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis seems inspired by the relationship between Steve Martin and John Candy in the classic Planes Trains and Automobiles (which if you havent seen already you should rent sometime before Thanksgiving). Downeys character Peter Highman is a Type-A architect trying to get from Atlanta to L.A. in time for his wifes (Michelle Monaghan) scheduled C-section. Galifianakis plays Ethan Tremblay an aspiring actor with a perm a French bulldog a coffee can containing his dead fathers ashes and a lot of irritating mannerisms. (As a character Ethan doesnt make a lot of sense; one minute hes a fat stoner slob in the Old School mode the next minute hes almost like a mincing gay stereotype though his sexual valence is never quite clear.) Advertisement After these two strangers board the same plane Ethan manages to get them both kicked off--and placed on a no-fly list--by loudly discussing bombs within earshot of the flight crew. Peter with his wallet and all his I.D. left behind on the plane is forced to rely on Ethan to rent a car and make the trip cross-country. And then they make excellent time arrive safely and part with a firm handshake the end. Kidding Of course our heroes encounter obstacles (a car crash a declined credit card a wrong turn that takes them over the Mexican border) and oddball characters (a spacey pot dealer played by Juliette Lewis a paraplegic Western Union employee played by Danny McBride). Of course they get on each others last nerves with Peter at one point abandoning Ethan at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. And of course the tightly wound Peter gradually learns to let his guard down and the scattered narcissistic Ethan begins to get at least an inkling of how incredibly annoying he is to be around. But thats the thing Neither of the two main characters in Due Date really changes or changes in an emotionally plausible enough way to hit the heartwarming note Phillips seems to be aiming for. Ive written before about the remorse deficit in recent buddy comedies. In Superbad Drillbit Taylor Hot Tub Time Machine and other films about male friendship theres been a tendency for protagonists to treat each other truly shittily in ways that a real-life friendship might never recover from then forgive each other far too easily just in time for a jerry-rigged happy ending. A few scenes before the end of Due Date as the two men peer down into the gulf of the Grand Canyon its revealed that Ethan did something really terrible to Peter near the beginning of the movie and has been lying about it ever since. (Spoiler Place your mouse here if you want to know what Ethan said.)   If a real-life friend--especially one youd known for 36 hours and trusted for about 12--did something like this to you youd not only end the friendship then and there but fight the urge to push him off the cliff. Instead after a brief outburst Peter swallows his anger invites Ethan back into the car and never mentions the infraction again. Were supposed to accept this as a generous gesture of friendship but it reads as a pure narrative contrivance. If the goodwill thats developed between the two men isnt contingent upon some basic code of ethics (that Ethan has violated) why should we believe in or care about their friendship? Phillips whos always enjoyed pushing gross-out taboos just to the R-rating point tries to wring laughs from the following situations masturbating while sitting a few feet away from a stranger in a parked car; spitting on someone elses dog; spitting on a glass partition that separates you from an office clerk; watching a dog masturbate. Basically as many situations as possible that combine spitting masturbation and dogs plus a moment when one man throws up on anothers gunshot wound. But the most offensive bodily fluid being hurled around in Due Date are the tears that Phillips dishonestly tries to wrest from the audiences eyes. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

"Due Date review Todd Phillips latest on-the-road film fails to reach new territory |       NJ.com comments Due Date review Todd Phillips latest on-the-road film fails to reach new territory Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 05 2010 at 752 AM View/Post Comments AP Photo/Warner Bros. Melinda Sue GordonRobert Downey Jr.right  and Zach Galifianakis take to the road in the cross-country buddy pic ""Due Date."" Todd Phillips needs to get off the road. The filmmaker has banked a small fortune for himself and his studios by making movies about overgrown adolescents out of control and often on the move -- whether it was ""Road Trip"" ""Old School"" or the gleefully incorrect ""The Hangover."" But now with ""Due Date"" the formula is running out of gas. Phillips new movie re-teams him with Zach Galifianakis of ""The Hangover"" adds Robert Downey Jr. and finds a way to yoke these two strangers together for a cross-country trek to Los Angeles. Theyre in a hurry too. Downey needs to get home for the birth of his first child. Galifianakis needs to meet with a talent agent. The stakes are high and the clock is ticking. Both these performers are go-for-broke actors who inhabit every inch of their characters no matter how unpleasant. They elevate every (often underwritten) scene theyre in. And there are a few wonderful out-in-left-field appearances. Like Danny McBride as a Western Union clerk with a very short fuse. Or the marvelous Juliette Lewis as a drug dealer. (The bleary-eyed movie could have been called ""Planes Bongs and Automobiles."") But despite the lengths that Phillips will go to -- and a movie that tries to get laughs out of driving under the influence or a bratty child getting smacked around is willing to go far -- the comedy never takes off. Movie Review Due Date (R) Warner Bros. (95 in.) Directed by Todd Phillips. With Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations drug and alcohol abuse and violence. Stephen Whittys review TWO STARS Perhaps thats because the big emotional moments -- each character gets the chance to talk about his own personal father issues -- feel forced. Or that Galifianakis annoying furry freak brother feels a little too much like other annoying furry freak brothers hes played before. Or that when things get really desperate the film resorts to the oldest comedy cliche of all -- big loud stupid chases with police sirens blaring and as many devastating wrecks as the special-effects team can manage. (Can you remember when you really laughed at a car crash in a movie? Were you still getting carded?) Theres a slight stale smell of desperation there and thats a shame because an odd-couple pairing is still a sturdy setup for jokes. And Downey to his credit hasnt demanded that his character be the reasonable one (a far-too-typical concession to worried stars ""But what if the audience doesnt like me?"") If anything his A-type architect is even more unlikable than Galifianakis slob actor. Melinda Sue GordonRobert Downey Jr. (left) as Peter and Zach Galifianakis as Ethan in ""Due Date."" I sincerely would have enjoyed seeing Downey trying to struggle through Lamaze classes with Galifianakis as a painfully oversharing classmate. I would have gotten a kick out of watching him trying to finish remodeling a nursery for his child-to-be -- with Galifianakis as the incompetent contractor. There are many places where Phillips could have taken this. But first please -- pull over.

Watching ""Due Date"" I wasnt sure what worried me more that a generation of screenwriters has grown up knowing nothing except the movies they loved as kids -- or that those movies are the likes of ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles."" The amusing nonclassic that starred John Candy and Steve Martin gets not so much remade as recited like a sophomore in English class reading out loud in a bland monotone. Zach Galifianakis plays a ""wild man"" -- you know a ""crazy guy"" -- who gets his stuff mixed up with that of LA architect Peter (Robert Downey Jr.) at the airport in Atlanta. Theyre kicked off the plane and put on a no-fly list (even though Peter has done nothing wrong) and Peter having lost his wallet cant even rent a car. Unless hes forgotten how to operate a telephone he could just get another credit card and have some cash wired to him at the airport but instead he takes a 2000-mile ride with Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) a weed-loving would-be actor who is carrying his fathers ashes in a coffee can. Cue the Felix-and-Oscar shtick. Peter carefully maps out the optimal route across the country so he can get back home to his pregnant wife (Michelle Monaghan) in three days when she is due to deliver their child (why would he have strayed so far from home so close to her due date?). Ethan has the worlds lamest job -- he runs a fan site for ""Two and a Half Men."" Har? Zach Galifianakis chief comedy skill is that he looks like Zach Galifianakis (just as looking nerdy is about all Jon Cryer brings to the table). As in the most useless sitcoms the laffs depend entirely on someone behaving as ridiculously as possible in uninteresting ways devised by the dullest minds. Hold on to your hats Ethan eats waffles even though hes allergic to them. He does a bad Marlon Brando impression. He masturbates in the car with his friend in the back seat. And an ""emotional"" scene in which ashes get scattered over the Grand Canyon while Rod Stewart sings ""Amazing Grace"" is so cheesy an inveterate CBS watcher might nod with approval. Galifianakis -- this fur pudding this brown sheep this soggy lump of shag carpeting -- does the entire movie in a scowling deadpan not realizing that it was the bouncing playroom cheerfulness of John Candy and Chris Farley that made them so appealing. In the self-love scene a pet dog gets a bigger laugh. And Downey? He hasnt been so conspicuously wasted since the late 1990s. This huge talent is crammed into a straight mans straitjacket as director Todd Phillips (""The Hangover"") lines up a series of beatings. He gets shot he gets his arm broken he gets to yell at Ethan. If this abuse were a justified comeuppance for being too uptight it might be funny -- but hes the reasonable one and the guy wed most like to see suffer (after the screenwriters) is unscathed. With its insistent use of pieces of flair (Galifianakis wears a scarf a perm and a Lilith Fair T-shirt) and its rusty one-liners (""Im not an accountant -- Im not even Jewish"") ""Due Date"" is not so much a movie as an ""act"" one that belongs at a club called Shenanigans or maybe Chuckleheads -- or even someplace really dismal like Monday nights on CBS. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Bachelorette star found dead off Southern Calif. highway Read Next Bachelorette star found dead off Southern Calif. highway Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 42626 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21540 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 14896 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 05 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Nov. 05 2010 316PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The countdown is on and the seconds are ticking away on Due Date not to mention my deadline. There are but nine of them left so Im obliged to write fast and youre invited to read faster. Deep breath and here goes 9 On a business trip in Atlanta Peter Highman must fly back to L.A. immediately because his wife is very pregnant and the baby is almost due. Ergo the title. 8 The guy who has to get home has a chance meeting with a fellow traveller a chunky buffoon named Ethan who well-meaning but really annoying spends the rest of the movie turning the protracted journey into a living hell. Ergo the rip-off. Yep this bears a distinct yet shamelessly unacknowledged resemblance to Planes Trains amp; Automobiles. 7 That 1987 film with Steve Martin playing the straight man and John Candy the buffoon was funny with a heart. This version with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis is manic with an itch. Under the nuanced direction of John Hughes Candy made annoying seem hilarious and his broad girth endearing. As amped up by director Todd Phillips Galifianakis makes annoying seem annoying and his broad girth squeezed into tight jeans proudly displaying his plumbers crack not so endearing. 6 Phillips and Galifianakis you might recall are both hangovers from The Hangover. That flick also had guys heading off on a road trip and it was manic too. Apparently when these two arent borrowing from their betters theyre plagiarizing themselves. 5 Indeed there is a plane here the one that Ethan by shouting ""Bomb"" in a crowded cabin gets Peter kicked off of. And there are automobiles the various cars that our odd couple drive into ditches and over bridges and otherwise in the noble pursuit of mayhem smash up real good. In defence of the pics originality or perhaps simply given the current state of Amtrak there is no train. Actually I lie. For a fleeting moment in an aerial shot a pretty choo-choo can be glimpsed snaking along a scenic track. Consider it a homage. 4 Peter is allegedly a sober-sided architect but Downey perhaps fearful of losing the picture to his co-star refuses to play the straight man straight and keeps injecting him with heavy doses of Downeyesque weirdness and intensity. Not very generous of him. As for the Ethan character hes an aspiring actor of dubious talent - Galifianakis is perfect in the role. 3 This time out the script isnt content with just giving the buffoon a suitcase full of annoying habits. Nope it gives him a pet too a little bulldog thereby allowing the comedy to double up on its favourite joke Both the dog and its owner share a nightly fondness for self-pleasure. 2 The buffoon also has a coffee can in which he has poured the ashes of his recently deceased father. The can clearly marked COFFEE is introduced early. The punchline ""We just drank Daddy"" comes later. The time between seems very long but awaiting the expected always does. 1 A child is born. Her name is Rosie Highman. ""Does that sound right to you?"" someone disingenuously asks. Coming from a stillborn comedy it sounds absolutely right. 0 Finis.

"Due Date | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; due-date ) Due Date (United States 2010) November 04 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Reuniting director Todd Phillips with the actor whose name no one can pronounce (the inimitable Zach Galifianakis) would seem to represent an excellent cornerstone for another laugh-till-you-drop comedy. Add Robert Downey Jr. possibly the best American thespian working today and Due Dates prospects would seem to be stratospheric. Sadly this movie is proof that pedigree doesnt mean everything. At best this cross-country road trip movie feels like a warmed over update of Planes Trains and Automobiles with heavy doses of raunchiness patching the holes left by the affability of John Candy and the screen chemistry enjoyed by Candy and co-star Steve Martin. Phillips seems to have forgotten that bawdy comedy is only deemed ""edgy"" if its funny. When the seedy jokes fall flat the result is crass. Thats not to argue that Due Date is never funny. There are some sequences including one in which a dog imitates its master in inappropriate behavior and another in which Iron Man shows how a superhero deals with an unruly kid that hint at what Due Date could have been had it pushed the comedy envelope a little farther (as The Hangover did). But the films determination to spend time on failed relationship building between the two mismatched main characters and its unwillingness to veer away from the standard-order warm fuzzy ending make Due Date unremarkable. The film opens in Atlanta with Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) about to catch a flight home to Los Angeles where his pregnant wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) is hoping his return will precede the arrival of their first child. From the moment Peter steps out of the cab at the airport things start going wrong. Murphy has arrived in the person of Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) whose annoying friendliness and refusal to avoid words like ""terrorist"" and ""bomb"" while on board an aircraft result in Peter not only being forcibly removed from the plane by air marshals but put on the ""no fly"" list. Worse with his wallet still at his vacated seat he has no credit cards cash or I.D. Thats when Ethan comes to the rescue offering Peter a ride to L.A. Not long after the trip from hell has begun Peter will wish that he had imitated Forrest Gump and made the journey on foot. The best way to illustrate the central flaw in Due Date is by making a comparison with Planes Trains and Automobiles. The contrast is warranted since Due Date exists somewhere between an homage to the John Hughes film and an unofficial remake. Although its true that no trains have starring roles two have cameos. Its hard to imagine anyone with reasonable movie experience not emerging from Due Date to remark that it was better when it was called Planes Trains and Automobiles. Instead of going the John Candy route of setting Ethan up as a loveable loser this screenplay reduces him to a detestable irritant - a mosquito bite on the head of a zit. The films attempts to soften Ethan and provide an emotional component to his back story fail. They like the obligatory relationship that develops between him and Peter reek of Hollywood artifice. The key component that elevated Planes Trains and Automobiles - the chemistry between Steve Martin and John Candy - never materializes in Due Date. The interaction between Downey and Galifianakis shows no warmth and little depth. This is not Robert Downey Jr. at his best. Admittedly playing the straight man in a raunchy sophomoric comedy is not the most challenging or fulfilling job but Downey brings less verve to it than he has to any recent role including that of Tony Stark. Galifianakis deserves points for generating as much audience dislike as he does. One supposes he borrowed tips from Steve Carell his co-star in Dinner for Schmucks. Carells character in that movie and Galifianakis in this one are essentially the same individual with an identical critical personality trait they are irritating beyond belief. Jamie Foxx Downeys co-star in The Soloist makes an appearance that is more in the nature of an extended cameo than a supporting part. Due Date is not without humor but it lacks the explosive spontaneity of The Hangover. The script is not as clean or crisp and some of the funnier moments appear to have been shoehorned into the final production since they have no bearing on the movies trajectory (a perfect example being Peters method of dealing with an unruly child). Due Date also suffers from the listless formulaic pattern that characterizes many road films both in terms of how the characters relate to each other and how events unfold. One of the delights of The Hangover was its total unpredictability. One could argue that Due Date asks the question of how much laughter can be wrung out of an overly familiar story. The answer at least in this case is not enough to justify paying the price of a full theatrical admission.

Starring Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis Jamie Foxx Michelle Monaghan Juliette Lewis Danny McBride RZA Matt Walsh Brody Stevens Todd Phillips Director Todd Phillips Running time 135 Release Opened Nov 5 2010  Editorial Review Galifianakis deliversBy Ann HornadayFriday November 5 2010With ""Due Date"" director Todd Phillips perfects the particular brand of comic alchemy that made his 2009 comedy ""The Hangover"" such an unexpectedly huge hit. Like the previous film this one features mismatched guys who dont know each other very well on a road trip punctuated by ever-more-outrageous and physically painful mishaps. Whereas ""The Hangover"" featured a baby in sunglasses as a cheap-laugh-getting prop ""Due Date"" swaps the infant out for a little bulldog who masturbates on cue with the flawless timing of Lassie performing for the next piece of kibble. Of course the main thing ""Due Date"" has in common with ""The Hangover"" is Zach Galifianakis the portly comedian who like Jackie Gleason and Chris Farley before him betrays uncommon grace despite his heavy frame. Theres a money shot early in ""Due Date"" when Galifianakis shoves his unsheathed hairy stomach against Robert Downey Jr.s face but its when the camera pulls back to reveal the burly bearlike Galifianakis delicately bouncing along in peg-legged acid-wash jeans tossing his mane of permed hair that his physical gifts are best revealed. Hes a hirsute gloriously unself-conscious man-child unfettered by the laws that govern the rest of us including those of good taste social interaction and gravity itself. That pretty much sums up Ethan Tremblay Galifianakiss character in ""Due Date"" which conspires to have Tremblay and architect Peter Highman (Downey) meet cute at the Atlanta airport then embark on a cross-country car trip so that Peter can attend the birth of his first child. Its a concept that was no doubt pitched to studio executives in one elevator ride and most likely thats why it works so efficiently. ""Due Date"" promises to be a hit with its core constituency satisfying ""Hangover"" fans with the steady stream of slapstick gags raunchy jokes stoner comedy crunching action and caustically aggressive male bonding theyve come to expect from the Phillips atelier. For all its formulaic predictability though ""Due Date"" possesses its share of surprises. For one thing its a departure for Downey who plays the straight man here with convincing deadpan self-effacement. (The movies first laugh occurs when Peter tells an airport security guard that he has never done drugs in his life.) He knows his job is simply to be a foil for Galifianakis and he graciously cedes center stage; there are moments when you can almost see Downey take a step back to admire his co-stars willingness to make Ethan look ridiculous but never contemptible. And ""Due Date"" is way darker than ""The Hangover"" constantly pushing Peter to a mean physically threatening edge then pulling him back. A ""Cable Guy"" brand of biting hostility bubbles through the movie making it edgier and more dangerously compelling than garden-variety bromances. Ethan may be a naif in the tradition of Candide and other literary sweethearts but his unworldliness carries its own potential for inflicting anarchic even creepy violence. One case in point is an encounter with an Iraq war vet played by Danny McBride; the scene that starts out full of comic promise but devolves into a brutal unfunny beat-down. (""Due Date"" also features cameos from Jamie Foxx and a wonderfully blowsy Juliette Lewis.) Later when Peter and Ethan open up to each other about their fathers Peters heartfelt confession isnt met with a hug but a derisive bark of laughter. ""Due Date"" isnt pretty; in fact it gets kind of ugly. But at least in the eyes of certain beholders therein lies its peculiar bent beauty.Contains profanity drug use and sexual content.

Watch a clip from the film ""127 Hours"" starring James Franco. Video courtesy of Fox Searchlight. The title refers to the time it took Aron Ralston the real-life mountain climber played sensationally well by James Franco to extricate himself from a slot canyon into which he had tumbled during a solitary wilderness hike in Utah seven years ago. Extrication required amputation--Mr. Ralstons left-handed severing of his right forearm which was pinned between a chalkstone boulder and the canyon wall. Because this agony is depicted vividly albeit briefly you may go in with your eyes wide open but not keep them that way throughout. (My own approach was a combination of sidewise glances and defensive squints.) To justify such a harrowing sequence any mainstream movie would have to be exceptional and this one certainly is--its exciting stirring often funny sometimes lyrical and unusually thoughtful. And with that one egregious exception genuinely pleasurable. The film is an intriguing match-up of style and substance. On the face of it Mr. Ralstons experience which he recounted in his book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" would seem as confining for the camera as it was for the hero. (The book was adapted by the director and Simon Beaufoy.) And the feeling of confinement can be extreme. Against all physical logic were wedged right in there with Aron watching his struggles from a fairly hard place of our own. Yet that confinement co-exists with surreal freedom. Mr. Boyles gorgeously reckless ecstatic style --developed in such earlier films as ""Trainspotting"" and ""Millions"" as well as ""Slumdog Millionaire""--allows him to break out of the canyon with the greatest of ease by tapping into the flow of Arons memories fantasies fears and epiphanies. Thus his camera tilts skyward to see the slow transit of a raven that Aron saw every morning and drills down to the whirling video drum of the fallen climbers minicamcorder (or the point of his blunt knife as it approaches a bone inside his arm). Yet the camera also hurtles across a mesa at warp speed to the bottle of water that Aron recalls having left in his truck; constructs exquisite dreamscapes from cherished moments in his family life; revisits his lover whos played by Clemence Poesy and the pretty young hikers he chanced to meet just before his fall; studies voluptuous sandstone shapes and in a single literally breathtaking shot pulls up and out of Arons strait prison for a birds-eye view of the vast and silent land that surrounds it. (The directors of photography were Anthony Dod Mantle who shot ""Slumdog"" and Enrique Chediak. As in ""Slumdog"" A.R. Rahmans score drives the narrative with relentless force.) ENLARGE James Franco as stranded climber Aron Ralston in 127 Hours Fox Searchlight Visual and dramatic fugues notwithstanding the film is essentially a one-man show and Mr. Franco was an inspired choice to play the man. Theres no one quite like him in--or conspicuously out of--Hollywood these days. As a charmingly cheerful exponent of the Robert Mitchum screw-it-all school of acting he finds time to direct make fine art contribute articles to various publications (including this one) and is currently pursuing doctoral studies at Yale. But whats so valuable to his performance in ""127 Hours"" is his very American cheerfulness combined with quick intelligence. When Aron takes off for his fateful adventure his high spirits which the actor and his director convey brilliantly are an expression of his heedlessness--he hasnt bothered to tell anyone where hes going. Its entertaining in a foreboding way to watch this outdoorsman set out with equipment that John Muir could never have dreamed of--superstrong climbing ropes gleaming pulleys digital wristwatch-cum-altimeter a tiny Petzl lamp affixed to his cap. His cool gear gives him a seductive sense of security while his little still camera in tandem with his digicam will let him narrate what may be the last hours of his life. Thats not why the cameras went into Arons backpack of course. They were there because this is an age of ritual self-dramatization so entertainment becomes fascination as Mr. Franco charts Arons progression from happy narcissism to solemn awareness of mortal peril. And to an acceptance of personal responsibility ""Its me"" Aron reminds himself. ""I chose this. I chose all of this."" His solemnity seems just as authentic as the jauntiness it banishes which is saying a lot. (The only passage that struck me as false though enjoyable was one that makes indirect reference to ""Slumdogs"" game-show madness.) ""127 Hours"" treats profound issues with unforced wisdom and uncommon grace. The story is one of survival through almost unthinkable self-mutilation but the subject is self-discovery. By the time Aron raises himself up from the bowels of the earth into the blazing sun he knows who he is and we do too. Fair Game Watch a clip from the film ""Fair Game"" starring Naomi Watts. Courtesy Summit Entertainment Naomi Watts is Valerie Plame and Sean Penn is her husband Joe Wilson in ""Fair Game"" a political drama that explores the mysteries of the Washington scandal that erupted in 2003 shortly after the start of the Iraq war. Since Doug Limans direction is astute the acting is first-rate the script--by Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth--is smart and the story is an important one its also mysterious that the film is less than the sum of its well-crafted parts. Part of the answer lies in the storys peculiar nature. Anyone who saw ""All the Presidents Men"" let alone read the book or lived through the period can tell you what it was about--a pair of reporters whose revelations helped to topple Richard Nixons presidency. The same clarity cant be found in the source material for ""Fair Game"" which was based on the book of the same name by Ms. Plame and ""The Politics of Truth"" by Mr. Wilson. Theirs is an ambiguous tale of intrigue and betrayal culminating in her being outed as a CIA agent thanks to White House leaks that were widely seen as revenge against Mr. Wilson. (A former ambassador and career diplomat he had written a New York Times op-ed piece denying the truth of one of the Bush administrations most compelling justifications for invading Iraq.) ENLARGE Naomi Watts as the embattled Valerie Plame in Fair Game. Summit Entertainment More on ""Fair Game"" A Qamp;A with Valerie Plame Wilson and Joe Wilson A Qamp;A with Director Doug Liman ""Fair Game"" has its own chilling power accompanied as it is by a drumbeat about weapons of mass destruction that turned out to be nonexistent. Mr. Liman and his colleagues evoke that tumultuous not-so-long ago time with a documentary style that incorporates TV speeches by President George W. Bush Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (""We dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."") And the co-stars could hardly be better--especially Ms. Watts who must be the most agreeably self-effacing star in todays movie universe. Yet most of the scenes depicting the couples domestic life are borderline-banal and they miniaturize the political drama that plays out partly in public partly in the shadows but almost always in a middle distance just beyond emotional reach. Due Date Watch a clip from the film ""Due Date"" starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. Courtesy Warner Bros. Todd Phillips who put himself on the comedy map by directing ""The Hangover"" is back with ""Due Date"" a road movie with mismatched buddies played by Zach Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. Mr. Galifianakis was endearing as well as hilarious in ""The Hangover"" but Ethan the extravagantly fey goofball he plays this time soon wears thin--chubby but thin. Mr. Downey can turn anything into a laugh line but the character he plays here a father-to-be named Peter whos trying to get home in time for his childs birth is little more than a foil for his co-stars antics--a foil both angry and dull. ENLARGE Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis as mismatched road-trippers in Due Date. Warner Bros. Pictures The basic problem is the script which is credited to three writers plus the director--seldom a good sign. Never mind that its a retread of ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles"" minus the trains and minus John Candy. Retreads can hold the road but this one doesnt despite some sporadically funny stuff. What for example are we to make of Ethan confronted for the first time by the Grand Canyon saying ""I couldve sworn I read it was man-made""? Or mistaking Mexico for Texaco after getting himself and Peter high on cannabis clouds in the confines of their car? Jokes like these leave you yearning for less. Four Lions This media-obsessed comedy set in London and directed by Christopher Morris  is an adolescent stab at a grown-up subject. Its The Gang That Couldnt Bomb Straight a boob quartet of Islamic extremists--three Muslims by birth and a kind of soccer hooligan turned nutjob jihadist. (In a twist of whimsy offered as irony another young Muslim who comes on as a fanatic proves to be a passionate pacifist.) Mr. Morris and his writers--four of them in this film as well--like to torture logic with absurdist dialogue and some of their gangs escapades are amusing rather than laughable. Yet ""Four Lions"" lacks a moral base. If the terrorists are hapless clowns the cops are silly fools and the closest the movie comes to political satire is the terrorists penchant for videotaping themselves. The only reason to see it is Riz Ahmeds performance as Omar the supposed brains of the operation. Mr. Ahmed reminded me a bit of Robert Carlyle. Hes dynamic quick-tongued and intense. And much too classy for this tatty room. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Date Night (2010) ENLARGE James Francos breakthrough on the small screen came with a starring role in ""Freaks and Geeks."" On the big screen of course he came to prominence in the ""Spider-Man"" movies as Harry Osborn Peter Parkers best friend and the son of Spideys arch-enemy. In keeping with his unbedazzled attitude toward acting he has also played a wide range of lesser roles. In this comedy about the superbly absurd adventures of a suburban couple played by Steve Carell and Tina Fey Mr. Franco and Mila Kunis are a low-life duo named Taste and Whippit. Go (1999) Before Doug Liman directed ""The Bourne Identity"" he did this piquant bouillabaisse of nihilist comedy. Always leaping before they look the barely postadolescent blunderers of ""Go"" keep suffering dire consequences from dimly perceived causes. They may be many things--spontaneous irrepressible and pretty funny--but they arent poster children for impulse control. The prime mover is an 18-year-old supermarket clerk named Ronna (Sarah Polley deftly deadpan all the way). John August wrote the script set in Los Angeles and Las Vegas on the day before Christmas. Mr. Liman did his own cinematography as he did in ""Fair Game."" Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958) This leisurely sweet-spirited Italian comedy directed by Mario Monicelli was conceived as a spoof of the now-classic ""Rififi"" a mesmerizing French-language heist film directed three years earlier by the American Jules Dassin that created the template for decades of heist films to come. Mr. Monicellis take-off in its turn became the granddaddy of movies about bumbling thieves. The marvelous cast includes Marcello Mastroianni Vittorio Gassman Renato Salvatori and as a once-crackerjack safecracker closing in on senility the legendary clown Toto. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Photo courtesy of Warner ... more Photo Warner Bros. Due Date review More irritating than amusing 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Due Date Comedy. Starring Zach Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. Directed by Todd Phillips. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Until now Todd Phillips has only made funny movies. Sometimes theyre funny but lightweight (""Road Trip"") sometimes hysterical yet tedious (""Old School"") and sometimes theyve contained the biggest laughs of any comedy that year (""Starsky amp; Hutch"" ""The Hangover""). But one thing has been a given. If Todd Phillips directed it you will laugh. Actually two things have been a given Phillips is not about formula. Hes about taking formulas and blowing them up making comedies that violate expectations by being more honest even if that means being more nasty. And its on this second score that the new movie ""Due Date"" fails utterly. It has laughs. Take any scene at random and it will probably have something mildly funny in it. But the comedy never really takes off because its phony. Two strangers an Annoying Guy (Zach Galifianakis) and an Angry Guy (Robert Downey Jr.) are thrown together on a cross-country trip and what do you think happens? Do you think as in ""Midnight Run"" and ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles"" the guys might oh I dunno get to like each other over the course of the journey? This is where the collision comes between Phillips comic sensibility and creaky movie formula Phillips puts his stamp on ""Due Date"" by making the annoying guy into an epic idiot with disgusting personal habits. In one scene forced to sleep in a car with another passenger he starts masturbating with the other guy sitting 2 feet away. And in the backseat his dog starts masturbating too. Actually this is not particularly funny just borderline revolting. Yet confined within a buddy-movie formula Phillips cant resolve ""Due Date"" by having the guys loathe each other so something has to give Either the characters as he conceived them or the formula itself. He decides to alter neither but rather to choose a path that he has never taken before a path blazed by comic mediocrities since time immemorial He distorts the characters. He fudges. He shoehorns their emotions into an accepted standard pattern. In essence he chooses to lie about human nature and in the process loses all access to honest laughs. As for the actors Galifianakis is as funny as he can be working with bad material which means no surprise that hes not that funny. He is game though. Downey has the harder work trying to juggle his characters unfathomable and unjustified attitudinal shifts over the course of the action. Downey is Downey of course so he can manage it but its the waste of an actor. A more unalloyed pleasure is the cameo of Juliette Lewis as a drug dealer. Theres one thing ""Due Date"" simply cant overcome. Its central premise is more irritating than amusing Downey plays an architect flying back to Los Angeles to be present at the birth of his child but an onboard dispute with a colossal imbecile gets him thrown off the plane and onto the no-fly list. Then circumstances force him to have to endure the idiots company on a cross-country drive. Its an insult to the audience that Phillips should take this setup and then try to milk it for sentimental value. Its a betrayal of his previous work which like it or not has always had integrity. I dont believe Phillips got into the movie business to make this decades equivalents of bad Chevy Chase movies. He must never do this again. -- Advisory Gross-out humor strong language.

Pictures Zach Galifianakis (left) and Robert Downey Jr. in ""Due Date"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) and Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) are unlikely traveling companions. Peter is combative and smart-alecky; Ethan is warm and spacey. Peter dresses fashionably; Ethan is definitely off-the-rack. Peter is determined to make it to Los Angeles in time for the birth of his first child; Ethan is bound for Hollywood to pursue an acting career.But before they reach the end of the road theyll be forced to deal with quite a few setbacks. When Steve Martin and John Candy made this film it was called ""Planes Trains and Automobiles."" And it was a lot funnier.""Due Date"" starts out on the highway to brilliance but about halfway through takes a detour into mediocrity. Its the latest comedy from director Todd Phillips whose previous film ""The Hangover"" was among the best of 2009. Working from a screenplay credited to four writers Phillips strives to reproduce the irreverent ""Hangover"" vibe. And the best bits in ""Due Date"" -- involving a small boy who taunts Peter once too often and a dog that commits an unmentionable act -- stand out for their sheer audacity. But Phillips seriously misjudges the laugh potential of graphic violence. Downey and Galifianakis have such terrific chemistry that they generate comedy where it has no right to exist. After some bumpy going Downeys career is back on track with the ""Iron Man"" films and ""Sherlock Holmes"" confirming his box-office appeal. In ""Due Date"" he does little more than trot out his usual acerbic shtick but that should be fine with his fans.Galifianakis who broke through to star status in ""The Hangover"" has found a shtick of his own the bearded slacker whos up for anything. As Ethan hes endearingly clueless.

Hes one of our great male actors not to mention the rare pleasing celebrity who has overcome his most destructive impulses. Also hes only getting better looking with age. But can you still love him when hes spitting in the face of a dog or sucker-punching a waifish child? (See TIMEs Fall Arts Guide.) Downey plays Peter Highman an architect from Los Angeles paired Planes Trains amp; Automobiles-style with a needy foolish completely uncool aspiring actor named Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis). While Peter is slightly more socially savvy than Larry Davids character on Curb Your Enthusiasm hes cut from the same intolerant cloth. He and Ethan first bump into each other at the airport in Atlanta. Both are bound for Los Angeles Ethan to make it in Hollywood and Peter to be at his wife Sarahs (Michelle Monaghan) side for the birth of their first child hence the films title. After various mishaps involving airport security the duo ends up in a small rental car together headed across country. (See the Top 10 comeback movies.) Playing someone humorless is an unusual position for Downey; depriving him of the quick-witted quip out of the corner of his smirking mouth is like telling Denzel Washington to cool it already with the smooth charm. Downeys tendency has always been to try to win an audience over whether the script requires it or not but he doesnt do that here. His Peter is a crisply executed character a man on a tight fuse and I admire the portrayal even though theres no way Id want to drive across country with him. Thats not to say Ethan is exactly a treat either. His greatest aspiration is to be on Two and a Half Men (one of the movies better jokes). Hes vain offensive and so ignorant that he doesnt even realize when hes saying something anti-Semitic. His habits range from disgusting (masturbating himself to sleep) to dangerous (smoking dope at the wheel). Essentially hes Calamity Jack and the movie is actually less Planes Trains amp; Automobiles than Guns Beatings amp; Car Wrecks. Galifianakis gives Ethan various little touches (a lapdog a perm Capezio dance flats) that make you think we might be headed into an examination of Peters hidden homophobic tendencies but that never blossoms into anything. Ethans also a connoisseur of medical marijuana (for his ""glaucoma"") which supplies the motivation for a side trip in Louisiana to replenish his stash and gives Phillips (whose first feature film was Road Trip) and his three other credited screenwriters a chance to get a cheap laugh by having a character played by Robert Downey Jr. declare that he has never done drugs a day in his life. The dude movie genre has become as tediously dependent on drug scenes as chick flicks are on shopping montages. At least in this one we get the treat of Juliette Lewis brief appearance as a slovenly dealer (and the mother of the kid Peter punches). She doesnt get to do much but even 20 seconds of her bantering with Downey is better than nothing. This is the kind of movie you should never see twice because so much of it is based in appall-me humor. Meaning youll laugh the first time in the reflexive way you do when you cant believe how audacious the comedy is and how uncomfortable the situations are whereas a second viewing would afford you an opportunity to feel kind of rotten about laughing the first time. Or question how funny a masturbating dog really is. For all its supposed comedy theres very little joy in Due Date. I say that as someone who happily rolled with the stupidity in Phillips previous efforts Old School and School for Scoundrels. His 2008 blockbuster The Hangover which gave Galifianakis his breakout role was at least twice as funny -- and while it had a nasty edge too that nastiness never felt so personal. Nor did that weekend in Vegas feel interminable as this days-long car trip does. (See a photo brief history of bro culture.) Maybe the difference is that The Hangover didnt have any goals beyond making us laugh. It was about male friendship too but the friendships posed no dramatic challenges; the guys in that movie just were oafish and entertaining. With Due Date road trip movie precedent tells us that buttoned up Peter will come to appreciate unbuttoned Ethan. But having supplied us with plenty of evidence of the darkness within Peter and Ethans remarkable ability to drive anyone crazy its hard to believe that weve truly seen the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

Now Hangover director Todd Phillips has moved Galifianakis front and center opposite straight man Robert Downey Jr. in the new road comedy Due Date. The blame may not rest entirely on the funnymans shoulders but the shift from secret weapon to leading man hits a few unfortunate speed bumps along the way. Movie Information Due DateRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Todd PhillipsStarring Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis Michelle Monaghan Jamie Foxx and Danny McBrideRun time 95 minutesMPAA rating R (language drugs sexual content)Synopsis Expectant dad Robert Downey Jr. is forced to take a road trip with Zach Galifianakis. Things go wrong.Video Chris Vognar in The Screening Room Due DateMore movies from GuideLive.comThe task is pretty simple for Galifianakis who plays a wannabe actor named Ethan Tremblay Fill an impious naive passenger from hell with enough quirks to give Downeys straight man plenty of cause for reaction.The two meet cute at the Atlanta airport where an unlikely chain of events lands Downeys Peter on a no-fly list and in Ethans rental car for a cross-country drive to Los Angeles where Peters wife (Michelle Monaghan barely used) is expecting a baby and Ethan hopes to make it in showbiz. (Galifianakis various head shots are a scream.) The pairing is pure comedy contrivance a quickie way to get two stars in the same screen space regardless of story holes.Due Date is a modern change-up on the old screwball comedy formula. In the days of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant the idea was to have a free-spirited gal knock an uptight guys world for a loop. Here we have Galifianakis with an effeminate prance and a cute pug dog driving Downeys architect to the brink of madness. Both characters have tenuous connections to other people - Peter will be a first-time daddy; Ethan carries his fathers ashes in a coffee can - but the movie lives and dies with their bond.Because this is a Phillips movie we get scenes of both dog and owner masturbating a bong load of pot humor and a stream of casual hit-and-miss sadism that like a carton of milk left on the counter turns a little sour after a while. Phillips strength - a willingness to push content toward the big belly laugh - also can be his weakness when he veers into meanness. Then again your idea of fun might just be Danny McBride as a vet in a wheelchair going to work on Downey with a blackjack.Galifianakis vulnerability and Downeys professionalism keep Due Date from doing a crash and burn. Galifianakis is one of those performers with no apparent filter to divide the person from the shtick. He may not really be a hairy sensitive man-child but everything he does feels spontaneous. Downey now a bona fide movie star was a fine actor first and without his grounding Due Date might be unbearable. Instead its merely overbearing a little stale and given the pedigree disappointing.Follow Chris Vognar on twitter chrisvognar. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Due Date Downey delivers in formula road movie | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDue Date Downey delivers in formula road movieThe surprisingly roadworthy comedy Due Date overcomes formula thanks to the canny casting of Robert Downey Jr.Downey right saves Due Date from being just another movie with Galifianakis as a weirdo.  (Melinda Sue Gordon / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 4 2010 Due Date (out of 4) Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. Directed by Todd Phillips. 95 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Stop me if youve heard this one -- and you definitely have. An uptight man trying to cross the U.S. on a deadline is forced to share the journey with an annoying eccentric. Hilarity ensues. Its the stuff of nearly every road movie as Due Date director Todd Phillips well knows -- he made Road Trip and last years Vegas-bound laugher The Hangover. He didnt make Planes Trains and Automobiles or Rain Man but hes seen them as have we all. The only real variable is the hilarity part which doesnt always ensue as planned. How do you make formula funny? Therein lies Phillipss hard labour with Due Date which has the added cramp of Zach Galifianakis in the role of the annoying eccentric. Since his breakthrough with The Hangover Galifianakis has been almost constantly on the comedy screen playing essentially the same loon over and over. Can we possibly stand yet another movie on the same tired theme? But hes just one part of this surprisingly road-worthy comedy. Phillips has Robert Downey Jr. for the uptight guy and theres a certain brilliance to this given Downeys riotous lifestyle in years gone by. Hes such a fine actor hes able to deliver the line ""Ive never done drugs in my life"" with a completely straight face. Watching Downeys vein-popping discomfiture in the company of Galifianakis is the best and possibly only reason for seeing the film. Downeys Peter Highman an L.A. architect and impending dad-to-be makes his ""no drugs"" declaration to an Atlanta airport security checker near the start of this adventure in insanity. The bag contradicts him of course and the second funniest thing about the encounter is that the screener is played by rapper RZA who like Downey knows a thing or two about using festive pharmaceuticals. Peter has been left holding the bag that belongs to Galifianakiss Ethan Tremblay an actor wannabe who literally ran into him outside the airport. Things rapidly go downhill -- and not up in the air. To Peters increasing fury and Ethans blissed-out pleasure the two end up on a no-fly list. Against all logic they share a rental car on the long road to L.A. They have to make it there by Friday just a few days away because Peters wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) is due that day for a C-section to deliver their baby. Peter is determined not to miss this grand event. Eager Ethan is just as determined to get him there but a few sidetrips will have to be made along the way involving dippy drug dealers an angry ex-soldier meddlesome Mexican border guards pursuing policemen inconvenient road crews and a suspiciously helpful friend. Cue fun cameos. Oh theres also a masturbating dog. Nuff said about that but its the films biggest laugh. It all works better than could be expected given that any movie with Galifianakis playing a weirdo should be titled Past Due Date. But his Ethan does provide a good tagline for the film ""Lifes weird isnt it? Buckle up.""

(Warner Bros) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday November 4 2010 209 PM Title Due Date An uptight architect and a needy actor are forced to take a road trip together. With Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (140). Rated R Language drug use violence sexuality. At area theaters.Those hoping for another ""Hangover"" may be disappointed by Todd Phillips punch-drunk followup which is basically ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" for the road-rage generation.Robert Downey Jr. is simmering straight man Peter an architect whos on edge from the moment he meets Zach Galifianakiss flaky Ethan at the Atlanta airport. Peter is heading home to L.A. for the impending birth of his child while aspiring actor Ethan is determined to guest-star on his favorite show ""Two and a Half Men.""Ethans antics get them both kicked off the plane though Peters wallet remains on board. If he wants to get to California before his wife goes into labor hell have to hitch a ride with Ethan. Peters already fighting to keep his temper in check but he has no idea how bad things are going to get.There are several laughs along the way often courtesy of cameos from the likes of RZA Danny McBride and Jamie Foxx. (Michelle Monaghan is given virtually nothing to do as Peters pregnant wife.) And a couple of the set pieces like the guys disastrous detour into Mexico are close to inspired.But youll need a far higher tolerance lever than Peter if youre going to make it all the way across the country with the obscenely irritating Ethan.Galifianakis does make an effort to find Ethans vulnerable side but Phillips prefers to keep it hidden beneath grating tics and obvious jokes (he wears a Lilith Fair T-shirt and couldnt be prouder of his recent perm).While Galifianakis commits to the absurdity with impressive dedication Downey seems atypically uncomfortable through most of the movie. Honestly its hard to blame him. Like the direction the script -- written by Phillips and three others -- veers all over the place before reaching its inevitable unsurprising destination.

ABOUT THE MOVIEDue Date  1/2 (out of four)Stars Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis Michelle Monaghan Jamie Foxx Juliette LewisDirector Todd PhillipsDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for language drug use and sexual contentRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Due Date is more a matter of chemistry than deadlines. The grudging bond that develops between Robert Downey Jr.s uptight architect and Zach Galifianakis slovenly wannabe actor in this buddy/road trip comedy fires on most cylinders. If not for the sharp comic timing and quirky appeal of Downey and Galifianakis this might feel like a raunchy re-tread of Planes Trains and Automobiles striving for Hangover status. INTERVIEW Director Phillips has another date with the guys TRAILER Get a peek at Due Date As directed by The Hangovers Todd Phillips the initial unexpected encounter between the duo sets the comic tone. From there the humor gains traction as the plot gathers holes. The comic vibe is familiar slapstick stoner and gross-out gags including a self-pleasuring bulldog. Less effective is male bonding mushiness that only Judd Apatow seems to pull off skillfully. Downey plays Peter a high-handed guy whose wife (Michelle Monaghan) is about to have a baby. Hes headed home to Los Angeles after a business trip to Atlanta. But as bad luck would have it Peter collides with goony Ethan (Galifianakis). Disbelief must be suspended when Peter makes it through airport security in inadvertent possession of Ethans marijuana (allegedly for his glaucoma). As Peter Downey insists ""Ive never done drugs in my life"" a line that is all the funnier given Downeys past. Officials confiscate the drug Peter is allowed to board the flight. But after an onboard ruckus involving Ethans protruding hairy belly he and Ethan are tossed off and onto the no-fly list. Peter now must make the cross-country trip by car to arrive in time to see his baby born. But thanks to more contrived shenanigans he has no credit card to rent a car. Ethan however manages to get a rental car and the next thing you know the two are sharing the front seat. A pit stop in Alabama where Ethan replenishes his er glaucoma meds is one of the movies funnier bits. Ethan is grieving the recent death of his dad whose ashes he carries around in a coffee can. The resulting gag is funnier than might be expected. Scenes involving a brush with Mexican border officials go on too long. And the pairs careening escape would surely have led to a manhunt. Still when officials accuse them of trying to enter the country illegally Downeys Peter sardonically insists ""Ive never heard of anyone trying to sneak into Mexico."" Its Downeys signature sarcasm and distinctive slow burn that make the movie. Galifianakis in a perm that makes for comic gold plays an expanded version of his Hangover character. The bawdy shenanigans dont always pay off but the comic mayhem is enhanced by Due Dates offbeat coupling.

"Movie review Due Date - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-TrainsMovie review Due DateTraveling without moving. Thats what happens with this road-trip tale from The Hangovers director. Its all about humor (oh that it were actually funny) not plot characterization or taste.November 05 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic John Hughes did it better. I say that because it is nearly impossible to watch ""Due Date"" the new comedy from ""The Hangover"" filmmaking phenom Todd Phillips and not be hit by a wave of nostalgia for the far better ""Planes Trains and Automobiles."" Since Phillips and crew never mention ""Planes Trains etc."" as either inspiration or reference point I can only assume they either missed it a although with cable and all kinds of handy film reference guides that hardly seems possible a or theyre counting on the generational divide to keep comparisons at bay. Fat chance. Since there is no train on this road trip starring Zach Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. as strangers thrown together by happenstance and a Homeland Security infraction theres more auto action much of it the monster-truck-rally sort. Still at times it feels as if little more than the names have been changed. This is a disappointing turn coming from Phillips particularly since ""The Hangover"" was such a fresh bracing brew of black comic fun. Granted its tough to hit it out of the park when youre starting with such a familiar premise (though remakes sequels and the like are a bad habit that Hollywood in general cant seem to break). Or maybe Phillips would argue hes just repeating himself doing a more grown-up version of his first feature film 2000s ""Road Trip"" which had some of the frat-house vibe he perfected quite nicely a few years later in ""Old School."" Whatever the starting point screenwriters Alan R. Cohen amp; Alan Freedland and Adam Sztykiel amp; Phillips never quite pull it off here as our mismatched pair fight and fuss their way from Atlanta to Los Angeles. There are laughs yes but the sweetness and soft heart that made the John Candy- Steve Martin Thanksgiving journey all warm and cozy has gone missing. As Ethan Tremblay Galifianakis once again draws the loser card that hes been playing since he sat down at the table last summer in ""The Hangover."" Tremblay is a wannabe actor on his way to Hollywood with scoring pot as his raison dAatre and a vague plan to scatter his dads ashes at the Grand Canyon en route. Hes got a man-perm carries a man-purse and has a French bulldog named Sonny as a sidekick so the character is tailor-made for the comics eccentric brand of humor. His opposite number is Downey as Peter Highman a name that will provide the film its final ""sounds like"" R-rated punch line (with the ""The Hangover"" guys nothing is accidental). That comes right after another gag with racial overtones a so misogyny and racism how funny is that? Peter is an A-type business guy desperate to get home for the birth of his child although honestly if it was your firstborn would you leave town if you didnt have to (he didnt) with your wife only days from delivery? Over the years the usually excellent Downey has made an art out of the arch which gives even the most despicable character he takes on some redeeming qualities. But in ""Due Date"" he struggles to unearth any inner goodness in Peter a tough to do when hes expected to get laughs by spitting at a dog. What fun there is to be found is tied to the friction of the bumps along the way. There are problem people to deal with primarily in the form of an Alabama back-country premium pot-seller played by Juliette Lewis another off-the-grid character of the type shes favoring these days and Jamie Foxx as an ex-football superstar and close friend of Peters perhaps even closer (hint hint) to the pregnant missus ( Michelle Monaghan). There are a lot of ramped-up action bits including a mad dash across the Mexican border that should satisfy any metal-crushing car-chasing fever thanks to director of photography Lawrence Sher (another ""Hangover"" buddy). And there are a series of increasingly serious mishaps with Peter lucky to get away with his life but frankly hes such a pill its tough to care. Downeys dilemma is really what keeps tripping up the entire film. A movie like this isnt just about getting from Point A to Point B; it should also be about the journey a as in how do these characters evolve? Peter and Ethan have plenty of ""ha-ha"" moments but there are no ""ahas"" to be found. When the trip finally ends you find they really havent gone anywhere at all. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review ApplauseJanuary 21 2011Toy Story 3s main Oscar rivalsDecember 7 2010Blind Side director John Lee Hancock is out of movie jailNovember 24 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTTrainsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-due-date-20101105,0,5713180.story",200,duedate19,duedate,latimes

Melinda Sue Gordon Road trip odd couple Zach Galifianakis as Ethan and Robert Downey Jr. as Peter in ""Due Date."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Due Date"" like its spiritual predecessor ""The Hangover"" is a weird emulsion of comedy and torture porn. Human Muppet Zach Galifianakis is Ethan an oblivious airhead with dreams of Hollywood acting glory. Master thespian Robert Downey Jr. is Peter a high-strung businessman en route to L.A. for the birth of his first child. When they are forcibly de-planed in Atlanta they share Ethans rental car with Peter being tormented at every turn. A diagram of the films plot would go like this Stun gun obnoxious kid sexual impropriety sexual impropriety involving dog car wreck broken arm crematorium-remains coffee psychological harassment handcuffs gunshot wound. These high jinks could go just as easily in a ""Saw"" or ""Jackass"" movie. The distinction here is the cast. Downey plays the long-suffering Peter with a completely inappropriate degree of conviction. His carefully suppressed irritability comes leaking out first in a steady trickle of sarcasm then in geysers of retaliatory abuse. Ethan ruins Peters life with full deniability; its always an idiot mistake. Peters counterstrikes are premeditated. Yet Ethan a stoner nincompoop always forgives his new buddy. If you dont see that Peter is on the path to learning some life lessons you have never seen a movie before. For a road movie ""Due Date"" generates hardly any momentum. Juliette Lewis and Danny McBride pop up director Todd Phillips makes his compulsory cameo appearance and Jamie Foxx zips in and out in a minimalist cameo as the movie slows to a crawl. The slack episodic pace gives us time to reflect on the fact that weve seen almost every joke in the film elsewhere. DUE DATE  out of 4 stars Rating R for drug use language and sexual content. The pinnacle of the verbal humor comes when Peter asks Ethan why he carries his fathers ashes with him in a coffee can. ""Because hes dead"" comes the reply. By reuniting with ""Hangovers"" star Galifianakis Phillips may have thought he could recapture the magic. Instead he created a low-grade migraine.

It is the first collision in a film boasting coast-to-coast vehicular totaling.When architect and anarchist are booted from their flight they embark on a rude road trip of the sort that takes many turnoffs from the highway of funny-ha-ha to the dirt roads of funny-ouch.And theyre on a tight schedule. Peter needs to get to Los Angeles in four days for the birth of his son by scheduled C-section. With wallet stowed in his bag on the plane Peter depends on the kindness of the very strange stranger a fey narcoleptic with glaucoma a stash of medical marijuana and less concept of cause and effect than a newborn.In this film written by a tag team of four scribes the basic premise is that if you want to make God - or anyone else - laugh make a plan. Plans like Peters carefully thought-out itinerary never take into account those necessary detours to rest stops drug dealers and border crossings.Playing to type as Ethan Galifianakis the ginger-bearded bear of a boy who shot to fame as the odd-duck brother of the bride in The Hangover is funny not because he is boorish but because he is immune to embarrassment. Playing against type as Peter arbiter of appropriateness Downey is funny because in spite of his characters carefully managed rage he loses control at the most inappropriate times.I winced more than laughed at this movie which has almost as many broken bones as punch lines. But there is something comically symmetrical about Downey as an expectant dad rehearsing fatherhood with the overgrown boy and Galifianakis as the fatherless son who adopts Downey as his surrogate dad.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Due Date is a rather pat occasionally desperate road comedy with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. Downey plays Peter a short-tempered snobby architect whos thrown off an Atlanta flight to Los Angeles when he and a fellow passenger -- obnoxious aspiring-actor Ethan (Galifianakis) -- are mistaken for terrorists. Theyre placed on the no-fly list and forced to drive to Southern California fast enough for Peter to see his wife (Michelle Monaghan) deliver their baby and for Ethan whos about 40 to start an acting career.As is the way with such comedies these two are oil and water. Peter appears to loathe Ethan. Ethan feels otherwise. But as the miles pass they mix anyway.I didnt believe this movie. Which is not the same as saying I didnt like it -- although there is that. Only about a quarter of the movies gags and shtick really work often when other actors like Juliette Lewis Danny McBride and Jamie Foxx pitch in for a scene or two. What I didnt believe is that Peters wife wouldnt simply have found a less elaborate way to get him home. Had a scene been written in which he actually explains to her the preposterousness of his situation the entire film would last 15 minutes.The most interesting thing about ""Due Date is how deluded it is. This is a comedy of misunderstanding. The best scene happens early when Peter and an airport security agent (RZA hip-hops drollest comedian) squabble over what a terrorist seems like. The movie keeps finding ways to tweak misperceptions about race class patriotism and paternity always at Peters expense. Why couldnt those same misapprehensions be turned on Peter and Ethans relationship?In the opening minutes at the airport Peter and Ethan make eye contact. Not just any eye contact but the sort of prolonged stare that Kathleen Turner might have given to William Hurt at some point in ""Body Heat. Its not arousing but its not completely empty either. Though it could be that the meaning of such an exchange has changed given how frequently it happens now between ostensibly straight men from ""Pineapple Express to almost anything with Paul Rudd the vocabulary has certainly not. It signifies attraction.Todd Phillips directed and cowrote ""Due Date and in the past hes had good ideas about how men relate to each other -- through midlife-crisis nostalgia (""Old School) or post-hedonistic rue (""The Hangover) -- even if the circumstances strained credibility. The relationships had a whiff of authenticity. This new movie seems afraid of the many perverse avenues down which it could traipse.Ethan has a perm somewhere between Richard Simmons and the quip writer Bruce Vilanch. He says he wants to go to Hollywood but everything about him including the hairbrush that sticks out of his back pocket suggests hes already there as a salon stylist on ""Shear Genius.""Due Date actually goes out of its way to pull our legs. Ethan mentions sex hes had with a woman. He thinks Shakespeare is a pirate. He wants to star on ""Two and a Half Men. And hes an idiot stoner (the smoke screen is literal). When Ethan (and his French bulldog) masturbate its alongside an appalled Downey -- not with at or toward him.Playing a specific human -- even a stereotype -- might give Galifianakiss comedy some focus. Instead this is another of his off-the-rack eccentrics that he merely threatens to redecorate. Downey for his part actually goes out of his way to tone down his usual swishiness. This is the straightest acting hes done in years. And yet amid the car crashes and vomiting and weed jokes you wonder whether Phillipss movie is a closet case. Hes made ""Buddy Heat.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Share Tweet Its a long way from Atlanta to Los Angeles and its longer still without identification money or the legal ability to board a plane and with the forced company of a man whose nonstop chatter includes a boast about having 90 friends on Facebook 12 of them pending. But when deadlines loom you do what you have to do as Robert Downey Jr. discovers in Due Date. A successful tightly wound architect working away from his expectant wife (Michelle Monaghan) mere days before her scheduled C-section Downey winds up sharing a rental car with Zach Galifianakis who plays an aspiring actor of dubious talent eager to make it in Hollywood after the death of his beloved father. Well not so eager that he cant make their first stop a side trip to buy some weed. So begins a rambling cross-country journey that makes a lot of familiar buddy-movie stops along the way but seldom suffers for it. Directing with more focus-- and eventually more heart--than he brought to The Hangover Todd Phillips smartly lets his leads chemistry power the movie. First seen wearing a Bluetooth headset to bed Downeys character might have been a cliche of uptightdom in other hands but Downey makes him a volatile bundle of anger and familial concern kept from exploding only by his desire to see the birth of his child. Galifianakis on the other hand keeps his character interesting by refusing to define what type of weirdo hes playing. His mere appearance is a contradiction A burly man with an effete sashay and soulful (though glassy) eyes his character lives on the tissue-thin line dividing helpless naivete from the disarming confidence of someone who decided he was fine being a misfit long ago. Phillips throws in at least one screaming-and-driving scene too many--are funny car chases ever really that funny?--but the film keeps finding memorable comic moments between scenes that develop a strange real bond between the two men. The situations sometimes feel contrived but the characters never do particularly because Galifianakis remains simultaneously charming and unrelentingly irritating. Its easy to believe Downey would come to feel for the guy equally easy to understand why hed want to throttle him with Galifianakis ever-present scarf. And the film benefits--both comically and emotionally--from leaving both possibilities look equally likely almost to the end.

This odd-couple comedy reunites Galifianakis with Todd Phillips who directed The Hangover but dont expect anything like the other movies novel plotting or wild slapstick. Phillips has already directed one road comedy--the hilariously stupid Road Trip (2000)--and this is weak tea by comparison.

There are infinite permutations in the premise of an odd couple stuck on a long road trip and the combination of Robert Downey Jr. as a straight-laced architect and Zach Galifianakis as a pothead aspiring actor with a propensity for horrendous accidents (and hairstyles) is inspired. The actors are fine Its their long arduous trek that lets the movie down. Peter (Downey) and Ethan (Galifianakis) meet in disastrous fashion at the Atlanta airport where they happen to share a flight to Los Angeles. Peter is rushing home for the birth of his child due by C-section in three days while Ethan dreams of landing a recurring spot on the TV sitcom Two and a Half Men. A series of amusingly contrived incidents later both are kicked off the plane and placed in a no-fly zone and Peter leaves his wallet in his luggage leaving him at the mercy of the friendly exceptionally eccentric Ethan who has a rental car and offers him a ride. Director Todd Phillips coming off the most successful R-rated comedy in history (The Hangover) takes some surprisingly caustic turns with his Felix-Oscar scenario. Downey plays Peter as an intolerant jerk who does not suffer indignity easily. Commonly cast as a suave and likable wise guy he is like a dark version of Steve Martins harried businessman in Planes - capable of punching an annoying 8-year-old in the stomach or spitting in the face of an adorable pug. Meanness suits him. Galifianakis doing another variation of his bizarre man-child persona serves the same purpose John Candy did in Planes His highly annoying habits and curious tics are a front for his profound loneliness after the death of his father. Ethan is carrying his dads ashes in a can a device that results in the movies biggest laugh but also allows a growing streak of sentimentality to creep into the proceedings. The picture zigzags among bits of surreal humor (including a hilarious sequence set to Pink Floyds Hey You in which Pete and Ethan get really really high) comic action and car crashes reminiscent of vintage John Landis and tender moments in which Peter gradually learns to see past Ethans obnoxious shell. Whats missing is a compelling plotline to make this trip seem less of a drag. The movie starts to feel mighty long after the pair has a protracted faceoff with authorities at the U.S.-Mexico border. Soon you cant wait for them to get to L.A. Road pictures such as Midnight Run worked well because the characters were so much fun to spend time with no matter where the road took them. In Due Date Downey and Galifianakis are game but you wouldnt want to ride shotgun with them. Cast Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis Michelle Monaghan Jamie Foxx Juliette Lewis Danny McBride RZA.

Due Date Fair Director Todd Phillips. Cast Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis Michelle Monaghan. Rating Rated R for language drug use and sexual content. Downey Galifianakis hit the road Spotlight Robert Downey Jr. Goofy buddy movies | Pregnancy flicks To relate to the film we must believe that a worldly smart man could somehow get stuck driving across the country with a clueless nut case so he can make it to LA in time for the birth of his first child. OK its a movie there are bigger stretches. But we also have to buy that the two men could not only survive a spectacular car crash but walk away with only a broken arm and a few broken ribs to show for it. Again maybe it could happen whatever. And the same goes for the unappetizing misuse of the cremated remains of a characters father the ridiculous escape from Mexico (long story) and what the heck the self-pleasuring secret to a good nights sleep. But when Phillips expects us to believe that Robert Downey Jr.s architect would not only stick with Zach Galifianakis pathetic would-be actor not strangle him but bond with him and grow to genuinely care for the guy during the course of this trip well sorry but thats a bridge too far. ""Due Date"" is Phillips follow-up to ""The Hangover"" the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time. But it simply isnt as consistent as funny as good as his blockbuster. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments including a unique approach to child care and Downey and Galifianakis are game to try just about anything. The problem is Phillips asks them to do everything making for an inconsistency of tone that undercuts the movie. Sight gags slapstick stoner riffs the occasional moment of sincerity - all here. If youre thinking that the only thing missing is a cute dog well hes here too. Downey plays Peter Highman who is on a business trip in Atlanta. His wife (Michelle Monaghan) is scheduled to give birth by C-section at the end of the week. No problem as Peter is flying out. Until fate and bad driving bring him together with Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) that is. Before you can say ""contrived plot device"" Ethans social ineptitude and large belly have combined to land both him and Peter on the no-fly list. So theyll have to make the trip by car. Without his wallet - hes told that his bags wallet inside are still on the flight he was kicked off of - Peter has no choice but to catch a ride with Ethan. Of course he actually has many other choices none of which would make for a movie. So off they go with side trips that include scoring some medical marijuana for Ethans glaucoma wink wink cough cough which thanks to some funny casting and Peters aforementioned unconventional ideas about disciplining unruly children offers some of the films biggest laughs. ""Due Date"" should be a disaster derivative of every road-trip movie youve ever seen. What prevents that are the efforts of the two stars. Downey is simply a fascinating actor; whether hes talking to a coffee can wondering whether hes gotten stoned on second-hand smoke or being beaten up by a disabled veteran he brings something fresh and unique to the scene. Meanwhile Galifianakis with an innate sweetness showed greater range in ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" than the not-all-there good-time guy he often plays. He brings some of that to this film as well in the scenes where hes working out his grief over his fathers death. Theyre just an odd fit in an already crowded mix.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr TWO MEN AND A LITTLE PUPPY Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis cross the country the hard way in Due Date (Melinda Sue Gordon) B- Due Date Genre Comedy; Starring Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis; Director Todd Phillips; Release Date Wide 11/05/2010; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted November 3 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT There are those who can take the trippy oblivious big-bearded man-baby humor of Zach Galifianakis only in small doses -- an SNL sketch here an online episode of Between Two Ferns there. Longer exposure leads to itchy discomfort. To them I say dont see Due Date. Because theres a whole lot of cringe-inducing Galifianakis going on in this shaggy buddy caper the latest cavalcade of male mayhem from director Todd Phillips reunited with the production team that whipped up the record-breaking 2009 hit comedy The Hangover. (You remember Galifianakis in that shaggy buddy caper? He was the big-bearded man-baby wearing a smaller smooth-cheeked actual baby strapped to his expansive chest.) Me I find the comedy of aggressive self-involvement liberating at least when done by a skilled practitioner. And the hordes who have happily spent a quarter century in the home of Homer Simpson -- not to mention fans eager for the return of the peerless aggravation of Larry David on Curb Your Enthusiasm -- suggest there are plenty of others who savor the pained hilarity of bad behavior. To them I say go see Due Date. But be prepared on this particular gas-guzzling road trip for potholes and speed bumps of superficial Caring Guy sentiment that derail the movie over the long-distance comic haul. On his latest itinerary the documentary-trained Phillips (who called his 2000 comedy-feature debut well Road Trip) has cast Galifianakis as an Atlanta-based budding thespian. This guy has permed his hair into corkscrew curls and changed his name to the inexplicably silly moniker Ethan Tremblay in anticipation of the middlebrow stardom he hopes to find in Hollywood. His dream job is to work on the infernal sitcom machine that is Two and a Half Men. Instead of an actual baby Ethan totes a French bulldog -- along with his late fathers ashes in a coffee can -- as he prepares for a flight to Los Angeles. Robert Downey Jr. plays Peter Highman (another silly name no?) an architect wound into equally tight corkscrews whos also bound for the same flight from Atlanta home to L.A. Peter is in a hurry because his wife (Michelle Monaghan) is about to give birth to the couples first child. (Aside Its kind of sweet dont you think attaching the title Due Date with its implications of childbirth. An uninformed browser might think there are women involved in the fun. The informed browser on the other hand remembers that the female universe in The Hangover consists of an uninteresting bride-to-be a hateful girlfriend and a nice stripper. Boys rule.) The first fateful encounter between Ethan and Peter turns out to be the best and the best-written portion of Due Date. (Four guys including Phillips share credit for the wildly uneven screenplay -- not counting Galifianakis ad-libs.) A sharply plotted introductory airport snafu showcases Ethans blithe destructive cluelessness and Peters choked supercilious impatience allowing the stars to crank up their distinctive comedic personas to full throttle. It also kick-starts the chain-reaction plot as Ethan and Peter are thrown off their flight and fated by the gods of odd-couple movies to take a rental-car drive west. Anyone who has recently survived the stresses of plane travel will appreciate how easy it is to snap from calm to apoplectic. The unexpected pairing of Galifianakis and Downey is a pleasure -- theyre an unlikely duo so off in their chemistry as to be bizarrely on. At this point in his singular career Downey has shaped his disarming self-aware F-U stare to perfection while Galifianakis has a knack for making his eyes simultaneously convey exasperating insensitivity and exasperating blamelessness. The two men seem to fascinate each other. But Atlanta to L.A. is a long drive during which Phillips cant decide whether to go for the raunchy (lots of masturbation jokes) or the mushy (Ethan really loved his simple old dad but Peter has more conflicting emotions about his). And so by the time the pair admire the Grand Canyon (time for major mush) and then arrive at the hospital where Wifey is in labor (time for mush plus jokes) Due Date has lost its way relying on its leading men to lead by charisma alone even though their characters have nowhere interesting to go besides the happily-ever-after of dull responsible male maturity.

At first they hate each other but after a long series of misunderstandings and misadventures the two reach a grudging acceptance even affection. Yep youve gotta love Planes Trains and Automobiles.To be fair The Hangover director Todd Phillips goes out of his way to distance himself from John Hughess well-liked holiday romp largely by making Due Date a lot louder ruder and more violent. But it doesnt work every time we look at Robert Downey Jrs highly strung Peter we remember how good Steve Martin was in a near-identical role. And every time we meet Zach Galafianakiss masturbating slob Ethan we recall how John Candy managed to be both infuriating and sympathetic without resorting to crude grossout.Phillips also tries to distinguish his film by littering it with cameos some of which work - Danny McBride as an enraged ex-soldier RZA as a stony-faced customs official - but most of which feel underdeveloped Juliette Lewis plays second fiddle to Galafianakis in a scene as a white-trash pot dealer and Jamie Foxx as Downeys best friend walks out of the room midway through a scene and inexplicably never returns.There are some decent laughs scattered throughout Due Date but  Phillips cant find a way to make his two leads likeable they remain obnoxious and ill suited right to the schmaltzy finale. The result is noisy episodic fitfully amusing but forgettable.

I though Trains Planes and Aeroplanes was pretty subtle and funny with two actors who made the most of their lines. But Due Date featured two characters both of whom were repellent in their various ways which made it hard to empathise with either of them. Is the sight of a fat man masturbating in a car funny?

Downey Jr. plays Peter a Bluetoothed architect with a very pregnant wife (Michelle Monaghan) waiting at home for him; Galifianakiss Ethan is a would-be movie star headed to Hollywood with a pocket dog under one arm and a coffee can containing his recently deceased dads ashes under the other. One nonsensical barely explicated altercation later both Peter and Ethan are kicked off the plane and barred from boarding another. Ethan rents a car and offers Peter a cross-country ride which provides a framework for a series of sketches As they make their way across the country this odd couple bickers smokes lots of pot destroys several cars evades border police and works out daddy issues in the process. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In interviews to promote Due Date director Todd Phillips has claimed that the film was intended as a battery-recharging quickie in between the king-making success of The Hangover and the high-pressure assignment of creating a franchise-cementing sequel. The best thing that can be said about Due Date is that it lives up to Phillipss advance billing From a breakneck pace that makes its 95-minute running time fly by to the high-contrast patina of its high-speed Super 35 source stock to a stoner-esque disinterest in Chekhovian payoff thats such a balls-out fuck-you to conventional screenwriting that its sort of exciting Due Date is fast lazy and out of control in a manner thats basically commendable.Which is not to say its cheap Phillips who also directed Starsky amp; Hutch has a thing for extended highly destructive car chases that in their relentless momentum and defiance of real-world consequence almost qualify as surreal. He also likes to hammer home moments of genuine emotion with sweeping crane shots and expensive source cues. Here the productions bloat is at odds with the materials scrappy charm.Due Dates best running gag revolves around Ethans acting ambitions and while Galifianakiss material (written by a team of screenwriters including Phillips) isnt always fresh (Ethans headshot looks a lot like that of Arrested Developments Tobias Funke) its hard to imagine another contemporary comic getting this kind of mileage out of wearing a Lilith Fair T-shirt and gently ribbing Two and a Half Men. As in The Hangover Galifianakiss full commitment to his characters multivalent strangeness his ability to rocket back and forth between laughing stock antagonist and sympathetic hero--sometimes within the space of a single line reading--makes him Due Dates MVP. And unlike Downey and supporting players Jamie Foxx and Danny McBride you never get the sense that Galifianakis the actor is winking at you from behind the character.Last months soggy-sincere indie Its Kind of a Funny Story which cast Galifianakis as a mental patient/ward mentor was supposed to offer the comedian the chance to capital-A Act but hes more convincing as a functional crazy person in Due Date--his performance is the only thing grounding a film that brashly flouts character development and narrative causality. I dont know how long this can last--I dont know how many scenes Galifianakis can steal in big-budget mainstream comedies before his act particularly the self-serious naivete that wont quit until his hardened sidekicks and/or opponents submit to it becomes codified losing its veneer of spontaneity and thus its appeal. But for now his chemistry with Phillips is the filmmakers greatest asset.Due Date like The Hangover before it barrels through increasingly fantastic set pieces on its way to a major grown-up man rite of passage but in this case the journey is divorced from the destination. Downeys Peter has no need for big life lessons Hes kind of an asshole but an asshole whos fully committed to his marriage and impending fatherhood and hes allowed to stay more or less the same asshole throughout his travails. Due Dates reluctance to impose late-inning moral change may just be a function of its lackadaisical construction but its refreshing nonetheless. Blissfully each disaster is solely for the sake of slapstick.1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Karina Longworth Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Daily Edition Login to download Film Review Due Date 1030 PM PDT 10/28/2010 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS It might not be ""The Hangover"" but itll do until the sequel comes along. TWITTER As if in a hangover from ""The Hangover"" ""Due Date"" strives to snatch hilarity from the jaws of desperation with sporadic stumbling success. Todd Phillips follow-up to the most successful R-rated comedy of all time serves up its share of laughs while not actually providing a terribly enjoyable time because of a queasy undercurrent that never goes away. The pairing of live-wire Robert Downey Jr. with the slow-burning Zach Galifianakis strikes enough wild sparks to make this unendearing road trip a potent if not sensational late-fall commercial comedy for Warner Bros. The films comic linchpin also is its greatest liability Galifianakis clueless loser Ethan Tremblay represents a one-man plague carrier of Murphys Law. Disaster accompanies this uncouth wannabe actor everywhere as if its gum stuck to his shoe and woe be to any innocent bystander unlucky enough to land in his path. Youd think Downeys harried and preoccupied architect Peter Highman whose wife is about to give birth in Los Angeles would be smart enough to recognize this after a couple of disruptive collisions with him at the Atlanta airport so theres a degree to which one irrevocably turns against Downeys character when he fails to heed the bright flashing lights and alarm bells warning him that he should take a taxi all the way back to Los Angeles rather than ride with Ethan once the latter has contrived to land him on the no-fly list. ""Due Date"" is patterned as a sort-of ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles"" without the railroad so the viewer like the discomfited Peter whos suddenly missing his luggage I.D. and credit cards must face the prospect of spending a protracted period with this dumpy bearded guy who sports a perm and carries with him a French bulldog and the ashes of his father in a coffee can. Its Oscar and Felix stuck in a car together for three days except for the fact that that the irritation is not mutual but monumentally one-sided; almost nothing phases Ethan especially after he has stocked up on smokable ""glaucoma medication"" courtesy of a trashy home grower (Juliette Lewis). Peter will have none of this claiming ""Ive never done drugs in my life"" a tad too obvious an in-joke coming from the actor in question. Once he grudgingly settles in for the long ride from Georgia to California Peter learns more than he really wants to know about his unwanted companion beginning with Ethans inspiring admission that "" Two and a Half Men is the reason I wanted to be an actor."" Peters frustration triggers its own share of problems -- his pissing off a Western Union clerk (Danny McBride) hes trying to get to help him is a particular highlight -- but by and large Ethan lives up to his promise by cutting a swath of catastrophe along Interstate 20 whether he tries or not. Among his achievements are -- after a pit-stop visit with Peters old pal (Jamie Foxx) -- creating grave doubt that Peter actually is the father of his wifes about-to-be-born child taking a turnoff that leads them over the border into Ciudad Juarez at night and getting Peter high anyway along with the dog when he lights up with all the car windows sealed shut. The laughs come in abrupt bursts but theyre not constant convulsive or contagious; even for the ready and willing ""Due Date"" doesnt begin to rival ""Hangover"" for inventiveness or hilarity. But the sharp comic instincts and contrasting styles of the stars who never are offscreen keep the film alive despite the setups aggravations and familiarity. Because Peter for a long time refuses to share any personal information Downey is straight-jacketed from revealing much about his character. But the ever-resourceful actor comes up with a hundred ways to express exasperation frustration and peevishness. As for Galifianakis for a spell it appears that he might not go any further than creating a comic shell of defiant even oblivious haplessness; fortunately Phillips and his co-writers dont sentimentalize Ethans innumerable deficiencies as they eke out just enough sympathy for the guys miserable existence to make him understandable and Galifianakis emerges as a worthy Hardy to Downeys Laurel. The wrap-up of his story once he gets to Hollywood is delightful. Opens Friday Nov. 5 (Warner Bros.)

Hot off ""The Hangover"" director Todd Phillips and Zach Galifianakis reteam for more R-rated mayhem in ""Due Date"" delivering a ""Planes Trains and Automobiles""-style cross-country odd-couple comedy thats less raunchy than their last collaboration but every bit as outrageous. With a sequel to 2009s hit bachelor-party romp greenlit even before it opened Phillips clearly saw ""Due Date"" as a necessary change of pace -- albeit one that circles back to his rowdy ""Road Trip"" roots. As such Warners will be lucky to attract a fraction of the ""Hangover"" crowd to watch two grounded travelers driving each other crazy. Only an architect like Peter Highman the tightly wound character Robert Downey Jr. portrays desperately trying to get home in time for his first childs birth could appreciate a comic foil so perfectly constructed to annoy as Galifianakis Ethan Tremblay. In fact so infuriating is Ethan that ""Due Date"" very nearly loses us too at the outset but over time the bearded boor manages to win everyone over audience included. The two opposites collide outside the Atlanta airport where Ethans beat-up station wagon knocks the door off Peters chauffeured town car. Its quite an entrance capped by a slow-motion reveal of Ethans character. Apart from the over-the-shoulder dog-carrying case the rest of his ensemble suggests the sort of person who committed to his look sometime in the mid-80s and hasnt done much to alter it since. Early on Phillips shows things mostly from the more fashion-conscious Peters point of view and its easy to understand why the GQ-ready dad-to-be might not appreciate being seated next to someone so gauche on his long flight back to Los Angeles. Things only get worse when the two are booted off the plane together and added to the no-fly list. Skipping a few glaring logical steps Peter agrees to carpool to California with his bad-luck companion. And so the torture begins. It took Phillips five features to land on the style he established in ""The Hangover"" and ""Due Date"" looks and feels awfully similar subbing a steely blue-gray tint for ""The Hangovers"" golden baked-Vegas glow (courtesy of returning d.p. Lawrence Sher). Phillips a hands-on helmer who went uncredited for his rewrite contributions on the 2009 summer smash shares screenplay billing here with ""King of the Hill"" vets Alan R. Cohen and Alan Freedland as well as Adam Sztykiel and though his instinct for original over-the-top setpieces comes through -- best evidenced by a haywire detour across the Mexican border -- the plot feels drearily linear and predictably episodic by comparison. Since Peters expectant wife (Michelle Monaghan) is planning to give birth by C-section she has control over when the babys going to come which means theres only limited urgency to Peter and Ethans road trip. So the film becomes an exercise in playing the two mismatched personalities against each other Ethan prods Peter with constant questions makes a dodgy detour to acquire ""medical marijuana"" and insists on pleasuring himself to sleep (an activity amusingly mirrored by his dog) while his anger-prone companion does his best to avoid murdering the overgrown man-child. Surely an early draft of the script must have considered this a trial by fire for fatherhood even though the final cut conspicuously lacks the ""is this guy really ready to be a dad"" introspection that invariably accompanies such scenarios. Its worth noting that Phillips has once again mixed dramatic and comedic performers While picking Monaghan over a funnier actress marks a missed opportunity Downey brings just the right combination of wry humor and brink-of-losing-it unpredictability. Eventually Peter comes to realize that while Ethan may be uncouth -- and downright dangerous -- hes not without sympathetic qualities. For example Ethan is mourning the recent death of his own dad and looking for the right spot to spread his fathers remains along the way. So there it is birth and death the whole darn circle of life evoked in service of a few hearty knee-slappers and a doozy of a spit-take with the ashes-filled coffee tin supplying the most poignant and outrageous moments in the film. As the pair make their way West the only surprises not sampled in the trailer are the drug-related ones which means auds know to expect cameos from Danny McBride and Jamie Foxx but dont know which actress will turn up as Ethans pot dealer -- another strategy learned on his last film that familiar faces in small roles can go a long way. However different this pic itll have to do until Phillips delivers his ""Hangover"" sequel.
