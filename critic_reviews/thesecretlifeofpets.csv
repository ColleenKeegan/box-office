"The Secret Life of Pets - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The Secret Life of Pets Posted by Christy Lemire on July 19 2016 1 Comment Universal Pictures Rated PG for action and some rude humor. Running time 91 minutes. Three stars out of four. I realize Im egregiously late in writing about ""The Secret Life of Pets"" -- or any recent movie for that matter -- but Im playing catch-up after being out of town with my family for a couple of weeks. So apologies. But I wanted to get a few thoughts down quickly especially because I had the pleasure of seeing ""The Secret Life of Pets"" while I was away. Its always fun to see movies in other places. Im so accustomed to the ArcLight The Grove and the AMC Century City not to mention all the various screening rooms and revival houses around town. Were truly spoiled having so many options here in Los Angeles. While on vacation for two weeks in Boston New Hampshire and Montreal Nicolas and I caught the first possible showing near us 7pm on a Thursday at the Cinemagic theater in Hooksett N.H. where an entire auditorium sold out requiring the opening of another one. (We also caught the ""Ghostbusters"" remake in Montreal where at first we accidentally went to the theater where it was playing in French as ""SOS Fantomes."" But thats another story for another time.) Nic has been seriously pumped for ""The Secret Life of Pets"" for months now. We are a Minion-friendly household in case you werent aware and the marketing for ""Pets"" which comes from the same production company (Illumination Entertainment) made it look as if it had a similarly adorable anarchic humor. Its actually the summer movie Id been looking forward to most myself between the impossibly cute characters the strong voice cast (Louis C.K. Jenny Slate Kevin Hart Lake Bell Albert Brooks) and the clever premise. Yes its essentially ""Toy Story"" only with dogs and cats. But still -- who doesnt like that idea? And who hasnt wondered what their pets do all day while theyre away? (We dont wonder however. We have a 14-year-old Boston terrier whos deaf and has one tooth left in his head. We know what he does all day He sleeps on the couch.) It is an incredibly simple yet irresistible idea for a movie. Its also exactly what you think its going to be -- no more no less. But the film from co-directors Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney is so perky and agreeable and eager to please -- not unlike our own pets -- that its hard not to be charmed. No it does not have the thematic depth narrative complexity or emotional power of a Pixar movie. Most other animated offerings dont. But its beautiful to look at in terms of color lighting and texture it zips along nicely and its a totally delightful way to spend the afternoon with your family. There is indeed a plot albeit a thin one which relies heavily on amusing sight gags. (Cinco Paul amp; Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch wrote the script.) Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) is an enthusiastic terrier mix whos fiercely loyal to his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). The two of them have a cozy life together in their tiny Manhattan apartment and when Katie leaves for work in the morning Max is content to sit by the door and wait for her to return. He also has friends who keep him company through neighboring windows including Gidget (Slate) a posh puffy Pomerian whos secretly in love with him; Mel (Bobby Moynihan) a nutty pug whos constantly on the alert for squirrels; and Chloe (Bell) a surly portly cat who has a love-hate relationship with the food in the refrigerator. One evening the kindhearted Katie comes back with another dog the garrulous and galumphing Duke (Eric Stonestreet) who proceeds to make himself right at home to Maxs shock and dismay. But then the two of them end up off-leash together no thanks to their distracted dog walker and must rely on each other to get back home. Along the way they cross paths with an underground group of homeless former pets -- a truly random menagerie led by an insanely cute (but also just plain insane) bunny rabbit named Snowball (Hart) whos hell-bent on revolution. Manic animal antics ensue through the streets alleyways sewers and rivers of New York City. And thats about all there is to it. Snowball wants Max and Duke to join his crusade but they kind of like being domesticated. The biggest question isnt whether theyll ever get home again but how -- something they figure out when their friends come to rescue them with the reluctant help of a hawk voiced with rich gravelly menace by Brooks. He is of course a standout among the cast but my favorite of all is Slate. And this is something Ive actually thought and talked about quite a bit since seeing ""The Secret Life of Pets"" because Nicolas likes to hash through plot points after weve seen a movie together and he keeps asking me who my favorite character is. Its Gidget. (He likes Max best in case youre wondering and Louis C.K.s trademark smarts and self-deprecation are just right for the role.) Slates husky earnestness gives the film real warmth and I love the fact that her character looks sweet and small but shes actually quite brave and ballsy. And youve gotta love a heros journey in which the real hero ends up being a woman.

Good to hear you enjoyed it with your family while on vacation. Making unforgettable family memories what life is all about. When I saw the trailer a few months ago I thought Id hate it because I hate adorable animal YouTube videos. People post them to get those of us whove resisted the lure of adopting a pet to adopt a pet. But Ive held myself immune. Even when my grandson begged for a tiny itsy bitsy little kitten I stood my ground. No pets in this house. Not ever again. Too much work. Too much heartache when they pass away onto another plane . . . cause I dont think they go to heaven . . . but their souls have to go somewhere right? You cant be human and look into their sweet ""love me please"" eyes and think theres no soul inside. Anyway . . . Much to my surprise I thought Secret Life of Pets was completely adorable. I didnt pay to see it. I was early for my feature film Seoul Searching Wandered into Secret Life to pass the time. Sat in the first seat in front of the aisle. Kept hearing kids laughing and tittering. Looked behind me. The place was packed. Laughing and cheering continued to the end. A nice ride with a bowled over audience. My favorite character Snowball (Kevin Hart). As a cuddly little bunny Kevin Harts over-the-top exuberance worked. Good to see you back.

When Odysseus returned to Ithaca and disguised himself as a beggar Argos recognized his owner even when his best friend Eumaeus couldnt. White Fang saved a judge from a murderous criminal. Eddie the Jack Russell was indisputably the least irritating character on Frasier.The Secret Life of Pets is by no means great art but what saves it from being a hugely predictable Toy Story ripoff/monomyth-by-numbers is simply the fact that it has dogs. A wiry complacent dog named Max. A big schlubby emotionally inconsistent dog named Duke who looks a bit like a Snuffleupagus. A snow-white cotton ball of a dog named Gidget who has attachment issues. It has cats too and a moronic guinea pig and a homicidal bunny and a carnivorous hawk and a pig with tattoos but the primary reason for the movies appeal is its ability to comprehend the bizarre fidelity of dogs to their humans. Pets isnt exactly faith-in-humanity restoring in the manner of Wall-E or Inside Out but at the end of a week in which mankind has illustrated some of its most dismal traits theres something quietly therapeutic about spending 90 minutes with some nutty heroic furballs on a heros journey with very low stakes. Related Story With Inside Out Pixar Returns to Form Promos for the movie have sold it as imagining an alternate reality wherein animals get up to zany hijinks while their owners are at work. Approximately everything funny about this scenario has already been included in the trailer--the poodle who switches the music from Mozart to death metal when his owner goes out the dachshund who uses the KitchenAid to scratch his belly. So the onus is mostly on Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) to carry the movie by doing an excellent impression of a good dog and having an adventure. Hes helped by Gidget (voiced with asthmatic brilliance by Jenny Slate) whos in love with Max for no reason other than that she sees him through the window sometimes and he seems like a good dog.Pets is the latest animated feature from the director Chris Renaud and Illumination Entertainment the animation production company that made Despicable Me Despicable Me 2 and their despicable spinoff Minions. But it seems to owe a greater debt to Pixars Up which produced the best portrayal of an anthropomorphized dog to date in Dug a dopey Golden Retriever who runs up to humans and declares ""I have just met you and I love you."" Max waits faithfully by the door when his human (Ellie Kemper) leaves and fixates on a small green ball. His blissful existence in captivity is complicated only when Duke lures him away from the dog walker and the two get picked up by Animal Control after which theyre broken out by a psychotic rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart) who wants to initiate them into his gang of Flushed Pets (all the animals mythology and Gawker would have you imagine live in New York City sewers).The visuals throughout The Secret Life of Pets are gorgeously imaginative One of the weirder scenes is an elaborate fantasia in which Max and Duke break into a sausage factory and hallucinate dancing wieners that sing ""We Go Together"" at a fairground while blissfully submitting to being devoured. There are intriguing tensions in the subtext that the movie does its absolute best not to explore. (Is it better to be a free pet or a pet in fealty to humans? Does human love make up for being trapped in a 600 square-foot apartment for 22 hours a day?) Mostly though its about loyal idiotic optimistic dogs and their redemptive love for humankind. This by itself--even without the lengthy celebrity lineup and the sophisticated visuals and the recurring gags about cats being the worst thing ever--justifies its existence. As Charles de Gaulle once summarized ""The better I get to know men the more I find myself loving dogs.""

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

"Secret Life of Pets The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; secret-life-of-pets-the ) Secret Life of Pets The (United States 2016) July 08 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli About 20 minutes into The Secret Life of Pets an entertaining but inconsequential animated movie I was struck by a powerful feeling of deja vu. It didnt take long for me to ascertain the cause. The Secret of Pets is pretty much Toy Story with animals standing in for toys. Theres a Woody-type (the old reliable much loved veteran whose territory has been invaded) a Buzz Lightyear-type (the brash newcomer) and (when we get into the wider world of New Yorks alleys) a gang of animals who have been abandoned by their owners (this was a key plot element of Toy Story 3). Theres bonding between the old timer and the newcomer an attempted rescue by the old timers friends and various other elements that keep The Secret Life of Pets in familiar territory. It makes sense. Toy Story is a proven commodity - a well-loved brand that has been hugely successful at the box office. There are worse sources to borrow from. The animation in The Secret Life of Pets has a generic quality. The film is heavily influenced by the Despicable Me style (not a surprise considering the cross-pollination between the Gru/Minions films and this one) which is okay except it doesnt appear to have advanced in the last six years. I almost always come away from a Pixar film impressed by what the animators have accomplished. The Secret Life of Pets doesnt score high on the ""shock and awe"" scale. The visuals arent bad but theres nothing special here. The people look like caricatures and the creatures have a cartoonish stuffed animal appearance. The backgrounds are the most arresting aspect of the presentation. The movies opening scenes show (as one might expect from the title) how pets spend their days after their owners head off for work. Most of these vignettes can be found in the trailers so like Minions the best parts of the movie are available (legally) on YouTube. Were introduced to likeable hound Max (voice of Louis C.K.) his neighbor Gidget (Jenny Slate) and the finicky fat cat Chloe (Lake Bell) who rejects her dried food in favor of refrigerator leftovers. The plot kicks into gear when Maxs owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) brings home a new ""pal"" for Max the bossy oversized Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The inevitable turf war spills out onto the streets and during the next days walk Max and Duke slip away from their sitter and are captured by animal control workers. One rescue later they find themselves out of the fire and into the frying pan with the gang of anti-domestication bunny rabbit Snowball (Kevin Hart) not taking kindly to a small deception they perpetrate. The rest of The Secret Life of Pets consists of Max and Duke trying to get home before Snowball and his posse finish them off while Gidget Chloe and a few friends try to find Max. The Secret Life of Pets offers its share of solidly amusing comedy; these moments are more effective than the rather hum-drum ""action"" scenes that are designed more to amuse children and provide fodder for video game adaptations than to engage adults. The movie does a good job anthropomorphizing the dogs cats birds etc. Familiar characteristics are incorporated into the animals actions. For example echoing the behavior of any domestic cat Chloe cant resist chasing (and pouncing on) moving moving streaks of light. The movie is preceded by a new seven-minute long Minions short that sees an intrepid quartet of the yellow fellows getting into the landscaping business. The breezy cartoon is suitably amusing and may be of more interest to some young viewers than the main feature (as was the case a few years ago when Disney offered a Frozen short prior to the live action Cinderella). Its a savvy marketing ploy - some children uninterested in The Secret Life of Pets may be attracted by the Minions even if theyre not on screen for long. This review may sound unnecessarily negative for a film that provides families with an opportunity for mid-summer bonding (even if it arrives in theaters a little too close to Finding Dory). Although lacking the strong emotional punch of a Toy Story The Secret Life of Pets is strong enough that parents wont fall into a catatonic state while watching it with their offspring. Unlike top-notch animated fare however its questionable whether this can be considered ""destination fare"" for the single adult.

"Pets The animals in our lives.

Of course we want to know what those adorable creatures with whom we share our lives are up to and so ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is here to explore those possibilities. Turns out their days are much more dramatic and crazier than ours with all sorts of underworld pet societies and warring animal factions. Theres apparently a lot to keep secret in the lives of these pets. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" comes from animation studio Illumination Entertainment -- the home of those ubiquitous Minions who remain inescapable as theres a short film featuring the industrious yellow creatures before the feature. ""Pets"" is helmed by directors Chris Renaud (""Despicable Me"") and Yarrow Cheney. If youve ever really wanted to know what your pets think when a new one joins the flock according to ""The Secret Life of Pets"" its not anything good. The hero here is Manhattan mutt Max (Louis C.K.) blissfully in love with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). Its a perfect partnership until she brings home shaggy stray Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and three becomes a crowd. Locked in a rivalry for top dog in Katies apartment Max and Duke become separated from their pack during a walk and end up on a crazy adventure that takes them through the sewers across the river to Brooklyn and back again. One of the more intriguing herds they encounter is the revolutionary group of ""flushed pets"" those abandoned or otherwise disposed of creatures who have banded together against humankind. They are led by the adorable fluffy bunny despot Snowball voiced hilariously by Kevin Hart spouting street gangster rebellion rhetoric while flashing cute huge rabbit eyes that will give you whiplash from the cognitive dissonance. If the execs at Universal and Illumination Entertainment are smart Snowball will get his own spinoff. Another supporting character deserving of more time? The lovestruck ball of fluff that is the Pomeranian Gidget voiced by Jenny Slate. When her crush Max goes missing Gidget is on the case enlisting the help of the other pets in the building Mel the pug (Bobby Moynihan) Buddy the dachshund (Hannibal Buress) Chloe the cat (Lake Bell) and Tiberius the falcon (Albert Brooks). The feisty Gidget will not rest until Max gets home safe and taps into her tougher side surprising herself and her pals. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is definitely cute definitely funny and draws on the universal experience of pet ownership to draw out the ""awww"" in all of us. But the film butt-scoots by on its premise. Theres not much more going on thematically or emotionally below the surface. We know the pets love their owners and vice versa and there are some sweet moments that illustrate how a pet can be life buddy -- just you and Spot against the world. Theres some pathos wrung from Max and Dukes sibling rivalry that turns into an alliance under pressure but there arent any particularly touching or original messages to dish out. Its a fun summer flick for kids that parents will enjoy too a worthy choice for any summer afternoon -- if youve already seen ""Finding Dory.""

In the pet food chain its a snack for the cat whos in turn a chew toy for the dog who is itself a banquet for the crazy neighbors trained hawk -- wholl also swoop up the guinea pig for dessert. And thats just nature. In the bright wicked world of Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renauds The Secret Life of Pets the fiendish animators have crayoned unnatural enemies for dear lost mutts Max (Louis C.K.) and his oafish adopted brother Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a lizard a tattooed pig several turtles ferrets a giant viper and a psychopathic bunny (Kevin Hart) who war-whoops ""Death comes to Brooklyn"" as the pair of estranged housemates try to make it safely back to their Manhattan apartment. Then there are the humans. Every animal flick comes with evil dogcatchers -- cartoonists draw them as instinctively as basset hounds howl at the moon. But even we owners get a guilt trip. Poor Max whimpers every time his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) walks by him without a head pat. She thrusts Duke into his life without noticing that the bigger dog a Chewbacca on his knees steals Maxs dog bowl and his bed. When Katie leaves for work Max suffers like a poet with tuberculosis. At least the buddies in his building -- harumphing cat Chloe (Lake Bell) pug Mel (Bobby Moynihan) dachshund Buddy (Hannibal Buress) and guinea pig Norman (Renaud) -- stop by for a visit. Still as the owner of a Maine Coon Ive weed-whacked into a goofy lion cut I gulped when Snowball the bunny a former magicians assistant bellows ""All of us have suffered at the hands of man"" UniversalThe Secret Life of Pets is the sour-candy version of last months Finding Dory. Both track in epic animal adventures under the literal feet of human overlords and both even grab the wheel for a truck-smashing climax thatll screw up traffic for hours. (What no sympathy for the stars of Cars?) And both seem to hint at a turn toward the darker 80s kids movies that deliciously tortured a generation. Take a fantasy sequence in which the dogs break into a sausage factory. Hot dogs dance the hula and its cute ... until Max chomps one in half and the wieners severed legs keep grooving. Thats balls -- literally depending on your hot dog recipe. Where Dory was saccharine Pets is anarchic. Its the difference between Mickey Mouse and Looney Tunes or The Muppets where crazy creatures take aim at each other with cannons. That sense of play infects the animation which favors fun over photo-realism. Ill endure losing the crystalline wonder of seeing every bot-drawn blade of fur for the joy of seeing Chloe a blimp on ballerina feet tuck herself into a too-small box. Thats one of this dog-slobbery flicks rare concessions to cat lovers. Otherwise felines lead merciless street gangs or in a true insult get confused for good-looking dogs. ""Im a cat"" sneers Chloe at the near-sighted canine (Albert Brooks) who loves her curves. ""Nobodys perfect"" he shrugs stealing a line from Some Like It Hot. Guess his owner rents a lot of classic movies. I laughed myself silly at The Secret Life of Pets. I had no choice. Theres a metalhead standard poodle my two passions coming together at last. Its enough to make you forgive the opening Minions gardening short an ode to leaf blowers and dog poop. Almost. (Where in the food chain are Minions? Can we please bump them lower?) I respect Petss morbid touches a couple of gruesome deaths a chilling underwater scene straight out of Casino Royale and the pig scarred with ink from the butcher shop including the word ""bacon"" carved into his neck. No wonder Max fits in by fibbing that he killed Katie with a blender. Yet ultimately the film makes peace between beast and man. The humans come home. The food bowls get filled. The soundtrack gives everyone a musical hug. And we head home to our own pets assuring ourselves that they love living with us too. Um right guys?

The latest animated film from Illumination Entertainment the company behind ""Minions"" is long on chaos but short on cleverness -- a loud colorful excuse to put kids in an air-conditioned theater but a bit of an endurance test for adults. Thats a shame since things start promisingly. Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) explains in voiceover what a swell set-up hes got going with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) right before she hits him with the big furry surprise Duke (""Modern Familys"" Eric Stonestreet) a rescue dog will be joining their happy home. In one of the best lines Max seeks to describe Duke to Katie as ""the death of all good things"" which to her naturally just sounds like a series of frantic barks. Related Finding Dory feels less buoyant than Nemo Yet the expected parallels to childhood -- feeling replaced by a new sibling -- quickly devolve into a fractured series of subplots dead ends and malnourished storytelling. Specifically Max and Duke wind up on the street together -- lost without their collars and desperate to get back to a New York skyline that has seldom looked more shimmering. Moreover they encounter a homicidal bunny (Kevin Hart energetic at first abrasive before its over) leading a gang of discarded critters on a crusade to destroy people beginning with these domesticated mutts who dare embrace them. Meanwhile the neighborhood pets launch a rescue mission led by the fluffy Gidget (Jenny Slate) who not so secretly loves Max. Her ragtag pack includes Chloe (Lake Bell) an obese cat who is a walking visual gag; and Tiberius (Albert Brooks currently doing double voice duty in ""Finding Dory"") a hungry hawk Gidget enlists never mind his temptation to prey on pretty much everybody. Related Voltron and Adventures in Babysitting revived TV look to the past for kids shows The shared dangers they face become an obvious bonding exercise for Max and Duke. Yet as escapes and characters pile up -- seemingly as much to pad the length as advance the story -- the abundant action yields diminishing returns. Flashes of wit become too sporadic as the writers fall back on poop (or pellets) and pee jokes mostly squandering the inherent charm of a dogs-eye-view. None of that should seriously dampen the bottom line for this release from Comcast (CMCSA) unit Universal and there are worthwhile moments scattered along the way. But in response to the question ""Whos a good movie?"" what should have been an enthusiastic tummy rub doesnt merit more than a grudging pat on the head.

The result great casting design and character conception; a plot that makes precious little use of any of that; decent humor; and an overreliance on wacky action at the expense of anything worth caring about. Affable terrier Max (Louis CK) gets the Woody role convinced of his owners undying devotion and therefore mystified when an interloper shows up in the form of a big brown pound pooch named Buzz er Duke. Their rivalry gets them lost in New York City which is a shame because the pets back home is far more interesting than the angry gang of Flushed Pets our heroes wind up running with (and from). And while a Busby Berkeley number set in a sausage factory is good fun too much of the film feels like hot dog filler inoffensive but also insubstantial.

The Secret Life of Pets has some guesses (UNIVERSAL) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 08 2016 at 800 AM updated July 08 2016 at 1000 AM comments There isnt a pet owner who hasnt said ""I wonder what Derby/Dulce/Roger do all day when Im not home?"" Well ""The Secret Life of Pets"" has the answer. And its not pretty although it is occasional fun. Some dogs it seems wait patiently wagging their tails. Some cats eat everything in sight. Some parakeets do their exercises. But then one day all of them do a good deal more when two of them are lost by a distracted dogwalker and get grabbed up by animal control. And its up to all the pets of Greenwich Village to save them. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" comes from some of the same folks behind the ""Despicable Me"" movies and once again theyre smart enough to pick their voice talent from comedians rather than movie stars. Yes big-name actors give you a name to put on the poster too. But a stand-up comic or an improv vet knows how to twist a line or escalate a moment. Theyre always ready to embrace the laugh. And so the normally dour Louis C.K. is our little-dog hero Max; Eric Stonestreet is his big ""The Defiant Ones"" companion Duke. Particularly charming is Jenny Slate as Maxs secret admirer Gidget a furball who turns out to have more bite than bark. The city landscapes are terrific and a doggie-fantasy sequence inside a sausage factory is bizarrely wonderful; the character design though is only middling. The tiny Max is very endearing but Duke just looks like an animated version of Rowlf from the Muppets; a few of the other animals are a little too aggressively cute/comical. MORE A few words with Kevin Hart The story - credited to three screenwriters - is also overcomplicated. Itd be enough (as it was in ""Shaun the Sheep"") to merely have Max and Duke rescued from the pound; instead the plot adds in a revolutionary group of anti-human ex-pets who start chasing our heroes as well. This certainly adds an unexpectedly darker edge. And a great character in the rebel gangs bloodthirsty leader who is A a bunny B named Snowball and C voiced by Kevin Hart. Now thats funny. But its also extraneous distracting us from what we really came to see our pets secret lives. The big chase scenes and action-movie adventures are fine. But what delights here are the small details of what happens once we close the door - the standard poodle who throws a heavy-metal party or the dachshund who gets massages. And whats genuinely moving are the little scenes when the pets and people interact - animals snuggling on beds or rolling over for belly rubs stern humans turned suddenly goofy as they make faces at their goldfish or embrace their squirming gerbils. Theyre not exactly the scenes-from-a-marriage sequence from ""Up"" - but they are awfully sweet. Still with a nice soundtrack and a few-well-deserved hipster/Brooklyn jokes ""The Secret Life of Pets"" emerges as a nice alternative to seeing the very good ""Finding Dory"" again (and a much better option than sitting through the tiresome ""The BFG""). You could do worse than taking someone small in your life to the theater this weekend. Unless they have feathers or fur. In that case youre probably better off waiting a few months and doing a rental. Ratings note The film contains some bathroom humor. The Secret Life of Pets (PG) Universal (90 min.)

FILM REVIEW The Secret Life of Pets An animated comedy sure to please kids parents Add to ... Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 08 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 08 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Chris Renaud Yarrow Cheney Written by Ken Duario Brian Lynch Cinco Paul Starring Voices of Louis C.K. Jenny Slate Kevin Hart Classification PG Genre animation Year 2016 Country USA Language English I knew a dog who could be heard scrambling off the forbidden couch at the sound of a key in the door - so as to be discovered lying innocently on the hallway floor when his master entered the house. What do our urban pets left alone for hours as we go off to work and school get up to all day long? From that slim comic premise the people behind the satisfyingly zany Despicable Me have now crafted The Secret Life of Pets an amusing animated adventure full of talking animals that should please both children and their parents.Max (Louis C.K.) is a much-loved Manhattan pooch who spends his day waiting for his beloved mistress Katie to come home - while occasionally chatting with his adoring neighbour the fluffy little Gidget (Jenny Slate) sitting on a balcony across the way. One day Katie brings home Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a big slobbery hairy guy who threatens to muscle the incumbent out of the way until Max outsmarts him by trashing the place figuring he can blame it on this new stray.When the battling pair give their dog walker the slip Duke gets his own back and leads Max on a mad chase that winds up in the sewers of New York where they are confronted by the stuff of urban legend. The Flushed Pets are a furious gang of snakes iguanas and crocodiles whose owners have ditched them. Led by a demonic little bunny (Kevin Hart) they threaten Max and Duke with certain death until the plucky Gidget rides to the rescue.The observation of animal behaviour is apt and the animation is consistently imaginative one of the funniest vignettes features a dachshund who uses the beaters on an electric mixer to give himself a back massage. There are also gloriously vertiginous views of New York including a lovely set piece in an alleyway full of feral cats and fluttering laundry.Many of the animals are rapidly and cleverly summarized there is the haughty poodle who turns the classical station to metal the minute his owner is out the door and the captive hawk desperately trying to overcome his temptation to eat the smaller animals while Harts off-kilter casting as Snowball the villainous bunny works well.As for the main pair however one may be small and short-haired while the other is big and hairy but both are voiced rather similarly by C.K. and Stonestreet as charming operators smart funny guys. Neither is sufficiently characterized by either the script or the actor to make him a strong protagonist in a movie that is crowded with characters and incidents. The human aspect of the central relationship if I may call it that is only cursorily observed.Indeed if children will be entertained by the unwilling roommates narrow escape from cats dog catchers and the Flushed Pets it is the mass of surrounding detail from the glittering Manhattan skyline and Gidgets sleek modernist pad to the animals remarkable mastery of domestic technology that will impress the adults.

Probably something better than this generic animal adventureCat Chloe (voiced by Lake Bell) left terrier mix Max (Louis C.K.) and excitable Mel (Bobby Moynihan) star in ""The Secret Life of Pets.""(Photo Universal Studios)""The Secret Life of Pets"" has a title that sells itself. Who hasnt wondered what our pets are up to behind closed doors while were away?The title it turns out is the best thing about ""The Secret Life of Pets."" Once the story kicks in ""Pets"" becomes a generic talking animals adventure with predictable gags stock situations and not enough heart to elevate it above the competition.A voice cast that includes Louis C.K. Eric Stonestreet Bobby Moynihan and Dana Carvey doesnt add any life to the characters or the material. Only Kevin Hart voicing a bunny hellbent on world domination makes an impression but an animated bunny is far from the best fit for Harts manic talents.The movie starts with Max a Jack Russell Terrier voiced by Louis C.K. who gets jealous when his owner brings home Duke (Stonestreet) a big ol Newfoundland who barges in and makes himself at home. One day when out for a walk the two lose their way and wind up being dragged into an underworld of street animals (including Snowball the leader bunny voiced by Hart). Its up to Dukes pals from his apartment building to save them and bring them back to safety all before their owners arrive home.""Despicable Me"" 1 and 2 director Chris Renaud (who co-directed with Yarrow Cheney) keeps the action coming at a brisk pace and the film is as loud and busy as expected from modern cartoons. But theres nothing deeper at play no clever animal insights and nothing that makes good on that great title. You come hoping for a ""Toy Story"" about cats and dogs you end up with ""Ice Age"" with domesticated animals.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284Twitter grahamoramaThe Secret Life of PetsGRADE CRated PG for action and some rude humorRunning time 91 minutes 19 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/29AJzIZ MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/07/08/review-secret-life-pets-squanders-great-premise/86839394/,200,thesecretlifeofpets9,thesecretlifeofpets,detroitnews

Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures Max (Louis C.K.) in The Secret Life of Pets. Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures The mediocre animated comedy The Secret Lives of Pets is based on an original idea by Chris Meledandri the head of Illumination Entertainment the studio responsible for the Despicable Me movies and their popular spinoff Minions. That idea? Toy Story but with house pets which really tests the elasticity of the word ""original."" For animal lovers however the hook (""Ever wonder what your pets do when youre not home?"") is mainlined catnip given the degree to which we already anthropomorphize our beloved kitties and pups (and hamsters and fish and falcons). The fantasy may relieve a little guilt too Its nice to imagine them socializing and having adventures rather than sitting around bored waiting for their owners to return from work. The Toy Story cribbing doesnt stop there. The film includes furry analogs to Woody and Buzz in the rivalry-turned-friendship between a beloved old dog and an attention-grabbing new one and the action moves from a contained living space to the chase-filled openness of the wider world. Viewed generously The Secret Lives of Pets has recognized a winning formula and followed it appealingly with brightness pace and a fusillade of slapstick and verbal gags. Yet the Toy Story comparisons are obvious enough to measure all the ways the new film falls short the dimmed sophistication of the jokes and cultural references the thinly distinguished characters the gloppy sentimentality. ""Its not Pixar but itll do"" may get families in the theater but its not an inspiring proposition. Louis C.K. does make an adorable terrier though and his caustic tone establishes the Manhattan setting more efficiently than the opening which lays the Taylor Swift song ""Welcome to New York"" over shots of the skyline. He voices Max the happy resident of an apartment building that flutters with social butterflies whenever humans are not around. (The humans leave a lot of windows ajar.) When his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) adopts a large fluffy adorable companion named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) Max resents the divided attention and does his best to sabotage his new roommate. Their relationship changes when Duke tricks Max into slipping away from their dog walker and its up to Maxs friends -- led by Gidget (Jenny Slate) a spirited Pomeranian and Chloe (Lake Bell) a gluttonous cat -- to track them down. The complications pile up. Max and Duke come across ""The Flushed Pets"" a cult of sewer-dwelling nasties led by a vindictive bunny (Kevin Hart) that chase them all the way to Brooklyn. The search party expands to include a hawk named Tiberius (Albert Brooks) and Pops (Dana Carvey) an old dog with wheels for back legs who has the connections to help navigate the sewers and back alleys of the city. Their journey would seem extremely unlikely had small fish not pulled off the aquatic equivalent a few weeks ago in Finding Dory. At a certain point The Secret Life of Pets drops the ""secret"" part that was so essential to its appeal. The pets stop acting like pets when human eyes are on them and suddenly a couple of dozen of them are piled into a taxicab blazing across the Brooklyn Bridge. It may be nitpicky to question the internal logic of a film where one dog has ninja skills and another can grasp and turn a set of keys underwater but the further it ventures into the improbable the worse it gets. Perhaps because it reneges on its initial promise These are not how pets act when their owners are not around. This is how they act when theyre in a Madagascar sequel. The best scenes are the precious few domestic ones that bookend the film when the pets are introduced via a clever series of comic vignettes and the apartment building turns into a bustling social hot spot. They may chat it up but the pets are still recognizable as animals in all their particular enthusiasms and desires and defined sweetly in relationship to the owners who love them. The Secret Life of Pets drifts away from the fantasy that sparked it until the pets dont seem like pets anymore.

"The Secret Life of Pets doesnt actually contain any secrets worth spilling - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Secret Life of Pets doesnt actually contain any secrets worth spilling ""The Secret Life of Pets"" Illumination Entertainment / Universal Pictures Chloe (voiced by Lake Bell) and Max (Louis C.K.) in the animated comedy ""The Secret Life of Pets."" Chloe (voiced by Lake Bell) and Max (Louis C.K.) in the animated comedy ""The Secret Life of Pets."" (Illumination Entertainment / Universal Pictures) Justin Chang Why does ""The Secret Life of Pets"" exist? I mean besides the obvious reasons like the bankability of family-friendly animation the ticket surcharges for 3-D or the fact that Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment are trying to boost their share of the non-Minion collectible toy market. No the questions and possibilities raised by this new feature-length cartoon -- antically directed by Chris Renaud and his co-director Yarrow Cheney -- are too deep and perplexing to be discussed in such crass commercial terms.Does the movie perhaps mean to enlighten the stereotypically inclined animal lovers in the audience -- to show us that dogs can be more than dumb slobbering oafs and that not all cats are contemptuous self-absorbed snobs? That unbeknownst to us our favorite domestic animals are actually fascinating fully developed characters in their own right? Now that weve observed the secret lives of bees the American teenager and Walter Mitty does this latest tell-all actually contain any secrets worth spilling? If only. Opening with a Taylor Swift-scored tribute to New York and ending with a traffic-stopping action climax that has the grave misfortune of following ""Finding Dory"" into theaters ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is governed by a spirit not of revelation but of confirmation. Arriving in the dog days of an unusually mediocre summer for big-studio entertainments the picture is a glorified hairball pulled together from the strands of better more appealing movies and then noisily coughed up and disgorged at a multiplex near you.The three screenwriters (whose combined credits include the ""Despicable Me"" movies as well as the Dr. Seuss adaptations ""The Lorax"" and ""Horton Hears a Who"") have concocted a familiar lost-and-found fable starring Max a floppy-eared skinny-legged terrier with a big brown nose and the average-guy voice of Louis C.K. For Max life is pure bliss He adores his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) and has free rein over her New York City apartment -- that is until Katie brings home an enormous shaggy brown rescue named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) forcing Max to share his creature comforts. The Secret Life of Pets trailer Watch the trailer for ""The Secret Life of Pets."" Watch the trailer for ""The Secret Life of Pets."" See more videos Max seeks distraction and emotional support from the other pets in the neighborhood including Chloe (Lake Bell) a fat cat who cant keep her claws out of the fridge; Norman (Renaud) a directionally challenged guinea pig; Buddy (Hannibal Buress) a dachshund whose whose body provides one of the movies better visual gags; and Sweetpea a parakeet with a fondness for flight-simulator video games. But his best friend though he doesnt yet know it is Gidget (Jenny Slate) a fluffy fiercely loyal white Pomeranian who adores Max from her white-walled modernist pad across the street.The most amusing sequence (already spoiled in the trailer) shows these and other animals having fun and acting naughty once their owners backs are turned initially suggesting that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" might turn out to be the ""Toy Story"" of talking-animal movies. It is nothing of the kind unless ""Toy Story"" suddenly turns into a bad movie when our backs are turned. Resisting the temptation to invest its characters and storytelling with any particularly winsome distinctive qualities the film quickly devolves into an infernally busy and overextended chase sequence crammed with desperately unfunny comic patter and noisy pointless action.A series of events conspires to unleash Max and Duke on the streets and sewers of New York and send them running frantically in every direction. Along the way they must bury the hatchet avoid the dog pound and escape an anti-human terrorist cell consisting of various stray animals with a vengeful hatred for domestic pets. The storys lack of imagination is matched only by its excess of noxious attitude; after all youve never been entertained until youve heard a homicidal bunny rabbit yell ""Long live the revolution suckers"" in the manic squeal of Kevin Hart.If that doesnt do the trick perhaps youd like to hear classic songs like ""Stayin Alive"" and ""Lovely Day"" shoveled like kitty litter into the cracks of Alexandre Desplats brassy musical score. Surely the surprise martial-arts showdown or the completely random homage to ""The Abyss"" will tickle your fancy. Or here check out this dream sequence in which Max and Duke visit a sausage factory hurling themselves into a sort of magical wiener wonderland that may remind you how much funnier it was when Homer Simpson visited the Land of Chocolate. Visually as well as dramatically Renaud and his collaborators employ the same undiscriminating everything-but-the-kitchen-sink aesthetic that has become a hallmark of the Illumination brand. (In case youd forgotten what that brand is the feature is being shown in theaters with an atrocious four-minute short called ""Mower Minions."") Compared with the higher budgets and superior standards at the animation houses of Disney Pixar and DreamWorks (which was recently acquired by Universal) the movie boasts a polished but unflattering visual style that is admirable at least in theory for abandoning photorealism in favor of a more angular stylized direction.The pets with their comically exaggerated features and body types are unlikely to out-cute the pictures on your favorite BuzzFeed list. But critter characters neednt be aww-inspiring to be engaging. And some here -- like Gidget whom Slate brings to raspy sparky comic life and Tiberius (Albert Brooks) a predatory eagle trying to stay on his best behavior -- succeed in diverting you for a moment even if they pale next to the expressive character design and intelligent cross-species subtext that distinguished this years other far superior animal-kingdom cartoon.Which brings us back in a roundabout fashion to my earlier question. Perhaps the real reason ""The Secret Life of Pets"" exists is to remind you how good ""Zootopia"" was -- which since many of us still remember is no reason at all.------------The Secret Life of PetsMPAA rating PG for action and some rude humorRunning time 1 hour 31 minutesPlaying In general release See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times HBOs new programming boss talks True Detectives fate pulling the plug on Vinyl and a hope for more diversity Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-secret-life-of-pets-review-20160704-snap-story.html,200,thesecretlifeofpets11,thesecretlifeofpets,latimes

Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures The Secret Life of Pets    1/2 (out of five) Directors Chris Renaud Yarrow Cheney Cast Louis C.K. Eric Stonestreet Ellie Kemper Kevin Hart Rated PG (action and rude humor) Running time 90 min. By Maricar Estrelladfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Jul. 07 2016 Thursday Jul. 07 2016 Monday Jul. 04 2016 By Maricar Estrella Fort Worth Star-Telegram So what do your pets do when youre not at home?Thats the premise behind the animated film The Secret Life of Pets which is cute charming and a little hyper -- just like a new puppy.When the two-legged New Yorkers leave their high-rise apartment building their pets rule the roost. The fat cat raids the fridge the poodle switches his mp4 from classical to heavy metal music pets visit and gossip about their owners and lounge around watching reality TV -- Animal Planet of course. Loyal terrier Max ( Louis C.K.) doesnt want to bother with the four-legged crew. He would much rather spend his entire day waiting for his beloved owner Katie ( Ellie Kemper) to come home. By all accounts Max is leading a charmed life until Katie brings home a rescue dog Duke ( Eric Stonestreet) who threatens to upend Maxs only-child lifestyle. In the midst of the sibling rivalry the pair get lost and must evade not only animal control but a human-hating gang of former pets led by the cunning bunny Snowball ( Kevin Hart). The dynamic canine duo have to set aside their differences and unite against the bad bunny.With all of the comedic stars the film has a fair share of LOL moments. And while you wont find any revelatory insight into the mind of your pet parents and children alike will fall for this fun fast-paced furry tale. Sometimes the storyline strays too far from home and the multitude of commercially cute characters may make your head spin. But its to be expected from the folks who brought us Despicable Me.In fact it may have been a disservice to Pets to remind audiences of the well-done Despicable Me franchise by showing a new animated short film Mower Minionsbefore the feature film. In a few minutes the animated short accomplished what Pets did in 90. Maricar Estrella 817-390-7720 maricare Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Characters voiced by Louis C.K. Eric Stonestreet Kevin Hart and more. Directed by Chris Renaud (Despicable Me) and Yarrow Cheney. In theaters July 8 2016. (Credit Illumination) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two domestic dogs lost in Manhattan must find their way back home.CAST Louis C.K. Eric Stonestreet Kevin Hart Jenny SlateRATED PG (rude humor and some peril)LENGTH 131BOTTOM LINE An affectionate ode to the bond between humans and their animals. The idea that your pet knows more than he lets on is a staple of childrens movies from 1965s ""That Darn Cat"" to 2001s ""Cats and Dogs."" Its probably because pets are like children themselves little beings whose smarts and self-reliance are chronically underestimated by grown-ups. In these movies much of the fun comes from watching the underdogs so to speak put one over on the clueless adults. Add to that list ""The Secret Life of Pets"" a fun frisky movie about domesticated animals on the loose in New York City. Produced by animation studio Illumination Entertainment with an aspirational eye toward the emotionally resonant narratives of Disney-Pixar ""Pets"" boasts a top-notch voice cast several appealing characters and a heartwarming story about teamwork and friendship (and ownership). Its the rare example of kid stuff that will please parents as well. advertisement | advertise on newsday Our hero is Max a mixed-breed terrier whose friendly voice comes from the usually dyspeptic comedian Louis C.K. Max lives in apartment-bound bliss with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper briefly) until she throws him for a loop by adopting Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a shaggy brown mutt of uncertain but very large pedigree. The dogs struggle for alpha status ends with them accidentally off leash and very far from home. Critics picksThe best animated films ever madePhotos10 best movies of 2016 so farSUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summer Dog catchers give chase but the real villains here are other animals the Flushed Pets an underground army of such discarded critters as snakes rats and sea monkeys (""Its not our fault we dont look like the ad""). Their leader is Snowball a deceptively adorable bunny with the outraged voice of Kevin Hart. As Max and Duke run afoul of these vengeful animals Maxs friends -- led by the lovelorn Pomeranian Gidget (Jenny Slate) -- scour the streets on a rescue mission. After producing several big loud hits -- notably ""Despicable Me"" and ""Minions"" -- Illumination Entertainment finally pays close attention to nuance movement and expression in its animation. All the animals have vivid personalities even peripheral ones like Leonard a stately poodle who keeps switching his masters classical playlist to punk-metal. Overall ""The Secret Life of Pets"" puts us in a whimsical world where our furry friends get the better of us humans and we dont mind a bit. 4 more secret filmsEveryone has a secret even cats and dogs according to the new movie ""The Secret Life of Pets."" Here are four other films that shared secrets with audiences. THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (1947) -- Danny Kaye played seven roles as James Thurbers milquetoast creation who daydreams about being everything from a riverboat gambler to a fastidious French fashion designer.THE SECRET LIFE OF AN AMERICAN WIFE (1968) -- An agents bored wife (Anne Jackson) hopes to spice up her life by posing as the call girl her husband has hired for some afternoon delight with his movie star client (Walter Matthau).THE SECRET LIVES OF DENTISTS (2002) -- A dentist (Campbell Scott) suspects that his wife (Hope Davis) with whom he shares his practice is having an affair but he doesnt know what the drill is for dealing with the situation in Alan Rudolphs indie drama.THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES (2008) -- A lonely South Carolina teen (Dakota Fanning) who hasnt recovered from her mothers death and cant deal with her abusive father finds solace in a different town by keeping bees.-- Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Kevin Hart and Eric Stonestreet. Photo Universal Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com July 7 2016 310 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS Measured by sheer kinetic energy ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a commercial contender though far from a film that audiences can take to their hearts. When it comes to emotional content or simple coherence however this animated feature from Illumination Entertainment plays like the spawn of storytellers running on empty. The title is inviting--Pixar hasnt done so badly with the secret life of toys--and the first few minutes are amusing. Max a terrier mix voiced stridently by Louis C.K. brings friends into his apartment to hang out when his beloved owner Katie ( Ellie Kemper) is at work. Life is good until Katie brings home another pooch a big brown slobberer named Duke. Sibling rivalry ensues followed by chaos in a sorry excuse for a plot that I wont try to describe except to say that Max and Duke become part of a vast menagerie of fevered creatures who chase through New York City in a cartoon version of ""Its A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" a coarse cartoon of a live-action comedy that at least had stars the audience cared about. More Reviews Captain Fantastic Zero Days Will ""The Secret Life of Pets"" find a wide audience? Maybe so. Kids who watch junky stuff race by on TV screens can sit in a theater and watch much bigger junky stuff race by in an unquenchable stream of sight gags. Unquenchable that is for a span of 90 minutes at the end of which exhaustion and accompanying depression may set in. Id rather not dwell on what the people at Illumination must think of kids attention spans. Theyre marketing a movie in which things happen from one second to the next with no particular logic to no discernible effect. Theres no secret life because theres no life only the promise of pets in perpetual motion. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download Despicable Me (2010) The intriguing title of this hit debut feature from Illumination Entertainment refers to the villainous hero Gru ( Steve Carell by way of Bela Lugosi) who does bad things for no good reason. Gru is a funny guy and he becomes an interesting guy when he crosses paths with a trio of orphan girls who appoint him their father and melt his heart.

"The Secret Life of Pets tickles our funny bones review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Secret Life of Pets tickles our funny bones reviewAnimated animal adventure The Secret Life of Pets delights with its screwball menagerie even if the plot is something less than a bow-wowzer.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 7 2016The Secret Life of PetsAnimated comic adventure featuring the voices of Louis C.K. Kevin Hart Eric Stonestreet Lake Bell and Jenny Slate. Directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney. Opens Friday at major theatres. 90 minutes. GBe careful what you woof for.Thats the predicament of Max (Louis C.K.) canine protagonist of The Secret Life of Pets whose desire for companionship leads to a menagerie of mayhem across and beneath New York City.Article Continued BelowBut its no problem at all for humans. We can enjoy the frisky hilarity of an animated animal adventure that delights with its screwball characters even if the plot is something less than a bow-wowzer. Louise C.K. voices Max in The Secret Life of Pets.Its the latest creation of the Despicable Me franchise smarties co-directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney and scripted by members of the same team. They continue the Looney Tunes-meets-Charles Addams look and narrative approach also employed for the spinoff series Minions (who are featured in an amusing companion short).Max is the rescued and now pampered terrier pet of Katie (Ellie Kemper) a Manhattan apartment dweller. When Katie goes off to work Max feels lonely a problem she attempts to solve by adopting another stray a shaggy Newfoundland dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet).The two dont get along to put it mildly and their squabbles result in them running wild in the big city where they risk being captured and impounded (or worse) by Animal Control authorities. Other beasts are a more immediate concern. Sewer-dwellers called ""The Flushed Pets"" led by angry white bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart) want Max and Duke to join their human-hating horde to plot societal downfall or find dinner whichever comes first. Will Max and Duke ever get home?Thats the bare-bones story stretched to fill a scant 90 minutes and barely justifying the title but well-groomed characters carry the day. Snowball is a bizarre cross between Peter Rabbit and Monty Pythons Killer Rabbit. He also gets most of the films best lines -- ""Youve got the stench of domestication all over you"" he growls at Max and Duke -- and Hart has ironic fun playing a gangsta cottontail. Other standouts in this zany zoo Jenny Slates Gidget a Pomeranian with a crush on Max (and also a rescue plan); Albert Brooks as the hawk Tiberius who has to learn to hunt but not prey; Chris Renauds Norman a guinea pig with a talent for getting in and out of trouble; and Michael Beatties Tattoo a bozo barnyard pig whose multiple tattoos make him look like a refugee from a Pink Floyd tour.Despicable detail enchants the eye and ear of this candy-colored NYC the Animal Control van reads ""Gotcha"" on the licence plate; the Beastie Boys ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" welcomes visitors to the borough; a poster for Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds hangs behind the cage of tiny parakeet Sweet Pea (Tara Strong).Jokes about dogs being loyal and cats untrustworthy abound of course but there are a few back flips - whod have guessed that French poodles prefer head-banging metal to classical music?

Two things you wont be surprised to learn from this zippy Manhattan-set animated lark from the ""Despicable Me"" studio Illumination Entertainment this worlds animals can talk (albeit only to each other) and dizzying adventure follows. But for all the genuine charm on display you may be disappointed to find that manic activity overtakes said charm and that more isnt made of a simple clever premise that nevertheless seems destined to rake in big summer movie bucks. See Video The Secret Life of Pets Trailer Reveals What Animals Do When Their Owners Are Away Theres plenty to like in the first twenty minutes though. Its hard not to fall for a winning early montage that clues us in to what happens when off-to-work owners -- in this movie apartment-dwellers all -- shut the door on their pets. A dachshund manipulates the electric mixer into a massage device. A bird turns a whirring fan and a POV video game into a virtual reality flying exercise. A poodle flips the radio from classical music to heavy metal. Of course thats just the makings of a cute animated short. A feature requires a story so our narrating protagonist is an adorably needy terrier mix named Max (Louis CK) whose daytime existence is as most dog lovers suspect waiting expectantly for owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) to come back home. But when she returns later with a pound rescue -- a big shaggy ball of dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) -- Max feels threatened and a mini turf war develops. Also Read The Secret Life of Pets Set to Unleash 80 Million Debut Curbing Finding Dory The leash comes off though when Max and Duke get separated from their dog walker and get lost in big bad Manhattan. A run-in with an externally fluffy internally hardened street rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart) leads to an underground lair of ""flushed"" pets discarded animals from the cute (dogs cats) to the creepy (alligators snakes) that Snowball is organizing to retaliate against an uncaring human world. Between the sweetly funny apartment scenes and the clever revolutionary humor of the rejected pets director Chris Renaud (""The Lorax"" ""Despicable Me 1amp;2"") early on strikes a sprightly balance between the cutesy and anarchic in the screenplay (credited to Cinco Paul amp; Ken Daurio and Bryan Lynch). But as our dog heroes adventure shifts into warp speed -- chase rescue repeat -- you can feel the graceful zaniness give way to forgettable high jinks and a mechanical attention-holding pace. A late-in-the-game stab at sentiment concerning Dukes origins feels more like a breather in the action than an organically heartfelt story point. Still this is one of the rare animated films outside of Pixars roster in which the key vocal performances have a comic exuberance that syncs up nicely with the character renderings. Louis CKs unmistakable blend of sardonic smarts and average-dude appeal are perfect for a worried mutt like Max although his personality is ultimately drowned out by the whiz-bang plot. Harts Snowball meanwhile dominates the movies frenetic second half offering up a pleasurably warped energetic mixtape of tough-guy stylings in one of the busy comedians best performances. See Video Justin Timberlake Makes Mini Music in New Trolls Trailer Theyre both aided by enjoyable turns from Jenny Slate as fluffy Pomeranian Gidget who leads the mission to save her dog-crush Max; Albert Brooks as a wily wizened hawk named Tiberius; and Dana Carvey as Pops a street-smart flirtatious coot of a basset hound on wheels. (My early hunch that Billy Wilders urban farces were an inspiration for the movie was justified when at one point Pops quotes a famous line from ""Some Like It Hot."") Amiable and inoffensive ""The Secret Life of Pets"" wont rock anybodys world among connoisseurs of talking animal sagas not when the menagerie-with-a-message hit ""Zootopia"" and the runaway smash sequel ""Finding Dory"" have proven their box office mettle. This one is basically a peppy gag reel and more likely than most family fare to get parents and children to laugh at the same gleefully absurd set-ups from pets throwing a raucous party to a tattooed pig driving a van to a loopy Max/Duke dream sequence in a magical all-sausage land.

Eric Stonestreet Ellie Kemper Kevin Hart Lake Bell; Director Chris Renaud Yarrow Cheney; Release Date Wide 07/08/2016; Runtime (in minutes) 91; MPAA Rating PG Posted July 7 2016 -- 245 PM EDT Whether you own a Siamese or a shih tzu at some point youve sat at your desk at work and wondered whats going on at home while youre away. Its a mystery thats led to the invention of the pet cam countless paintings of dogs playing poker and now a new film from the animation house behind the Minions. Like Toy Story The Secret Life of Pets anthropomorphizes the things we love endowing them with colorful voices and oddball personalities. As soon as our backs are turned the whole obedience shtick goes right out the window. Louis C.K. lends his slightly neurotic tonsils to our hero Max--a floppy-eared mutt who happily belongs to Katie (Ellie Kemper). That is until she brings home a big dumb furball named Duke who looks like Chewbacca and sounds like Modern Familys Eric Stonestreet. Cue the jealous rivalry and the series of dirty tricks to determine who will be the resident alpha dog. From a New York apartment building straight out of Rear Window our duo and a menagerie of their four-legged pals break free hit the mean streets and run afoul of a gang of mangy strays led by Kevin Harts hyped-up scene-stealing bunny Snowball. Pets has a great premise but its more busy than clever. Sylvester and Tweety packed more anarchy and wit into a six-minute Looney Tunes short than Renaud and Cheney manage in an hour and a half. Like a dog that endlessly chases its tail in circles Pets is amusing for a while then it just tires itself out.

Comments click to enlarge The Secret Life of Pets 3D New Video Rated PG  91 minutes  2016 Secretly our pets are just like us except that they riff like seasoned club comedians (Louis C.K. Kevin Hart) and sail around the frame like fat ballerinas. Despicable Me animators Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud branch out with this spirited tale about two mismatched dog pals and the neighboring pets from their Manhattan apartment complex running loose in the streets. Comedy animation is all about timing and Coffin and Renaud have it in spades though the story--a variation on the old Disney live-action feature The Incredible Journey--is so tired that the action cant let up for an instant. Quirkier than Disney less crass than Fox and content to let Pixar do the showing off the animators have created their own commercial niche.

This is a two-star movie with moments of sheer exuberance and clever good fun -- but just as many scenes that had me tilting my head like a dog trying to figure out what the WHAT is taking place before his very eyes. Example. About halfway through the movie our hero dogs Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet) stumble upon a sausage factory in Brooklyn. (Hey. These pets have secret lives.) What follows is a trippy detour involving dancing and singing tubes of meat -- and a visual and musical homage to a very popular musical from nearly 40 years ago. Not only will zero percent of the children in the audience get that reference Id say maybe a quarter of the adults will understand it -- and most of them will be asking ""Why?"" Also this isnt exactly the sweet and cute and utterly kid-friendly movie you might expect it to be. Sure there are wonderful vignettes sure to ring true with pet owners everywhere -- but ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is also downright menacing at times. SPOILER ALERTS Alley cats hiss and bare their claws and attack innocent pups. A giant viper and a voracious alligator are among the scary creatures prowling the sewers of New York. One of the dogs rounded up by Animal Control is outfitted with a mask that brings to mind Hannibal Lecter. Oh. And one human character is killed off with a casual shrug of the plot. One moment your little one will likely be giggling with delight. The next you might find yourself explaining why a vicious villain is squealing with glee when hes told a couple of pets have killed their owner. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is essentially the first ""Toy Story"" reimagined with cats and dogs (and other assorted pets). Our narrator is a shorthaired terrier named Max (voiced by Louis C.K. who sheds every inch of his cynical sad-sack persona and does a great job of conveying well a dog). In the opening montage Max tells us all about his blissful life with his human the lovely and sweet Katie (Ellie Kemper). As Max tells it he and Katie have the greatest time -- but every morning she just LEAVES him. Where does she go? Why does she do that? Oh well. At least Max has his friends to keep him occupied until Katie returns. Theres a Pomeranian named Gidget (Jenny Slate) who lives across the way and is madly in love with Max; the blimp-shaped fat cat Chloe (Lake Bell); a not-very-bright but likable pug named Mel (Bobby Moynihan); and other assorted pets all of whom can converse in English once their humans are out of the picture. Max has quite the perfect life -- until the night when Katie comes home with a huge rescue mutt named Duke (Stonestreet) and tells him Duke is his new ""brother."" Rivalry on. The battle between Duke and Max leads to both of them stranded on the streets of New York stripped of their identifying tags and pursued by Animal Control and a rogue group of ""Flushed Pets"" who have been abandoned by their owners and are staging a revolution to free all animals from their humans. (No. Really.) The leader of the movement is a mean and slightly crazy little bunny named Snowball who worked with a magician for 10 years until ""rabbit out of the hat"" routines lost their appeal. Snowball is voiced by Kevin Hart and hes funnier here than in any live-action movie role hes had in recent memory. Also adding spark Albert Brooks as Tiberius the hawk who must suppress his appetite so he can learn to get along with other creatures and Dana Carvey as Pops an elderly basset hound who gets around in one of those dog wheelchair contraptions and is ""connected."" Carvey sounds like hes channeling Lionel Barrymores Mister Potter from ""Its a Wonderful Life"" and he scores perhaps the films biggest laugh with a joke about his advanced age. Speaking of scores Alexandre Desplats bouncy 1960s-sounding music is annoying overkill. When theres a chase sequence or some other type of romp we dont need ""romp music"" telling us its a romp. Were already romping. One of the things the movie gets right is the matchup of humans with their animals of choice. From the Cat Lady to the elderly owner of a very old dog to the guy who has a hawk the people and their animals (or the animals and their people) are well matched. The movements of the animal characters are also spot on. A pup circling around before settling into his blanket; dogs distracted by butterflies and bouncing balls; a cat using a mouse as a plaything. Great stuff. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" also has fun with the behavior of the humans including a dog walker who pays very little attention to his job. But theres too much dark even mean-spirited cynicism. And the ending isnt nearly as heartwarming as it could have been because the writers and co-directors opted not to go with a certain (and seemingly pretty obvious) dramatic choice. Even though Im not recommending ""The Secret Life of Pets"" I wouldnt mind seeing a sequel. The main characters deserve another at-bat.  Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Chris Renaud co-directed by Yarrow Cheney and written by Cinco Paul Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch. Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG (for action and some rude humor). Opens Friday at local theaters.

He is a member of the National Society of Film Critics author of the books Hollywood Cafe Coffee With the Stars and Hollywood Rides a Bike Cycling With the Stars and producer at ridesabike.com. More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 In the interest of full disclosure it should be noted that theres a Jack Russell living in my house. One that looks quite a bit like Max the white-and-patchy-brown terrier voiced with a canny canine neediness by Louis C.K. in the animated (extremely animated) The Secret Life of Pets. The fact that Max is one of the movies panting principals - and that he can be seen in the opening montage sitting upright nose high in the basket of his owners bike as she pedals through Central Park - well my critical faculties have pretty much just gone out the window. Which Ill wager will be the case for audience members who have a beloved pooch or kitty at home - or a perky parakeet hapless guinea pig or a twitchy bunny for that matter. Directed by the Despicable Me franchises Chris Renaud The Secret Life of Pets is a pet-lovers loving salute to the domesticated animals we rely on to bring us comfort companionship and triple-digit veterinary bills. Set in a bright bustling Big Apple The Secret Life of Pets is about what happens when the humans go off to work leaving their four-legged friends back in the apartment to fend for themselves. Its also about what happens one fateful evening when the perky human Katie (the voice of Ellie Kemper) returns home to Max with a shaggy brown beast rescued from the pound. Accustomed to getting all the attention (not to mention all the food) Max does not welcome the messy behemoth named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Territorial disputes ensue. So does a crazy plotline involving an underground gang of revolutionaries called the Flushed Pets led by a white rabbit with a bitter view of humankind (yes Kevin Hart as a bunny named Snowball - talk about color-blind casting). Theres a scary clowder of alley cats. Theres a trained hawk who sounds an awful lot like Albert Brooks (it is). A pampered Pomeranian (Jenny Slate) a rotund tabby (Lake Bell) and a dachshund with a novel use for the electric mixer add to the madcap menagerie. And yes there is a tattooed pig. In one epic chase Max bounds through city intersections leaping through the open windows of crisscrossing cabs (go Jack Russell go) intent on saving Duke from the clutches of Animal Control. And theres a dramatic rescue too in the churning depths below the Brooklyn Bridge. Theres also an elaborate song-and-dance number in a sausage factory. A real um Busby Bark-Ley production. In much the same way that the smash Zootopia demonstrated that creatures of different culture and class and species are better off when they come together The Secret Life of Pets is a testament to teamwork and friendship and fixing the rifts that divide us. Let the fur - and the warm fuzzy feelings - fly. sreaphillynews.com 215-854-5629 Steven_Rea MOVIE REVIEW The Secret Life of Pets  (Out of four stars) Directed by Chris Renaud with Yarrow Cheney.

Credit Universal Pictures First things first ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is preceded by a short film starring the Minions in which those irrepressible yellow gelcaps take up landscaping so they can purchase a blender. You may regard this extra little cartoon as a bonus or a tax depending on your level of Minion tolerance. Mine reached its end around 90 seconds before the movie did. But in any case Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures are determined to keep selling toys and Halloween costumes and its pointless to protest the merchandising of manufactured cuteness. Video Movie Review The Secret Life of Pets The Times critic A.O. Scott reviews ""The Secret Life of Pets."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date July 7 2016. Photo by Universal Pictures. Part of the Minions ostensibly universal charm lies in the fact that they speak no known language but rather a chirpy vaguely Spanish-inflected patois. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" Illuminations newest feature relies on the more conventional sound of celebrity voices mostly belonging to people who are professionally funny on television. Children may not be all that familiar with many of them including Louis C. K. who plays the main character a dog named Max. Louis C. K. on his television projects and in his stand-up tends to work on the blue end of the spectrum trafficking in melancholy as well as profanity. His presence here may be a gift to his own children and to their college funds. It might also provide a measure of consolation to gloomy sensitive middle-aged dads who need to sense a kindred soul on the other side of the screen.Similarly Hannibal Buress (a dachshund) Jenny Slate (a fuzzy white lap dog whose exact breed I could not identify) and Lake Bell (a cat) might be here not because kids will recognize them from ""Broad City"" or ""Obvious Child"" or ""In a World"" but because youngish parents might want to feel a little bit cool at the multiplex on a Saturday afternoon. No shame in that Fans of ""Modern Family"" will be happy to hear Eric Stonestreet as a big furry dog. Fans of Kevin Hart who want more after ""Central Intelligence"" and ""Ride Along 2"" will enjoy his impersonation of an angry bunny. Albert Brooks is a grumpy raptor. That sentence was a pleasure to write. Video Trailer The Secret Life Of Pets A preview of the film. By UNIVERSAL PICTURES on Publish Date April 18 2016. Photo by Universal Pictures. Watch in Times Video >> embed There is also a guinea pig some other birds lizards and even a few human beings. But this is mostly a dog story full of capers and complications arising from the arrival of Duke (the big shaggy one voiced by Mr. Stonestreet) into the household Max shares with Katie (Ellie Kemper) his millennial owner. There is rivalry and resentment and eventually friendship. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" written by Cinco Paul Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch and directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud is like one of those picture books about how to deal with a new baby but with talking animals.Which is all in all pretty good fun. Talking-animal cartoons generally are if they have even a modest quantity of wit or cross-species insight. And while this movie never achieves -- and does not really aim for -- the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features or the sly social consciousness of ""Zootopia"" it has a playful absurdity and a winning friendly spirit. Interactive Feature Summer Movies Preview 10 Trailers for July Giants ghosts and Jason Bourne will be on the big screen this month. OPEN Interactive Feature As the title suggests the conceit is that when we humans are away our furry scaly feathered companions get up to all kinds of mischief. They visit one anothers apartments they dance and flirt and play loud music and then when we return pretend that theyve been waiting for us the whole time. Except for the cats of course who make a great show of not caring. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Here I should say that while Ms. Bells purring vocalizations are beyond reproach the film is clearly the work of dog people and traffics -- like nearly every other movie in its genre -- in some tired anti-feline stereotypes. I could go on about this but Im not supposed to let my political opinions affect my reviews. And Im not biased. Dogs are fine. I have shared my home and opened my heart to a few of them. But theyre also just too easy with their wet noses and broad pink tongues and eagerness to please. Cats are demanding. Complex. A more daring movie would have ventured beyond fat pampered house cats and scrawny alley predators in its depiction of them. Representation matters. Photo Tiberius voiced by Albert Brooks left and Gidget voiced by Jenny Slate. Credit Universal Pictures Speaking of politics the house pets encounter an underground militant organization led by Mr. Harts adorably fuzzy implacable little rabbit. He steals the movie of course and helps it ascend to a level of anarchic delight. The animated action is bouncy and frenetic and if the story becomes a little too busy it moves quickly and makes room for a barrage of jokes and even some character development. Ms. Slates Gidget the lap dog evolves from a lovestruck princess (pining for Max) into a fierce and resourceful action heroine. Max himself grows less self-involved. Everyone gets home safely.Like the ""Despicable Me"" movies which put Illumination on the map (and spawned those furshlugginer Minions) ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is adequate animated entertainment amusing while it lasts but not especially memorable except as a catalog of compromises and missed opportunities. Among those are the New York setting a potential wonderland of glamour filth and imagination that is rendered as blandly as if the movie had been shot on a back-lot set.""The Secret Life of Pets"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Fewer poop jokes than you might expect. Running time 1 hour 26 minutes.

Rated PG (mildly scary sequences). The question is a source of endless entertainment and frustration for anyone with pets What are they thinking? This simple premise spun into a caper by the canny team behind ""Despicable Me"" and its hyperactive sequel ""Minions"" makes for a pretty amusing ride. The fact that comedian Louis C.K. voices our narrator a Jack Russell terrier doesnt hurt. His wry delivery makes Max a likable slightly curmudgeonly every-dog and a perfect foil for a goofy cast of characters including a Pomeranian with a crush on him (Jenny Slate) a laconic cat (Lake Bell) an enthusiastic brainless pug (Bobby Moynihan) and a bunny (Kevin Hart) with a murderous vendetta against humans. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is at its best when it sticks close to home. As the owners in Maxs apartment building leave in the morning each pet has a different reaction to the finality of that shutting door. The cat up-ends her food dish with a calm swipe of course; the ditzy guinea pig lost in the buildings air ducts pops his head out for a greeting. My favorite the standard poodle with the snooty owner switches classical background music to headbanging metal. An outing with the dog walker allows for more riffing ""Throw it with your arm you lazy weirdo"" a dog yells at someone with one of those plastic ball-throwing sticks. Another deals with the indignity of being on a retractable leash. But when Maxs owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) brings home a second dog -- a giant drooling beast named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) who hogs the bed and the food -- Max goes ballistic scheming to get Duke permanently ousted from the homestead. The film loses a little steam as the two get lost in New York and fall in with a gang of abandoned pets led by the deceptively adorable Snowball (Hart). Once the dogs are on a quest to get home ""The Secret Life of Pets"" becomes just another cartoon -- Theyre driving a van from the dog pound Theyre joining forces to fight off a giant snake -- rather than a clever spin on familiar pet behavior. Albert Brooks shows up as a red-tailed hawk whose desire to help clashes with his killer instincts; Dana Carvey is pitch-perfect as the ancient basset hound whose back legs are in a wheelchair. Occasionally directors Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney let the adventure get surreal; as Max and Duke romp through a sausage factory in Brooklyn their feeding frenzy concludes with a ""Grease""-homage hallucination that looks choreographed by Pee-wee Herman. They also make sure to get in a love letter to the bond between humans and animals A montage of owners coming home at the end of the day may get even non-pet people choked up.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Did you know that our cherished nonhuman playmates turn all talkative when we leave for class or the office? And they become adventurous and sometimes go astray and get lost in the city? Most of us have known that since ""Toy Story"" but it seems theres a new audience for old animated ideas every year or two. This time ""The Secret Life of Pets"" turns the classic story line to focus on dogs cats birds and various exotic animals living in New York City apartments rooftops and sewers. The main characters are Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) a domesticated terrier completely devoted to his female owner and Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a huge oaf of a rescue mongrel that she introduces as his new ""brother."" Their relationship doesnt jell as quickly as she expected and soon the pair are outdoors leashless on the citys mean streets and small fish in a very big pond. They are intimidated both by the citys gruff Animal Control dogcatchers and the human-despising white rabbit Snowball (Kevin Hart who draws giggles with every bleat). Hes the leader of ""The Flushed Pets"" who want them to join his posse of strays and help kill his homo sapiens enemies. On the dogs side but generally out of view are Gidget (Jenny Slate) a white Pomeranian with a total crush on Max and a hawk named Tiberius (the ever-priceless Albert Brooks) whom she recruits to help rescue them. The film is the latest offering from Illumination-Universal the upstart studio that has quickly earned 2.5 billion with its ""Despicable Me"" and ""Minions"" franchise. Elements of its winning formula are here; directors Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney know how to handle a solid cast generate blissful silliness out of slapstick and deliver striking visuals with a remarkable rich depth of field. Its not a bad cartoon. Theres not much here that you wish you could fast-forward through. Some of it is quite original and zany especially an absurdist dream sequence that takes Max and Duke to Wiener Kingdom a sausage wonderland with a freaky ""Grease"" soundtrack. The movie is simply a ""get in trouble run and hide repeat repeat repeat"" tale lacking the secret sauce that makes animated movies like ""Finding Dory"" ""Inside Out"" ""The Lego Movie"" and ""Zootopia"" wonderful. The Secret Life of Pets 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG action and some rude humor. Good comedies even those aimed at young audiences have a slant a twist a concept. Theyre saying something inventive about the things they satirize. Here were presented with a grab bag of random jokes that are mostly amusing but not pointed. The film delivers retread ideas from ""Jurassic Park 2"" and the Beastie Boys along with the ""predator and prey"" theme in ""Zootopia"" and a car chase a few notches below the one in ""Finding Dory."" It even reaches for a bit of Pixar heart-tugging with a peculiar subplot where a dog discovers its previous owner has died. The scripts highlights of originality are repeated jokes about the animals bodily fluids (and solids) that hang around past the expiration date. Its not disappointing. Its perfectly serviceable without being special. I wasnt underwhelmed. I wasnt overwhelmed either. I was just whelmed.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Correction An earlier version of this review misspelled the last name of Hannibal Buress. This version has been updated. By Michael OSullivan July 7 A terrier named Max (Louis C.K.) starts to feel neglected as a favorite pet when his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) gets a new dog. The sloppy mongrel named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) becomes his rival. (Universal) ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is like how I imagine dog food tastes blandly palatable but apparently containing some mysterious ingredient with an appeal that lies beyond my species. Although others at a recent screening were certainly gobbling up the animated animal-centric comedys kibble of one-liners and sight gags the films humor remained largely imperceptible to me. I repeat largely. Kevin Hart provides the voice of the films villain a manic maniacal white bunny named Snowball and he is as you might expect hilarious. Every minute the character is onscreen is a demented joy and every minute he is not is well not. Snowball figures in the story thus When the rivalry between a dutiful terrier named Max (Louis C.K.) and his slobbering new mutt of a housemate Duke (Eric Stonestreet) spills out of their cozy apartment and into the street the two dogs go missing falling afoul of Snowball -- a former magicians rabbit relegated to the trash -- and his subterranean gang of unwanted undomesticated animals. Called the Flushed Pets Snowballs crew includes an alligator (presumably dumped down the toilet once it got too big) and a pig once used for inking practice in a tattoo parlor. With their irrational anger directed not at society but at animals that have found human companionship -- ""leash lovers"" in Snowballs spit-flecked parlance -- the outcasts chase after Max and Duke who are simultaneously being sought by a menagerie of their friends led by a Pomeranian named Gidget (Jenny Slate) who has a crush on Max. Deranged rabbit Snowball (voiced by Kevin Hart) and his underground gang have put a target on the lost ""leash lover"" Max (Louis C.K.) in ""The Secret Life of Pets."" (Illumination Entertainment/Universal Pictures) And that as they say is that. Including a subplot involving animal control officers the movie is essentially one long chase sequence which itself is merely a pretext for a string of hit-or-miss jokes. When one of a bowl of Sea-Monkeys -- weird-looking brine shrimp a novelty pet sold from the back of comic books during the Cold War -- cracks that ""Its not our fault we dont look like the ad"" you could have heard crickets chirping. Theres plenty of humor in the film that only a 5-year-old would appreciate. (Poop jokes anyone?) But Im not sure that viewers younger than 50 will get the Sea-Monkeys reference. A few bits are more successful including a surreal set piece in which Max and Duke who have wandered into a hot dog factory imagine an elaborate musical number featuring dancing weiners ""We Go Together"" from ""Grease"" as if choreographed by Busby Berkeley. Its nutty and has nothing to do with anything other than the way dogs minds work. (L to R) Duke (Eric Stonestreet) owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) and terrier mix Max (Louis C.K.). (Illumination Entertainment/Universal Pictures) Buddy a dachshund voiced by Hannibal Buress. (Illumination Entertainment/Universal Pictures) Speaking of which theres precious little of that other than a recurring gag about how easily dogs are distracted. (It was funnier in ""Up."") And the theme of human mistreatment of animals is no more than a whiff here. Why couldnt the film have found a way to be both relevant and funny a la ""Zootopia""? As for the voice talent with the exception of C.K. whose put-upon comedic persona is a good fit for Max and Hart whose Snowball seems to be running on a liter of sugary soda and adrenaline the characters sound pretty nondescript. Stonestreet is virtually unidentifiable and several other actors -- Lake Bell as a cat Bobby Moynihan as a pug Hannibal Buress as a dachshund -- are wasted. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" comes from Illumination Entertainment which brought you ""Despicable Me"" and ""Minions."" Its signature exaggerated animation style -- spindly legs oversized torsos -- is on display and occasionally inspired. But the humor is generic. And the films most obvious comparison -- its been called ""Toy Story"" with animals -- only points up the one thing ""Pets"" lacks and that any animal lover will tell you their furred and feathered friends have in spades personality. PG. At area theaters. Contains slapstick action and rude humor. 91 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Hes used to being the center of attention until Katie takes in a stray named Duke whom he instantly despises. The film is funniest and best when it lives up to its title. When it turns into a chase-adventure film its not as successful.Mel is featured in ""The Secret Life of Pets.""(Photo Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 out of 5 stars""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a pleasant-enough movie that would have been much better had it lived up to its title.For a time it does. The animated film directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney imagines what animals do when their human owners are away. (Echoes of ""Toy Story"" dont help on the comparison front.) The story begins with Max (Louis C.K.) the self-described luckiest dog in New York City loved and doted upon by his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). Some of the films best moments occur watching Maxs behavior around her like when he bolts upright with excitement when she walks past collapses in disappointment when she doesnt stop to pet him snaps to attention when she walks past again etc.Its cute funny and knowing a combination screenwriters Ken Daurio Brian Lynch and Cinco Paul dont always achieve (they often settle for one or two of those elements).In ""The Secret Life of Pets"" find out what happens when you leave your furry friends alone in the house. (Photo Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures)We also meet some of Maxs friends like Gidget (Jenny Slate) the Pomeranian who secretly loves him; and Chloe (Lake Bell) the fat cat who tells Max flat out she doesnt really care about his problems with catlike attitude.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceThen one day Katie comes home with Duke (Eric Stonestreet) an oversize mutt who threatens literally and figuratively to take over Maxs place in Katies life or at least her apartment. Max and Dukes competitive dislike for each other leads to them getting lost and going underground at which point the story goes into the sewer.That is not a metaphor. Well at least not entirely. They wind up in the lair of the Flushed Pets a group of discarded animals who have sworn vengeance on the human race that has turned its back on them. Or something. Theyre led by the unhinged rabbit Snowball (Kevin Hart). When the rebels learn that Max and Duke are not really down with the cause as it were and accidentally cause a death () the two must run for their lives.Gidget watches Max at the door in ""The Secret Life of Pets."" (Photo Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures)Meanwhile Gidget realizes Max is missing and enlists the help of a predatory hawk (Albert Brooks such a treasure) and Pops (Dana Carvey) an ancient dog who has connections all over the city to help find him. Thus two groups are after Max and Duke with vastly different agendas.It gets nutty and silly pretty quickly. Maybe its me but I find the mere notion of an alligator living in the sewer among the Flushed Pets funnier than a tattooed pig driving a car (with an iguana working the accelerator and brake pedals).MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestA lot of movies abandon smart ideas. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is one of them. There are still some laughs and the animals are cute. Snowball gives Hart a good vehicle for his all-over-the-place humor and its intriguing to see Louis C.K. play nice. But its a lot more interesting when we see what the pets are getting away with when were not there (and who hasnt wondered) or when Max simply lays out his goals for the day to Gidget Hes got big plans really big -- hes going to sit and stare at the door and wait for Katie to return.""The Secret Life of Pets"" would have been a funnier better movie if hed stayed there.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Updated July 30 2016  702 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movies Secret Life of Pets gets to the bottom of an eternal mystery By Jody Mitori Special to Go Magazine Jul 7 2016 (...) What happens to our pets when we leave each day? Does the dog stare at the front door anticipating our arrival? Does the rabbit long for us to take it out of its cage? Does the cat ... well we know the cat just sleeps all day.Those hours when humans are away from their furry friends are the setup for the delightful animated film ""The Secret Life of Pets.""Canine Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) loves owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). While he waits for her to come home from work he passes the time talking to neighbor pets. Theres fat cat Chloe (Lake Bell) who lounges around; adoring Gidget (Jenny Slate) who cant hide her admiration for Max; and lost guinea pig Norman who runs through apartment building ducts trying to get back home. All is well until Katie brings home a new pet burly Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a bully who quickly claims Maxs bed and food. Max tries to think of ways to get rid of Duke but when Duke finds out he leads the two of them away from the rest of the animals and eventually into the hands of a dog catcher. That sets the story in motion with the two dogs trying to get back to Katie.But thats just one of the films many adventures. Dogs try to find their home friends look for friends and would-be enemies try to settle a score. The result is a series of clever action sequences set in and around New York City so beautifully depicted that Woody Allen would be proud.Director Chris Renaud (with co-director Yarrow Cheney) brings the same quick humor and sense of mischief that he showed in ""Despicable Me"" and ""Despicable Me 2."" Like those films ""Pets"" nods to the past with its bright colors Alexandre Desplats jazzy score and a truly bizarre Busby Berkeley dance sequence at a sausage factory. The voice actors are well cast including Louis C.K. Slate and especially Kevin Hart in a showy role as Snowball an adorable-looking bunny who is the tough-talking leader of a group of rejected animals called the Flushed Pets.Some of the best scenes show the filmmakers affection for creatures of all kinds especially their observations of human and pet behavior. One tip for owners You may want to wash that Kitchen Aid mixer before you use it next. The short ""Mower Minions"" (written and directed by Glenn McCoy of Belleville) that precedes ""Pets"" is funnier than the full-length ""Minions"" from last year.

Illumination Entertainment Britton Peele GuideLive BrittonPeele bpeeledallasnews.com The Secret Life of Pets is basically Toy Story with animals and thats mostly OK (B-) Jul. 6 2016 1011am Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Britton Peele Share This Story Share Discuss Meh You know how the Disney/Pixar classic Toy Story asks the question ""What do all of my toys do when Im not in the room?"" The Secret Life of Pets asks that same question only you know with pets.For the most part it works. It allows for a diverse cast of characters including a rabbit a guinea pig a hawk and (most prominently) multiple breeds of cats and dogs each of which adds something to the formula. It also offers familiarity as you can watch the well-animated animals on screen and say ""Thats totally like my own dog""But it also treads some familiar ground. Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) is the favorite toy -- err I mean pet a of Katie (Ellie Kemper) and his life as an ""only child"" is wonderful. At least until Katie brings home a new dog Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and the rivalry for top dog status leads to both animals getting stranded away from home. If they want to get back to Katie theyll have to learn how to get along especially when a villainous rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart) stands in their way. In this image released by Universal Pictures Gidget voiced by Jenny Slate left and Max voiced by Louis C.K. appear in a scene from ""The Secret Lives of Pets."" Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures via AP You could make many comparisons to the journey of Woody and Buzz but you probably get the gist.Of course kids arent likely to mind. For them theres a lot to love. The animation is wonderful leading to plenty of colorful visual gags and over-the-top situations. This is the same animation studio that brought you Minions so theyve had a lot of experience lately in crafting jokes that dont rely on dialogue.But your children might not know how to react to jokes about animals killing humans and disillusioned former pets who want to hear all the gory details when they think some new mob recruits murdered their owner. These bits arent too grisly and dont get too drawn out but they feel out of place in what is presumably a kids movie. Some of the dialogue here (and elsewhere) makes it seem as if Illumination Entertainment knows that it would benefit from some humor thats aimed more at the adults in the audience but it still needs some practice when it comes to balancing those jokes with the needs of younger viewers. Still when its more focused on having fun The Secret Life of Pets has moments where it shines. Jenny Slate is highly enjoyable as the voice of Gidget a Pomeranian whos crazy in love with Max and Albert Brooks has some laughable moments as Tiberius a hawk whos resisting his primal urge to eat all the small animals around him.Clocking in at an hour and a half one of the better aspects of The Secret Life of Pets might be that it doesnt really outstay its welcome. There arent a lot of slow moments so when a scene isnt really doing it for you you can rest assured that it will be over quickly. And hey at least its not another Minions movie.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The basic premise of The Secret Life Of Pets is simple and cute What do our pets do all day when were not home to watch over them? The opening scenes of the film demonstrate just that in a series of charming vignettes visiting all the pets in an apartment building in an idealized Manhattan where the trees actually have leaves and theres no trash on the sidewalk. Taylor Swifts ""Welcome To New York"" and a handful of other geographically appropriate pop hits play on the soundtrack although most of the music comes from veteran composer Alexandre Desplats light jazzy score. Left to their own devices the animals do some things you might expect them to do (bark at squirrels chase balls stare longingly at leftovers in the fridge) and some you might not (throw wild parties with toilet-water chugging contests and a soundtrack by Andrew W.K.).Louis CK--this is New York hes practically obligated to show up--stars as the voice of Max a cheerful easily distractible slightly dopey terrier whos wholly devoted to his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). The role doesnt require much dramatic heavy lifting on CKs part but for those used to his cynical sad-sack persona on Louie its fun to see him playing such a gee-whiz character. The rest of the comedian-heavy voice cast plays more to type Albert Brooks as a self-loathing hawk for example or Jenny Slate as hyperactive Pomeranian Gidget who--despite Slates great voice performance--would be more interesting if she had any motivation besides her crush on Max. Also in the neighborhood are Lake Bell as fat indifferent house cat Chloe Bobby Moynahan as cowardly pug Mel Tara Strong as chickadee Sweet Pea and Hannibal Buress as Jello-boned dachshund Buddy. Maxs life with his animal friends is a happy one--until Katie brings home big clumsy Chewbacca-esque mutt Duke (Eric Stonestreet) from the pound throwing his orderly world into chaos. Before long theyve escaped the dog park and the movie shifts gears from episodic slice-of-life to high-stakes adventure until that gentle joke about laser pointers from the first act seems like it comes from a totally different movie than the one that almost lets its canine protagonists drown in the East River twice. Much of the second act consists of a series of chase scenes as Max and Duke run from a gang of renegade former pets flushed into the NYC sewer system led by a adorable-but-psychotic white rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart) whos intent on killing all humans. Max and Dukes friends come looking for them in the sewers the ""Flushed Pets"" chase them out and so on until the rabbit is barreling in a stolen MTA bus across the Brooklyn Bridge. Its kind of like Toy Story--or any of the other Pixar movies that follow the same formula--but with tattooed pigs instead of mutant toys. Cinco Paul Ken Daurio and Brian Lynchs script includes some clever observations on the dynamic between animals and humans and some funny lines ""for the grownups"" without relying too heavily on the dreaded dirty double entendre. (At one point Max tells Duke hes a ""bad dog"" though he hesitates to call him this because its ""an insult to our species."") Thats not to say there arent poop and pee jokes or Looney Tunes-style slapstick pratfalls. Its a kids movie one made by the director of both Despicable Me movies Chris Renaud and the production designer of same Yarrow Cheney. But again most of these lines are concentrated in the films first half. As it progresses The Secret Life Of Pets starts to overreach dramatically and loses some of its charm in the process. It should have taken a cue from YouTube and realized that you really dont need much more than a cat and a vacuum cleaner to make people smile. Share Tweet Filed Under Film Louis C.K.

EntertainmentMovies Secret Life of Pets unleashes the cuteness but strays off path Originally published July 7 2016 at 1200 am Updated July 7 2016 at 1252 pm Movie review of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" Somewhere along the way the animated film becomes less of a quirky animal comedy and more of a very long standard-issue chase scene. Rating 2-and-a-half out of 4 stars. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Just what exactly do our pets do while were away? Thats the potentially delightful premise for ""The Secret Life of Pets"" an animated comedy starring an assortment of four-footed New Yorkers whose owners are at work all day. My own cat seems to pass the time by plotting ways to open closet doors and thus wallow luxuriously in folded sweaters. Pets in this movie during its adorable opening minutes scheme to extract a roast chicken from the fridge (a rather portly cat); use an electric mixer as a back massager (a wiener dog); watch telenovelas (a fluffy Pomeranian); throw a headbanging party (an otherwise sedate French poodle); and fly in front of a video-game screen pretending its a vast landscape (a not-so-caged bird). And some like the good-dog terrier Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) sit sadly at the door waiting for their favorite person to return. Max the hero of this story adores his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) -- even when she brings another rescue dog the shambling good-hearted Duke (Eric Stonestreet) home to share their cozy apartment. Max isnt at all sure what he thinks of Duke but soon the two become a team joining forces against a fast-talking conniving bunny (Kevin Hart) whos out to take over the city with an army of abandoned pets. Somewhere along the way alas ""The Secret Life of Pets"" becomes less of a quirky animal comedy and more of a very long standard-issue chase scene as we zoom through Manhattan with Max Duke and their gang of hangers-on. The plot at one point takes a pointless wrong turn toward Pixar-style poignancy (it misses by a mile); a development aptly described by my 11-year-old assistant as ""sad and a little bit annoying."" And the 3D as is far too often the case adds only to the ticket price not to the experience. Movie Review 1/2   The Secret Life of Pets with the voices of Louis C.K. Eric Stonestreet Kevin Hart Jenny Slate Ellie Kemper Lake Bell Dana Carvey Hannibal Buress Bobby Moynihan Steve Coogan and Albert Brooks. Directed by Chris Renaud from a screenplay by Cinco Paul Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch. 95 minutes. Rated PG for action and some rude humor. Several theaters. Too bad; theres a funny offbeat movie lurking in the details here. The stray observations about dogs and cats feel just right (a cat tells an object that ""Im going to bat you around for hours in a game only I understand"") the lollipop colors of the city are charming and the voicework witty.

(Do dogs just have better agents?) In ""The Secret Life of Pets"" the many dogs are for the most part honest and heroic; the few cats are if not entirely evil certainly sly and self-absorbed. Perhaps my cat could work on a cat-centered rewrite of this movies script -- if she ever gets any spare time. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

The same principle applies to all of you who see The Secret Life of Pets an animated fluffball that does everything to drive you crazy and ends up by being totally irresistible. Have you ever imagined what your pet does when you leave the house? Then this is the movie for you. Chris Renaud (Despicable Me) and his co-director Yarrow Cheney pull out all the stops in the too-busy script by Cinco Paul Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch (Minions). Sometimes you wish theyd pull back a little on the throttle. But they know how to use this Toy Story with critters to get loads of laughs  and put a lump in your throat. More News Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones How Jenny Slate Went From SNL Outcast to Obvious Child Success The Last Word Louis C.K. on Fatherhood Boston Trump Kevin Harts Funny Business All Stories >> Related 40 Greatest Animated Movies Ever From Pixar landmarks to cyberpunk anime and stop-motion indies -- our top non-live-action films and toons of all time The story starts simply when Katie (voiced by Ellie Kemper) disrupts her domestic bliss with her Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C.K.) by bringing home a BFG of a mutt named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) . Chaos ensues. The pooches go at each other to the delight of other pets who watch through the windows of their New York apartment building. They include Gidget (Jenny Slate) a white Pomeranian with a crush on Max and Chloe (Lake Bell) a snob cat with a mouth on her. Oh yeah these pets talk like crazy They also band together when needed especially when Duke gets lost and Max leads a chase to find them. Its a scary world out there and not just because of feral beasties and animal-control brigades. Gidget asks help from the unlikeliest places such as Tiberius (Albert Brooks) a predatory hawk and Pops (Dana Carvey) a limping Bassett Hound. But the fiercest adversary comes in the form of a coalition of abandoned animals called the Flushed Pets. As led by a street-talking rabbit named Snowball  (a vocal comic tour de force from Kevin Hart) -- he only looks sweet and cuddly -- the  Flushed Pets are hellbent  on the destruction of humans. Yes the movie goes a little dark at times especially when we meet Snowballs scary crew in the sewers (the films animation high point). Also in the pileup of fur and feathers you may forget who is who -- not to worry however since the action and laughs are nonstop. Theres also a scene that shows pet owners coming home at the end of the day to embrace the animals whove entered their lives to wreak havoc but also to give them a rare shot at unconditional love.

MUST CREDIT Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures Photo Illumination Entertainment And Universal Pictures How pets cut loose when the humans arent looking 1 / 2 Back to Gallery New York looks perfect in ""The Secret Life of Pets"" with the leaves on the trees turning vibrant shades of red and orange and the temperature apparently a breezeless 72 degrees. Its the ""Friends"" version of the city -- NYC as seen through a litter-free TV soundstage in Los Angeles. The idyllic landscape in the animated ""Pets"" sets the tone for an appealing escapist summer movie. The story is weak but the characters are strong benefiting from sharply written humor. The cynical edge to the jokes undercuts any chance of thoughtful lesson learning but the film is still suitable family entertainment. Its likely no one will remember this movie in 50 years but that doesnt mean we cant enjoy it now. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" comes from Illumination Entertainment which made the very solid ""Despicable Me"" before mining the franchise with diminishing returns in ""Despicable Me 2"" and ""Minions."" (A crowd-pleasing ""Minions"" short precedes the new film.) ""Pets"" doesnt quite have the heart of ""Despicable Me"" but Chris Renaud a director of both repeats the subversive and quirky comic beats. The conceit in this one When pet owners are away animals sneak around their apartment building throwing parties forming support groups and chatting with the gerbil who has been lost in the heating ducts for three weeks. Louis C.K. voices Max a pampered Jack Russell terrier whose perfect life is interrupted when a bearlike Newfoundland named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) moves into their small apartment. Their scheming against each other puts them both in peril and they must work together to get back home. Its good that they take their time because the best moments are on the road. Kevin Hart is particularly entertaining as a revolutionary rabbit leading an underground army of pets who have been abandoned by their owners. Dana Carvey is perfectly cast as an aging paralyzed and hilariously unfiltered basset hound. Dozens more pets show up for just a line or two with characteristics designed so animal lovers in the audience will nod their head in ""My pet does that"" recognition. A Chihuahua shivers and urinates when excited. The cats in contrast to devoted dogs act indifferent toward their owners. (This inside joke comes from some lonely sea monkeys flushed to the sewer ""Hey it isnt our fault we didnt look like the ad"") The city is a well-imagined alternate reality with exaggerated skyscrapers stretching into the stratosphere which is what they must look like to a pug or a tabby cat. The animation is more static than the shifting weather patterns and roiling seascapes of ""The Good Dinosaur"" or ""Finding Dory"" but the result is also less effort to watch. All energy is focused on joke telling which is fine for those of us with no tears left after ""Dory"" and ""The BFG."" The action set pieces in ""Pets"" are less exciting borrowing liberally from ""The Lego Movie"" and lesser ""Jurassic Park"" movies. Whatever perils emerge it never feels like theres much at stake. The most menacing bad guys are a pair of bumbling dogcatchers who in reality would be the quickest route to getting Max and Duke back to their owner. (The most stressed youll feel in ""Pets"" is when Duke comes home and starts clomping around the floor on his woolly mammoth paws. Theres no way the landlord is going to go for that and who knows if the place is rent-controlled ...) ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is the kind of movie that looks best condensed into a 21/2-minute highlight reel. Its the kind of movie that produces an A-plus trailer and then you arrive to find youve already heard 40 percent of the jokes. But laughs are laughs whether you know some of the punch lines ahead of time or not. And ""The Secret Life of Pets"" has plenty of laughs.

Hes used to being the center of attention until Katie takes in a stray named Duke whom he instantly despises. Kevin Hart voices deranged bunny Snowball and Louis C.K. is pampered terrier mix Max in The Secret Life of Pets.(Photo Illumination Entertainment Universal Pictures)Dogs and cats living together equals mass hysteria and adding in lizards and pigs hijacking cars turns everyday situations entertainingly nutty in The Secret Life of Pets.Animals seemingly mundane existences spawn high adventure and constant action in the animated comedy ( out of four; rated PG; in theaters nationwide Friday) where even the jokes about dog poop and rabbit droppings are surprisingly smart. Directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney Secret Life anchors itself on an oh-so-familiar concept but sparkles most when imagining some of its crazier shenanigans such as a poodle headbanging to heavy metal or a dachshund using an electric mixer as a scratching device.USA TODAYReview Steven Spielberg conjures a little magic for BFGA terrier named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) lives the sweet life in Manhattan with his loving owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). When shes gone to work he hangs with a posse of friends including Pomeranian love interest Gidget (Jenny Slate) forever-lost guinea pig Norman (Renaud) and chubby kitty Chloe (Lake Bell).His reality gets rocked when Katie brings home an oversized mutt named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) whom Max deems ""the death of all good things."" Soon the duo are on their own when they run afoul of freakish feline Ozone (Steve Coogan) and Snowball (Kevin Hart) a cute and very psychotic bunny who detests any ""scent of domestication"" and heads up an underground movement to take down mankind.Ozone (center voiced by Steve Coogan) is an alley cat with an attitude in The Secret Life of Pets. (Photo Illumination Entertainment Universal Pictures)The way home for Max and Duke involves avoiding pesky animal-control guys hopping a ferry to Brooklyn and enjoying a heavenly fever dream at a sausage factory -- think Oscar Mayer meets Busby Berkeley. The story meanders in spots especially when Maxs pals get embroiled in the chaos but closes strong as the two figure out theyre not just mans best friend but also each others.The sheer number of crazy critters will keep the littlest audience members enthralled. The hawk Tiberius (Albert Brooks) is in great need of a mission Pops (Dana Carvey) steals quite a few scenes as an aging basset hound on wheels and there are miscellaneous hamsters snakes and alligators who all add lively details to the busy plot.USA TODAYGo behind the scenes of The Secret Life of PetsParents though will appreciate the clever screenplay by Cinco Paul Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch that taps into the nature of these beasts. Chloe is winningly passive aggressive -- as any self-respecting cat would be -- and Snowball lets Hart tap into the high-energy vocal antics of his live-action work that somehow seem more natural coming out of the mouth of a cartoon rabbit.Secret Life also subtly weaves in how much a pet means to its owner and vice versa and in quasi-Pixar fashion reminds that theres nothing like that love especially when things go absolutely to the dogs.In this image released by Universal Pictures Buddy voiced by Hannibal Buress appears in a scene from ""The Secret Lives of Pets.""

"Review Secret Life of Pets imagines cats dogs and bunnies when their humans are out - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Secret Life of Pets imagines cats dogs and bunnies when their humans are outBy Sandy Cohen  Associated PressPosted 07/05/2016 015320 PM PDTUpdated 07/06/2016 045435 PM PDT Anyone who has ascribed deep thought or carefully plotted intentions to our furry or feathered friends with will relate to the imagination behind ""The Secret Life of Pets.""It may not have the emotional resonance of a Pixar movie but its playful premise endearing performances and outstanding score by Alexandre Desplat make ""Pets"" fun family fare. Peoples favorite nonspeaking companions are brought to life by Illumination Entertainment (the studio behind ""Despicable Me"") and given their voices by an all-star cast featuring Louis C.K. Kevin Hart Jenny Slate and Albert Brooks. ""Pets"" continues down the path set by Pixar two decades ago in ""Toy Story"" Two would-be rivals fighting for the love of their owner are forced to unite for a common cause.The little terrier Max (C.K.) is the top dog in the life of his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) and a leader among the other pets in their New York City apartment building including the neighboring Pomeranian Gidget (Slate) and the fat cat next door Chloe (Lake Bell). But his exalted position is threatened when Katie brings home a giant fluffy mutt named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and Max and Duke instantly become rivals. They try to sabotage each other when they get separated from their dog walker and captured by animal control -- the start of an adventure in the animal underworld led by a bitter bunny named Snowball (Hart) who has organized the citys ""flushed pets"" (those abandoned by their owners) into a team. Their motto is ""Liberated forever domesticated never.""Advertisement Max and Duke try to fit in but Snowball soon notes ""Youve got the scent of domestication all over you."" So he sends his army of rogue animals after them and at one point even steals a bus. Meanwhile the other pets from Max and Dukes building notice the two are missing and set out to find them. Gidget who has a not-so-secret crush on Max leads a menagerie that includes Chloe the cat Mel the pug Buddy the dachshund and a guinea pig named Norman. And they enlist the help of Tiberius the hawk (Brooks) and Pops (Dana Carvey) a wheelchair-bound basset hound who knows every animal in New York.Desplats jazzy score ratchets up the urgency and excitement as the chase through the city goes into full swing and the clever animation spotlights the quirkiness of animal behavior. Though the films anthropomorphized stars speak English and operate electronic devices they retain some recognizable animal characteristics too. When Pops wants guests at one of his famous parties to go home for example he turns on the vacuum cleaner. Dogs in hot pursuit of their friends are suddenly distracted by butterflies. And Buddys movements are especially amusing as he navigates his elongated body around corners and down stairs. Its fun to imagine what mischief pets could get into when their humans arent home and ""Pets"" does a great job of taking that idea to an extreme. And we all thought Fluffy and Fido just spend the day napping.

Pets are easily distracted you see. And you know who else is easily distracted? Kids. And actually audiences in general. The Secret Life of Pets is an ADD-addled mess of a movie -- and that amazingly is its charm.It was made by the same collective of animators and writers responsible for the Despicable Me series and Minions who manage to blend a cool angular midcentury design aesthetic with a kind of direct infantile honesty; their images are refined their jokes gloriously stupid. That simplicity of approach ensures that Pets stays true to its basic concept When the owners of New York Citys dogs and cats and birds and hamsters leave for the day their animals come out to play -- and chaos ensues. You could say its Toy Story with pets -- or Finding Nemo with land animals -- but that wouldnt quite do justice to its vivid hellraising cacophony.There is an actual story though its a rough one serving mainly as an excuse to justify a bunch of disconnected jokes and set pieces. Vivacious Jack Russell terrier Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) who calls himself ""the luckiest dog in New York"" has his deep attachment to owner Katie challenged when she brings home Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a big hairy lug of a mutt. Suddenly Maxs easy life -- one spent waiting at home while chatting away with his pals in the apartment complex including Gidget (Jenny Slate) the white Pomeranian secretly in love with him and Chloe (Lake Bell) a snooty tabby -- feels like it might be on shaky ground.The war of attrition between Max and Duke escalates until one day the desperate Duke attempting to abandon his smaller rival during a day out with the dog-walker manages to get both of them lost. The duos ensuing episodic adventure involves cockney alley cats Animal Control and an anarchist collective called the Flushed Pets who are led by a deranged rabbit (Kevin Hart) and inhabit a subterranean realm guarded by vipers and giant crocodiles. Sound surreal? The whole film is a relentless cavalcade of weirdness tattooed pigs strung-out lizards piranhas and one particularly hallucinatory musical number set in a sausage factory filled with hordes of dancing soon-to-be-consumed wieners. EXPAND Courtesy of Universal Pictures Dont look for any through-lines cause there arent any. The rivalry between Max and Duke dissipates early on -- I wont say its resolved because its mostly just forgotten. Theres some brief business about ""finding your inner wolf"" which is abandoned within 30 seconds. The tone is all over the place. Wild slapstick leads to spurts of sentiment. There are even a couple of deaths stuffed in there amid all that vivacious chasing and jumping and yelling and careening. But again the all-over-the-place-ness has a weird integrity. Its almost like youre watching everything unfold at the speed at which the filmmakers are imagining it digesting the jokes as quickly as they can think them up. Nothing feels calculated about this film -- which is something of an achievement since animated movies famously take years (and tens of millions of dollars) to produce. Of course just because something feels uncalculated doesnt actually mean it is. The folks behind this film know exactly what theyre doing as they did something similar with the entertainingly silly Minions last year which came on the heels of Pixars impeccably scripted and structured (and ultimately Oscar-winning) hit Inside Out. Minions still managed to clean up at the box office earning more than 1 billion worldwide. With this new film theyre obviously hoping for a similar success. This time their adult-friendly foil is Pixars powerful acclaimed and immensely successful Finding Dory - to which Pets will surely provide an engagingly dumb vaguely down-market alternative.The calculation doesnt end there. The story keeps threatening to go dark but always pulls back just in time. The conflict between the kill-all-humans anarchist pets and the domesticated ones for example hints at something more uncomfortable -- though never quite uncomfortable enough to ever feel like more than a grace note. I was reminded throughout of George Millers masterful expensive 1998 sequel Babe Pig in the City; now there was a kids film about runaway animals in a big metropolis that actually dared to go to some nerve-racking places. It was a work of art ... and as it so happens a financial disaster that nearly collapsed its studio Universal. The Secret Life of Pets is also a Universal release and it feels like theyve finally cracked the code on making a silly-animals movie thats just deranged enough to keep you watching yet harmless enough not to truly offend anyone. It may not be a work of art but its crazed zigzagging energy is something to behold.

New York City goes to the dogs... and the cats... and the bunnies... Directors Chris Renauld Yarrow Cheney. PG (130) Area theaters opening July 8 Heres something dog people and cat people can agree on ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is hilarious sweet and as fun for parents as the brats they take with them to the movies. The premise of the computer-animated film is pretty simple - what exactly do our animals get up to when their human owners go off to work. And if Illumination Entertainment - the animation studio behind the ""Despicable Me"" movies - is to be believed our domesticated critters are throwing raucous ragers partying plotting and getting into all sorts of trouble including street fighting and carjacking. Max (voiced by Louis CK) is a rescue terrier living a charmed New York City life with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) until she decides to bring home Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a gigantic hairy beast of a dog Max sees as a threat to his perfect only-child dynamic. Antics ensue and Duke and Max soon find themselves lost in the city and stripped of their collars after a run-in with some tough alley cats. Things get worse for the pair when they narrowly dodge animal control and meet Snowball an adorable little bunny (Kevin Hart) -- who turns out to be a gritty and hilarious leader of a massive underground gang of former pets bent on revolution against humans. Snakes seamonkeys fish a pig cats and birds populate the underbelly - a collection of fringe fur balls and reptiles. SEE IT Man builds mini Jurassic Park for his pet tortoise ""All of us have suffered at the hand of humans. They say the loves us then the throw us out"" Snowball passionately proclaims. ""Its not our fault we dont look like the ad"" a couple Seamonkeys exclaim. While the domesticated duo convince Snowball they also hate humans - even though all they want to do is go home - they weasel their way into his critter cult only to pull out of an initiation that involves a viper bite. Pampered terrier mix Max (LOUIS C.K.) and angry bunny Snowball (KEVIN HART) are surprisingly good in The Secret Life of Pets. (Credit Illumination Entertainme) The fur starts to fly for Max and Duke once they accidentally kill the viper angering Snowball and his crew who chase them through the sewers into the river and finally all the way to Brooklyn. ""They say everyone is going to Brooklyn"" Snowballs porcine friend exclaims as the pair cross the East River in search of Max and Duke. ""Im not talking about hipster real estate trends"" Snowball deadpans. Led by Gidget (a dizzy-in-love telenovela-watching fluffy American Eskimo dog voiced by Jenny Slate) Maxs building friends mobilize for a rescue. Those furries are voiced by a veteran cast that includes Albert Brooks Hannibal Burress and Dana Carvey. Along the way unlikely friendships are formed many sausages are eaten and theres a Brooklyn Bridge chase sequence that feels every bit as exciting as an action movie. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" isnt all laughs and thrills. It makes the case for how people treat pets - humans are known to flush unwanted snakes or fish and ""free"" birds or rabbits - albeit through a very hyper Hart in the shape of a tiny bucktoothed cottontail. But its a good lesson for kids and the adults who purchase the animals. Parents should know theres some talk of death a deadly viper attack and a few other little bits that arent all warm and fuzzy. But its no secret the ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a hilarious account of the relationship we have with our animals and a gentle reminder to treat them with love and respect.

Stranger things have happened but there it is.  ""The Secret Life of Pets"" moves like a bat out of hell from frame one though if youre looking for any kind of emotion you might be barking up the wrong tree. READ MORE Watch Cats And Dogs Are On The Run In New Trailer For The Secret Life Of Pets Comparisons to ""Toy Story"" will no doubt abound not least because both films ask the same basic question -what do our playthings do when were not around to see them? -- with the same winking glee. Whats more both ""The Secret Life of Pets"" and the first entry in Pixars soon to be four strong franchise are animated by a shared basic tension. Both films are built on a rivalry between a king-in-his-castle prodigal son and a new interloper a seeming competitor for top-gun number-one status in the masters eye. That top dog is Max a boisterous terrier voiced by Louis C.K who gives a family clean high-energy riff on his scrappy everyman (err dog) persona. Max lives in Manhattans most pet friendly apartment building with owner Katie (Ellie Kemper chirpy but barely used) and horde of neighboring domesticated beasts. Theres Mel the pug (Bobby Moynihan) Chloe the tabby cat (Lake Bell) and Gidget (Jenny Slate) the eskimo dog with feelings for our lead. Were introduced to all of them -and many more--in a fast paced opening sequence. Filled with sight gags stupid pet tricks and set to an up tempo Alexandre Desplat score it nimbly sets the scene showing us what fun happens when the masters leave and the pets come out to play. Of course Maxs good times arent meant to last and they come to a decisive halt the day owner Katie brings home Duke. The wooly mongrel voiced by Eric Stonestreet poses an immediate threat to Maxs status quo and be it through expert editing or some larger alchemic bond the two performers share a snappy antagonistic chemistry. But that snappy antagonism and the escalating feud it boosts soon lands our two canine leads lost in the streets of New York collars gone and Animal Control nipping at their paws. At this point barely 15 minutes in the already fleet-footed story kicks into overdrive. READ MORE Horace and Pete Why Louis C.K. is Very Very Sad the Series is Ending Directors Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney aided by screenwriters Brian Lynch Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio pile on situation after situation new character after new character. The Flushed Pets - a band of sewer dwelling revolutionaries led by evil rabbit Kevin Hart - also join the chase. Meanwhile Gidget Mel and company assemble a team to bring them home bringing into the fray too many comedians and character actors to mention (Albert Brooks as an impulse-impaired hawk is a standout). There are the requisite film homages and references (""The Fugitive"" an obvious go to ""Some Like It Hot"" less so) to keep the adults happy and the parkour-performing wiener dog is just pure fun. If it all sounds totally overstuffed well it totally is. And if the films breakneck pace keeps all those balls in the air without too much strain it does so at the expense of character investment and emotional payoff. In that sense in overdrive those Pixar similarities are left in the dust. Hardly a throughline through the manic energy that central tension between Max and Duke gets lost amid the comedy chase sequences and action setpieces. Which isnt to say that any of those are poorly done. Quite the contrary Renaud Cheney and their Illumination animators work at peak technical expertise. Colors pop off the screen the golden light of New York in autumn beckons in the background the elaborate set-pieces are choreographed with maximum Rube Goldberg invention. Only with such quantity and velocity in action the only thing youre really left with -- once you catch your breath and the credits roll -- is a general appreciation of the way Renaud and company animate fur or make the waves the Hudson roar to life. It may be technically impeccable but its something less than a feeling. Grade B- ""The Secret Life of Pets"" opens in theaters on Friday July 8.

Front-loading the best bits The Secret Life of Pets begins by imagining what the animals in a New York apartment block get up to when their owners shut the door in the morning. A handsome poodle named Leonard switches on the stereo so he can headbang to hard rock. A puffy little white Pomeranian swoons in front of daytime soaps. A sausage dog gives himself a back rub with a food blender. And mongrel Max (voiced by comedian Louis CK) loyally waits by the door for his human to come home. So far so Pixar. But things get more conventional when Maxs owner brings home an addition to the family - a slobbering rescue dog called Duke. Its not long before the two mutts are lost in the city falling foul of a gang of animals rejected by their owners and reduced to living in the sewers. The gangs leader is an adorable evildoing bunny called Snowball - as villains go he feels a bit try-hard (and not nearly as twisted as teddy bear Lots-O-Huggin in Toy Story 3). There are some funny-sweet observations about pets and our projections on to them. And the animation is expressive (though cat Chloe is not nearly cold-hearted and sociopathic enough for a mog). But the manic pace piling on the action sequences is exhausting. Still what a savvy stroke-of-genius idea for a film this is. In cities like London New York and Shanghai where spiralling property prices have created Generation Rent pet ownership is declining. We need to get our animal fix somewhere.

As the title indicates the story is about what pets get up to whilst their owners are out.  It is a bit like a mammal version of finding Nemo at times.

Just an entertaining cute film for the little ones.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 26 2016Alexandra LTastemakerFeaturedToy Story shared with us what our toys got up to when we left the room and picking up on that theme Secret Life of Pets reveals to us the lives our pets inhabit when we close the door on them each morning and trot off to work. From the studio who gave us the Minions - a fact I will always be fervently grateful for - comes a film that ranks high on the cute factor and super high on the feel-good factor. Book-ended by brilliant montages of the pets of New York City as they are bade farewell and then hugged hello to this film introduces us to Max a lovable mongrel whose cosy life with his human Katie is thrown into turmoil when she brings home Duke an elephant sized furball to share the apartment with. Escaping from a dog walk one day we follow Max amp; Duke on their journey home as theyre assisted by a motley crew of dogs cats hamsters and birds all of whom help them avoid the clutches of the worlds most streetwise bunny a tattooed pot-belly and a van-driving gecko. The best things here come from Kevin Harts Snowball a rabbit with a nice line in carrot key carpentry whose legions of flushed pets fill the sewers Lake Bells Chloe the cat in whom I saw my own always-hungry-self alarmingly reflected back at me and Steve Coogans vaguely terrifying but ultimately hysterical flea-bitten moggy Ozone. Depending what animals you grew up with youll find your favourite on screen here - theres no pug in the world I wont ever find ridiculously entertaining - and some are definitely more entertaining than others; even charming animation fails to make eight legged arachnids cute. The animation is fantastic and you can see how much research the cast amp; crew did on specific animal traits and although its rated a U there is a scene that might disturb anyone (big or small) whos wary of snakes. Keep an eye out for a sausage factory scene that will forever change the way you view a wiener I loved the relationships depicted between the pets and their owners and if youre living in a city at the moment where space amp; time prevents you from having a furry companion of your own this will twinge at your heart and make you desperate to pat anything on a lead in the street afterwards. The script is smartly written if not quite as funny or adult-centric as the recent Zootropolis and while Minions still takes the gold in terms of tears-rolling-down-the-cheek hilarity Pets holds a very respectable silver. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 20 2016charlotte_sometimestastemakerFeaturedAnswering that eternal question What do our pets get up to when were at work?The answer is lots of adventures that are slightly too reminiscent of Toy Story. One is about what toys get up to whilst humans are away the latter film is about what pets get up to whilst humans are away.The love-hate dynamics of the central duo were not necessarily invented by Pixar (theres about 100 years of cinema prior that utilises the trope at various points) but there are lots of similarities between Max amp; Woody and Duke amp; Buzz. Both Max amp; Woody have spoiled lifestyles being the centre of attention of their owners. Duke amp; Buzz are both the invaders of the aforementioned comfortable lifestyle. Theres a clash between resident and newcomer which leads to them being far from home they are kidnapped by an evil-doer and must unite to get back home.This wouldnt be too problematic if The Secret Life of Pets put a fresh take on it but it doesnt. Some of the gags and plot-points are overly familiar with the film drifting from scene to scene without any sense of urgency. The film opens well if with a sequence that has become far too familiar courtesy of the trailers which have been showing for the past year yet becomes worn-out rather quickly. The film has a weird blend of realistic and pantomime the later accelerates as the film rushes to its climax never finding the balance and never sitting quite right.The film looks brilliant has some funny moments and some lovely characters. Its not particularly original but will more than entertain most of the family.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-secret-life-of-pets,200,thesecretlifeofpets40,thesecretlifeofpets,timeout

TWITTER 7/8/2016 Louis C.K. Kevin Hart and Eric Stonestreet lend their voices to this latest romp from the team behind Despicable Me and Minions. Fetching up a new twist on the tried and tested talking-animal genre The Secret Life of Pets explores what happens when we close the front door and leave our dogs cats and canaries to their own devices. The answer as any recent CG animation flick could tell you is that our pets act a lot like us with their own petty quibbles indulgences love affairs music tastes and desire to do what they please at all times -- although a dog is a dog and will still run after a stick if you toss one in its direction. Thats at least half the story in this latest comic romp from director Chris Renaud and Illumination Entertainment -- the team behind the ultra-successful Despicable Me and Minions movies -- and its certainly the more enjoyable part of a film that starts off impressively but gradually tires itself out with a loud and loopy caper plot taking a clever idea to mostly familiar places in the long run. Funny in stretches but capable of making you feel like youve dropped MDMA and locked yourself inside Petco for several hours this big-ticket Universal release should play like catnip for kids starting summer vacation though its unlikely to dig up the massive 1 billion bone of this years other anthropomorphic blockbuster Zootopia. Set in a fever-dream version of modern-day Manhattan thats part Vincent Minnelli part Andreas Gursky the story (by regular Renaud scribes Ken Daurio Cinco Paul and Brian Lynch) focuses on a whiny little terrier Max (Louis C.K.) whose pitch-perfect apartment-bound lifestyle is upended when his owner comes home with a big floppy rescue named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and forces them to become housemates. Unable to accept the fact that hes not the only loved one in town Max soon finds himself stranded alongside Duke in the Big Apple where theyre pursued by dogcatchers and cross paths with an underground resistance known as the Flushed Pets whose goal is to make all animals undomesticated for good. Their leader Snowball (Kevin Hart) is the most psychotic furry little wabbit to ever chomp on a carrot and when he finds out Max is not the stray he claims to be he brings the ruckus down hard. Renaud dishes out some decent gags during the opening reels especially when introducing us to the other pets in Maxs building including a lazy house cat (Lake Bell) an overzealous pug dog (Bobby Moynihan) and a fluffy Pomeranian (Jenny Slate) who has the hots for our hero. Much of the humor comes from the fact that these animals have extremely human characteristics while remaining adorable little critters even if not all of them aim to please their caretakers in the way that Max always does. But there are many more castmembers to come including a kvetching hawk (Albert Brooks) a Cockney-accented alley cat (Steve Coogan) and a sly old Basset Hound (Dana Carvey) with the most bodacious bachelor pad in the city -- to name some of several additional characters that wind up crowding the screen for the sake of a few short laughs. Like the professional dogwalker who cant exactly keep count of Max and his cohorts it feels like the filmmakers are juggling too many chatty creatures at once while trying to maintain a plot that tends to grow more outlandish as the story progresses. Occasionally all the fuss results in a memorable set-piece -- such as a digression into a sausage factory that nods to both Grease and a Busby Berkley musical -- but by the time the third act rolls around the cacophony grows exhausting and the laughs become rarer especially when all the action-movie antics take over. On the technical side there are some marvels here -- especially Renauds vision of a vertically exuberant New York City with skyscrapers stretching beyond the frame and fire escapes leading forever upwards into different apartments and different lives as if were seeing everything from the viewpoint of a dog watching the world of humans from the ground. Likewise all the details of the furry and feathered cast including all of the fur itself are impressively rendered by the Illumination team who have created a lively and colorful palette that recalls Technicolor films of the 1950s. The same goes for the score by Alexandre Desplat (The Imitation Game) which takes notes from Breakfast at Tiffanys and other classic Manhattan-set movies offering up a playful accompaniment to what ultimately feels like a smart but overindulgent exercise in computer-generated puppy love. Or maybe thats just a pet peeve. Distributor Universal Production companies Illumination Entertainment Illumination Mac Guff Universal Pictures International Cast Louis C.K.

In what may as well be Illuminations answer to ""Toy Story"" ""The Secret Life of Pets"" imagines how domesticated animals behave while their owners backs are turned concentrating on a dynamic where newly adopted dog Duke (""Modern Family"" star Eric Stonestreet in the Buzz Lightyear role) disrupts the balance in a household where Max (Louis C.K. as the Woody equivalent) had previously been his humans best friend. The formula may be familiar but the personalities are completely fresh yielding a menagerie of loveable -- if downright ugly -- cartoon critters banding together to help these two incompatible roommates from ending up on the streets.SEE MORE Annecy Film Festival Based on an original idea by Illumination honcho Chris Meledandri ""Pets"" is the studios most accomplished feature from both a story and animation standpoint tapping into an endlessly expandable core concept -- which could conceivably be repeated ad infinitum ideally with an entirely new domesticated ensemble each time out. Not that theres anything wrong with these particular animals apart from the fact that they all look just a little bit off as if someone took the runt of each litter and pumped them full of Cheez Whiz. Humans already have a tendency to anthropomorphize their pets and here tapping into that wish we all share to know whats going on in our animals heads screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (who have co-authored all of Illuminations features except ""Minions"") along with Brian Lynch (who wrote ""Minions"") take that impulse to the extreme imbuing these critters with the ability to speak -- along with a host of other behaviors that would normally require opposable thumbs and a fair understanding of modern electronics. The instant their owners leave for work the pets drop the obedient routine and revert back to their true selves -- the farther that might be from their actual disposition the better. Theres the poodle who spends his afternoons headbanging to heavy metal for example and theres Chloe (Lake Bell) the otherwise lazy cat who freely helps herself to whatevers in the fridge. Maybe it would all be a little too easy on audiences if the pet characters were any cuter whereas any animal enthusiast can tell you its the disposition that matters. In most cases the bond between owner and pet is too strong to dwell on deformities whether its a crooked ear or missing limb. For instance Max is a relatively ordinary terrier type whose four spindly little legs hardly seem adequate to support his top-heavy body but Katie (Ellie Kemper) loves him all the same while woolly brown Duke looks entirely too dirty to hug like the Snuffaluffagus with a nose job. No wonder both have complexes about being abandoned -- which is ironically what lands the two dogs locked out of their cushy apartment and at the mercy of feral cats animal control officers and an army of abandoned former domestics known as the Flushed Pets (reminiscent of ""Toy Story"" neighbor Sids mutant toys). Bent on revenge the Flushed Pets are led by a street-smart bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart) whose cuddly appearance masks a ruthless personality -- a joke the film exploits on multiple occasions as when Maxs would-be girlfriend Gidget (Jenny Slate) a white powder puff of a Pomeranian switches into kung-fu mode. Though Maxs friends regularly stop by his apartment to hang out while Katies away for the day Gidgets the only one who actually notices his disappearance mobilizing a citywide search to find the pooch she wants to smooch. The city in question is New York which the good folks at Illumination have reimagined as a paradise of sorts for pets where everything from Central Park to Brooklyn is bathed in a perpetual magic-hour glow (interiors meanwhile are lit like sitcom sets with nary a corner in shadow). Beneath the streets its a different story and though plenty of toons have taken us into that domain before (""Ratatouille"" ""Flushed Away"" and ""The Boxtrolls"" to name just three examples from the last decade) Snowballs underground realm supplies the secret life farthest from our own imagining. There are a few stray crocodiles of course some forgotten ""Sea Monkeys"" and an enormous viper who is the kid-friendly films only casualty his hilarious death-by-overkill turning the Flushed Pets against Max and Duke. But in the sewers of the city we discover the consequences of those humans who dont follow through on their responsibilities to the animals they adopt which reinforces the urgency for our canine heroes to work out their differences and find their way home -- all blown up to larger-than-life proportions via composer Alexandre Desplats big bossy Gershwin-esque jazz-band score. Along the way the ensemble sprawls ever larger as Gidget recruits Tiberius (Albert Brooks) an ultra-predatory red-tailed hawk who can barely resist feasting on the various teacup breeds and a half-paralyzed old Bassett Hound named Pops (Dana Carvey) for her increasingly unwieldy search party. While the proliferation of side characters tends to distract from the budding friendship between Max and Duke at the center of the story each new critter offers an added window into the strange relationship between humans and their pets -- a seemingly inexhaustible source of humor of which director Chris Renaud (helming his fourth Illumination feature) has only started to scratch the surface. Just as Buzz and Woody did in ""Toy Story"" the characters go from attempting to elbow one another out of their owners life to realizing that they actually need one another. The movie never actually says as much but sharing the house with another dog makes a fine alternative to sitting by the front door all day waiting for the missing human to come home. While the Illumination formula invites far more humor into the mix than the relatively emotion-driven Pixar approach diving headlong into such comic set pieces as the fantasy sequence where Max and Duke visit the Sausage Kingdom factory the studio still hasnt quite figured out how to sell the sentimental side. At times ""The Secret Life of Pets"" feels like watching a marathon of silly animal tricks on YouTube when what we really want is to transported into the heads of those creatures whove brought such joy to our own lives and to experience that connection through their eyes. As usual the Minions have a way of stealing the show earning the films first laugh (via the four-minute ""Mower Minions"" short that precedes the feature) and disappearing until the final scene when the Bobby Moynihan-voiced Pug shows up in a dog-sized Minion costume -- a tiny taste of the pet-centric merch Illumination can expect to monopolize going forward.

Rowan Rosenblum says July 11 2016 at 943 am The Secret Life of Pets is basically a harmless movie. Its entertaining but I didnt think that much of it. It has a good voice cast except for Kevin Hart who was really annoying in this movie and I was upset because I usually really like the work he does. Also theres not much of a story and everything that happened was just pets acting crazy or wrecking everything and that was also disappointing because I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Illumination Entertainment havent made anything that good recently so hopefully there next movie ""Sing"" is like Despicable Me because thats Illuminations best work so far. In the end The Secret Life of Pets is decent-ish though it could have been better.
