Posted September 22 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Winter the dolphin the brave tailless hero of the 2011 original is all alone at Clearwater Marine Aquarium. So her human pals (including Harry Connick Jr.) find her a female companion in a bizarre narrative in which resourceful teens boss around Ph.D.s while Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman make smiley faces at them. This is innocuous heart-in-the-right-place family fare but its well-earned points about animal rights and preservation would be better taken if the relentless sentimentality didnt force viewers into flippers-in-the-air submission.

Watching an injured dolphin fight for survival was a heartwarming treat (and a surprise box-office hit) in 2011. Now the adorable quotient is raised thanks to two more dolphins. And just for good measure a sea turtle. PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Theyre all patients at the real-life Clearwater Marine Aquarium headed up by Dr. Clay (Harry Connick Jr.) and his eager-eyed young staff (including Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff both reprising their roles). Their new mission Pair the famed Winter -- still using her prosthetic tail -- with a female dolphin in her tank. (If they cant the United States Department of Agriculture will ship her out.) PHOTOS Stars at the Toronto Film Festival Its a flimsy story line and the film overcompensates with extended montages of the dolphins swimming in their habitat. (We get it. Theyre cute) Still with its important lessons of opportunity and hope the sequel makes for fine family entertainment. Plus Gamble and Zuehlsdorff have a nice natural screen presence and chemistry together. By Dolphin Tale 5 they might be planning their wedding day at the marina.

Sometimes its okay for a childrens film to be limited in aim and scope. Over the years weve gotten so used to outfits like Pixar and Disney wowing us with ostensible kiddie fare that blows up into something greater -- turning cute fables into dazzling metaphors lending cosmic significance to stories about magic toys or robots or whatever -- that a movie of modest ambitions seems like a letdown. Dolphin Tale 2 Lord knows wont rearrange anyones notion of childhood; you could probably recite most of the movie without having seen it. But theres room in the cinematic universe for all of these films and this one is appropriately heartwarming a well-crafted family flick that gets the job done then gets out of the way.A The first Dolphin Tale recounted the friendship that developed between our preteen hero Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) and Winter a tailless dolphin rescued and rehabilitated by the Clearwater Marine Aquarium a Tampa hospital for sick and injured animals run by Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) and his family. The new film opens with the rescue of another dolphin named Mandy found beached in shallow water with severe lesions and sunburn but it quickly settles back into a tale about Sawyer and Winter. The boy now in high school has been invited to join a 12-week college-level educational cruise called Sea Semester; he has his whole life ahead of him and a world waiting with open arms. The increasingly depressed Winter however can never leave the aquarium. Although Clearwater unlike places like SeaWorld has a strict policy of returning the animals it rehabilitates to the wild (its motto is ""Rescue rehab release"") this dolphin will always need to remain under supervision thanks to her prosthetic tail; she has to watch as other animals (and now humans like Sawyer) come and go. The dilemma is simple yet poetic. Along the way theres enough room in the episodic tale for a subplot about an injured sea turtle an annoying pelican (played by what must be the most talented bird in movie history) and some political back and forth about the future of the aquarium. Its all pretty simple stuff but director Charles Martin Smith (who used to be a fairly busy and pretty good actor) treats it all with care; the film is certainly sentimental but never cheaply so. A shot of divers approaching a dying dolphin at the bottom of a pool for example is heartbreaking in part because we realize that this is something that happens and that this is probably what it looks like when it does. Similarly in a film that posits that dolphins feel emotions just as complex as humans do Smith has the wisdom to try and show us what the dolphins might be feeling At one point as a sling is mechanically brought down to pick a wary Winter out of the pool so she can be fitted for a new prosthesis we see this ominous machine on the other side of the water through the animals eyes. The approach not only makes thematic sense it also conveys more suspense. Likewise a later scene where we watch two dolphins make contact for the first time one sniffing out the other to decide whether its a potential friend or rival benefits from Smiths willingness to try to show us what the dolphins themselves are seeing and feeling.Dolphin Tale 2 may seem like a slender unremarkable movie but I suspect it was harder to make than a lot of other films that get more attention; it surely cant be easy shooting a movie with this many kids and animals. And in a world full of cheapened bombastic entertainment aimed at children this modest honest little movie feels special in its own way.

"Review Dull Dolphin Tale 2 needs a rescue of its own - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Dull sequel Dolphin Tale 2 needs a rescue of its own Dolphin Tale 2 Wilson Webb / Warner Bros. Cozi Zuehlsdorff rear as Hazel Haskett and Nathan Gamble right as Sawyer Nelson in a scene from ""Dolphin Tale 2."" Cozi Zuehlsdorff rear as Hazel Haskett and Nathan Gamble right as Sawyer Nelson in a scene from ""Dolphin Tale 2."" (Wilson Webb / Warner Bros.) Gary Goldstein Only when hope arrives in the form of baby dolphin Hope does the Dolphin Tale 2 narrative pick up The main cast as well as the mammalian star of the 2011 hit family film ""Dolphin Tale"" return in ""Dolphin Tale 2"" a pleasant if bland and nonessential sequel.Like the original movie the follow-up is based on true events that occurred at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Florida where both pictures were shot. Unfortunately writer-director Charles Martin Smith (he also helmed the first film) never finds a gripping or dimensional enough story in the continuing account of Winter the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin with the prosthetic tail. The most potentially dramatic element -- Winter will be relocated by the Department of Agriculture if the team at Clearwater cant find her an acceptable companion dolphin -- takes too long to build and play out resulting in a lack of focus and momentum.Incidents involving an elderly dolphin Panama and a rescued dolphin named Mandy may factor into Winters situation but tend to feel like separate stories. Only much later when hope arrives in the form of a baby dolphin christened -- you guessed it Hope -- does the narrative begin to feel organic. The actors too often feel secondary to the stirringly shot dolphins and aquatic setting. Perhaps thats because their characters barely exist beyond their connection to the dolphins; theyre otherwise lifeless. Dolphin Tales star story and setting a life-changer for many Susan King Dolphin Tale and its sequel Dolphin Tale 2 star the prosthesis-wearing Winter who was rescued by Floridas Clearwater Marine Aquarium.

"Dolphin Tale sequel offers more fine family fare review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDolphin Tale sequel offers more fine family fare reviewDolphin Tale 2 follows the further adventures of Winter whos in desperate need of a companion in a film that offers good clean family fare.Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff star in Dolpin Tale 2.  (Wilson Webb / THE CANADIAN PRESS)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Sept. 11 2014Dolphin Tale 2Starring Harry Connick Jr. Nathan Gamble Cozi Zuehlsdorff. Co-written and directed by Charles Martin Smith. 107 minutes. At GTA theatres. G.In the first Dolphin Tale a certain cetacean was in desperate need of a tail a prosthetic one. In the sequel Winter desperately needs a new companion or risks being sent away from her home and friends at the Clearwater Marine Hospital.Article Continued BelowBoth films offer familiar faces growing up or getting older a certain amount of tension but mostly good clean family fare.Dolphin Tale 2 takes up pretty much where the last one left off though a few years have passed and young Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) is offered a great opportunity that involves leaving home.What should be an easy decision is complicated by the death of Panama Winters long-time pool mate. Along comes a kind but officious U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector (played by director/co-writer Charles Martin Smith) who gives Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) a tight deadline to find a replacement companion or have Winter sent away to some gosh-awful place far from the ocean.When a beached dolphin named Mandy is rescued the audience is all ""well that settles that."" But wait because if a dolphin can be fixed up and released back into the ocean it must. Its another teaching moment in a film that doesnt shy away from trying to educate its audience.Its only in the final throes that we know (as the movie trailer makes plain) that an orphaned baby dolphin named Hope may be the answer to everyones prayers. Hope hasnt learned enough about living in the ocean from her mother so shell never be released back another teaching moment.But will Hope bond with Winter or reject her for being different? Adults will know but kids are going to spend some uncomfortable moments waiting for the answer.Along the way we get some comic relief from Rufus the pelican who bonds with an injured sea turtle named Mavis and a chance to reacquaint ourselves from some familiar faces including Kris Kristofferson as Clays dad Ashley Judd as Sawyers mom and Morgan Freeman as the fin doctor all of whom seem to be there only because they were in the first one.And while young Gamble doesnt get top billing as Sawyer the film is mostly his and to a lesser extent Cozi Zuehlsdorff as Clays daughter Hazel both of whom are wonderfully youthful though their puppy love friendship is as uncontroversial as if they were brother and sister.Earnest and educational seem to be key to what Smith (American Graffitis memorable Terry the Toad) is trying to accomplish. Theres even a brief cameo by Bethany Hamilton as herself a respected surfer who lost an arm to a tiger shark. The message is clear that people who suffer adversity and dolphins like Winter who lost her tail are more than capable of rising above it.Theres some lovely underwater cinematography and a few dollops of suspense. But Dolphin Tale 2 is mostly an easy breezy ride that will please younger audiences and their parents with its message of resilience and hope.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Credit MCT / Wilson Webb advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A Florida aquariums beloved dolphin is in danger of being forcibly relocated. Rated PG (mild thematic elements). BOTTOM LINE Bland and predictable but the wildlife antics and mild suspense will entertain very young viewers. CAST Harry Connick Jr. Ashley Judd Morgan Freeman Nathan Gamble LENGTH 147 ""Dolphin Tale"" a severe case of inspiration overload from 2011 told the story of Winter a rescued bottlenose who survives the amputation of her tail thanks to an ingenious prosthetic device. With Morgan Freeman as the lovably gruff designer Dr. McCarthy plus a heart-tugging cast of Iraq War amputees ""Dolphin Tale"" was a true story that nevertheless felt like a false fantasy. The sequel ""Dolphin Tale 2"" follows in the first movies wake. It reunites its entire main cast at Floridas Clearwater Marine Aquarium where Winter -- once again playing herself -- is in trouble. The death of a companion has left the plucky dolphin alone in her tank a violation of USDA rules. A nitpicky bureaucrat (Charles Martin Smith who also wrote and directed) gives the staff an ultimatum Find a companion for Winter in 30 days or the government will claim her. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? Thats barely a story so ""Dolphin Tale 2"" pads its running time with subplots involving two young aquarium staffers. Hazel (an appealing Cozi Zuehlsdorff) is developing a crush on Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) but hes just been offered a spot on an exciting ocean voyage. A bland Harry Connick Jr. plays Hazels father and the aquariums founder Clay Haskett; Ashley Judd is Sawyers single mom; Kris Kristofferson dispenses folksy wisdom. Freeman is sidelined as Dr. McCarthy which means the interesting science experiments that enlivened the first movie are missing here. ""Dolphin Tale 2"" is both uneventful and predictable but it deserves credit for treating its nonhuman characters with respect. The movie repeatedly reminds us that Winter is a wild animal not a pet. At one point Clay must decide whether to release a rehabilitated dolphin back into the sea or keep her captive as a companion to Winter -- a difficult choice that young Hazel initially cannot understand. Her tearful scene is the closest this movie comes to something like drama. Otherwise ""Dolphin Tale 2"" is basically a cinematic kiddie pool shallow tepid and safe. 226 MoviesDolphin Tale 2 trailer PLOT A Florida aquariums beloved dolphin is in danger of being forcibly relocated. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (mild thematic elements) CAST Harry Connick Jr. Ashley Judd Morgan Freeman Nathan Gamble LENGTH 147 BOTTOM LINE Bland and predictable but the wildlife antics and mild suspense will entertain very young viewers. Movies25 big movies out this fall ----- Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff DOLPHINS MEMORY NO FLUKE TO KID STARS It had been three long years since Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff the two kids who befriended Winter the injured dolphin made ""Dolphin Tale"" with the worlds first dolphin with a prosthetic tail. Would Winter remember them for the sequel? You really dont know for sure Cozi says. But she and Nathan want to believe. ""There was a time when we were filming a pool scene where me and Winter were just chilling between takes in the water with a trainer"" says Nathan already a veteran child actor (The Dark Knight) when he was cast in the original film. ""I tilted my head to the left and Winter bubbled and let herself sink way down in the pool.

Pictures Nathan Gamble as Sawyer and Cozi Zuehlsdorff as Hazel with the dolphin Winter in Dolphin Tale 2 By NANCY CHURNIN Follow nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 11 September 2014 0350 PM Updated 11 September 2014 0350 PM Dolphin Tale 2 is a slow-moving anomaly delivered when most kids films tumble over one another to see which can deliver the thrills faster and funnier.Like Mavis a sea turtle with a sweet bit part in this sequel to 2011s Dolphin Tale the new film takes its time but delivers heartfelt goods in a fictionalized adaptation of another true story about Winter an injured dolphin who learns to swim with the help of a prosthetic fin.Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) the confused and angry young boy who found his direction through caring for Winter in the first tale is now a thoughtful teen who has taken on a leadership position at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Florida where Winter lives.He wins a scholarship to study marine biology at sea. He hesitates because Winters elderly dolphin companion has died and without a new companion Winter will be transferred to a facility in Texas. Which -- sorry Texas -- sounds like the worst thing that could happen to her.Another dolphin Mandy is rescued. And heres where the film gets interesting. While Mandy seems an obvious solution aquarium director Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) resists despite pressure from his daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) to do whats best for Winter.The challenging point that writer and director Charles Martin Smith makes is if Mandy is nursed back to sufficient health to go back to the ocean that and not Winters welfare is the priority. Happily once Hazel learns to do right by Mandy a solution emerges for Winter.The youth of the actors in Dolphin Tale skewed the audience younger than Dolphin Tale 2 which swims into chaste adolescent territory. Still the film should appeal both to animal lovers and those who appreciate the way Winter honors and inspires people with physical challenges.In one moving sequence Bethany Hamilton the one-armed surfer whose book Soul Surfer became a 2011 film swims with Winter. Its a scene that doesnt move the plot. Still Hamiltons story of prevailing is what the Dolphin Tale movies are really about.Stay in your seat after the film to catch poignant real-life scenes that inspired the fictional ones.DOLPHIN TALE 2 (B)Directed by Charles Martin Smith.

Grade B+ Throughout the engrossing sequel ""Dolphin Tale 2"" the personnel at the marine animal rescue center in Clearwater Fla. (Clearwater Marine Aquarium or CMA) ask their youthful colleague Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) how Winter the tail-less dolphin looks to him on any given day. What makes this fact-inspired film so stirring is that its writer-director Charles Martin Smith is equally concerned with how Winter is looking - at them. Smith the actor-turned-moviemaker who starred in the incandescent nature classic ""Never Cry Wolf"" for Carroll Ballard 21 years ago uses staged footage featuring the real Winter and animatronic puppets as well as digital effects to show key action unfolding from a dolphins perspective. The movie brings an audience so close to its animal heroines reactions that it achieves a rousing blend of clarity and mystery. When Winter homes in on a stretcher that workers use to transport dolphins to and from the ocean or to remove a dead companion from the dolphins pool the image is pregnant with emotion even if youre not exactly sure what shes ""thinking"" or ""feeling."" Without presuming to read a dolphins complex capacious brain viewers can share the instinctive kinship to Winter that teenage Sawyer feels after working with her for several years. (He was only 11 in the original.) If you desire or fear a replay of the first film be prepared ""Dolphin Tale 2"" is a different more pungent kettle of fish. Thats not to denigrate ""Dolphin Tale"" (2011) an ideal kids movie featuring swift heartfelt depictions of immediate existential threats. In that film after getting entangled in the rope of a crab cage Winter washes up on shore loses her tail learns to swim without it in a sideways motion then adjusts to a prosthetic tail designed to prevent her from injuring her spine - in time for a fundraising event to rehabilitate the hurricane-battered CMA. ""Dolphin Tale 2"" is more like a young adult novel - in fact its the most enjoyable YA live-action film Ive seen this entire YA-crazy year. Its problems are more involved and mature both for Winter and adolescent Sawyer. Winters companion dolphin Panama dies of old age leaving Winter bereft and disoriented. Panamas possible replacement Mandy is rehabilitated so successfully that she has to be released. (""Rescue Rehabilitation and Release"" is the CMAs motto.) Because its illegal to keep a female dolphin without the company of another female dolphin Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) and his team including his precocious daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) steel themselves to say goodbye. So does Sawyer whos honored but conflicted to be the one high school student selected for a Boston University ""SEA semester"" not wanting to be a fair-weather friend. Then out of the blue and the deep blue sea CMA gets called to rescue a baby female dolphin. She is orphaned before she learns whats needed to survive so this dolphin pup dubbed Hope can never be released. One crucial question remains Will Hope and Winter bond or turn against each other? Sure the movie wears its heart on its wetsuit but Smith elicits personable relaxed performances from his entire cast including Ashley Judd as Sawyers mom Morgan Freeman as Winters prosthetics whiz and Kris Kristofferson as Hazels sea salt of a granddad. Smiths script doesnt downplay the growing pains of individuals and institutions like CMA. Hazel must convince her dad that he should respect her and Sawyer as much as he does his adult colleagues. Clay must preserve CMAs ""three R"" principles - including the ""release"" part - despite financial pressures. Understandably the dialogue sometimes resembles homilies. Only Freeman could sell a whopper comparing an antique watch left too long in its box to Sawyers resistance toward leaving CMA for three months. But as a director and an all-around storyteller Smith lets his strongest themes billow out as steadily as trade winds. He doesnt overemphasize the optimism Winter inspires in veterans children and others whove lost limbs. It feels natural in ""Dolphin Tale 2"" for ""Soul Surfer"" Bethany Hamilton who lost an arm to a shark to be a special guest of CMA. A freeloading pelican named Rufus becomes once again both an irresistible cutup and a comic symbol of untamed nature. His intrusions upset some fans expecting CMA to be a theme park not a wild kingdom but he alerts workers to a sea turtle caught in fishing line and becomes its squawking guardian angel. Smith has an eye for knockabout farce and for untrammeled beauty and his camera is always in the right place to capture the ecstatic sight of dolphins in motion. Why is synchronized swimming so gorgeous in these mammals? The movie allows audiences to wonder at the magic act of Winter using the push of her snout on Hazels toes to send the girl spinning like clock hands through the water as if she and Winter were dance partners. Smith is no poet but his pursuit of authenticity pays off big time. The closing credits showcase documentary footage of the actual incidents re-created for ""Dolphin Tale 2."" When I saw the film awestruck kids and adults stayed in their seats until the copyright credit line rolled. Early on Smith told his cinematographer Daryn Okada that he wanted to shoot the film so ""the audience believes it really happened."" Their fusion of movie magic and reality emits an energizing warmth.

Marine Aquarium. (Bob Talbot/AP) Cozi Zuehlsdorff with Harry Connick Jr. in Dolphin Tale 2 (Wilson Webb/AP) Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff in Dolphin Tale 2 (Wilson Webb) BY Graham Fuller NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 11 2014 145 PM Title Dolphin Tale 2 Film Info With Harry Connick Jr. Morgan Freeman. Maturing teens further a dolphins recovery at an aquarium. Director Charles Martin Smith. (147). PG. Area theaters. No one over age 10 will flip for this sequel to the 2011 hit ""Dolphin Tale."" But that doesnt mean only kids will enjoy this gentle moving family drama. The story centers around the continued real-life rehab of the maimed bottlenose dolphin named Winter at a Tampa Bay aquarium. Writer-director Charles Martin Smith has reassembled the first movies cast for this efficiently crafted handsomely photographed sequel. Its not a franchise that plumbs the depths of characterization. The most troubled participant is Winter (""playing"" herself again) who succumbs to grief following the natural death of her surrogate mother Panama. (Though Rufus the Pelican who sets his cap at a sea turtle could use a shrink.) The tail-less Winters depression derails her recovery and she becomes unwilling to accept a prosthetic tail. She even throws a snit physically hurting her adolescent handler Sawyer (Nathan Gamble). Hes so concerned about her that he may give up spending a semester with a marine life program in the Caribbean. Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) is the aquarium-hospitals conscientious boss. Hes tasked with finding Winter a mandatory poolmate before a fussy U.S. agriculture inspector removes her to another facility. The movie takes potshots at bureaucratic officiousness . Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) Clays daughter and the aquariums spunky show announcer shares her dads and Sawyers worries. She also frets because Sawyer doesnt look in her direction often enough. Romantic tension eventually bubbles up between the kids. Gamble and Zuehlsdorff are likable. Neither their looks nor their acting is airbrushed. Like Connick they know the value of restraint. Morgan Freeman as the prosthetics doctor Ashley Judd as Sawyers mom and Kris Kristofferson as Clays dad merely get to twinkle and douse the younguns in wisdom. Shark victim and champion surfer Bethany Hamilton has a cameo . Footage of disabled children visiting Floridas actual Clearwater Marine Aquarium plays over the credits. Thats a warm way to end a movie about healing and inclusion.

Youll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sandie Angulo Chen September 11 2014 Americas favorite dolphin returns to the screen in ""Dolphin Tale 2"" a sequel as eager to charm audiences as the 2011 original. Again ""inspired by true events"" ""Dolphin Tale 2"" provides family-friendly animal fare that should engage tweens and young middle-schoolers who dream of rescuing and swimming with dolphins but wont scare their little siblings in the audience. This sequel again helmed by writer- director Charles Martin Smith takes place three years after the end of the original ""Dolphin Tale"" in which Winter and her prosthetic tail saved Dr. Clay Hasketts (Harry Connick Jr.) aquarium from closing. Winters popularity has turned the Clearwater Marine Aquarium into a state-of-the-art rehabilitation center for marine animals. The aquarium has also become a popular Tampa Bay tourist destination where Winter inspires wounded veterans children with disabilities and even such celebrities as ""Soul Surfer"" Bethany Hamilton who makes a special visit to the CMA to swim with a fellow amputee. Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) now 14 also has become famous for his rescue of and work with Winter. Early in the story Sawyer receives a scholarship to join graduate students on a prestigious semester at sea program. But doing so would force him to leave Winter and the aquarium for three months. A death in the family of sorts complicates Sawyers decision Winters companion dolphin Panama dies of old age leaving Winter alone and CMA in violation of animal welfare laws that require aquariums to keep dolphins in pairs. Thus emerge the movies slim but intertwined plotlines Will the aquarium rescue another dolphin that can be kept in captivity with Winter and will Sawyer decide to spend a semester at sea or stay in his comfort zone at CMA? The answers might seem predictable but surprisingly the dilemmas provide real -- if sentimental -- moments of tension and drama leading up to the movies satisfying conclusion. Gamble gamely plays Sawyer the earnest budding marine biologist as he navigates the tricky waters of adolescent brooding and indecision. The movie even includes a subtle little romance as Sawyer deals with female attention from pretty aquarium volunteers and his precocious best friend Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) Clays daughter and the aquariums resident documentarian. The gentle pacing of the film is too laid-back at times particularly in a few overlong underwater swimming scenes that start out lovely but conclude as apparent filler material. But thats a small quibble with a movie thats this sweet and cheesy. If you dont say ""awww"" when the crew rescues a baby dolphin (and subsequently names her Hope of course) youre definitely not the target audience for this movie (and maybe not human). And if you think the director made up some of the sappier sequences make sure to stick around for the credits where documentary footage shows he did base those adorable rescues releases and swims on real life including poignant moments of amputee veterans and kids visiting and swimming with Winter. Chen is a freelance writer.   1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains some mild thematic elements. 107 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are brought back for ""Dolphin Tale 2"" but they dont have a lot to do. Photo Wilson Webb Associated Press Movie review Dolphin Tale 2 is sweet but story is lacking 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Dolphin Tale 2 Comedy/drama. Starring Harry Connick Jr. Ashley Judd Nathan Gamble and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Charles Martin Smith. (PG. 107 minutes.) Maybe its my imagination but Winter the dolphin seems to be pulling a bit of a Shia LaBeouf in ""Dolphin Tale 2."" Sure the cetacean star goes through the contractually obligated motions in this popular entertainment sequel. But you get the feeling that Winter is just biding time until a more edgy Lars von Trier film debut. Its a strain to poke fun at ""Dolphin Tale 2."" Even more than the very solid first film this is cynicism-free cinema; a place where snark goes to die. But while the wholesomeness PG-rating positivity and conservation goals remain a strong selling point the story simply isnt as good as the first one. Directed by ""Never Cry Wolf"" star Charles Martin Smith ""Dolphin Tale"" was a welcome throwback a solid piece of filmmaking and a completely innocent tween-friendly story. It strayed a bit from the source material but that was balanced by a co-starring role for the real-life dolphin Winter who was saved in the mid-2000s after she was fitted with a prosthetic tail. This time the drama at Clearwater Marine Aquarium centers on Winters depression and the race-against-the-clock search for a new companion. A less interesting second story features Winters human friend Sawyer who struggles to decide whether to attend a semester at sea. Both narratives seem forced especially following the happily-ever-after ending in the first film. The filmmakers strain to ratchet up the drama with confusingly vague threats to move Winter and fire aquarium head Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.). Based on the pains Sawyer goes through deciding whether to get on a boat youd think hes taking a one-way trip into outer space to plant a nuclear missile on an asteroid. Thankfully the tone remains the same. Smith who also wrote the script inserts a lesson at every turn. Best of all he never talks down to the young audience. Haskett must decide whether to release a perfectly healthy dolphin even though the animals continued presence could save Winter. Its a complex moral dilemma that kids and parents can discuss on the ride home from the theater. The actors who play Sawyer and Hasketts daughter Hazel (Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff) have a nice chemistry both with each other and the adults in their life. With close to zero romance in this film - affairs hinted at in the first ""Dolphin Tale"" have been abandoned - more complex kid/adult relationships can be explored. The father and daughter conflict between Clay and Hazel Haskett is particularly satisfying aided by two actors who clearly are buying into this material. Other characters from the last film are clumsily forced into the plot. Its kind of sad to see Rufus the Pelican getting way more screen time and plot significance than characters played by Kris Kristofferson and Ashley Judd. Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman strolls in for barely two minutes and still commands the moment. ""Dolphin Tale 2"" picks up when an injured young dolphin shows up playing Cousin Oliver to Winters Bobby Brady. Note to Hollywood filmmakers When your third act is falling apart a juvenile dolphin is a pretty good fix-all. A baby dolphin probably could have saved ""Godfather III.""

It was Flipper who opined There are no second acts in dolphin life. Youre born you swim you spawn you die.Yet in the original ""Dolphin Tale"" a sea creature called Winter got a temporary reprieve from placement on Gods trophy wall. In that true story a Florida boy named Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) rescued the female dolphin from a crab trap but she lost her tail fin in the incident. Nathan enlisted the help of a small family-run marine hospital in Clearwater which turned to scientist Cameron McCarthy (Morgan Freeman) to build Winter a prosthetic tail.Sooner than you could say holy mackerel Winter was swimming again the aquarium staved off some greedy developers and its owner (Harry Connick Jr.) was making guppy eyes at Sawyers single mom (Ashley Judd). Happy ending right? Yet in an amazing post-script even before the movie made a whale of a lot of money the key ingredient for a sequel presented itself on the last day of shooting. Thats when the real-life Clearwater hospital rescued a motherless young dolphin they dubbed Hope. Now the filmmakers have shoehorned Hope into ""Dolphin Tale 2"" a family flick that punches the right buttons like a trained seal.Now in his senior year of high school Sawyer is the chief tour guide at the hospital-cum-aquarium which has been packed with visitors since Winter became a media sensation. To heal the many needy creatures Sawyer works closely with Hazel Haskett (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) the teen daughter of the facilitys owner. But just as the movie is coy about the relationship between Dr. Haskett and Sawyers mom we never get the expected spark in the narrative vacuum between Hazel and Sawyer. This movie is as squeaky clean as a new beach ball and the few waves in the water are all-too-easily navigated. As soon as Winters pool companion Panama dies of old age and the federal inspector (director Charles Martin Smith) warns that a dolphin cant live solo Hope arrives. And when Winter cant keep up with her frisky new playmate Dr. McCarthy arrives with a new and improved prosthetic tail. Add a barking pelican for comic relief and ""Dolphin Tale 2"" is a coo-inducing movie that runs on autopilot without veering into the realm of bad taste. The films apparent sensitivity to the hot topic of marine-animal rights means that if Winter were ever released she wouldnt be inclined to write a memoir called ""12 Years A Sideshow Attraction.""What ""Dolphin Tale 2""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 147  Content Some mild thematic elements Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Life lessons are learned children do some growing up nothing too terribly upsetting happens and the corniness is mostly kept to tolerable levels.AZCENTRAL10 feel-good animal moviesAs an engaging piece of dramatic entertainment though the film could use a prosthetic of its own to help guide it through rough waters.Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) is a headstrong teenager now working with friend Hazel Haskett (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) under the tutelage of Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium an institution that rescues rehabs and when possible releases animals back into the wild.RELATED azcentral.coms newest movie reviews | 52 Fall films to see in 2014Winter has been thriving under their care -- that is until her female companion dolphin dies of old age. Alone in her tank Winter regresses refusing her prosthetic and sulking underneath a platform. Without a replacement companion with whom she gets along Winter -- the aquariums breadwinner -- will be relocated to Texas.Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman in a scene from ""Dolphin Tale 2."" (Photo Warner Bros.)The conflict is strained even by family-friendly-sequel standards but the movie tries hard to wring drama out of it like so much blood from a stone. Theres another female dolphin in the aquarium who might make a suitable companion but Dr. Haskett hems and haws over the possibility for far too long without explaining his reservations.The kid actors acquit themselves nicely -- the film knowing its audience gives them more to do -- but the adults are often left floundering like fish out of water. Ashley Judd perma-smiles her way through parenting Sawyer in his moments of need while Kris Kristofferson and Morgan Freeman are reduced to kindly old men who grouse wisdom when its narratively convenient.""Dolphin Tale 2"" really hits its stride when it functions like an immersive visit to an aquarium. Dolphins sea turtles pelicans -- they all look fantastic on the big screen and the underwater photography is occasionally breathtaking. Bethany Hamilton the professional surfer who lost an arm in a shark attack is no professional actress but the shots of her swimming with Winter are incredible the dance of transformed bodies mesmerizing.Its worth wading through some sugary-sweet human drama and the occasional wooden line delivery for that intimate look at nature.

Pictures Copyright Alcon Entertainment LLC Wilson Webb) 69 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORELike its predecessor Dolphin Tale 2 is a family-friendly story with a heart-warming and wise message of healing ( out of four; rated PG; opening Friday nationwide).Informative morally complex and supremely well-intentioned it generally sidesteps sentimentality for appealingly straightforward storytelling.The original cast returns as does its titular star Winter the dolphin. While the adult performances far outshine those of the younger cast members its the dolphins who are the featured players. Close-ups of their evocative eyes irresistibly draw viewers in.USA TODAYThe Drop A mordant underworld thrillerThe story takes up roughly where the 2011 original left off. Everything centers on life at the Clearwater (Fla.) Marine Aquarium and the staffs efforts to rehabilitate wounded sea creatures. The human focus is on teenage volunteer Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) and the team who work under biologist Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.).In the original Haskett and his dedicated staff at the aquarium rescued a maimed dolphin they named Winter. Having gotten tangled in a crab trap Winters tail fin was so irrevocably damaged that it had to be amputated. She was fitted with a prosthetic tail fashioned by Dr. Cameron McCarthy (Morgan Freeman) who specialized in creating artificial limbs. She was also showered with love and attention by Sawyer -- who initially found Winter -- and the bubbly Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) Dr. Hasketts daughter. In this film Winter gets a new and improved tail with McCarthy using more flexible materials. She continues to be a symbol of perseverance. In a climactic though overly long scene she is introduced to a new young dolphin named Hope. Meanwhile Sawyers friendship with Hazel continues to grow with the hint of romantic jealousy on Hazels part as Sawyer connects briefly with another young volunteer. These scenes feel shoehorned in perhaps setting up a romantic triangle for the third installment. We get that the kids are growing up but that plot turn seems extraneous.Because of his dedication to Winter and the aquarium Sawyer who had struggled in middle school is offered a special spot on a seagoing educational voyage. His proud single mother played by Ashley Judd encourages him to go but Sawyer hesitates worrying about leaving Winter at a critical time. USA TODAYWhere do these lonely people belong? In a better movieAfter fellow dolphin Panama dies of old age Winter becomes despondent. Its as if she needs time to process her grief over the death of her companion.Some complex dilemmas are raised with subtlety and intelligence. Undeniably social animals dolphins in captivity must be paired according to federal regulations. To keep one alone is considered cruel. If no other wounded dolphin is brought in Winter will have to be sent off to live in more social surroundings. Those who fund the aquarium seem determined to keep dolphins around for visitors urging Haskett to find a partner for Winter. But this is no aquatic amusement park. The principled Haskett is wedded to his ethos of rescue rehabilitate and release. A possible partner surfaces in the form of Mandy a recently rescued dolphin who was found beached and badly sunburned. She is soon restored to health however and Haskett is adamant that it would be cruel to confine the recovered creature. The doctors father Reed Haskett (Kris Kristofferson) is around for grizzled guidance. One of the most inspiring aspects of the film is the way it approaches disabilities and missing or prosthetic limbs. A war veteran with an artificial leg and several small children with prostheses are woven into scenes naturally. The films message of acceptance is laudable as is its emphasis on resilience and healing. Too few films normalize disability in such a compassionate way.""Dolphin Tale 2""  the sequel to the original story about wounded sea creatures at a Florida aquarium is a family-friendly story with a heart-warming and wise message of healing.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Dolphin Tale 2 is kind of infuriating mostly because it tries to so hard to be innocuous. Kids like animals whats wrong with that? Nothing. A dolphin beat the odds and now inspires veterans and disabled children with her story of hope? Thats great. And when that same very special dolphin loses her best friend and finds a new one? Well only a monster would have a problem with that.It seems like a defensive strategy on the part of the filmmakers when really they could have just given viewers more of the raison detre for a movie like this animal scenes. No child--and certainly no adult presumably in the company of a child--goes to see Dolphin Tale 2 for any reason other than to watch dolphins swimming around. When they do appear the animal scenes in Dolphin Tale 2 are well done with some nice-looking if standard underwater cinematography. The animal cast itself is quite endearing; on top of star attraction Winter and comic relief Rufus The Pelican we meet Mandy The Dolphin Hope The Dolphin and Mavis an animatronic turtle.The central conflict of Dolphin Tale 2 is based around young Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) our hero from the first film now a 15-year-old wunderkind who leads staff meetings and an army of teen volunteers who call him ""sir"" for some reason. Sawyer has received an offer to participate in a prestigious Semester At Sea program but being young hes reluctant to leave home. Then one of the dolphins at the aquarium Panama dies of old age and Sawyers beloved Winter falls into what appears to be a deep depression. Facing a loss of business as well as USDA fines Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) is pressured to pair up newly acquired dolphin Mandy with the despondent Winter. But this is in conflict with Hasketts trap-rehabilitate-release philosophy and he defies his boss the government and his own daughters wishes to set young Mandy free. A nice little lesson in scientific ethics right?Sure except another young dolphin one who conveniently can never be re-released into the wild for reasons that are barely skimmed over in the movie is found immediately afterwards rendering Hasketts big sacrifice superfluous. Thats whats so frustrating about Dolphin Tale 2--the plot is being driven by forces that are beyond the characters control. Hasketts bound by scientific ethics. The USDA is bound by law. Sawyer cant commit to three lousy months abroad because he has to wait and see what happens to Winter. And because everyones basically throwing their hands up in the air saying ""What do you want me to do?"" the conflict such as it is feels more like waiting around for the deux ex machina that we know has to appear at some point or the movie will never end.The plotting of Dolphin Tale 2 is best symbolized in the scene where Dr. Cameron McCarthy (Morgan Freeman at his most grandfatherly) gives Sawyer a pocket watch as a going-away present. The watch is stopped. Sawyer is disappointed. He shakes it and it starts again. Problem solved. Thats what this movie does when it needs to move the story along--just shake the watch and hope things start ticking again. But at least they brought back the pelican.

Rated PG (mild maritime peril). At the Kips Bay the 84th Street the 34th Street others. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water for ""Dolphin Tale 2"" it actually was safe to go back to the water and everyone was nice to each other and the porpoises were cute. The end. Oh should I have said ""spoiler alert""? Spoiler alert. Even for a movie about complying with USDA regulations ""Dolphin Tale 2"" is a little lacking in excitement. This time Winter the beast from the first film who lost her tail in an accident and was fitted with a prosthetic whipped up by a local genius (Morgan Freeman) is lonely because her companion at a Florida aquarium dies. A second dolphin Mandy has been brought in after turning up on a nearby beach but Mandy recovers and is released to the sea and Winter is about to be solo again. USDA regulations forbid that so Winter may be shipped off to ""a marine park in Texas."" That sounds about as much fun as a dungeon in Burma. Fretting excessively about this is Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) a teen associate at the aquarium who has just been offered a chance to spend a free summer at sea training in marine biology. Instead he says hes thinking about staying citing uncertainty about Winters fate. Dolphins live to their 40s were told -- so is he going to spend his whole life hanging around Winter? Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff seen with dolphin Winter in ""Dolphin Tale 2.""Photo Wilson Webb/Warner Bros Pictures Talk about a mammals boy. Maybe he should pay a little more attention to the pretty young colleague Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) who is always hanging around him. Unhappily for her hes a cold fish. As the movie marches stolidly toward a nice safe ending all the wholesome but dull ""Dolphin Tale"" has to recommend it is its ironclad niceness and some lovely underwater photography. At poolside the films alleged stars Harry Connick Jr. (as the owner of the aquarium and Hazels dad) Kris Kristofferson (as his father) and Ashley Judd (as Sawyers mom) have little to do except wait for another rescue dolphin and for the lad to make his decision. A dolphin they find trapped on a beach -- they name her Hope -- is rushed to the aquarium. And writer-director Charles Martin Smith tires his best to freight such scenes with suspense but it just doesnt look that harrowing to load an unresisting dolphin on a stretcher truck it to an aquarium and dump it in a tank. About the time a sea turtle is getting put into an MRI machine instead of a soup tureen you start to think that maybe this movie is a bit mixed up when it comes to the relative importance of species. A closing montage in which children of all ages who have lost limbs and are wearing prostheses come to the aquarium to view the tail-less Winter confirms the impression Arent these kids (and a couple of vets we meet who have left legs on the battlefield) a lot more important than a depressed dolphin?

Gabriela Cowperthwaites 2013 expose of Sea Worlds inhumane conditions for killer whales and occupational perils for trainers has kept animal cruelty in the headlines if only because the marine amusement parks stock has nosedived since the films premiere. Though writer-director Charles Martin Smiths script for ""Dolphin Tale 2"" was probably completed before the release of ""Blackfish"" its impossible not to see this sequel to the 2011 schmaltz-fest as belonging to the post-""Blackfish"" era. The original ""Dolphin Tale"" hinged on a near-mystical connection between wayward teen Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) and Winter the dolphin he helps restore to health after her infected tail eventually requires amputation. Winter is no mere patient but a friend teacher and guidance counselor to Sawyer in one smooth rubbery package. See video Harry Connick Jr. Helps Dolphin Winter Find a Little Hope in Dolphin Tale 2 Trailer (Video) In the relatively grown-up ""Dolphin Tale 2"" however Winter and her fellow injured dolphins are ""wild animals"" -- a phrase repeated no less than three times to emphasize that rescued dolphins arent pets or even domesticated companions but unpredictable creatures we cant wholly understand. In an early scene an upset Winter unwilling to perform for the crowds even swats at Sawyer resulting in an arm injury. The sequel then clearly expects viewers of the first film to grow up with the franchise. A preoccupation with growth and its attending pains permeates and coheres the film. Having surpassed the slick sentimentality of the original ""Dolphin Tale 2"" is a unexpectedly satisfying and conscientious coming-of-age narrative about how maturity sometimes means letting go of immediate emotional attachments for a greater cause or a longer view of things. Also read Blackfish Effect SeaWorld Building Huge Tanks for Whales After Criticism Financial Slide And yet it remains an appealing fantasy about super-teens saving sick animals. Aquarium director Dr. Clay (Harry Connick Jr.) is officially in charge but hes happy to hand off many of his responsibilities to his daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) and his protege Sawyer. The eventful film contains several storylines but the major plots concern Sawyers dilly-dallying about participating in a three-month semester at sea and the far more compelling fate of Winter who might have to be moved to a different facility when her dolphin-mate a legally required companion suddenly dies. Also read Harry Connick Jr. Confirms Return to American Idol To adult eyes the distribution of labor to a couple of adolescents with seemingly very little book learning feels somewhat silly especially when a dismayed Hazel pores over the medical charts of a dolphin that her father would prefer to release back into the wild rather than pair with Winter thus insuring the latters stay at the aquarium. For younger viewers though the youths incongruous authority at the educational institution might well prove inspiring. (For the record the dolphin rescuers seen in documentary footage during the credits have many many years on the film characters.) The longer ""Dolphin Tale 2"" stays out of the water the more desperately it gasps for air. The arc about Sawyers indecision regarding the semester at sea -- and another subplot about Hazels unrequited crush on him -- feel like cheap processed filler. (At least the kid actors apparently got some thesping lessons between the first and second movies.) See also Morgan Freeman Says Not to Make Race a Bigger Issue Than It Needs to Be (Video) Once underwater though Smith mines urgent drama -- and joyous spectacles -- from the characters Hippocratic desire to do right by the dolphins under their care. Two scenes of utter elation conclude the storylines of the main dolphins by reuniting them with other members of their own species. Its telling that the human role in these scenes is to applaud and not much more. Contributing to the cheers are Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman as Sawyers mother and Winters prostheticist respectively; their biggest role in the film appears to be lending their recognizable names to the poster. Rather than rely on a contrived relationship between humans and animals (ahem Lassie) then Smiths scrupulous sequel somehow makes the respectful distance between humans and animals the stuff of poignant dilemmas while still fulfilling the desire of watching a boy swim and dive and jump in the water with his favorite dolphin to an adoring crowd. You could accuse ""Dolphin Tale 2"" of trying to have its kelp and eat it too. But the whole thing just works; the film gets pretty close to the Platonic ideal of accessible but still meaningful edutainment. And in a movie landscape thats aggressively dumbed down and cynical a little integrity goes a long way. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

""Science doesnt know if dolphins feel emotions the same way we do"" intones adolescent narrator Sawyer Nelson at the outset. So its possible that they will not view this sequel to 2011s surprise hit about a dolphin who gets a prosthetic tail with boredom frustration at the dolphin ex machina or annoyance at its willingness to rely almost entirely on the good will built by the original.

Bringing together the original cast headed by Harry Connick Jr. and of course Winter the remarkable dolphin outfitted with a groundbreaking prosthetic tail who put the CMA on the map the sequel again eschews cloying dramatics in favor of a straight-ahead docudrama feel. The nonetheless rousing results should make a splash with family audiences who were responsible for Dolphin Tales tidy 72.3 million domestic haul. This time around Smith also dons a screenwriters cap in recounting the subsequent rescue and rehabilitation of injured marine animals brought to the actual Gulf Coast of Florida facility. It has been several years since the films young Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) first bonded with the dolphin who had lost her tail after becoming ensnared in a crab trap but the death of Panama an elderly dolphin who was both companion and surrogate mother to Winter has left the younger dolphin despondent and uncooperative. The clock is ticking for CMAs Dr. Clay Haskett (Connick Jr.) to abide by USDA regulations and find a female companion suitable for pairing with Winter or see the inspirational creature moved to another aquatic facility. Their best bet would seem to be Mandy a recent rescue who had been found beached and severely sunburned but keeping her at the aquarium with Winter would mean not letting her go back to her natural habitat. That would go against Hasketts rescue-rehabilitate-release ethos. Hope ultimately arrives in the form of a dolphin calf stray (discovered in real life on the night of the first films wrap party) but theres no guarantee the infant will bond with the tailless Winter. Even more so than in the original Smith focuses a great deal of attention on the details -- the day-to-day minutiae of the facilitys rescue and rehab work that elevate what could have otherwise been another well-intentioned but soggy fish-out-of-water yarn. Those specifics are efficiently navigated by Connick Jr. who blends a convincing authority with tenderness as does the rest of the returning cast including Cozi Zuehlsdorff as Hasketts concerned daughter Hazel and in reduced roles Kris Kristofferson as her grandfather Ashley Judd as Sawyers mom and Morgan Freeman as prosthetics whiz Dr. Cameron McCarthy. Echoing that unadorned matter-of-fact approach is the crisp cinematography and graceful score by Dolphin Tale newcomers Daryn Okada and Rachel Portman respectively.

Blissfully swimming against the hyperactive kidpic tide ""Dolphin Tale 2"" gently peddles inspirational life lessons while respecting both its characters and its audience. Arriving three years after its surprise hit predecessor this sequel about the unbreakable bonds between a boy and his dolphin remains too square and earnest to appeal beyond families and animal lovers. Nevertheless writer-director Charles Martin Smith hits the sweet spot for that target audience once again and in the process delivers a more streamlined storyline and ever so slightly darker shadings to further justify the follow-up. Duplicating the originals 72 million domestic B.O. could be a challenge -- especially given the commendable decision to ditch the first films unnecessary 3D release -- but solid returns look like a walk in the aquatic park. All the key ""Dolphin Tale"" players return here beginning with plucky protagonist Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) -- now an increasingly self-assured young teenager -- and his marine mammal pal Winter (playing herself with occasional assists from animatronics and visual effects). Both on- and offscreen Winter managed to survive and thrive after the amputation of her tail with the assistance of a custom-designed prosthetic becoming a star attraction at Floridas Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Thats where Sawyer spends his summers working alongside noble role model Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) and his daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) who shares Sawyers passion for sea life and begins to develop more than just a platonic affection for the boy shes grown up with. (The delicate progression of their unrequited romance dodges genre conventions for something a little less predictable which cant exactly be said of the pic overall.) With Sawyer and Winter both facing sudden turning points -- Sawyer in the form of an offer to spend a semester at sea in a prestigious study program and Winter in the wake of the death of elderly aquarium poolmate Panama -- the drama pivots on two questions. Can Clearwater locate a USDA mandated companion for Winter? And can Sawyer comfortably leave her behind to pursue his own dreams? Any mild suspense is squashed with the late arrival of a baby dolphin named (what else?) Hope -- a fortuitous plot twist also inspired by real life events. Much of ""Dolphin Tale 2"" is as on-the-nose as Hopes name but parents arent likely to object to a film that provides squeaky clean entertainment without sending gag reflexes into overdrive. Even in the movies most egregious flights of fancy -- young Sawyer lecturing a room full of adult professionals on the best methods to introduce Hope to Winter; a comic-relief subplot detailing a pelicans nearly stalkerish obsession with a sea turtle -- the innate warmth of the characters provides enough of a ballast for all but the most extreme cynics. Indeed an unforced sense of decency emerges as the most noteworthy element here especially with Smiths script paying special attention to the last part of the aquariums ""Rescue Rehabilitate Release"" mantra. If an animal is healthy enough to return to its natural habitat without threatening its safety thats what will happen -- a strict tenant for Haskett that causes some friction with Sawyer and Hazel when it compromises their ability to hold on to Winter after Panamas passing. Pics sturdy emphasis on compassion as a virtue extends to the limited screen time for overqualified supporting players Ashley Judd as Sawyers mom and Morgan Freeman as Winters prosthetic designer. Theyre both primarily on hand to capably deliver words of wisdom without descending into preachiness. Those strengths compensate for a proficient but largely undistinguished tech package -- although the visual effects employed to blend shots of real and artificial dolphins often within the same scene are a little more seamless now than they were three years ago. Rachel Portmans soaring score is an even more marked improvement over the first ""Tale"" but the standout tech element remains the same sparingly used underwater cinematography by Pete Zuccarini. This time he works in tandem with documentarian Bob Talbot unencumbered by the need for oversized 3D cameras and captures a strikingly beautiful submarine ballet featuring pro surfer Bethany Hamilton (playing herself in a fleeting cameo) swimming with Winter to rep the humble pics aesthetic high point.

All Rights Reserved. Even the most inspiration-averse will have eyes as moist as blowholes by the end credits of Dolphin Tale 2 a good-hearted kids drama whose earnestness and surprising moral complexity put other sunny-weepy sea-mammal flicks to shame. After the story wraps up the filmmakers work a trick thats become common in movies purporting to have something to do with real events Heres video footage of the real-world inspiration for the onscreen heroes in this case the actual dolphin Winter whose rescue and rehabilitation were recounted in the first Dolphin Tale. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - To appreciate these scenes you have to know Winters story which is a beaut. Winter got tangled up in a crab trap almost drowned and damaged her tail so badly that the marine doctors who treated her had no choice but to amputate it. In the movie version Winter benefits from the love and perseverance of bright-eyed moppets Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) and Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) who hit upon the idea of enlisting a doctor at the VA hospital to whip up a dolphin prosthetic. The doc (Morgan Freeman) outfits Winter the kids keep believing and that not-a-fish trouper grits it through rehab and soon is back to making like Flipper. The end credits of Dolphin Tale 2 then highlight that VA connection Witness real amputees vets and kids beaming at Winter who it is more moving to regard in this incidental footage than in the main movies fictionalized scenes. Writer-director Charles Martin Smith knows better than to anthropomorphize his animal cast too much but between close-ups and CGI and inspirational music the movie is often showing us what the filmmakers want Winter to look like. Heres Winter just being which is a different animal altogether Shes sleek and unknowable with eyes like black gemstones. Whats behind them? Does she know that she thrives in collaboration with us? Does she feel that shes worked her way back? Does she comprehend that her story stirs such feeling in the land-apes around her -- even kinship? Does it bug her that because she cannot face the hardships of ocean life shell spend the rest of her days in captivity? Film Details Dolphin Tale 2 RatingPG GenreDrama Running Time107 min. More Info Trailer The movies wise rather than wised-up. Winter plays herself with the aid of computers and animatronics and probably buckets of fish. Like Burt Reynolds in Smokey and the Bandit II shes tasked with doing lots of the same things she did in the first movie -- wearing the tail cavorting with the kids -- while also spending a lot of the sequel too depressed to get back into the game. This time Winters slumped glumly in her pool at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium refusing to swim even swiping at Sawyer the boy who loves her. Thats sad but its taken from Winters real life which offers another question to contemplate How many concepts would you have to explain to a dolphin to get her to understand shes acting the story of a funk she actually suffered?Winters malaise settles in once a dolphin pal of hers dies. (Smith handles the upsetting scenes with matter-of-fact tastefulness Theres no missing the carcass on the bottom of the pool but theres no dwelling on it either.) Since theyre profoundly social animals dolphins in captivity need to be paired. Since its cruel to keep a dolphin captive and there are few wounded dolphins around the aquarium staff faces tough choices that make for interesting drama.The film opens with the rescue of Mandy a sunburnt dolphin that has washed up on a beach. By the time Winter needs a friend Mandy is healthy enough for release back into the wild -- and young Hazel whose family runs the aquarium campaigns hard to pair up Mandy and Winter anyway. She loves Winter so much that shes willing to sacrifice Mandys freedom to save her.Her father -- played by Harry Connick Jr. -- reminds her that the mission of the aquariums staff is to rescue and release animals. His own father -- Kris Kristofferson -- agrees but stubborn Hazel fights on all as the feds threaten to take Winter away if she isnt paired up soon. Smith structures his story so that its Hazel herself who discovers that shes wrong -- that wild animals are not pets. (Both kids are strong naturalistic performers but Zuehlsdorff a ginger cut-up with smile enough for two gets all the best scenes.) Hazels pal Sawyer learns something of the same lesson still loving Winter even after Winter cold-cocks him one. Occasionally Winter and the kids glide about together in glorious swim-dance but the movies heart and energy are in the less fantastic but much more moving scenes of animal rescue -- and animal release. There is a miracle of sorts toward the end of the movie but its one that really happened -- and that we glimpse real footage of over the credits. Theres also a sassy pelican with a crush on a rehabbing sea turtle but anyone who has ever typed ""animal friendships"" into YouTube can swing with that. (Is it any odder a pairing than Connick and Kristofferson?) Theres no attempt though to paint the inner lives of animals as anything we can comprehend. The kids love Winter and Winter trusts the kids but Dolphin Tale 2 is a singularly honest animal film It never insists that Winter wouldnt prefer to be elsewhere . . . or that what she feels for them has anything to do with what we think of as love.
