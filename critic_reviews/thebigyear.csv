Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 14 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 13 2011 457PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English A featherweight comedy about competitive bird-watching or ""birding"" as its properly known The Big Year sees Steve Martin his generations pre-eminent Preening Booby crossing migration paths with slacker comedy kings Owen Wilson and Jack Black. Bird-poop jokes and falls from trees seem sure to follow. Surprisingly they dont. As directed by David Frankel ( The Devil Wears Prada Marley and Me) The Big Year loosely based on Mark Obmasciks non-fiction book The Big Year A Tale of Man Nature and Fowl Obsession is more interested in warm and fuzzy life lessons than exploiting the slapstick opportunities inherent in chasing small creatures through inhospitable terrains. The result is an offence-free mild entertainment in which everyone from cast to scriptwriter seems to be winging it. The films begins with its voice-over by Brad Harris (Jack Black) a divorced 36-year-old computer-code writer who lives with his parents (Brian Dennehy and Diane Wiest). Brad introduces a John Cleese-narrated animation clip offering a spurious history of the North American contest where bird fanatics compete to see who can spot the largest number of different species in one 12-month period in the continental United States and Canada. The commitment can involve thousands of dollars and constant travel with the successes quaintly documented on the honour system. Brad has decided his time has come to break the record of 737 birds to prove to himself and his critical father that hes not a loser. He next introduces his competitors Stu Preissler (Martin) is a rich CEO who longs to retire from the top of the financial worlds pecking order to pursue his real passion. He has the support of his globe-trotting wife (JoBeth Williams) but is undermined by his needy corporate colleagues who keep demanding one more essential meeting. Finally we are introduced to the birdman to beat Kenny Bostick (Wilson in a Fockers-like alpha-dude role) - a wealthy roofing contractor and self-styled ""Mozart"" of the birding world who ignores the pleas of his latest wife (Rosamund Pike) to stay home and help make a baby so he can get out on the road and defend his record. What follows is a series of frantic trips to various serene locations with beautiful British Columbia (shot with anamorphic lenses and occasional flair to suggest nature documentary) standing in for the rest of the continent. The principal story focuses on Brad and Stus on-again off-again intergenerational bromance. They meet and bond aboard a bird-spotting ferry then break up and later reunite in an effort to defeat the wily Bostick as the days of the year tick by. A side jaunt to the remote Aleutian island of Attu allows Brad to meet a potential romantic interest (Rashida Jones) so he can finally begin to get his own nest in order. Frequent bursts of the Trashmens Surfin Bird on his cellphone mark their initial long-distance relationship. Bird fanciers havent had much reason to put down their binoculars and watch movies since the early sixties when John Frankenheimers The Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) and Alfred Hitchcocks horror classic The Birds (1963) were released in back-to-back years. The Big Year which focuses on the hobbyists zaniness rather than the object of their interest doesnt fill the bill. The occasional inserted footage of a pink-footed goose or a CGI-generated hummingbird is unlikely to register as a significant event on any birders life list.

This story of three strangers (Martin Black and Wilson) competing in the titular contest to spot the most North American birds is a sitcom-y series of bumpy plane flights nauseating helicopter jaunts and seasick boat rides interspersed with the occasional pratfall from Black. There isnt a single laugh; Frankel fills that void with copious amounts of bathos as the three protagonists eventually find themselves in one squishy way or another compelled over the course of their 365-day odyssey to confront the preeminent value of friendship love and family. Failing even to attempt genuinely humorous gags or scenarios and incapable of conveying the thrill of its obsessive pastime or the majesty of the animals themselves this feel-good male weepie remains comedically and dramatically grounded.

Warmhearted even. PG comedy done right though there are far more smiles than laughs. Completely innocuous mostly harmless or even downright vanilla - no matter how you describe The Big Year you will end up back at the same place where qualitative measurement is concerned. The film is cute charming and passes the time in a pleasant enough manner. But thats it Thats as far as one can go unless one happens to be an avid birder. Its not groundbreaking comedy and at times it isnt a comedy it all. Thats fine for a matinee or rental though I wouldnt pay the extra surcharge for 3-D birds. Whats that? Its not available in 3-D? Fair enough. Steve Martin Jack Black and Owen Wilson are bird enthusiasts. Birders even. They are all on a quest to see the most species of bird in a year this informal competition is called a ""Big Year"" in the birding community. Theres some intrigue behind this ""Big Year"" pursuit. For one according to the film youre supposed to keep it pretty clandestine. Owen Wilsons character holds the record for species spotting (732 in the film) and hes back out on another quest attempting to break his own record. BUT AT WHAT COST??? Sorry attempted to inject massive tension into a pleasant dramedy my fault. But there is a toll to pay and its Wilsons (known as Kenny Bostick) marriage thats in trouble. Steve Martin is a massively successful entrepreneur who is nearing retirement and loves bird watching. Adores it even. Hes attempting to pivot out of the business world and into his own Big Year pursuit but his lawyerly co-workers keep trying to pull him back in. Hes a bit like Michael Corleone in that respect. The final lead is Jack Black as a down on his luck nuclear power plant operator named Brad Harris. This fellow has a special gift he can determine hundreds of species of birds by sound alone. Hes the plucky underdog without the financial resources of the corporate titan or the savvy veteran presence of the current record holder. As you can see each birder has their own cross to bear when it comes to the effect loving bird spotting has on their life well see the interplay between the three leads and each particular issue throughout the film. Now about that PG rating. There are two curse words sprinkled in but other than that the humor is mined from massively kind places. Phrases like ""crazier than a road lizard"" are liberally used. They also throw a mess of birding terms at you ""Code 5 bird"" is the only one I remember off the top of my head ... but that might be enough for you to start a nice conversation with at a cocktail party. More than anything The Big Year is a travelogue with the trio crisscrossing North America in search of rare species. Locales such as Minnesota Oregon Texas Arizona Alaska British Columbia even Florida are considered and given a few minutes of screentime. When one scene ends you can rest assured that the next scene will start in a completely different place with different weather and an entirely different bird to track down. Scores are kept throughout as Wilson Black and Martins characters all vie for the new world record. At 100 brisk minutes it all moves along rather fluidly. Did you know the bald eagles courtship ritual involves locking talons and then free-falling to Earth talon in talon? No me either and thats just one of the important pieces of trivia one could pick up in The Big Year. No you wont laugh out loud (AKA LOL) but theres a modicum of tension as to how the film will end. A very mild movie but in the nicest sense of the word.

By Peter Rainer Film critic October 14 2011 Save for later Saved Owen Wilson Jack Black and Steve Martin attend a Qamp;A on ""The Big Year"" in Los Angeles. Chris Pizzello/STF/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Im willing to concede that being a birder is a worthy pastime but is birding good movie material? Maybe it is if youre making a documentary for Animal Planet. The new bromantic comedy ""The Big Year"" starring Steve Martin Owen Wilson and Jack Black didnt exactly change my mind but every once in a while it captures a suitable-for-framing shot of an avian wonder. Assuming alas I havent been duped by a CGI effect.The human-based material is less wonderful. Martins Stu a wealthy businessman with an adoring wife (JoBeth Williams) and family and a palatial retreat in Vail Colo. is primed to retire and pursue his lifelong dream. This turns out to be placing in the real-life Big Year competition in which the winner spots the most species of birds in North America within one calendar year.Jack Blacks Brad is a computer code writer and layabout who wants to be the best at something - in this case bird-watching. He too sets out on his Big Year setting aside his weekends. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Both men have their sights set on Owen Wilsons unscrupulous Kenny a successful contractor whose 732 bird sightings is the current world record. Kennys wife (Rosamund Pike) has been undergoing fertility treatments and complains about his gallivanting which apparently wrecked a previous marriage. Hes determined to make this one work but if its a choice between helping out at home or holding on to his championship you can guess what he goes for. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Even though none of these guys is ready to kick the bucket ""The Big Year"" has an unmistakable affinity with ""The Bucket List"" another bromance that attempted the calisthenic feat of simultaneously tickling our funny bone plucking our heartstrings and draining our tear ducts. The problem is that director David Frankel and screenwriter Howard Franklin working off a nonfiction book by Mark Obmascik are experts at neither tickling plucking nor draining.Birding at least as practiced by the films trio is more than a hobby; its a passion. But passion is what is AWOL from ""The Big Year."" The movies low-key geniality is pleasant enough but whats missing is the comedy the nuttiness of infatuation. When Henry Fonda as a herpetologist in ""The Lady Eve"" said ""snakes are my life"" we could laugh at his ardor while still at the same time admiring him for it. Despite a few obligatory speeches about the wonder of it all the men in ""The Big Year"" are mostly into birding to win big. Birding here is about being the best that you can be at something which means in the films touchy-feely parlance finding out who you really are.But what if who you really are is someone who wants nothing more than to top 732 bird sightings? In the case of Kenny at least his redemption isnt all that convincing. When all is said and done Hollywood always admires a winner.One reason the real-life Big Year competition seems so phony is because its so confusingly laid out. The point is made that bird sightings are tabulated on the honor system which seems hard to believe. And despite the films egalitarian trappings its likely that only the well-heeled or the deep-in-debt can afford the competition at all. And how did these guys or at least Stu and Brad develop their birding expertise in the first place? Brad has a ""golden ear"" that can identify the most esoteric birdcalls - not something one generally hones while spending quality time in a cubicle or on a couch.Wilson and especially Black are doing their usual genial shtick - mugging for the camera telegraphing their jokes. Martin tries to inject some soul into his role but as is often the case when he is in subpar material he would have been better off writing his own dialogue. He seems too smart for this film.The large supporting cast for ""The Big Year"" includes Dianne Wiest Anjelica Huston and Brian Dennehy. What a waste that three of our finest actors are utilized as glorified bit players in such an instantly disposable comedy. Grade C+ (Rated PG for language and some sensuality.)

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The Big Year"" is about frequent fliers. And we dont mean the many feathered species that passionate peripatetic birders race to add to their tallies in an annual birding contest. Steve Martin Jack Black and Owen Wilson portray corporate honcho Stu Preissler software engineer Brad Harris and well-heeled contractor Kenny Bostick three fairly extreme occasionally underhanded birding competitors. Enjoyable though not quite classic the comedy is based on local author and former Denver Post reporter Mark Obmasciks 2004 nonfiction best seller about an event called the Big Year in which birders try to outdo one another by sighting the most birds within a specific geographical area in a calendar year. Kenny (Wilson) holds the previous years record and wants to repeat -- though he promises his wife Jessica that he just wants to set the pace of this years contest. Brad (Black) is a divorced software engineer for a nuclear power plant who provides an unobtrusive voice-over and much of the adventures gentleness. Their birding crisscrosses the continent taking them from Texas Gulf Coast to Canadas territories from the omnipresent damp of the Everglades to the frigid fields of Minnesota. It takes them away from quotidian responsibilities and home fires. Stus mate Edith (JoBeth Williams) cheers him on. Kennys wife Jessica (Rosa mund Pike) feels neglected. Not unlike their predecessors in the similarly toned ""City Slickers"" the male-crisis comedy of the early 90s Stu Brad and Kenny are relatable guys seeking new answers to intractable questions Whats my calling? How should I love? What truly matters? Obmasciks book is subtitled ""A Tale of Man Nature and Fowl Obsession."" And the movie -- directed by David Frankel and written by Howard Franklin -- gets at the obsession the manic energy captured in the writers tale. To his credit Frankel teases but doesnt overplay the slapstick. But ""The Big Year"" -- even with its pretty shots of beguiling fowl -- doesnt quite bag birder love. Its as if the filmmakers dont trust the audience to relate to the loopiness of its characters compulsions. Which isnt to say there isnt love in the air. Brad spies fellow birder Ellie (Rashida Jones). She shares his enthusiasms if not his attraction. Brad has a gift for recognizing to a species a birds call and song be it warble honk or caw. And most of the lessons of ""The Big Year"" are more about listening than they are about seeing. As Kennys wife Pike does a fluid job of depicting Jessicas building frustration without turning shrill. We cant miss the point that her construction-job redo of their house is a response to Kennys casual demolition of their nest. Of course casting Wilson helps audiences forgive to a point his domestic failings. The movie also touches on class -- it has to; these guys travel a lot -- as it makes friends of working guy Brad and corporate CEO Stu. When Stus wife Edith (Williams) calls from Paris shes got a glass of wine in her hand and a knockout view. Hes happily slumming in a motel. Brads sacrifice seems greatest because he pursues his Big Year while working full time. The cast features a roster of talented actors who inspire their own check-off list Brian Dennehy and Dianne Wiest are Brads parents (shes supportive; he doesnt get it). Anjelica Huston steps into hip-high galoshes as a salty Alaskan boat captain. The lessons Stu Brad and Kenny learn as they pursue their impossibly grand number of sightings sting or soothe. And while their epiphanies -- or blindness to them -- shouldnt surprise audiences they are fine reminders of the importance of asking oneself the bigger questions. Carrying the increasingly rare PG rating ""The Big Year"" has charms Not a jawdropping flock of them but a number of sweet insights and warm laughs just the same.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint You wonder what ideas they rejected before green lighting a movie about bird watching. Movies based on breakfast cereals? ""Farmville 3D""? A history of dirigibles? Watching ""The Big Year"" a slovenly mix of nature movie and buddy comedy you doubt that even the people making it enjoyed it. A better title would be ""The Big Yawn."" Owen Wilson Jack Black and Steve Martin are utterly uninvolving as competitive birders in a three-way duel to record the most species sightings in a year. Wilson plays the reigning champ a strutting peacock dressed in neon hues with an equally vivid ego. Black is a sweetly earnest office drone with a perfect pitch for bird calls and Martin is a CEO abandoning the rat race for the bird race. Since their competition is a yearlong ramble across the United States with no physical finish line you cant tell whos winning until the end. The bustle to reach each rare birds habitat is literally all over the place. The stars intersect at random with almost no give-and-take among the three men. As they zigzag from Alaska to Louisiana to Colorado were treated to pleasant Tourist Bureau panoramas (and a couple of rank-looking dumps) but scant entertainment. In a misguided attempt to create female interest in this story of men in the woods with binoculars three romantic/domestic subplots have been bolted onto the superstructure. Wilsons stay-at-home wife (Rosamund Pike) wants to conceive a baby Martins son and daughter-in-law deliver a grandchild and Black pines for a fellow birder (elfin Rashida Jones). These mawkish run-free-or-settle-down dilemmas slow the films negligible momentum to a crawl. If you carry any strong impression away from this unmemorable movie it will be of Steve Martins face apparently paralyzed by a Botox overdose. I liked him better when he had movable eyebrows. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox Murray Close) Bird-watching seems like a harmless hobby and Ive penciled it into the calendar for my golden years. But a movie about it calls for a loosey-goosey approach. Although the avian comedy ""The Big Year"" gathers a flock of funnymen it never musters the energy to soar.Based on a nonfiction book by Mark Obmascik ""The Big Year"" profiles three competitive bird-watchers. Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson) is a legend in the field an independently wealthy globetrotter who set a record for the most bird species spotted in a year. Stu Preissler (Steve Martin) is a retiring CEO who wants to challenge the record. And Brad Harris (Jack Black) is a meek divorced cubicle dweller who uses his vacation time and borrowed money to pursue his hobby.Each of these men is competing in whats called a big year 12 months of intense bird-watching to rack up a sighting count. Yet one of the strategies of the big year is to pretend youre not competing so during most of the movie theres no tension. The competitors mingle with casual bird-watchers and sometimes the three men are not even in the same locale at the same time. In the process we visit scenic corners of the country but learn surprisingly little about birds or the logistics of tracking them. Directed by David Frankel who made a dog movie that de-emphasized the dog (""Marley and Me"") and a fashion movie that de-emphasized the fashion (""The Devil Wears Prada"") ""The Big Year"" puts the focus on people who arent inherently interesting -- or funny. Kenny forsakes a wife (Rosamund Pike) who wants to have a baby Stu rebuffs the underlings who want him to return to work and Brad shyly romances a fellow traveler (Rashida Jones) who shares his interest in birdcalls. None of the subplots are a substitute for the flights of fancy wed expect if the stars were uncaged. Its nice to watch a comedy that doesnt screech or foul the nest but ""The Big Year"" is no big deal.

"The Big Year review At least the hats are funny |       NJ.com comments The Big Year review At least the hats are funny Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 14 2011 at 724 AM updated October 14 2011 at 1250 PM View/Post Comments (FOX)Steve Martin Jack Black and Owen Wilson go birding in ""The Big Year"" Youd probably call them ""birdwatchers."" But watching is just part of it and only comes in at the end. First theyve got to find the bird -- and that can involve bad weather and hard hikes. And occasionally some cutthroat competition as when these ""birders"" spend an entire year trying to tote up the highest number of spied sparrows owls egrets and other feathered friends. Thats the decidedly unusual setup for ""The Big Year"" a movie that takes three very different men -- lonely single Jack Black comfortable Montclair hubby Owen Wilson and rich retiree Steve Martin -- and sets them out on the road with some binoculars. Capably directed by David Frankel -- who last did ""Marley amp; Me"" with Wilson -- its a beautiful travelogue at least taking us from New York to Alaska and many points in between. We see lots of interesting birds. And we see an awful lot of this gorgeous country in a movie that could serve as a commercial for American tourism. Its just all unfortunately a little stronger on the pretty pictures than it is on interesting characters or sharp comedy. Admitted its a pleasant change to see a movie that doesnt immediately turn to locker room (and bathroom) humor for its jokes. But it would be nice if it turned somewhere. Few opportunities for slapstick or even visual humor are ever seized. Nor are the three characters terribly complex. Black is once again a grubby man-child (in pursuit of course of a woman decidedly out of his league). And while its good to see Steve Martin doing something besides a dopey remake theres no real depth or conflict to his character. Wilsons character at least has some drama to it. As a previous champion birder he feels compelled to defend his title; his eager-to-procreate wife is a little less enthused about him spending 12 months on the road. But he goes anyway because well hes kind of a heel -- and in this fairly bland movie that makes him interesting. In fact hes central to the movies theme -- that competition is something thats deep in a lot of men and has nothing to do with money or even prizes. Its bragging rights pure and simple -- the chance to have an excuse to tell everyone youre No. 1. At anything. Its a bit of a sad observation -- and when it finally comes into view at the end of the film it provides a bittersweet tang. Its unfortunate that it took such a long slightly dull slog to get to that one brief moment of course. But then thats birding for you. Ratings note The film contains some mildly strong language. The Big Year (PG) Fox (100 min.) Directed by David Frankel. With Steve Martin Jack Black Owen Wilson. Now playing in New Jersey.

Starring Jack Black Steve Martin Owen Wilson Rashida Jones Rosamund Pike Kevin Pollak Anjelica Huston Dianne Wiest JoBeth Williams Director David Frankel Release Opened Oct 14 2011  Editorial Review Comic potential never takes offBy Ann HornadayFriday Oct 14 2011Take three gifted comic actors put them in a situation rife with hilarious potential with the guy who directed ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and you get - baited and switched at least in the case of ""The Big Year."" Its not that theres anything particularly wrong with David Frankels adaptation of Mark Obmasciks book about competitive birding. In fact theres a lot thats right with it starting with the cast Jack Black plays Brad Harris a 30ish underachiever living with his parents in Baltimore; Steve Martin is Stu Preissler a wealthy tycoon who uses bird-watching as a way to escape the torpor of retirement; and Owen Wilson plays Kenny Bostick whose most recent Big Year - when birders try to see as many rare species as they can - racked up a record 732 sightings. When Brad and Stu make a run at Kennys record the game of ""The Big Year"" is afoot taking the three as far afield as the Aleutian Islands the Florida Everglades and points in between. Granted Frankel has stinted on nothing taking his cast to real-life locations once in a while giving the audience a glimpse of their beautiful flighty quarry. But somehow the comic chemistry never seems to ignite in ""The Big Year"" which burbles along at the clunky pace of a low-stakes chase; issues of male ego competitiveness and compensation are briefly addressed but never truly engaged and too often the three actors look and feel as if theyre in three different movies. (More than ""The Devil Wears Prada"" ""The Big Year"" resembles Frankels last film the warm fuzzy and bland ""Marley and Me."") Quiet genial and mild-mannered to a fault ""The Big Year"" has the virtue of being deeply un-cynical but at the expense of propulsive vigor structural elegance and behavior thats recognizably human as opposed to engineered in Hollywood. ""The Big Year"" has heart and sweetness to spare - but as any birder will tell you focus and energy count too.Contains profanity and some sensuality.

Credit the makers of ""The Big Year with trying something different -- a comedy set in the world of competitive birding thats neither a gross-out buddy movie nor a drippy chick flick. Yet despite the efforts of an excellent cast headed by three top comedy names -- Owen Wilson Steve Martin and Jack Black -- and tons of beautiful scenery (mostly British Columbia and the Canadian Yukon) this movie stubbornly refuses to take flight or generate more than a few chuckles. Blame meandering direction by David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada and a script (attributed to Howard Franklin working from a nonfiction book) loaded with expository dialogue over-explaining everything that happens and everything that everyone is feeling. This undermines the work of the stars playing fictionalized versions of three driven men who have undertaken one of the worlds quirkiest competitions. The Big Year as its called is won by the individual birder (they hate the term bird watcher) who records sightings of the largest number of different species in North America during a calendar year. The reigning champ played against type by the normally laid-back Wilson is Kenny an affluent New Jersey building contractor who has vowed to his third and latest wife (Rosamund Pike) that he wont compete again after capturing the title with 732 species. But thats only until the obsessive Kenny senses a serious challenge from a couple of newcomers to the competition. One is Stu (Martin) a wealthy industrialist who retires with the encouragement of his wife (JoBeth Williams) specifically to devote himself to a quest hes dreamed of all his life. At the other end of the economic spectrum is Brad (Black) a divorced software engineer at a Virginia nuclear power plant who maxes out his credit cards -- and those of his supportive mother (Dianne Wiest) -- much to the disgust of his father (Brian Dennehy). Neither Stu nor Brad are even willing to admit theyre participating in The Big Year when they first meet on a boat skippered by Anjelica Huston. But they gradually bond to compete against the ruthless Kenny who goes to great lengths to mislead his competitors. There is much racing across the continent -- from New England to Texas to a remote spot in the Aleutian Islands -- but not much insight into what drives this strange tribe including a female birder (Rashida Jones) who takes a shine to Brad. Black has a few pratfalls but eventually he and the other stars of ""The Big Year get sucked into schmaltzy subplots straight out of Hollywoods cliche playbook.

(Handout) BY Daily News Staff NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday October 14 2011 400 AM Title The Big Year With Jack Black Steve Martin Owen Wilson. Bird enthusiasts aim to win a competition. Director David Frankel (130). PG Language sensuality. At area theaters. Spotted A mainstream movie with wit and a bit of heart. Colors are white blond and brown. Tends to move around quickly if sometimes clumsily. Thats how a birder - remember its not ""bird watcher"" - might describe ""The Big Year"" a genial comedy with more power under its wings than it seems. This one could have flown over the cuckoos nest or smacked into a glass pane but instead lands in the middle of the road where quirky and popular meet. A Big Year as detailed in Mark Obmasciks source nonfiction book is an annual competition among avian aficionados to spot the most species across North America from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31. The winner gets bragging rights something Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson) enjoys. His 300-plus record has held for years though he wants another go at it despite his wifes (Rosamund Pike) plan for a family. Two others though are gunning for Bosticks number and they have long-delayed dreams on their side. Brad (Jack Black) is a cubicle worker who despite a divorce and job trouble has saved up enough to crisscross the continent. And Stu (Steve Martin) is finally retiring from the mega-company he started and aiming to live for himself. Stu may not have Bosticks instincts or Brads energy but he has money and endurance. As the trio keep crossing paths camaraderie and antagonism crop up and so does their shared devotion to a pastime some might call silly but which all three call a saving grace. Director David Frankel (""Marley amp; Me"") could have gone a few ways with this story. The most obvious one would have been to layer a ""Local Hero""-style whimsy onto a gentle Christopher Guest-like parody. Instead he turns Howard Franklins script into a mad-dash comedy reminiscent of ""Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" or even - it has to be said - ""The Cannonball Run."" Its certainly the more colorful choice one that will appeal to fans of its leading men. However the glimpses we see of Bosticks bent-but-not yet-broken marriage Brads disapproving father (a wonderfully cranky Brian Dennehy) and Stus unique business acumen suggest a calmer more astute movie fluttering around the edges. Yet with Black Martin and Wilson front and center its easy to refocus. Each is completely in his wheelhouse and Black especially gets to round out his leading-man resume thanks to Brads sweet wooing of a fellow birder (Rashida Jones). These guys are showing off their plumage and despite all the rushing around its a sight to see. Magic Moment Brad and his father go into a park to find a bird and come out with a real connection. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews the big year jack black steve martin owen wilson mark obmascik rosamund pike david frankel brian dennehy rashida jones Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The Big Year (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Big Year (PG) This comedy about competitive birdwatchers is strictly for the birds. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/13/2011 Editor rating 1 The trailer for The Big Year is one of the most deceptive ever made positing the film as a comedy about three guys who take a year from their lives to indulge in zany bucket-list adventures. Never once does the trailer mention what the trio is actually doing Competing in an annual contest to see who can spot the most rare birds. Why does The Big Years trailer intentionally hide what the film is really about? Heres why Because bird-watching -- or birding as practitioners prefer to call it -- makes for a stupefyingly boring movie. Inspired by Mark Obmasciks nonfiction book The Big Year A Tale of Man Nature and Fowl Obsession the movie has a potentially intriguing subject What sort of person would devote a year of his life flying around the country trying to spot a wider variety of birds than anyone else for the simple honor of having his name published in a birding magazine? Wealthy executive Stu (Steve Martin) married contractor Kenny (Owen Wilson) and divorced schlub Brad (Jack Black) are three such men willing to put their careers marriages and lives on hold so they can drive fly sail and hike to the furthermost reaches of the United States in order to lay eyes on one more breed of bird to add to their tally. Director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada Marley and Me) does his best to give the film an energetic pace emphasizing the breakneck excursions and sometimes dangerous antics the trio embark on in order to be crowned birder of the year. But while the extremes these people will go to for such a peculiar hobby are fascinating the movie is populated by shallow underwritten characters. Never do we really believe that Stu a powerful businessman about to become a grandfather would really give up his company or miss the birth of his grandson in order to chase after a pink-footed goose. Kenny the current birding record-holder defending his title ignores his beautiful wife who is undergoing hormonal treatments so they can have a baby. And Brad who still lives at home with his parents doesnt seem to be interested in anything in life other than birds -- at least until the story gives him an unlikely love interest (Rashida Jones) who shares his ornithology obsession. Despite constant attempts at humor via wordplay pratfalls and the occasional semi-improvisation by Martin and Black The Big Year is practically devoid of laughs -- I dont think I cracked a smile during the entire film -- and things get even worse when Frankel gives in to his sentimental streak and melodrama crashes the pictures third act. Theres a breathtaking shot in The Big Year of the mating ritual of bald eagles a stunning sight to behold and the movie does impart a sense of wonder about the natural world and sheer variety of birds that inhabit our continent. But the film is a complete dud as a comedy making you wish Obmasciks book had been turned into a documentary instead. Birders as obsessive as these must be fascinating people Their Hollywood counterparts sadly are not.

The actual laughs may be few but the story and characters will keep viewers entertained.About the movieThe Big Year  1/2 out of fourStars Steve Martin Jack Black Owen Wilson Rashida Jones Brian Dennehy Director David Frankel Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for language and some sensuality Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday nationwideMartin plays Stu Preissler a corporate bigwig contemplating retirement and settling down into a less high-powered existence with his wife Edith (JoBeth Williams). At the other end of the spectrum is 36-year-old Brad Harris played by Black who is still trying to figure out what he does best.Every place Stu and Brad go to watch birds they also have their sights trained on Kenny Bostick (Wilson) the self-proclaimed ""worlds greatest birder."" Kenny is a driven man a building contractor whose loving wife Jessica (Rosamunde Pike) longs for a baby. But he cant seem to focus on anything but sighting rare birds in a variety of habitats. His record of seeing 732 species has made him smug and mildly ruthless. He compares himself to Mozart and Lance Armstrong.Theres a friendly rivalry among the three men that might have been played up for more humor. But then again the stakes are low.The title refers to a contest in the world of bird aficionados that results in no money prizes or fame but it does confer modest honor. Those who undertake ""a big year"" tally how many species they see (or hear) during a calendar year on the honor system and the winners get their names published. A ""big year"" requires patience determination and the ability to take off to any spot in North America on a moments notice. The films more than 100 locations from the Yukon Territory to the Florida Everglades are gorgeous.Inspired by Mark Obmasciks book the tale focuses on universal themes of pursuing a dream and tapping into an adventurous spirit.Brads father (Brian Dennehy) thinks his son is wasting his time and money chasing birds around. Brad maxes out several credit cards which in a recession does smack of glaring waste.But the joy and peace it brings Brad Stu and even Kenny seems to be worth more than money.TheBig Year offers a glimpse into a little-known world. Its low-key and lightly amusing told at a tranquil pace appropriate for a film about gentle souls watching feathered creatures. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"The Big Year Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review The Big YearJack Black Owen Wilson and Steve Martin engage in competitive bird-watching while the script and director keep the humor clean.October 14 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Owen Wilson Steve Martin and Jack Black star in ""The Big Year."" (Murray Close / 20th Century...)If youre in the mood for some feathery fluff of the happy-sappy-and-not-wholly-unpleasant sort and need a break from snark there is ""The Big Year."" This weirdly whimsical family comedy about competitive birders stars Jack Black Owen Wilson and Steve Martin and yes the humor is exactly as nerdy as that sounds. Did you hear the one about the pink-footed goose a|? When toning down a comic trio that leans toward edgy to PG-lite the humor that results is more of the mildly mirthful bland um brand. Thus do not expect sidesplitting tear-producing moments of unbridled laughter but do plan on chortles. (Hey its about birds bird calls abound Im chortling so sue me.) As the story begins the three guys are strangers setting out on a quest to be the years top birder. Referred to by aficionados as going for ""the big year"" its a contest of who spots the most species of birds in North America in a single year. Theres no prize money its run on an honor system and its all very hush hush dont ask dont tell if you are having a go at the title. Wouldnt want to show your hand to the competition now would you? The guys are in varying stages of modern adult-male meltdowns which means theyve come to the party with flannel shirts binoculars birding notebooks and something to prove. Black plays Brad Harris a lowly computer programmer divorced and going nowhere with no one but a genius at identifying bird calls. Martin is Stu Preissler a captain of industry at the top of his game now looking to retire and give in to his weekend birding obsession. Wilson is Kenny Bostick the reigning birder with a record 732 sightings in one year but fearful that someone else might overtake him. And as simple as one two three writer Howard Franklin (""Someone to Watch Over Me"" ""Quick Change"") has covered the basic middle-through-upper class white-guy types. To handle this very quirky and fundamentally decent world director David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada"") has traded in every stitch of his high-end designer style and all his cutting ways. Instead he and cinematographer Lawrence Sher (""The Hangover"" and ""I Love You Man"") offer up a woodsy amusement park that has the feel of something plucked right out of the 50s ""Leave It to Beaver"" school when things like the honor system actually worked. Or so we thought. The conflicts arise as Stu Brad and Bostick (no one calls him Kenny except the wife played by Rosamund Pike who wishes hed stay home long enough to do a little chick-producing nesting) sort through their issues and try to outwit and out-watch one another to the top. The scenery is beautiful as they crisscross the country following the latest tip and the filmmaker makes time to let those so inclined drink in all that outdoor splendor. As it happens there are quite a lot of bird life lessons to be plucked a loyalty endurance dont count the ordinary bird out a and even more just plain bird lore worth dispensing. Its done cleverly for the most part with close-ups of real rare fowl along with some facts or sometimes just a John Madden-style playbook scrawl noting a sighting across a shot of the kind of pristine countryside you can forget still exists. As with any sport things can get dirty (chum is just nasty stuff) and ones character is tested. Family ties also tug at each of the guys. Stus life seems picture perfect with JoBeth Williams as his very understanding wife but theres a grandchild on the way. Bostick has that procreation problem. Brad is the most complex in this very un-complex world a his dad (Brian Dennehy) thinks his birding is nuts his mom (Dianne Wiest) is determined her boy will live his dream and Ellie (Rashida Jones) is a bird-calling sweetheart whom Brad has his eye on. Nothing surprising happens really. Friendships are formed and fractured tough choices are made understanding and insight are woven in between those chortles I mentioned earlier. No one does a particularly outstanding job but no one does too badly either. Black only arches that mischief-signaling eyebrow once or twice Wilson does affable affably and Martin plays fatherly with restraint (or is he simply bored?). ""The Big Year"" might not soar (and you do wonder what fun Christopher ""Best in Show"" Guest might have had with the competitive birding world) but there is some harmless pleasure to be found when feathers arent ruffled when the fowl is not foul. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTo the Wonder producers and Ben Affleck on Eberts final...April 11 2013Book review I Beat the Odds by Michael Oher with Don...February 7 2011Local Performing Arts Take Center StageJune 27 1996The Readers Respond to Moviemakers Movie Critics and You...November 4 1990MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentHonor SystemCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-the-big-year-20111014,0,4409375.story?track=rss",200,thebigyear16,thebigyear,latimes

More about The Big Year >> Inspired by Mark Obmasciks nonfiction book David Frankels film observes the migratory patterns of three breeds of birders. Do they criss-cross the country from Alaskas Aleutians to Floridas Everglades because they feel trapped by their lives? Or because by observing avian life they better understand humans? Yes and maybe suggests this gently eccentric film from Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada Marley amp; Me). Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson) Americas top-ranked birder is hooked on the thrill of the hunt and defines himself by his status as most successful birdman to the extent that he both physically and emotionally abandons his wife Jessica (Rosamund Pike). Stu Preissler (Steve Martin) a tycoon on the brink of retirement trades the combative adventure of business for the contemplative adventure of birding fighting his mortality by taking on the younger Bostick. ""Theyre men"" says Edith (JoBeth Williams) Stus supremely tolerant wife with a shrug. ""If they stop competing theyll die."" Brad Harris (Jack Black) an office drone living with his parents after his divorce simply wants to get out of his cage. Although the frenemies fly drive and boat to remote places in pursuit of woodcocks and eagles and boobys the birds are only the pretext of the story about obsessives each trying to prove something to himself. One wishes the birds were photographed with the care and love that documentarians brought to Winged Migration (or with the care that Frankel lights his stars.) But for one scene where Brad delivers an ode to the golden plover an ordinary-looking bird with unique qualities like Brad himself and another of the breathtaking mating dance of bald eagles talons linked as they spiral to earth theres not much birdwatching to be had here. But there is ample stargazing. Wilson is cagy fun as the ruthless birder and Martin droll as the executive. Black whose character narrates the picture but is otherwise underwitten has a nice scene with Brian Dennehy as his Dad and another with Dianne Wiest as Mom. Rashida Jones brings warmth and mockingbird humor to a small role as Blacks crush. With ambitions greater than comedy and results that fall short of character study The Big Year is neither fish nor fowl. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Could go either way. The Big Year Fair to good Director David Frankel. Cast Owen Wilson Jack Black Steve Martin. Rating PG for language and some sensuality. This weeks new movie releases With ""The Big Year"" it goes neither. You get something you dont anticipate -- and thats not a bad thing. Director David Frankels film based loosely on Mark Obmasciks book is a more muted affair than you would expect. Sure there are laughs and Black takes a pratfall or two but ""The Big Year"" is more a story about obsessive personalities caught up in a competition to see the most birds than it is a buddy comedy. Black Martin and Wilson talk The Big Year In fact these guys arent really buddies certainly not at the outset. Oh and please forgive the ""bird-watching"" reference above. To these folks its birding and they take it very seriously. Brad Harris (Black) writes computer code and scrounges together money to go birding. His gift After years of obsessive listening he can identify any bird just by its song. Stu Preissler (Martin) is a titan of industry who longs to retire and look at the birds literally. He wants to do a Big Year -- to see as many species of birds as he can logging them as he goes. Kenny Bostick (Wilson) knows all about that. He has done a big year and has in fact set the world record for most species spotted. And yet he is not satisfied. The siren call of the birds keeps him restless and unfulfilled to the chagrin of his latest wife Jessica (Rosamund Pike). None of them in other words is content with his life and each believes a Big Year will scratch whatever itch is plaguing him. But as Kennys string of broken marriages attests a Big Year is a total commitment; you have to be ready to jet off at any time to where the birds are. This isnt as big a financial difficulty for Stu or Kenny a successful contractor. For Brad however its a trickier proposition. Kenny is ruthless purposely misleading his competitors. Stus only nod to this kind of thing is to deny that hes doing a Big Year -- standard practice to keep other birders complacent. Brad is the underdog thanks to his financial standing (hes maxing out credit cards to make trips). Stu and Brad will bond over the course of the year though the story dabbles a bit too much in a man-makes-friend man-loses-friend man-makes-it-up plot line. Happily Frankel allows Kenny to remain pretty much an aloof jerk. If you have known this kind of person you know thats accurate -- Kenny is not going to see a light at the end of the tunnel unless theres a bird inside. Brad falls for a fellow birder (Rashida Jones) and works to mend fences with his disapproving dad (Brian Dennehy); Jones and Dennehy arent given much beyond the obvious to do and neither story line is very effective. ""The Big Year"" is better when it is examining the obsession of the birders and Martin Black and Wilson are enjoyable in toned-down mode. But the film would have been more rewarding had Frankel gone a little deeper into that obsession and what it costs those who give in to it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

By Mary Pols MaryPolsOct. 12 2011 Share Read Later Murray Close / Twentieth Century FoxTim Blake Nelson left and Owen Wilson look to the skies for inspiration in a scene from The Big Year. The Big Year Year 2011 Director David Frankel Studio Fox Pictures Actors Owen Wilson Jack Black and Steve Martin Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture One of the wives in the slight but affable comedy The Big Year watches as her husband Stu (Steve Martin) vies with his adult son for bragging rights in a skiing contest. ""Theyre men dear"" Edith (JoBeth Williams) says to her daughter-in-law sounding fond resigned and also slightly patronizing. Stu is about to spend a year trying along with two other men (Owen Wilson and Jack Black) for the unusual honor of being named the worlds best birder. ""If they ever stop competing they die."" Yuck. If The Big Year only offered proof of this sweeping generalization it might be a chest-thumping extravaganza that does no favors to men or the women who gaze fondly upon them. But director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada and Marley amp; Me) goes for an underlying message about how the joy of experience -- spending a calendar year racking up sightings of hundreds of distinct bird species -- trumps the thrill of trouncing others. That sounds awfully greeting-card-ish but The Big Year works as a light candy-bright comedy in the City Slickers vein a live-action movie with grownups and without talking animals suitable for the whole family. A Big Year competition does takes place annually in North America. Its casual in the sense that no one enters; they just start and all results are reported on the honor system. Mark Obmasik chronicled the 1998 competition in his 2004 book of the same name which provided the loose basis for Howard Franklins screenplay. In that banner year three men each spotted over 700 species. If the movie is true to life this almost quaint endeavor to glimpse and identify the small winged gems of nature can also be a selfish enterprise involving considerable sacrifice to personal and professional relationships not to mention incurring vast travel expenses entailed in ditching ones regular life to dash off to remote locations at a moments notice. Two of the competitors can well afford it. Reigning champion Kenny Bosticks (Wilson) only responsibility seems to be to get his pretty fertility-challenged wife Jess (Rosamund Pike) pregnant an obligation most would enjoy. But Kenny is more interested in birding. ""Its my calling"" he tells Jess. ""Like Gandhi?"" she says arching an eyebrow. Business tycoon Stu Preissler could retire in style if his needy employees (Joel McHale and Kevin Pollak) and personal work ethic would allow it; Stus hopes his Big Year will help him transition into retirement. The underdog is Brad Harris (Jack Black) a computer whiz who moved in with his crabby father (Brian Dennehy) and supportive mother (Dianne Wiest) after getting ditched by his wife for his bird obsession. He maxes out six credit cards in pursuit of the title and has to continue to work full time but is blessed with an extraordinarily sharp ear for bird sounds. Black fans may hardly recognize him because for once he plays a person instead of a walking comedy mask atop a Buddha belly. For the first time in years I didnt want to run in the opposite direction from his smirk. I even rooted for him to get the lady birder (Rashida Jones) they keep bumping into even though shes a little too good to be true (shes working on a gentler ambition building up her life list of birds spotted not a Big Year). With three male leads who tend to be big forces of nature themselves the movie could have been a bravado fest but instead they all play it small. Martin has seemed like hes faking something ever since his moved into the post Father of the Bride phase of his career but he seems more comfortable playing fatherly opposite Black than usual. Its not often that a mainstream movie focuses on an eccentric subset of the population without turning them into grotesques or cute little goofballs. These birders have technology on their side -- a blogger named Ichabod Crane (Big Bang Theorys Jim Parsons) keeps everyone up to date on the race and they get daily phone updates about obscure sightings. But there is still a quixotic aspect to searching for something so elusive in vast and varied landscapes and the movie captures something of that. Frankel shows the birders fanning out across the rugged terrain of the avian paradise of Attu Island (with the Yukon subbing for the Aleutian Island) on bicycles and as they visually bag their prey the names of various species pop up all over the landscape scrawled on the screen. Its like an Easter egg hunt for adults joyous and sweet. The Big Year competition may be fierce but the movie is as soft as a bunny.

E-mail| Print| Text size - + Youd have to really love birding as much as the guys here do to enjoy the strained buddy comedy ""The Big Year"" to its fullest potential.Except for some lovely scenery and a few lively interactions between the three stars -- Steve Martin Owen Wilson and Jack Black -- ""The Big Year"" feels like the long cross-country schlep that it is. And in the pursuit of what? The title of spotting the most bird species in North America over the course of a calendar year something extremely specific that will probably only interest a few people in the audience.Yes of course the journey is the destination and whatnot. And The Big Year competition itself is merely a device an allegory for the desire these three men have to prove their worth at this particular moment in their lives. If that werent obvious to us already the voiceover-heavy script spells out everything these people are thinking or regretting or learning from this magical experience.David Frankels film based on the non-fiction book by Mark Obmascik begins in lively fashion in introducing its characters and establishing its premise as you might expect from the director of ""The Devil Wears Prada."" (Frankel also previously directed Wilson in ""Marley amp; Me."") But it quickly grows repetitive as Martin (as retiring corporate CEO Stu Preissler) Wilson (as the cutthroat reigning champ Kenny Bostick) and Black (as divorced cubicle-dwelling newbie Brad Harris) go to extremes chase each other around and race against the clock.Its a mad mad mad mad bird.Along the way Stu and Brad form an easy friendship despite coming from opposite ends of the success spectrum. Watching these two extremely different comic actors team up and play off each other provides one of the few natural joys in a film that too often relies on heartwarming schmaltz.Sharing screen time with the various geese and eagles and owls is a ridiculously strong cast of supporting actors most of whom dont get enough to do. They include Brian Dennehy Dianne Weist Joel McHale and Kevin Pollak; even the brief narration at the start explaining the history of The Big Year comes from John Cleese.JoBeth Williams enjoys a few deadpan zingers as Stus inordinately understanding wife while Rosamund Pike provides some substance to what could have been a naggy one-note role as Kennys wife who longs to have a baby and is increasingly frustrated with his absence and obsession. Anjelica Huston meanwhile has some amusing moments as a no-nonsense birding tour guide in Oregon (just the sight of her in braided pigtails suspenders and a plaid shirt is good for an initial laugh).Ultimately though the who-cares? factor in watching men chase birds is just too insurmountable. ""The Big Year"" flaps its wings awfully hard but never truly takes flight.""The Big Year"" a Fox 2000 release is rated PG for language and some sensuality. Running time 99 minutes.

"Big Year movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Big Year For the birds not the laughs -- 2 starsOctober 13 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticSteve Martin Jack Black and Owen Wilson star in ""The Big Year.""Surely a richer human comedy can be made about an eccentric subculture of obsessive birders than ""The Big Year"" in which Steve Martin Jack Black and Owen Wilson spend a lot of time peering through binoculars at one species or another. Curious audiences will not be subjected to ""Little Fockers""-level slapstick here. This is a gentle diffident concoction. But it has barely enough pulse to power a hummingbird. Economic recessions tend to bring out the ""must be nice"" response in movie audiences. Since ""The Big Year"" concerns three men (one rich one pretty rich one not) who spend 12 months and untold thousands of recreational dollars crisscrossing North America racking up sightings and vying for the title of worlds greatest birder the makers of this film can reasonably expect a certain amount of must-be-nice in response. Screenwriter Howard Franklin goes his own way with the nonfiction book of the same name inventing a trio of characters based a teeny-tiny bit on real-life central figures chronicled by journalist Mark Obmascik. Our leader the one who narrates is Brad a divorced computer whiz played by Black. He dreams of embarking on a ""big year"" which in the birding universe means near-constant often last-minute travel to various climates and locales from the desert to the Everglades to the Aleutian Islands. Brad dreams of besting the birding record-holder a contractor (Wilson) who once identified 732 separate species in a year. His blase confidence in breaking his own record provokes the competitive industrialist played by Martin. The birding of course is handily symbolic as well as literal. Brad dives headlong into this world partly to escape the confines of an ordinary life and like the Paul Giamatti character in the infinitely more distinctive wonky-subculture comedy ""Sideways"" he favors the species of birds others tend to overlook. (Brian Dennehy and Dianne Wiest nicely cast play Brads parents.) Through birding he meets a fellow obsessive played by Rashida Jones the brightest spot in a mild picture. The Wilson character turns his consuming preoccupation into a wall separating him from his wife (Rosamund Pike) with whom he is having fertility challenges. Martins character meantime is becoming a grandfather and sees birding as a way of keeping both the burdens of his millions and questions of mortality at bay. The three men are not quite friends and not quite enemies and while a different sort of schlocky Hollywood treatment of ""The Big Year"" mightve gone hog wild with humiliating tit-for-tat competitive strategies director David Frankel settles for mellower stuff pleasant when its working (which is occasionally) blandly noncommittal when its not. Actors on the order of Anjelica Huston (as a coastal Oregon seafarer) come and go without making much of an impression which is saying something. I like nearly everybody on screen in ""The Big Year"" but the materials so intent on avoiding caricature or indeed any sort of social satire it neglects to make the characters any sort of funny. mjphillipstribune.com The Big Year -- 2 stars MPAA rating PG (for language and some sensuality) Cast Steve Martin (Stu); Jack Black (Brad); Owen Wilson (Kenny); Brian Dennehy (Raymond); Anjelica Huston (Annie); Rashida Jones (Ellie); Rosamund Pike (Jessica); Dianne Wiest (Brenda); JoBeth Williams (Edith) Credits Directed by David Frankel; written by Howard Franklin based on the book by Mark Obmascik; produced by Karen Rosenfelt Stuart Cornfeld and Curtis Hanson.

Share Tweet All evidence suggests that Steve Martin contracted the comedy-suppressing disease that explains so much about his later career sometime between the ambitious early-1991 film L.A. Story and the Christmas 1991 release Father Of The Bride an uninspired remake of the Vincente Minnelli classic that heavily features the telltale symptom of Martins Concerned-Dad Face. Martin fights his way back to health every once in a while and until now his condition hasnt seemed infectious. But in The Big Year a fictionalized adaptation of Mark Obmasciks non-fiction book of the same name co-stars Owen Wilson and Jack Black appear on the verge of succumbing to the same terminal blandness thats gripped Martin for so long. The three star as avid birders each on the verge of embarking on the titular ""big year"" a yearlong continent-spanning quest to see who can spot the most species of birds in North America. Martin plays a captain of industry on the verge of retirement who keeps getting sucked back into the corporate world. As he embarks on his big year he faces competition from Wilson a former champ whose hypercompetitive approach to birding has earned him a reputation as the pastimes bad boy. Black who provides twinkly-eyed narration co-stars as a workaday divorcee with bad eating habits and an uncanny talent for spotting rare birds. Over the course of the year paths cross and uneasy alliances form as they traipse from the Gulf Of Mexico--where a freak storm blows in an uncommon assortment of birds--to Attu at the far reaches of the Aleutian Islands. At least director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada Marley amp; Me) captures some nice scenery. Otherwise theres little to fill out a film that at least has the good sense not to take on any more dramatic weight than its hollow bones can handle--each character works through some personal issues but theyre fairly pat. Problem is it doesnt offer much comedy instead. Or for that matter much insight into birding. The Big Year never captures what draws these characters to their passion and as this granny-pleasing butterscotch candy of a movie drags from one end of the calendar to the other it starts to feel as if they might as well be collecting stamps. Surely a movie about that couldnt be any less funny. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review The Thing Next Movie Review Footloose Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Seeking to capture the fan/collectors/enthusiast gene ""The Big Year"" uses Mark Obmasciks book about obsessed ""birders"" and transforms it into a genial if slow-moving almost sleepy comedy. Steve Martin Jack Black and Owen Wilson play the central trio -- each at different stages of lives they put on hold to pursue their shared passion -- in a contest to eclipse what amounts to the Babe Ruth home run record of bird watching. Director David Frankels pic delivers sweet and (more rarely) amusing moments but this odd duck never completely gets off the ground and box office ought to mirror that flight path. Loosely inspired by Obmasciks chronicle of three men vying to top each other during ""the Big Year"" competition in 1998 Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Marley amp; Me"" reunited here with Wilson) and screenwriter Howard Franklin loosely start with that template as a foundation to explore whats really important -- the ways people and their loved ones accommodate activities that become all-consuming. ""You cant compare golf to this. Golf is like a hobby"" explains Wilsons Kenny Bostick to his frustrated wife (Rosamund Pike) later trying to rationalize missed events and blown deadlines by saying ""This is what Im great at."" Indeed Bostick holds the birder record having sighted 732 North American birds in a single ""big year"" which beckons to his two principal competitors Stu Preissler (Martin) a rich businessman whose wife (JoBeth Williams) is more resigned to his yearlong flight of fancy than are his harried subordinates who keep pleading with him to put out fires at work; and Brad Harris (Black) a divorced 36-year-old computer programmer who gets a mixed reaction to his obsession from his adoring supportive mom (Dianne Wiest) and gruff dad (Brian Dennehy). Given Kennys ruthlessly competitive nature Stu and Brad (who doubles as the narrator) strike up an unlikely friendship. Mostly though the protagonists paths intersect fitfully as they crisscross the continent responding to weather and seasonal patterns that will theoretically help them pad their totals. Beyond the leads Frankel and company have aided their cause immeasurably by casting the movie to the hilt with accomplished actors like Rashida Jones Tim Blake Nelson Anjelica Huston and Jim Parsons in what amount to minimal ""there are worse ways to spend your TV hiatus"" roles. Pic also makes appropriate use of various avian-related songs including ""Surfin Bird"" as Brads ringtone. That said the story unfolds slowly and the running tally of bird sightings and calendar dates popping up onscreen only provide a frequent reminder of the laborious march until Dec. 31 when the competition ends. Nor does ""Big Year"" completely work as a travelogue despite destinations that range from a remote Alaskan island to the Everglades. Like the central characters the narrative cant see the forest as it were for the birds. For all that there are some welcome aspects to the production including a lack of big slapstick elements. Yet by eschewing broad easy laughs Frankel only reinforces a sense of this being less a bigscreen comedy than an inordinately well-cast Hallmark movie. Admittedly there ought to be room for this sort of unassuming exercise movie in the theatrical space but given the shifting winds a project like that has to be almost pitch-perfect to stick the landing. As is ""The Big Year"" is pleasant enough but finally suffers -- pardon the analogy -- from being neither fish nor fowl.

Daily Edition Login to download The Big Year Film Review 1003 PM PDT 10/12/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A genial amusing and somewhat unfathomable about three guys for whom birdwatching takes precedence over all else in life. TWITTER This film may not do for birds what director David Frankels last film ""Marley amp; Me"" did for dogs but theres a similar current of warmth and appreciation for the effect of animals on people to be felt writes Todd McCarthy. Any movie in which one of the leading men would rather race off to some far-flung spot to observe a snowy owl than impregnate an anxiously waiting Rosamund Pike automatically has something going against it but then The Big Year is about unreasonable obsession. That the cause of the mens mania is birding -- the proper term we learn for bird watching -- makes this an unlikely prospect for mass audience interest. But the uniformly winning cast led by Steve Martin Jack Black and Owen Wilson and the ultra-accessible touch provided by director David Frankel provide for a constant steam of gentle mirth if not huge laughs. This film may not do for birds what Frankels last film Marley amp; Me did for dogs but theres a similar current of warmth and appreciation for the effect of animals on people to be felt. The gentlemen in question are at different stages of life and crisis. Martins Stu Preissler is a corporate giant a rich man ready to quit the rat race who believes hes not entitled to spend a year chasing all over North America in order to spot as many indigenous birds in the wild as possible no matter how hard his underlings at headquarters try to lure him back. By contrast Blacks Brad Harris is an under-achieving overweight computer nerd who somehow believes that winning the ""big year"" competition for bird spotting will justify him in the eyes of his disapproving father. Accomplishing this will be a tall order however as Wilsons Kenny Bostwick a building contractor set the bar very high by winning the prior years event with 732 species sightings a record hell likely not willingly relinquish. It all seems quite silly of course devoting an entire year to racing around from destinations as distant as Florida and Alaska and to dozens of points in between on a mad quest to spot more diverse fowl than anyone else especially while accompanied by crowds of like-minded fanatics. And the placid acceptance and even enthusiastic support of the women for their mens aberrant preoccupation seems like sheerest fantasy; this isnt Friday night with the boys at the corner bar or a couple of weeks visiting spring training camp in Arizona its more than 10 months away from home. And the dollars needed for the constant flights motels and restaurants are scarcely mentioned. But hard as it is for an outsider to comprehend the fixation at the center of it all it does serve as a highly scenic substitute for any other enthusiasm one could imagine. Hapily the genial competitiveness among the trio evolves nicely and is fortunately not pushed into archly idiotic realms. When pressed Kenny puns that birding is his ""calling"" and he means it insisting that as opposed to his day job ""This is what Ill be remembered for."" At first the three consider it important not to reveal that theyre plotting a ""big year"" for fear of pushing the competition to more aggressive lengths. But in a charming dinner scene Stu relaxes the talkative Brad into admitting it and before long the two contenders enter into a pact to beat Kenny. The latter views his mission as seriously as a pro athlete takes his sport much to the distress of his beautiful wife (Pike) whom he forces to spend altogether too much time alone. Working from Mark Obmasciks 2004 non-fiction tome The Big Year A Tale of Man Nature and Fowl Obsession screenwriter Howard Franklin doesnt delve too deeply into realistic life issues which is probably just as well as Frankel has little trouble filling out the episodic tale with amiable human comedy and settings worthy of a first-rate travelogue. Using locations mostly found in British Columbia and the Yukon to represent myriad U.S. sites the film is a constant eyeful not only for the backdrops but for the innumerable winged ones caught in their natural habitats; the most amazing shot is of courting bald eagles hooking talons and swirling together into a ritual free-fall. The second most astonishing sight is of Kenny having pledged to his wife that hell make his absence up to her fleeing from his conjugal promises the moment he learns he might be able to spot the bird thats long eluded him. Its one thing when obsessions are driven by some deep creative or productive urge but birding? Almost equally incredible is that a birder as fetching as Rashida Jones might take a fancy to Blacks unprepossessing nice guy a match akin to a scarlet tanager pairing up with a penguin. The three leads arent pushed to stretch at all but nor do they need to be. Their pleasing affability is amplified by the satisfaction of a supporting cast surprising deep in welcome familiar faces beginning with Pike Jones and Brian Dennehy as Brads father but also including Anjelica Huston Dianne Wiest JoBeth Williams Tim Blake Nelson and Kevin Pollak among others.

(Birders get very sensitive about terminology.) It would be nasty and convenient to say that its the worst comedy ever made about birding. The truth however is that its an amiably formulaic ever-so-slightly original comedy that isnt in the end very good. Yet the more I sat through it the more it won me over in its very benign high-concept way. Its like City Slickers remade for the Discovery Channel. The movie loosely based on a true story is about three outwardly mild-mannered men all of whom leave their daily lives behind to engage in what is known in birding as a ""Big Year"" -- an entire calendar year of hopping around North America all to see who can spot the most species. Owen Wilson plays the reigning world champion with a record 732 sightings. Hes so intent on defending and outdoing his record that he abandons his wife (Rosamund Pike) even as shes in the midst of trying with the aid of hormone treatments to have a baby with him. Steve Martin is the wealthy CEO who pursues his Big Year to avoid the threatening prospect of retirement and Jack Black is a 36-year-old divorced loser-slacker who launches his Big Year bankrolled by his mom (Dianne Wiest) as part of a grand refusal to grow up. The characters are just as two-dimensional as they sound but damned if Wilson Martin and Black dont make those dimensions pop. Since birding operates on the honor system theres no real mischief or chicanery to draw you into The Big Year. Its just a zig-zaggy light comedy about three friendly rivals hopping planes to the outer islands of Alaska or rushing toward a storm center to watch birds drop out of the sky. At certain points you may think Whats next a comedy about stamp collecting? Obsessing over birds can sound silly yet what I found oddly touching about The Big Year is that it celebrates the idea that no obsession when you think about is really very rational. B?

Theres no prize and not much glory but its a quest that sends the most dedicated to travel widely for 12 months in order to claim victory. The new comedy ""The Big Year"" is equally relentless in its pursuit schlepping its cast from coast to coast and out to the furthest reaches of Alaska and while it never quite captures greatness in its binoculars the result is a pleasant-enough voyage. We meet and follow a trio of birders who couldnt be more different Returning champ Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson) cant stop himself from defending his crown even if it interferes with the home-renovation and egg-fertilization projects he winds up leaving solely in the hands of his wife Jessica (Rosamund Pike); Stu Preissler (Steve Martin) a retired CEO whos thrilled to leave the rat race behind in pursuit of birding glory; and Brad Harris (Jack Black) a 30-something divorce still living with his parents who cobbles together his meager resources in the hopes that pulling off a Big Year will finally allow him to amount to something. So basically this is a sports movie with the search for snowy owls and pink-footed geese taking the place of boxing or basketball or whatever. The characters will show their true colors by the way they compete and their personal relationships will flourish or wither depending on their ability to compartmentalize their obsessions. Pike one of my favorite rising young actresses gets more mileage than you might imagine out of the neglected wife role -- it helps that screenwriter Howard Franklin (""Quick Change"") and director David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada"") resist making her into a two-dimensional shrew. (Or in bird terms a shrike.) Given the films gentle laconic nature it feels like the filmmakers were shooting for something along the lines of the British classic Ealing Studios comedies of the 1950s but despite the talented cast -- which also includes Angelica Huston Dianne Weist Rashida Jones Tim Blake Nelson JoBeth Williams Joel McHale and Kevin Pollak -- ""The Big Year"" never feels like it hits its own comic potential. (As a friend of mine used to say about ""The Tracey Ullmann Show"" its more smile-inducing than laugh-generating.) But even if ""The Big Year"" doesnt entirely jell its a movie thats too charming to dislike. Black Martin and Wilson have all made some painful big-screen choices of late (oy with the ""Gullivers Travels"" and ""The Pink Panther 2"" and ""Drillbit Taylor"" already) but they all drop the shtick for once and actually play characters. Yes Black cant resist the temptation to fall down a time or two but they never condescend to their characters all-consuming passion for a pastime that many would find ludicrous. You dont have to be a birder yourself to fall for ""The Big Year."" Whether youve memorized the names of every Red Sox relief pitcher or read every issue of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" or collected every piece of radioactive Fiestaware youll relate to the monomania on display here.

By Rex Reed  10/11/11 721pm Wilson Black and Martin. The Big Year is arguably the best movie ever made about ... bird watching? Yes you heard me right. Now theres a subject that should have them lined up around the block fighting to get in. Maybe Im wrong. A lot of people pay dues to join the Audubon Society. I am not one of them. So we have this movie see directed by David Frankel who directed The Devil Wears Prada so you have a right to expect something special. Oh Mona how to break the news gently. Its not so much awful as well not there at all. I mean it disappears faster than a yellow-chested finch whose bird feeder has been invaded by raccoons. Anyway its about three grown men who never reached maturity chasing their dream. They call themselves ""birders"" and their dream happens to be searching for birds through binoculars from tree limbs mountain tops boat ferries ... you name it; if its got feathers theyre watching it. They are Stu (Steve Martin) a high-powered businessman CEO with money fame and an understanding wife who is willing to throw away everything he spent his life working for to watch birds; Kenny (Owen Wilson) an arrogant selfish S.O.B. with no responsibilities and no loyalty to anybody who even leaves his beautiful wife in the middle of sex to watch a bird migration over Houston Texas; and Brad (Jack Black) a porcine loser who doesnt leave anybody or anything behind because he hasnt got a girl or a job in the first place. Birders who walk away from their lives and families to devote 12 months to birding become part of a competition called ""The Big Year."" The object is to see who can spot and identify the highest number of bird species in North America. No prize no reward no money at the end--just the pleasure of photographing a red-tailed hawk before anybody else does. Kenny is the reigning champion who lies cheats and double-crosses his friendly rivals to hold his title while the others struggle to keep up with him. The entire movie is about how they destroy marriages walk out on business mergers and spend their savings on airfares. In a Brownsville garbage dump Stu spots a vulture. Kenny compares birding with Mozarts composing. One lady birder is attacked by a mob of birds because her scarf from Bergdorfs was used to wipe up bird bait. (""Hitchcockian"" drawls Owen Wilson in a voice as boiled as an owl.) It all drags on endlessly in the same paralyzed pace. See the ink-footed goose in Boston. Catch that flamingo in the Everglades. From Des Moines to Yosemite National Park to Galveston while the guys hop into boats helicopters and rented cars. In the middle of setting up an oxygen tank for his father after the old man suffers a heart attack Brad even drops everything and heads for the airport to see something with a beak. O.K. so they follow their dream but you dont like any of these jerks while theyre doing it and you dont learn anything new when its over. You do see a lot of gnatcatchers plovers terns grosbeaks titmice teals scamps yellow throats sapsuckers egrets gulls woodpeckers and dippers while the sound track plays a song called ""I Like Birds."" I found them immensely more appealing than the people who were chasing them. Steve Martin has isolated moments trying in vain to choke some humor out of a film that is only slightly less amusing than a case of bird fever but hes got his work cut out for him sharing the screen with Jack Black and Owen Wilson two of the screens most annoying unsolved mysteries. Woody Allen knew exactly what to do with Mr. Wilsons flaws capitalizing on his broken nose and an irritating voice that forms exaggerated vowels that stay lodged in his sinus cavities. Jimmy Stewart had an annoying voice too but he could act. Im not sure anyone knows what to do with Jack Black. If they do its a carefully guarded secret. I wish all the agony in The Big Year was leading up to something fascinating in the end but the most inviting thing in the movie was the exit door. rreedobserver.com THE BIG YEAR Running Time 90 minutes Written by Howard Franklin Directed by David Frankel Starring Owen Wilson Jack Black and Steve Martin 2/4 Comment Filed under Audubon Society Bird Watching David Frankel Jack Black movie Owen Wilson Steve Martin Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/10/the-big-year-is-fowl-play/,200,thebigyear31,thebigyear,observer
