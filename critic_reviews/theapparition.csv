Comments (2) The Apparition Video Rated PG-13  82 minutes  2012 This horror movie from Warner Bros. is nothing special but its nice to see a modest genre entertainment buoyed by a major studios resources. Writer-director Todd Lincoln making his feature debut gives this a slick handsome look lingering whenever possible on the detailed production design and there are impressive helicopter shots of the desert locations. Ashley Greene and Sebastian Stan (a likable supporting actor in Captain America and David Mackenzies Spread) are believably vulnerable as a housesitting couple haunted by some sort of paranormal entity they really seem to enjoy each others company which makes you sorry the supernatural should interrupt their romance.

"A horror movie that makes real estate real scary - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate A horror movie that makes real estate real scary Share Tweet Share Tweet By Mark Feeney Globe Staff | 08.27.12 | 1035 AM The Apparition"" begins with near-scholarly specificity. An introduction informs us that on May 21 1973 a group of researchers conducted ""The Charles Experiment"" an attempt to summon the spirit of a dead man by that name (Charles not Experiment). To those of us in the audience who might be strangers in paranormal precincts it looks suspiciously like a seance. Then a second introduction follows. Some years later three college students arm themselves with an impressive battery of electronic devices (lets hope they got a discount at Best Buy) and set out to reproduce the experiment. Whats with kids these days? They should be drinking to excess or playing video games or eating sickening quantities of junk food. Any of those popular youthful activities would have a happier outcome than their efforts in the laboratory. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters What they found one of the students later explains wasnt a ghost or demon but an ""entity."" The student is played by Tom Felton best known as Draco Malfoy in the ""Harry Potter"" films. It sure seems weird to see him without white hair. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The lab sequence is full of fast-and-furious editing jittery camerawork and lots of images seen on video monitors. Everything is dark and disorienting so its impossible to see what becomes of the entity. Where did it go? Nothing is dark and disorienting about the bright sunshine of the Southern California community thats home to Kelly (Ashley Greene from the ""Twilight"" movies) and Ben (Sebastian Stan from ""Gossip Girl""). They live together in a McMansion owned by her parents who bought the place as an investment. Ah but are Kelly and Ben the only ones living there? Strange things start to happen. Furniture moves of its own accord. Locked doors somehow get open. Yucky stuff starts to grow on counters and ceilings. The clothes in Kellys walk-in closet which is roughly the size of Delaware are suddenly torn and twisted. Lights flash on and off. Could the problem be electro-magnetic in nature? There certainly seem to be a lot of high-tension lines in the town. ""Watch out for spiders"" Kelly helpfully says when Ben enters the crawl space beneath the house to investigate. When he installs a set of surveillance cameras and theyre mysteriously disabled he takes it in stride. Ben is a guy who just wont take yes for an answer. ""Houses make weird noises"" he suggests. ""Maybe some animal got inside."" Well yes depending on how similar your definitions of ""animal"" and ""entity"" are. ""The Apparition"" is utterly forgettable except for two things. Well three if youre a Red Sox fan (Kelly and Bens neighbor is the spitting image of Jason Varitek). The first thing is silly. For a brief scene the entity picks up one of the surveillance cameras and through it we get an entity-eye view of the world ghost cam The second thing is a true inspiration on the part of writer-director Todd Lincoln. ""The Apparition"" is the first Great Recession horror movie. Kelly and Ben live in a development full of other McMansions all but one of them empty. ""Our house is too new to be haunted"" Kelly complains to Ben. ""It has no history."" Having no history can be even more haunting than too much of it. The entity is a ghostly presence amid an even ghostlier absence. This is truly distressed real estate. Mark Feeney can be reached at mfeeneyglobe.com.

"The Apparition cant shake Paranormal Activity Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview The Apparition cant shake Paranormal ActivityWith The Apparition starring Ashley Greene (Twilight) comparisons to Paranormal Activity are inevitable and the comparisons arent favorable.August 25 2012|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Ashley Greene stars in ""The Apparition."" (Stefan Erhard / Warner Bros )There is something haunting ""The Apparition"" stalking its dark corners and lying in wait to make itself seen. That something would be the wildly successful ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise liberally and frequently borrowed from here as something of a default centering position.After a brief opening explaining a 1970s parapsychology experiment that seems to set it up as yet another fake-found-footage endeavor the film switches to present day and a more conventional movie style.Kelly (Ashley Greene one of those other ""Twilight"" kids) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) are a young couple setting up house in an income property recently purchased by her parents. Unbeknownst to Kelly Ben had taken part in a recent restaging of that earlier experiment and now the malevolent force he unwittingly unleashed into the world has come a-calling. As they try to deal with mysterious mold shifting furniture a closet in strange disarray and other unnerving goings-on Kelly tells Ben in an unintentional laugh line ""My parents are counting on us to look after their place. I cant tell them their house is haunted.""PHOTOS A brief history of found-footage films""The Apparition"" is set amid the exurbs of California where subdivisions and superstores fill the space between rambling undeveloped ravines. (The films interior scenes were shot on soundstages in Berlin; the exterior of its main house is in Palmdale.)"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;Writer-director Todd Lincoln in his feature debut attempts to conjure an ominous sense of the mundane from the self-same houses but much of the film ends up feeling like a series of establishing shots that never set up anything. Once the story gets inside even specific shot selections evoke the ""Paranormal"" films in particular the framing of a view down some stairs into an empty living room. The eventual revelation that its not the house thats haunted its them also feels like a retread.At one point the couple are about to get fresh with a backyard bikini-top back rub when their dog keels over. Later after a tamely obligatory shower scene Greene spends a long sequence running about the house without any pants on. Often in the film she is subdivided so that only her toned bare legs are on screen.If the films basic formula is pretty people creepy happenings a the CW meets the ""PA"" a it adds up to something lacking either body heat or visceral suspense.The ApparitionRated PG-13Running time 1 hour 22 minutesPlaying In wide releasemark.olsenlatimes.com"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAshley Greene focuses on fans amid The Twilight Saga stormAugust 3 2012New on DVDJanuary 22 2012Movie review A Warriors HeartDecember 2 2011Breaking Dawn a Part 1 review Vampire tale is lifelessNovember 18 2011Ministry of GossipSeptember 9 2011"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt;MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowFilmNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-0825-apparition-20120825,0,3313441.story",200,theapparition2,theapparition,latimes

Special to Newsday + - Aspiring veterinarian Kelly (Ashley Greene) in ""The Apparition."" Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Plot A murderous supernatural entity toys with a young couple. Rating PG-13 (terror/frightening images and some sensuality) Cast Ashley Greene Sebastian Stan Tom Felton Julianna Guill Length 122 Bottom line Adequately spooky The parched Los Angeles subdivision where aspiring veterinarian Kelly (Ashley Greene) and home-theater installer Ben (Sebastian Stan) live is ringed by desert scrub strip malls and high-tension power lines. If thats not already hell its close enough for something to have slipped through from the other side -- and now their house in that near-empty pop-up suburb suffers electrical surges moldy decay strange background voices and something making pretzels out of wooden hangers and leaving claw marks on the walls. If all that sounds like familiar paranormal activity -- or ""Paranormal Activity"" -- then this first feature by writer-director Todd Lincoln wont take you anyplace new. Certainly if youre an aficionado of Japanese horror films like the influential ""Ring"" (1998) and ""Ju-on The Grudge"" (2002) which clearly imprinted on Lincoln like they have on other filmmakers you may be downright bored. But for casual viewers desiring a few scares some suspense and a sustained sense of dread and malevolence you could do worse. advertisement | advertise on newsday The apparition in question first emerges during Bens college years when Ben girlfriend Lydia (Julianna Guill) and buddy Patrick (Tom Felton) called forth something with dire repercussions. Now Ben has moved on but Patrick is still experimenting -- and the entity has grown stronger and nastier. In the films biggest nod to Japanese horror its not the house thats haunted as per usual in Western ghost stories -- its Ben and by extension Kelly. So Running out of the house? Doesnt help so much. Not helping the movie so much is such occasionally hackneyed dialogue as ""In my own way I was trying to protect you"" and ""Were safe now."" On the plus side the camera lingers on beautiful ""Twilight"" star Greene within the confines of a PG-13 rating -- although one extended scene with her wearing only lingerie does go on long enough to become kind of funny.

Credit Stefan Erhad/Warner Brothers Pictures Property maintenance can be a pain especially when a ghost appears to be the resident super. Just ask Kelly (Ashley Greene of ""Twilight"") and Ben (Sebastian Stan of ""Gossip Girl"") the leads in ""The Apparition."" Recent college grads minding an investment home owned by Kellys parents they just want to spruce up the place a spacious desert residence but objects simply wont stay put.Lights flicker; soap and cactuses blacken; claw marks appear; icky molds gather like hornet nests. Pepper a dog comes in stares at the ceiling lies down and expires angering his owner Maggie (Anna Clark) the nice little girl next door. Soon security cameras are destroyed and Kellys clothes are tied into knots in a closet. Bloodless imagery evoking the ""Paranormal Activity"" films and the J-horror classic ""Ringu"" appears and predictably there is a shower scene.Ben it seems has been holding out on Kelly. He once worked with Patrick (Tom Felton) on school experiments opening a gateway between the afterlife and our earthly plane and now a specter has skipped across it and glommed onto the young lovebirds.""The house isnt haunted"" Patrick says. ""You are."" Patrick is eventually dragged into a dark closet while sitting on a chair. Undigested the chair flies out.At one point Ben helpfully looks under the house to see what might be causing the ruckus. ""Watch out for spiders"" Kelly says. Actually Ben -- and the filmmakers -- have a lot more to worry about.""The Apparition"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for enraging young dog owners.

Rather than rigging another charming old dark house with scares writer-director Todd Lincoln settles on a lone occupied unit in an isolated development of sluggishly selling Spanish-style stucco-and-tile jobs in an anonymous California bedroom community. ""Our house is too new to be haunted"" Ben (Sebastian Stan) reassures his girlfriend Kelly (Ashley Greene). ""It has no history."" But this doesnt prevent weird provocations by an initially prankish poltergeist whose presence Kelly eventually links to Bens covered-up paranormal investigations in the past. When found out Bens ""I can explain. . . . We were in college It was just an experiment"" is the big howler in a movie full of them and suggests a rich unpursued metaphor. Twilights Greene and low-rent Bob Pattinson Stan though used advantageously for ogling purposes are made to establish their characters by fixedly idiotically grinning at each other despite the fact that neither is saying anything even remotely amusing. Widescreen-literate Lincoln making his feature debut develops an anxious atmosphere of uncanny suburbia culminating in Kellys wandering an empty strip mall in a smoggy sunless world--but he might have consulted someone who has talked to a living human being before for help on the screenplay.Film Details The Apparition RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time82 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

At least the Paranormal Activity films enliven this conceit with formal rigor. While an eerie 1973-set prologue hints at a story The Apparition turns out to be nothing more than a series of feebly constructed ""Boo"" scenes tacked together to achieve (barely) feature length. The movie loses goodwill early on by killing an adorable dog resulting in a lack of an identification point since the canine has better intuition than the humans.

Mild scares and a go-nowhere climax haunt this suburbs-set debut. TWITTER Writer-director Todd Lincoln once in talks to remake ""The Fly"" for Fox instead makes his debut with generic poltergeist fare. Todd Lincolns suburbia-set ghost flick The Apparition which involves various fungus-like manifestations of the otherworldly is in a couple of ways like dealing with a black-mold problem You have to be a certain kind of person to get very disturbed by it and once its over youre quite likely to feel cheated. It might draw in the reliable genre audience on opening weekend but word-of-mouth wont serve it well. PHOTOS Iconic Horror Movies Stars Ashley Greene (as Kelly) and Sebastian Stan (Ben) start off on shaky ground exhibiting no chemistry as a young couple who moving into a newly built home Kellys parents own have nothing more interesting to banter about than trips to Costco. As they settle into their new digs though Lincoln finds his genre groove Some skimpy (but PG-13-friendly) nightclothes here some autonomously moving furniture there -- this new house is so evil it even kills the neighbors shaggy dog which must be particularly galling for Kelly who wants to be a vet. Eventually we learn this hauntings source Back in college Ben and his classmate Patrick (Tom Felton) did some tech-enhanced communing with the ghostly plane and opened -- wait for it -- ""a rift between our world and theirs."" Once contacted Patrick brings over all sorts of broadcasting and amplification gear convinced that playing recordings of the original experiment in reverse will send the baddies back to Purgatory. PHOTOS Europes Horror Fetish What Patricks version of Bose Ghost-Canceling technology actually does though is shut the movie down. Lincolns script has no knack for the pacing of cinematic exorcisms and the truncated climax he does offer is short on action and scares. A stylish credits sequence unspooled at the pictures end seems to have received more attention than the storys third act. Production Warner Bros.

If you listen closely enough while things go bump in the night during ""The Apparition"" you might also hear the scraping of barrel bottoms. This enervating muddle of paranormal nonsense manages the difficult feat of seeming frenzied and lethargic all at once while building toward the sort of ludicrous cop-out climax that often incites die-hard genre fans to shout rude things at the screen. Even if the late summer Warners release manages to post middling opening-weekend numbers word of mouth should be sufficiently scathing to douse long-term potential. Ancillary prospects are dim. Writer-director Todd Lincoln lays on the portentous atmosphere with a trowel and attempts to amp the suspense with an insistent techno score by the ensemble known as Tomandandy. But all that window dressing does little to generate sustained interest in a jumbled narrative that plays out as though it were improvised on a day-to-day basis during shooting. It doesnt help that lead players Ashley Greene and Sebastian Stan offer performances that seem not just muted but Quaaluded. The plot involves two attractive young lovers -- Kelly (Greene) a veterinary student and Ben (Stan) a home-entertainment tech guy -- who agree to housesit a suburban investment property owned by Kellys parents. (Exteriors were filmed in Southern California but most interiors were shot in Berlins Babelsberg Studio.) Even after they begin to hear strange noises at night and notice doors opening and furniture moving by themselves the couple stays put. (""Our house is too new to be haunted"" Ben insists when Kelly gets a teeny bit nervous. ""It has no history."") But when unsightly splotches of mold appear on walls and beneath floors and a neighbors dog just lies down and dies in their kitchen they still dont get the hint. Eventually Ben surmises that maybe all this weird stuff has something to do with a mysterious whatsit that he and his fellow students summoned a while back during a university parapsychology experiment. But the audience remains several steps -- miles really -- ahead of him. So it comes as a surprise only to Ben when somewhere around the 50-minute mark a college chum states ""Your house isnt haunted. You are."" To say there is a resolution to ""The Apparition"" would be to credit the pic with more coherence than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the payoff has something to do with a malignant spirit that can use bedsheets as lethal devices and something else to do with power-line towers that loom ominously in shots scattered throughout. (These towers teasingly hint that someone involved might have remembered ""Pulse"" Paul Goldings unjustly overlooked 1988 thriller about a killer power grid.) Shorn of its mercilessly protracted final-credits roll ""The Apparition"" clocks in at a compact 73 minutes. But really some pics can never be short enough.

Share Tweet Theres an art to making a horror movie with limited resources one that involves suggesting danger rather than showing it and building tension out of virtually nothing happening. But sometimes suggestions just hang in the air pointing nowhere and virtually nothing happening feels like just that. Just because theres an art to something doesnt make everyone who attempts it an artist. The Apparition the first feature by writer-director Todd Lincoln features a small cast and takes place largely in an empty suburban home one of the few occupied houses in a California neighborhood filled with unsold lots. Its a potentially creepy setting that would give an innovative director a chance to do a lot with a little. Unfortunately Lincoln isnt one of those. Theres little evidence of innovation in this film which opens with some eyeroll-inducing text introducing sigh found footage of a seance from 1973 before fast-forwarding to a modern attempt at the same filled with pseudoscientific jargon and equipment that looks like its on loan from Egon Spengler. Something goes wrong of course and by jumping forward a few more years the film finds one of the seance participants (Sebastian Stan) trying to run away from the horrible shadowy fleetingly glimpsed thing he and his friends have summoned. Hes starting a new life with his veterinarian-in-training girlfriend (Twilights Ashley Greene) whos moved into the aforementioned suburban home purchased by her parents as an investment property. In the first of many time-killing sequences that pad out The Apparitions 82-minute (with leisurely closing credits) running time they talk about taking a trip to Costco discuss whether or not Costco will carry the type of cactus Greene likes travel to Costco shop at Costco then return home with bags filled with Costco items including the cactus. (Oddly enough that shopping spree makes The Apparition only this summers second most Costco-obsessed film after The Watch which stopped short of featuring a scene in which cancer-stricken children were healed just by walking through the stores aisles.) Then the cactus dies making it the canary that reveals theyre living in a supernatural coal mine thats taken a turn for the toxic. When not leaning hard on ideas borrowed from the Paranormal Activity series--the doors that open on their own the surveillance-camera footage the sound design that clearly cost more than any other part of the movie--Lincoln scares up a few potent images that contrast the sterile dream-home interior with an entity that manifests itself via rot and mold. But the idea of creeping corruption proves a lot scarier than its CGI-created manifestations and some of the films other scares are just laughable. (Although viewers scared of finding their clothes tied into knots should stay far away.) Laughable too characters who seem less substantial than the ghosts who threaten them and a performance by Greene that plays like an homage to Wild Things-era Denise Richards all arched backs blank stares creepy smiles and flat line readings. Its sadly the films most unsettling element. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Premium Rush Next Movie Review The Tall Man Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.
