When he woke the next morning Northup was shackled in a dungeon a few streets from the Capitol. He had been drugged and abducted and was about to be smuggled south to be sold into slavery. Slideshow 12 Years a Slave An essential story well told at last Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about 12 Years a Slave >> When he insisted he was a free man with a wife and children back in Saratoga Springs he was beaten. And beaten again. It was the beginning of a nightmare odyssey and it is the beginning of Steve McQueens remarkable 12 Years a Slave. A tale of impossible cruelty and incredible survival this essential piece of filmmaking embodies in microcosm the long and shameful chapter of American history when men women and children because of the color of their skin were oppressed commodified abused. It speaks to the courage and resilience of one man the savagery of many and the potential for both good and for ill in us all. If thats not enough its just darn good storytelling a picture made with impeccable artistry and intelligence and with actors - Chiwetel Ejiofor foremost among them - who bring these heroes and villains innocents and malefactors to life wholly and sometimes horrifically. Michael Fassbender McQueens star in Hunger and Shame plays Edwin Epps the third of Northups owners - a bitter man who lords over his Louisiana plantation quoting scripture and whipping the slaves who do not do his bidding or do not meet the daunting quotas of cotton they must pick. It is shocking to think that apart from a handful of blaxploitation titles - and Quentin Tarantinos jokey off-key take on that genre Django Unchained - the subject of slavery from the perspective of the enslaved has never really been addressed on-screen before. McQueen the black British director remedies this failing fearlessly. Adapting Northups 1853 memoir McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley take the viewer down a surreal rabbit hole into a world of injustice where the established social order is completely out of whack - and nobody except the human chattel seems to notice. Ejiofor who played the Royal Navy interpreter in Steven Spielbergs slave mutiny film Amistad (that legal case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1841 the same year Northup was kidnapped) gives body and soul to his role in 12 Years a Slave. Beaming great pride and dignity as the story begins Northup is beaten down - and in one gut-turning scene strung up in a noose left to hang. As he goes from disbelief and outrage to resignation and regret - from a determination to win freedom to merely a determination to survive - the change in Northup whose slave name is Platt is palpable. The supporting roles from the mercenary trader played by Paul Giamatti to the morally compromised plantation owner played by Benedict Cumberbatch to Lupita Nyongos slave girl (the object of Epps admiration) to Paul Danos bullying small-minded overseer are all top tier memorable. Brad Pitt wearing an Amish-style beard is Samuel Bass a carpenter from Canada who comes to work on the Epps plantation - sharing the screen with Ejiofor and then Fassbender. Pitt delivers the movies most transparently reflective dialogue - Bass is the movies conscience our collective conscience - and he does so while hammering nails and raising beams with a down-home grace and gravity. McQueen using a clanging score by Hans Zimmer interwoven with fiddle jigs and spirituals favors long takes surveying the landscape the faces the bodies doing hard labor in the Southern heat. There are images that have the formal composition of old daguerreotypes. And the period details the clothes the houses ring with authenticity. At the same time as we follow Solomon Northup on his harrowing journey it all feels immediate urgent. ""Your story it is amazing"" Bass says to Northup ""and in no good way."" 12 Years a Slave is history but it resonates in profound ways in the here and now. sreaphillynews.com 215-854-5629 Steven_Rea www.inquirer.com/onmovies More Coverage The Counselor is a high-end baffler Oct 24 - 243 PM 12 Years a Slave An essential story well told at last Oct 24 - 243 PM The Counselor is a high-end baffler Oct 24 - 243 PM Published October 25 2013 -- 301 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in entertainment Steven Rea > Philly director from NoLibs making waves in Hollywood Celebrities amp; Gossip > Clintons party at Kimmel Center post-acceptance speech Entertainment > Longwood Gardens beloved trippy Nightscape returns Austin folkie Sarah Jarosz goes to the head of her class with album tour Folk music is a rich fine palate for Sarah Jarosz the classically trained but rustic singer/songwriter coming to Ardmore Music Hall Sunday...

But like Quentin Tarantino before him British artist turned director Steve McQueen knows that this idea offers only false comfort 12 Years a Slave has absolutely no interest in reconciliation in forgiveness in making slavery history. McQueens film may be stylistically traditional but its outlook is as confrontational and uncompromising as any ripped-from-the-headlines drama.Chiwetel Ejiofor is terse watchful and remote as Solomon Northup the free New Yorker torn from his family and sold into slavery in the South. We follow his journey from plantation to plantation under masters both self-congratulatingly benevolent (Benedict Cumberbatch) and wildly unremittingly brutal (Michael Fassbender). As expected from the director of Hunger and Shame this is not a sprawling Spielbergian tearjerker but neither is it an aloof artsy affair. McQueen pitches his tent somewhere between the two camps whenever Hans Zimmers overbearing score threatens to drag the film into three-hankie territory the clinical photography and hard unflashy performances bring it right back. Its a film made for a mass audience but it doesnt want them to feel comfortable for a second.What 12 Years a Slave is really interested in is creating an honest believable experience in culture and context place and people soil and skin. The result can at times be alienating - Solomon may be a tragic achingly sympathetic figure but hes no cathartic hero no Django. He is at all times a victim. Nonetheless the cumulative emotional effect is devastating the final scenes here are as angry as memorable as overwhelming as anything modern cinema has to offer.

McQeen has allowed space for the dreadfulness of the place to speak. Fellow slaves carry on whilst awful things happen ""as though nothing was happening"". You see Solomons face almost filling the screen. There is no hurry as the weight of his plight confronts you the helpless onlooker. But we know it is a story and he must survive. But others dont. The word slavery is not often applied to modern behaviour but we know it goes on. Someone imagining they can own someone else and doing just what they like with that fellow human. This film does stand up for those victims. It shows how demeaning just such cruelty can leave us humans. Everyone over 15 should see this film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 23 20141 of 1 found helpfuldragonflyFeaturedan exceptional film  brutally honest beautifully acted and directed .

This film is incredibly bold and brave - how often do you get a director taking on Hollywood and America telling the story they didnt dare to tell. The first shock is that these horrible things happened to thousands of Black Americans ancestors. The second shock is why these stories have not previously come through the system. It is rare to grab an audience from the start bring tears disgust anger and many other emotions out and to leave us with images that are unforgettable. The fact that McQueen is British and happens to be of black origin telling this American story after Shame makes it all the more compelling.

Want to know how and why slavery burnt and twisted its way into the psyche of millions of white and black people alike? Want to discover why blacks struggle to just get over it? Go and see this film. As horrific as some of the scenes are there is plenty of evidence from the historical record that much worse occured not just in America but across the Caribbean where the forebears of many our Black British citizens were slaves. Some cant believe men were kidnapped in the way depicted but again there a mass of evidence to support it (the transatlantic slave trade was outlawed in 1808 so kidnappers flourished in its aftermath).

I went to see American Hustle the previous week and it felt a lot longer than this although they have a similar running time. 12 Years A Slave should win the Oscar for best actor director amp; picture (if not more). I honestly think it may be the best film of the year come December.

Yes it did at times feel sanitised and pulled too many punches given how much worse the story really was. That said its a didactic film for people who dont know too much about the Deep South and like their lessons in nice packaging. Good news is that it feels a lot shorter than Wolf of Wall Street.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 17 2014villardiFeaturedNot perfect by any means but always compelling and frequently harrowing and moving. Episodic in nature and lacking continuity at times but knowing this story is basically truthful and these events happened less than 200 years ago. Very brave for an English director to take on Americas racist past but I doubt the Academy will have the guts to give it the Oscar for best film.

In my mind it is just about a 4 star film maybe 7.5 out of 10. Apart from Fassbender and Nyongo there are no stand out performances and Zimmers score goes beyond over bearing to at times a cliche drowning out everything else at times. The film almost cudgels you over the head with its message. A good film at times very good just ever really great. Worth a view but not the revelation the tv ads and reviews would make you believe.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 10 2014ArchgateFeaturedDespite an antiseptic feel and unconvincing performances from Fassbender and Cumberbatch this is an unflinching insight into one mans misery.

By Dana Stevens Lupita NyongO and Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years a Slave. Photo courtesy Francois Duhamel/Fox Searchlight After youve seen 12 Years a Slave come back and listen to Slates Spoiler Special with Dana Stevens Aisha Harris and Forrest Wickman. You can also download the podcast here. Advertisement There are movies to which the critical response lags far behind the emotional one. Two days after seeing 12 Years a Slave British director Steve McQueens adaptation of the 1853 memoir of a free black man kidnapped into slavery Im still awaiting delivery of the apparatus that would permit me to analyze it. So overpowering is this films simple horrible and almost entirely true story--and so impressive the feats of acting cinematography historical research and set and costume design that conspire to bring that story to us--that its hard to get enough distance on 12 Years a Slave to poke at its inner workings. I want to try though--if only because its that tendency to overwhelm the viewer that strikes me as this generally stunning movies chief flaw. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. One of the first observations to make about 12 Years a Slave is that its lushly paradoxically gorgeous a beautiful film about the ugliest of subjects. McQueen got his start as an experimental video artist and his compositions and lighting choices are often exquisitely painterly. He loves to use the contemplative insert shots--often focusing on a detail from nature--known as ""pillow shots"" cypress trees reflected in peach-colored bayous at sunset caterpillars crawling over cotton bolls. The early scenes in which Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is still a free and relatively prosperous man living with his wife and two children in Saratoga Springs N.Y. unfold in an almost gauzy glow of memory (framed by an opening scene of Solomon now renamed ""Platt"" as he works in a field of sugarcane). After Solomon a part-time violinist is promised a lucrative gig by two white men who run a kind of traveling circus hes drugged and wakes up in a brick cell in shackles. Along with some other captured blacks--some free some not--Solomon is transported by boat to the South where hes sold to a series of increasingly bad masters. First comes William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) a pious well-meaning hypocrite who sees no contradiction between preaching Scripture to his slaves on Sunday and forever separating a mother (Adepero Oduye) from her children. That separation happens in a starkly staged rigorously unsentimentalized auction scene thats one of the films hardest to watch and to forget. One of Fords petty overseers the loathsome Tibeats (Paul Dano taking a little too much pleasure in his own villainy) takes a particular dislike to the initially defiant Solomon and goads him into a fight that will result not only in Solomons near-fatal torture but his sale to the cotton farmer Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Advertisement If Solomon is the films moral center Epps is its moral black hole an alcoholic psycho who sometimes forces his exhausted slaves to dance for him into the wee hours of the morning. (Grand Guignol as it sounds this horrific detail is true to Northups narrative.) And thats one of the nicer things he does In darker moods Epps is prone to chasing the people he calls ""my property"" around the pigsty with a knife or whipping them till the flesh flies off their backs. His sexual obsession with his beautiful young slave Patsey (the astonishing Lupita Nyongo) means that she is subject both to near-nightly rape and to random abuse from Epps jealous neglected wife (an excellent Sarah Paulson). The long stretch of the film that takes place at Epps plantation contains the best examples both of McQueens artistry and his occasional tendency to gild the lily. In this section he explores with remarkable attention to behavioral nuance a rich array of social relationships governed by the institution of slavery--not just master and slave but mistress and slave shopkeeper and slave and most of all slave and slave. The well-kept mistress of a neighboring plantation owner (Alfre Woodard) tries to convince Patsey that life as a sexual prisoner has its comparative advantages ignoring the fact that Patseys owner both rapes her and makes her work harder than any man in the cotton fields. Later Patsey and Solomon become close allies after she begs him to put an end to her misery by killing her in a scene thats as painful as it is sublimely acted. McQueen is particularly adept at exploring the intense yet guarded nature of relationships among the slaves for whom friendship--not to speak of love--is a dangerous and necessarily transitory proposition. But in a climactic set piece in which Solomon is forced by a gun-wielding Epps to whip Patsey nearly to death I sometimes felt smothered by McQueens insistence on wallowing in the extremes of human anguish. McQueen has been accused in the past of aestheticizing suffering a critique which seems fairer to make of his two previous features (Hunger and Shame) than of this one. Hunger in which Michael Fassbender starves himself before our eyes as the Irish hunger striker Bobby Sands and Shame in which Fassbender plays a man sinking into a swamp of sex addiction both struck me as movies with unpleasantly sadistic relationships to their audience Lets see how much human suffering and moral degradation you can take. When the subject matter is a historical horror on the order of slavery McQueens miserablist approach would seem to make a kind of sense--but you could also argue that Solomons dehumanizing ordeal is powerful enough in itself to need minimal directorial underlining. And though Fassbender is electrifying as Epps--he gives a broad kinetic constantly menacing performance that strikes sparks off Ejiofors quieter steadier one--theres sometimes a sense that the script (by John Ridley) uses the character as an all-purpose scare machine the red-bearded equivalent of the shark in Jaws. I was terrified of Epps but Im not sure I left the movie with any sense of who he was other than the most nightmarish master imaginable. Maybe thats all we needed to know. None of these quibbles matters though by the time you get to the soul-rending last scene of 12 Years a Slave when a stunned Solomon at last comes home to his wife and now-grown children after more than a decade of hard labor and isolation so damaged by the years hes lost he seems scarcely able to remember what bodily autonomy feels like. Its the unhappiest happy ending Ive ever seen a moment that makes you weep not just for this one man who found his way back to freedom but for all those men and women who never knew it in the first place.

Every scene of 12 Years a Slave and almost every shot conveys some penetrating truth about Americas original sin.Yes its the best movie ever made about American slavery but thats not really saying much. 12 Years triumph is in constantly capturing complex emotions and thoughts through visual means.Thats what great movies do and here those thoughts and emotions happen to carry massive historical freight tied to a subject Hollywood has never really known how to approach.By now you likely know the basics. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup on whose memoir the film is based. One moment Northup is a free man in Saratoga N.Y. enjoying the company of his wife and kids. The next hes been flattered and lured to Washington D.C. and plied with drink. He wakes up in a dungeon streaked with chiaroscuro light where his odyssey into hell begins.The director Steve McQueen and the screenwriter John Ridley dont care much for generalities. Theyre after acute psychological physical and historical detail. 12 Years a Slave is a movie of blood and bone of sweat and shame. Its a movie of flesh poked prodded slapped and whipped. Its also a movie of paradoxical beauty with the weeping willows and painted skies of Louisiana mocking the human torment that permeates the story.The films greatest special effect is Ejiofors face particularly his eyes. They plead and reproach and they ask a question What manner of rabbit hole have I tumbled into? Ejiofor conveys the shock of swift sudden bondage. 12 Years is the opposite of an escape narrative. Its about refusing to accept unimaginable captivity with no end in sight.Each of Solomons masters represents a defining deformity of the Peculiar Institution a common euphemism of the day. The first Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) oozes pious paternalism and also debt; the bleeding and scarred economic foundation of the South has not treated him well.Ford sells Solomon to Epps a sadist made all the scarier by the intelligence of the actor playing him Michael Fassbender. Epps uses the Bible to justify slavery. Hes also in quiet angry love with his most prolific cotton picker Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) a fact he cant accept. How can he have feelings for a being hes been taught to see as subhuman?McQueens gift for seeing and using the entire frame comes in handy here. 12 Years has an unblinking quality; it demands that you look and look carefully at this subject the movies have so often swept under a cover of cheap sentimentality. He has no use for rapid cutting or any other tricks of the trade that might detract from the integrity of the images.12 Years a Slave is historically important because its exquisitely made. Even the most vital subject the most radical filmmaking proposal can be botched in the execution. McQueens first two films Hunger and Shame had already established him as a formidable talent. 12 Years which looks so clearly at a nearly taboo subject is ironically his most accessible movie to date. Its also his best.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.12 YEARS A SLAVEA Directed by Steve McQueen. R (violence/cruelty nudity brief sexuality). 133 mins.

"The Song of Solomon << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Home Cooking  Next Jerrys Broken Toy Fox Searchlight Facebook Twitter Print The Song of Solomon The cultural crater of 12 Years a Slave by Wesley Morris on October 24 2013 It is a grim sight the man hanging from a tree. His neck is noosed. His arms are tied behind him. The toes of two booted feet tap tap tap in the mud neither foot firmly on the earth. Each skates a bit. But all that planting the entire foot guarantees is more drudgery. He continues to tap and struggle just the same -- for hours and possibly days. The cicadas keep changing their tune. From a distance we watch him. And from a distance he is watched. Men and women leave their shacks and go about their duties as if the hanging man were a natural botanical product. They know him and they know better than to help. He was bad insurgently so. Now he hangs as an advertisement against insurrection. From a different angle a finely dressed woman watches the man briefly from her balcony turns around and heads inside. Children are playing. From the left a woman less finely dressed sneaks him something to drink and you feel the risk. She bets her safety to water this strange piece of fruit. Ive never seen a sequence that so elegantly uses duration to lay out an ecosystem of power and powerlessness one that ripples across time from the 1840s to the 21st century. 12 Years a Slave manages to do that again and again. It coolly clarifies the United States lasting social underpinnings the seeds of black anger black self-doubt black resilience white supremacy and white guilt. The director is Steve McQueen a 44-year-old Englishman. The screenwriter is the American entertainment-industry veteran John Ridley. Both men are black and the movie theyve made radically shifts the perspective of the American racial historical drama from the allegorical uplift to the explanatory wallop. The hanging man is Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a violinist carpenter husband and father whose 1853 memoir gives the movie its source material. Northup was born a free black man and a series of non-chronological flashbacks show that he enjoyed his middle-class life in Saratoga Springs New York. His wife and children leave for a three-week trip and to pass some of the time he accepts an invitation to accompany two performers (Scoot McNairy Taran Killam) to Washington D.C. He awakens in a cell chained to a wall and accused of being a runaway from Georgia. His back is beaten with a board until the board breaks. Then hes whipped. In one of the flashbacks a slave notices the Northup family walking into a shop and wanders astonished from his owner to gape at these unicorns. Now that mans disbelief is Solomons. The entire film presents savagery in civil terms. Paul Giamatti plays a slave trader who informs Solomon with a slap that his name is to be Platt. He goes on to sell a mother named Eliza (Adepero Oduye) to a New Orleans plantation owner named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). He does so as she pleads not to be sold separately from two children. The pulse of Giamattis character never seems to go up. He kicks one child and makes the other demonstrate for Ford how ""its very like he will grow into a fine beast"" while their mother is dragged from the room. Whether hes heartless by nature or circumstance is unclear. A well-appointed house doubles as his market with men and women arranged for sale along the walls and Solomon playing his violin. You tend to see scenes like this in public as tragic commercial theater. Domesticating it as this movie does compounds the awfulness. Ford takes Solomon too (the violin seems to impress him) and after Solomon beats a dim bullying overseer (Paul Dano) and the overseer attempts to hang him Ford cuts him down and ships him off to another less benevolent owner named Epps (Michael Fassbender). On the Epps plantation the burden of civility rests upon the shoulders of the slaves. Epps is a lunatic and his wife Mary (Sarah Paulson) is crazed with jealousy. With his red beard drunken sexual appetite and wretched insecurity Master Epps chases demeans and insults the men and women he calls his property. When Epps greets a group of his slaves he adds a shocking grace note to his welcome. He plants his arm on the head of a boy and leans. You cant take your eyes off the child. He doesnt move. He cant. Thats not what furniture does. This isnt a psychological movie but the roots of so much national pathology are here the belittling of black men by whites and by themselves the nations ongoing discomfort with true equality and its easing fear of interracial desire. The object of Eppss lust is a petite field worker named Patsey (Lupita Nyongo). Patsey has a striking specifically African beauty (in some shots Nyongos skin is almost ebony). You notice her as Epps has. He singles her out for her cotton-picking prowess and marks her as his extramarital favorite. She so hates the arrangement that she begs Solomon to end her life. He cant. Nyongo spends the movie acting at a slow boil. Its Eppss reaction to a bar of soap that shatters the docility of her quiet performance. The central dramatic question ought to be how Solomon will get back to his former life. Another movie might have kept track of time. McQueen lets the years simply accrue. Solomon doesnt know whether hell be freed. His attempts to make contact with the North are thwarted. Either his fruity ink is too weak (even in the 1840s blackberries are a vexing communication idea) or his messenger too unreliable. He just toils away in his allotted hell. When a woman rolls over and puts his hand between her legs he abides. When one Sunday Solomon fetches Patsey from a neighboring plantation and the woman of the house Mistress Shaw (Alfre Woodard) explains to her guests her strategy for survival he simply listens. Woodard invests that monologue with all her flighty baroquely accented authority. Its an exquisite piece of writing that acknowledges the cunning and self-delusion some slaves could deploy to make the best of a terrible situation. Ridley typed it up. Woodard turns it into cursive. Some women used their sexuality. Solomon uses his violin. The notion of circumstance comes up once or twice in the film and it haunts everything. Solomon believes that Ford will show him compassion because he can appreciate that theyre equals. After Ford gets him down from that tree Solomon begs for mercy. He tells his master that hes a free man. But Eliza has already warned him that any appeal to Fords humanity would be for naught. Theyre businessmen; compassion has its limits. Ford cuts him down yes. But he also leaves him bound and lying on his side. ""Youre an exceptional nigger Platt but I fear no good will come of it."" There are few exceptions here. When a down-on-his-luck former overseer named Armsby (Garret Dillahunt) joins the field crew on the Epps plantation he picks far less cotton than Patsey. But Epps doesnt have him whipped as he does the blacks. If anyones exceptional here its Armsby. The indictment of the racial power dynamic in that cotton bale-weighing scene might as well be an indictment of the same dynamic in the movies. 12 Years a Slave is an easy landmark. Its a rare sugarless movie about racial inequality. McQueen doesnt even give you any orchestral elevation. The score is hard and churning and sparingly used. The movie is about Northup and at several points an audience is free to remember that most movies about the Civil War and slavery have been appeals to our higher nobler selves. Theyve been appeals to white audiences by white characters talking to other white characters about the inherent injustice of oppressing black people at any moment in this planets history. This is how we get movies in which white lawyers defend innocent black men (To Kill a Mockingbird A Time to Kill). Its how we get romances -- Jezebel Gone With the Wind Cold Mountain -- that use the antebellum South and Civil War as backdrops but feature either the most entertaining black slaves or almost no slaves at all. Its how you get Mississippi Burning a thriller about three murdered civil-rights activists in which even the one-dimensional racists have bigger speaking parts than any black person. Its how you get Cry Freedom a thriller about Steve Biko (Denzel Washington) that mostly locks Biko into flashbacks while a white journalist (Kevin Kline) tries to flee apartheid-era South Africa; a movie about the death of Medgar Evers thats focused on his assassin; Steven Spielberg legislative historical dramas about white men fighting over who owns black people and what it means to do so. Its how you spend 35 minutes hearing Christoph Waltz talk and talk in Django Unchained and get nervous that Quentin Tarantino momentarily forgot what his movie was called. The quality of these films is not the issue. A few of them are great. But after decades and decades and dozens of titles you get the political point. Movies1 are the most powerful ways Hollywood has to say its sorry. There is a kind of audacity in something like Lincoln in which important white men get discursive about the moral quandary in which slavery mires the country. That debate required men to search their souls and vote accordingly. But after enough of these movies youre just hot with insult. You have to stop accepting apologies accepting say The Help and start demanding correctives films that dont glorify whiteness and pity blackness movies -- serious ones -- that avoid leading an audience to believe that black stories are nothing without a white voice to tell them that black people cant live without the aid of white ones. McQueen and Ridley turn that dynamic inside out. Their movie presents the privilege of whiteness the systematic abuse of its powers and black peoples struggles to get out from beneath it. A different movie might have taken this story and turned it into a battle between Epps and the white men who feel a duty to free Northrup. Thats what were used to. There have been complaints that the movie is too violent that it depicts too many lashings too many cruelties too much interracial abuse that all the gashes on all the backs (what Toni Morrison poetically described as chokecherry trees) are just too much. But thats a privileged concern. Jonathan Demme tried to alter the imbalance with a film of Morrisons Beloved. Its a frustrating yet deeply moving (and now cautionary) attempt to bring art history and politics into the same Hollywood space. Demme damn near burned the house down. There are easier Morrison books to film. But that one might have been the most necessary. For as much as the movies have elided blacks from the center of their narratives it has also padded a cozy nest for white audiences. Racists have tended to be vanquished by white heroes so that a black audience could feel a kind of gratitude. That was the alternate kick of blaxploitation It redrew the lines of hero worship. Black audiences could cheer for themselves. The 1970s were a bonanza for predominantly black movies. Playing Harriet Tubman Jane Pittman the mother in Sounder and Binta in Roots made a saint of Cicely Tyson. That era didnt last. In the 1980s black culture accelerated its permanent crossover into mainstream America but the movies are still figuring out what beyond comedies and action movies that means. When it comes to race Hollywood tells stories from the past or relies on ancient formulas because the familiar is easier to parse. The future? It tends to look a lot like After Earth. McQueen was actually an ideal transitional filmmaker. Hes a visual artist who had made some short films of varying strength and seemed to be looking for a way to make longer movies. His first two films -- 2008s Hunger about the starvation campaign of the imprisoned IRA volunteer Bobby Sands and 2011s Shame about a sex addict in Manhattan -- were built around white men both played by Fassbender. What you saw in them was a visual artist doing some thematic exploration of behavioral extremity. You dont watch either movie thinking McQueen had lost anything in changing mediums -- well except with Shame perhaps his mind. There the trouble was that all McQueen wanted to do was provoke. Watching Fassbender spiral out of control was the moviegoing equivalent of a small dog humping your leg. It was impossible not to worry that 12 Years a Slave would just be more humping. But here McQueen practices a kind of patience and restraint. Ridleys screenplay pushes him away from sensationalism. The film is full of wide shots watchful handheld camerawork by Sean Bobbitt who also shot Hunger and Shame and striking visual flourishes. The camera for instance hovers above a wagon so that when the tarp is rolled back on the men and women curled in the wagon bed the effect is akin to the opening of a tin of sardines. McQueen isnt the first black director to do a slavery movie. Hes not even the first one to make this one. Gordon Parks actually made Solomon Northups Odyssey an earnest sanitized 1984 PBS American Playhouse production that I saw in elementary school about a dozen times when it was renamed Half Slave Half Free. Haile Gerimas didactic highly mystical Sankofa about a fashion model transformed back in time to an American plantation made film-festival ripples in 1993. And Gilbert Moses directed a quarter of ABCs Roots the cultural event of 1977. McQueens film doesnt have that shows scope (Roots was broadcast on eight consecutive nights in a bygone era of monoculture) its retroactive camp or its urgent need for racial reconciliation. The power of McQueens movie is in its declaratory style This happened. That is all and that is everything. No performance is bigger than it needs to be except perhaps that of Fassbender who plays a dangerously silly man as though he were a dingo. McQueen has the character drunk on power which allows Fassbender to cut a figure of flamboyance a man who loves performing ownership. Other actors come and go -- Woodard Quvenzhane Wallis Chris Chalk Michael Kenneth Williams Brad Pitt -- but its Ejiofors stoicism that stays with you. In other movies he has managed to act past ridiculousness (he originated the drag queen in the movie that became the musical Kinky Boots) or rivet you with righteousness. Here Ejiofor has the challenge of being solemn without seeming passive. His isnt that dignified detachment that some actors have to go for with a film like this. He doesnt have to be a non-human deity. (That was some of the trouble with the Jackie Robinson we got in 42.) Ejiofor has a leading mans carriage. He moves from scene to scene in a state of forlorn rumination. After the opening minutes McQueen doesnt waste time with flashbacks. He doesnt need to. The movies right there in that woebegone face. When the film ended I just sat in my seat. I didnt know where to go. I didnt want to go anywhere. This isnt a post-screening lobby film. You dont quite mill about after. What could anybody possibly say? In part that sense of speechlessness is a response to the films muted artistry. In part its a response to the movies transparency. For instance you sometimes think the n-word has lost its power to appall and yet every time it is used in 12 Years a Slave -- as an appellation a title or a matter of fact -- it hurts. You hear the casual but hateful way in which Giamatti says it and you wonder about the discomfort it must have caused him as an actor or how Dano must have felt singing a whole bone-chilling ditty that uses the word over and over. Modern attempts to deaden its power by reclaiming it for casual overuse have not worked. The racist deployment of the n-word here only makes it more depressing outside the theater to hear two friends use any variation of it on each other or to listen to a 43-year-old superstar rapper use it nine times in a three-minute song about a white fashion designer. Hearing Woodards character address Solomon as N--- Platt doesnt lessen the toxicity of the slur. It doubles it. The film even permits you to see from 1841 all the way to the last couple months. What it costs to entertain is a central concern of this movie Early on we see how much Solomon enjoys performing for appreciative predominately white audiences. But over the course of the film he goes from accompanist to accomplice from pride to disgust providing musical accompaniment for atrocities like the impromptu dances that Mr. and Mrs. Epps like so much. One night Epps blows into the slaves quarters and rouses them awake. He shepherds them to the big house and commands them to dance in their nightgowns. Its such sad uninspired dancing that you dont know what pleasure either of the Eppses could take from it beyond the perverse power to demand they dance at all. Mainly Mrs. Epps sees the evening as an occasion to chuck a whiskey decanter at Patseys head. I watched the joyless look on all those black faces and the amusement on the faces of their white owners and I thought about last August 25. I thought of the handful of black burlesque dancers who jiggled and bounced in animal costumes for Miley Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards. Cyrus couldnt have known the uncomfortable history she had reached into what it means for black people to perform this sexually this anonymously for a white woman but there she was traipsing like Mrs. Epps among her fine beasts performing an otherwise good song whose title normally refers to a nonstop party but also encompasses a depressing legacy of ownership ""We Cant Stop."" Not long after Cyrus and her circus left the stage Kanye West appeared. West is no stranger to concert circuses. But on this night he arrived alone to perform a dismaying breakup song called ""Blood on the Leaves."" It warps a sample of Nina Simones version of the lynching ballad ""Strange Fruit"" while West obliquely sing-raps about an abortion. As West begins the first verse Simone says ""Black bodies swinging in the summer breeze"" and the word ""breeze"" bleats like an alarm. During the VMAs the way West was photographed at the performances start -- in a tight close-up his face to the right of the frame -- doesnt prepare you for where it went once the songs stuttering-brass beat joins him. He leaped to another part of the stage and did a flailing dance. He was not a man. He was a silhouette enshrouded in literal blackness. His proportions grew and shrank as he jumped around in the dark like a shadow puppet. West had negated himself but he wasnt alone. He danced in front of an enormous light box that contained a large weeping tree. It was a piece McQueen made using a photograph of a New Orleans lynching gallows. And at various moments West got just close enough to be proportionate to its branches. ""We coulda been somebody"" West screamed placing an emphasis on ""body"" as though the word made him sick. If West knew about McQueen he also probably knew about the work of artist Kara Walker whose depictions of the antebellum South feature craft silhouettes doing vulgar and violent things. For most of the year Walker had a ferocious show up in Wests hometown at the Art Institute of Chicago called Rise Up Ye Mighty Race which imagined a slave rebellion and was populated by her enormous stenciled silhouettes. It was more Django Unchained (crazed confrontational incendiary) than it was McQueens movie. West had managed to conflate both artists with his own art while offering an incidental rebuke of the fiasco that had preceded him in the awards show. He has a messy genius. Sometimes I dont think he knows where hes going with it. But sitting there paralyzed after 12 Years a Slave allowed me to appreciate anew Wests loaded taunting evocation of the past and how surreally far from it weve come. Men died on a tree that West was flirting with. McQueens movie refuses to let us forget that. This column has been updated to correct the release year of Shame; it was 2011 not 2012. And awards.

(AP Photo/Fox Searchlight Jaap Buitendijk) Photo Jaap Buitendijk Associated Press 12 Years a Slave review view of a horror 1 / 6 Back to Gallery 12 Years a Slave Drama. Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender. Directed by Steve McQueen. (R. 134 minutes.) ""12 Years a Slave"" has some of the awkwardness and inauthenticity of a foreign-made film about the United States. The dialogue of the Washington D.C. slave traders sounds as if it were written for ""Lord of the Rings."" White plantation workers speak in standard redneck cliches. And yet the ways in which this film is true are much more important than the ways its false. Indeed its embarrassing for America that a British director Steve McQueen (""Shame"") should have had to make this film at all and that in 2013 it should constitute a breakthrough in cinema for American slavery to be depicted as something entirely evil. Hollywood movies may have come a long way since the days of Uncle Remus and of Mammy in ""Gone With the Wind"" but the tacit gentlemens agreement not to press the issue - not to go too far in rubbing the Souths face in it - has kept Hollywood reticent up to the present much more reticent say than Germany has been about its Nazi past. ""12 Years a Slave"" is anything but reticent. It is brutal at times too brutal and though the title of the movie lets you know the horror ultimately ends for one man the viewer cannot for a minute think of that as a happy ending. We are simply too aware - we are made aware and in ways that we can never forget - of the suffering that never ended of the abuses never redressed and of the anonymous lives that were rendered hopeless for generation upon generation. McQueen is particularly good at penetrating the specific perniciousness of Southern slavery. In pagan times for example if you became a slave it was your bad luck - no slaveholder needed to pretend his slaves were less than human in order to justify keeping them. But in the American Souths gruesome costume drama nouveaux aristocrats aped the appearance of European royalty and pretended to themselves and the world that they were Christians. The result of this pretense was a perversion of self that bred sadism and decadence. McQueen descends into this maelstrom to tell the true story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a free black man who was drugged kidnapped and sold into slavery. And so with the sensibility of a modern and refined man Solomon enters the misery already in progress - the rapes the beatings the whippings the murders the vicious-imbecile overseers and the hoopskirted belles who watch from the porch. He has one master (Benedict Cumberbatch) who in another culture might have been a kind man but now is merely weak. Then he has another played by Michael Fassbender in a portrait of a man so sexually and ideologically twisted and so pleased with himself that he calls to mind Ralph Fiennes death-camp commandant in ""Schindlers List."" Chamber of horrors Such a chamber of horrors would be better suited to the sensibility of an Edgar Allan Poe than most Hollywood filmmakers. You have to have a penchant for that kind of descent which is where ""12 Years a Slave"" becomes at times frustrating and contradictory. When this movie violates its own case and crosses into the Grand Guignol - for example the close-ups of the skin flying off a womans back as shes whipped - the excess feels much more egregious than if a bad movie did the same. Its not that the subject doesnt require it but that the violence becomes voluptuous not Spartan as though the filmmaker fell in love with his films perverse aesthetic. Yet these moments are more than balanced by scenes of genuine originality horror and truth as when we see images of naked slaves on display in a genteel parlor or most unforgettably become witnesses to the nighttime entertainments of the mad slave owner (Fassbender) who insists that his slaves dance for him. In such moments Fassbender - and McQueen - capture the specific flavor of a complex psychopath who has just enough feeling left to drive him to further elaborations of creative violence. When ""12 Years a Slave"" suggests the depths of such spiritual and pragmatic cruelty it provokes recognition in us of the very heart of darkness. It makes the unimaginable imaginable. Sarah Paulson as the slaveholders wife makes clear an evil womans psychological sleight of hand She hides her wickedness to herself by imagining herself injured by her husbands lust for a young slave. As Patsey the poor young woman who has the misfortune of being her sick masters favorite Lupita Nyongo embodies with unforgettable force the agonies of body and soul. Brad Pitt who is also one of the films producers shows up in a small but crucial role that reminds us that he is the worst and best actor in movies. His accent is weird and you dont believe him in the role for a second and yet when hes onscreen its great to see him and theres no desire to look at anyone else. Face conveys meaning Finally theres Ejiofor who is magnificent playing a man trying to maintain his dignity while hiding his intelligence. His face is the audiences locus of meaning - the way he looks at the monsters surrounding him is the way we feel. He is never better than in a long close-up at a funeral in which Solomon is revived in his will to live by joining in a Negro spiritual. There he stands in an upside-down world in which villains go unpunished. He has friends who disappear - he never knows what became of them and so we never know - their torment lost in the darkness of time along with those of millions. For Solomon and for McQueen the music is all thats left of them the collective soul that cant be killed. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

February 26 2014 -- 1058am Video (5833)  Movies this week feature a free black man kidnapped and sold in the south a Las Vegas bachelors party and an attack by alien invaders. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert ""Lincoln"" through its civics-lesson nobility and ""Django Unchained"" through its giddy violence made feel-good entertainment from one of the ultimate feel-bad experiences of U.S. history. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a stinging corrective a film about plantation slavery as seen from inside the cage. It is not a rousing story of rebellion against bondage but a somber account of enduring it. The film is both brutal to watch and stunning to contemplate powerfully challenging audiences -- particularly white audiences -- to examine their consciences. English director Steve McQueen who began as a visual artist insists that we see the effects of whips on flesh and nooses on necks in unblinking detail. He straightforwardly portrays the horror of slave life never soft-pedaling the revulsion and estrangement that audiences of any color may feel confronting it. We are accustomed to movies that use violence to arouse us but not to rebuke us. What McQueen presents here head-on is a historical obscenity. America permitted -- accepted -- the buying and selling of human beings for 246 years. The fact that so few films have confronted it is also an obscenity. The film takes its story from the memoir of Solomon Northup a literate free black family man carpenter and violinist. In 1841 he was lured from his home in Upstate New York drugged stripped of his identity and sold as a laborer in Louisiana. From the moment Northup awakes to find himself a chained captive in a white mans slave pen he is in an unending nightmare. McQueens subject matter is heartbreaking but his approach is austere. John Ridleys script captures the poetic formal diction of 19th-century speech and song but it features vast stretches of silence. Most of the films scenes are constructed around a single indelible image. Fox Searchlight Lupita Nyongo Indelible and bruising. Northup is beaten across the back with 15 cruel strokes of a wooden bat by his captors. The camera alternates between shots of Northups agonized expression and his assailants sadistic scowl. On the last stroke the bat finally breaks and so does something inside Northup. From that moment on his struggle is not for freedom primarily but for survival and sanity. One of the films few special-effects shots shows the city where he is entrapped Washington D.C. the Capitol visible in the background. He is transported to the New Orleans slave markets on a riverboat. All we see of the craft is its paddle wheel churning the water like some infernal meat grinder. Paul Giamatti plays the slave trader who sells his new lot of humans as if it were a mundane business. Only Northup is shocked and amazed by it. Chiwetel Ejiofor makes Northup a man richly layered with pride and hurt now furious now resigned and frightened now beseeching. A good actor can make a wronged character sympathetic. Struggling against despair shedding his old identity to survive Ejiofor inhabits the role so fully he becomes tragic. The film is rife with villains dupes and heroic characters but it insists on the human ambiguity of each one. Master Ford Northups first owner played by Benedict Cumberbatch is a cultured pious-hearted Christian. He holds soothing Sunday gospel readings with his family and slaves mingled side by side. He gives Platt as the slave is now called a fiddle and forcefully intervenes when a brutal foreman abuses him. Yet Ford sells him to another plantation. The man is his property after all. He has the receipt for the purchase. Michael Fassbender is terrifying as Edwin Epps Northups vicious new owner. He quotes scripture as well (Luke 1247 a passage reverberating with ironies Epps cant discern) to justify the lashing of any slave who fails to deliver his daily cotton quota. Like livestock slaves may have kind or cruel owners but there are always owners. We might wish that Northup were an intrepid hero but hes a terrified everyman. At one point he is forced to lash his friend Patsey (Lupita Nyongo in a riveting debut) because Epps knows that forcing him to harm her will further break his spirit. Under slavery even friendship can be perverted into a tool of oppression. The film has a nuanced understanding of slavery a legal status that was not necessarily permanent. It notes that indentured white debtors worked and suffered alongside black slaves. Alfre Woodard has a standout cameo as a cynical former slave who charmed and married her owner and holds court on her mansions portico with slaves pouring her tea. Encountering such characters reinforces Northups hope for rescue. Freedom lost can be restored. When Brad Pitt arrives on the scene as a Canadian with abolitionist sympathies the machinery of justice begins to work. For one man. The film is not a flawless masterpiece. McQueen doesnt communicate the cadence of time passing and he triple-underlines his points (an intercepted letter to Northups family cant be burned without its dying embers being squeezed for every drop of blatant pathos). Still it is a bold important provocation. The key scene occurs at midpoint as Northup endures a terrible peril one that should make every witness throw down his tools and come running. Instead background characters go about their business heads down afraid to intervene. Its a reminder that looking the other way supports injustice. See the film. Read the original (Northups engrossing narrative is readily available as a free e-book). Think about it deeply.

""12 Years a Slave"" director Steve McQueens astonishing film about Solomon Northup upon whose autobiography it is based kicks those notions to the curb along with the gentrified sun-kissed romanticism of such movies as ""Gone With the Wind."" Anchored by a brilliant performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northup ""12 Years a Slave"" is not garish not overdone. McQueen simply plows straight ahead revealing one of the great horrors of slavery that for those living in the antebellum South ownership of one human being by another was simply a way of life. Finally in this film this is no longer just a notion softened with azaleas columned mansions and sweet Southern accents. Slavery is revealed for the unrelenting horror that it was. About time. Northup was a free Black man a musician living in New York with his wife and children in 1841. A couple of hucksters persuade him to come down to Washington D.C. to play his violin in the circus. Its good pay for a couple of weeks work but after a meal and wine Northup wakes up in chains. His freedom is gone. His identity is gone. His life as he knows it is gone. After savage beatings hes sold by a casually cruel trader (Paul Giamatti at his most chilling) to a man named Ford (the ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch). Ford treats him decently intrigued by his musical talents and obvious intellect. But despite his interest Ford cant conceive of Northup as anything more than a curiosity. When Northup erupts in anger against a cruel carpenter (Paul Dano) Ford sells him to Epps (Michael Fassbender) an insane drunken owner obsessed with Patsey (Lupita Nyongo terrific in her first feature) one of his slaves. This is not lost on his wife (Sarah Paulson) whose jealousy and anger fuel her mistreatment of Patsey and everyone else. Fassbender is great and its a powerful dynamic between Epps and his wife but McQueen wisely never takes the focus off Northup. To do so would be to fall into the trap of the typical movie dealing with slavery; to see it from the owners point of view. This is Northups story and Ejiofor portrays it with passion. Beaten but not broken Northup never loses his dignity or astoundingly his hope. How hard it must have been. In the films most astonishing scene Danos carpenter strings Northup up on the branch of a tree. He leaves just enough slack for Northups toes to touch the ground forcing Northup to gasp for breath as he performs a horrific dance. McQueen holds the shot for a long time letting us share Northups suffering. Whats most troubling however beyond the physical suffering is how life on the plantation goes on without pause as Northup dangles like some sort of nightmarish wind chime. A boy offers him water but otherwise no one -- slave White man no one -- pays him any mind. He is furniture. No hes less than that. Hes a slave. The acting is outstanding the direction assured if straightforward. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a history lesson of the best type. Its brilliant. But more crucially its important. Its brutal truth that demands to be seen. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

In the pre-Civil War United States Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a free black man from upstate New York is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty (personified by a malevolent sl... Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) lives comfortably with his wife and children in Saratoga Springs N.Y. in the early 1800s -- a time when far too many black people are far less fortunate. But for Northup everyday life has nothing to do with slavery. An impressive violinist he moves freely through white society and dresses in the style of a gentleman.And like any gentleman Northup appreciates having his ego stroked. So when two white men offer him a job as fiddler with a traveling circus hes only too happy to accept. But after sharing a meal with them in Washington D.C. he wakes up in chains.Thus begins Northups nightmare which includes being renamed Platt and subjected to the degradation that comes with being a slave. Northup struggles to hold onto his dignity while being careful not to reveal his true identity to those who claim to own him. But its hard for him to ignore the plight of Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) a strong but despairing woman who must endure the unwanted attention of their slaveholder Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).Based on a memoir by the real-life Northup ""12 Years a Slave"" is one of the best and most courageous films of the year. Working from a screenplay by John Ridley director Steve McQueen (""Shame"") refuses to soften the brutalities of slavery for mainstream consumption. True McQueen occasionally flirts with the kind of melodrama that has long been associated with tales of plantation life. But a prolonged scene in which Patsey is mercilessly whipped just about dares moviegoers not to turn away. Ejiofor delivers an Oscar-worthy performance thats at once wholly realized and heartbreaking. Fassbender a McQueen regular is chillingly memorable as a man for whom black people are nothing more than property.

After being drugged at a dinner party he wakes up in chains and shackles terrified. When he protests and explains there has been a mistake he is beaten by his white captors with a board. When it breaks they use a whip. ""You aint a free man"" one of them tells Solomon. ""Youre a Georgia runaway."" 12 Years a Slave was adapted by John Ridley from Northups memoir which was published in 1853 but had since fallen into obscurity and directed by Steve McQueen whose previous two films (Hunger and Shame) were rigorous graphic studies of unpleasant subject matter told with a cool intellectual detachment.  But although McQueen continues to keep his cameras trained on images most other filmmakers would leave to the imagination the filmmaker has also brought emotion and empathy to a subject matter rarely explored in Hollywood pictures - and then almost always in broad impersonal strokes. As played by Chiwetel Ejiofor (Redbelt American Gangster Children of Men) Solomon spends half the film in a state of disbelief - how could this be happening to him? In an early scene during an auction at the home of a slave trader (Paul Giamatti) he watches as a distraught mother is separated from her two children. When he snaps and rises up against a cowardly farmhand (Paul Dano) who delights in taunting him Solomon is strung up on a tree hands tied behind his back a noose around his neck surviving only by standing on his toes for what feels like hours (in the background we see slaves going about their daily business not even so much as looking at him because they know the same fate would befall them if they dared to interfere). As 12 Years a Slave goes on Solomon begins to understand his fellow slaves despair. The temptation to give up threatens to overcome the human instinct to survive. And after hes sold to the cotton farmer Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) a psychotic sadist known as a ""breaker"" of slaves Solomons existence becomes too miserable to bear. But an attempt to flee leads to a horrific dead-end. Still his spirit remains unbroken. When a distraught young slave Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) begs him to kill her (""I aint got no comfort in this life"" she says) Solomon reacts with bewilderment and declines. What kind of thing is that to ask of someone? One of the best things about 12 Years a Slave is that McQueen renders all the characters with the same depth and complexity as his protagonist. Fassbender plays Epps as an alcoholic who is also drunk on the power to treat other human beings like they were his toys. One night he stumbles into the slaves quarters shambling across the floor like a monster rousing them from their sleep and bringing him inside his home so they can dance for him. He rapes Patsey turned on by her weakness and vulnerability which does not sit well with his wife (a frightening Sarah Paulson) who may be even more demented than her husband. Fassbender invests himself into his character with an uncommon ferocity In one of the movies many long takes (a McQueen trademark) he brings his face right up to Solomons trying to determine whether  the slave is lying to him and he barely even blinks. But Fassbender also shows glimmers of Epps self-hatred and insecurities. He has a conscience - hes not a cartoon - but he refuses to deal with his guilt. Instead he simply takes it out on his slaves. 12 Years a Slave has several small but memorable supporting turns including Benedict Cumberbatch as another plantation owner who tries to help Solomon but ends up making his situation worse. In just one scene Alfre Woodard gives a performance as a former slave who has learned to work the system in order to sip tea from fine china in elegant dress that deserves its own movie (the film shrewdly examines the socioeconomic and class structures of slavery as if it were an industry). The films only misstep is an appearance by Brad Pitt in a small role as a Canadian carpenter who is baffled by slavery. The actor is fine but his celebrity status momentarily derails the picture - youre suddenly taken out of the story - and the saintly dialogue he spouts doesnt help (""What is true and right is true and right for all"" he says of civil rights). But that minor distraction is easy to forgive. 12 Years a Slave has moments of silent poetic beauty such as a scene in which Solomon stands alone in the woods listening to the sounds of nature around him trying to wrap his mind around the situation hes stranded in. The movie does not shy away from the innate brutality of its subject matter Although there is nothing here as graphic as the mandingo fight in Django Unchained McQueen does give you a close-up look at what a prolonged bout of whipping does to the human body. More importantly though the film also shows you the effect such violence has on the mind and soul creating scars that endure for generations. 12 Years a Slave is at times difficult to watch but always impossible to turn away from Its the true story of one man used to illustrate the travails of millions some of whom like Solomon managed to find a way to survive and endure.

"Review Is 12 Years a Slave the best film of 2013? - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Is 12 Years a Slave the best film of 2013?By Randy Myers San Jose Mercury News contributorPosted 10/29/2013 030000 PM PDTUpdated 11/13/2013 093902 AM PSTRelated StoriesDec 1612 years a Slave named best movie by San Francisco Film CriticsNov 12Hicks 12 Years a Slave may be best film thats too hard to stomachNov 8A big decision with 12 Years a Slave is whom to see the film withEverything youve heard about ""12 Years a Slave"" is true.That its so horrific at points youll need to turn away from the screen. That it will make you sob uncontrollably and render you emotionally spent. That its an unflinching look at the cruel and nauseating reality of slavery a bloody stain on American history.But this the best film of 2013 so far is not intended to needlessly subjugate and brutalize its audience. British-born director Steve McQueens uncompromising adaptation of Solomon Northrups 1853 account of a free black man whos sold into slavery is not only damningly powerful its damn well important both historically and cinematically. The film takes an ugly topic thats too often been packaged in neatly sanitized snippets or told through the filtered perspective of a noble white bystander and gives it the voice integrity and intensity it demands. From the Oscar-caliber performances -- Chiwetel Ejiofor in the lead and Lupita Nyongo and Michael Fassbender in supporting roles -- to the devastating images created by McQueen ""12 Years a Slave"" is a modern cinematic masterpiece. Each role on-screen and off makes it stronger Joe Walkers precise editing Hans Zimmers haunting soundtrack the transformative production design by Adam Stockhausen and costume design by Patricia Norris. We meet Solomon when hes living as a freed family man in New York during the pre-Civil War days. His nightmarish ordeal begins when hes kidnapped and sent to Louisiana where hes turned into human livestock for 12 long years. Nothing is sugarcoated here -- the lashings the beatings the pokings the proddings the sheer ugliness of a white man at his worst. What does offer an ember of hope is how it shows the resilient spirit of a black man stuck in a freak show of moral decay.Advertisement Yes ""Slave"" is demanding. Still its never gratuitous or sensationalized.The sequence that hit me hardest is a long scene in which Solomon is seen strung up to a tree gasping for air as his feet graze the ground just enough to keep him breathing. As this hideous torture show plays itself out children romp nearby enjoying the lovely day. Without a doubt these contrasting images create one of most deeply disturbing scenes Ive ever witnessed in a film. McQueen is a bold director allowing his camera to linger long enough to create an unsettling mood. Hes also a provocateur a man who latches onto grim topics -- from a starving British IRA activist (""Hunger"") to a sex addict with sister issues (""Shame""). Both works were excellent but almost clinical in their emotional distance. ""12 Years a Slave"" puts you me all of us right into the shoes and the soul of Solomon. That happens not only because of McQueens direction but Ejiofors impassioned vulnerable performance. Ejiofor (""Kinky Boots"") has long been an actor on the cusp and here he gets his breakout role. His Solomon is a smart guy a violinist and proud family man who is sold to William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) a minister who fancies himself a benevolent master even as he callously separates one of his purchases (Adepero Oduye) from her children. Solomon works hard for William but he lands in trouble when he gets into a fight with a creepy carpenter (Paul Dano).He has been given the name Platt and eventually winds up on a plantation owned by Edwin Epps (Fassbender in his most complex role yet) a sociopath whos married to a pseudo-pious woman (a frightening Sarah Paulson). Caught in the middle of this highly dysfunctional relationship is Patsey (Nyongo in a career-making performance) who is raped by Epps and traumatized endlessly by his wife. This awful couple subject Solomon and Patsey to unfathomable injustices forcing Nyongo and Ejiofor to go to dark places.The one flaw with ""Slave"" comes in the form of Brad Pitts character Samuel Bass and you sense screenwriter John Ridley struggling to further the story along with Pitts abolitionist from Canada. While Pitt is fine his dialogue is stiff intended to be the bridge for the next development. Fortunately it doesnt diminish the films overall effect.The greatest challenge McQueens masterwork likely will encounter is a reluctance by the public to see such a disturbing film. But just as ""Saving Private Ryan"" revealed what life in the D-Day trenches was like ""Schindlers List"" put us inside a Nazi concentration camp and the 1977 miniseries ""Roots"" finally gave voice to the black experience in America ""12 Years a Slave"" presents us with an unvarnished uncensored and much-needed view of history. This is not medicine for America to swallow; its filmmaking of the highest caliber.

Grade A+ This epic of a free black man kidnapped and sold into slavery bristles with texture and feeling - you experience his tortures and hopes vividly and immediately as if the filmmakers had discovered a kind of 3D IMAX that expands your heart and brain rather than the screen. Director Steve McQueen screenwriter John Ridley and their star Chiwetel Ejiofor forge an instant intimacy between the audience and Solomon Northup a violinist and jack of all trades from Saratoga N.Y.  reduced to cutting cane and picking cotton under the lash in Louisiana. In two startling opening vignettes they depict him struggling in secret to whittle and wield a pen and succumbing to the sexual touch of a beauty lying next to him in slave quarters. Its as if the filmmakers and their lead actor are making a covenant with the audience - they vow to flesh out a form of human bondage that encompasses a mans entirety from his intellect to his sexuality. When they flash back to his happy days in Saratoga the simple sights of him caressing his wife putting his kids to bed fiddling gaily for a dance or walking through the town en famille sting with the sweet air of freedom. Based on the 1853 memoir Northup wrote with David Wilson the movie mostly tells his story straight from the moment hes conned by two white entertainers who lure him to Washington D.C. with the promise of some lucrative gigs. There he is drugged chained up in a slave pen transported to a market in New Orleans and sold to the owner of a bayou plantation. He spends a dozen years as a field hand carpenter fiddler and messenger or delivery boy - always working under the whips and whims of arbitrary unreliable or sadistic masters. The movie compresses a dozen years of Solomons torment into a transfixing account of a sensitive intelligent man attempting to survive the unremitting abuse and anguish of slave life. You are there with Solomon. Whether youre rushing with him through the bayou - he considers escape until he runs into a double lynching - or being roused with him and a dozen others late at night to play and dance for a bored masters amusement you feel part of his world. The filmmakers exhibit remarkable moral and aesthetic poise. They present atrocities without exploitation and salvation without sentimentality. Ejiofor is their full-fledged collaborator. He gives a heroic performance in an extraordinarily difficult role. Solomons captors immediately seek to destroy his identity. They beat him savagely until he stops proclaiming himself a free man from New York. For most of the movie he hides his literacy and answers to the name of ""Platt"" a runaway from Georgia. Ejiofor establishes his character so surely that audiences always see his true self in his eyes. Hes resourceful and loving but also realistic and stoic. He learns when he can challenge a white man and when he must lower his head and accept his place. When hes forced to commit acts of cruelty the moviemakers are wise enough not to condemn him. Hes trapped in an evil system. Solomon knows theres no hope for him to regain his former life unless he can pull through this one even if it means courting favor with vicious owners. The film is filled with searing portraits - including a gallery of tragic women like the elegant Eliza (Adeparo Oduye) who gives in to despair or the petite yet mighty Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) queen of the field who picks over 500 pounds of cotton a day but gets caught in the sexual whirlpool of her masters lust and his wifes jealousy. The white actors embody their characters with urgent authenticity. Paul Giamatti is whip-smart as the keen-eyed slave dealer who delights in showing off prize physiques. He holds his cane waist-high and makes a small boy high-kick up to it demonstrating the lads potential for growing into a mighty ""beast."" But the movies prime antagonism is always between Solomon/Platt often shown in close-up and the entire system of slavery depicted in eloquent tableaux. The dehumanizing process begins with merciless beatings. It continues with men women and children stripping and washing together in the D.C. slave pens courtyard. On the paddleboat to Louisiana a white man casually seizes a female slave for his pleasure and just as matter-of-factly dispatches a black man who rises in mute protest. In New Orleans Eliza is separated from her young son and daughter. Shes told shell soon get over their loss. Of course she never does. What makes Solomons saga affecting and cathartic as well as harrowing is the range of attitudes he encounters in the swampy Louisiana landscape. His first owner is a gentle Christian William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) who pegs him as ""exceptional."" Yet Fords kindness is double-edged. He gives Solomon a violin - he says he hopes it will bring them pleasure for many years. You gasp at the irony beneath the gesture. Cumberbatch is a marvel as a good man who cant rise beyond convention. He employs a carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) who mocks slaves in derisive songs and takes a particular envy-tinged hatred toward Solomon. Tibeats and two henchmen sling a rope around Solomons neck and start to hang him. When an overseer halts the lynching Solomon is left dangling in place until his master Ford finally arrives. The slave keeps his body at full stretch - in a one-man ballet of degradation he must reach for muddy ground with his toes to keep the noose from strangling him. As the sun rises to full height then fades and sets he sways in the middle of the frame as the other slaves in back of him leave their cabins and go about their labors. (One woman dares to bring a cup of water to his lips.) Its as if theyre caught in separate circles of hell. Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) Solomons next master reads Scripture to find justification for applying the lash to human chattel. Solomon finds himself caught in the cross-purposes of three fervid people the drunken irrational master; the object of his obsession - the champion cotton-picker Patsey; and Mistress Epps (Sarah Paulson) who seethes with jealousy over her husbands lust for a slave. The actors here are spellbinders - Fassbender as a man unable to comprehend the intensity of his feeling for a slave Paulson as a wife who siphons her spurned passion into targeted sadism and Lupita Nyongo as a strong beautiful woman who finds her virtues turned against her. And Ejiofor conveys the toll this bloody tragedy exacts from Solomon. His face takes on a mournful cast. The movies time-machine impact comes partly from its virtuoso use of antique language. Almost all the actors speak comfortably in 19th century dialect and diction none more fluidly than Ejiofor and Fassbender. At one point Epps accuses Solomon of betrayal. Hearing the black man use his wits to deflect the charge is like drinking in a tense thrilling scherzo. The language fits the production design and costumes which usher audiences into a universe that juxtaposes barbarism and formality. Rafting down a silt-covered creek in a grey-green swamp with Solomon the damp seems to settle on your own skin. Later when this sophisticated individualistic man loses his aplomb and joins his fellow slaves in singing ""Roll Jordan Roll"" his ache for salvation is tangible. The novelist L.P. Hartley wrote ""The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there."" This movie makes you feel like a native of the past for two hours and a quarter. You leave it feeling gratitude - and relief. McQueen has said his goal in directing this film was to bring attention to Solomons memoir. Hes created an act of witness thats also a work of art.

In 1984 American director Gordon Parks ( Shaft) made Twelve Years a Slave Solomon Northups Odyssey for PBS starring Avery Brooks ( Star Trek Deep Space Nine). Its still available through Amazon.com as well as Monterey Media and was well-reviewed at the time and won an award from the Organization of American Historians. As critic Leonard Maltin wrote recently ""I hope the notoriety surrounding 12 Years a Slave will call attention to at least one vintage TV movie thats worth a second look."" -- Cary Darling By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 452pm on Thursday Oct. 24 2013 Thursday Oct. 24 2013 Thursday Oct. 24 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There are many scenes in 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueens exquisitely rendered take on a true story of one mans struggle with ""the peculiar institution"" that sear themselves into the mind. But theres one thats especially haunting.Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a free black man in pre-Civil War upstate New York who has been abducted and sold into slavery in the South is being punished for turning the whip on one of his overseers (Paul Dano). He is hanged from a tree but because his toes just barely touch the ground he doesnt die but dangles there his tortured breathing the only soundtrack.Meanwhile life goes on around him unfettered. Except for one young woman who surreptitiously brings him a cup of water the other slaves quietly ignore him. The very proper mistress of the plantation (Sarah Paulson) looks on from her porch unconcerned.Its an emotionally devastating scene made all the more powerful by the way McQueen (the movies Shame and Hunger) shoots it. Theres no music and it lingers for what seems like forever conveying the feeling of looking at a particularly powerful painting. (Thats not at all surprising considering McQueen came to filmmaking from visual arts.)But the much talked-about 12 Years a Slave is more than a beautifully shot art piece. Its history made violently real. Unlike last years movie about slavery Quentin Tarantinos boisterous but bankrupt Django Unchained 12 Years a Slave feels uncomfortably real. While the likes of Roots and Amistad begin with a focus on the recently enslaved not long out of Africa 12 Years (based on Northups memoir) starts with a different figure a black man born free in North America who has no firsthand knowledge of slavery. He is married has a family and is respected in his community by white and black alike.An ardent violinist Northup is lured to Washington D.C. by two men with the promise of a big payday for his musical skills. Thats when his dream of a life turns into a waking nightmare.Working from a screenplay by author/commentator John Ridley ( Red Tails Three Kings) McQueen could have gone heavy with the melodrama and mawkishness. Instead he keeps it simple letting the emotion well up from the situation and then not turning away. Thats the case with the whipping scene of Northups friend Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) where he is forced to become his masters brutal hand. Its hard to watch not simply for the physical violence but for its sheer emotional wallop.It helps that the British director elicits strong performances from all of his actors especially his countrymen Ejiofor who should become a household name after this performance; Michael Fassbender as troubled and viciously cruel plantation owner Edwin Epps; and Benedict Cumberbatch as the kind but conflicted and ineffectual plantation owner Ford. The one false note comes from oddly the man without whose help the film might not have been made. Co-producer Brad Pitt plays Samuel Bass a Canadian abolitionist Northup meets during his time in the South. Though this character is based on a man in Northups life it feels forced as if the studio added him to give the movie a big-name star with whom viewers could identify.But this is a small complaint in what is otherwise a masterful work of both historical horror and visual beauty.

"12 Years a Slave | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 12-years-a-slave ) 12 Years a Slave (United States 2013) October 23 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli 12 Years a Slave sure to be a heavy hitter when the 2014 Oscar nominations are announced is a powerful and compelling adaptation of Solomon Northups autobiographical account of the dozen years he spent as a slave on Louisiana plantations from 1841 until 1853. When it comes to depicting the conditions in which slaves lived and worked 12 Years a Slave doesnt soft-sell anything. Scenes of brutality are routinely depicted in unflinching shots that skate close to an NC-17 edge. The screenplay credited to John Ridley offers a condensed and slightly reworked history of Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a New York free man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. He toiled on plantations for 12 years serving under various owners until he found an ally in a white Canadian carpenter who was willing to take word of his plight north. After being freed Northups story was published and sold some 30000 copies. After being forgotten for about a century it was rediscovered during the 1960s. Steve McQueens (Shame) movie isnt the first adaptation - the 1984 TV film Solomon Northups Odyssey told the story albeit with the violence and brutality considerably toned down from what is depicted in 12 Years a Slave. The film offers a formidable indictment of the cruelty of which human beings are capable. Not every white man in the film is vile - Benedict Cumberbatchs Ford and Brad Pitts Bass are counter-examples - but even the best men are hamstrung by the social and cultural mores of the time. Two people embody the most unpleasant aspects of white men in the South - Tibeats (Paul Dano) a worker on Fords land and Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) a cotton plantation owner. Both perceive blacks as less than human thereby making their treatment of them justifiable. Epps also uses Biblical verses to validate his occasionally horrific actions. It has been said that the Bible can be used to justify almost any atrocity and this is an example. Epps view was widely shared throughout the South before during and even after the Civil War. 12 Years a Slave is dominated by Chiwetel Ejiofor whose performance is sure to earn an Oscar nomination. Like Daniel Day Lewis Lincoln in 2013 this is the one acting turn that rises to the top emerging as heads-and-shoulders above other worthy contenders. Ejiofors facial expressions captured in lingering close-ups by McQueen display a variety of emotions with such utter conviction that they cut to the quick. Ejiofor is equally good in scenes that depict Northups comfortable home life before the abduction his confusion during his early days of captivity and his stolid determination while suffering under the yoke of oppression. His ""Oscar moment"" occurs at the very end in a scene that will bring tears to the eyes of even the most hard-hearted audience member. As the movies villain Michael Fassbender provides an Epps who is not only rotten to the core but unhinged (either by drink religious fervor or some kind of mental illness). The character is more frightening than Paul Danos Tibeats because of his unpredictability and his position of power. The scene in which he commands Northup to whip Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) is as close to unwatchable as anything represented on film this year. The performances of the principals elevate 12 Years a Slaves already absorbing narrative to a higher level. If theres one complaint to be made about the acting it relates to some of the smaller roles. Using Paul Giamatti Alfre Woodard and Brad Pitt in secondary parts (bordering on extended cameos) it creates ""spot the star"" moments that are more of a distraction than an asset. While theres nothing wrong with Pitts portrayal his larger-than-life presence overwhelms an underdeveloped character. Its not a fatal mistake but its a questionable choice. The movie is powerful enough to overcome such minor missteps but it shouldnt have to. Hans Zimmer is often criticized for bombastic scores but his work here hits all the right notes. Its ominous and understated and enhances the tension and grimness of many situations. McQueen also took pains to recreate Civil War-era plantations by using detail from the source material as well as other historical documents to inform period aspects of the film. 12 Years a Slave is unsettling and upsetting as only a story of this sort can be. There are elements of courage and redemption but the lingering impression reminds us of how ugly the dark side of human nature can be. Like movies about Nazi Germany this film illustrates the horrors that can take root beneath the foundations of economic prosperity and civilization. 12 Years a Slave is by no means light entertainment but it provides a more worthwhile cinematic experience than about 90% of whats out there and the impressions it leaves arent easily dismissed or dispelled. 12 Years a Slave (United States 2013) Director Steve McQueen Cast Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Fassbander Lupita Nyongo Benedict Cumberbatch Paul Dano Sarah Paulson Adepero Oduye Brad Pitt Screenplay John Ridley based on the book by Solomon Northup Cinematography Sean Bobbitt Music Hans Zimmer U.S. Distributor Fox Searchlight Run Time 213 U.S. Release Date 2013-10-18 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Violence Disturbing Images Nudity Sexual Content) Genre DRAMA Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Cider House Rules The (1999) Maria Full of Grace (2004) Lilya 4-Ever (2003) worse movies of this genre Hole in My Heart A (2005) Neon Demon The (2016) Showgirls (1995) Three...better movies of Chiwetel Ejiofor Martian The (2015) American Gangster (2007) Inside Man (2006) worse movies of Chiwetel Ejiofor 2012 (2009) Redbelt (2008) Salt (2010) Three...better movies of Michael Fassbander (There are no more better movies of Michael Fassbander) worse movies of Michael Fassbander (There are no more worst movies of Michael Fassbander) Three...better movies of Lupita Nyongo (There are no more better movies of Lupita Nyongo) worse movies of Lupita Nyongo Non-Stop (2014) (There are no more worst movies of Lupita Nyongo) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2678,200,12yearsaslave17,12yearsaslave,reelviews

Or maybe just cover your eyes for a few minutes of respite. Try not to. In 12 Years a Slave Chiwetel Ejiofor -- who up until now was best known for playing Keira Knightleys husband in Love Actually -- rivets as Solomon Northup a New York violinist and family man in 1841. His fate changes forever after hes drugged kidnapped and sold into slavery. In a blink his freedom is cruelly stripped away along with his name. All he has left to hold on to is his dignity and fleeting memories of a rich former life. PHOTOS Best movies of 2012 One look at the title tells you that Solomons journey lasts for an agonizing dozen years. Director Steve McQueen (Shame) lays out Solomons 12-year journey episodically starting with Paul Giamattis unnervingly cold-hearted auctioneer selling him off. Stock belligerent Southerners come and go. By far the most engrossing and searing chapter focuses on his time with a sadistic plantation owner (Michael Fassbender). The scenes between master and servant chill to the core Audiences wont soon forget the sneering look on Fassbenders face when he tells Solomon in the dead of night that hes caught on to his plan for escape. PHOTOS Brad Pitts different movie looks And yet the drama is at its most unflinching when words arent spoken Such is the brutality of watching Solomon tip-toe the ground while hanging from a noose in extreme heat and hearing a whip repeatedly strike the back of a defiant female servant (Lupita Nyongo amazing). Theres no relief from the despair until nearly two hours in when a Canadian contractor (co-producer Brad Pitt in a cameo) meets Solomon and hears of his plight. It soon becomes clear that the grim depths here are necessary to appreciate the rays of hope and morality. PHOTOS Best-dressed at the 2013 Oscars Yes this is your worthy Oscar front-runner. Its a film every bit as immersive as Gravity and harrowing as Captain Phillips. And unlike last years overrated Lincoln it doesnt feel like a ponderous and pretentious lecture on 19th century slavery. Instead audiences are left to see the perils for themselves.

""Yall gonna be in the cuttin gang.""We soon discover what this entails as the slaves take machetes in hand and begin hacking their way through an almost endless expanse of sugar cane; they might as well be trying to empty the ocean using teacups. The physicality of their labor is not merely extreme it is extravagant. We immediately understand that what we are witnessing is an economy predicated on the idea that human--that is black--sweat and sinew are not merely cheap resources but essentially inexhaustible ones subject to careless squander.The scene establishes the searing visceral tone that will characterize director Steve McQueens audacious third feature. Moments later we watch as the films protagonist Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) lies awake in a bunkhouse surrounded by fellow slaves. When he turns to the woman next to him she takes his hand roughly to her breast and then between her legs grimacing with joyless urgency before she twists away from him. Day and night a perpetuity of toil and a pantomime of love--it all comes down to this to flesh and blood to individual endurance in a solitary prison of pain.Related Story Captain Phillips The Movie of the Moment The film is a true story based on the 1853 autobiography of Northup who was a freeman in Saratoga New York--an upscale husband and father a gifted violinist--when he was tricked by two white men into visiting Washington DC for a series of performances. There after a fancy dinner with his cultured collegial hosts he awakened to find himself manacled in a cell and stripped of his papers. Viciously beaten before being smuggled out of the city by boat--we see a shot of the Capitol dome in the background--he was given the name ""Platt"" sold at auction and sent to work on a series of plantations in Louisiana. His perspective was thus an extraordinary one experiencing the institution of slavery at once from within and without enduring its horrors firsthand yet also as an educated man who had been accepted even celebrated among white society in the North. McQueens film is not however an intellectual inquiry or an exercise in self-congratulating moral uplift. Rather it is a blistering portrait of the human capacity for cruelty. It ends ""happily"" yes (Northup did after all go on to write his memoir) but no conclusion could begin to erase the ordeal that preceded it. I struggle to think of any major film--Schindlers List perhaps or Hotel Rwanda--that has dealt so pitilessly with a horror so vast.Northup is first sent to work for a relatively kind plantation owner (Benedict Cumberbatch) who appreciates his intellect. (""Platt"" he tells him ""you are a marvel."") But following an ugly episode with an overseer (Paul Dano) he is sent away in part for his own safety and in part as repayment of a debt. Northups new owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) is drunk debauched and depraved; the outwardly courteous mistress of the plantation (Sarah Paulson) is if anything worse still consumed with jealousy for a slave Patsey (newcomer Lupita Nyongo) with whom her husband is obsessed.Working from a script by John Ridley McQueen is particularly unabashed in unpacking the perverted intimacies between masters and slaves. The fact that Epps values Patsey more than his wife--and tells the latter so to her face--does not mean that he values Patsey as anything more than a body his best picker of cotton and a defenseless vessel for his lust. Meanwhile at a neighboring plantation the slave-turned-common-law-wife (Alfre Woodard) who takes pride in escaping the fields for her masters bed nonetheless smiles as she wishes a Biblical apocalypse upon him and all his ilk.McQueen presents a world in which every sentiment every human transaction has been twisted by its contact with slavery.Elsewhere too McQueen finds pockets of moral complication the former overseer (Garret Dillahunt) who explains with apparent sincerity that a man cannot whip other human beings without ""shredding himself""; the fellow freeman who explains to Northup that the others who were captured with them are ""niggers born and bred"" and who is himself later saved by posing as the property of another man. (Even where slavery is accepted thievery remains a sin.) When we watch Northups first owner reading scripture to his slaves his intents seem entirely benevolent; when we watch Epps do the same explicitly warning of divine retribution for disobedience we are forced to reconsider. McQueen presents a world in which every sentiment every human transaction has been twisted by its contact with slavery.At the center of it all is Northup the outsider locked into a nightmare. Ejiofor has given notable performances in the past (Dirty Pretty Things Serenity Talk to Me) but this is by far his most essential role to date. Stoic watchful compromising himself just enough to stay alive he is the point of stillness and decency around which spin the madnesses of the film. One scene seems almost to literalize this proposition as Northup saved from a lynching but with the noose still tight around his neck stands choking on tiptoe for hours as the life of the plantation goes on all around no one daring to untie him.The remainder of the cast is strong as well--in particular Nyongo as Patsey--with the unfortunate exception of Brad Pitt who appears late in the film as a high-minded itinerant worker from Canada. Its not that he is bad exactly its that hes... Brad. While other well-recognized actors make appearances in the film (Paul Giamatti for instance) Pitt is the only one whose persona overwhelms his role; its as if he has wandered in from another more conventional movie. (It does not help that the character he is playing arrives essentially as a deus ex machina.) That said Pitt was instrumental in producing the film and if a somewhat-ill-fitting performance was the price to be paid it was one well worth paying.The cinematography by Sean Bobbitt (who worked with McQueen on his previous features) is stunning; and the score by Hans Zimmer represents his best work in years an eerie discomfiting soundscape that buzzes like angry locusts and drums like approaching thunder.But from first frame to last 12 Years a Slave is McQueens achievement and it represents a huge leap forward for the director. His earlier films Hunger and Shame were beautiful but remote aesthetic exercises in the mortifications of the flesh. 12 Years a Slave is no less carnal in its inquiries--it is in its most literal sense a film about bodies bought and sold--but its context and purposes are so much weightier that they tether McQueens gifts enabling him to transcend ""arty"" and produce a work of genuine unmistakable art. 12 Years a Slave is likely the most painful clear-eyed feature ever made about American slavery. In that light it almost seems faint praise to add that it will likely also prove to be the best film of the year.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Graham The Fox hosts insistence that black laborers building the White House were ""well-fed and had decent lodgings"" fits in a long history of insisting the ""peculiar institution"" wasnt so bad. In her widely lauded speech at the Democratic National Convention on Monday Michelle Obama reflected on the remarkable fact of her African American family living in the executive mansion. ""I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters two beautiful intelligent black young women playing with their dogs on the White House lawn"" she said. On Tuesday Fox News host Bill OReilly discussed the moment in his Tip of the Day. In a moment first noticed by the liberal press-tracking group Media Matters OReilly said this As we mentioned Talking Points Memo Michelle Obama referenced slaves building the White House in referring to the evolution of America in a positive way. It was a positive comment. The history behind her remark is fascinating. George Washington selected the site in 1791 and as president laid the cornerstone in 1792. Washington was then running the country out of Philadelphia. Slaves did participate in the construction of the White House. Records show about 400 payments made to slave masters between 1795 and 1801. In addition free blacks whites and immigrants also worked on the massive building. There were no illegal immigrants at that time. If you could make it here you could stay here. In 1800 President John Adams took up residence in what was then called the Executive Mansion. It was only later on they named it the White House. But Adams was in there with Abigail and they were still hammering nails the construction was still going on. Slaves that worked there were well-fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802. However the feds did not forbid subcontractors from using slave labor. So Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House but there were others working as well. Got it all? There will be a quiz. Continue Reading The Tiny Irish Island That Will Welcome American Refugees Nadine Ajaka Welcome to Inishturk where they really dont like Donald Trump.

Francois Duhamel/Fox Searchlight Pictures 12 Years a Slave Director Steve McQueen Genre Biopic drama Running Time 133 minutes Rated R for violence/cruelty some nudity and brief sexuality With Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Fassbender Lupita Nyongo Benedict Cumberbatch (Recommended) Just a few years before the start of the Civil War two anti-slavery books became best-sellers in the United States. One was Uncle Toms Cabin the Harriet Beecher Stowe opus that went on to become the best-selling novel of the 19th century. The other was a memoir with a mouthful of a title Twelve Years a Slave Narrative of Solomon Northup a citizen of New-York kidnapped in Washington City in 1841 and rescued in 1853 from a cotton plantation near the Red River in Louisiana. Twelve Years a Slave -- successful enough to prompt multiple editions before falling into obscurity after the war -- was rediscovered by scholars in the 1960s and has now been transformed into a wrenching soul-stirring film from British director Steve McQueen. The film begins with an enslaved Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) cutting sugar cane on a Louisiana plantation then flashes back to the life hed been leading just a few years earlier in Saratoga Springs N.Y. There he was a musician of stature living with his wife and three kids in comfort and even some luxury. A free black family in a state that did not allow slavery they inhabited a world of learning and culture. In fact its Solomons talent as a violinist that leads to his downfall. He accompanies two men to Washington for what he thinks is a fiddling job only to have them get him drunk and betray him. New York has laws protecting its African-American residents. The nations capital does not. He wakes up in chains. i Patsy (Lupita Nyongo) another of Epps slaves becomes the subject of her masters unwanted attentions -- and the abuse of his jealous wife. Francois Duhamel/Fox Searchlight Pictures hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Fox Searchlight Pictures Patsy (Lupita Nyongo) another of Epps slaves becomes the subject of her masters unwanted attentions -- and the abuse of his jealous wife. Francois Duhamel/Fox Searchlight Pictures Without papers to establish his identity far from anyone who knows him Solomon is helpless when his kidnappers rename him Platt and ship him off to Louisiana to be sold. As other desperate men in chains tell him hell be killed if he even says his real name let alone tries to escape. Survival means ""keeping your head down"" hes told. ""I dont want to survive"" he gasps. ""I want to live."" Still survival comes first. Sold to a Baptist preacher (Benedict Cumberbatch) who realizes theres more to him than meets the eye and who treats him as another slave puts it like ""prized livestock"" Solomon does keep his head down. He bides his time and urges others around him to do the same. Inwardly though hes seething. And when another slave accuses him of truckling to his master he roars ""My back is thick with scars for protesting my freedom."" McQueen keeps those scars -- and the brutality that creates them -- front and center in 12 Years a Slave with incidents that scald and searing supporting performances particularly from Michael Fassbender (star of McQueens previous art-house films Hunger and Shame) as a sadistic but strangely conflicted slave owner. But it is Ejiofor -- bewildered sorely tested morally towering -- whose staggered dignity anchors the film. John Ridleys script brings both historical sweep and an urgent intimacy to Northups story -- no small accomplishment. Rife with visceral beatings multiple lynchings and an almost casual air of psychological cruelty 12 Years a Slave is anything but easy to watch but it is powerfully moving. Its also a powerful corrective because it so skillfully links that brutality to the sort of tranquil antebellum South that Hollywood has often peddled -- the broad porches the hoop skirts the fields fluffy with cotton. It will be hard for audiences to see those images ever again without thinking about the savagery and injustice that propped them up.

Why have there been so few Hollywood movies about slavery and why did it take a British director to make this one?Having said that I wish the truly searing moments in this film were not continually counterbalanced by an overall historical-reenactment stiffness in the presentation. McQueen stages tableaux vivants. As in his other movies ""Shame"" and ""Hunger"" he makes artworks about the rending of the flesh. The large cast includes Michael Fassbender as a particularly odious slave owner Brad Pitt in a cameo as the Good White Guy and the remarkable Lupita Nyongo as a young slave girl whose suffering embodies the obscenity of the institution.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 18 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 18 2013 1201AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Steve McQueen Written by John Ridley Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender Classification 14A Year 2013 Country USA Language English The film 12 Years a Slave British director Steve McQueens antebellum Southern drama sets a new standard in realistically depicting American slavery. With slavery at the heart of the paradox - the United States existence was founded on the principle of liberty - a mainstream film that depicts that bleak part of history is exceptional. Video Video 12 Years a Slave Stars speak to the intense and ugly scenes For that reason alone 12 Years A Slave is probably the film event of the year but worthiness in itself can be deadly - even if it does win Academy Awards. Fortunately 12 Years a Slave is also exceptional as a film. Far from the push-button catharsis offered by most Hollywood redemption tales the work is sober and deliberate a mix of visceral intensity and artful design.In contrast most of the current cycle of historical civil rights movies including Django Unchained The Help and Lee Daniels The Butler look as though they were made for and by children (the exception being Steven Spielbergs Lincoln).McQueens previous two art-house successes - the Irish prison drama Hunger (2008) and the sex-addiction film Shame (2011) - both starring Michael Fassbender were dispassionate portraits of men in different kinds of hell. McQueens new film is painted on a larger canvas using popular stars (Fassbender Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt) who earned screams from behind the cordon at the Toronto International Film Festival in September where the film won the Peoples Choice Award. Yet its portrait of Solomon Northrup a free black man living in New York in the 1840s who was kidnapped and sold into slavery is another chronicle of wretchedness.If Hunger was theatre of cruelty and Shame a contemporary opera 12 Years a Slave is like its source material raw melodrama. The book written by Northrup in 1853 with white co-author David Wilson and published a year after the centurys bestselling novel Uncle Toms Cabin was intended to fuel abolitionist outrage at slavery. Yet while the film owes a debt to an effective polemical tear-jerker its framed with the cool detachment of McQueen the Turner Prize-winning contemporary gallery artist. And screenwriter John Ridley (U-Turn Three Kings) drafts a careful reconstruction of Northups testimony; the literary dialogue is often transferred directly from page to screen.""Your story - it is an amazing one and in no good way"" says Northrups eventual rescuer a Canadian carpenter called Sam Bass (Pitt). While these people were closer to the King James Bible than we are today the dialogue has the ring of writerly artifice. The director and screenwriter have chosen to replicate that instead of trying to make it more accessible or realistic.McQueen has compared the 12 Years narrative to the fairy tale of Pinocchio who was abducted into a strange and dangerous world. Some scenes of sun shining through giant sycamore trees in the Louisiana swamp or of fields of sugar cane or cotton suggest Terrence Malicks nature images in The New World. Throughout there is an emphasis on looking often in long takes and at times were witnessing torture that wed rather not watch.An early image in the film echoed in later sequences consists of a group of slaves in work clothes standing in a field and staring warily at the camera. The shot suggests an anthropology textbook or one of those 19th-century slave portraits. After the first long stare we cut to a white overseer in front of a wall of tall reeds instructing the slaves on how to harvest sugar cane.The first flashback to Solomons early life as a free man seems like a hallucination. Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) appears in three-piece suit and top hat walking the streets of Saratoga N.Y. with his wife and family greeting fellow townspeople. His background is briefly sketched. We know hes a fiddler (also a farmer and handyman in real life) whose wife is going away to cook for a family for three weeks. On the village green one day he is introduced to two strangers somewhat absurd fancy talkers who say they work with the circus and they offer him highly paid employment playing music for them if he will just follow them to Washington.After a journey and a night of drinking with his new companions he awakes in a basement in chains. Solomon travels for the first years in bondage. After being taken on a boat to the Louisiana slave market he is renamed Platt by a slave dealer (Paul Giamatti) and sold to the kindly and religious Ford (Cumberbatch). At first he does not always hide his outrage well losing his temper with a petty sadistic overseer (Paul Dano) and turning the lash on him. He is barely saved from a lynching. To save his life Ford sells Solomon to another owner Edwin Epps (Fassbender) a man who prides himself on his ability to break strong-willed slaves.Much of the remainder of the film is a psychological wrestling match between Solomon and Epps. At first Epps seems like a stock villain (like Simon Legree the cruel master in Uncle Toms Cabin) but Fassbender makes him into a more complex character. The script draws out the twisted dance of the master-slave relationship. Epps is alcoholic violent and impulsive but not entirely one-dimensional. He and his wife (Sarah Paulson) are caught in a bitter marriage and their dependence on slave help seems to have made them infantile themselves. The central issue of the marriage is that Epps is sexually fixated on Solomons friend a slave named Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) who suffers as much from Epps attention as from her mistresss jealous hatred.In the films most graphic scene Epps partly to appease his wife and in a rage at his own confused emotions has the young woman stripped tied and whipped so violently a mist of blood forms each time the lash strikes. For comparable violence youd have to go to Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ. McQueen is partial to images that suggest religious iconography so the parallel doesnt seem entirely accidental. Audiences may reasonably ask why they should be shown such excruciating simulated torture; the director clearly thought the scene was important for those audiences to witness.Solomon meanwhile is ingenious patient and desperately determined and hes also our primary witness here. If theres a coldness to McQueens gaze on suffering Ejiofor a British actor of Nigerian descent who previously starred in Kinky Boots and in Dirty Pretty Things uses his wide sad eyes and formal manner to maintain an empathetic human connection. In a film where we are forced to confront that which is barely credible Ejiofors performance provides a powerful countertone of understatement.

Photo Everett Collection MOVIE REVIEW 12 Years a Slave The ""Schindlers List"" of slavery films. Running time 134 minutes. Rated R (explicitly brutal violence). At the Empire the Union Square and the Lincoln Plaza. It will be impossible to ever look at ""Gone With the Wind the same way after ""12 Years a Slave a brutally powerful and emotionally devastating film that takes great pains to rip any lingering vestiges of romanticism from Americas most shameful institution. You might be able to shrug off even the lurid depiction of slavery in ""Django Unchained to some extent as a cartoonish Tarantino fantasy. But ""12 Years does not flinch from showing the most horrifyingly graphic details of Solomon Northups struggle to survive in a hellish pre-Civil War Louisiana which he documented in a remarkable memoir. Ejofor (left) and Michael Fassbender in ""12 Years a Slave.""Photo Francois Duhamel/AP Chiwetel Ejiofor is unforgettable as Northup whose journey is especially compelling because he begins it in 1841 as a free black man in Saratoga NY a talented violinist and respected member of the community. Tricked into traveling to Washington DC for a supposed job Northup awakens from a night of drinking chained up in a filthy cell where he has been stripped of his free papers dignity and even his name before being shipped to New Orleans to be sold into slavery. After a series of brutal beatings it becomes apparent to Northup that the only prayer he has of surviving -- let alone ever seeing his wife and children again -- is by hiding his past life especially the fact that he can write and read. Northups very education is a threat to the pernicious institution of slavery which has never been depicted with such unflinching ugliness in an American movie. Director Steve McQueen ( the British director of ""Shame) and screenwriter John Ridley spell out in unsparing detail exactly how plantation owners and overseers brutally maintained control over the slaves -- legally considered property and not people in the South -- who greatly outnumbered them. At one point Northup is disciplined by being strung up in a noose from a tree for hours his feet barely touching the muddy ground while plantation life goes on around him. This unsettling sequence occurs under the watch of one of Northup s more enlightened owners played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Things get far worse when Cumberbatch is obliged to sell Northup to the sadistic Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) who thinks nothing of rousing his exhausted field hands in the middle of the night so they can dance for his entertainment while accompanied by Northrup on the violin. Northup finds himself caught up in the middle of Epps ugly sexual exploitation of his top cotton-picker Patsey (a superb Lupita Nyongo) who pleads with Northup to end her life. Instead Northup is forced at gunpoint to whip Patsey nearly to death in a lengthy graphic and shocking scene that many audience members will be watching through their fingers. There are many striking moments (photographed by Sean Bobbit) and outstanding performances in this movie. Among the latter are Sarah Paulson as Epps vengefully jealous wife; Adepero Oduye as a slave who howls with grief after being torn from her children; Paul Dano as an especially cruel overseer; and Alfre Woodard as a former slave married to a plantation owner (Bryan Batt) who briefly rents Northup. There is also what amounts to an extended cameo by co-producer Brad Pitt as an itinerant carpenter from Canada who fruitlessly lectures Epps on the evils of slavery (the only preaching in a movie that makes its points far more tellingly by showing them). More important Pitts character a deus ex machina based on an actual person enables a cathartic happy ending -- at least for Northup and his family. The expression on Northups face conveys what would take reams of dialogue -- capping a tour de force by Ejiofor a British actor best known in this country for the film version of ""Kinky Boots. Unavoidably melodramatic and extremely violent at times because of its fidelity to Northups life this film can certainly be difficult to watch. But Id argue its absolutely essential viewing to understand the roots of the tortured history of race relations in this country. Well-meaning films like ""Lincoln and ""Lee Daniels The Butler merely scratch the surface compared to the deep and painful truths laid bare by ""12 Years a Slave. Its about time Scarlett OHara.

And then everything changes utterly (FOX SEARCHLIGHT) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 18 2013 at 507 AM updated October 18 2013 at 510 AM comments Our spiritual beliefs and the way they can be called upon or twisted around to affect every part of our lives. Our physical being and the torments we can inflict upon it out of pleasure or self-denial. These are the central concerns of British director Steve McQueen. His first feature ""Hunger"" featured a political prisoner deliberately starving himself into martyrdom. His second ""Shame"" showed a damaged man compulsively punishing himself with joyless high-risk sex. And now ""12 Years a Slave"" tells a completely different kind of story -- yet for fans of this new and talented director not an unexpected one. Because it is also about a prisoner and faith and punishment. But in this case the imprisonment is unexpected and the mortification strictly levied upon the hero by others. And the man is determined not to become a martyr but a survivor. And the film is once again remarkable. It is a sad fact of Hollywood movies that they often approach historical horrors from the point of view not of the victims but of appalled witnesses. Thats not a problem ""12 Years a Slave"" falls into. But what it does do smartly is make its saga relatable by drawing on a specific singular historical narrative - the tale of a free black New Yorker who in 1841 was kidnapped and sold into Louisiana servitude. It is a fascinating way into the story. Because although he suffered no more than the men and women taken from Africa Solomon Northup knew even more about what was being denied him. And he is far easier for modern viewers to identify with. In fact in 19th-century Saratoga Northup had a life many would envy today. He had a house and a family and money. He was well-respected in his community and treated without a whiff of condescension by the whites around him. Until he made the mistake of taking a trip South -- and woke after a drunken (or drugged) night to find himself in chains. McQueen who began his career as a visual artist keeps his camera steady and close and while that has the benefit of helping disguise budgetary constraints it also makes things intimate and real. This does not feel like some contrived tear-tugging effort. This feels like life. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Northup and he helps to keep things rooted in reality too. His emotional responses -- disbelief then horror then guile -- are completely convincing. Does he have to lie and smile in order to survive? Then he will lie and smile. But the supporting actors and John Ridleys script also show the many true faces of slaverys cruelty. Paul Giamattis trader is of course an obvious villain buying and selling human flesh. More complex and even more loathsome is Michael Fassbenders plantation owner who flogs his slaves without mercy then wakes them up in the middle of the night to dance or to take him into their beds. Yet the most fascinating of all is Benedict Cumberbatchs character a planter and slaveowner who is also a minister and preaches the gospel on Sunday to the people he will then treat like property for the rest of the week. Fascinating because he really thinks hes a good man living according to the Bibles precepts. And its that kind of disconnect -- not the utter depravity of truly vicious villains but the ability to justify the most appalling inhumanity -- that allowed slavery to take root and grow. Yet as horrifying as the film is McQueen remains always calmly in control. In one scene Northup is nearly lynched then left dangling literally within an inch of his life. Slowly choking he hangs from a tree straining to keep at least his toes on the ground and support his weight to keep the noose from closing tight. N.J.

Behind him meanwhile life goes on. Slaves come in and out of their quarters. Overseers ride to the fields. The sky darkens. And the camera unmoving simply watches. The way so many people simple watch so many times that injustice is being done. But Northup did survive that day and many more like them; survived to write the book which gives this film its title and allows it to end on a note if not of hope than of survival. Not that the film -- with its scenes of brutal tortures and a heartbreaking performance by Lupita Nyongo as a particularly abused ""favorite"" -- is in any way sugarcoated. Its a violent disturbing film and often difficult to watch. Far more difficult than the vastly gorier -- and vastly less serious exploitive -- ""Django Unchained."" But then holocausts should never be easy to watch -- or easy to turn away from. Ratings note The film contains graphic gore violence sexual situations nudity alcohol abuse and strong language. 12 Years a Slave (R) Fox Searchlight (132 min.) Directed by Steve McQueen.

Maybe not that much - filmmaking like slavery is a global enterprise - but I guarantee you that someone somewhere is working on a blog post (or 20) about how this movie is a sinister Commie campaign to undermine the greatness of America. Were already seeing the kinds of Internet comments that reflect widespread unease with the subject matter Jeez enough negative ""black movies"" already; whats with all the angry race-baiting; cant we move on to the 21st century and its world of bland post-racial cliches and so on.Still its striking that the most direct confrontation with the crushing brutality of American slavery ever seen in mainstream cinema was directed by Steve McQueen (born in London of West Indian ancestry) who previously made ""Shame"" and ""Hunger"" and stars Chiwetel Ejiofor (also born in London of Nigerian ancestry). Its most important white roles belongs to the German-born Irish actor Michael Fassbender McQueens longtime collaborator and rising English star Benedict Cumberbatch (also seen this week playing Julian Assange in ""The Fifth Estate""). It may be that Americans of all races are still reluctant to confront this brooding historical specter that continues to haunt us or want to engage with it only in the cartoon version presented by Quentin Tarantino in ""Django Unchained."" (Im very mixed on that film by the way - there Are flashes of remarkable insight amid the spaghetti-western revenge fantasy. But the overall effect is to frame the reality of slavery as genre violence and so push it further away.)I should mention that the screenwriter of ""12 Years a Slave"" the veteran TV writer and crime novelist John Ridley is an African-American from Milwaukee and more important that his source material is one of the most important American slave narratives of the 19th century. Solomon Northup (sometimes spelled Northrup or Northrop in the historical record) played by Ejiofor in the film with tremendous slow-burning internal power was a real person whose extraordinary odyssey into slavery and back out again made him famous in the years leading up to the Civil War. While its impossible at this distance to verify every detail of Northups story theres also no reason to doubt its general outlines which were reported in this New York Times story from 1853 and subsequently investigated by numerous historians.Northup was a free-born ""colored citizen"" a part-time musician and laborer who lived in Saratoga Springs N.Y. with his wife and two children in 1841 when a pair of white men he didnt know invited him to New York City and then to Washington to play the violin with their traveling circus. The nations capital was a dangerous place for free black people at the time. The ""slave catchers"" who hunted runaways in the city and sent them back to the slave markets and plantations of the Deep South were not above abducting free people and thats what happened to Solomon Northup. As difficult as this is to imagine it appears thats what his circus employers had in mind all along. They got him drunk - possibly slipping him the 19th-century equivalent of a date-rape drug - and sold him to a Washington slave trader named James Birch (Christopher Berry in the film) perhaps under the premise that Solomon was really a fugitive slave from Georgia.This early portion of McQueens ""12 Years a Slave"" is a straightforward period piece but from the moment we first realize that Solomon is imprisoned in a slave pen within sight of the United States Capitol the film builds its nightmarish throbbing intensity. This is the story of an institution so toxic so poisonous that its tentacles can reach all the way to the Northup familys apparently idyllic life in the bourgeois comfort of upstate New York where their white neighbors and friends treat them with almost exaggerated decency. Slavery corrupted everything it touched black and white large and small from ordinary life in the boondocks to the streets of the capital and while it was an institution found at one time or another in every society and every historical epoch it reached its full and noxious flowering in 19th-century America the nation that claimed a special relationship with the divine and a unique heritage of universal liberty and equality. You Might Also Like James Birch decides he must break Solomon of his repeated insistence that he is not a runaway Georgia slave but a free man from New York. But the traumatic beating administered in that Washington slave pen meant to ""season a man to his condition"" (a phrase found in historical advice pamphlets for slave owners) is far from the worst trial that awaits Solomon. He will pick cotton and cut sugar cane he will shuffle and look downcast and pretend not to know how to read and write he will address illiterate and incompetent white men as ""master"" he will survive an attempted lynching and do nothing while he watches other men lynched who do not survive. But as harrowing as all that sounds McQueen and Ridley (unlike Tarantino) never go a millimeter beyond known events and highly plausible scenarios. This is a story of survival and endurance in the face of atrocious and dehumanizing conditions not a dose of medicine or masochism or sermonizing.Nor does this film depict white people in the antebellum South - or the small minority of whites who owned slaves that is -- as uniquely evil or sadistic. Thats not the point and might even be the opposite of the point which is more that slavery perverted everyone and everything. Cumberbatch for instance plays a plantation owner called Ford Solomons first Southern master who believes himself to be an enlightened and progressive man. He does not beat his slaves encourages them to pursue their own endeavors and immediately recognizes that Solomon (or Platt his slave identity) is a man of unusual talents. But Fords self-image is a lie and despite his immense material privilege he is almost as shackled as Solomon. The human kinship these two men think they feel - Solomon is understandably eager for it -- is no match for a social and cultural institution that insists one of them is a beast of burden and the other his proprietor.This films heart of darkness -- not an idle comparison by the way -- arrives when Solomon is sold to a cotton planter called Epps (Fassbender) who rules with the Bible in one hand and the cat o nine tails in the other and who has embraced the perverse logic of slavery to its fullest extent. He reminds me of the depraved Italian aristocrats in Pier Paolo Pasolinis horrifying allegory of fascism ""Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom"" and I wouldnt be surprised if McQueen has that parallel in mind. Fassbender gives a ferocious outsized yet highly believable performance as a Nietzschean superman of the bayous from whom money power lust and whiskey have stripped all morality. While Im not remotely suggesting that we should feel pity for this monstrous character Epps puts me in mind of Robert E. Lees revealing (if profoundly racist) remark that slavery in his judgment was ultimately more damaging to whites than to blacks. Debased and demoralized as he is - and even forced to perform unspeakable cruelties -- Solomon retains some human dignity some aspirations for a better future. It is Epps rather than Solomon whom the institution of slavery has reduced to the level of an animal. Although the major roles in this wrenching moral drama are male Lupita Nyongo plays a crucial role as Patsey the star cotton-picker on Epps plantation whom he has repeatedly raped and brutalized but has never completely broken. Indeed after his own deeply disturbed fashion Epps loves Patsey certainly more than he loves his embittered wife (the terrific Sarah Paulson) an ambiguous character who crackles with passion sublimated into madness and sadism. My own reading of the situation is that shed like to do with Solomon just as her husband does with Patsey but such erotic options were not really available to a plantation wife trapped in her cocoon of comfort. Solomon is redeemed from slavery in the end through the improbable agency of Brad Pitt as a Canadian carpenter. (The title of the film I suppose is a spoiler.) But ""12 Years a Slave"" offers no false Hollywood catharsis along with its muted happy ending because were not free from the curse of slavery yet. Looking at it the way it really was is a start.

"Review McQueens 12 Years a Slave impressive and hard to watch - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review McQueens 12 Years a Slave impressive and hard to watch Review 12 Years a Slave Kenneth Turan reviews 12 Years a Slave starring Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Fassbender Benedict Cumberbatch Paul Dano and Brad Pitt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews 12 Years a Slave starring Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Fassbender Benedict Cumberbatch Paul Dano and Brad Pitt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic When a director who never ever blinks takes on a horrific subject a nightmare in broad daylight is the inevitable result. Welcome if that is the right word to the world of ""12 Years a Slave.""Based on an 1853 memoir detailing the appalling experiences of Solomon Northup a free man of color who was brazenly abducted and sold into slavery this film intends to do more than tell us a story. It wants to immerse us in an experience and it does. Obviously no film can re-create the unspeakable degradation of one human being owning another but in making the attempt ""12 Years"" insists we feel things in a particularly oppressive way. This is impressive filmmaking but it is not easy to take in.PHOTOS Scenes from 12 Years a Slave British director Steve McQueen working from a screenplay by John Ridley has no intention of making audiences the slightest bit comfortable with this terrible story no interest in putting in any special pleading to bend our hearts.A former video artist who won Britains prestigious Turner Prize for artists under 50 McQueen wants us to experience these horrors as intensely as he does as intensely if it comes to that as Northup did himself.Viewers of McQueens previous films will not be surprised by any of this by the unflinching way for instance it depicts the details of savage whippings the slaves endure. Both ""Hunger"" about the grueling hunger strike of the IRAs Bobby Sands and ""Shame"" about the pain of sexual addiction share this films implacable style.All three of McQueens works also share a second element the irreplaceable acting of Michael Fassbender who made a huge impact as the star of ""Hunger"" and has formed a powerful aesthetic bond with his director at least as tight and productive as the celebrated link between Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. WATCH Envelope Screening Series -- 12 Years a SlaveBefore we get to Fassbender however ""12 Years"" introduces another exceptional actor Chiwetel Ejiofor who plays Northup. Impressive in films such as ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and ""Children of Men"" Ejiofor is a supple actor whose subtle work conveys the mind-bending notion of a man born free but hijacked into slavery a man who finds the keystones of his identity ripped away from him possibly never to return.Because the arc of Northups nightmare is revealed in the title of both the film and the memoir it is a special challenge for ""12 Years"" to involve us in specific ups and downs given that we know how it all ends.Potent performances across the board make that happen. Whether its established folks like Ejiofor Fassbender and producer Brad Pitt (in a key cameo that helped get the film made) or relatively new faces such as Lupita Nyongo and Adepero Oduye everyone fits smoothly into the deliberate pace of McQueens measured and solemn direction.Though Northups memoir is strictly chronological Ridleys screenplay shrewdly starts us in the middle of the story with Northup well into his new identity as Platt the slave deep in the bayous of Louisiana. At night he shares a moment of desperation with a female slave that offers a kind of relief but ends only in increased despair.PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013Once ""12 Years"" has shown us this vignette it is doubly shocking to flash back to Platts life when he was Northup a free man in Saratoga Springs N.Y. with a wife and two children and an apparently steady source of income as a fiddler. ""Stay safe"" his wife says as she heads off to a multi-week job as a cook. They are the last words of hers he will hear for quite awhile.A chance meeting with a pair of seemingly upstanding white men who offer him the chance of employment leads to a trip to Washington D.C. which ends with Northup being drugged and awakening chained in a slave pen with no one to appeal to and savage beatings assured every time he insists he is not a runaway. This is the classic ""wrong man"" theme raised to an unendurable level.Except Northup now renamed Platt has no choice but to endure it. Especially disturbing is the casual but complete dehumanization he finds being a slave means with slave trader Freeman (an excellent Paul Giamatti) offering him and others for sale with a casual ""what catches your fancy inspect at your leisure.""Platts first master William Ford (the ever-present Benedict Cumberbatch) is relatively enlightened by slave owner standards but even he can only do so much when Platt gets into a bitter dispute with a thoroughly racist overseer (an adept Paul Dano). No one inside the system can escape its corruption and its power.Edwin Epps Platts next owner is altogether different. A notorious and psychotic slave breaker Epps superbly acted by the fearless Fassbender is the absolute ruler of a disturbing alternate universe of his own devising one characterized by his alternating passion for and disgust with the slave Patsy (Nyongo) his sexual chattel as well as the best field hand on his plantation.Effectively shot by McQueens longtime cinematographer Sean Bobbitt on several real Louisiana plantations ""12 Years"" explores a number of odd corners of the slavery situation like the slave Mistress Shaw (Alfre Woodard) who is married to the plantation owner and serves an elaborate tea on Sunday mornings. Though he insists to himself ""I will not fall into despair"" this proves increasingly difficult for Platt as the unimaginable things he has to do to survive mount almost beyond understanding. Uncompromising to the end ""12 Years"" insists on saying to us this was how it was deal with it.--------------------------------- 12 Years a SlaveMPAA rating R for violence/cruelty some nudity and brief sexualityRunning time 2 hours 14 minutesPlaying At ArcLight Hollywood; Cinemark Baldwin Hills; Landmark West Los Angeleskenneth.turanlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Michael Fassbender Social Issues Reviews Benedict Cumberbatch Children of Men (movie) Paul Giamatti Paul Dano 12 Years a Slave Steve McQueen on shooting a pivotal scene Scenes from 12 Years a Slave On the Set Movies and TV Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad73deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-12-years-a-slave-movie-review-20131018,0,6001424.story?track=rss",200,12yearsaslave27,12yearsaslave,latimes

The film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt. VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT October 17 2013Set mostly in the pre-Civil War south director Steve McQueen has fashioned a deeply evocative and brilliantly acted drama that graphically and poetically depicts the wide-ranging evils of slavery.Chiwetel Ejofor stars as protagonist Solomon Northup in 12 Years A Slave.(Photo Jaap Buitendijk Fox Searchlight)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Fassbender Paul Giamatti Benedict Cumberbatch Brad Pitt Sarah PaulsonRated R; Runtime 2 hours 13 minutes; opens Friday in select cities 94 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMOREThe harrowing 12 Years a Slave is a mesmerizing period drama for the ages.Based on a true story Slave ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday in select cities) has probably the finest cast of any film this year. Heading the list of stellar portrayals is the masterful performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup a cultured black man living free in upstate New York who in 1841 is abducted and sold into slavery. Subjected to appalling cruelty for a dozen years Northup perseveres.""I dont want to survive"" he proclaims movingly when urged to keep his head down and work uncomplainingly. ""I want to live.""Thoroughly convincing as a violinist and family man whose world is far removed from the Southern cotton fields he is thrust into Ejiofor is a consistently dignified presence whose performance must certainly figure into the Oscar running.STORY Toronto loves 12 Years a SlaveMORE Slave stars react to all that Oscar buzzFIRST LOOK A sneak peek at 12 Years a SlaveREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThe film is based on Northups memoir and director Steve McQueens deliberately paced style ideally suits the material. McQueens juxtaposition of intensely savage scenes with lush natural beauty interlaced with ambient sound is a disturbingly vivid filmmaking choice.McQueen who made 2011s Shamecreates one of the most graphic portrayals of slavery ever depicted on screen. A long scene in which Northup dangles from a tree with a noose around his neck one foot grazing the ground as other slaves work around him is particularly searing. It also symbolizes the precarious position Northup is in throughout his enslavement.Tricked by a couple of hustlers into leaving his New York home Northup believes he is going to Washington D.C. to perform in a concert. He wakes up in chains in a dank cellar the papers proving his status as a free man stolen. Soon hes transported to the deep South with a falsified identity branding him as a runaway slave from Georgia. Sent to Louisiana he toils for three different slave owners.Northup doesnt endure his sudden hardship without forging essential human connections notably with Eliza (Adepero Oduye) whose young children are brutally taken from her and Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) the industrious young worker repeatedly raped and beaten by a slave owner.Northup cant reveal his ability to read or write for fear that hell incite the ire of the ignorant folks he works for. But his background as a craftsman draws the admiration of a slightly more humane slave owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) who protects him from a murderous overseer (Paul Dano).Northups non-servile ways also incur the wrath of Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) a particularly vicious and deranged slave owner and his sadistic jealous wife (Sarah Paulson).Born in the Adirondack Mountains Northup is determined to survive in his new surroundings steeling himself as others around him grow dead-eyed weep disconsolately or resort to suicide.Over the long years his determination to return to his wife and children in New York keeps him going. He wont give in to hopelessness. But the audience despairs for him after he makes a few failed attempts to get word to his family.A chance meeting with Canadian abolitionist Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt) changes Northups life.Just as Northups 1853 memoir shrewdly exposed a detailed view of slavery to the American public McQueens film offers contemporary audiences a meticulous and haunting look at this terrible chapter in American history. 94 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1aSO4UcFall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

Fox Searchlight By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Oct. 17 2013 111 p.m. ET Movie audiences have never been presented with anything quite like the intertwined beauty and savagery of ""12 Years a Slave"" so its anyones guess whether theyll extend the embrace that Steve McQueens film deserves. Such is the power of this landmark event though that it seems certain to transcend the movie realm and become a new reference point in contemporary culture--a defining vision of what slavery looked like and felt like in the U.S. before the Civil War. Its a sun-scorched vision of hell that puts Hieronymus Bosch in the shade. At the same time--and heres the genius of the production and of John Ridleys script--its a thrilling tale of survival based on a celebrated 1853 memoir by Solomon Northup. A free black man living happily and prosperously with his wife and children in Saratoga N.Y. Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is pulled into a nightmare world when he is abducted by bounty hunters in 1841 then shipped off to a plantation in Louisiana as a slave in shackles and chains. Movie audiences have never seen anything like the intertwined beauty and savagery of ""12 Years a Slave"" which could make or break the movie. WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern offers his take. Photo Fox Searchlight. At first the educated sweet-spirited victim doesnt realize whats happening to him but hes brought all too quickly to understand the ruthlessness of slave traders who treat the men women and children they sell as talking livestock--""My sentimentality"" says a pitiless trader played by Paul Giamatti ""extends the length of a coin""--and the inhumanity of plantation owners who buy them. ""There is no sin"" says one owner Edwin Epps a lust-addled Scripture-quoting brute played by Michael Fassbender. ""A man does how he pleases with his property."" Like its source material ""12 Years a Slave"" is a polemic and a furious one. How could it not be given the physical horror and moral squalor of the society it explores? Solomons agonies--the lashings the capricious beatings--are barely endurable for him and a test of our willingness to bear witness even though its hard to turn away from the astonishing range and impassioned conviction of Mr. Ejiofors portrayal. A slave named Patsey (Lupita Nyongo in another of the films brilliant performances) endures even more terrible punishment at the hands of Epps whose tortured sexuality leads him to rape her ritually and to have her whipped until the flesh falls from her back. The polemic is also a work of art. Mr. McQueen was a visual artist before he became a filmmaker and he and his cinematographer Sean Bobbitt give us a succession of images that seem discovered rather than devised. (In one extended excruciating sequence that Ill describe obliquely so as not to diminish its impact Solomon touches his toes to a patch of mud like a dancer performing a life-or-death gavotte.) The artistry extends to the heightened almost literary language spoken by the slaves among themselves and occasionally to their masters; its a choice that could have fallen into affectation but serves to honor inchoate feelings that might otherwise have gone unexpressed. Yet Mr. Ridleys exemplary script gives everyone his intricate due. The white men and women who inhabit the film arent all undifferentiated monsters--one can imagine them being tender with their children and generous to their friends--and those of them who perpetrate the most flagrant evil are anything but banal. Mr. Fassbender shines however malignantly as the worst villain of the bunch. Epps is the lethally serious counterpart of the jovial monster played by Christoph Waltz in ""Django Unchained"" and one more reminder that villainy in drama is its own reward. Benedict Cumberbatch is Ford a plantation owner with a paternalistic bent; he recognizes Solomons intellectual and musical gifts and treats him reasonably well but still sees him as a valuable piece of property. Paul Danos overseer Tibeats is terrifying for his invincible stupidity. Watch a clip from the film ""12 Years a Slave."" Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup a free black man from upstate New York in the antebellum United States who is abducted and sold into slavery. (Photo/Video Fox Searchlight Pictures) As an emblem of plantation societys contradictions Alfre Woodards Mistress Shaw is serenely almost surreally charming; a black woman and former slave she is married to a white plantation owner. Brad Pitts Bass is the antithesis of evil a Canadian abolitionist who may be the least convincing character in the film because he shows up out of nowhere and delivers the scripts only lapse into didacticism. Thats easy to forgive on three counts though Mr. Pitt is perfectly fine in the role; as one of the producers he was instrumental in getting ""12 Years a Slave"" to the screen; and the abolitionists message of equality is a worthy one. ""Your story is amazing"" Bass tells Solomon gravely ""and in no way good."" The film is amazing and in every way good. All Is Lost This is one of those films you either buy into right away or dismiss as a stunt. I bought in--much to my surprise since it promised to be a stunt--and far from feeling any remorse I grew more invested as the going got rough. Watch a clip from the J.C. Chandor film ""All Is Lost."" After a collision with a shipping container at sea a resourceful sailor (Robert Redford) finds himself staring his mortality in the face. (Photo Daniel Daza Video Roadside Attractions) The going gets exceedingly rough in J.C. Chandors existential thriller with Robert Redford as a solo sailor struggling to survive in the vastness of the Indian Ocean after his yacht collides with an errant shipping container. Thats the cast thats the plot No back story for the unnamed yachtsman; no dialogue apart from a brief and affecting preface plus a very few words en route; no tiger no mystical or religious subtext. The only thing we know the sailor believes in is celestial navigation which he uses after the failure of his boats electronics in an effort to maneuver into shipping lanes where he stands a chance of being rescued. ENLARGE Robert Redford in All Is Lost Roadside Attractions What engaged my interest at first was the staging of the collision no setup no drama just a bang in the night and a gouge in the fiberglass hull that presages disaster. But ""All Is Lost"" amps up as its heros options dwindle. Its a meditation on mortality with remarkable resemblances to ""Gravity"" not to mention echoes of ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Its admirably crafted with a wealth of detail that illustrates the sailors resourcefulness. (Credit for the cinematography is shared by Frank G. DeMarco who worked above the water line and Peter Zuccarini who shot the underwater sequences.) ""All Is Lost"" is also a showcase for an understated yet mesmerizing performance. You cant help seeing Mr. Redford as the star he has been over so many decades. At the very same time though you see him as the sailor suddenly vulnerable yet ferociously determined to live. The actor has become vulnerable too. At 77 he looks more or less his age. He has the rugged face of someone who has spent too much time in the sun. His golden hair has lost its backlighted glow. Yet Mr. Redford gives his character a formidable physicality. He is said to have done almost all his own stunts and clearly enhanced his performance in the process. As bruised and battered as the sailor becomes he is youthened by the struggle hes unlikely to win. Its all strangely but genuinely stirring. The Fifth Estate ENLARGE Daniel Bruhl left and Benedict Cumberbatch DreamWorks Benedict Cumberbatch is Julian Assange the WikiLeaks founder in a tale of the digital age that scores a dubious analog triumph. Mr. Cumberbatch brings an intriguingly creepy ambiguity to the role but the style of the film directed by Bill Condon is analogous to its subject torrents of inscrutable info about a man whose self-appointed mission has been distributing torrents of hitherto-secret data. Watch a clip from the film ""The Fifth Estate"" based on real events that reveals the quest to expose deceptions and corruptions of power that turned an internet upstart into the centurys most fiercely debated organization. (Photo/Video Dreamworks) The title refers to an emerging paradigm that differs from that of the traditional Fourth Estate. Now a single person with a computer and Internet access can be his or her own editor-publisher on a global scale. Mr. Assange is a prominent exemplar of this new journalism or whatever one chooses to call it and of its perils; an Australian citizen hes currently holed up in London in the Ecuadorian Embassy which has granted him political asylum. But Josh Singers diffuse script based on one book by Daniel Domscheit-Berg and another book by David Leigh and Luke Harding chooses to avoid any judgment of its heros conduct and omits any political or ethical context in which he might be placed. Instead ""The Fifth Estate"" gives us an obsessive-compulsive messiah with a taste for martyrdom and full-screen cascades of computer code in place of a coherent plot. Exhausting in a new way the movie is a data dump devoid of drama.

Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday October 17 2013 Follow AnnHornaday The opening scenes of ""12 Years a Slave"" Steve McQueens searing adaptation of the true-life account of a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the pre-Civil War South tell you all you need to know about the cinematic experience youre about to have. A lush unnerving tableau of a group of black men being taught to cut sugar cane reminds viewers of McQueens gift for evoking atmosphere and stark highly charged emotion whereas a scene that follows -- in which the protagonist Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) attempts to write a letter home with the juice of a few berries -- brings viewers into intimate contact with a place and time too often rendered as distant and abstract. Intense unflinching bold in its simplicity and radical in its use of image sound and staging ""12 Years a Slave"" in many ways is the defining epic so many have longed for to examine -- if not cauterize -- Americas primal wound. But its also a crowning achievement of a filmmaker whose command of the medium extends beyond mere narrative and its reductive sentimental snares to encompass the full depth and breadth of its most expressive and transforming properties. ""12 Years a Slave"" isnt just a cathartic experience that happens to be an astonishing formal achievement It works its emotional power precisely because its so elegantly constructed from the inside out. From those unsettling initial scenes ""12 Years a Slave"" flashes back to 1841 when Northup a relatively prosperous musician is living with his wife and children in Saratoga N.Y. While his family is out of town Northup is introduced to two self-described talent scouts who assure him he can get good work as a fiddler with a traveling circus. After a trip to Washington and a night of wine and dining Northup wakes up in a holding cell shackled by chains and enshrouded in heavy unremitting silence. What follows is a journey of unimaginable suffering and horror a sort of anti-picaresque during which Northup is beaten for insisting that hes a free man then bought and sold and bought again finally landing at a plantation owned by the merciless Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Much of ""12 Years a Slave"" centers on Northups relationship with Epps who is smart enough to know he should be threatened by his enslaved servants superior intellect and sense of culture -- and who processes those conflicting feelings the same way he accommodates his sexual attraction to a field worker named Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) with escalating and increasingly psychotic violence. (Eppss methods of annihilation extend to the subtle as well such as when he casually leans on his servants as if theyre pieces of furniture or wooden fence posts.) But ""12 Years a Slave"" which McQueen directed from a courtly admirably economical script by John Ridley isnt content simply to be an index of human cruelty. Rather the film offers a panorama not just of the African American experience in the antebellum South -- from the inconsolable wailing of a woman separated from her children to a former slave contentedly ensconced as the wife of her former owner -- but of the varieties of racist pathology. White audience members may find it impossible to identify with the sadistically extreme abuse perpetrated by Epps and his own desperate and cruel wife played in a chillingly good performance by Sarah Paulson. But what of William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) one of Northups more benevolent owners and his passive paternalism? The challenge in presenting oppression within the traditional grammar of feature films is that the director winds up aestheticizing violence or keeping it at a safe deniable distance. McQueen solves this problem by refusing to blink or at least knowing precisely when to allow his audience to do so. As he did in the films ""Hunger"" and ""Shame"" (also starring Fassbender) McQueen doesnt go in for a lot of flash edits or self-conscious visual flourishes to put viewers at ease; rather he invites the audience to sit with him as he gazes amazed at mans inhumanity to man an unnerving encounter that in this case is heightened by a percussive adamantly non-period musical score by Hans Zimmer. Whether the filmmaker is holding his camera on Northup as he struggles on his tiptoes his neck caught in a lynching noose while the life of the plantation deliberately goes on behind him or an excruciatingly protracted whipping scene the net effect is less an indictment of slavery than a far more nuanced portrait of the violence intimacy obsession and constant psychological contortions that defined its most toxic enmeshments. At it most profound though ""12 Years a Slave"" is a captivating study in humanity at its most troubled and implacable as Ejiofor masterfully portrays Northups fight to retain his dignity and identity within an ever-widening nightmare. As such McQueens film deserves pride of place alongside ""Gravity"" ""Captain Phillips"" and the upcoming ""All Is Lost"" as a breathtaking ambitious essay on physical and existential isolation. Arguably the stakes here are higher not just for Northup but for the viewers who find themselves caught up in his wrenching journey. Its improbable that anyone will feel lighter after watching ""12 Years a Slave"" but theyre likely to find that their moral imaginations have been newly liberated.     R. At area theaters.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 17 2013 327 PM Title 12 Years a Slave Film Info Lincoln Plaza Empire 25 Union Square. Sometimes you have to prepare yourself for the journey a film takes you on. So it is with ""12 Years a Slave"" a harrowing unforgettable drama that doesnt look away from the reality of slavery and in so doing helps us all fully truly confront it. Seen first in director Steve McQueens film are the empty eyes of a group of slaves preparing to work a field. They then sleep crushed together in a small room. Among them is Solomon Northup (British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor) who had another life. In 1841 Northup was a free man earning a good living as a musician in Saratoga N.Y. When his wife and two young children leave for a trip Solomon is approached by two strangers claiming to be businessmen seeking a violinist to perform in Washington D.C. He drinks and dines with them then awakens in chains captured by slave traders. He is beaten and though plotting an escape is shipped South to be sold. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup during his life as a free Northerner in ""12 Years a Slave."" Renamed ""Platt"" Northup is bought at a grotesque ornate auction by a conscientious land owner Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). But a run-in with Fords cruel overseer (Paul Dano) necessitates Northups being sold to work the plantation of the unhinged Epps (Michael Fassbender). As Northup learns to survive -- his identity his humanity stripped away -- he hopes to get word to his family in the North. McQueen allows everyday violence and degradation to seep into the film slowly. By the time Northup is nearly hanged by standing all day unacknowledged with a noose around his neck as the ground sinks beneath him -- with slaves and foremen blankly passing by -- the commonplace barbarity is sickeningly apparent. Lupita Nyongo (l.) as Patsey and Alfre Woodard as Mistress Shaw in ""12 Years a Slave."" Exemplars of the monstrousness are the drunken Epps and his cruel wife (Sarah Paulson). Epps is obsessed with his young slave Patsey (heartbreaking newcomer Lupita Nyongo) telling his jealous wife hed divorce her before hed sell Patsey. Then Epps sits unflinching as Patsey is beaten during late-night dances in which the exhausted slaves forced decorum is a macabre echo of the affairs Northup once performed at. John Ridleys deft well-structured screenplay balances moments of terror with telling glances of Northups sad resignation. Hans Zimmers music underscores gently or at times jarringly a symphonic suggestion of being caught in a machine. Through it all Ejiofor (""Children of Men"") Nyongo and Fassbender (star of McQueens 2011 ""Shame"") are astonishing. Paulson Dano and Paul Giamatti make gruesome villains while Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt playing a Canadian laborer offer glimmers of light. Lupita Nyongo pleads with plantation owner Michael Fassbender as Chiwetel Ejiofor looks on in ""12 Years a Slave."" The film hints that Northup -- whose 1853 memoir the film is based on -- had an apparent disregard of the reality of slavery before his abduction. Yet his journey into its horrors becomes our own. In showing them McQueen has made a film comparable to ""Schindlers List"" -- art that may be hard to watch but which is an essential look at mans inhumanity to man. It is wrenching but ""12 Years a Slave"" earns its tears in a way few films ever do. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews 12 years a slave chiwetel ejiofor benedict cumberbatch paul dano michael fassbender sarah paulson lupita nyongo Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

CAST Chiwetel Ejiofor Lupita Nyongo Michael Fassbender LENGTH 214 You may think you know what to expect from a movie titled ""12 Years a Slave."" Beatings lynchings rape and all the brutalities we associate with American slavery are here. None of it feels familiar however because this time it feels as though its happening to you. ""12 Years a Slave"" is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) a free black man in upstate Saratoga who in 1841 was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Within hours Northup went from a well-dressed member of society -- a wife two children a career as a violinist -- to a subhuman beast of burden. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? What follows is more than just a litany of horrors. ""12 Years a Slave"" works on so many levels -- some topical some timeless -- that its almost impossible to count them. Its an adventure movie a hostage tale a white-knuckle thriller a story of triumph. Above all its a work of astounding artistry and relentless moral force. After years of movies about slavery from 1977s television landmark ""Roots"" to last years cathartic ""Django Unchained"" its easy to get desensitized to the topic. Not here. Thats partly the result of Northups freeborn perspective which forces viewers of any color to step into his skin and to Ejiofors understated performance as a man desperately clinging to dignity. Michael Fassbender as a sadistic Christian named Epps and Lupita Nyongo as his brutalized slave Patsey bring vivid life to the movies topsy-turvy morally insane world. Coloring in the backdrop is a terrific cast including Paul Giamatti as a heartless auctioneer Sarah Paulson as Epps spiteful wife and Brad Pitt as a rare voice of conscience. But the real driving forces are the deeply insightful script by John Ridley and the austere formalist direction of Steve McQueen (""Hunger""). The movies painterly beauty (the cinematography is by Sean Bobbitt) and highly effective use of sound -- not just Hans Zimmers ominous score but the ghastly noises of human suffering -- will stay with you for days. 229 Movies12 Years a Slave trailer Watching ""12 Years a Slave"" its impossible not to think of Nazi Germany the Republic of Rwanda and other distant places where human beings somehow descended into madness.

Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff -- TWO BRITS VIEW OF AMERICAN SLAVERY It took two Brits -- the London-born son of Nigerian parents (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and a director whose parents were West Indian (Steve McQueen) -- to make a definitive movie about slavery in America. ""My parents are from Granada where Malcolm Xs mother was born. And my mother was born in Trinidad where Stokely Carmichael who coined the phrase Black Power is from"" McQueen says. ""Slavery wasnt just about shipping black slaves to North America. My ancestors were dropped off along the way to America. It was a global trade with repercussions and former slaves settling all around the world. Part of that diaspora is my story."" MoviesMust-see movies for 2013 Ejiofor 36 was equally drawn to the story McQueen felt compelled to tell. ""My family comes from the southeast of Nigeria the Igbo Tribe"" he says. ""I was in Nigeria shooting another film before making 12 Years a Slave. The last stop I made before heading out was to the slavery museum in Calabar. You see the roll call of people hundreds of thousands of them taken out of Calabar. The next day I took a flight to Louisiana the same place many of them were sent.

More News 12 Years a Slave Is Best Picture Bait Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> You heard me. 12 Years a Slave starts its true story in 1841 when Solomon Northup (British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor) a violin player living free in New York with his wife and children gets tricked into a job in Washington D.C. and then winds up as human chattel in the Deep South. Solomons memoir was published in 1853 eight years before the Civil War. Ancient history? Only if you believe that freedom has lost its fragility in the modern world. McQueen a conceptual artist born in London to West Indian parents sure as hell doesnt. His cinematic gut punch looms like a colossus over the Mandingo-Mammy-fixated drivel that passes as muckraking in Hollywood. Working with African-American screenwriter John Ridley McQueen makes it impossible to regard slavery from the safe remove of TV screens (Roots) Hollywood sugarcoating (Gone With the Wind) and Tarantino satire (Django Unchained). This prickly renegade restores your faith in the harsh power of movies. You dont just watch 12 Years a Slave. You bleed with it share its immediacy and feel the wounds that may be beyond healing. As Solomon Ejiofor gives an electrifying engulfing performance that will be talked about for years. The educated Solomon is forbidden to protest his situation or even articulate it. Not without being beaten or worse. But Ejiofors eyes deep pools of confusion pain and barely repressed rage tell us all we need to know. Want proof that acting can be an art form? Here it is. McQueen following the lead of his first two features 2008s Hunger about IRA prisoners starving themselves in protest and 2011s Shame about sex addiction works in long fluid takes that defy the trend toward smash-and-grab. The dividends are enormous. We are with Solomon every step of the way after he is renamed Platt Hamilton by a slave trader (Paul Giamatti radiating evil charm) and sold to plantation owner Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) a Bible reader. Unfortunately Fords benign approach is not matched by boss Tibeats (a creepy-scary Paul Dano) who baits Platt until the slave beats him senseless. Stringing Platt up on the nearest tree Tibeats is persuaded to halt until Ford returns. During that wait Platt still hangs his toes brushing the ground just enough to prevent his neck from snapping. McQueen draws out the lynching in excruciating detail showing plantation life going on in real time as Platt struggles to stay conscious and alive. The sequence a microcosm of the neglectful world outside is stunningly realized as we hold our breath along with Platt. Things only get worse when Platt is sold to cotton-plantation owner and self-proclaimed ""nigger breaker"" Epps (Michael Fassbender). Epps is a drunk who uses Scripture to justify his sadism with a whip. He taunts his wife (the excellent Sarah Paulson) by repeatedly raping Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) a slave girl who movingly begs Platt to drown her. In a staggering sequence Epps forces Platt to whip Patsey until her slender back is literally in shreds. But even here when the script skirts melodrama the Oscar-caliber portrayals stay fully dimensional. Nyongo from a Kenyan family is a spectacular young actress who imbues Patsey with grit and radiant grace. And Fassbender who starred in McQueens Hunger and Shame works miracles by revealing shards of feeling inside a monster. Fassbender is a raging bonfire who cuts to the core of a film that shows how slavery dehumanizes the oppressor as well as the oppressed. When Platt finally meets Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt) a Canadian carpenter who helps engineer his escape there is little relief. Tranquilizing nostalgia is not for McQueen who sees racism still festering in so-called polite society. Proving himself a world-class director McQueen basically makes slaves of us all. It hurts to watch it. You wont be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What we have here is a blistering brilliant straight-up classic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet To hear some tell it perhaps hyperbolically but with real conviction 12 Years A Slave may be the definitive cinematic treatment of American slavery. Rarely its true have the cruelties of the antebellum South been so thoroughly catalogued. Steve McQueen the British video artist who made Hunger and Shame spares his audience little. In retelling the harrowing true story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a free black man kidnapped and sold into the plantation system circa 1841 McQueen meets the atrocities of the era head-on. His unblinking gaze settles not only on oozing lacerations--the barbaric handiwork of the overseers--but also on the dehumanizing spectacle of people trotted out like cattle of children torn from the arms of their screaming mothers and of a slaver forcing himself in the dead of terrible night upon his ""property."" Viewers who avert their eyes wont escape as hearing the sickening slap of leather against skin invariably accompanied by a bellow of pain is just as disturbing as seeing it. If there was any doubt that this is a horror movie Hans Zimmers score pounds and roars with dread--the appropriate soundtrack for the madness of history. Deeply and unsentimentally 12 Years A Slave delves into the unpleasant details of Northups 1853 memoir taking a few dramatic liberties along the way. Yet its more than just a litany of sorrows the ultimate slavery movie its already been dubbed. Channeling the evils of human bondage through the experiences of one weary figure McQueen has constructed another intensely physical character study about a man trapped in his own flesh. However while Hunger and Shame found the director looking upon his subjects from a certain remove his interest devoted more clearly to surfaces than psychology 12 Years A Slave erases the emotional distance between him and his protagonist. Though still enamored of long takes McQueen no longer seems obsessed with the perfection of his images; hes instead found a story--an episodic one headlined by a complicated victim/hero--in which he can truly invest. That makes this wounding historical drama at once the richest and the most conventional of the filmmakers features. Spanning a dozen hardscrabble years with a few achingly sad flashbacks meted out along the way the plot finds Northup--a husband father of two and gifted violinist living in Saratoga New York--falling prey to a pair of traitorous opportunists who force him into the clutches of a Washington D.C. slave trader. Stripped of his identity the former free man (rechristened Platt) is soon bounced among plantations in Louisiana. His first owner Mr. Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) seems about as upstanding as one could expect a slaver to be lavishing compliments (and a fiddle) upon his suspiciously learned new slave. Of course the mans decency has limits When Northup rebels against a petty sniveling carpenter (Paul Dano earning his most deserved beating since There Will Be Blood) Mr. Ford saves his slaves life but denies him his freedom trading him to a notoriously cruel counterpart rather than take a loss on the purchase. Through this story strand 12 Years A Slave punctures the romantic myth perpetuated by Gone With The Wind and its ilk of the kindhearted slave-owner. ""The plague of the Pharaohs is but a poor sample"" says Alfre Woodards favored slave mistress ""of what awaits the plantation class."" Theres more eloquence where that came from Screenwriter John Ridley who penned the WWII-flyboy melodrama Red Tails displays a knack here for flavorful 19th-century vernacular. His script gains a new dimension of terror and psychosexual drama once Northup ends up in the cotton fields of sadistic drunkard Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender McQueens mercurial muse) who constantly yanks his slaves into the middle of bitter spats with the missus (Sarah Paulson). Proving yet again why hes one of the most exciting actors working today Fassbender transforms his character into a compelling human monster--a figure for whom malice and affection are intrinsically entwined as they were for Ralph Fiennes terrifying Nazi commandant in Schindlers List. Theres a subplot the movies most devastating about a young girl Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) forced to bear both the lecherous advances of her master and the violent jealousy of his wife. Her ordeal rivals Northups for sheer nightmarishness and Nyongo seems to carry the full weight of this national trauma on her frail shoulders. But the true standout of the cast peppered with fine unknowns and a few too many star cameos is the actor at its center. In a remarkably nuanced performance Ejiofor portrays a man at war with his very humanity. To survive Northup must suppress traces of his past--his way with words his fierce intelligence--and embrace his future as an anonymous field hand lest the oppressors learn the dangerous secret of his origins. That conflict provides 12 Years A Slave with its dramatic backbone as Ejiofor slips further and further into hopelessness (and the role of Platt) as the years blow by. Theres poetry in his struggle enhanced by a director attuned for once to the emotional states of his characters. For all the hardships he starkly depicts McQueen knows just when to slip in an image of overwhelming metaphoric beauty--for example the raspberry juice that streaks down the side of a bowl pooling at the edge like leaked tears spilled blood or the ink that could provide Northup with his impossible freedom. 12 Years A Slave is all about sea change and not just for its unfortunate hero. Before everyones eyes a visual virtuoso has transformed into a great storyteller.

Comments (3) click to enlarge 12 Years a Slave Recommended Video Rated R  133 minutes  2014 Based on a true story this commanding drama by Steve McQueen (Hunger) is the most uncompromising movie about American slavery Ive ever seen which might have something to do with the fact that McQueen is black and almost every other filmmaker to tackle the subject has been white. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Solomon Northrup a free man from Saratoga Springs New York who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841. Aside from a northern abolitionist (played by Brad Pitt) who arrives very late in the story there are no comforting white characters; the slave holders are at best high-minded souls who fail to act on their principles (Benedict Cumberbatch as Northrups guilt-ridden first owner) or at worst relentless sadists (Michael Fassbender as a pious plantation owner whose lust for one of his slaves is indistinguishable from his savagery toward her). Slavery here is not only a great moral darkness but a sweeping canvas for depicting the emotional deformities of the people who enforced and exploited the practice. Among the first-rate cast are Lupita Nyongo Paul Giamatti Scoot McNairy Paul Dano Sarah Paulson and Alfre Woodard. By J.R. Jones See our full review Year in review 2013 at the movies J.R.

The story it tells a true one is horrifying In 1841 Solomon Northup a free educated black man from Saratoga New York was kidnaped sold into slavery and transported to Louisiana. His captivity lasted 12 years. To survive he had to hide the fact that he could read and write which prevented him from contacting not just his wife and children but also any of his friends in the North who might have helped him. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Northup recounted his story in 12 Years a Slave a piercing memoir published in 1853. The title alone is austere and direct almost painfully elegant and that must have been the effect McQueen was going for too. His interpretation of 12 Years a Slave is beautifully shot (by Sean Bobbitt) contrasting the all-too-visible evil of mankind with the occasional ribbon of pretty sky peeking through the Louisiana trees. The story is told with calm clarity its pace stately and respectful in accordance with its subject matter. John Ridleys script hews closely to the language and details of Northups book. Michael Fassbender Paul Dano and Paul Giamatti all render their services in villainous roles playing respectively a twisted slave owner a megalomanic murderous overseer and a sleazy slave trader. Its all so perfect so right.But is there any blood in its veins? 12 Years a Slave is a pristine aesthetically tasteful movie about the horrors of slavery. Aside from a characteristically nuanced lead performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor--plus an oak-tree-tall supporting one by Benedict Cumberbatch as well as a breath of movie-star vitality from Brad Pitt in a very small role--its a picture that stays more than a few safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty as it often does it never compromises its aesthetic purity. In one scene Fassbenders creepy plantation owner forces Ejiofors Solomon to whip a female slave who has sneaked away to a neighboring plantation for a bar of soap. The camera moves slowly in a partial arc the shape of a comma It takes the measure of the grisly brutality of the scene and of Solomons anguish without really breathing it in. The moment is terrible yet it comes off as weirdly antiseptic history made safe through art.Film Details 12 Years a Slave RatingR GenreDrama Running Time133 More Info Thats a style a choice. Filmmakers--the best ones at least--think and feel through images and the artisanal remoteness of 12 Years a Slave isnt such a surprise when you consider McQueens two previous features Hunger a beautifully controlled picture about Bobby Sandss hunger strike and death and Shame a meditation on sex addiction thats as obsessive and single-minded as a lady-killer looking for his next conquest. McQueen who is also a video artist has a superb sense of composition and he always knows just how and where the light should hit. In an early scene in 12 Years a Slave Solomon after being deceived and drugged wakes up in chains locked in some dungeon-like room. Contrasted with the inky blackness around him the billowy white shirt hes wearing practically sizzles; small parcels of light glint off his iron chains giving off a matte dull glow. Its an image of great visual beauty. And it looks like art direction.Theres no reason a movie dealing with an ugly subject should be ugly itself. And there is an upside to that remoteness McQueen isnt out to punish or scold us with his filmmaking. Northups story is anguishing and McQueen seeks only to tell it; he knows theres no need to bludgeon us. But compared with Lee Danielss The Butler a movie about another angle of the African-American experience 12 Years a Slave is buffed to a dry prestigious sheen. You could go to a European cocktail party and profess your love for it without having to apologize. Try doing that with The Butler a messier movie with an unapologetic pop sensibility--it features a supporting turn by Oprah after all. Its not nearly as pretty but its alive.12 Years a Slave works so hard to be noble but it doesnt have to Ejiofor is there to do all the heavy lifting. Too often stuck playing astrophysigeologists in Roland Emmerich movies Ejiofor brings all his gifts to bear here. His subtlety is the earth-moving kind He could probably shift a mountain just by arching an eyebrow. Northups book is written in the slightly formal manicured language of a well-educated man yet its directness is heart-stopping. ""I was heart sick and discouraged"" he wrote describing his despair after suffering the first of many brutal beatings. ""Thoughts of my family of my wife and children continually occupied my mind. When sleep overpowered me I dreamed of them--dreamed I was again in Saratoga--that I could see their faces and hear their voices calling me. Awakening from the pleasant phantasms of sleep to the bitter realities around me I could but groan and weep."" 12 Years a Slave takes the spirit of that prose and arranges it with painstaking distracting care for the camera. Ejiofor carries it inside him hidden. And still the light shines through.Follow VoiceFilmClub Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcast Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

The ultimate cruelty of humanity is tested to the perimeters of hell in 12 Years a Slave a true story about the ugliest and most shameful chapter in American history. This gut-churning endurance test about a free man of color who was kidnapped and sold into slavery for 12 unspeakable years is so harrowing that any viewer with a weak stomach is cautioned ahead of time as a public service Whole sections of 12 Years a Slave may be too unbearably wrenching for even the bravest soul to watch. But the impact is so profound that it would be a crime to miss it. The word most often used to describe it is ""brutal"" which seems to be a pattern for British artist-turned-director Steve McQueen. His first film Hunger centered on the emaciating physical torture behind bars endured by IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands followed by the ferocity of sex addiction in Shame. Both films starred Michael Fassbender and as a favor to the director who made him a star Mr. Fassbender now appears in the smaller but no less challenging role of a sadistic amoral plantation owner who beats slashes whips and hangs his slaves regardless of age or gender. But the centerpiece of the film is the great Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup a successful and respected musician and family man from Saratoga N.Y. who accepted a job in 1841 to play the violin for a traveling circus managed by a group of con-men who made a living by drugging kidnapping and selling into bondage every Northern black man woman and child they could capture and ship by boat to the slave markets in the South. Unable to convince anyone of his freedom and education Northup was shackled beaten ferociously robbed of his identity as a free man and passed around from one black-hearted slave trader to the next. Thus begins a 12-year saga of survival. Unable to fight back or tell anyone who he was Northup concealed his intelligence and was forbidden to admit he could read and write for more than a decade in order to avoid suspicion and stay alive. There are times during this depraved memoir of relentless violence and degradation adapted by John Ridley from a forgotten book by Northup published in 1853 when I wondered if I would make it myself. Screaming children are ripped out of their mothers arms and sold at auction. A man dangles at the end of a noose hanging from a live oak tree on tiptoes that are sinking in mud. A beautiful girl is whipped unconscious in a pool of blood. Yet Mr. McQueen manages the impossible feat of averting sentimentality while Mr. Ejiofor opts for pride and dignity over rage telling volumes with his deep dark expressive eyes. Hes a riveting actor chalking up stunning performances as diverse as the African immigrant selling illegal body parts out of a London hotel in Stephen Frearss Dirty Pretty Things and the original Lola the flamboyant drag queen who saves a hapless shoe factory from bankruptcy in Kinky Boots. But 12 Years a Slave is the film that will guide him to stardom. He is more than ably supported by an impressive cast that simmers and boils in supporting roles including Mr. Fassbender as the savage creature who believes slaves are chattel; Sarah Paulson as his beautiful but barbaric wife; Alfre Woodard as a former slave who now lives in luxury as the wife of a white plantation owner; Lupita Nyongo as a younger slave who is constantly bludgeoned and raped by Mr. Fassbender; and arriving heroically near the end Brad Pitt as an abolitionist carpenter. None of these characters are simple Harriet Beecher Stowe caricatures. As Northups first owner British actor Benedict Cumberbatch vastly superior here than he is in The Fifth Estate and more coherent too even with a Southern accent at least plays one plantation owner who is not terminally evil. Mr. Fassbender makes something complex out of his villainous role one minute forcing Northup to pick 200 pounds of cotton per day or face a lynching the next minute reading scriptures from the Bible to slaves and white family members alike.  Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt who shot both of Mr. McQueens previous films finds beauty bordering on insanity in every sunny moss-covered lane and every shadowy column of the Louisiana plantation locations. And the juxtaposition of lush greenery and filthy slave-cabin deprivation is hair-raising. If the best films hold you in a captive vise entertain you keep you spellbound and teach you something at the same time then 12 Years a Slave is outstanding--brave courageous and unforgettable. 12 YEARS A SLAVE Written by John Ridley Directed by Steve McQueen Starring  Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael K.

By David Denby Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup in Steve McQueens new movie.   Credit Illustration by Concepcion Studios The most striking image in ""12 Years a Slave""--a film of many powerful moments and sequences--is of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a freeborn African-American kidnapped into slavery hanging from a tree with a noose around his neck and one foot touching the muddy ground. Behind him other slaves go about their labors--its a normal day on a Louisiana plantation in the eighteen-forties. Solomon was almost hanged for defending himself against an overseer; now hes left to dangle halfway between stability and annihilation. Thats essentially his situation for a dozen long years. The movie is based on a true story which Northup told in a book of the same title published in 1853. Born in the Adirondack Mountains in 1807 he becomes a violinist and lives a gracious life (which we see) with his wife and children in Saratoga Springs New York. Then a couple of top-hatted circus gents offer him a job playing on tour and one night in Washington D.C. they get him drunk. When he wakes up in the morning hes in chains in a foul hole. As hes taken out of the city by slavers the director Steve McQueen raises the camera to reveal the Capitol in the distance. After a journey by ship Solomon winds up on plantations in Louisiana where hes traded loaned out and at one point used as service for debt. Throughout he has the enraged consciousness of a free man. Yet he cant reveal much of his mind or his temperament without incurring the wrath of men and women whose self-esteem is based on the belief that hes an animal. What remains awake in his soul of a better life puts the moral condition of slavery in the harshest possible light. ""12 Years a Slave"" is easily the greatest feature film ever made about American slavery. It shows up the plantation scenes of ""Gone with the Wind"" for the sentimental kitsch that they are and intentionally or not its an artists rebuke to Quentin Tarantinos high-pitched luridly extravagant ""Django Unchained."" For McQueen who comes out of the London gallery-and-museum world of short films and videos the movie is an enormous step forward. ""Hunger"" (2008) his first feature was a kind of sacerdotal monument to Bobby Sands and other I.R.A. prisoners who staged a hunger strike. The movie which starred Michael Fassbender was marked by a fetishistic absorption in beatings self-denial the disintegration of the body. His next feature ""Shame"" (2011) also starring Fassbender was a sexually explicit folly about the utter hell of being a single straight handsome well-employed young white male in New York. Both movies were staged as austere rituals. But now McQueen has opened himself up to society history and narrative. There are expertly composed short scenes set in Saratoga and at various slave-trading posts on the journey to Louisiana. McQueen and his screenwriter John Ridley might have done more with the minor characters that Northup encounters--Paul Giamatti as a fussy slave broker Alfre Woodard as a cynical plantation mistress--but they move on fast. Northups kindly but hapless first owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) protects him for a while but is forced to pass him to the sadistic Edwin Epps (Fassbender). At Eppss plantation crested by a large house with columns Solomon gets caught in an anguished sexual tangle involving Epps; his beautiful field slave Patsey (Lupita Nyongo); and his calculating wife Mary (Sarah Paulson). The filmmakers drive the scenes toward a frenzy of humiliation loathing and savage beatings. McQueen spares us nothing of the horror of human dignity betrayed by base everyday cruelty. If theres a weakness in these scenes its a reliance on the mesmerizing Fassbender. Epps is so far gone into psychosis that theres nothing Fassbender can do but repeat his outbursts with greater hysteria. For a while the movie becomes a redundant moral and physical struggle between a noble forbearing African-American and a white madman. Yet there are scenes and shots staged and photographed with such sober beauty that I will never forget them in Washington the men and women about to be shipped south standing naked in a yard and washing themselves; the dripping woods and the languor of Louisiana in summer; Chiwetel Ejiofors face--square jaw furrowed brow eyes appalled by a situation in which Solomon is forbidden to demonstrate exactly what in his own eyes makes him a man. Northup is a gentleman of mild disposition easy to like; anyone who has ever feared losing everything will identify with him. But the movie leaves us grieving for the thousands who never knew freedom who were never able to tell their stories for future generations. This fall season human adventure and daring in all its natural glory circles the globe and even beyond. (Comic-book heroes for the moment seem to be nesting in disconnected bits waiting to rise again.) Theres ""Gravity"" with Sandra Bullock dangling above the beautiful Earth; ""Captain Phillips"" with Tom Hanks trying to outfox Somali pirates on the high seas; and now ""All Is Lost"" with Robert Redford as a lonely yachtsman drifting around the Indian Ocean. ""All Is Lost""--the title is a line from a farewell letter that Redfords character writes--echoes such literary classics as Stephen Cranes ""The Open Boat"" and Hemingways ""The Old Man and the Sea."" But ""All Is Lost"" which was written and directed by J. C. Chandor is unimaginable as anything but a movie. Its largely wordless sombrely spectacular vast and intimate at the same time with a commitment to detailed physical reality that commands amazed attention for a tight hundred minutes. We know nothing about this weathered man in his sailboat--a thirty-nine-foot yacht--and we never learn anything about him except that he likes to be alone on very long trips. ""I think you would all agree that I tried"" he writes presumably to his family in the movies prologue. ""I will miss you. Im sorry."" The time frame then skips back eight days. As the sailor sleeps in his cabin the absurd crashes into his life a floating steel shipping container which apparently slipped off the deck of a passing freighter makes a hole in the side of his craft. The container is carrying sneakers; a few of them dribble into the ocean a small staple of consumerism impinging on a solitary man in the middle of nowhere. Philosophers speak generally of that able fellow homo faber man the creator. Redford (as Ill call him; the sailor has no name) is both homo faber and homo fixit. His navigation equipment and his radio are rendered useless and he is seventeen hundred miles south of the sea lane known as the Sumatra Straits where he hopes he can be rescued. He sets about patching the hole in his boat pasting large strips of plastic over the opening caulking the edges--making his yacht seaworthy. And then sextant in hand he heads for the straits. The boat is assailed by weather and every kind of misfortune and Redford grows increasingly battered and hungry. Chandor who demonstrated a vivid talent for dialogue mood and characterization in the Wall Street meltdown movie ""Margin Call"" (2011) here displays an ability to furiously carve up and then integrate a confined space. Redford working every corner of his boat takes us back to the Inuit hunter Nanook in Robert J. Flahertys ""Nanook of the North"" (1922) methodically cutting a hole in the ice to catch a seal. The continuity of activity in sustained shots is the essence of the drama. All around the man occupied in his yacht the gray open sea is either still or swollen. Enormous storms flip the boat and Chandor evokes the strangeness of shipwreck--the boat hull in the air gets righted by another giant wave. As often as he can he creates an aura of mystery within the extreme materiality of his fiction. Why does Redford shave as a possibly fatal storm strikes the yacht? We can only guess that he wants to exert control in the maelstrom any way he can. Apart from Robert Redford water is the major actor here sloshing slopping pouring swelling cascading. Redford sleeps in it squats in it walks through it swims under it. The film wouldnt have been as moving with a man of say George Clooneys age; it wouldnt have had the nobility of endurance to the same degree. Now seventy-seven Redford is in great shape and the cheekbones and the jaw despite a wrinkled shell have held up--a visual sign of character surmounting age. He does more acting in this movie than he has done in all his earlier movies combined. The anxiety in his eyes as death approaches is unsettling since it may be something that Redford the man feels too. His movements become more spasmodic as the character grows weaker but hes still quick and capable. At one point Chandor gives us a heroic image of the sailor at the helm of his craft in the middle of the storm. Heroic but not hollowly iconic. The movie is too busy attending to Redfords next task. This is not a contemplative film even though it (inevitably) asks What does your existence mean? The answer You make meaning by doing.

By David Edelstein Published Oct 13 2013 ShareThis (Photo Richard Foreman/Courtesy of Roadside Attractions) In his late seventies Robert Redford has never held the camera as magnificently as he does in the survival-at-sea thriller All Is Lost and its not just because hes the only person in the movie. Its because solitude is his natural state. He plays an unnamed man forced to solve a series of increasingly urgent problems when a discarded shipping container in the middle of the Indian Ocean rips a hole in his yacht. Redford doesnt yammer like Sandra Bullock in this months other drifting-toward-doom picture Gravity. Apart from a farewell letter (read in voice-over) in the prologue he doesnt utter a syllable until the last twenty minutes or so. But Redford is one of the few actors who can think convincingly onscreen and the film is designed so that his thinking is the whole show. You watch his eyes flick back and forth as he takes the measure of the space ties knots drops sails and plots charts. You marvel at his equilibrium. And then you see how as his prospects darken his sense of masteryhis supreme self-containmenterodes how emotion finally rises to the surface. For once Redford stops thinking. See Also Redford on Going Solo As he proved in his debut Margin Call writer-director J. C. Chandor has a penchant for brainy procedural disaster pictures. Few of those make the imaginative leaps of great art but they can be enormously satisfyingand when theyre in sync with a stars personality penetrating. Redford looks craggy and weathered but thats been true since he started spending most of his time at 12000-plus feet above sea level on the slopes. In the ways that matter he looks younger onscreen than he has in a quarter-century. Full engagement will do that for an actorand the sad truth is that Redford is rarely engaged by other actors. He did gaze with love on Paul Newman and in The Way We Were that force of Jewish nature Barbra Streisand managed to rock his Waspy reticence like the storm surge does in All Is Lost. But in most other films he looks as if hes edging for the exit which is why he was such a nonstarter as Jay Gatsby He couldnt project a longing for the woman whod complete him. Here its that sense of self-sufficiency that will be testedmaybe unto death. All Is Lost is a parable and Chandor pushes it too far with the mans last decision The timing is bizarre and the framing too self-consciously mythical. But everything else goes swimmingly. All Is Lost can be classified as yet another piece of Motion-Sickness Cinema but for once the style is integral. The camera rocks with the creaks cracks and other sounds of encroaching disequilibrium while an actor in his element anchors your gazeand gives the performance of his life. Solomon Northups Twelve Years a Slave published in 1853 is an even-toned but acid account of unimaginable horror how in 1841 a pair of traveling showmen lured him from his home and family in Saratoga Springs New York with the promise of fast money in return for playing the violin; how they drugged and sold him to slavers in Washington D.C.; and how he quickly learned that assertions of his true identity only got him beaten harder. Northup has a roving intelligence and curiosity. He even stops to explain what cotton picking and sugar harvesting entail. His first master Ford was a kind noble Christian man who nonetheless never doubted the moral right of one man holding another in subjection. His final one Epps was an alcoholic and a psychopath. He is known Northup writes as a nigger-breaker distinguished for the faculty of subduing the slave He looked upon a colored man not as a human being but as mere live property no better except in value than his mule or dog. Steve McQueen the director of the wildly acclaimed adaptation 12 Years a Slave has a specialty He likes to fix his camera on a person in extremisstarving to death in Hunger shaming himself sexually in Shame and now being tortured by monstrous white slavers in the South. His shots are high-toned mythic frieze-dried. Theyre intended to induce claustrophobia physical and existential. McQueens images have considerable power and Id watch his films less guardedly if I thought he were searching for something more than his characters reactions to extreme degradation. In this case at least he has found a milieu in which a feeling of entrapment shouldand doespermeate every frame. See Also Chiwetel Ejiofor on His 12 Years a Slave Role The painterly malignancy is unrelenting. Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) stands in prison awaiting his sale and his white shirt glows like the central Inquisition martyrs in Goyas Third of May. As each new white character is introduced were apt to search his or her face for a sign of compassion or empathy only to be walloped by the general inhumanityas Solomon is literally walloped by a hitherto avuncular-looking Paul Giamatti. The benevolent Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) only half-rises to defend his slaves humanity before fearfully settling back into the status quo. But life is far worse when Solomon arrives at his final plantation the house of Epps (Michael Fassbender) and his Gorgon of a wife (Sarah Paulson) whose overriding goal is to see her husbands prized slave mistress Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) suffer. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Adapting the memoir by Solomon Northrup artist-turned-filmmaker McQueen (""Shame"" ""Hunger"") and screenwriter John Ridley (""Three Kings"" ""Red Tails"") seem determined to obliterate any lingering ""Gone With the Wind""-inspired notions that the antebellum South was a place of grace and charm or that slavery was in the euphemism of the day merely a ""peculiar institution."" Also read 20 Movies Were Dying to See This Fall ""12 Years a Slave"" may not reach the wide audience of ""Roots"" or have the mass cultural impact of that miniseries -- and with todays splintered media landscape probably nothing ever will -- but it packs as much if not more than a wallop with an R rating that allows for a heightened sense of violence and cruelty. Northrup (portrayed memorably here by Chiwetel Ejiofor) was a free man living in Saratoga N.Y. in 1841. Two smooth-talking producers (Scoot McNairy and Taran Killam) hire him to play violin for their traveling circus and when they reach Washington D.C. the showmen drug Northrup and sell him into slavery. Realizing that protesting his status will only get him killed he remains silent and is sold into servitude now going by the name of ""Platt."" Also read 5 Breakout Movie Stars of Fall Working first for mill-owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) -- whos smart enough to realize that Northrup wasnt born in chains but too in debt to the slave trader (Paul Giamatti) to say anything about it -- and then for cruel cotton grower Edwin Epps (McQueen regular Michael Fassbender) Northrup endures mental and physical abuse and hardship all the while nurturing an ever-dimming hope that he will be able to contact the outside world and regain his freedom. ""12 Years a Slave"" isnt as cool and dispassionate as McQueens earlier films and it doesnt indulge the directors penchant for long takes nearly as much but the results are no less intense. At times the material itself is so hard to watch -- Epps forcing Northrup to flay a fellow slave for instance -- that McQueen realizes that a few changes of camera angle arent going to make the scene any less challenging. Also read 5 Reasons 12 Years a Slave Is No Oscar Lock Backlash the Unseen and McQueen One of McQueens effective techniques is to keep the audio from one scene playing over the next as a chilling counterpoint. At one moment for instance a cruel overseer (Paul Dano) sings a creepy song of warning about what happens to slaves who attempt to run away and that song -- which just keeps going and going long after you wish he would stop -- starts playing over a church service being held for the slaves. That juxtaposition reminds us of the constant undercurrent of fear those slaves must have felt even during moments of supposed compassion from their exploiters. And while ""Hunger"" and ""Shame"" both revolved around relatively small casts of speaking characters McQueen creates a rich ensemble of performances here. Ejiofor guides us through this hell as deftly as Dante forcing us to behold events we dont want to watch all the while hoping for his survival and deliverance. Fassbenders Bible-thumping sadist registers -- as does Sarah Paulsons turn as his wife whos capable of both cruelty and compassion -- and performers like Giamatti Killam Alfre Woodard (as a masters high-living mistress) and ""Pariah"" star Adepero Oduye (unforgettable as a woman forcibly separated from her children) make an impact even when theyre only on screen for a scene or two. Certain awards prognosticators are somewhat prematurely handing everything to this film which I point out only because prizes tend to favor the heart over the head. (""The Kings Speech"" beating out ""The Social Network"" to give just one recent example.) McQueen and Ridley dont set out to pluck our heartstrings; they instead let this historical horror show unfold before our eyes and trust that we dont need to be told how to feel about it. Also read Director Steve McQueen on His Brutal 12 Years A Slave Its a Film About Love This approach mostly works although theres a big climactic moment in which ""12 Years a Slave"" suddenly wants us to get out our handkerchiefs; for a dry-eyed artist like McQueen this is a somewhat unexpected turn and a not entirely successful one. The packed critics screening I attended ended with lots of applause but only scattered sobs. Whether or not its festooned with trophies ""12 Years a Slave"" will endure as a powerful work of art and as a meaningful contribution to this countrys ongoing conversation (and frequent amnesia) about race. Its as difficult and harrowing as the material demands that it be. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Aug. 27 2013Confused by the vast cinema cornucopia offered at this months Toronto International Film Festival? To help you choose heres a selection of capsule reviews by Star movie critic Peter Howell movie writer Linda Barnard and entertainment writer Bruce DeMara. Ratings are out of four stars. Find screening times and other fest info at tiff.net.12 Years a Slave (4 stars) Believe the Oscar buzz. Britains Steve McQueen (Hunger Shame) nails the horror of Americas slavery shame but also finds humanity in one mans determination to free himself and return to his family. Chiwetel Ejiofor towers as title slave Solomon Northup a free New York State family man who is duped and taken hostage to the Deep South there treated as chattel and worse. Michael Fassbender terrifies as the slave owner out to break Northup and others. They lead a top-flight cast in a film sure to open minds as well as garner awards gold. Peter HowellAnimal Project (3 stars)Toronto writer-director and low-budget indie sweetheart Ingrid Veninger breaks pleasing new ground with a multi-layered story about small-time acting teacher Leo (Aaron Poole) and his diverse class. He urges them to discover the truth about themselves by donning theme park-style animal costumes and going out into the world. Turns out single-dad Leo at odds with his teen son (Jacob Switzer) may be the chief beneficiary. L.B.The Armstrong Lie (3 stars)If you thought you heard it all when disgraced cycling star Lance Armstrong spilled his doping secrets to Oprah then Oscar-winning doc maker Alex Gibney is here to set you straight. He unearths many more details and motivations behind Armstrongs illicit deeds including the multiple victims of his scams that few people know about. Originally planned to salute Armstrongs successes -- Gibney was a fan -- the film coolly shifts into expose mode. It gets repetitive and runs long at 122 minutes but Gibney gives the truth a full airing. P.H.The Art of the Steal (21/2 stars) The Canadian homage to star-studded 1960s art heist flicks like Topkapi has some amusing moments and sharp writing from Jonathan Sobol who also directs. The expansive cast includes Jay Baruchel Matt Dillon Kurt Russell Terence Stamp Katheryn Winnick and Chris Diamantopoulos. Nothing new here but it is fun; Baruchel is hilarious making a border crossing in a ridiculous disguise. L.B.Article Continued BelowBastards (21/2 stars) True to her flair for powerful images Claire Deniss latest opens with a naked and bleeding teen (Lola Creton) walking with a blank expression on Paris streets. How the girl got there is just part of a twisting non-linear (and occasionally infuriating) payback narrative of a family unravelling while a sleaze-ball businessman tugs at the threads. The most noteworthy thing isnt the pictures but rather the hypnotic soundtrack a vibrant club mix. P.H.Beyond the Edge (31/2 stars) Canadian-born New Zealand director Leanne Pooley makes audiences feel they are making the tortuous and historic climb of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay with her gorgeous film about the first men to reach the summit in 1953. Thrilling and dramatic Pooley couples rare archival footage and impressive dramatic recreation aided by both Hillarys and Norgays families. Screening in 3D. L.B.Blood Ties (2 stars) Good cop/bad con bros in 1974 Brooklyn makes for a fine clash between Billy Crudup and Clive Owens characters. But its a same old story of family friction co-written by James Gray with director Guillaume Canet (who co-starred in the 2008 French original Les Liens du sang). Marion Cotillard James Caan Lili Taylor and Zoe Saldana help crowd the cast of this cluttered story which wisely has 17 minutes trimmed from the overlong 144 of its Cannes 2013 bow. P.H.Blue Is the Warmest Color (31/2 stars)Tunisias Abdellatif Kechiche took home the 2013 Palme dOr at Cannes in May for this coming-of-age lesbian romance -- and deservedly so. In an unusual honour French actresses Adele Exarchopoulos 19 and Lea Seydoux 27 shared in the Palme citation for their passionate acting. Adapted from a graphic novel Blue is intense and deep enough to justify its three-hour running time. The sex is laid bare but so are the utterly believable emotions. P.H.Blue Ruin (3 stars) The title refers not only to a plot-driving rusted Pontiac Bonneville but also the dangerously depressed mental state of beach vagrant Dwight (Macon Blair superb) who is recklessly out to avenge a family tragedy. Writer/director Jeremy Saulnier (Murder Party) doles out clues with a deft touch also managing the cinematography with a steady hand. Ace genre entry makes sobering comments on Americas gun culture and payback mentality. P.H.Borgman (3 stars) Knock knock whos there? The devil you say? This chilling story about an insistent vagrant turned insidious home occupier played with implacable menace by Jan Bijvoet comes from Cannes 2013 via the scary mind of Dutch screenwriter director and actor Alex van Warmerdam. Think Lynch meets Haneke in an absurdist flick that maintains its state of dread without fully tipping its hand. Theres humour too as twisted as a graveyard chuckle. P.H.Can A Song Save Your Life? (2.5 stars) This modestly engaging story of a burned-out drunken music executive (a charming Mark Ruffalo) who hopes his discovery of pop-folkie Greta (Keira Knightley showcasing a thin yet earnest singing style) can turn his professional life around doesnt grab the heart with the intensity director John Carney managed with lovely Irish drama Once. Theres no memorable ""Falling Slowly"" type tunes although the boy-cant-have-girl plot is remarkably similar. Adam Levine of Maroon 5 plays Gretas hollow-hearted singing star boyfriend. L.B.Child of God (21/2 stars) Based on the novel by Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy actor/director James Franco looks at social isolation and the human condition through the eyes of Lester Ballard a poor Tennessee outcast driven to necrophilia. Francos abilities as a filmmaker are amply demonstrated and Scott Hazes performance as Lester is haunting if not particularly sympathetic. But this is a film that given the subject matter will court controversy as it struggles to find an audience. B.D.Dallas Buyers Club (3 stars) The triumph of the human spirit is whats really on offer in this AIDS drug drama by Jean-Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y. The Young Victoria). Set in 1985 its the fact-based story of a Texas rodeo cowboy (Matthew McConaughey) who refuses to go quietly when his high-risk lifestyle of sex and drugs puts him at deaths door. He starts importing unapproved drugs and vitamins from Mexico to illicitly treat himself and other AIDS sufferers making him both hero and felon. Script and pacing problems aside the film is an awards-beckoning showcase of McConaugheys ferocious talents matched only by his astonishing physical decline on-screen. Equally arresting is Jared Leto as his transgender sidekick who looks past the arrogance and homophobia of his unlikely friend to see the decent person within. P.H.Le Demantelement (3 stars) Gabriel Arcand (The Decline of the American Empire) delivers a commanding performance as a taciturn Quebec farmer and devoted papa who runs into trouble as he dismantles his rural life to protect his two daughters his ""princesses"" from perceived big-city threats. Writer/director Sebastien Pilotes compassion for the little guy also evident in his acclaimed 2011 debut Le Vendeur comes to the fore again in this down-to-earth heartbreaker. P.H.Devils Knot (21/2 stars) Twenty years and several documentaries after the horrific murders of three young Arkansas boys we still dont know the full story of what happened -- but we do know that three teens were wrongfully convicted in a modern witch hunt. Atom Egoyan focuses his dramatic lens on the case casting Reese Witherspoon as a grieving mom and Colin Firth as a conflicted investigator in a portrait of small-town secrets and guilt that begs comparison to the directors earlier The Sweet Hereafter. P.H.Don Jon (3 stars) Joseph Gordon-Levitts directing debut (he also wrote the script and stars) is a clever highly amusing look at sex love and the pervasive power of porn as seen through the eyes of Jon Martello Jr. a New Jersey bartender who loves the ladies but finds nothing compares with the buzz he gets from the gals on his computer screen. Enter demanding bombshell Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) a bridge-and-tunnel princess for the ages. L.B.Empire of Dirt (21/2 stars) Peter Stebbings (Defendor) directs this drama about three generations of aboriginal women haunted by a repeating past. Battling grandmother Minnie (Jennifer Podemski) and adult daughter Lena (Cara Gee) struggle to find enough peace between them to spare Lenas 13-year-old. Shes on the brink of repeating their mistakes. Newcomers Gee (a TIFF Rising Star) and Shay Eyre impress; Podemski is terrific as the matriarch. L.B.The F Word (31/2 stars) Director Michael Dowse (Goon Fubar) has done what many have tried without success a truly engaging and wholly entertaining Canadian romantic comedy. Toronto has never looked so good -- and plays itself -- in the story of med-school dropout Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe showing hes got a long career ahead) and ideal foil Zoe Kazan as Chantry who truly believe men and women can indeed just be friends. Sure they can. L.B.The Face of Love (3 stars) Co-writer/director Arie Posin delivers an unconventional story about love and loss featuring a memorable performance by Annette Bening as a grieving widow who -- five years after her husbands death -- encounters and embarks on a relationship with a man who is his veritable doppelganger. Ed Harris demonstrates both his trademark masculinity as well as a vulnerability that makes his artist character Tom appealing. The tension builds as we await the inevitable moment when Nikki and Toms world will come crashing down. B.D.Fat (3 stars) First-time feature filmmaker Mark Phinney takes an often-disturbingly honest look at what its like to be obese with an ultra-low-budget film based on his writings about his struggles -- both physical and emotional -- with weighing 300 pounds. Mel Rodriguez unselfconsciously plays the central character Ken with ferocity and plenty of righteous fury occasional tenderness and humour. It will break your heart. L.B.A Field in England (3 stars) Historical dramas dont normally come with warnings of ""flashing images and stereoscopic sequences"" but then weve learned to expect the unusual from Britains Ben Wheatley (Kill List Sightseers). His visceral muse takes him to a 17th-century pasture circa the English Civil War where a small group of deserters seek ale and freedom but instead find hallucinogens and the iron fist of a satanic treasure seeker (Michael Smiley). Mad monochrome mayhem thats utterly hypnotic. P.H.The Fifth Estate (21/2 stars) Bill Condon adopts the info-dump approach of his subject WikiLeaks for this TIFF opening gala combining elements of biopic thriller and didactic documentary for a story that engages the mind but sometimes slogs. At the heart of it is a sterling performance by Benedict Cumberbatch as brash WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who takes the ""publish and be damned"" ethos to 21st-century heights shaking world governments with revealed secrets and lies just a few clicks away. P.H.Filthy Gorgeous The Bob Guccione Story (21/2 stars) Playboys raunchier rival Penthouse has duked it out for eyeballs with such X-rated stunts as the infamous centrefold ""Pubic Wars."" Yet Toronto doc maker Barry Avrich bravely argues Renaissance Man status for late Penthouse founder Bob Guccione seen in archival footage and discussed by family and friends. Its a tough sell -- Gucciones gold chains and Caligula film foray scream sleaze -- but the porn kingpin was an arresting figure nonetheless. P.H.For No Good Reason (21/2 stars)Portrait of the artist as a young (and old) gonzo. Charlie Pauls approach to Hunter S. Thompsons illustrator/co-conspirator Ralph Steadman his pen as mighty as his ego wobbles between hagiography (especially when Johnny Depp is onscreen) and serious critique. The latter redeems the project. Steadman admits gonzo journalism had its ""mean face"" and that he and the late HST had issues (especially over matters of credit) but they also shared a weird kind of fraternal love. P.H.Gabrielle (3 stars) Quebecoise filmmaker Louise Archambault presents a modern conundrum -- how we as a society treat people with development challenges -- in a sweetly unpretentious love story. Gabrielle (played by Gabrielle Marion-Rivard) and Martin (Alexandre Landry) are members of a choir who are also trying to live independent lives. They also love each other to the consternation of others. Lovely performances bolster a story that confronts the issue with honesty and realism. B.D.Gloria (3 stars) Its easy to see why Chiles Paulina Garcia won top acting honours at Berlin 2013 for her portrayal of an uncompromising 58-year-old Santiago divorcee who grabs life with both hands. When Gloria meets Rodolfo at a singles dance sparks fly but his divorce seems to be in name only much to free-spirited Glorias annoyance. Filled with joy and lots of sex director Sebastian Lelio gives us a character to love with Gloria. L.B.The Grand Seduction (3 stars)A charming crowd-pleaser and a rare remake that exceeds the original. Don McKellars English version of the 2003 Quebec hit about a doctor-seeking village benefits mainly from an extraordinary cast. Irish actor Brendan Gleeson makes for a fabulous fabulist as leader of a Newfoundland fishing harbor willing to say and do anything to seduce the sawbones (Taylor Kitsch) they need to land a badly needed factory and jobs. Gleesons almost upstaged by the accomplice antics of our own Gordon Pinsent; the pair make this a grand production. P.H.Gravity (31/2 stars)Not since 2001 A Space Odyssey has a film sovividly and realistically transmitted the feeling of being lost in space. Alfonso Cuarons 3D lens captures the deepest blues of Earth and the midnight hues of space powerfully affecting the senses. The film also works on a purely emotional level with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney realistically depicting the plight of astronauts facing dwindling oxygen and rescue prospects after calamity strikes. Gravity isnt sci-fi; its a sky high. P.H.The Great Beauty (31/2 stars) La vita in Rome has been mostly dolce for author/journalist and ""King of the Socialites"" Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo). But as he reaches 65 life isnt quite so sweet anymore -- especially when he has to deal with a demanding stripper a gourmand exorcist a vanishing giraffe and other existential crises. Paolo Sorrentino conjures the great Fellini for this barbed boisterous and brilliant whirl through the Eternal Cityand one mans vivid mind. P.H.Hateship Loveship (21/2 stars) Alice Munros short story becomes a deliberately paced drama about shy reclusive housekeeper Johanna (Kristen Wiig) who is inexperienced in life and especially love. Shes hired by a crotchety grandfather (Nick Nolte) to help care for his teen granddaughter Sabitha (True Grits Hailee Steinfeld) and keeps her distance from the family while cooking and cleaning until a teen trick turns mean-spirited convincing Johanna that Sabithas drug-addicted widowed dad (Guy Pearce) has feelings for her. This page-to-screen Munro treatment isnt as successful as Sarah Polleys Away From Her but Wiig shows a pleasing new depth as a dramatic actress with a low-key performance of a woman who is a living anachronism. L.B.Horns (21/2 stars) Daniel Radcliffe stars as Ig Perrish a guy having a devil of a time convincing people he had nothing to do with the brutal murder of his angelic girlfriend (Juno Temple). His troubles only escalate when he wakes up with horns growing from his head. And why are people telling him all their deepest secrets? Its like they cant help but confess their sins of thought and deed. Director Alexandre Ajas adaptation of Joe Hills supernatural bestseller is stylish and often amusing -- in a good way -- and Radcliffe shows his strengths in a far different role from that of Harry Potter. A satisfying thriller but things veer into the silly when the snakes show up. L.B.How I Live Now (31/2 stars) Director Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland) delivers a tension-filled apocalyptic tale about lost innocence and the endurance of love with a standout lead performance by Saoirse Ronan as a brittle American teenager sent to live with British cousins just as a global nuclear war plunges society into anarchy. Great performances by the young cast in a story filled with terror heartbreak and ultimately hope. B.D.The Husband (3 stars) ""Try decaf"" a concerned relation tells angry cuckold Henry (Maxwell McCabe-Lokos) but its going to take more than this to calm him. His teacher wife (Sarah Allen) is in jail for bedding a 14-year-old student leaving Henry with their infant son and a jealous rage that burns hot. Director Bruce McDonald resists easy laughs although theres some dark comedy. Actor/co-writer McCabe-Lokos likewise stares down realitys ugly mug giving a performance hard and true. P.H.The Invisible Woman (31/2 stars) Dont let the title which makes it soundly vaguely sci-fi put you off. This film set in Victorian England tells the story of Charles Dickens -- a superstar in his time -- and the young woman who becomes albeit reluctantly his mistress. Ralph Fiennes both stars (as Dickens) and directs with an exacting eye to period detail and there are great performances across the board among them Felicity Jones as Nelly Ternan and Kristin Scott Thomas as her mother Catherine. B.D.Jodorowskys Dune(31/2 stars) It was the ""greatest movie never made"" an effort by Chilean-French avant-garde filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky to adapt the sprawling sci-fi novel Dune to the big screen in 1975. Director Frank Pavich rounds up Jodorowsky 84 and various players to recount the events almost 40 years later and its a fascinating informative and funny tale of hubris-fuelled failure. (Ironically director David Lynchs eventual 1984 version was an even greater failure.) B.D.Kill Your Darlings (21/2 stars) Daniel Radcliffe sheds his Harry Potter persona for good to play poet Allen Ginsberg (including his sexual awakening as a gay man and drug experimentation) in John Krokidass 1944-set drama about the birth of the Beat Generation writers and the mystery surrounding the murder of professor David Kammerer (a red-headed and bearded Michael C. Hall of Dexter). While Radcliffe is good all eyes are on Dane DeHaan as Lucien Carr. Wow. L.B.Labor Day (3 stars)Melodrama is the last thing youd expect out of Jason Reitman the acerbic observer of modern life but he takes to it like a teardrop to an eye duct in this irony-free adaptation of Joyce Maynards 2009 novel. Set in 1987 (but so 1950ish) Josh Brolin plays a con on the lam who takes a single mom (Kate Winslet) and her son (Gattlin Griffith) hostage none of them realizing at first that sometimes the heart is held prisoner too. Strong performances help make Reitmans mood shift a winner. P.H.The Last of Robin Hood (21/2 stars) Kevin Kline plays the one-time swashbuckling Hollywood hero and well-known womanizer Errol Flynn in his final vodka-marinated years when he fell for 15-year-old chorine Beverly Aadland (Dakota Fanning) with an assist from her stage-struck mother (Susan Sarandon perfect in Mama Rose mode). Was it true love or a dalliance of convenience? The Last of Robin Hood keeps us guessing in a picture that stays true to its late-1950s pedigree but its an often too straightforward ""then this happened"" biopic. L.B.Like Father Like Son (31/2 stars)Hirokazu Kore-Edas baby-swap saga a runner-up prize winner at Cannes 2013 brings global empathy to its local concern. When the parents of two 6-year-old Japanese boys learn their children were swapped at birth in the hospital they have to learn how to cope with radically altered families and lives. Its a situation any parent could identify with but rich vs. poor class distinctions intensify emotions in this superbly measured drama. P.H.Love is the Perfect Crime (3 stars) French filmmaking brothers Arnaud and Jean-Marie Larrieu have concocted a devilishly clever thriller starring veteran actor Mathieu Amalric as an aging professor of creative writing at a university in the scenic Alps who cant resist the many temptations thrown his way in the form of nubile female students. Hes also a chain-smoking somnambulist prone to blackouts during which dark and unexpected things happen. His relationship with his sister is also a little too close for comfort. Like the winding wintry road in the opening scene its a dark ride with hints of Hitchcock and dashes of sardonic humour. B.D.The Lunchbox (3 stars) A mixup by one of Mumbais army of lunchbox delivery men (dabbawalas) sets up writer-director Ritesh Batras deliciously low-key story of a pencil-pusher on the cusp of retirement (Irrfan Khan) who forms an unlikely friendship with a lonely young wife and mother (Nimrat Kaur) when he mistakenly gets the lunchbox she has filled for her husband. Notes tucked in among rotis reveal feelings about the world they have long kept hidden. Poignant but not sentimental the performances from the two leads impress. L.B.Only Lovers Left Alive (3 stars)Rock n roll will never die -- especially when its already undead.Indie hero Jim Jarmusch pairs a paler than ever Tilda Swinton with The Avengers Tom Hiddleston as a centuries-old supernatural couple grooving to their own weird heartbeat. These vampires live a louche life travelling the world and buying their designer blood from a hospital. As always with a Jarmusch film its about the scene not the story in this deadpan delight. P.H.The Past (3 stars) Misdeeds big and small combine with explosive impact on a Parisian family in Asghar Farhadis latest film which plays like a sequel to A Separation his 2011 Oscar-winning marital drama. Berenice Bejo (The Artist) and Tahir Rahim (A Prophet) star as a romantic couple who live together and may wed. But first they have to free themselves from other entanglements. Its a potent combination of quality directing acting and writing. P.H.Philomena (31/2 stars) Judi Dench is perfect as a working-class Irish senior who endured shame and heartache when she was shuttered in a convent as an unwed pregnant teen 50 years prior her young son taken from her by nuns who prevented all contact. Enter a former journalist (Steve Coogan) who has his own reasons for helping her find her lost child. Its a touching often funny and moving examination of ""faith"" in every sense of the word. Director Stephen Frears (The Queen) has a real crowd-pleaser with Philomena. L.B.Prisoners (31/2 stars)The first U.S. feature by Canadas Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) is a child kidnap thriller set in suburban Pennsylvania that uncoils with a serpents stealth -- and that strikes just as suddenly. Hugh Jackman is a desperate dad Jake Gyllenhaal a cop fighting the clock and vigilante justice; the two lead a strong cast that also includes Terrence Howard Viola Davis Paul Dano and Melissa Leo. A potent commentary on modern life and fears and a triumph for Villeneuve. P.H.R100 (1 star) Japanese comic turned director Hitoshi Matsumoto explores the nature of desire through the world of kink told through the eyes of a mild-mannered salesman who joins a club where he can be humiliated by a succession of dominatrixes. Shot through a sepia-tinged lens with flashes of pale pastels added later its a film designed to satirize modern Japan and to shock. (One particular scene will raise hackles.) Occasionally edifying mostly unsettling. B.D.The Right Kind of Wrong (21/2 stars) A failed writer eking out a living as a dishwasher (but man can he juggle) is love-struck by a beautiful woman on her wedding day in this quirky romantic comedy that is nearly too cute for its own good. Fortunately an appealing performance by Ryan Kwanten (True Blood) as lovelorn slacker Leo Palamino makes it work along with a hilarious cameo by Catherine OHara as the brides kooky mom. The script is smart despite a lot of juvenile hijinks. Set in and around Canmore Alta. the cinematography is stunning. B.D.Rush (3 stars) Youd expect a movie about Formula One racers to cut to the chase but director Ron Howard takes his time establishing the ego vs. egghead rivalry between 1976 top guns James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). When the engines really start the fact-based story locks in both as involving entertainment and as a serious look at what it takes to be a true champion. Highly commercial but also thoughtful and suspenseful. Do yourself a favour and dont Google the result prior to seeing. P.H.Salinger (21/2 stars) Dogged research and hero worship make an odd combo in Shane Salernos documentary quest for the late J.D. Salinger the misanthropic and publicity-averse author of The Catcher in the Rye the ultimate rebel tome. His 10-year trawl through Salingers closely guarded life gets repetitive since there are no known film interviews or audiotapes to draw on. Hes obliged to make heavy use of talking heads many of them famous actors declaiming their love of Salinger and his rebel character Holden Caulfield. Much of it amounts to variations on the misunderstood genius theme and the big reveal about unpublished books has already hit the headlines. Salerno does provide a fuller portrait of Salinger than weve ever seen before including his many women and the Second World War experiences that shaped his still-powerful prose. P.H.Sarah Prefers to Run (21/2 stars) Quebec actress Sophie Desmarais impresses as the fixated title athlete a young middle-distance sprinter struggling to balance love and life ambitions and rushing to unwise commitments. Writer/director Chloe Robichauds nicely realized feature debut Canadas main flag carrier at Cannes 2013 avoids the worst cliches of torn-by-choice dramas adding welcome dashes of humour. P.H.The Selfish Giant (3 stars)Not the Oscar Wilde childrens story more an inspired take on it in the kitchen-sink style of a Ken Loach drama.The tragedy of Britains underclass fatefully unspools in this sophomore feature by writer/director Clio Barnard (The Arbor) who guides casting finds Conner Chapman and Shaun Thomas to memorable performances as juvenile wire thieves who risk all for gain and greed. Barnard is as skilled at conventional storytelling as she was with the formal experiments of her debut. P.H.Siddharth (31/2 stars) Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta ably follows 2008s debut Amal with the moving beautifully lensed Siddharth about an impoverished Delhi family whose 12-year-old son disappears after his father Mahendra (Rajesh Tailang brilliant) reluctantly sends him away to work in a factory. Unable to get answers and amid rising fears he has been abducted Mahendra sets out to find the boy despite heartbreaking obstacles. L.B.The Square (31/2 stars) Director Jehane Noujaim succeeds in the impressive task of chronicling the tumultuous events in Cairos Tahrir Square -- a catalyst in the Arab Spring movement that has rocked the Middle East -- as seen through the eyes of real people from January 2011 up the present day which led to the toppling of long-time dictator Hosni Mubarak and that of president Mohammed Morsi on July 3. The contrasting moments of joy and heartbreak hope and despair cooperation and violence make this documentary a memorable experience. B.D.A Story of Children and Film (3 stars)Running just under two hours Mark Cousins film is nowhere near as comprehensive as his 15-hour The Story of Film An Odyssey but that doesnt stop the Irish documentarian from trying. Using clips from 53 films and 25 countries including E.T. The 400 Blows and TheSpirit of the Beehive (plus many rarer titles) Cousins shows how youthful energy and innocence have inspired all the worlds filmmakers not just Hollywood ones. A worthy sidebar to his earlier magnum opus. P.H.Tims Vermeer (3 stars) Where geekery meets artistry we find Tims Vermeer a doc directed by Teller silent partner of the magician-debunker duo Penn amp; Teller about their pal Tim Jenison. The Texan inventor devoted years to figuring our how 17th-century Dutch Master Johannes Vermeer painted his photo-realistic works more than a century before photography. Trying to replicate Vermeers The Music Lesson will prove his theory. The result astonishes. A fascinating funny and inspiring story. L.B.A Touch of Sin (3 stars)Fists are raised and pistols cocked in Jia Zhangkes dystopic and throbbing take on modern China. The winner for Best Screenplay at Cannes 2013 its an unusually active and brutal movie for a director previously known for his reserve. Erratically linked stories and characters depict the near anarchy of modern life in Jias homeland where unchecked capitalism is destroying tradition and civility. Jia shows slayings of every description yet he films through anger and sorrow. P.H.Tracks (3 stars) Mia Wasikowska plays Australian Robyn Davidson a loner who makes Greta Garbo look like an extrovert in John Currans beautifully lensed dramatic recreation of Davidsons 2700-kilometre trek across the Aussie desert in 1977 accompanied by her dog and four often ill-tempered camels. Adam Driver plays the National Geographic photographer whom she reluctantly allows to meet her every six weeks to chronicle the dangerous effort the price she has to pay for funding. L.B.The Unknown Known (3 stars) Oscar-winning docmaker Errol Morris (The Fog of War) gets as close as anyone ever has to looking behind the rictus smile and smug manner of Donald Rumsfeld the U.S. secretary of state during the worst years of the Iraq War. The question is whether the mission is worth it Rumsfeld comes across as so shallow self-serving and downright delusional its a bit of a trudge to sit through 96 minutes of the mans preening and posturing. The film cant help but suffer in comparison to the revelations of The Fog of War in which Vietnam-era defense secretary Robert McNamara offered candour instead of facile wordplay. P.H.Watermark (21/2 stars)Stark contrasts hit us off the top thundering water at a Chinese dam; desiccated land in a dead part of the Colorado River Basin. Elemental doc makers Jennifer Baichwal and Edward Burtynsky now co-directing artfully hop the globe to see and record mankinds use and abuse of our planets most precious resource. Its not the revelation that their earlier Manufactured Landscapes collaboration was but it seeks to inspire awe and reflection and frequently succeeds.

Share Tweet 0 Shares By Joshua Rothkopf Posted Friday September 6 2013 Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender in 12 Years a SlaveIts not too soon to call 12 Years a Slave a great film--ruined tremulously sad surreal in its evil. It does more than join the company of TVs landmark Roots; it eclipses it for nuance and psychological depth. Meanwhile were taken to a nightmarish vision of the antebellum American South a farmscape where over the movies multiyear saga ingrained attitudes creep all too slowly toward nobility. To call the movie a knockout is insufficient director Steve McQueen retains the oppressive moodiness of his Shame and Hunger (as well has his favorite actor Michael Fassbender playing an instantly iconic slave-owner capable of scary compartmentalization) and funnels everything into a conventional structure that delivers him to the top rank of storytellers. Too much gush? You havent sat in this dramas thrall heard the sobs and screams around you and known that an archetypal classic was being born. You will.RECOMMENDED Full coverage of the Toronto Film FestivalWhile last years Lincoln and Django Unchained took heat--unfairly--for addressing slavery in creatively oblique and irreverent ways 12 Years a Slave is no doubt the movie complainers wanted. Adapted from Solomon Northups unimpeachable 1853 account of his own abduction from a modest family existence in Saratoga Springs New York while on tour with a circus McQueens film delivers the fine-grain details of slave life--but its his keen eye for the smallest gestures of self-negation that really root things in horror. Early on we see the natty dignified Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor in a magnificent fiercely controlled turn) pointing to his young son to step smartly while walking down the street; its only a short amount of screen time before Northup himself drugged and sold into bondage is being instructed by another slave to keep quiet and to not reveal that he can read. (In one of the films first unnerving moments this new friend will later be seen happily jumping into his reclaiming masters arms at the dock submitting to a head rub like a lost dog.)Northrup is not so lucky (a relative term). Its best to consider McQueens triumph--and its subtle interior agenda--as a collection of moments that reveal nervous behavior. Taught how to shuck sugar cane the slaves quietly submit to a vicious taunting ditty (sung by Paul Dano one of the movies many white devils). No one sings along. In time Northrup is almost lynched for fighting back against this overseer but an intervention occurs--although hes left dangling by the noose his toes scraping the ground. For what feels like a good minute McQueen pulls back to a distance and we see the other slaves going about their jittery business too terrified to help him. Slavery is a condition of life in privileged Georgia but the conditioning takes time these scenes show (""Youll forget your children soon enough"" Liza J. Bennetts ominous matriarch tells a wailing new arrival).McQueen teases out the lunacy of it all via Ejiofors barely veiled amazement and a radical score by Inceptions tuba-blaster Hans Zimmer who uses synthesizers and percussive clangs to connote strangeness. The journey of the movie extends to three owners the last of whom Epps (Fassbender) represents a vicious creature of his culture attracted to a pretty slave who works hardest exploiting her sex while destroying her beauty. Like all the truly mighty movies theres a misstep or two Brad Pitts saintly Amish contractor is too good to be true building a gazebo while disputing ethics with the landowner. Still its a mark of McQueens complexity that he wants to include hope as a dangling fantastical prize. Its a quibble. Ive been obsessing about this movie for hours and cant quite believe it actually unspooled. Ferocious and inspired its a mandatory piece of historical reclamation--from a British director no less.Follow Joshua Rothkopf on Twitter joshrothkopf Share Tweet 0 Shares 0 Add comment Comments You might also like Chiwetel Ejiofor interview ""Race is an invention"" Game like a pro at Sands Bethlehem 10 travel tips every vacationer should know Shame (2011) directed by Steve McQueen and starring Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan (VIDEO) Night Across the Street New York Film Festival 2012 Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/toronto-2013-12-years-a-slave,200,12yearsaslave43,12yearsaslave,timeout

Nelson Mandela (Idris Elba) the subject of Justin Chadwicks Mandela Long Walk to Freedom might make the same observation about his 27 years of imprisonment in South Africa. Both fact-based dramas receiving their official world premieres at the Toronto Film Festival were directed by Englishmen (Chadwick white; McQueen black); the movies stars were born in London of African parents. Both movies are based on autobiographies Northups Twelve Years a Slave was published in 1853 Mandelas Long Walk to Freedom in 1994. Detailing the state-sanctioned degradation that white masters forced on their black subjects the two films could serve as harrowing edifying illustrations that America and South Africa allowed and encouraged such obscenities. Big difference though Mandela rushes through its protagonists adult life offering a CliffsNotes precis of the life of the lawyer and outlaw who compelled the Boer government to give equal rights to its black majority. In 12 Years a Slave McQueen immerses viewers in the magnolia-scented hell to which Northup was exiled. You will recoil at every whiplash feel each slur wonder at mans inhumanity to men and women he thought animals. Keith Bernstein / Weinstein Company Mandela means to be in the mold of Gandhi Richard Attenboroughs 1982 biopic that beat out E.T. for the Best Picture Oscar and earned Ben Kingsley an Academy Award for Best Actor. The movie was on the starchy side but at least its central character did things; Mandela endures his ordeal on a stately march to his own and his countrys liberation. In the early scenes of William Nicholsons screenplay Nelson gets to argue cases for black clients and wins because the whites bringing the charges are too insulted to be subject to a cross-examination from an inferior. But once in prison he must be the voice of moderation in effect negotiating between his more agitated colleagues and a stubborn government. Elba a one-man power storm as Stringer Bell in HBOs The Wire has also played gruff commanders -- bulls with balls -- in the sci-fi epics Prometheus and Pacific Rim. Here he must tamp down his energy to fit Mandelas slimmer quieter contours. That cedes center screen to Naomie Harris Winnie Mandela the dimpled firebrand who preaches revolt in the streets while Nelson counsels talking with the politicians. Elba may be at the heart of the movies narrative but Harris is its coursing bubbling blood.     We are told at the beginning of Mandela that white South Africans justified apartheid by believing (or pretending to) that science proved blacks were genetically inferior and that the Bible says they were put on earth to be subjugated. Those are also the claims of the plantation gentry that owned slaves forced them into exhausting unpaid labor and treated them like animals. ""A man does what he wants with his property"" says Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) the most vicious of the three overlords who own Solomon Northup. In Saratoga Springs N.Y. Solomon had earned a comfortable income as a fiddler and was treated as an easy equal by white friends and neighbors. Lured to Washington D.C. for what he thinks is a brief musical engagement he is filled with alcohol until he passes out and awakes in chains. Ignoring his pleas of full citizenship his captors beat him and send him south to servitude. If he wants to survive a fellow black advises him ""Tell no one who you are. Tell no one you can read and write."" And Northup insists ""I dont want to survive. I want to live."" Instead he keeps silent and endures the insult of a slave name Pratt Hamilton -- yes like Olivia de Havillands Melanie Hamilton from Gone With the Wind. These sprawling farms are no Tara -- they are gulags -- and 12 Years a Slave stands as a fierce refutation of the genial racial stereotypes on display in the Margaret Mitchell novel and David O. Selznicks movie version. Indeed McQueens film is closer in its storytelling particulars to such 1970s exploitation-exposes of slavery as Mandingo and Goodbye Uncle Tom. Except that McQueen is not a schlockmeister sensationalist but a remorseless artist. The scenes of black flesh peddled by venal salesmen do not excite; they repel. And repellent is the word for the slave trader Theophilus Freeman (Paul Giamatti) who encourages potential customers to prod the merchandise and check their teeth like horses. McQueens previous films addressed intense subject matter -- in Hunger Bobby Sands hunger strike against the British occupier in Northern Ireland and in Shame a man crippled by sex addiction both films starring Fassbender -- with an elegant visual austerity long takes that build suffocating tension and prod viewers to find meaning in the corners of the image. In the epic form of 12 Years a Slave his most approachable emotional film McQueen escalates the tension with two long scenes nearly 10 minutes of screen time. In the first Solomon is hanged but left with his toes barely touching the ground; there he dangles when losing his balance means death as the plantation owners wife strides by ignoring him as do the slaves who continue in their yard chores. In the second scene Epps grows enraged by his beloved slave mistress Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) who is also the most productive cotton picker on the farm and orders Solomon to whip her. The camera circles the two as lash follows lash to make the spectator share the suffering of Patsey and Solomon -- two victims of a sick master in a diseased social order. Though they considered their slaves less than human Southern whites of the plantation aristocracy were the true troglodytes inferior but in charge. McQueen shows that racism aside from its barbarous inhumanity is insanely inefficient. It can be argued that Nazi Germany lost the war both because it diverted so much manpower to the killing of Jews and because it did not exploit the brilliance of Jewish scientists in building smarter weapons. So the slave owners dilute the energy of their slaves by whipping them for sadistic sport and as Epps does waking them at night to dance for his wifes cruel pleasure. It is the rare white man who will speak racial equality to the plantation owners power; in 12 Years a Slave that voice is Brad Pitts. He tells Epps ""If you dont treat them as humans then you will have to answer for it."" Epps cant even understand the question. The movie enlists a small constellation of acclaimed actors including Benedict Cumberbatch as a slightly more genteel slaver and Alfre Woodard as a Southern woman who has achieved freedom of a sort by marrying a white. But Ejiofor has to be the focus. Like Elbas Mandela character Solomon is on the receiving end of abuse; his saving grace is the saintly dignity with which he endures and for posterity observes his own and a nations shame. The gentle center of a satanic land he provides the eyes and soul of 12 Years a Slave -- a document that is raw eloquent horrifying and essential.

Movies | Inside Movies Toronto 2013 12 Years a Slave is a landmark of cruelty and transcendence by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Jaap Buitendijk) 12 Years a Slave Posted September 7 2013 -- 1100 AM EDT Last year watching Quentin Tarantinos pop slave drama Django Unchained the cruelty on-screen could be hideous and shocking but one thing it never was at least to me was terrifying. Even when the white-on-black violence left you drop-jawed it was still part of a heightened Tarantino landscape of thrills and sick spectacle and kicky dark danger and revenge. But in Steve McQueens agonizingly magnificent 12 Years a Slave which premiered last night in Toronto a sense of terror is alive in almost every scene. To describe even one moment of this movie as a ""kick"" would be obscene. It evokes the lives of African-American slaves as the nightmare it was with violence spun into a daily fabric of brutality one thats neither heightened nor exaggerated just scarily real. Forget the earnest and epochal (but in hindsight not really raw enough) TV mini-series Roots forget the baroque exploitation of Mandingo and - despite the overstated accolades it received - forget Django. As a drama of the slave experience 12 Years a Slave renders them all irrelevant. It is a new movie landmark of cruelty and transcendence. The movie which is based upon a true story starts in 1841 and is about a free black man in Saratoga NY a musician named Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who walks around town in a natty gray suit and matching bowler hat secure in his talent and in the courtly modesty of his life as a husband and father. He has two children a boy and a girl and he loves them tenderly. He has everything that a man - not a 19th-century black man but any man - could want. But then when his family is out of town he takes up an offer to go on a trip to Washington D.C. with a couple of traveling entertainers. They say that theyll pay him generously and when the trip is winding down and theyre all having dinner at a ritzy restaurant drinking wine and the two men give him even more money than he was promised we get a queasy feeling that this is all too good to be true. And it is. Solomon isnt being hired for his talents. Hes being trafficked. A moment later he wakes up in a cold stark prison cell with a spider web of chains shackling his arms and legs. His wine was drugged he has been stripped of his identity and kidnapped and he is about to be placed on a riverboat and sent down to Louisiana where hell be sold into slavery. Gazing at his chains as if he were in a bad dream that he simply had to wake up from the great actor Chiwetel Ejiofor places us right inside his skin and all of a sudden were sharing the horror movie that Solomons life has become. Ejiofor has the noble sculpted features of an ancient Roman soldier and he may also have the most eloquent eyes of any actor working. Now twinkly now mournful they are oversize orbs of pure expression and in this movie they need to be because Solomon cant often speak what hes feeling. What we read in his intensely private thousand-yard stare is the agony of a man robbed of freedom but also the moment-to-moment recunciation of that despair. Whatever happens he will persevere. He will survive. He will know misery but he will not fall into the trap of madness. He will transcend. McQueen has made two previous features the sex-addict drama Shame (2011) which I found oddly and almost perilously unconvincing and his first film Hunger (2008) about the 1981 IRA prison hunger strike led by Bobby Sands - a movie that focused with purity and power on the agony of the body and how that carried the devotion of the soul. 12 Years a Slave reaches back to the McQueen of Hunger but its an even more lyrically wrenching and intense movie. Theres a scene early on in which Solomon gets sold by a grossly lighthearted slave trader (Paul Giamatti) and McQueen puts the spotlight not on Solomon but on the woman next to him who is being separated from her two children. Her plight echoes Solomons and it lends an underlying sadistic aura to every cruelty that follows. Whatever physical pain will be involved the agony is really spiritual parents cut off from their children each made dead to the other. Thats not just slavery thats soul murder. A free man kidnapped and placed into slavery may historically speaking be a relative anomaly (though it happened often enough). McQueens horrifying inspiration is to realize that Solomons plight can lead us into the experience of slavery far more than that of a born-and-bred slave. American slavery was among other things the worlds most egregious example of Stockholm Syndrome Those who lived their entire lives as slaves were coerced into a perverse identification with their ""masters."" But in giving us the story of a proud free man who becomes a slave and must therefore learn to answer insults with silence to bear whippings to pretend that hes an inarticulate toady who cant read or write McQueen makes us feel the extreme unnaturalness of slavery. For of course its not just Solomon who is really a ""free man."" So is every slave. 12 Years a Slave is based on a book published in 1853 that Solomon Northup wrote about his ordeal and McQueen working from a superb script by John Ridley has structured the movie as a diary-like series of anecdotes. There are characters we get to know like the two slave owners Solomon is sold to - the first (Benedict Cumberbatch) relatively benign the second (Michael Fassbender) a snarling lusty despotic son-of-a-bitch. There are motifs and developments scenes of hope and fear and intensity. Yet there is no trumped-up movie-ish drama no ""arcs"" no filler to pad out the experience were watching. The crushing reality of Solomons day-to-day existence is the drama; thats all the drama the movie needs. The organic artistry of McQueens approach hinges on what he does visually He stages scenes without a lot of cuts using his camera as a kind of peering gliding invisible witness. He captures not just the barbarity of slavery but the degraded nature of the relationships were seeing and he does it with a terrifying intimacy. Edwin Epps the Fassbender character is depicted as a mean and wily psychologist of racial obsession and when he discovers that Solomon has tried to get a white laborer to send a letter up north for him he takes the slave outside and holds his face close saying he knows whats up and Solomon defuses the situation with an ingeniously crafty lie that he must sustain for several minutes without a tremor while staring his overseer right in his taunting skeptical eye. This is gripping filmmaking with nothing allowed to get in the way of the super-close-up interaction on screen. Edwin develops an obsession with Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) the teenage slave girl he regularly rapes and their ""relationship"" becomes part of a debased triangle since Edwins wife (Sarah Paulson) is all too aware of his obsession. The way this plays out is that Patsey who picks more cotton each day than any of the other slaves (500 pounds of it) gets subjected to the torments of the damned and the performance of Lupita Nyongo is brilliant beyond words. Shes like Falconetti in Carl Dreyers The Passion of Joan of Arc going to a place of private craziness and communion beyond pain to the point that Patsey begs Solomon to take her down to the river and drown her. The most twisted moment in the movie comes when Solomon is forced to whip her himself and McQueen plays a startling cinematic trick He shows us the beating by focusing on the man holding the whip - a Hollywood cliche - and then just as weve been lulled into that old familiar its-only-a-movie mode the camera without a cut spins around to show us what the whipping is doing. The mortification of flesh hits us in our solar plexus. 12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes and at moments it is hard to watch yet its a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment you feel youre seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofors extraordinary performance that holds the movie together and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomons daily existence. The ultimate cruelty hes subjected to isnt the beatings or the humiliation. It is that he is ripped from his family blockaded away from all that he is. Yet such is the force of Ejiofors acting that he made me think of Nina Simones sublime rendition of ""Aint Got No/I Got Life"" the two songs from Hair that she transformed into an African-American gospel epiphany. Simone sang about how she too had known what it was to lose everything (""Aint got no clothes no country no friends no nothing aint got no God"") and because she had lost everything she had only one thing left She had life. 12 Years a Slave is a movie about a life that gets taken away and thats why it lets us touch what life is.

TWITTER Steve McQueens slave drama stars Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch. The recent popular revenge fantasy Django Unchained notwithstanding there have been so few good and strong films about slavery in America that for this reason alone 12 Years A Slave stands quite tall. With director Steve McQueen dedicating himself to detailing the ""peculiar institution"" with as many dreadful particulars as he can Chiwetel Ejiofor leads a fine cast with a superior performance as the real-life Solomon Northup a free black man from New York who was kidnapped in 1841 and sold into Southern slavery until being miraculously rescued. Perhaps the nature of the story is such that the film cant help but be obvious and quite melodramatic at times but it gets better as it goes along and builds to a moving finish. Despite the upsetting and vivid brutality Fox Searchlight has a winner here that will generate copious media coverage rivet the attention of the black public stir much talk in political and educational circles and appeal to film audiences who crave something serious and different. STORY 12 Years a Slave Met with Shock and Awe at World Premiere Northup published a memoir of his 12-year nightmare in 1853 the year after Uncle Toms Cabin came out and it was so successful that he went on to participate in two stage adaptations. The book dropped from sight in the 20th century but the movie tie-in will certainly reestablish its virtually unique status as a work by an educated free man who managed to return from slavery. British director McQueen whose striking first two features Hunger and Shame remained restricted to the art film world paints on a much bigger canvas and with a much broader brush here befitting a subject that defined the structure of American society before the Civil War. The nature of the outrage villainy and human suffering on display is entirely genuine if also familiar but it is never far removed from the direct experiences of Northup who near the beginning of his ordeal decides ""I dont want to survive I want to live."" For him this means getting back to Saratoga N.Y. where he has lived with his wife and children in well-to-do fashion until Northup who plays the violin is induced by two self-described entertainers to join them in Washington D.C. to makes some quick money. They get him drunk and he wakes up in chains and soon enough is on a boat to Louisiana where he is renamed Platt Hamilton by a slave trader (Paul Giamatti) and sold to plantation owner Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). PHOTOS Telluride Film Festival The Films That any of this could happen seems shocking of course but it was not uncommon in the years after the federal government banned the import of any further slaves. One of the most wrenching occurrences in any slave-era narrative is the forced separation of parents from children and this happens in Platts group to mother Eliza (Adepero Oduye) who almost never stops crying about it thereafter. A cultivated religious man Ford is impressed by Platts intelligence and fiddle playing which only arouses the ire of Platts immediate boss Tibeats (Paul Dano) who provokes Platt to the point that the black man savagely beats him. To save Platt from revenge Ford sells him to cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender the star of McQueens first two films) who like Uncle Toms Simon Legree likes to believe he can break slaves of any defiant or hopeful thoughts. Up to this point Northup/Platt is pretty strictly seen as a simmering victim while the whites with the exception of Ford are mercenary businessmen at best and outright villains at worst figures little different than the caricatures that have come down through the years in books and films. There are grace notes to be sure such as startling scene in which deep in the bayou a group of slaves encounter some Indians or when the relatively enlightened Ford reads from the Bible to family members and slaves together. But it is only at about the one-hour mark that matters deepen and therefore become more interesting. Fassbenders Epps (a real person who later in life read Northups book and declared that what he wrote was basically the truth) initially seems like the most evil creature in the South a drunk prone administering severe whippings and having his way sexually with slave women notably the slender Patsey (a very fine Lupita Nyongo) whom Platt also befriends. PHOTOS Telluride Highlights From the Festivals 40 Years However Fassbender reaches down to make him a more complex creation a sometimes shrewd observer of character in a tortured marriage with a wife (Sarah Paulson superb) who belittles him as a eunuch in front of the slaves and takes out her hatred on Patsey. The latter in turn begins to ask the impossible of Platt of whom Epps becomes suspicious of trying to send messages to the outside world which in fact he is. In the end its only the chance arrival of an itinerant Canadian carpenter Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt) who with Platt will put up a new building on Eppss plantation that provides the slave with the hope of an escape. An ardent abolitionist given to universal truths rather than local notions Bass is not afraid to argue with Epps or the rouse his ire by saying things like ""There is a fearful ill resting upon this nation."" Although hes been betrayed by many a white man before Platt takes a chance by entrusting his fate to this seemingly sincere fellow. Quite a few scenes of Platts near-lynching and some others actual hangings of terrific whippings and other punishments are pretty rough. The everyday drudgery and misery of plantation life and the arbitrariness with which slaves are moved around are readily apparent and the sentiments of the likes of Bass to the side there is not a whiff of any change to come apparent to anyone. This particular story may have after a fashion a happy and inspiring ending but very few other slave lives did. Ejiofor is terrific in a demanding character whos put through the wringer physically mentally and emotionally. One feels his determination to get back to his family virtually at all times even though he doesnt talk about it and toward the end there is an unusual extended close-up of him in which he looks out toward the unknown future as his eyes express a quicksilver array of emotions from wonder to fear to hope. Louisiana location work provides the perfect heated setting for a story expertly physicalized by production designer Adam Stockhausen costume designer Patricia Norris and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt. Hans Zimmers score combines with occasional religious music sung by the slaves to provide effective backgrounding but students of the composers work will quickly realize that the main chord progression here is almost precisely the same as the central one he used on what may be his greatest soundtrack that for Inception.

Had Steve McQueen not already christened his previous picture thus ""Shame"" would have been the perfect one-word title to capture the gut-wrenching impact of his third and most essential feature ""12 Years a Slave."" Based on the true story of free black American Solomon Northups kidnapping and imposed bondage from 1841 to 1853 this epic account of an unbreakable soul makes even Scarlett OHaras struggles seem petty by comparison. But will audiences have the stomach for a film that rubs their faces in injustice? As performed by Chiwetel Ejiofor Northups astounding story is too compelling not to connect with American audiences and important enough to do decent business abroad as well.This story first appeared in the September 10 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. The first thing fans of McQueens ""Hunger"" and ""Shame"" will notice here is the degree to which the helmers austere formal technique has evolved -- to the extent that one would almost swear hed snuck off and made three or four films in the interim. Composition sound design and story all cut together beautifully and yet theres no question that ""12 Years a Slave"" remains an art film especially as the provocative director forces audiences to confront concepts and scenes that could conceivably transform their worldview. If ""Django Unchained"" opened the door then ""12 Years a Slave"" goes barreling through it tackling its subject with utmost seriousness. The film opens in a world where slavery is a fact of life and Northup has no recourse to challenge his captivity. Duped and drugged on a bogus job interview he awakens in shackles and is beaten ferociously when he dares to assert his status as a free man. Some may wonder why he doesnt continue to protest forgetting that the word of a black man in pre-Civil War America had almost no legal currency especially if said individual was unable to produce his free papers. Assuming Northup wants to survive a fellow hostage advises he must do and say as little as possible in addition to hiding his ability to read and write. ""I dont want to survive"" Northup bellows. ""I want to live"" Separated from his wife and children he faces a situation where the entire society is stacked against him. While not every white person in the film is evil they willingly participate in a system that demeans their fellow man and the injustice is too great simply to forget and move on (as Hollywood and society would evidently prefer). Alarmingly the few films of the past century to engage directly with the institution of slavery have nearly all come from the exploitation sphere fetishizing aspects of violence and sexual abuse that McQueen endeavors to cast in a different light. An early scene in which slave trader Theophilus Freeman (Paul Giamatti) prods naked slaves for the benefit of prospective buyers offers an alarming yet in-no-way-arousing corrective to an equivalent sequence in the tasteless 1971 mock-doc ""Goodbye Uncle Tom"" which lingers on the nudity and degradation of such a market. Theres little ambiguity in these unflattering depictions though neither is there opportunity for audiences to misconstrue them as erotic. To simplify Northups memoir John Ridleys script lets the character -- stripped even of his identity as he is redubbed Platt Hamilton en route to market -- change hands just three times over the course of the film. Two of those owners played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Bryan Batt are as decent as the circumstances permit even going so far as to encourage the fiddle playing with which he previously earned his living in upstate New York. The third Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) becomes the bane of Northups existence -- a man who justifies his actions according to scripture and prides himself in ""breaking"" disobedient slaves. On Epps plantation ""Platt"" is expected to pick 200 pounds of cotton each day and is savagely beaten every time he falls short. For sheer productivity none of the slaves comes close to Patsey (Lupita Nyongo) a soft-spoken beauty of whom Epps is especially fond much to the consternation of his severe wife (Sarah Paulson). This jealous big-house matriarch is a familiar character among such exploitation movies as ""Mandingo"" constantly jealous that her husband prefers the favors of a slave and yet Paulson dodges the caricature even when throwing a heavy crystal decanter in Patseys face or urging her husband to beat the life out of her. Such cruelty is commonplace in the films first two hours and though audiences might not pick up on the technique McQueen applies the same unflinching approach to these moments that he used in ""Hunger"" and ""Shame"" long uninterrupted takes that force us to absorb the full impact of human mistreatment as when Northup survives a lynching attempt only to dangle from a noose for several minutes while his fellow slaves move about in the background too nervous to cut him down. This scene also perfectly illustrates McQueens knack for letting the characters behavior inform the sociology of the situation rather than explaining things overtly through dialogue. Though arguably too harsh for young eyes ""12 Years a Slave"" will serve as an important teaching tool giving audiences whove never witnessed the dynamics of slavery an impression of how the system worked. As in Northups near-hanging we see that even though slaves far outnumbered their white masters harsh discipline could serve to discourage organization by playing upon their survival instincts. Few scenes this year could be more depressing than Patsey begging Northup to end her suffering unless you count the one in which Epps forces him to beat her nearly to death -- an exchange heightened by the way McQueen constructs the sequence within a single 10-minute shot as the agitated camera circles her abuse. Actors like Nyongo dont come along often and shes a stunning discovery amidst an ensemble that carves out room for proven talents such as Paul Dano Alfre Woodard and Brad Pitt to shine. Though the film brims with memorable characters the show ultimately belongs to Ejiofor who upholds the characters dignity throughout. McQueen shrewdly limits everything audiences see and feel to the sphere of Northups direct experience drawing us into his head and keeping us there by including occasional shots in which this hyper-intelligent individual (in many ways the superior of his captors) struggles to make sense of his station. When it comes time to bestow awards voters tend to prefer characters who suffer to those who abuse and yet this actorly transformation may be Fassbenders most courageous yet tapping into a place of righteous superiority that reminds just how scary such racism can be. In many respects ""12 Years a Slave"" works like a horror movie beginning with a ""Saw""-style abduction and proceeding through subsequent circles of hell the tension amplified by a score that blends chain-gang clanging with those same foghorn blasts Hans Zimmer used in ""Inception."" As captured by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt however a rare beauty suffuses even the most infernal situations. This radiant aesthetic coupled with the rousing use of spiritual songs provide a beacon of optimism amidst so much hate once again proving cinemas place as the ultimate human-rights medium. Its a shame that such injustice was allowed to exist for so long -- 12 years for Northup and nearly 250 for those less fortunate -- and an even bigger disgrace that it takes a British director to stare the issue in its face.

Angela says September 13 2013 at 354 pm I cant believe you used a reference to an insipid fictional character in the dek of this review discussing a groundbreaking film about a real mans horrific kidnapping enslavement and torture. Do you have an editor? Reply naiki haikatsuto says September 11 2013 at 623 pm raruhuroren taoruhankachi naiki haikatsuto http//www.shoessroar.com/ Reply Katy says September 7 2013 at 543 pm Er latter not later. Rant over. Reply Katy says September 7 2013 at 539 pm It is outstandingly offensive to even thinking of comparing the trials Scarlett OHara endured to the true story of Solomon Northrup. The former was a fictional character who (to put it nicely) was a bratty white southerner who got her just desserts for her despicable behavior and upbringing. The later was a REAL PERSON who suffered due solely to the color of his skin. While your reference to Gone with the Wind is fleeting it is nonetheless disturbing. Reply Angela says September 13 2013 at 356 pm Agreed Katy I cant believe his editor (if he has one) didnt question the dek. Yet another example of the failing state of journalism. Reply Cathleen says September 6 2013 at 255 pm Great review. However what exactly do you mean by your last line ""...and an even bigger disgrace that it takes a British director to stare the issue in its face.""? I believe Steve McQueens family migrated to England from Grenada. Slavery was abolished in that country in 1834 so there is a good chance that his ancestors were enslaved there. This story is as much his to tell as it would be mine or my cousin in the Bahamas or my friends in Brazil. The African Diaspora stretches far and wide my friend due to the injustice of slavery. Reply J McKenna says September 3 2013 at 1001 am "" . . . and an even bigger disgrace that it takes a British director to stare the issue in its face."" Not surprising at all. The British were ahead of the United States in abolishing the slave trade (Slave Trade Act of 1807) first within Great Britain and then throughout its empire. The abolishment of slavery itself in most of the empire came with the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. I am sort of in disbelief that the true horrors of the slave trade and slavery itself seem to be some kind of revelation to some people. The reality has been a well known fact for generations. We also visited it decades ago with Roots - seen by everyone - and for Englands fight against the slave trade there is the more recent very excellent British film about William Wilberforce and William Pitt Amazing Grace. Very good review but I disagree about the film being too harsh for younger viewers. Not sure what ages the writer means. We seem all too willing to let our children watch vulgar trash disguised as comedy but it is suggested we shield them from the realities of inhumanity? No. THIS is what they need to see while their consciences are still being formed. I became engrossed in difficult topics such as the Holocaust and slavery at about the age of 10 and it helped to instill a quest for justice that I made my lifes work. This movie should be difficult for all ages to witness. But witnessing is what is needed. Reply Abby says September 3 2013 at 543 am Northup. There is no ""r"" in the second syllable. Reply The Kingslayer says September 2 2013 at 203 pm Chiwetel Ejiofor Idris Elba Tom Hanks and Mathew McConaughey are all going to battle it out for the Best Acting Oscar. Reply Adam Lipsius says September 2 2013 at 124 am This film captures the grotesqueness of slavery without any eroticizing or fetishization. The audience at Telluride with whom I watched 12 Years was speechless and outraged and compelled by this monumental movie -- without ever being turned on. After watching it the suggestion is ridiculous. Was Schindlers List holocaust-sploitation? 12 Years a Slave will make you think about justice and fairness and right in a whole new light. It is a remarkable accomplishment and a hell of a film. Reply Burt Gnash says September 1 2013 at 1229 pm I read something about this movie last year (http//movies-on-my-mind.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/slavesploitation-genre-that-shocked.html) in which 12 Years a Slave was labelled a slavesploitation picture. The article was very detailed in terms of the canon of slave exploitation movies and how American cinema always eroticises such an abhorrent element of our collective history. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says September 1 2013 at 441 am Whether you agree or disagree with the (excellent) review of this film there is one truism expressed here that everyone must agree upon. Quote ""Its a shame that such injustice was allowed to exist for so long -- 12 years for Northrup and nearly 250 for those less fortunate -- and an even bigger disgrace that it takes a British director to stare the issue in its face."" An existential prequel to THE HELP and THE BUTLER (and an apogee and apology for DJANGO UNCHAINED)...hopefully a movie that will put in its proper perspective the absolute horror of racism and domestic terrorism that persisted for centuries as America lauded itself as a ""democracy"" and all men created equal. Reply Carl Weathers says September 1 2013 at 1128 am ""hopefully a movie that will put in its proper perspective the absolute horror of racism and domestic terrorism that persisted for centuries as America lauded itself as a ""democracy"" and all men created equal."" Do you SERIOUSLY think that sentiment is lacking? From any academic institution to culture to of course Hollywood are we REALLY lacking discussions on racism and continuously focussing on the USs black eye(s)? Clearly you have no access to tv radio movies print or school. Reply Angel says August 31 2013 at 1128 pm Michael Fassbender is an astonishingly superb actor. Truly great talent. Brilliant. Reply Patrice says August 31 2013 at 220 pm FYI Peter there was an American who told this story already. Solomon Northups Odyssey ""Twelve Years a Slave"" (1984) Reply Patrice says August 31 2013 at 1217 pm Wow wow wow. The review has put me through the ringer. I can imagine what type of experience the film will be Reply Contessa46 says August 31 2013 at 649 am Not surprised that Brad Pitt is one of the producers of this film I saw the trailers to this at the theater and cant wait for its release. It seems to be a movie of substance and a true portrayal of the time. I minored in American history in college and have read extensively of the civil war. It looks as if from your review that it will be a most helpful teaching tool as there is nothing like a visual depiction to set everyone on their heels Its important for all to know what injustice the white men did to the black race it is our history. Reply Simone Cromer (FassFass) says August 31 2013 at 528 am Im going to see 12 Years a Slave at TIFF on Friday and Im equally excited and nervous to see this film. Being a fan of Steve McQueens work has prepared me for his unflinching truism in depicting the actualities of the topic he is filming. I fully expect to see a slave drama unlike anything that has ever been filmed before.

The very title of Steve McQueens ""12 Years a Slave"" provides that rare sliver of hope by establishing a rigid timeline within which the once-freed Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) would see release after being kidnapped and sold back into bondage in the mid-1800s. Northups story was a true terrible thing and by virtue of telling it the burdens of all American slaves are unflinchingly realized by Ejiofor and McQueen alike. Solomons journey from life as a respected Saratoga lawyer and family man to a fixture on several New Orleans plantations is conveyed with the same singular focus that defined McQueens earlier films ""Hunger"" and ""Shame."" Whereas the characters of those films (each played by Michael Fassbender) often inflicted pain upon themselves in pursuit of their passion and principles Solomon is punished by slave traders and owners epitomized by the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch Paul Giamatti Paul Dano and of course Michael Fassbender mostly vicious men who equate Solomons uncommon intelligence for common insolence. From our leads perspective the American South is a thicket of nightmarish scenarios wherein his rightful freedom is denied time and again. Acts of brutality visited upon Solomon are nearly as unsettling for their casual occurrence as they are for their physical violence and even rare gestures of mercy are tinged with reminders of this mans supposed inferiority. (The gift of a violin is accompanied by the reminder that it should bring both parties entertainment ""for a great many years to come."") ""Slave"" might be the most grimly accurate depiction of American slavery committed to film which in turn threatens to render monotonous countless inhumane offenses as the story stretches into its third hour. Its not that McQueen and writer John Ridley (working from Northups own memoir) could help it assuming they even wanted to. The subject matter doesnt exactly invite comic relief while cutting away to Solomons surely concerned family up north would have rung false and detracted from such an aptly oppressive experience. McQueen nonetheless manages to reinvigorate these cruelties on each occasion whether cutting between the sounds of music and the sights of agony during scenes of mandatory celebration or forced separation or subtly incorporating his trademark long take during an extended whipping scene as the potential for maximum emotional and physical anguish aligns with a harsh sense of inevitability. For the most part these high emotions are matched well by Hans Zimmers score although the odd flair of ""Inception""-like bombast deflates one particularly tense encounter early on. All of that impeccable composure and noble intent would be for naught were Ejiofor not the one grounding each indignity as Solomon. Its not that this ensemble is a feeble one -- Ive failed to yet mention Sarah Paulson Alfre Woodard Garret Dillahunt or astounding newcomer Lupita Nyongo -- but especially when compared to the showy ferocity offered up by Fassbender or bland sympathy provided by co-producer Brad Pitt as a Canadian abolitionist Ejiofors tightly clenched conviction perfectly embodies hope and righteousness against all odds. He gives the best performance of his career to date and whats more he gives ""Slave"" its bruised beating heart with every scene.

However Steve McQueens startlingly realized period drama justifies its introductory note with each ensuing scene recreating the experiences of a free black man kidnapped and sold into bondage at the tail-end of slavery in America so effectively that its almost not a movie in traditional terms; instead the plight of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) plays out like a poetic record of persecution. Initially a settled family man living in New York Northup eventually faces one bleak reality after another like an accidental war journalist dropped into the center of the trenches and were right there with him. Based on Northups 1853 bestseller ""12 Years a Slave"" owes much to Ejiofors knockout performance. But its a particularly noteworthy advancement in McQueens already impressive filmography as it funnels the cerebral formalism of his earlier features (the prison strike drama ""Hunger"" and the sex addict portrait ""Shame"") into a deeply involving survival narrative. As a result ""Slave"" injects its topic with remarkable immediacy. The spoilers right there in the title so McQueen wastes no time establishing Northups conundrum finding the solemn man living a hard life of labor picking cotton with his fellow slaves and vainly attempting to retain some modicum of hope. From there the movie flashes back to 1841 when Northup lives a happy life in Saratoga with his wife and two young children playing the violin at high society gatherings and seemingly removed from hardships down south. That changes quickly when a pair of men hire him to play a gig in Washington D.C. take him out for drinks ostensibly to celebrate and promptly drug him. Awaking in chains hes suddenly forced to adopt a new identity as ""Platt"" and told by the first of many cruel-eyed white men that hes an escaped Georgia runaway. Its here that ""Slave"" kicks into high gear using the full powers of film language to convey the despair that eventually consumes Northups surroundings. There are echoes of the paranoid urgency and claustrophobic McQueen memorably built around a single setting in ""Hunger"" but ""Slave"" carries them to a grander emotional scale. As Northup is thrust on to a boat with other frantic new captures Hans Zimmers pulsating score compliments an intense montage of whispered exchanges between Northup and the other prisoners. The strength of the images shot by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (""The Place Beyond the Pines"") first glimpsed in the prologue provide an intricate clash of colors -- from the sharp blues of the surrounding ocean to the murky shadows of the ships belly. The overload of sights and sounds efficiently sets up the stakes at hand with Northup struggling to adapt to a new set of rules More experienced slaves tell him to remain mum about his literacy keep his head down and follow each awful new order. But Northup a prideful man with education and culture to spare holds tight to a spirit of defiance. ""I dont want to survive"" he asserts. ""I want to live."" Thats just the prelude to a movie in which Northups valiant convictions get tested again and again. Though certainly heavy on plot John Ridleys screenplay gets swept up in Northups subjectivity so that rather than being led from one development to the next youre forced to process each revelation about his new environment along with him. It doesnt take long for Northup to see the extremes of his captivity At shore hes pushed into a slave auction by a ruthless merchant (Paul Giamatti in one of several bit parts that play less like stunt casting than a reflection of attentiveness to detail); upon arrival Northup is tasked with playing the violin to drown out the cries of a woman pulled apart from her children as theyre sold to a separate client. The challenges get worse from there While lucky enough to find some modicum of kindness in a levelheaded new owner (Benedict Cumberbatch) Northup runs into trouble from an envious white overseer (Paul Dano one-upping the unlikable qualities of his preacher in ""There Will Be Blood"" with a far slimier creation) who resents Northups measured intelligence. Their repeated showdowns provide the first test of Northups ability to withhold his anger toward the system and everybody responsible for putting him in it. Faced with the daunting task of imbuing a remote dilemma with realism Ejiofor matches McQueens filmmaking skill. The actors expression alone conveys a wholly unique set of emotions blending exasperation fear and rage that intensifies with each scene. McQueen gives his talent the same room to breathe that he does the story peppering the movie with patient long takes that often build into exceptional set pieces In one near death encounter Northup stands on his tip toes with a noose around his neck gazing and gasping at the surrounding plantation while the minutes crawl by. Later at a funeral for a fallen slave his fellowmen deliver a moving rendition of the cotton field staple ""Roll Jordan Roll"" and McQueens camera presses in on Ejiofors face as the man gradually joins in. The scene effectively completes Northups transformation into the role of victim that he initially resisted. With his slow-burn approach McQueen makes the air of defeat into an unnervingly visceral encounter. The technique serves to elaborate on the decade-plus period covered over the course of the movies 133 minutes. During that passage of time the mounting sense of dread never lets up. At the one-hour mark Northup finds himself on the plantation of depraved slave owner Edwin Epps (a convincingly monstrous Michael Fassbender) whose harsh antics provide the ultimate threat to Northups stamina. While there are hints of tension between Epps and a neighboring white man the script largely sweeps aside the specifics of the drama in favor of generalities that foreground the vividness of Northups emotional turmoil. On Epps planation the slave encounters a suicidal woman (newcomer Lupita Nyongo) subjected to virtually every form of abuse which places Northups desperation in the context of tragedies even deeper than his own. With the horrible finality of scenes where he witnesses other slaves meet worse fates -- whips and nooses figure prominently in the plot -- Northup takes on the role of spectator in a drama that predated his arrival. Its all so credibly enacted that once Brad Pitt (whose Plan B productions produced the film) arrives in a bit part as a kind-hearted Canadian who visits the plantation and speaks out against slavery the characters messianic qualities seem like a bit much. Yet by the time we get there its hard not to plead for an end to Northups battle. More than a powerful elegy ""12 Years a Slave"" is a mesmerizing triumph of art and polemics McQueen turns a topic rendered distant by history into an experience that short of living through the terrible era it depicts makes you feel as if youve been there. Criticwire grade A+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Well-received after its sneak peek at Telluride ""12 Years a Slave"" should continue receiving accolades as it next plays in Toronto and New York. Ejiofor is a lock for Best Performance in the Oscar race as is McQueen and his movie.

And Im getting tired of people acting as if ""12 YEARS A SLAVE"" was the first to really explore the horrors or impact of slavery. Its not the first. Its not even the second. The topic of slavery has been explored in numerous (if not enough) movie and television productions for nearly 40 years. And Im getting sick and tired of those acting as if ""12 YEARS A SLAVE"" is the sole accurate portrayal of slavery. Slavery had an impact upon many people and in different ways for centuries. There is no one clear portrayal of slavery here in the U.S. or anywhere else in the world. And although Michael Fassbender had some good moments I found his portrayal of Edwin Epps very over-the-top. I thought John Saxon did a better job in conveying both the brutality and the complexities of the character in Gordon Parks 1984 television movie. Reply anon May 12 2016 127 pm as the character was NOT born a slave and was well -to -do before his capture white people may like the film because strangly they may relate to it as they would think who would i cope being a slave? on the other hand some may be uncomfortable with it as to my knowledge there is no white saviour and the focus is on an articulate intelligent black man which is rarely ever depicted in hollywood. I for one cant wait to see it mqueen is a breath of fresh air and is one of the most orginal and interesting directors to come out in YEARS. Reply Larry Roberts May 12 2016 127 pm Was interested to find out that Gordon Parks had covered the same topic in the made-for-PBS Solomon Northups Odyssey aka Half Slave Half Free. Reply diana May 12 2016 127 pm this movie sounds like it will finally clear the mundane rhetoric of ""redemptive"" slave institution such as ""the Butler "" and ""Django""- and finally explore the transatlantic slave trade as the brutal genocide that it was. To me I see this work potentially matching the realities of the slave trade like the work of Gerima in his film Sankofa. Im excited. Reply Nashoba May 12 2016 127 pm As much as I ABHOR the entire genre as a fan of McQueens work I actually look forward to seeing this. With that said Im really REALLY hoping that this film is the very last of its kind. We spend entirely too much time bemoaning our past...while the future contentedly passes us by. In the last two years alone we have ""The Help"" ""Red Tails"" ""Django Unchained"" ""42"" ""The Butler"" and now this one. If alien visitors were to come down and review the last century of white people in American cinema theyd see impressive growth. If they did the same for black people...theyd think it was Groundhog Day. I didnt realize science fiction mystery and horror are like Kryptonite to black actors in lead roles as far as Hollywood is concerned. Laurence Fishburne was fantastic in ""Event Horizon"" and ""The Matrix""...but that was like 15 years ago-and we could certainly stand to see someone other than Will Smith holding down the sci-fi angle as his films are not the least bit challenging. My greatest fear is that we will see the end of automobiles as we know them replaced by flying vehicles and the like...and we will STILL be seeing new films about slavery and racism-probably produced and directed by black people. Reply Donella May 12 2016 127 pm ""While there are hints of tension between Epps and a neighboring white man the script largely sweeps aside the specifics of the drama in favor of generalities that foreground the vividness of Northups emotional turmoil."" Well the movie is 12 Years a Slave not 12 Years of Being the the Slaves Master. The clear protagonist driver of action and center of focus is and should be Northrup and the details of Northrups drama not Epps. Im so glad McQueen unlike past directors of antebellum movies finally placed the camera where it belonged. Reply Marbles May 12 2016 127 pm Fassbender needs to get the Oscar nomination he should have gotten for Shame-or Hunger or Prometheus for that matter. Reply caro May 12 2016 127 pm i hope theyre not a lock for Oscars like Fassbender was a lock for SHAME Reply Not another one May 12 2016 127 pm As an african american I am sick of the entire genre. How can politically correct HW and its critics dislike anything that makes the African American community a victim? I prefer The Butler as the character was never a victim.

I am looking forward to watching it Shame portrayed the life of a sex addict well and I hope 12 years can match it. Reply Mark May 12 2016 127 pm Im hoping that Ejiofor and McQueen are not only nominated but win. Im getting sick of seeing white savior characters lauded and the black characters ignored in films about slavery. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
