BY Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday March 28 2007 825 PM Written disappointingly by Wes Craven and his son Jonathan this limp sequel to last years remake of Wes 1977 original feels like the work of a guy whos spent a few too many days lost in the desert. The followup brings us back to dusty New Mexico where mutant hill dwellers have lived since the government conducted nuclear testing decades ago. They dont take well to outsiders so should you wander into their backyard you can plan on being killed raped or eaten. If youre dumb or unlucky enough you could hit the trifecta.Of course the National Guard trainees who arrive one sunny day have no idea of what awaits. So when they hear a fuzzy distress signal their sergeant (Flex Alexander) considers a search-and-rescue mission. Gung-ho soldier Crank (Jacob Vargas) grabs his rifle though peace-loving Napoli (standout Michael McMillian) who has clearly never seen a horror movie warns ""its not about making idiotic and possible fatal decisions."" Naturally hes outvoted and the troops not only climb up into the mountains but make the idiotic and probably fatal decision to enter the caves that dot the landscape. Played primarily by unknown actors each soldier gets exactly one defining trait and the Cravens didnt expend much energy coming up with them. Aside from the pacifist and a Rambo theres the fat one the brave one the pretty one and the one whos a devoted mother. The fact that her gleefully graphic and gratuitous rape is one of the few scenes staged with any effort should tell you most of what you need to know.On the whole this is an awfully long slog through very arid terrain in which generic soldiers track fight and try to escape from generic villains (youd be surprised at how uninteresting mutant flesh-eaters can be). I cant speak for the hills but I spent most of the movie just trying to keep my eyes open.elyzawaol.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Here an inexperienced National Guard Unit delivering supplies to the Section 16 military facility arrives to find the place deserted. Then its mirror signal manoeuvre as flashes from the hillside lure the part-time soldiers into traps set by mutant cannibal caveman Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) and his two bastard off-spring Chameleon and Hansel. Lacking the genre-steeped intelligence of Gregory Levasseurs screenplay for the Aja film the killing-by-numbers script from producer Wes Craven and his son Jonathan presents German director Martin Weisz with few opportunities for suspense or scares. Weisz prefers a single-minded pursuit of ugly set-pieces and repellent sexual violence. Weisz first feature was Butterfly A Grimm Love Story a banal study of a real-life cannibal killer. Like this sorry sequel it amounted to far less than the sum of its body parts.

The Hills Have Eyes 2 is a different beast a retro horror-comedy featuring quick deaths and cheapo-looking gore with a few dorky laughs and gross-outs but not so many scares.

"Who should live and who should die in The Hills - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Who should live and who should die in The Hills By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 24 2007 Given the way popular culture is becoming fully on-demand some day the movies might have to adopt the ""American Idol"" model and let the viewer decide.At the megaplex the most natural beneficiary of such an entertainment upgrade (if customizing your movies is something you prefer) would be horror fans. For years theyve had to sit through hours of gems and dreck watching macho men get an ax to the chest and wily lusty young women become Final Girls (the last women standing). This possible future would allow kids to vote for victims decide survivors and ultimately crown their own Final Girl.Written by Wes Craven and his son Jonathan  ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" is tailor-made for such a contest. Nine men and women of different races and varying degrees of intelligence from all over the country descend on an abandoned military outpost in the New Mexico desert. Theyre National Guard troops on a training assignment (destination Kandahar ) that suddenly becomes a search-and-rescue mission after desperate voices are heard over the airwaves. Some of these guardspeople are more likable than others and right away we pick up on who the family of lurking post-atomic cavemen should pick off first.I for starters would have kept calling in to expunge Sergeant Millstone (Flex Alexander  the comedian) from this movie. Hes the commanding officer but his stiff orders didnt convince me he should have been in charge. He doesnt listen to anyones advice but he does keep reminding us that this isnt spring break. (All the skull and crotch bashing might leave you eager to see a bikini or some board shorts though.) Lacking a beach were left to wonder if the anonymous rocky desert is meant to make us think were already in Kandahar. The new movie is a pre-combat nightmare whereas the first -- Alexandre Ajas effective 2006 remake of Cravens low-rent 1977 original -- was pure post-nuclear paranoia.Obviously the sequel is predicated on wavering common sense most of which belongs to the most wholesome-looking pair of the bunch -- Napoleon (Michael McMillian ) and Amber (Jessica Stroup ) two privates. I would have kept them around for their brains. Private Crank (Jacob Vargas ) is the hothead who gives everybody a hard time just because he can. His volatility makes him enjoyably unpredictable When will he do something dumb enough to get himself or someone else killed?Things go gory fast. The cutest guy is yanked left leg first through a hole barely big enough for a thigh. Other people are left to splatter on the rocks. The cavemen are horny and need the two women in the crew alive and Private Martinez (Daniella Alonso ) is bold (and foolhardy) enough to relieve herself alone among the crags. Her capture inspires a rescue mission within the rescue mission thats surprisingly suspenseful.The director Martin Weisz  doesnt lean on a lot of noise and editing tricks. He can relax since all the scares are built into the Cravens script which invokes both ""Goonies"" and last years instant-classic chicks-versus-cave-dwelling-vampires flick ""The Descent."" ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" isnt as entertainingly witty as either of those movies but an assault and a near-assault actually almost make characters of the two women.Any audience with good judgment and the right to vote would keep them around until the finals. We all know their revenge against the mutant hillbillies will be the most satisfying.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movie go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Starring Michael McMillian Jessica Stroup and Daniella Alonso. Directed by Martin Weisz. (R. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at SFGate.com/movies.) As unnecessary horror remakes go last years ""The Hills Have Eyes"" did just about everything right. Sure the movie had nothing to say that wasnt covered in Wes Cravens 1977 original but it still came through with stylishly gruesome directing quality actors who could sell the dark humor and buckets and buckets of gore. All thats left in ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" is the bloody carnage and much of that is filmed in caverns so dark that you cant tell a severed foot from a decapitated head. The good guys are incredibly dumb thus theyre almost impossible to root for. And the bad guys in this movie all look exactly the same -- like a cross between a pineapple Jay Leno and Eric Stoltz in ""Mask."" While its not that unusual for a quality movie to be followed by a terrible sequel this is a prime opportunity to examine what makes a good splatter film. The ""Hills"" remake was a harrowing journey focusing on a family whose RV stalled in the middle of the desert -- where a gang of deformed homicidal maniacs picked them off one by one. The wayward travelers mostly seemed like helpless underdogs until the wimpy-looking son-in-law rose to the challenge and turned the tables on his tormenters. The good guys in ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" are a troop of well-armed soldiers who at first look would seem to have every advantage over the cleaver-wielding trolls living in the mountain. Its only through their consistent bad decision-making that the bad guys continue to gain the upper hand. Our heroes are quite literally too stupid to live and its not fun to watch. Craven and his son Jonathan wrote the screenplay for ""Hills II"" but theres almost nothing original or surprising in the dialogue or action. This is exactly the kind of predictable horror detritus that Craven made fun of more than a decade ago when he directed ""Scream."" The good guys die predictably in reverse order of how hot they are. (The movie poster tagline should read ""The Cute Ones Die Last."") Some of the plot points are repetitive from the original such as a sympathetic mutant who helps the good guys. And while the production design in the remake was creepy-cool the cliffs and underground tunnels where 95 percent of ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" takes place are indistinguishable from shot to shot. Worse yet theyre always leaving a gun behind walking off to take a pee by themselves or going back for a doomed friend -- even long after the threat has been established. Most horror films require a couple of stupid decisions just to keep the action moving. In ""Hills II"" the entire plot is built on the poor survival skills of its protagonists. There are one or two flairs of coolness such as the bad guy who slices a soldiers arm off -- and then uses the severed limb to wave goodbye as he pushes the good guy down a cliff. But theres nothing in ""Hills II"" that approaches the best work of Craven who showed in the underrated 2005 thriller ""Red Eye"" that hes capable of much better. Its also worth noting that someone involved in this movie has a strange fetish for people getting attacked while they go to the bathroom. The film may not be as scary as its predecessor but it will make you think twice before you use a Porta Potti again. -- Advisory This film contains adult language heavy amounts of violence and gore and a rape. Theres also a scene where a guy crawls up through the bowels of a toilet which you should already be emotionally prepared for if youve watched the last 20 minutes of ""The Shawshank Redemption."" (Or any episode of ""Jackass."")

Horror sequels and remakes? What they usually signify is one more trip to the well with a bucket of blood. But while ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" -- a sequel to a remake -- may inhabit familiar geography screenwriters Wes Craven and son Jonathan have shifted the dramatic landscape The scene is still the A-bomb test site of Wes Cravens 1977 original and it includes the mutant cannibals of Alexandre Ajas 2006 remake. This time though the victims are National Guardsmen the issues include training and equipment and the entire scenario adds up to an unmistakable critique of the war in Iraq. The politics of ""Hills 2"" wont enlist any new converts to the horror ranks but existing fans will be drawn to the combination of visceral tension violent payoff and the patented Craven gift for innovative gore. Pic bowed to 10 million in North America and landed in seventh place over the weekend. The scene is a 1300-square-mile patch of New Mexico where the Carter family of the previous ""Hills"" pics met their fate at the hands of mutant psycho Quasimodo look-alikes bio-victims of government nuclear tests. Immediately upon arriving the ""Hills 2s "" National Guard patrol is set upon by the grotesque cave-dwellers who hit and run with such eerie speed that the Guardsmen -- all young and untrained -- are immediately unnerved. It doesnt do much for their confidence that the team of scientists and military they were supposed to meet have all vanished. While nothing is as broadly political as the impalement -- by an American flag -- perpetrated in the 2006 ""Hills Have Eyes"" the sentiments are obvious enough. Napoleon (Michael McMillian) the smartest member of the co-ed Guard group that finds itself in a hostile desert is challenged about his lack of enthusiasm for the war. ""Presidents lie too much"" he says. Hes given little slack ""The last president who told the truth was Truman"" barks his commanding officer Sarge (Flex Alexander) ""and you know what he said? The buck stops here "" Sarge and Napoleon are never going to get along but the way things are working out with the natives it really wont matter. In their first outing as a screenwriting team the Cravens dont offer a lot in terms of plot -- mostly the imperiled attempt to become unimperiled. But with the exception of a ridiculous ""Are you OK?"" when the person has been abducted beaten and raped (and which may have been intended as a ""Scream""-style joke line) the dialogue sparks and the humor relieves without intruding on the mood of terror. A scientist offering a cheery ""Hi"" to a ghoul lunching on intestines? How can you not laugh? Helmer Martin Weisz whose background is largely in musicvideos meets the challenge of creating dread in broad daylight before the entire cast of soldiers and carnivores heads underground into the warren of mines and tunnels where the mutants dwell. Cinematographer Sam McCurdys work is really fine -- the outside world is crisp creepy and khaki-colored while his subterranean shooting is in surroundings so deprived of light youre surprised you can make out whats down there. But oh yes you can. And you probably wont like what you see.

"Hills Have Eyes II The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hills-have-eyes-ii-the ) Hills Have Eyes II The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Hills Have Eyes II is a sequel to a remake but not a remake of a sequel. Curiously Horrormeister Wes Craven has been involved in all four movies featuring the words ""hills"" and ""eyes"" in the title. He wrote and directed the 1977 original and its 1985 sequel. He produced the 2006 remake and now he has added writer/producer credits for this movie to his resume. However whatever optimism I may have had for the movie considering Cravens involvement evaporated quickly once in the theater. Whatever contribution Craven made to the screenplay must have occurred in the middle of the night while he was blindfolded. The hills might have eyes but this is one of those times I wish I didnt; then I could have been spared the headache and boredom inducing experience of sitting through this. If the purpose of a horror film is to deliver violence and gore The Hills Have Eyes II provides those elements aplenty. There is carnage and viscera to go along with a particularly disturbing (and graphic) birth scene and an equally shocking (and unnecessary) rape. However if the purpose of a horror film is to frighten and unsettle The Hills Have Eyes II fails. The movie has no atmosphere to speak of and it is abominably ineffective when it comes to generating tension or suspense. This is yet another movie where audience members can play the ""fun"" game of figuring out in what order the cardboard characters will get picked off and how many of them will survive to see the end credits. The Hills Have Eyes II sends a National Guard unit on a training mission into ""Area 16"" in the New Mexico desert. (They would have been in better shape had they been deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan.) The characters all have names but since theyre mostly played by unknowns its probably most instructive to refer to them by their defining characteristics the tough black sergeant (Flex Alexander) the peacenick (Michael McMillan) the gung-ho lothario (Reshad Strick) the inept big guy (Eric Edelstein) the two women (Jessica Stroup Daniella Alonso) the perfect soldier (Lee Thompson Young) the coward (Ben Crowley) and the shoot-before-thinking hothead (Jacob Vargas a hey Ive heard of him). These guys climb a mountain lose a few of their members to the mutants who live in the area get stuck up there when their ropes are stolen then spend the rest of the movie wandering around in disused mines. The Descent proved that its possible to create a taught horror movie in underground passageways. All it requires is a little ingenuity and a strong sense of atmosphere. The Hills Have Eyes II illustrates that its possible to utilize a similar premise to dismal effect. Once the characters get underground the movie turns into a bore. Theres no gnawing sense of claustrophobia. Theres no growing feeling of menace. Theres just resignation that were going to have to spend an hour with these uninteresting characters as they stumble around looking for daylight. Sure there are occasional appearances by adult mutant ninja cannibals but these guys arent much fun. Then there are the necessary contrivances demanded to even the odds as the soldiers all run out of ammo at the same time. Fix bayonets The creature work in The Hills Have Eyes II is bad enough to be called amateurish. It looks like the makeup department took some big actors and stuck colored marshmallows all over their bodies. Rather than appearing frightening they look silly. They would probably be more effective if their exposure to the camera was limited but unlike the rubber shark in Jaws theyre shown too often in good light. The only horrific sight is that of the pregnant woman during the opening sequence but the overall effect is more repellant than frightening. The Hills Have Eyes II is made for the undiscriminating horror ""fan"" - someone whos looking for a fix of blood and gore without much caring what goes along with it. Sadly this has become the state of the genre in the 90s and its an indication of how bad things have gotten when respected icons like Wes Craven have fallen prey to the pitfalls of fast money and shoddy production values. After this disgrace its time to shut the hills eyes for good.
