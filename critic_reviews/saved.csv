Starring Julia Stiles Sean Patrick Thomas Fredro Starr. Directed by Thomas Carter. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In her new movie reluctant teen queen Julia Stiles ""gets her black on"" as the kids at her new Chicago public school would tell her. Stiles (""Down to You"") learns to say stuff like ""slammin "" and ""bust a cap"" while trying to shed the trauma of her mothers death in order to get psyched to dance her way into Juilliard. But ""Save the Last Dance"" is not really about the urbanization of Julia. When she moves from rural America to the Windy City to live with her estranged dad shes so casually unimpressed with her ghetto digs that she might as well have taken the El there. The movie is smitten with Stiles urban crossover appeal. And were happy to report that contrary to the movies wishes her whiteness emerges enlightened but intact. The equally unflappable Sean Patrick Thomas plays her classmate Derrick. He gives Stiles Sara lessons in how to be hip-hop -- slouching grunting using dance moves that illustrate what would happen if Judith Jamison got her hands on N Sync. Eventually they fall in love. He gives her his culture. She gives him her heart. It hardly seems fair. But the movie never condescends to play cultural- exchange games. Its simply a bid to win Stiles the black vote. Its pseudo- progressive stance on interracial dating is betrayed by its glaring uncoolness and formal stupidity both of which equate to a sort of backhanded racism. Why do the photography and editing act a fool whenever the needle drops on some hip-hop Ramp;B record? (And why is the hottest club for the fake-ID crowd spinning jams that were hot three years ago?) The movie means well -- or does it? Were told the bare essentials about Derricks family life (you know Mommas a crackhead etc). But how the outspoken ill-named Chenille (Kerry Washington) could be his sister is a case for the gene police. Bound for Georgetown Derrick is meant to be a testament to a young brother shedding his hoodlum past. Its hard to embrace that though when his thug life embodied by hip-hop bully Fredro Starr is sitting right across from him in the school caf. Produced by MTVs film division the movie combines the worst of urbansploitation with the worst of teensploitation and outfits them both in makings of the ultimate racial-crossover melodrama -- teen motherhood deadbeat teen dads drive-bys a dangerous ex-girlfriend speeches straight from the pages of Terry McMillan. The result is more like an epic ""After School Special"" -- preachy runny and oddly warm. This movie would sooner see Derrick help Sara fulfill her Juilliard destiny than acknowledge how hard he worked to get into G-Town. Its profoundly square screen writing. . This film contains violence and raw language.

(Paramount) In ""Save the Last Dance"" a hip-hop-flavored ""Dirty Dancing"" of sorts two people of different hues and views come together through dance Sara (Julia Stiles) a white middle-class small-town girl who dreams of a ballet career and Derek (Sean Partick Thomas) an African American from inner-city Chicago with all the dance-floor moves whos waiting for that acceptance letter from Georgetown University. If ""Last Dance"" follows the dance-romance rules too obviously it also puts a new twist on the old routine. Director Thomas Carter really delves into African American youth culture. This is a spirited dirty dance between the polished inauthenticity of Hollywood romance-musicals and hip-hops central tenet keeping it real. Its an intriguing combination if nothing else. When her mother dies in a car accident Sara is forced to leave the suburbs to live with her estranged father Roy (Terry Kinney) downtown. Hes real downtown real Southside this cat of a dad. Plays trumpet late into the night for a jazz combo never washes his hair has no idea how to deal with his prodigal daughter. Sara who cant bear the thought of continuing ballet -- since Mom was on her way to Saras big audition when she died -- is very much on her own. Saras new school is predominantly black and students are searched for weapons upon entering the front door. But she soon gets chummy with Chenille (Kerry Washington) who introduces Sara to her social circle teaches her how to look ""slammin "" in clothes and gets her a fake ID for Stepps a dance club where the only no-no is dancing white. It turns out Chenille is the sister of Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) the opinionated student Sara locked horns with during English class. Oops. At Stepps Derek a beatific self-assured prince of a fellow challenges Sara to show her stuff on the dance floor. Of course Sara whose ballet training is useless here makes a fool of herself amid the flailing arms and heaving torsos and a Southside Story is born. Between the cliches -- and there are so many it would take several extremely dull film-school papers to list them all -- the movie does have a spark. Director Carter seems to be trying to make this movie bust loose and the cast seems to be in on the game. Its as though everyone is well aware of the cheese factor -- this movies about as credible as a Benetton commercial -- but wants to give it everything theyve got regardless. Stiles whose dancing is obviously intercut with a superior stunt performer is an appealing presence. She has to gamely look stupid for a long time (in dress dance and slanguage) before she becomes more assertive. As Chenille an extremely savvy student who steers a proud course between single motherhood and having a good life Washington is a thoroughly appealing performer. And rap artist Fredro Starr puts a few grace notes into Malakai Dereks somewhat cliched friend whos doomed to a life of street crime. But Thomas is the movies best element. He puts so much authority in his performance he makes this controversial romance seem like the best thing that could happen to anyone. Thats no easy task.SAVE THE LAST DANCE (PG-13 113 minutes) -- Contains gun violence sexual situations and obscenity.

(Paramount) ""Save the Last Dance"" takes its cues from the musical dramas of the 70s but this otherwise engaging young-adult romance never quite catches Saturday night fever. Then again its far from tepid teen fare thanks largely to the sweet chemistry between up-and-comer Sean Patrick Thomas and leading lady Julia Stiles. Stiles (""10 Things I Hate About You"") plays Sara a small-town ballerina who discovers her inner booty when she transfers to an urban high school after her mothers death in a car crash. Her mom had been on the way to watch her daughter dance and the grieving guilt-stricken teen hangs up her toe shoes and abandons her dream of attending Juilliard. After the funeral she is obliged to move in with her estranged father (Terry Kinney) a struggling musician with a seedy flat on Chicagos South Side. Sara one of a handful of white students at the school is befriended by Chenille (Kerry Washington) and her brother Derek (Thomas) the John Travolta of the local hip-hop scene. Chenille and Derek soon have the middle-class Sara doing her thang in fashionably baggy floor-dragging jeans. Along the way Derek and Sara fall in love. A clash of cultures ensues. Thomas (CBSs ""The District"") with his gleaming smile warm manner and dashing good looks is definitely on the Denzel track. Hes also careful to avoid the streetwise behavior so often inherent in roles created for young black men. He and the far-from-lithe Stiles clearly arent professional dancers and the choreography doesnt disguise their shortcomings. But they remain a convincing appealing twosome. Three-time Emmy winner Thomas Carter (""Swing Kids"") directs from a rambling script by Cheryl Edwards and Marylander Duane Adler. The latters screenplay originally dealt with the experiences of the only white player on a high school basketball squad. You can be sure Adler knows from development hell and we feel his pain.Save the Last Dance (113 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some violence dirty dancing and swear words.

"Save the Last Dance | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; save-the-last-dance ) Save the Last Dance (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Save the Last Dance a movie about finding salvation on the dance stage takes a little Pygmalion a little Romeo and Juliet and a lot of formula wraps them up with a neat bow and delivers a passably entertaining package. The film stumbles not so much in its strict adherence to the expected but in its sometimes facile and unconvincing resolution of complex issues (interracial relationships grief and its associated guilt escaping the snare of gang wars and urban violence). Also the use of dance as a channel to redemption is not as fresh as it would have seemed a year ago. In the interim Center Stage and Billy Elliot have offered some of the same ideas. However balancing out Save the Last Dances weaknesses are energetic choreography and strong acting and these two factors go a long way towards mitigating the problems associated with the films less effective elements. While Billy Elliot and Center Stage are appropriate touchstones for Save the Last Dance because all three films deal with ballet in one form or another the circumstances of the lead character in this movie are actually closer to those of the protagonist in Karen Kusamas Girlfight. Although numerous issues are being employed as grist for director Thomas Carters mill in Save the Last Dance the films core is centered upon a young womans struggle to find the inner strength to move forward while living in a harsh unforgiving urban environment. However when it comes to the quality of the writing Save the Last Dance falls considerably short of the mark set by Girlfight. The characters are not as deeply realized the dialogue is not as crisp and the plotting has a distinctly scripted feel to it. Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles) has spent her entire life training for a career in dance but when her mother dies in a traffic accident on the day of her unsuccessful audition for Julliard she gives it all up. Forced to live with her estranged bohemian father (Terry Kinney) in a Chicago ghetto she finds herself as one of the few white girls in a predominantly black high school. There she meets and befriends Chenille (Kerry Washington) a fun-loving teenage mother. Nikkis brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) has one of the most promising futures of any student at school - he has already been accepted at Georgetown and has aspirations of becoming a pediatrician. His initial relationship with Sara is contentious but as the two get to know each other the attraction grows - especially once Derek becomes her mentor in hip-hop and rekindles her interest in ballet. But Dereks bright future is not secure because the violent tendencies of his best friend Malakai (Fredro Starr) threaten to involve him in a street war. It doesnt take much in the way of prognostication skills to determine that the climax of Save the Last Dance will have Sara giving some sort of performance nor is it difficult to guess many of the plot points that the movie will hit along the way. The most frustrating aspect of the production is that the occasionally trite screenplay fails to attain the level necessary to match the talent of the lead performers. The movie addresses social issues such as the resentment that can fester as a result of an interracial coupling but soft-pedals some of the real difficulties by employing a ""love conquers all"" resolution. Its as if the film is uncomfortable about frightening away its core teenage audience by being too gritty or venturing too far from the anticipated formula. Save the Last Dance may be sincere in its intentions and theres no evidence of a lack of ambition (it skims over enough issues for three or four more tightly focused movies) but an unwillingness to genuinely shock or challenge viewers represents its most pervasive flaw. The work of Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas elevates Save the Last Dance to a level where it is not only watchable but moderately entertaining. In addition to exhibiting real chemistry these two have the ability to make the tired dialogue sound less stale and the clichA(c)-riddled plot feel less half-baked. In a relatively short time Stiles has built an impressive resume with appearances in two movies based on Shakespeare plays (10 Things I Hate About You Hamlet) and a key supporting role in a David Mamet movie (State and Main). She has a natural ability and an unforced charm (not to mention the requisite athleticism) that make it easy to accept Sara as much more than a writers construct. Similar comments can be made about Thomas. His list of credits may not be as impressive as Stiles (his most recent outing was as one of the goons-turned-vampires in Dracula 2000) but his performance is. Save the Last Dance was probably given the kiss-of-death opening date in January not because its a bad movie (which most early year releases are) but because Paramount couldnt figure out how to market the film. Even the best ""issues"" movies often have difficulty finding an audience and this one is far from the cream of the crop. Save the Last Dance is worth seeing to appreciate what Stiles and Thomas can do with the material but Im not sure its worth spending the kind of money that movie theaters are charging for tickets.

One less benign sign of these retro times This wan formulaic teen movie from ""Metro"" director Thomas Carter is afraid to pump up the volume on its own interracial hip hop Romeo and Juliet story lest it challenge even one sedated viewer or disturb the peace. Juliet in this case is Sara (Julia Stiles) a student ballerina who puts away her dream of attending Juilliard when her mother dies. Taken in by her estranged father (Terry Kinney) a jazz musician living on Chicagos South Side a gloomy Sara enters a high school where her flaxen waxen ways set her apart from her predominantly black classmates. Nevertheless its not long before shes rocking out at a hot club with her cool new best school friend Chenille (Kerry Washington) - an unwed mother with a flair for fashion - and developing a romantic relationship with Chenilles smart handsome athletic gifted sensitive poster boy brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) who teaches the white chick some funky floor moves. (At least he teaches someones feet some steps The phlegmatic Stiles above the waist stolidity seems to bear no relationship to the anonymous guest legs working hard down below.) ""Save the Last Dance"" teaches that you should never give up on your dreams and that love is all you need two falsehoods driven home by a thumpy soundtrack. Serious issues facing a black man involved with a white woman are discussed and apparently solved in record time while any serious acknowledgment that Stiles/ Sara really doesnt have the talent for Juilliard is ignored by the stuntwoman in toe shoes.

Neither especially inspired nor unpalatably saccharine this tale of a white girl trying to fit into black life on Chicagos South Side while recovering her passion for ballet is grounded in bedrock formula and earnestness. Beneath its hip-hop gear ""Save the Last Dance"" is as basic as a teen drama can be. Neither especially inspired nor unpalatably saccharine this tale of a white girl trying to fit into black life on Chicagos South Side while recovering her passion for ballet is grounded in bedrock formula and earnestness. With its themes of racial harmony and good high school kids realizing their dreams pic avoids easy exploitation. This unexpectedly serious early-January entry from Paramount and MTV Films will appeal to the best qualities in the young date crowd who will hold hands and listen in modest but not chart-busting numbers. Instead of the teen movies usual sarcastic or happy-face opening notes intro of terpsichorean heroine Sara (Julia Stiles) is unusually melancholy We see her taking a train to Chicago and recalling the car crash that killed her mother who was racing to catch Saras tryout for the Juilliard Schools ballet program. The melodramatic backstory over opening credits is compact but too sketchy in its attempt to present Sara as both a young person whos given up her ballet dreams and an innocent white girl from outside the city. Taken in by her estranged dad Roy (Terry Kinney) who lives in a rotting South Side flat and works by night as a jazz trumpeter Sara must adjust not only to her new home life but to Wheatley High School where shes just about the only Anglo on campus. Director Thomas Carter (""Swing Kids"" ""Metro"") tries not to portray the inner-city school as a Hollywood nightmare of black ghetto life but in doing so he tends to smooth the rough edges and the tough every-day realities of contempo public schools. Sara tries to keep her innocent shock at the unfamiliar scene hidden but Stiles innate coolness tends to make her remote. Smart-as-a-whip Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) has a way of provoking Sara though and soon shes learning to trash-talk back to him amusing Dereks sister Chenille (Kerry Washington). Friction being attraction Derek cant resist asking Sara out on the dance floor at the hot local club Stepps but its quickly clear that Sara doesnt know her hip from her hop. Its just as clear that the script by Duane Adler (from his story) and Cheryl Edwards will serve up characters who are here simply as blunt obstacles for Derek and Sara to overcome For him its his best friend gangsta-in-training Malakai (Fredro Starr) Mercutio to Dereks Romeo; for her its obnoxious Nikki (Bianca Lawson) who recently dumped Derek and considers Sara a one-woman threat to black women everywhere. The dramas gears dont always mesh and pics midsection meanders in various undeveloped directions. While Stiles and Thomas work up a cuddly chemistry as their romance takes flight -- Thomas is especially warm and inviting -- his character is sometimes reduced to a mere instrument allowing Sara to get in touch with her soulful side delivering pep talks when she decides to reapply to Juilliard. Disparate bits such as Chenilles life with hopeless b.f. Kenny (Garland Whitt) who cant be a dad to her baby are glimpsed rather than explored. And the idea that Derek whos ready to attend Georgetown U. and study to be a pediatrician would even entertain the idea of going on a drive-by with Malakai -- despite their past history of mutual loyalty -- is preposterous. Fortunately ""Save the Last Dance"" backs away from what could have been a half-baked ""Romeo and Juliet""-like tragedy and ends on an appropriate note of optimism. Stiles takes a while to get inside this girls conflicts but her performance and her dancing blossom in a pleasant spirited way. Despite his impossibly good character (a close cousin to black literary wunderkind Jamal in ""Finding Forrester"") Thomas projects a potently attractive self-confidence that would win over a gal like Sara. Washingtons perf ensures that moody Chenille is more than mere support. Kinneys role feels trimmed preventing us from seeing his jazz world which surely would be a revelation to Sara. Filmmakers ensured pics PG-13 rating by keeping the sexual element well out of sight. Except for a romantic interlude with the young lovers watching the Joffrey Ballet at the Chicago Theater location work emphasizes the rough parts of mostly chilly Chitown -- without getting too rough. Mark Ishams uncharacteristically drippy score devoid of the slightest tincture of hip-hop belongs in another movie.
