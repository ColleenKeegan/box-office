Comments Son of the Mask Whatever possessed director Lawrence Guterman and writer Lance Khazei to transform the sequel to 1994s libidinous hit comedy into pabulum? Too low-key and amiable to match the lubriciousness Jim Carrey brought to the original Jamie Kennedy is miscast as a harried dad the new owner of the mask lost by Loki the Norse god of mayhem. But then Kennedy doesnt spend much screen time under its spell; mostly he reacts to antics performed by warring animated versions of his shape-shifting baby and dog. Even Alan Cumming--so deliciously reptilian in previous roles--is defanged by the insipid script; all his spike-haired Loki really wants is the love of papa Odin (Bob Hoskins). PG 86 min.

"Mask All Tricks No Treat washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Museums and Galleries >> Follow Style On Mask All Tricks No Treat Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 18 2005 Jamie Kennedy is by many accounts a funny guy. You wouldnt know it though from ""Son of the Mask"" the anemic sequel to the 1994 Jim Carrey vehicle ""The Mask"" in which Kennedy is forced to play second fiddle to a computer-animated dog and a baby who urinates like Old Faithful. Following the premise established in the first film Kennedys aspiring cartoonist Tim Avery stumbles upon a magical mask belonging to the Norse god Loki (Alan Cumming) which transforms the wearer into a wisecracking shape-shifting green superhero -- whereupon he promptly loses it. But not before impregnating his wife Tonya (Traylor Howard) who nine months later gives birth to a (literally) bouncing baby boy (Ryan Falconer) permanently endowed with Lokis ability to morph into . . . well anything he pleases. Jealous of the new arrival Tims dog finds the mask transforming itself into a chartreuse ball of destructive canine id just as Tonya leaves town (and her hapless hubby) for a business trip. The ""Mr. Mom"" setup is weak enough as it is but Kennedy is tragically miscast as the inept straight-man dad struggling to master diapers while crashing a deadline to complete rough sketches for a new cartoon show hes working on and trying to appease Loki who wants his mask back. Hamstrung by material that calls for Kennedy to muster little besides a look of slack-jawed stupefaction and at his most emotional given to emitting vocalisms that sound like air escaping from a balloon our leading man is soon overwhelmed by a film top-heavy with joyless Tex Avery-style special effects and a dancing-baby bit embarrassingly reminiscent of TVs ""Ally McBeal."" Even Cummings slyly subversive Scottish humor is lost under a pile of costume changes and a flat American accent. Throughout the whole thing Tims boss (Steven Wright) keeps riding Tim telling him that his idea for the new TV show lacks ""spark."" Guess what people? So does this. SON OF THE MASK (PG 86 minutes) -- Contains cartoonish violence a glimpse of a plumbers crack miscellaneous bodily-fluid humor vague sexual innuendo and one mild vulgarity. Area theaters.

Potty humor New dad (Jamie Kennedy) and his jealous dog. New Line Productions But if youre 4 and seeing the PG-rated Son of the Mask why isnt the Internet publishing mug shots of your parents? Icky and incompetent (special effects aside) in equal parts this groaner makes 1994s The Mask look like something youd study in a film graduate course at NYU. Not returning (surprise surprise) are the originals Jim Carrey and then-newcomer Cameron Diaz. This sequel is quite a comedown. The third-tier Jamie Kennedy stars as an emotionally undeveloped animator who isnt ready for children (Ill say) and a wife named Tonya played by Monks Traylor Howard. Nonetheless they conceive a child while hes donning a supernatural mask coveted by a creep named Loki (Alan Cumming in another of his leftover Paul Reubens roles). Looking and acting like someone youd see stalk the mens room at the Cleveland bus station at 2 a.m. Loki is the son of a bearded Norse god (Bob Hoskins in layers of makeup).

He was joyful enough to dominate the special effects instead of the other way around. The genial Jamie Kennedy shows no such power in Son of the Mask. He plays a nebbish who gets turned by the mask into what might be a shellac-haired deeply untame version of Brian Williams complete with glorified Vanilla Ice dance moves. Somebody stop him Since Kennedys flatly ironic white-boy gyrations arent enough to carry the movie everyone in sight gets a shot at masked transformation. Kennedys dog becomes a canine Tasmanian Devil and his infant son conceived during Dads masked night out (the baby does a disco cha-cha to ""Le Freak"" while still in the womb) proves to have such powers as the ability to morph into Woody Woodpecker. The characters twirl around like mini tornadoes but between random brash moments of technological eye-tickling Son of the Mask sags more than it spins.

The net result is a truly numbing experience. Almost surely destined for a brief stopover in theaters before a playdate with DVD. The birth of this decade-later sequel would be easier to dismiss for the manic and mindless exercise that it is if the movie didnt represent a significant technical endeavor replete with splashy special effects. The net result is a truly numbing experience inexplicably aimed at those who were zygotes when Jim Carreys energy powered its ostensible father to box office success. Almost surely destined for a brief stopover in theaters before a playdate with DVD this misbegotten offspring features TV prankster Jamie Kennedy in a leading role though in this case the not-so-funny jokes on him. As with the original ""Son of the Mask"" is positioned as a live-action cartoon yet whatever Warner Bros.-inspired lunacy motivated the first plays here like taking Joe Dantes cinematic tributes to those classic shorts and injecting them with steroids. No one really escapes unscathed but there are probably enough bodily fluid and crotch-kick gags to garner laughs from younger tykes before even their patience wears thin. The only problem is that after an opening sequence detailing Norse mythology -- and how the mask of god of mischief Loki (Alan Cumming) conveys astounding powers on its wearer -- its hard to imagine discriminating parents wanting their kids to partake. There is even something slightly unsavory about the basic premise in which a childlike wannabe animator Tim (Kennedy) is horrified by the prospect of having a baby only to don the mask and impregnate his ridiculously tolerant wife (Traylor Howard). The product of that union is a strange-looking baby possessing masklike powers which he manifests after watching the famous Warner Bros. cartoon ""One Froggy Evening"" which is undoubtedly the best 90 seconds in the movie. Loki meanwhile scours the world searching for the mask while godly father Odin (Bob Hoskins hidden under pretty impressive makeup) threatens to strip him of his powers if he doesnt retrieve it leading to an inevitable (if painfully prolonged) showdown. Director Lawrence Guterman (""Cats amp; Dogs"") and first-time writer Lance Khazei load up on scatological gags and references which is peculiar since the Nickelodeon-watching target audience is unlikely to yuk it up over allusions to ""The Exorcist"" and spaghetti Westerns. Although his WB network hidden-camera show ""The Jamie Kennedy Experiment"" actually had its moments Kennedy plays Tim (whose last name is clearly an homage to animator Tex Avery) in such a cloying juvenile manner -- in essence think of an adult speaking baby talk -- that its painful to endure. The best moments actually belong to the dog Otis (Bear) at least before he inevitably dons the mask and ends up looking like a poor mans Tasmanian Devil. Those effects are generally quite polished including some of the original animation but even the design feels hopelessly derivative -- as do the various permutations of the dancing and talking tot. Although such kid-driven gimmickry is usually crowdpleasing potential laughs get lost amid the mayhem and some of the mask-powered babys behavior simply comes across as creepy. Perhaps the movies strangest aspect however is that amid the silliness it manages to be preachy from touting the joys of parenthood to the moms warning that planting the kid in front of the TV is ""gonna make him stupid."" Sure blame TV. As excuses go that explanation might be as good as any. Son of the MaskProductionA New Line Cinema release of a Radar Pictures production in association with Dark Horse Entertainment.
