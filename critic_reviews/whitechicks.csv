Nevertheless this comedy caper got the green light - perhaps we have its stars sitcom brothers Shawn and Marlon Wayans to thank. Or not. Its hardly a credible affair for starters. Not only do two men clearly wearing hideous rubber masks pass for women but they pass for two specific women notorious party girls under threat of kidnap who must be replaced in the Hamptons (there is at least a spurious plot point to explain why white female FBI agents werent called upon). While the black men teach the Hamptons girls a thing or two about enjoying themselves they learn about womens ways and try to dodge lecherous rich men Some Like It Hot style. Most gags are as weak as they are derivative offering little incentive to suspend ones disbelief and as for the gender politics well... you can only imagine.

In White Chicks the latest slipshod taboo-nudging burlesque from the Wayans brothers a pair of disgruntled FBI agents (Marlon and Shawn Wayans) put on alabaster body paint latex facial padding and blue contact lenses in order to go undercover as the Wilson sisters who coo and roll their eyes and speak in spoiled-rotten Valley patois (""Im so frickin pissed""). The joke it would appear is that the agents could hardly be more different from the vapid Hilton-sister knockoffs theyre impersonating. Yet theres a tickle of surprise - I wouldnt quite call it wit - nestled within the dress-up-doll broadness. Incognito the Wayans brothers may look like twin plastic Halloween masks of Tori Spelling but the real joke is that the aggressive swagger of two cliche African-American law enforcers overlaps in bizarre ways with the bitch-slap hauteur of todays tiara brats. ""White Chicks"" is a tawdry excuse for a movie but it has a handful of shameless giggles. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"Satire in White Chicks hardly goes skin-deep - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Satire in White Chicks hardly goes skin-deep By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 23 2004 The bratty blond socialites Shawn and Marlon Wayans impersonate in ""White Chicks"" are vain shallow ignorant addicted to designer labels rude to people of color and possibly soulless. But white? Not so much.The Wayanses brown skin and long athletic frames are hidden beneath elaborate prosthetic suits and flaxen wigs that make them look alternately like life-size Barbie dolls and the ceramic Michael Jackson of that famous Jeff Koons sculpture subhumanly artificial. Their lack of physical resemblance to actual spoiled dingbats goes unnoticed by everybody in this patchy inept satire.But the movie doesnt care about biological whiteness so much as its cultural twin and on that front the movies timing really couldnt be any better. White girls flaunty entitlement might be displacing hip-hop materialism as popular cultures number one attitude. Lindsay Lohan was thoroughly obnoxious in ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" only to reform and square off against mean girls; the global popularity of Britney Spears cannot be stopped; people love Jessica Simpsons brilliant dimness and cant stop reading best-selling junk food such as ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Bergdorf Blondes."" Meanwhile West Coast princesses Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie run amok again through middle America.Into this explosion of girls behaving badly step the Wayanses comedians capable of spotting the trend (or is it an epidemic?) and brutalizing it. Shawn and Marlon play Kevin and Marcus Copeland two neer-do-well FBI agents given a probationary assignment to escort hotel heiresses the Wilson sisters Brittany and Tiffany (Maitland Ward and Anne Dudek) from their private jet to the Hamptons for Labor Day. Theres a car accident. The girls get scratches on their faces and refuse to be seen with boo-boos. But the Wilsons need to arrive safe and sound or Kevin and Marcus will be fired. So rather than explain the truth to their irritable chief (Frankie Faison) they call in the bureaus masters of disguise to turn them into impostor Wilson sisters who arrive at the Hamptons just in time to fool everybody -- nemeses and fake friends alike -- into thinking that these taller kinder more albino-looking girls are the real things. The actual Wilsons sit and pout somewhere in Manhattan. (Oh I forgot to mention that the sisters are also the objects of a kidnapping plot.)Those waiting to see entitled girls savaged for 100 minutes will probably find ""White Chicks"" the years most disappointing movie. Marlon Shawn and Keenen Ivory Wayans who directs ""White Chicks"" -- and barely -- also made the first two installments of ""Scary Movie"" which showed us white popular culture through black eyes. The view was unprecedented and for the most part outrageous and entertainingly stupid. Only occasionally does the movie which Shawn and Marlon wrote with three other people play fast and loose with racial difference in a way that produces any legitimate laughs. The fake sisters in one very funny example hop in a car with three of the Wilsons pals who flip out when Vanessa Carltons three-year-old preppy ditty ""A Thousand Miles"" comes on the radio (its their ""jam"") and the fake Wilsons encourage them to listen to an R-rated rap song instead. The friends object because it contains the ""N"" word. One sister says ""Nobodys around"" so the whole car breaks into bumptious obscenities.More often the movie makes a beeline for bathroom jokes assorted antics and side plots. Marcus is chasing a pretty journalist while Kevin is running from his suspicious wife and a muscle-bound self-hating playboy whos addicted to white women. The playboy is played by the very funny Terry Crews of ""Baadasssss"" and ""Soul Plane"" who seems to be spending his year stealing scenes in neo-blaxploitation movies. When hes around the movie has the antic spirit of low-low-rent Marx Brothers.Otherwise Keenen Ivory Wayans treats ""White Chicks"" not as burlesque or farce but as an action comedy that wouldnt seem fresh if it came out in 1984. The film feels long when it should be brisk and its bloated with stretches of hot dead air. The racial kitsch goes nowhere. Thats unfortunate White chicks from the Olsens to the Hiltons are here for the skewering but the shabby jabs by the Wayanses mean these sisters will have to do it for themselves.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.White ChicksDirected by Keenen Ivory WayansWritten by Shawn Wayans Marlon Wayans Andy McElfresh Michael Anthony Snowden and Xavier CookStarring MarlonWayans Shawn Wayans Brittany Daniel Terry Crews Frankie Faison Lochlyn Munro Jaime King and John HeardAt Boston Common Fenway suburbsRunning time 111 minutesRated PG-13 (crude and sexual humor language drug content) (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Its about a couple of disgraced FBI agents who transform not only their gender but also their ethnicity until they have become the creatures of the title in order to crack an extremely lame kidnapping conspiracy. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hunternode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hunter;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1087997786309?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hunternode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hunter;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1087997786309?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hunternode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hunter;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1087997786310?""></a> But its not what the Wayans brothers do its how they do it. They do it funny. Older sibling Keenen Ivory directs younger siblings Shawn and Marlon co-write with him and Shawn and Marlon star. Do yourself a favor and take an extended 27.95 popcorn-and-Coke break in the lobby during the flatulence-in-the-fancy-restaurant bit and you might find yourself happier going out than when you went in. Almost nothing formal in the film works. By formal I mean little stuff like oh you know plot setting character believability of milieu dialogue conviction of central device. So whats left? Well the Wayans brothers going downtown way uptown. They play feeble Feebs named Marcus and Kevin Copeland whose job performance has them on the edge of getting fired. Finally given the low-strain task of driving two rich blond sisters to the Hamptons where they will be put under protective observation as a way of capturing a kidnapper they have a minor accident and each of the high-strung girls receives a minor facial laceration. Since the girls are spoiled trivial silly vain ignorant and sullen they refuse to appear in public with bandages and instead decide to spend the weekend in a New York hotel. So the brothers use the FBIs disguise technology to masquerade as the two sisters. They will go up to the prissy glades of far Long Island and sport with the preppies the millionaires the celebs and the wannabes whove turned that neck of the woods into the worlds most exclusive creep zone. Now as a movie illusion this just never begins to work. The two dont look a thing like white chicks. They dont look like black men either. They sort of look like they come from the future rubberized robotoids from the planet of the really cheesy special effects. Their faces arent turned white cosmetically but planted under rubber cheek forms; the result is dead dead dull inexpressive rendered yet more ""I Robot""-like by blond wigs that look like skinned poodles that have been soaking in the Tallahatchie River for years. But as a premise for some good tough sketch comedy the device is brilliant. It affords us a look into a world through strange eyes. When one of them encounters a girl in a dressing room you think Oh here we go cheap boob jokes. But thats not it. What he discovers is a young woman crippled by body anxiety tormented by three extra ounces that she sees as ruining her body and her life since her life is her body. Thats a continuous surprise in the film the Wayanses so immature in so many ways dont use their entree into girl world for tawdry purposes. Quite the contrary and sometimes even movingly they become anchors of faith and self-belief almost psychological medics who apply instant first aid to the many many wounds of bitter girl combat. A continual joke is that as black men strong and body-confident and well-versed in dynamic improvisatory verbal traditions they make superb white chicks. Theyre smarter faster tougher than the rest of the gals and affiliated with a lesser clique they lead their crew to social triumph. And when the white boys condescend to them or cop attitude on them the boys get a lesson fast. Thats whats so good about ""White Chicks"" and often so funny. What else is good about it? Er nothing. White Chicks (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for drug-related humor plus a revolting bathroom-joke sequence.

But as lowbrow comedies go it pretty much delivers. The Wayans brothers vehicle should post fierce early summer numbers with more booty down the road on DVD. Following ""Connie and Carla"" as this years second brazen ""Some Like It Hot"" rip-off ""White Chicks"" poses zero threat to Billy Wilders supremacy. But as lowbrow comedies go it pretty much delivers. While the same concept in blackface would have the PC police reaching for their weapons this caper about two black Feds going undercover as skanky white heiresses scores more hits than misses before stumbling in the final act. More likely to pull urban audiences and women than gagfest rival ""DodgeBall"" the Wayans brothers vehicle should post fierce early summer numbers with more booty down the road on DVD. Scripted by a team that includes director Keenen Ivory Wayans brothers Shawn and Marlon and writing alumni from their various television outings including ""In Living Color"" the comedy skewers easy but irresistible targets in two sets of spotlight-seeking Hilton sister clones and their Hamptons debutante sorority. Most of the best jokes are at the expense of unhip white folks or vacuous rich ho-bags driven by reverse racial stereotyping but the comedy saves a few digs for black dudes and their treatment of pale-skinned trophies. Brothers Kevin and Marcus Copeland (Shawn and Marlon respectively) are low-level FBI agents with a dismal arrest record. Amusing opening has them posing as Latino clerks at a convenience store to make a drug bust. After they arrest the wrong guys and losethe real culprits the brothers are warned by section chief Gordon (Frankie Faison) that one more screw-up will cost them their jobs. When a plot emerges to kidnap socialite sisters Brittany (Maitland Ward) and Tiffany Wilson (Anne Dudek) the Copelands are assigned the thankless task of escorting them safely from the airport to their Hamptons summer hangout while the brothers FBI rivals Gomez (Eddie Velez) and Harper (Lochlyn Munro) get to track the kidnappers. The fragile setup that gets the Copeland boys into the Wilson sisters shoes hardly stands up to scrutiny. En route from the airport Tiffanys pampered dog causes an accident leaving the girls with a scratched nose and a busted lip. Following a major B.F. (bitch fit) they refuse to leave their Gotham hotel suite and jeopardize their chances of making the cover of Hamptons Magazine. Not wanting to bungle their assignment Kevin and Marcus call in their buddies on the latex disguise crew and sashay into socialite central as taller more stacked versions of Brittany and Tiffany. Rather than advancing the narrative in any concrete way the comedys main body serves merely to accommodate a series of silly but often hilarious gags with the faux Wilsons facing off against their ultracompetitive arch rivals Heather (Jaime King) and Megan Vandergeld (Brittany Daniel) whose father Warren (John Heard) is a social kingpin. Backed -- in ""Legally Blonde"" style -- by gal pals Karen (Busy Philipps) Lisa (Jennifer Carpenter) and Tori (Jessica Cauffiel) the Wilsons gain the edge notably in a dance floor showdown where Britt and Tiff shake up the whitebread crowd with some freestyle breakdancing. In a ho-hum romantic detour that steals shamelessly from Tony Curtis exploits in ""Some Like It Hot"" Kevin slips out of drag and into the identity of kazillionaire pro basketballer Latrell Spencer to seduce Denise (Rochelle Aytes) a reporter with a score to settle against pere Vandergeld. More successful is the fixation of the real Latrell (Terry Crews) on Tiffany which becomes increasingly zealous despite Marcus use of gross-out behavior as a deterrent. Final stretch lapses into overplotted chaos as Gomez and Harper figure out the brothers undercover guise just as a clue steers them toward the real kidnapper. Swooping in during the seasons climactic fashion show are Marcus controlling wife (Faune Chambers) the real Wilson sisters the kidnappers stooges and the brothers fellow Feds while the resentful Vandergeld sisters bite back from being shut out with a revenge plan involving Bjork-esque swan dresses and a ""Carrie"" blood-bucket homage. Messy wrap-up comes together serviceably enough however with the boys gaining female-friendly knowledge about how men regard women. Squeezed into microskirts and pastel T-shirts emblazoned with tags like ""Fierce Bitch"" or ""Dude Wheres My Couture?"" the Wayans brothers look like statuesque blond aliens their blue contact lenses giving them a freakishly dead-eyed look. But while theres nothing subtle going on they milk every comic opportunity for surprisingly consistent dividends whether its physical (like chasing down and tackling a bag-snatcher) or verbal (demanding Midol and a Snickers for PMS relief). Some of the best laughs come from the brothers difficulties adapting to the white world. And while theres plenty of fart humor to keep the frat boys happy appealing backup of a slightly more sophisticated model comes from Philipps (playing the polar opposite of her ""Freaks and Geeks"" character) Cauffiel and Carpenter. Crews also has moments while King and Daniel make Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie seem demure. Keenen Ivory Wayans direction is functional enough and craft contributions are clean down the line with Jori Woodmans fun costumes and the transformative makeup by Greg Cannom and Keith Vanderlaan deserving a mention. Soundtrack juggles the expected mix of white and black tunes to keep things moving.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Humor helps White Chicks put a better face forward By Mike Clark USA TODAY With a title like White Chicks (   out of four) you might think ""How sweet that Brady Bunchs Florence Henderson is making a comeback."" But the stars here are two male Wayans -- Marlon and Shawn with brother Keenan Ivory directing -- so its easy to surmise that somethings up. Marlon and Shawn Wayans protect two hotel heiresses in White Chicks. Wonder whom those characters were modeled after? Revolution Studios What we get is a tweaked variation on the litany of men-disguised-as-women comedies Some Like It Hot and Tootsie just for starters. Obviously this sassy farce sounds recycled and certainly appears to be in the coming attraction. Yet its also funnier than expected in ways you wouldnt expect. Two FBI agents played by the Wayans go undercover to foil a kidnapping plot against a pair of ditz sisters/hotel heiresses. Using a storehouse of white latex they disguise themselves as the young women. The hammered-home Paris Hilton connection is inspired and in fact more than half of Chicks non-African-American female characters are blonde spoiled and on their way to terminal rot in the Hamptons. Its this latter satire not the sex switcheroo that makes the movie somewhat of a crudely engaging surprise. There is a funny subplot however involving Terry Crews (who also has a prominent role in the current Baadasssss) as a black basketball player with a white-woman fixation who gets hung up on the blonde version of Marlon. Its hard to imagine anyone but a real stick being offended because the entire movie is so sassy and over the top that just about anything goes. (Sample Wayans dialogue ""Can you guys go get me some Midol and a Snickers?"" and ""Your mothers so dumb that she went to Dr. Dre for a Pap smear."") Six credited writers for a script and three for the story is usually a bad sign but the comedy actually picks up sex-on-the-brain momentum; you begin half-expecting that even villain John Heard will put out a booty call. As with every other genre theres a right way and a wrong way to handle dude-lawman comedies. Chicks does it right a lot of the time.

I mean really stinks. Its an early candidate for worst movie of the year. When I first heard the premise -- black FBI agents going undercover as white debutantes in the Hamptons -- I thought well if the makeup is done right they might be able to say something interesting about race or gender or class in America. Barring that maybe itll be funny. Except the makeup isnt done right. They dont have anything remotely interesting to say about race or gender or class in America. And the first 15 minutes were so bad I decided to count my laughs. That is I decided to see if the movie could make me laugh even once. Im happy to report it did. I laughed 1-1/2 times. In 105 minutes. You do the math. Marlon and Shawn Wayans the unfunniest of the Wayans brothers (no mean feat) play Marcus and Kevin Copeland two gung-ho but hapless FBI agents forever in trouble with ""the Chief"" (Frankie Faison). After botching an undercover job they are given the relatively easy assignment of driving two debutantes the Wilson sisters (Anne Dudek and Maitland Ward) to the Hamptons. Supposedly the Wilson sisters are the targets of a kidnapper and the FBI wants to flush him out. En route theres a minor mishap the Wilsons scratch nose and chin and refuse to leave their hotel room. So violating all protocol the Copelands go undercover as the girls. First the makeup is way creepy. Not only do they not look like the Wilson sisters they dont look human. They reminded me of midstage Hollywood transformation shots -- the latex-laden guys between say man and werewolf or Bruce Banner and the Hulk. But lets suspend belief for a moment. Everyone believes theyre the Wilson sisters and men find them attractive enough to hit on. OK. So what do the Wayans do with this racial/gender turnabout? Movie review Showtimes and trailer No stars ""White Chicks"" with Marlon Wayans Shawn Wayans Frankie Faison John Heard. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans from a screenplay by Keenan Ivory Wayans Marlon Wayans Shawn Wayans Andrew McElfresh Michael Anthony Snowden and Xavier Cook. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor language and some drug content. Several theaters. Supercharged now male inside female black inside white these faux Wilson sisters 1) win a dissing contest against their arch rivals the Vandergeld sisters (Brittany Daniel and Jaime King); 2) win a dance-off against same; 3) say the n-word; 4) foil a purse snatcher; and 5) throw a football real hard. Oh and since white people apparently listen to tinkly little tunes while black folks listen to something known as ""rap"" the girls help introduce this newfangled music to the Hamptons. Subplots include Kevins jealous shrewish wife (Faune Chambers) tracking him down and Marcus romancing a hot TV reporter (Rochelle Aytes). One of the lesser-connected Hamptons girls learns to respect herself. An athlete (Terry Crews) prowls the party scene and zeroes in on Kevins alter-ego. Kevin meanwhile after being a woman learns to be a better man. Of course this lesson makes no sense at all since really hes not that bad a guy. Its his jealous shrewish wife who needs to learn to be a better woman. But what the hey lets just cut-and-paste lessons from other movies into this one. Oh and dont forget about the kidnapping subplot either although for long stretches the movie seems to. You know the saying about success having many fathers and failure being an orphan? Apparently not in Hollywood. Six -- count em six -- screenwriters are attached to this horror show. Which means they can point fingers at each other over lines like Marcus romancing the hot TV reporter. He ""You did all that to find J.Lo and Bens hideaway?"" She ""Well I just love investigative journalism."" A movie this bad should at least be under 100 minutes. They couldnt even get that right.

(AP ... more Photo JOE LEDERER Omigod They totally believe were women -- havent they like seen Tootsie a million times? 1 / 1 Back to Gallery White Chicks. Comedy. Starring Marlon Wayans Shawn Wayans. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. (PG-13. 105 minutes.) Once Marlon and Shawn Wayans start to resemble actual human beings under their heavy makeup -- and that takes awhile -- ""White Chicks"" becomes a surprisingly standard drag comedy. The movie is more concerned with gender relations than race relations and most concerned with appealing to a broad audience. The tame approach is disappointing for a film by the makers of the outrageous ""Scary Movie""(Keenen Ivory Wayans directed and co-wrote the new film with his brothers Marlon and Shawn and three other writers). In ""White Chicks"" the gross-out humor is minimal no character comes off too badly and lessons are learned. Oh Wayanses where are thy teeth? Nearly every funny moment in ""White Chicks"" involves Marlon Wayans the thinner rangier brother. He has turned out to be the most talented actor in a very talented family. As half of an FBI-agent brother team posing as Hilton-sister style celebutantes Marlon transcends the alien effect of the latex white body paint and eerie blue contacts used to turn the brothers into facsimiles of white women. Unlike Shawn who only rarely seems animated in his makeup Marlon adopts a believable ""Omigod"" nose-crinkling manner and high-pitched voice. He enjoys being a girl and more important hes plausible as a girl. Related Stories The Wayans dressed in drag shouldve been funnier / Marlons plausible as a woman but the gags are weak The agents are sent to protect the sisters from a kidnapping attempt but when the ladies refuse to go to the ritzy Hamptons as planned the agents seeking to save their careers pose as them. But the plot hardly matters. The movie exists to put the men-as-women in shopworn drag-comedy situations from a pajama-clad slumber party to an uncomfortable date with a male admirer. The mens transition into female personae provides some funny moments. When a thief nabs the purse of Shawn Wayans socialite the victim responds with a bone-crushing tackle. Marlon Wayans makes the most of a scene where the real girls Prada-clad pals unaware of the impostors encourage a very tight fit during a shopping spree. Squeezed and pinched by a leather getup Wayans displays deft physical comedy in the act of trying to stand erect. The men are aghast at the female pals self-esteem issues. The agents-in-drag braid their friends hair tell them that no they arent fat and advise them against submitting to booty calls. Rarely have bubbleheads been so sympathetically portrayed. The real sisters toss off ethnic slurs a practice the agents continue in drag in order to insult a rival Latino agent. Most of the films race-oriented humor is similarly mild or takes on easy targets like a rich black athlete (Terry Crews) with a yen for white women. Crews an ex-NFL player and talented comic actor elevates this setup investing a stock character with some passion. This man is unfazed when his lovely dinner date (Marlon Wayans) bites her toenails at the table and responds to an endearment with flatulence. The Marlon Wayans characters disdain for this mans unerring lust for white women is the strongest commentary ""White Chicks"" offers. The Wayanses have downplayed the racial equation of the characters black-to-white transformation by setting the film in a rarefied atmosphere. The butt-kissing inspired by the super-rich can hardly be compared to the treatment of middle-class professional people black or white. When the men first don their drag they are most offended by the sexual harassment their female guises engender. Men learning about the female experience by dressing as women is a nice sentiment but ""Tootsie"" had that covered two decades ago. ""White Chicks"" should have tried for more. -- Advisory This film contains raw language gross-out humor innuendo violence.
