E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Who would have guessed that the ""Final Destination series could cling to life for so long - 11 years five movies and scads of grisly impalements and decapitations - without some iconic bogeyman anchoring the franchise? Theres no Ghostface Leatherface Freddy or Jason - just Tony Todd popping up now and again as the mildly creepy messenger giving photogenic calamity dodgers the bad news that Death intends to get them anyway. As far as viscerally hardcore horror goes its jeopardy that qualifies as almost gosh abstract.The 3-D installment ""Final Destination 5 works the atypical-yet-typical formula again this time with a busload of office workers who ditch their ride moments before a catastrophic suspension bridge collapse. Director Steven Quale a James Cameron crew vet apparently hasnt gleaned much about immersive 3-D from his boss but he does deliver the appalling goods for this requisite set piece from lethal breakaway cables to an unfortunately situated sailboat mast. (Picture that famous 1940 footage of an unoccupied Tacoma Narrows Bridge being twisted apart by high winds - only with hapless CG casualties and comin-atcha lethal rebar flying around.)The shouldve-been victims include underassertive Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) whose premonition temporarily saves the group; melancholy Molly (Emma Bell) the girlfriend who has just broken up with him; and a co-worker pool heavy on hotness light on Dunder Mifflin-style wonkery. For story convenience they also moonlight Sams passion is working as a chef putting him in close proximity to cleavers and Frialators while office intern Candice (Ellen Wroe) is a competitive gymnast and clearly headed for a fall. (That is if the arenas precariously dangling ceiling A/C and other diabolically teased safety hazards dont get her first.)Silly plot cheats notwithstanding writer Eric Heisserers script also flashes cleverness from catty dialogue to subtle pop referencing that seems out of touch until a climactic twist explains all. Stabs at the dramatic dont amount to anything that makes us care even for Bell who has been solid on AMCs ""The Walking Dead and in the chairlift chiller ""Frozen. But genre fans who have been thirsting for gore via acupuncture needles or a LASIK machine should get their giddy fill.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

The usual fatalistic events are set in motion by a bridge collapse a spectacular set-piece featuring rippling tarmac clanging girders and twanging wires. Foreseen by Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) while en route to a corporate retreat the disaster spares the Lucky Eight survivors whom Death then stalks for the rest of the movie. It sticks to gimmicky scenes in which twentysomethings are dispatched in ingenious ways but first-time director Steven Quayle delivers cheap fun that will keep fans happy. Its only when writer Eric Heisserer (who penned the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street) foolishly introduces the idea of the doomed being able to save themselves by killing others that the film veers towards superficial unconvincing character motivation.

This is unfair. The Final Destination movies have generally been more clever and watchable (and less mean-spirited) than their Jigsaw-centric counterparts and have done more with their limited formula than Saw has done with its. Saw is flashier though with its emphasis on torture and psychological cruelty. Final Destination deaths tend to be quick and painless for the victim and this is less grueling (and thus less entertaining?) for the audience not to mention less likely to grab headlines when people write about what the kids are watching these days. But if you consider the ideas at the core of the two franchises youll find that Final Destination is far more malevolent. The point of the Saw films is that the Jigsaw-selected neer-do-wells and sad sacks are being given the opportunity to rekindle their joie de vivre through devilish traps that allow them to choose life over death. They are the masters of their fates. Its a stretch and the message is not often well executed in the franchise but its there. The point in Final Destination is exactly the opposite You CANT choose your destiny. When death comes a-callin theres no escaping it no matter how good or noble or righteous you are. Thats some dark philosophy there friends. Such a fatalistic view deserves a sense of humor because hey what are you gonna do but laugh? Morbid mirthfulness was at the heart of the first Final Destination mostly lacking in the abysmal Final Destination 2 back again in Final Destination 3 gone again in Final Destination 4 (aka The Final Destination) and has now returned once more for Final Destination 5. Which isnt to say its a comedy only that its self-awareness is evident in the way it delivers outrageously over-the-top death scenarios that are bound to provoke gasps and laughs in equal measure. Just as funny though perhaps not intentionally is how precisely this fourth sequel follows the established formula. A nondescript young man named Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) has a premonition of a suspension-bridge disaster that is played out before us full of gory death and mayhem. (Its in 3-D too. YOURE WELCOME) Waking from his reverie he urges his cohorts off their bus just in time to escape what turns out to be an actual disaster with the bridge just as he dreamed it. There are seven other survivors his girlfriend (Emma Bell) best friend (Miles Fisher) and best friends girlfriend (Ellen Wroe) token black guy (Arlen Escarpeta) comic-relief horndog (P.J. Byrne) slutty girl (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) and their blustery boss (David Koechner). (They all work at a paper company called Presage. Get it? They dont.) They are spooked after their brush with death more so because Sam somehow predicted it and even more so because then they start dying anyway one by one in the order they should have died on the bridge. A creepy coroner played by Tony Todd (who turned up in a couple previous entries too) dutifully informs them that you cant cheat death which I guess is part of his job as coroner. The rest of the film consists of them trying to cheat death anyway and in the process meeting their separate ends through various rococo sequences of events. Steven Quale a second-unit guy from James Camerons crew getting his first big feature as director focuses his energy on the death and near-death scenes. The opening premonition is nerve-janglingly effective as is a later sequence set on a gymnastics floor. The subsequent deaths are hit-or-miss but they all show some creative spark. Quale sets them up like a cross between a joke and a magic trick carefully establishing crucial details -- a frayed wire a loose screw -- misdirecting our attention a couple times making us anticipate the payoff and then WHAM he hits us with an unexpected punch line. Unfortunately nearly everything in between the death sequences is tedious as if no one bothered to expend any effort on those sections. The writer Eric Heisserer who worked on last years A Nightmare on Elm Street remake manages to find a couple small variations on the familiar theme including a pleasant surprise in the last reel but by and large the dialogue is unimaginative and mechanical. I think everyone understands that the kills are the main attraction here but that doesnt mean its OK to skip over the elements that tie them together. That kind of laziness is disappointing in what is otherwise a scrappy underdog horror franchise.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Aug. 11 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 12 2011 1057AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Death doesnt like to get cheated again in Final Destination 5 the latest movie in the horror series that goes back to 2000. In each film a group of young people narrowly escape a collective disaster only to die subsequently in a succession of gruesome and improbably elaborate ways. Repeating the basic setup of its predecessors Final Destination 5 introduces a group of office workers from a paper company boarding a bus for a corporate retreat. Salesman and aspiring chef Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) has a sudden premonition of disaster as the bus drives onto a suspension bridge (Vancouvers Lions Gate Bridge) imagining his colleagues crushed impaled and dismembered in various spectacular ways. He demands that the bus stop narrowly saving himself and seven fellow employees from catastrophe. The survivors whom the media dub The Lucky Eight include his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell) and high-strung friend Peter (Miles Fisher). Relief is soon followed by foreboding at a company funeral where a creepy coroner (Tony Todd) warns that Death doesnt like to take ""Later Dude"" for an answer. The first victim a young woman gymnast fatally dismounts from the uneven bars in a position that would baffle even a Cirque du Soleil contortionist. By the time the survivors are down to the Lucky Five a detective ( Law and Orders Courtney B. Vance) applies his sleuthing logic ""Two is a coincidence"" he intones. ""Three is ... a pattern."" As the survivors realize theyre being systematically harvested by the Grim Reaper they race around town trying to save each other. Director Steven Quale (previously known for his effects and second unit work with James Cameron) stages the death scenes with intermittently effective black humour to juice up a premise that essentially has all the suspense of watching the line at an abattoir. Consequently each death scene is a slow tease as we try to guess which flickering light bulb loose screw acupuncture needle dripping pipe or dangling hook is going to deliver the coup de grace. ""Six systems had to fail for this to happen"" points out Vances number-conscious detective after a fatal mishap at a laser eye surgery clinic. And his analysis doesnt even include the teddy bears glass eye on the floor. Screenwriter Eric Heisserer (who wrote last years A Nightmare on Elm Street reboot) introduces a new wrinkle to the Final Destination mythology Victims can escape their destiny by offering a fresh corpse in their place. But the idea is developed only enough to justify an inessential action scene at risk of contradicting the plots premise that each persons exit is pre-determined. Acting demands here are appropriately minimal - terror followed by moments of false relief then more terror. Veteran Final Destination fans know it really doesnt pay to get emotionally invested in the fates of the clueless victims. Periodically thanks to the 3-D a long and pointy object emerges from the screen threatening to impale the viewers through their eyeballs enhancing the movies guilty pleasure by reminding us that we too are made of vulnerable flesh and bone.

And happily for those of us who enjoy the FD2011-08-21Warner Bros. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr FINAL DESTINATION 5 Not the best vision plan at this office B Final Destination 5 Genre Horror; Starring Nicholas DAgosto; Release Date Wide 08/12/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 92; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 21 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT In Final Destination 5 Death makes the point yet again that it will not be cheated. And happily for those of us who enjoy the FD series grotesquely clever premise beyond reason unfortunate folks still refuse to pay attention with inventively dire consequences. Its been twelve years since Flight 180 exploded in the original Final Destination way back in a pre 9/11 universe when a gaggle of high school kids meant to expire in the explosion survived instead -- all because one teen with a premonition saved a handful of his classmates. Of course as a result those ""lucky"" survivors threw the laws of the horror-movie universe off balance. Which is why each expired in one exotic way or another in the months that followed. Now a dozen years later Death -- personified by franchise stalwart and Candyman star Tony Todd as an excellently creepy coroner -- demonstrates what happens to those who dont pay attention to cosmic rules. Alas its no longer pretty vapid teens who meet their untimely ends in this efficient albeit mechanical edition. But at least its a group of pretty vapid co-workers at a paper company -- a nice shout-out to The Office -- who are shafted. Theyre also boiled broken sliced drowned fried burnt crushed and in one instance pierced by acupuncture needles. Sam (Nicolas DAgosto from Heroes) is the newest dude with a pesky premonition this time that the bridge over which he and his coworkers are traveling on a corporate bus trip is about to collapse. Among the (temporarily) saved are Emma Bell (The Walking Dead) as Sams ambivalent girlfriend; Miles Fisher (Gossip Girl) as Sams coworker and best friend; and P.J.Byrne (Horrible Bosses) as the office slimeball a guy not above rifling the desks of his already deceased coworkers for anything worth filching. For a dose of Thespian Grandeur Courtney B. Vance joins in as an investigating agent. Just because its always a pleasure to see him David Koechner (from The Office -- another shout-out) plays the groups less-than-beloved boss. And just for the many people who enjoy watching gymnastics on TV theres a deliciously anxiety-filled scene involving a young competitor (Ellen Wroe in her feature debut) and a loose screw. Under the direction of James Cameron protege Steven Quayle the visual effects from Ariel Velasco Shaw (who has crafted mayhem on everything from 300 to Freddy vs. Jason) ensure that no industrial hook through a skull is left unimagined. And speaking of hooks if theres got to be a trendy-if-unnecessary 3D application it might as well be applied to flying objects of death whooshing with cheerfully deadly aim towards audience eyeballs.

Again splattering heads into the third dimension the latest in the gruesome supernatural-slasher franchise is so tapped into its audiences giddy schadenfreude that beyond a kinkier-than-usual jolt of black humor and some clever red herrings the formula remains rote Moments before a busload of young coworkers on a corporate retreat are crushed impaled and/or flame-broiled in a breathtakingly staged collapse of a suspension bridge one unlucky survivor (Nicholas DAgosto) has a play-by-play doomsday premonition and freaks out unnerving others enough that they escape with him to ""safety"" before the vision comes true. Shadowy coroner Tony Todd turns up for his fourth paycheck to offer grave warnings about Death hating to be cheated and soon everyone is falling like dominoes each the victim of a bizarre icky tortuous chain reaction that would either make Rube Goldberg proud or throw up.

Thanks Angussaid on Monday August 22 2011 54433 PMGBB would be a great name for a band...except it would carry some heavy expectations. Well unless it was a clean-cut band playing up the irony. Jonathan Lemmonsaid on Wednesday August 17 2011 54149 PMI loved the first Final Destination and the second one was a really good follow-up. The third one was a bit of a set back but it was still a good movie. I absolutely hated the fourth movie despite some cool action sequences including the intense but absolutely implausible climax. I mean who puts barrels of gasoline behind a movie theatre anyway? It was a suspenseful scene no doubt but completely wasted with idiotic writing. After hearing that they were making a fifth movie I thought why? After all the fourth movie was called THE Final Destination. It seems pointless to make a fifth film. But after watching your review youve given me some hope that this could be the ""FINAL"" Final Destination movie weve wanted since FD3. But Im still going to catch it on DVD. And if they do deside to make Final Destination 6 The REAL Final Destination lets hope they make it more like this movie and not like the fourth. Nicksaid on Saturday August 13 2011 115142 AMThe Tom Cruise look-a-like is a pretty talented musician. Though it looks like he still has a long way to go before becoming a talented actor. -Nick Nicksaid on Saturday August 13 2011 114318 AMGreat review. As a film critic in training I admire your work and someday hope to enjoy your level of movie expertise. I love that you can see a film like this and acknowledge its merits even if you dont like the movie overall. Though I am constantly working to find my own voice in film criticism it is your work that I strive to be like. http//nicksmoviereviews.com/ - Nick Carl The Criticsaid on Saturday August 13 2011 112435 AMGBB LOL that is awesome.

"Final Destination 5 Tedium reigns in latest installment of gory horror franchise |       NJ.com comments Final Destination 5 Tedium reigns in latest installment of gory horror franchise Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 12 2011 at 803 AM updated August 12 2011 at 935 AM View/Post Comments Warner Bros.Jacqueline MacInnes Wood and Nicholas DaAgosto run for their lives in aFinal Destination 5.a You could go buy a ticket for ""Final Destination 5."" Or you could sit in your living room and have a friend throw sharp objects at your head. The first option is definitely safer. The second is admittedly more dangerous. But the result would be exactly the same -- a lot of squirming a little bit of nauseous hyperventilating and a great deal of ducking. And at least Plan B is cheaper. ""Final Destination 5"" is obviously the fourth sequel to the original ""Final Destination"" which came out more than a decade ago. In that little charmer a group of friends heeded a pals premonition and refused to board a plane. It then crashed. They had cheated death. Except death hates a cheater. And so one by one the friends died anyway -- in the most preposterous accidents imaginable. It wasnt a bad idea for a spooky little horror film; minus the gore you could almost imagine it as an episode of ""The X-Files"" (in fact the original writers had worked for that show) or maybe one of those clammy Korean shockers that used to show up in art houses. But did we really need four more films of callow catalog-pretty young people getting skinned skewered sauteed and otherwise turned into blue-plate specials only occasionally interrupted by character actor Tony Todds ghoulish chuckle? Apparently yes -- as long as the movies kept making money. Its the same pattern here with only the gory deaths changing. But then thats what the fans turn out for anyway in a sort of watch-this dare whose appeal is closer to the carnival than the cinema. Admitted there is a certain inventiveness to the way director Steven Quale stages the violence making you confidently predict a half-dozen ways the character is going to die -- and then tricking you by coming up with a seventh. Its usually household objects too -- frayed wires improperly bolted shelves scented candles. They should use this as a training film for insurance agents. Theyd sell a lot of new policies. But theres not much more to the movie than that -- a long and eventually tedious series of deaths all in slightly sickening 3-D. Splattered eyeballs snapped spines heart kebabs -- one numbingly after another in diamond-hard focus and ruby-red color. What isnt here is -- well everything else that goes into a normal movie. Like a sense of place (the cars have New York plates the landscape looks like California and the streets are Canadian). Or any agreeable actors among the victims (Nicholas DAgosto is a blank; Miles Fisher comes off like the love child of Tom Cruise and the Fonz). Or anything resembling wit. Well there is one small good joke at the end meant for diehard fans that ends this film where the first one began -- and suggests that the entire five-film experience may have been a kind of Mobius strip of gore fated to repeat over and over and over again. And that may be the most unspeakable horror of all. Ratings note The film contains graphic gore violence sexual situations strong language and alcohol abuse. Final Destination 5 (R) Warner Bros. (92 min.) Directed by Steven Quale. With Miles Fisher Tony Todd. Now playing in New Jersey.

Glee 3D Concert Movie Songs for Gleeks Cleavage for Straight Guys The good news The 3D by James Cameron cohort Steve Quale is way better than average Finally you can cheat death in a ""Final Destination"" movie. Just take someone elses life -- adding your victims years to your own. Its not only the only twist in the new ""Final Destination 5"" its a philosophical conundrum square in the middle of the least philosophical franchise ever. As usual for the series director Steven Quale delivers shocking scenes of horrifying murder and mutilation. But there is this Quale shot second unit on James Camerons ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar""; for the latter he was responsible for much of the groundbreaking 3D technology. He employs it to superlative effect here. ""FD 5"" may reek in the acting department but Quale is sure-handed with narrative montage ratcheting up the tension as the reaper closes in with outlandish coincidence that makes even a massage parlor a potential death trap. As for the story once again its a case of set it up and then let the bloodbath begin. And so it starts with young Sam Lawton (Nicholas DAgosto) on a tour bus to a company retreat when he has a startling vision of a bridge collapse with each of his friends meeting gruesome Wile E. Coyote-like deaths. Snapping out of his nightmarish reverie Sam herds his friends and whoever will listen off the bus only to see it consumed in a collapse matching his vision. Unfortunately DAgosto loosely anchors the movie in a wan and passive manner. His roots are in TV and he appears lost on the big screen although screenwriter Eric Heisserers alarmingly inept ear for dialogue doesnt help matters much. Miles Fisher plays the companys ethically challenged alpha male a role by which he oddly channels Tom Cruise delivering a hackneyed performance as he struggles with a character arc that barely makes sense. Veteran actor Courtney B. Vance acquits himself well in a limited role as a cop and David Koechner as the typically clueless office manager gets a few hardy laughs. But per usual ""Final Destination 5"" only becomes watchable when people are perishing in ways so outlandish that they border on self-parody. There are at least as many laughs as there are scares such as when one poor victim has his face caved in by a stone Buddha or when a gymnast fumbles on a difficult dismount landing like a pretzel. Its a hoot if you can stomach it. The concept for the original ""Final Destination"" back in 2000 was a sound one -- for the cheap thriller that it was. To stretch it to a five-picture franchise is youll pardon the pun overkill. It has over the years become nothing more than a celebration of graphic gore and pain meant to elicit chills and laughter.

The spectacular bridge collapse that begins ""Final Destination 5"" answers the question that always occurs to me on my infrequent excursions across the GW Bridge What would happen if one of these cables snapped? Now that the movie has provided a colorful illustration of the answer I think Ill just stay in Manhattan for the rest of my life. I had my doubts about New Jersey anyway. As ""Rosemarys Baby"" fit the Manson era and ""Friday the 13th"" captured 1980 teens nervousness about sex the ""Final Destination"" series provides a clever brand of generation-specific horror. These movies romp with the idea of bike-helmet babies coming of age as the infrastructure around them crumbles. ""Final Destination 5"" which despite its lowbrow story turns out to be one of the fastest-moving films of the year is a suspenseful and macabre exercise in dread for the absurdly cosseted. Young adults born in the 1980s and early 1990s leaped out of nicotine- and alcohol-free wombs to be deemed geniuses every time they passed a test awarded trophies every time they caught a ball and tucked into comfy car seats on the victory ride over to their favorite sushi palace. They took groovy public-service internships at an age when their grandfathers were sweating on assembly lines or being shot at by Nazis lived with their parents until they were 28 then proceeded directly to their shrinks for marathon weeping sessions every time they messed up a project at work. Theyre as soft as pudding and they know it. The Greatest Generation didnt need triathlons or X-treme skateboarding; every Friday night was a thrill ride after manual labor and eight Schlitzes. ""FD5"" like other films in the series depends heavily on the witty machinations of the screenplay. It keeps coming up with ridiculously bloody answers to questions like How might you die in a brutal massage mishap? To a highly trained gymnast could a balance beam prove your undoing? And What could possibly go wrong during laser eye surgery? As usual Death comes to cash a few checks after a group of young people narrowly escapes the opening catastrophe. Most of the characters are fatally bland while others are aggressively loathsome especially P.J. Byrnes Isaac a sleazy skirt chaser who when 18 of his co-workers are killed steals spare change and anything else he can find in their desks. He lifts a coupon for a free massage at the local spa where the employees are Asian women. ""Yum yum dim sum"" he says ogling a pair of delicious-looking um sweet buns. Isaacs demise is the most hilariously engineered involving a crazy series of sudden reversals of fortune and Byrnes sporting performance makes the most of his big scene. Other actors notably the three leads (Nicholas DAgosto Miles Fisher and Emma Bell) dont make much of an impression but thats OK. As with goldfish you shouldnt get too attached to any ""Final Destination"" characters. A lot of damage in these films results from old standbys such as car and airplane crashes but theres a sense that Death is bored by such easy pickings. The brilliance of the movies is that if you look too closely around you the world starts to look very Final Destination. A fan whines an electrical cord is frayed a screw comes loose and any of these things (or more likely all of these things) can ruin your day. Previous generations constructed an amazing world -- but nothing new gets built anymore and now all the old stuff is being held together by rust. The millennials who keep flocking to these movies do so out of a vague sense of feeling spoiled and cheated at the same time. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Sesame Street says Bert and Ernie are best friends -- do...

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 12 2011 400 AM Title Final Destination 5 Horror sequel about friends stalked by Death. With Nicholas DAgosto David Koechner. Director Steven Quale. (132). R language extreme violence. At area theaters.You didnt really believe number four was going to be the final ""Destination"" did you? If there is blood to be drawn from a stone youll find a dozen studio execs standing around with drills. Given the regularity of this approach its inevitable that every once in a while theyll hit a gusher.And so its happened that first-time feature director Steven Quale has brought this anemic franchise back to life with an unexpected infusion of humor and energy.Dont misunderstand ""Final Destination 5"" will not go down as a classic of its genre. But theres no doubt itll pave the way for sequel number six.If that sounds like faint praise well theres only so much you can do with a formula that experienced rigor mortis years ago. As ever we open with a terrifying scene in which a generically attractive twentysomething predicts and then avoids ghastly destruction. In this case our disposable hero is Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) whose fast thinking saves his colleagues from a horrific bridge collapse.What hes about to learn of course is that Death will not be cheated.And so Sams coworkers (David Koechner being the only recognizable one) are killed off in increasingly appalling fashion. Though his best friend (Miles Fisher) has a plan to save the remaining survivors its no spoiler to note that in this series body counts must be high and the End will always be brutal.But in contrast to the grim slog thats defined the ""Saw"" cycle ""FD"" is as sly as it is sadistic. So Quale cheerfully teases the audience throughout setting up outrageous accidents for each victim and then adding an extra-nasty twist at the last second. An experienced visual effects supervisor he also has a fine time exploiting the 3-D format tossing every imaginable weapon our way. There may not be much suspense--unlike the confused FBI agent on the case (Courtney B. Vance) we all know how this will finish--but Quale and screenwriter Eric Heisserer do keep us on edge. Better still they share an evident affection for the original with unexpected cameos and winking references leading up to what can only be called a killer finale. Magic moment Who knew there were so many hazards lurking in every corner of a kitchen?

Final Destination 5 review Fatal attraction 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Final Destination 5 Horror thriller. Starring Nicholas DAgosto Emma Bell Arlen Escarpeta and Miles Fisher. Directed by Steven Quale. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Death doesnt like to be cheated so following the miraculous escape of eight people from a suspension-bridge disaster ... things start happening. These things that happen? Oh theyre bad but not just bad. They are elaborate and obliterating and unsettling and extremely funny so that audiences end up laughing yelling and gasping at the same time. Its a startled ridiculous sound that people make and you will make it about 10 ten times yourself if you go see ""Final Destination 5."" What else is there to say? Wait let me look at my notes. ""Great when the car lands on her head."" Indeed yes that was one of many highlights when the car lands on the womans head. Not good for the car not good for the woman dont try this at home. What a strange thing this is. ""Final Destination 5"" is irresistible and the reason its irresistible is that it speaks to us in the language we all understand which is fear. If eternal beings came to earth and watched ""Final Destination 5"" they would see it as a curious documentary. Only if they watched it with a human audience would they be moved and then only by the audience because people go nuts for this. This is a comedy about death. The movie makes audiences omniscient and above it all and yet awakens them to their vulnerability forcing them to see the danger in everything. Its funny and appalling the most obvious schlock and yet so effective that theres no point arguing with it. The formula - its not broke why fix it? - is by now familiar. A group of young people gets on a transportation vehicle in this case a bus heading toward an employee retreat. Everything seems to be going routinely and then Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) observes that the suspension bridge theyre on has begun to collapse which is not a good thing. He runs off the bus and others follow and over the ensuing five minutes were treated to a spectacular disaster with cars tumbling into the sea and individual characters getting killed in gruesome and spectacular ways. But wait. That was just a vision a premonition of the immediate future. Now with a warning of 30 seconds to a minute Sam jumps up and leads a party off the bus this time in reality. This means we get to see the bridge collapse again - just as vivid from another angle. And we have a group of survivors each of whom are available to be killed again. You see they were meant to be on that bridge and so its just a matter of time before ... death catches up. The rest is a game played between the movie and the audience. The movie tells us who is going to be killed in what order. In a sense the filmmakers tie one hand behind their back and say ""Were going to surprise you any second now. You just dont know when or how."" The scene in which a young gymnast goes through a routine is a beautiful example of successful comic suspense. The movie sets up a number of ways in which she might be killed and still shocks. Being the fifth installment in the ""Final Destination"" this means that people or persons are getting enormously rich from this but thats only right. Inventions like the light bulb and the phonograph are a lot easier to respect but there is a place for more humble creations like the Frappuccino and the ""Final Destination"" series which do absolutely nothing except liven up the day.

By Doane Gregory Warner Bros. Pictures Stayin alive? Nicholas DAgosto and Emma Bell try to elude Death in Final Destination 5 . EnlargeClose By Doane Gregory Warner Bros. Pictures Stayin alive? Nicholas DAgosto and Emma Bell try to elude Death in Final Destination 5 . Nor apparently does it like to clean up after itself if this grisly installment of the horror franchise is any indication. The latest entry in the never-say-live Grim Reaper series is arguably the best (modest praise granted). It adds a touch of humor and even offers a few knowing winks to previous installments. The Godfather II it isnt but for teens with money to burn there are worse options to curdle blood. Once again Destination begins with young people who narrowly escape death this time a suspension bridge collapse that makes mincemeat of other motorists. The effect is terrific and reminiscent of the bridge destruction from Mission Impossible III. The kids escape a carcass-full of body piercings when Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) has a premonition of a bumpy ride and leads his friends to safety -- for now. But as the previous Destinations have taught us Death does not suffer survivors lightly and it begins a macabre hunt for kids on borrowed time. Even by todays horror standards Destination has some ghastly scenes. After seeing them parents may want to reconsider letting their daughters try gymnastics or laser eye surgery. Final Destination 5   1/2 out of four Stars Nicholas DAgosto Emma Bell P.J. Byrne Director Steven Quale DistributorWarner Bros. Rating R for violent/gruesome accidents and some language Running time 1 hour 32 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Speaking of which first-time feature-film director Steven Quale infuses Destination with characters who offer moments of sharp humor particularly a dolt who cant rip his ear from his cellphone until well his head is ripped from his ear. All of this could have added up to pedestrian schlock kids venturing into the woods to check out mysterious noises. But Destinations victims are savvy in the way kids were in Scream. And finally 3-D is employed the way it should be with jump-out-of-your-seat scares. Impaled victims licking flames shattering glass -- horror may have found a home in the third dimension. Sure its still modern-day horror. Five minutes into the movie youll know which characters deserve to be chopped liver and which ones caught the Reaper on a bad day. And the message of the franchise has always been something of a puzzler Dont fight for your life? But for mindless horror this isnt a terminal destination.

Credit Warner Brothers Pictures The fifth installment of the ""Final Destination"" series begins with the usual 10 minutes of fun. An elaborately choreographed disaster in this case a bridge collapse eliminates a group of teenagers in entertainingly disgusting ways before being revealed as a premonition. This allows some of the group to avoid death so that they can be killed again -- in slower more stomach-churning fashion -- over the rest of the film.Few horror cycles are as consistently true to their formulas and ""Final Destination 5"" directed by Steven Quale hits all its marks dream escape official suspicion theme song (""Dust in the Wind"" this time) and Tony Todd  who returns as Bludworth the voice of cheated death after taking the fourth movie off.""Its just that Ive seen this before"" he says a line thats too depressingly true to be funny.A new wrinkle in how the killings spool out actually makes the film even more predictable and the deaths which tend to be squirmy rather than explosive (a scene in an eye doctors office could be a deal breaker for some) are so perfunctory and lazily jokey that they leave a decidedly bad aftertaste.

Thats not the case with Final Destination 5 an anemic installment in the decade-old series that seems content with giving viewers more of the same. Even the 3-D aspect is recycled from the 2009 edition.Much of the series entertainment at least until the novelty quickly wore off came from its clever premise A stereotypical group of ill-fated beautiful young people survives a horrific accident (a plane crash massive highway pile-up subway crash five-hour Academy Awards ceremony etc.) after one of them has a fate-changing vision of impending doom.Death doesnt like to be cheated though and relentlessly picks them off one at a time in the order in which they should have died. The twist is that Death isnt the umpteenth slasher haunted house or supernatural bogeyman but an unseen force that prefers not to wait for old age high cholesterol or household accidents to take their toll.Instead Death manipulates the environment with a Rube Goldbergian flair so that a loose bolt here a leaky faucet there or some other innocuous circumstance will trigger a fatal and usually gory chain of events.This time around were introduced to a group of paper-mill employees that boards a chartered bus for a weekend team-building retreat. One of them Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) dozes off during a traffic jam on a suspension bridge and has a vision of their impending deaths caused by the bridges collapse (an impressive spectacle and the movies only gripping moment). Sam is able to save himself and seven others though all he has really done is to delay the inevitable.Veteran horror-movie actor Tony Todd (Candyman Hatchet II) reprises his role as coroner William Bludworth from the series first two installments just long enough to explain to the cast what theyre in for. He also clues them in to the fact that they can save themselves by each taking someone elses life to ""balance the scales"" a twist that serves only to set up one of the group as a villain. A murderous free-for-all might have put a new spin on things.Nobody goes to these types of movies for the plot though; the appeal here is in the inventively elaborate means that Death concocts to catch its prey. Thats where Final Destination 5 falls apart because Death seems so bored with the whole routine that its heart just isnt in it.One characters gymnastic practice gone awry uses enough feints to keep us squirming with dread; otherwise the set-ups arent very creative and are usually perfunctory or designed only to cause prolonged agony before sending the victim out a window or squishing him or her under something heavy. Ridiculously contrived can be overlooked but ridiculously contrived with no pay-off leaves one feeling cheated.Terminal boredom sets in long before the twist ending. At one point Todd says ""Its just that Ive seen this all before."" Sadly so have we.Final Destination 5D Starring Tony Todd Nicholas DAgosto Emma Bell Miles Fisher Courtney B.

"Final Destination 5 Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Final Destination 5Yeah you know where this one is heading a its a really bad bus trip for all the pretty ones on this deadly ride. Oh horrorsAugust 12 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Emma Bell left Nicholas DAgosto and Miles Fisher in ""Final... (Doane Gregory / Warner Bros....)This is one of those times when I really wish I could borrow James Earl Jones to do a Darth Vader reading so youd get that echo chamber of doom effect. Since I cant just use your imagination. Ready? ""Final Destination 5"" Prepare to diea|. Or maybe ""Final Destination 5"" Prepare to groan.... Actually you should prepare to do both though if youre a fan of the franchise (Really? Youre reading this?) you no doubt know what youre in for already. This is after all the series that from the beginning has asked the question a How many ways can characters be killed? a and in the completely totally nothing-but-literal sense. Although theyll try to suggest there are deeper themes of predestination determinism and fate on the table dont let them fool you; ""FD 5"" is no philosophical excursion. It is however a really bad bus trip for all the pretty ones whove been invited along for this deadly (metaphorically speaking) ride. I will say the bus and the bridge it must cross does make for a pretty incredible wham-bam opening sequence but more on that later. In the not-so-grand tradition of ""Final Destination"" death is no laughing matter. Well I take that back it sometimes is and ""FD 5"" is the funniest yet. But the real raison dAatre for ""FD"" filmmakers and there have been a few since it first drew blood in 2000 is to see just how many kills can be stacked up and how many body parts can be sliced and diced along the way. You can just hear the giggles in the editing bay a the grosser the better hee hee hee. And lets be brutally honest If a ""Final Destination"" movie cant wring a handful of collective groans and gasps and eeewwwwws out of its audience its really not doing its job. I have to hand it to them (imagine severed hand tendons trailing flying toward your head at warp speed) a the killing here is nothing if not inventive in a very campy way. This is the second time ""FD"" has come to us in 3-D and for that they couldnt have done better than bringing in Steven Quale to direct. Its his first time in the directors chair on a feature film but hes been an apprentice to the great wizard a James Cameron a off and on for 20 years. ""Avatar"" brought Quales most recent credit as second-unit director a truly the unsung heroes of action moviemaking usually doing those scenes that require days of tedious rigging to make massive things collapse and crumble in a split second. Quale kicks things off with a suspension bridge jam-packed with cars and wouldnt you know it its undergoing major renovation with lots of heavy equipment blasting and cutting through concrete. The big crumble is a stunner of an opener that introduces us to the hyperactive hyperbolic in-your-face style Quale intends to use for the rest of the movie. He does a bang-up job of sending things flying and he slays the death scenes. Its the living creatures required to speak the clunky dialogue that kill him. The opening also serves to introduce us to all the major players that Death has his eye on. Those bodies would be Nicholas DAgosto Emma Bell Miles Fisher Jacqueline MacInnes Wood P.J. Byrne Arlen Escarpeta and Ellen Wroe who all work at the same company. The films grown-ups include David Koechner (""The Office"") as the unlikable boss and Courtney B. Vance as the detective charged with investigating the deaths we all know are coming. Id mention their character names if it mattered but it doesnt. As always Death is upper-case a major player even when he (I like to think of him as a he though we dont really know do we?) is just implied. Unless that guy in the dark coat named Bludworth (Tony Todd) who always shows up at the crime scene along with the ominous music is nah never mind. The cliff-hanging questions raised by screenwriter Eric Heisserer (2010s remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"") are Did Death actually take a holiday this time? Can someone defy fate? Can we make the ""Caution"" road signs any bigger? Can we make a smoking gun actually smoke? What ""Final Destination 5"" does not have is any fear factors. I am a really easy mark when it comes to scary movies a ""Poltergeist"" freaked me out ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (the original) required years of therapy and ""Hellraiser"" well that I will never fully recover from. But ""FD 5"" did not raise even a single goose bump a which for a movie that bills itself as horror is not a good thing. The camp factor however is high and makes the 95 minutes pretty much fly by. The movie never reaches the cleverness of ""Scream"" but then it doesnt take itself too seriously either a and neither should you. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFinal Destination franchise lives onAugust 11 2011Movie Review aThe City of Your Final DestinationaApril 23 2010Avatar rockets to solid openingDecember 21 2009Hollywood hopes for a game changer in AvatarNovember 15 2009An odd couple with OscarsDecember 1 2002MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentJames CameronCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-final-destination-20110812,0,2497323.story?track=rss",200,finaldestination517,finaldestination5,latimes

More about Final Destination 5 >> Whats good is that the fifth pic the aptly titled 3-D entry Final Destination 5 carries on the august FD tradition inaugurated in 2000 by writer-director James Wong and also manages to crank up the blood gore grizzle and grue to 2011 and beyond. Id venture to say its the best Final Destination sequel - if you gauge success by overall shock value. Whats bad is that it carries on the august tradition . . . Final Destination 5 opens on a high The opening credit sequence is a heady 3-D phantasmagoria a swirly trippy sequence of glass shards knives poles iron rods and various other implements of death flying at the audience. (They even threw a flying salami in there. Now that would be a spicy death.) Its the best part of the film. Then we get the familiar opening scene Our hapless hero a likable cute (if a tad too vanilla) sincere-head everyman named Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) has a vision of impending doom as hes traveling to a corporate retreat with a busload of coworkers. (In The Office style theyre all Dilbertian drones at a paper plant bossed over by a bald insecure mamas boy turned dictator.) Sam sees the bridge collapse sending screaming men women and children to the deep watery yonder below. (Well those who havent been chopped into two by snapping cables.) A dozen human beings worth of limbs bloodied limbless torsos and severed heads fly right at us. (Goody) Before his vision becomes reality Sam saves seven souls. The rest is a by-the-numbers iteration of the standard plot line Sam and his fellow survivors including his girlfriend Molly (the lovely Emma Bell whose talents are wasted here) have cheated death So the Grim Reaper comes for them one by one. Director Steven Quale is economical He ditches plot altogether delivering instead nothing but set pieces. He does come up with a few genuinely creepy moments of Hitchcockian edge-of-your-seat suspense and a few very inventive deaths. And the film ends with a sweet wicked series of plot twists. For what its worth Final Destination 5 will please the series fans in a big way. Contact Inquirer staff writer Tirdad Derakhshani at 215-817-2164 or tirdadphillynews.com.

"Chicago Tribune Michael Phillips Final Destination 5 review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Final Destination becomes a bridge too farDeath comes around again in predictable fashion chasing dullards -- 2 starsAugust 11 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Final Destination 5"" starring a million shards of glass and several interchangeably dull young actors plus a couple of good ones continues this sick-joke franchises focus on the downside of the machine age with its loose screws and unreliable bolts and drippy air conditioning units and sharp pointy extremities just waiting for a target. In 3-D""Final Destination 4"" was in 3-D and so is ""F D 5."" Id rather see a documentary about the peaceable versatile uses of WD-40 but you know teenagers. They wouldnt go to ""WD-40 The Movie"" unless it came with some ""heinous kill sequences"" as screenwriter Eric Heisserer calls the heinous kill sequences in ""F D 5.""En route by bus to a corporate team-building exercise the sales and administrative staffs of a paper company more indolent than Dunder Mifflin run into trouble on a suspension bridge unusually susceptible to high winds and the screenplays need for a big opening. Seconds before the carnage nice guy Sam (Nicholas DAgosto one of the good ones) whod rather be cooking and living in Paris with girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell the other good one stoic even when shes freaking out) is stricken by a detailed premonition of the bridge disaster and its attendant impalings and is therefore able to save a few lives when Fate does that voodoo that Fate does so well.But Death in the form of purring whistling franchise regular Tony Todd (as Bludworth) needs his fatalities and ""F D 5"" offers up the expected chain reactions of doom often involving water and electricity. First-time feature film director Steven Quale working from Heisserers script delivers the gore with impersonal efficiency as the story winds its way back to ... well thats a spoiler I suppose. If more of the picture had the inventively grotesque payoff of the scene set at the gymnastics tryout capped by a female characters inarguably poor dismount we might have something to puke home about.mjphillipstribune.comFinal Destination 5 -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violent/gruesome accidents and some language)Cast Nicholas DAgosto (Sam); Emma Bell (Molly); Miles Fisher (Peter); Courtney B.

Final Destination 5 Rating Director Steven Quale Cast Nicholas DAgosto Emma Bell and Arlen Escarpeta. Rating R for strong violent/gruesome accidents and some language. This weeks new movie releases Make that sequels about death - teen-oriented exploitation movies in which generic young actors meet their fates in a series of gruesome occasionally suspenseful scenes. The latest of these ""Final Destination 5"" isnt as novel as it hopes to be but it gets the job done. The top 10 entertaining movie deaths More playful than the old ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" series of hunt-the-kids-down flicks the ""Final Destination"" series offered something new. Here the villain isnt a nasty mask-wearing man wielding knives; its fate itself a sense that the entire physical world is loaded with inevitable death for those who somehow evade the Reaper the first time he comes calling. The camera in ""FD5"" treats inanimate objects - malfunctioning air conditioners say - like killers whose mindlessness only makes them more unstoppable. This series courted fans with elaborate chain-reaction sequences in which minor accidents cause mayhem. Writer Eric Heisserer and director Steven Quale fill their quota of those here but they only get part of the formula right. While viewers will get plenty of nervous giggles out of watching as burping water-coolers or (yes) inappropriately-ringing cell phones trigger fatal mishaps the filmmakers dont milk the this-leads-to-that element that made Rube Goldberg famous. Once the initial trigger happens theres not a lot of fun left in the scene. Even by this franchises standards its perverse that a pointy one-centimeter-long screw (standing point-up on a gymnasts balance beam) should provide more tension than anything else here - doubly so because it features in the first death sequence and the thrills taper off pretty consistently from there. To their credit Heisserer and Quale do manage a couple of grisly post-mortem punch lines after viewers think the violence has reached its conclusion. But one or two of the gags are mean-spirited enough to kill the humor. The script and acting satisfy the genres requirements by being thoroughly forgettable. After leaving we will remember only that some of the characters were dating each other one wanted to be a chef one was a pudgy bespectacled guy with an inexplicably active love life and one looked like a low-rent heavy-eyebrowed Tom Cruise. Oh - and David Koechner the braying boor from ""Anchorman"" and ""The Office"" was their boss. Another thing viewers might forget is that the movie was in 3-D a fact that becomes irrelevant soon after the attention-getting opening titles. If a movie this full of surprise impalement and vicious projectiles cant make 3-D fun isnt it time to scrap the whole fad?

This horror series with a touch of black comedy continues under the direction of first-timer Steven Quale. TWITTER Nicholas DAgosto Emma Bell Miles Fisher and Courtney B. Vance star in the fifth installment of the horror series directed by first-timer Steven Quale. Final Destination 5 continues New Lines ""death tease"" series wherein a group of clueless characters are stalked not by a demon or mad man but by death itself ... or to be accurate the films makers. Real death of course is much more prosaic letting far too many people expire in their beds which is very uncinematic. In this film as in the previous four editions the suspense or tease if you will lies in guessing which of the objects in a location will terminate a character -- the faulty wiring that loose wing nut those nasty knives an overhead fan or perhaps a kitchen fire? In a sense the films offer up black comedy provoking laughs at wrong guesses and giggles over an absurd chain of events that results in disaster. The series was on its own deathbed when the producers to their credit got the bright idea in FD4 to make the film in 3D. Sharp objects appeared that much sharper with the added dimension so the series got a reprieve and here everyone is back with a fifth film. To borrow from TV terminology the series hasnt jumped the shark yet but the strain of inventing bizarre deaths is beginning to show. This films opening sequence is undeniably spectacular. What must happen in each film is that one character gets a graphic premonition of impending disaster which he essentially lives through moments before it actually happens. In FD5 a group of young people heading for a company retreat gets trapped in a bus on a high suspension bridge over a river just as the damn thing collapses in a ""freak wind storm."" Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) is the designated savior this time which allows him to rescue seven colleagues including best pal Peter (Miles Fisher) and girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell). These survivors are dubbed the Lucky Eight by the media but from deaths point of view everyone was meant to die on that bridge. As deaths dour emissary (Tony Todd who took the last film off) warns Sam at the funeral ""Death doesnt like to be cheated."" So its game on and the characters immediately start to meet horrible ends which baffles an FBI guy (Courtney B. Vance) weirdly called in to investigate potential criminality in the bridge collapse. The series holds a peculiar fondness for impalement of human flesh but the deaths created here in Eric Heisserers mercifully swift screenplay really push that predilection to include demises involving acupuncture and laser eye surgery. To be sure there are a couple of straightforward impalements too mundane to mention. The twist to this new edition is that deaths emissary lets a few characters in on a dirty little secret If any of the Lucky Eight takes an innocent life this will somehow balance the books in the afterlife Death will no longer stalk that individual. This twist has greater dramatic potential than the filmmakers seem to realize for in doesnt really come into play until a climatic sequence where the filmmakers unwittingly undercut the series M.O. Will a fantastic accident or a good old-fashioned homicide do in the final survivors? The filmmakers never quite make up their minds how to play this. Steven Quale a longtime colleague of James Cameron who has worked in cinematography and visual effects including 3D for over two decades was recruited to make his directing debut. Surprisingly the 3D doesnt amount to much after the bridge collapse. So it will be interesting to see how fans of the series spend their money this time since the 2D option will come with a smaller ticket price. The British Columbia production is slickly designed and takes ample advantage of its locations from an Asian spa to a restaurant kitchen. The cast is a lively bunch but since emotions ran only a narrow gamut from anxiety to terror and back again there isnt much opportunity to show off thespian skills. Ellen Wroe does get to show off her gymnastic training though in the films first and least plausible death. Jacqueline MacInnes Wood all but tears a teddy bear to shreds in the ophthalmologists chair. Arlen Escarpeta should actually survive according to deaths survivors calculus but it turns out death cheats too. P.J. Byrne reaches for comedy in his spa death scene while David Koechner as The Office-style boss punches out so suddenly you might call his a disappointing death. Opens Friday Aug. 12 (Warner Bros.)

"Final Destination 5 | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Final Destination 5 Joe Leydon Film Critic joeleydon 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr August 11 2011 | 0150AM PT This latest entry in the 11-year-old horror series duly adheres to tradition by providing inventively grisly demises for various characters. Constrained by a formula as restrictive as the elements that define haiku or iambic pentameter scripter Eric Heisserer and first-time feature helmer Steven Quale nevertheless generate a respectable amount of suspense in ""Final Destination 5."" This latest entry in the 11-year-old horror series duly adheres to tradition by providing inventively grisly demises for various characters. But theres cheeky cleverness on display in the Rube Goldberg-style setups -- and darkly ironic payoffs -- for most of those death scenes. And while the pics nasty ending would serve as satisfying closure for the franchise theatrical and homevid biz should guarantee even more sequels. Once again the plot pivots on a disparate group of people who miraculously cheat death -- only to find theyve merely delayed their grim reapings. In this case the inevitable is avoided -- temporarily -- thanks to Sam (Nicholas DAgosto) a sales rep for a paper manufacturing firm who has a terrifying vision of horrific disaster while aboard a bus bound for a corporate weekend retreat. Specifically Sam ""sees"" dozens of folks -- including many of his fellow employees -- killed during a bridge collapse. True to his premonition the bridge does indeed go falling down but not before Sam preemptively flees to safety with estranged girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell) corporate climber Peter (Miles Fisher) bespectacled hottie Olivia (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) gymnast/intern Candice (Ellen Wroe) young plant foreman Nathan (Arlen Escarpeta) nerdy skirt-chaser Isaac (P.J. Byrne) and sleazy executive Dennis (David Koechner). Bludworth the spooky-sagacious franchise mainstay once again played by Tony Todd gives fair warning ""Death doesnt like to be cheated."" And sure enough one after another the survivors are felled by fatal accidents that -- as the audience knows full well but characters onscreen only gradually realize -- really arent random events. Quale (second unit director on James Camerons ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"") and Heisserer (who also penned the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" remake and the upcoming prequel to John Carpenters ""The Thing"") stick closely to the game plan established by earlier ""Final Destination"" pics methodically ratcheting up tension before each bloody quietus by slowly laying out the interlocking mishaps and happenstances that inexorably lead to decapitation defenestration or other sorts of carnage. But they repeatedly spring unsettling surprises with crafty fakeouts triggering laughs as well as gasps by upending expectations at the last second. Even more deviously they provide only fleeting hints to viewers that everything they see may not be as it appears -- and more important when it appears. Indeed one can view this latest pic as a shrewdly calculated attempt to reboot the franchise after 2009s misleadingly titled ""The Final Destination"" which despite posting the series highest worldwide gross also was the most critically lambasted. Performances are fine with Fisher amusingly channeling a young Tom Cruise in the pics most interesting character arc and Courtney B. Vance providing the right touch of intelligent skepticism as a federal agent investigating the bridge disaster and its aftermath. Lenser Brian Pearson exploits 3D for a multitude of cheap thrills particularly during the opening credits when skulls shattered glass sharp knives and -- the horror -- fluorescent light bulbs appear to fly off the screen. He also makes use of the gimmickry to add depth of field to key scenes so that for example the chaos on the collapsing bridge is all the more viscerally exciting. Other tech values are pro.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For anyone who doesnt already know how lovingly the Final Destination franchise clings to repeated tropes and gleefully gory shocks the series fifth entry begins with a statement of purpose a lengthy opening-credits sequence featuring random CGI objects (skulls bloody nails flaming windowpanes an exploding microwave a burning corpse and much much more) crashing through CGI glass and flying at viewers eyes in 3-D slow-motion. Its painfully repetitive context-free violence-fetishization and its instantly boring yet dragged out at vast length. Thats all fully appropriate for a series thats been coasting on the same gorehound storyline for more than a decade. Still it does make what follows feel creative by comparison as Final Destination 5 tries to spruce up the once-fresh now-familiar plot with a few new wrinkles. Once again a well-meaning kid has a precognitive vision that lets him save a group of people from horrific death. (By this time the minor variations from film to film feel like something from a game of Clue or a Mad Libs sheet In this case its Nicholas DAgosto rescuing his paper-plant coworkers from a suspension-bridge collapse.) Once again the survivors begin dying in hyperbolically unlikely ways and DAgosto and company realize death feels cheated and is trying to reclaim them. One new twist Candymans Tony Todd reprising his occasional role as a creepy mysteriously knowledgeable figure claims the doomed cast can trade fates and lifespans with other people by murdering them. Another twist In setting up the elaborate gruesomely fatal accidents that are the FD movies raison detre director Steven Quale (Aliens Of The Deep) and screenwriter Eric Heisserer (the 2010 Nightmare On Elm Street reboot) actually insert a few red herrings for a little misleading tension. And it practically counts as a twist that they also tried to personalize some of FD5s characters. Most of them are generic chum-to-be particularly the usual roster of mildly hateable stereotypes meant to attract horror fans bloodlust--including David Koechner slumming it as The Obnoxious Boss. But DAgosto at least with his dreams of being a Parisian chef and his dedication to the girlfriend (Emma Bell) who just dumped him feels like a more realized character than the series has seen in a while. Still while FD5 is less generic and less facilely goofy and ironic than past series installments its still a rote execution of formula that scores its biggest points with self-aware references to its predecessors--including a closing-credits montage of kills from Final Destinations past. Which echoes the opening credits and reiterates the theme Who needs a creative storyline or meaningful connections when you can just string some shocking images together?
