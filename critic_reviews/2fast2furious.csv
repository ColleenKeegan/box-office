This John Singleton-directed sequel provides a breezy enough joyridebut it lacks the unassuming freshness of the economy-priced original. New model looks to deliver lower B.O. mpg. The engines no longer run on Diesel but the cars still blister the asphalt in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" an OK follow-up to the surprise hit of two summers ago. Returning star Paul Walker and singer Tyrese establish some peppery onscreen chemistry that injects good-humored rivalry into the narrative filler between high-speed set pieces. But while this John Singleton-directed sequel provides a breezy enough joyride it lacks the unassuming freshness and appealing neighborhood feel of the economy-priced original which grossed a powerhouse 145 million domestically but only 63 million internationally. New model looks to deliver somewhat lower B.O. mpg. ""The Fast and the Furious"" bucked all expectations by customizing the hot rod exploitationers of the 50s and the vehicular good ol boy pics of the 70s with new automotive and ethnic contours. In addition to benefiting from the muscle and dramatic gravity of emerging star Vin Diesel the characters and working-class milieu also felt unusually genuine for such a commercially-minded genre piece resulting in an unpretentious straight-ahead entertainment that excited young audiences and provided a guilty pleasure for many critics as well. New item provokes slightly more guilt with somewhat less pleasure. This time around with the action shifted from L.A. to Miami street life and illicit racing are still evident at the outset. But as the action increasingly comes to spin around such sights as smooth-as-silk crime lords thuggy bodyguards fancy ladies police chicanery and other staples of the big and small screens a veil of familiarity and connect-the-dots storytelling settles over the proceedings just as the gritty Cormanesque style has been unnecessarily upgraded with an obviously bigger budget. If another sequel were to follow in this vein it would end up closer to ""Miami Vice"" than to the series progenitor. When last seen Walkers Brian OConner had thrown his law enforcement career away for the sake of personal honor. Now a layabout in Miami Brian is paged by street entrepreneur Tej (rapper Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) as a last-minute entrant in a wild nighttime street race that demonstrates new pics intention to try to outdo the original in the speed and stunt departments. Opening action sequence also intros some characters who are thereafter almost entirely sidelined most notably the intriguingly no-nonsense Suki played by offbeat model Devon Aoki. Tapped by the Feds to help them nail elusive Argentine import/export money launderer Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) Brian welcomes the chance at professional rehabilitation but insists upon teaming with childhood pal and fellow speed-freak Roman Pearce (Tyrese) reduced to driving demolition derbies in Barstow while under house arrest. Although he still unjustly blames Brian for landing him in the pen for three years Roman has nothing to lose and a cleared record to gain by going along with the plan which hinges on the two becoming drivers for Verone. Pair is introduced into the baddies circle by sleek Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) a U.S. customs agent whose undercover activities seem to include being Verones girlfriend. Rivalry for Monicas attentions is just one of the many excuses for humorous macho posturing by Roman and low-key one-upsmanship by Brian perhaps best exemplified by a delightful ""stare-and-drive"" sequence in which Brian zooms down the street while giving undivided ocular attention to Monica in the passenger seat. Pic remains on sure footing during the ""audition"" sequence in which several driving teams compete for the Verone job by pulling off a task that involves racing to a distant location. So different in style but united by their lifelong love of car culture above all else Brian and Roman make a good duo as do the actors. Although still a bit bland in the blond Tab Hunter/Troy Donahue tradition Walker has noticeably loosened up since the first outing while simultaneously projecting more authority making him a more engaging presence than before. Tyrese who previously starred for Singleton in ""Baby Boy"" has a look live-wire personality and self-amused undercurrent that the camera loves which bodes well for his screen future. But when the script by first-timers Michael Brandt and Derek Haas moves squarely into Verones world of Eurotrashy nightclubs yachts gratuitous torture venal threats and shoot-outs pic begins trading in too many timeworn crime pic conventions the polish quickly dulling on the franchise veneer. Some narrative twists and complications keep matters lively enough and the film is nothing if not professional but there is a distinct feel toward the end of the creative tank running toward empty. Dolled up and looking like a cross between Cindy Crawford and Raquel Welch Mendes moves among all the macho men with smooth confidence. Driving stunt and tech work is all pushed beyond the red line while hip-hoppy soundtrack emphasizes the bass line. 2 Fast 2 FuriousProductionA Universal release of a Neal H. Moritz production.

Thus 2 Fast 2 Furious is an adequate title for the latest sequel to pick your pocket even though this kind of cutesy moniker cant help but bring to mind the skunk-like aromas put out by Cradle 2 the Grave only four months ago. The new film is of course the follow-up to 2001s The Fast and the Furious. That surprise box office bonanza was one of those rare recent movies that really did recapture the feel -- without the tinny soundtrack -- of nostalgic drive-in fodder from decades past. But this go-round which deals with infiltrating the operation of a Miami-based money launderer (Cole Hauser) has a built-in problem. Ask yourself If only one lead from the first Fast can return for its sequel should it be sleepy Paul Walker or the more dynamic Vin Diesel? Well forget Diesel because a) Walkers cop character let Diesels hotly pursued fugitive escape into presumed anonymity at the end of the original; and b) Diesel has been too busy being top-billed in high art like XXX and A Man Apart. Review of the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious ( out of four) Stars Paul Walker Tyrese Eva Mendes Cole Hauser Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges James Remar Director John Singleton Distributor Universal Rating PG-13 for street racing violence language and some sensuality. Opens Friday nationwide So here we are with Walker whose actions have gotten him bounced off the force though the Feds are willing to forgive if he and an estranged pal (Tyrese from 2 Fast director John Singletons last film Baby Boy) will get Hauser. Before you can say Studebaker were back into a very specific culture where the new agents female counterpart (Eva Mendes) looks as if she ought to be on the cover of a mens magazine. Here guys ask women ""When are you going to pop my clutch?"" and cuties who can handle fast cars as well as men are named Suki. As for male camaraderie these dudes call everyone ""Bro."" The movie is all about racing and character be damned though the still dazed-looking Walker and Tyrese finally get a little rapport going after a worn-out storys very rocky start. Baby Boy was Singletons best since 1991s Boyz N the Hood breakthrough but here hes just trying to slum as painlessly as possible. Like last weeks The Italian Job this movie is all about using public thoroughfares as personal speedways with slow-on-the-take police and no helicopter-TV coverage (yeah right). At least 2 Fast is self-aware enough to know that its trash which is worth half a bonus point. Lack of pretension helps the viewer get over the fact that this is just another retread.

Starring Paul Walker Tyrese cq1word Eva Mendes and Cole Hauser. Directed by John Singleton. Co-written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas. (PG-13 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In 2001 ""The Fast and the Furious"" was testimony to the unexpected lure of a howling engine blue smoke from spinning tires and hot dudes and babes in even hotter cars . Oh yeah and the moody glower of breakout star Vin Diesel. So what do you do for the sequel? More smoke babes dudes and howling. And no Diesel. The result? Well as expected director John Singleton (""Boyz N the Hood"") did not make a movie as good as ""FF1."" This is way better. How is it better? Let us count the ways. First he got rid of all the extraneous stuff -- like plot. ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" has something to do with money and drugs but Singleton wisely doesnt spend too much time sweating the details. Basically it boils down to one of two situations The guys have something and must drive 120 mph to escape with it or they are after something and must drive 120 mph to capture it. Second the lumpish presence of Diesel and his biceps is barely missed at all. Like the first version this film seems to be set up as a star vehicle for blue-eyed Steve McQueenesque Paul Walker. But once again it looks as if the sidekick walks off with the movie. An actor rapper and model Tyrese (as Walkers pal Roman Pearce) brings something new to Diesels role as the moody hard-driving loner -- a personality. Hes not just buffed and cocky hes got such a nice way with a one-liner that he grows on you. Like virtually everyone else in the sequel Tyrese was not part of the original. This is exactly the same movie as the first one except for the fact that almost all the actors have changed it is now set in Miami instead of Southern California and a Cuban drug dealer (Cole Hauser of ""White Oleander"") has been added as a villain. The constant is that these are still the sort of hot-wheelers who -- when a 20-foot jump is unexpectedly inserted at the end of a white-knuckle race -- find it to be an exhilarating and amusing development. They sail hundreds of feet through the air hollering ""Whoooooooo"" at the top of their lungs and have a good laugh about it at the finish line. (No one gets hurt of course despite the lack of helmets seat belts or parachutes.) The new premise is that Walkers character Brian OConner has been kicked off the police force and is scratching out a borderline existence in Florida as a street racer. His buddy Tej (rapper Ludacris an improvement over Ja- Rule in ""FF1"") runs the garage finds him races and helps him live the car culture life. Call it ""Boyz Under the Hood."" OConner needs money and is offered a chance to make some -- and of course clear his name -- on an undercover job with U.S. Customs. In an amazing coincidence the undercover agent he is working with happens to be a gorgeous brunette (Eva Mendes of ""Training Day""). He also picks up his pal Roman (Tyrese) to help run the scam. And were off. RIVETING DRAG RACES One nice touch is that in Miami they are apparently not into that boring side-by-side drag racing from ""FF1."" This is real street racing with NASCAR- style fender-rubbing and bumper-bumping. There are at least three set pieces in which cars careen through traffic cutting off semitrailers skidding across lanes and creating spectacular crashes. It is riveting -- except for those who have driven there who will recognize it as just another typical day on a Miami freeway. However it should be said that Singleton does a nice job of keeping the gratuitous violence to a minimum. Nothing says summer film fun like explosions guns and cartwheeling cars -- and thats all here -- but the gore and mayhem is restrained. The scene youll be talking about afterward involving a rat a bucket and a blowtorch is especially clever since its effect depends almost entirely on the viewers imagination not grisly details. The rest of the action is more likely to spark interest in high-performance racing gear than gunplay. HIGH-SPEED FANTASY There will probably be a rash of concerned citizens who decry the crazy driving showcased in the film. But the FF movies may be saving the clutch-and- shift car from extinction. (Although someone should point out that there is not a street racer in the world that has a gear that can be engaged at 114 mph to make the car go faster.) At the end the whole thing makes no more sense than the conclusion an implausible pointless high-speed leap over hundreds of feet of water. But that doesnt mean you wont be hollering ""Whoooooooo"" all the way.

"2 Fast 2 Furious | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 2-fast-2-furious ) 2 Fast 2 Furious (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres good news and bad news about 2 Fast 2 Furious the moronic follow-up to The Fast and the Furious and a contender for the worst movie of 2003. The good news is that its better albeit marginally than Freddy Got Fingered. The bad news is that its 15 minutes longer. I understand the reasons underlying the existence of this pathetic excuse for a motion picture. The Fast and the Furious was unexpectedly successful and these days whenever a movie speeds into the realm of being profitable a sequel must follow as surely as thunder follows lightning (and sometimes almost as quickly). The question I have is how and why anyone would approve this particular sequel. The mind-numbing stupidity of Hollywood decision-makers never ceases to amaze me. Tastelessness and mediocrity may be recipes for multiplex success but I cant believe that even a car-obsessed teenage boy would enjoy this atrocity. The only reason any non-lobotomized movie-goer will see 2 Fast 2 Furious is because of its association with its well received predecessor. On its own merit this movie should have bypassed theaters video stores and cable on its straight-to-the-garbage dump spinout. In terms of casting almost every imaginable error was made. Instead of Vin Diesel we have model-turned-actor Tyrese whose performance gives model-turned-actors a bad name. (Diesel reportedly backed out of 2 Fast 2 Furious because its production schedule conflicted with that of XXX. More likely he read this script and realized that appearing in the movie would be tantamount to committing professional suicide.) Instead of Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster were stuck with Eva Mendes whose expression makes her look like shes constantly trying to twist a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue. And instead of jettisoning Paul Walker for someone with a scintilla of acting ability the filmmakers have force-fed us Paul Walker. The guy sounds like Keanu Reeves but next to him the Stiff One has the range and panache of Sir Anthony Hopkins. So cut to the chase you saya| And thats precisely the problem. 2 Fast 2 Furious is basically one unending chase with occasional pauses for bad dialogue tissue paper thin character development and an occasional shot of a woman in a bikini. (As expected with a PG-13 movie the Tamp;A quotient is so low that its hardly worth mentioning.) The car chases in The Fast and the Furious were well fast and furious. They had style. They got the adrenaline pumping. In contrast the ones here are boooooooooring. The Indianapolis 500 a with cars going around and around in circles a has more action excitement and suspense (and you dont know from the beginning whos going to win). Director John Singleton must have studied how to drain all the energy from a chase/race before embarking upon this project. Plus he tries to spice things up by showing us lots of close-ups of feet hands and eyes (rather than following the actual races) but all that does is get us wondering about the fleck of loose makeup on Walkers left lid. I believe there is supposed to be a plot. I say ""believe"" because every once in a while theres a break in the so-called action so a character can speak a few lines of expository dialogue. I spent most of the movie utterly confused primarily because I was trying to use my brain to figure out what was transpiring. I believe it is necessary to become catatonic in order to cut through the guano that director John Singleton and screenwriters Michael Brandt amp; Derek Haas have piled on. This is about the best summary I can generate. Brian OConnor (Walker) is back. Hes not a cop any more but that doesnt stop a bunch of Feds from getting him to work undercover. So in order not to be alone (the filmmakers in a rare moment of lucidity apparently realized that there was no way Walker would be able to carry the film on his own) he recruits an old buddy Roman Pearce (Tyrese) who has a score to settle with Brian. The two of them infiltrate the evil empire of drug czar Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) by becoming his drivers. Already in place is an undercover cop Monica Clemente (Eva Mendes) who is playing the part of Verones mistress. Beyond that things start getting murky. The ultimate point I suppose is for Brian and Roman to stay alive and deliver Verone to the cops. If they do this their criminal records will be expunged and they will be free men. The question ""Who cares?"" is a valid one but a more pointed query might be ""Who would spend money to see this movie?"" The answer is ""Anyone who doesnt pay attention to word of mouth."" Admittedly one never expects a film a even a sequel to a less-than-stellar first picture a to be this awful. One might have suspected that 2 Fast 2 Furious would be tepid and vapid but not rancid. Anticipating quality from a summer blockbuster may be asking for too much but is it driving too hard a bargain to hope for entertainment? Judging by 2 Fast 2 Furious the answer is yes. This movie only takes a few minutes to crash and burn but more than an hour and a half to realize it. 2 Fast 2 Furious (United States 2003) Director John Singleton Cast Paul Walker Tyrese Eva Mendes Cole Hauser Chris Ludacris Bridges Thom Barry James Remar Devon Aoki Screenplay Michael Brandt amp; Derek Haas Cinematography Matthew F.

"CNN.com - Review 2 Fast pure high-test formula - Jun. 6 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Overview | Gallery | Quiz Review 2 Fast pure high-test formula The movie isnt much but how bout those cars? By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson star in ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- ""The Fast and The Furious"" made 144 million in domestic box office so a sequel to the 2001 hit was practically mandated by law. The follow-up ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is just exactly what youd expect. Yes its fast and yes its furious. However there is one big difference. Vin Deisel who became instantly famous after ""The Fast and The Furious"" declined to reprise his star-making role. Which leaves the movie in the hands of his co-star Paul Walker who has yet to become a household name. Not that it really matters the cars are the stars of the show. There is a bit of a story. As in the first film Walker plays cop Brian OConner. As ""2 Fast"" opens OConner has been kicked out of the Los Angeles Police Department for letting a big-rig hijacker escape and is now living in Miami. But he has not left his love of speed and hot cars behind. When hes picked up by the Miami cops for illegal street racing hes given the choice of jail time or once again going undercover. Of course he takes the undercover gig -- otherwise this would be a very short movie -- but insists on picking his own partner. His choice is his boyhood buddy ex-con Roman Pearce played by singer-model -- and now -actor -- Tyrese Gibson. The pair is sent to work for a flashy executive Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) who is actually in the business of laundering money. Their contact on the inside is the beautiful Eva Mendes another undercover cop posing as Verones girlfriend. Plot? Theres a plot? Paul Walker makes contact with an undercover cop played by Eva Mendes in ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" The plot such as it is is hard to swallow but with this type of film the plot is not the point. Besides youll be offered plenty of high-octane fuel during the film to wash it all down. So what is the point? Scene after scene of incredible car chases and lots of incredibly beautiful women wearing incredibly tight and revealing clothing -- thats the point. Director John Singleton (1991s ""Boyz N The Hood"" and 2000s ""Shaft"") knows just when and where to push the buttons of his target audience. Leaving nothing to chance the producers also commissioned a survey by Teen Research Unlimited which specializes exclusively in teenagers. The results of the study showed teens in the fall of 2002 and the spring of 2003 named ""The Fast and The Furious"" as their all-time favorite movie. (Make your own joke here.) Therefore its no surprise that ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" puts the pedal to the metal and grinds out more action per second than most films do in two hours. And that action is spectacular. The car chases are actually real using specialized rigs filming techniques and cameras. No computer-generated images were used and at speeds routinely exceeding 100 miles per hour thats truly remarkable. Everything else a low priority The point of the movie cars. Lots and lots of cars racing up and down major boulevards. The script apparently was not a priority nor was the wardrobe -- such as it is -- for the movies actresses. Most of the films budget went into the cars. Hundreds of super-charged vehicles were needed and some of them are state of the art. The Nissan Skyline R-34 is not even available in the United States yet (although Walker owns one in real life) and the Mitsubishi Evolution 7 just came out this year. Walker and Gibson seem to be having a great time together even though its impossible to believe the plots assertion that these two grew up in the same neighborhood. And despite trite dialogue -- Walker trying out a new car ""Lets see what this thing can do"" -- this movie will satisfy most fans of the original film. Its pure formula from start to finish but that was obviously the goal from start to finish. Teenagers start your engines summer has arrived.

"2 Fast Talks Loud Says Very Little washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids 2 Fast Talks Loud Says Very Little Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 6 2003 ""AMERICAN muscle"" says Roman Pearce (Tyrese) flexing his tattooed triceps at the wheel of his speeding nitrous oxide power-packed roadster. Hes boasting about the car his driving and the culture that produced all of this. And if that doesnt make you want to leap out of your seat and high-five your neighbor well you might not be right or ready for ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" Director John Singletons energetic if empty sequel to the commercially successful ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a loud gear-crunching engine-screaming salute to traditionally male attributes strength speed attitude and appreciation of female and vehicular sleekness A? although not necessarily in that order. It is about semi-naked women stroking the smooth polished bodies of muscle cars their backs arched before the low-angled camera lens. And it tries to be about male friendship too the one between Brian OConnor (Paul Walker) and Roman who are thrown together by the usual flimsy circumstances of most action films. This friendship amounts to a sequels tacit apology for the notable absence of Vin Diesel who was in the first film. In that movie undercover cop Brian became so attached to his charismatic mark Dominic (Diesel) he let him escape. Brian has been subsequently fired but as ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" begins the Miami cops corral him into infiltrating the world of illegal car racing again this time to bust a drug dealer. Brian recruits Roman as a partner. But Roman a racing hustling former pal blames the ex-cop for not saving him from three years in the pen. Although Tyrese is an engaging performer and his characters resentment fuels some amusing bantering this cliched central partnership (I should have counted how many times the bland Walker says the word ""bro"") simply draws attention to Diesels absence. Who knew you could actually miss Vin Diesel? ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is not about good storytelling but it knows to turn up the volume cut to dizzying closeups of drivers eyes as they negotiate dangerous bends and indulge its audience in the soul slaps fanny grabs and head nods that govern this racing lifestyle A? or apparently do. And even though this plot has all the depth and resonance of an old ""Miami Vice"" television show Singleton is primarily concerned with the feeling the emotional torque of it all. American muscle has a whole sideshow and for the audiences most likely to see this film that seems to be the bottom line. 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS (PG-13 108 minutes) A?

"2 Fast 2 Furious is way too lame. Slate Sign In Sign Up 2 Fast 2 Furious is way too lame. 2 Fast 2 Furious is way too lame. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 5 2003 609 PM Drive Dammit Drive 2 Fast2 Furious is too chaste and too lame. By Michael Agger Tyrese in 2 Fast 2 Furious Velocity should be visceral but here its superficial So far its been a scholarly summer. X2 unfolded like an encyclopedia of geek powers and The Matrix Reloaded lectured us on free will but with the arrival of 2 Fast 2 Furious (Universal) its safe to say that the party has started. The booming bass line begins before the opening credits--actually there are no opening credits as this movie doesnt presume to tax our reading abilities--and the cars are revving and racing through the streets before anyone has a chance to say Wheres Vin Diesel? Advertisement Mr. Diesel emerged as the star of the original film The Fast and the Furious which became a sleeper hit in the summer of 2001. He declined to return for a second spin at the wheel and believe it or not I took this as a bad sign. His leader-of-the-pack charisma is what held together the first movie which despite its blunt edges deserves credit for presenting a few bona fide elements of Los Angeles street-racing culture. (For example the drivers monitor police scanners and wait for a diversionary crime before they race.) This time around the action has been moved to Miami stripped of any semblance of authenticity and turned into another exercise in cool. The new star of the show is Paul Walker a returning cast member whose main attribute seems to be his resemblance to a J.Crew model complete with weathered blond hair. Hes been paired with an actual model Tyrese who takes over the shirt-taking-off duties abdicated by Diesel. And in the grand tradition of politically correct summer ""event"" movies the two actors (one plays an ex-cop the other an ex-con) are accessorized with an Asian driver a Latino driver and so on as well as the requisite rapper Ludacris. The M.C. of this party is John Singleton the noted director of Boyz N the Hood (1991) but more recently the man who botched the remake of the blaxploitation classic Shaft (2000). This time around hes not taking any chances. In what may be charitably called an homage Singleton begins this movie in the exact same way as the first with a four-car illegal street race frequently matching it shot for shot. This beginning of course is what we all came to the theatre for a healthy dose of artery-clearing car racing with a few curvaceous actors on the side. But the movie doesnt deliver on either promise. All that we require of the cast is that they move us from car chase to car chase without unnecessary embarrassment. Instead there is shameless product placement (""This the best garage around. They have Snap-On tools"") sub-Maxim double entendres (""When you gonna pop my clutch?"") and extras who just keep touching their hair like theyre in a shampoo advertisement. At one point the villain (Cole Hauser) says ""Women are a very powerful force."" But the jokes on him 2 Fast is about as sexless as a Saturday morning cartoon. GQ covergirl Eva Mendes is the films designated hottie but shes not asked to do anything remotely tempting. As in a lot of testosterone-soaked movies the men seem more interested in staring at each other. And stare they do. By the evidence of the determined grimaces on their faces the actors drive their cars furiously but thats all we get stern looks and sweaty palms. Theres never a clear uncut driving sequence that doesnt feel like it was filmed on a set or trumped up with digital effects. Its not as if Singleton and his crew needed to reinvent the wheel--a Dukes of Hazzard skid out and a no-cheating ramp-to-ramp jump would have been enough. The first movie had an innovative maneuver where a Honda Civic changed lanes by going underneath a tractor trailer. In the sequel the best they can do is show Paul Walker hitting the Nitrous Oxide button on his steering wheel--a trick street-racers use to give their cars an extra speed boost--after which the passing landscape gets really really blurry. Forget real cars chasing other real cars; its the old digital-effect cop out. John Candy pulled off better stunts in Speed Zone (1989). The clunkiness of 2 Fast 2 Furious would have easily been forgiven if Singleton presented the chase scenes with a modicum of realism. Most of us drive cars and we have a basic sense of their physics. We know the prickly feeling of a close shave or a truck that looms too close. Weve also gaped at the ingenious stunt work of drivers in The Road Warrior (1981) and Ronin (1998). In those films velocity wasnt abstract it was visceral; the chases were stories in miniature with dueling vehicles manipulated by talented visual storytellers. Singleton would rather have us admire how good Tyrese looks behind the wheel of his Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder while humming along at warp speed. 2 Fast 2 Furious is just 2 lame 2 tame and 2 much like a video game.

"2 Fast 2 Furious Slow-Learners Permit washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies 2 Fast 2 Furious Slow-Learners Permit Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 6 2003 ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is 2 loud and 2 long. It makes any1 over the age of 30 go AGHHHHHHHH But any1 over the age of 30 who goes 2 it is 2 dumb 2 worry about. Still I dont quite think it represents the end of Western Civilization as we know it unless you believe the world will end in neither fire nor ice but the growl of acceleration. In fact it even has a faint tinge of nostalgia to it. For us grandpops it recalls the good old days you know way back eons ago ages ago way way back in the . . . 80s. In other words its a kind of ""Miami Vice"" with many more carz and numberz where all the adjectives used 2 go. (Last ""2"" joke folks.) Of course its intended audience has just rolled its eyes collectively signifying ""Whats the geezer saying?"" They dont remember the 80s. They were in nursery school in the 80s. So in an effort to be ""relevant"" to them I would say kids arent there a lot of cheapo car and babes-in-bikini shows on those horrible channels you watch like the WB and Fox? ""Fastlane"" that sort of thing. Well kids This is sort of like that. The Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs roles are played by young men named Paul something and Tyrese nothing. Like Liberaces Tyreses last name (which is Gibson when he starred in John Singletons ""Baby Boy"") fell off somewhere on the climb to stardom. And like Liberace Tyrese is in love with a beautiful young man. The difference is that the young man Liberace loved was someone else while the young man Tyrese loves is named Tyrese. The plot is pure ""Vice"" drippings. A defrocked undercover officer named Brian OConner (Paul Walker thats it who starred in the original ""The Fast and the Furious"" along with Vin Diesel who has gone on to bigger things) is asked to penetrate the mob of a suspected drug lord. He himself is locally famous as an outlaw street racer who never loses. The deal is that the drug lord is looking for drivers; hes going to move a mysterious shipment and he needs someone who can take a Lotus through downtown Miami traffic at 140 mph leaving cops in his turbulent wake. (Unlike in say last weeks car movie ""The Italian Job"" there are cops in this world; theyre just mostly stupid and slow.) OConner insists that he be partnered with his boyhood chum Roman Pearce (Tyrese) whose driving skill he admires. So you have a salt-and-pepper team infiltrating the luxurious tropical domain of a sleek beautiful bad guy (Cole Hauser) and another voluptuous undercover agent (Eva Mendes) who is already in place. How ""Vice"" is that? Its quite primitive and the director Singleton (besides the tough-minded ""Baby Boy"" he did the brilliant ""Boyz in the Hood"") keeps it moving along quickly enough. Instead of the gunfights ""Vice"" featured the chosen form of competition is vehicular which leads to endless scenes of car chases. You could say the movie cuts to the chase except that theres nothing for it to cut from to that chase; its pretty much all chase. Do you like to watch cars pile up spin out leap tall buildings at a single bound all while laying down a soundtrack that sounds like the planet Jupiter crashing into the planet Earth? Then this movie is for you and nothing I can say matters much. It does offer one significant moment that might be said to identify exactly the boundary between the Old Movie and the New Movie. It climaxes with a tremendous stunt A vehicle careers down a dirt road at about 160 hits a ramp flies through the air like a rocket ship and intercepts exactly another moving transportation format. Give the stunt driver a bonus. In an Old Movie however the following scene would have taken place There would have been an establishing shot making the point that for whatever reason and no matter how lame the logic behind it a ramp rested at the end of the road. Oh I dont know Maybe the two heroes would have gotten lost and noticed the ramp or an aerial photograph the cops had would have disclosed the presence of the ramp. In the old orderly Hollywood story mind no matter how or why That ramp would have been established. New Movie To hell with the establishing shot. It doesnt matter. The two boys just punch the pedal to the metal the car takes off like a jack rabbit with its tail ablaze dust rises and swirls the soundtrack goes nuclear and what the hell theres a ramp there exactly where it should be and off the car goes unfettered by any concerns with even the flimsiest connection with possibility. Like it or not thats the way it is. 2 Fast 2 Furious (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for mild violence though it does include one extremely discomforting scene of implied torture.

Well vrooom baby In 2 Fast 2 Furious really speedy cars already have. Oh there are nondigital handsome and buff young men and women involved in the story - a sequel to the zippy-trash 2001 box office phenomenon ""The Fast and the Furious"" that moves the nighttime world of outlaw street racing from L.A. to Miami (where the climate is equally friendly to bare flesh whew). Theres the tattooed well-muscled gleaming-toothed model-singer Tyrese playing a quick-witted ex-con whos even quicker behind the wheel slithery Eva Mendes as an undercover agent cozying up to Cole Hausers brutal cigar-clipping money launderer and a few other crudely sketched plot placeholders with equally flashy chassis. But cardboard cutouts of mannequins wheeled across the set on casters would have served just as well Between that first guilty-pleasure-size hit (which made Vin Diesel a certain kind of turbo-headed star) and this 2 Potentially Lucrative 2 Refuse second rally all pretense of interest in the human beings strapped into the drivers seats has been dumped like a stolen Yugo. Even more than director Rob Cohens original (which paused goofily every now and then for tortured soliloquies on the thrill of the race) ""2F2F"" under the cut-to-the-chase direction of John Singleton strips the package known as the Mindless Summer Movie down to its barest components of wheels skin and a pulsing soundtrack. Every girl is a hottie with buns of steel and every guy regardless of race is a homey who tacks a ""bro"" onto the end of each declarative sentence. But the cars - sorry weekend warriors and hobbyists youre on your own here with the oohing and ahhing over technical specs; I just know theyre painted the bright colors of jelly beans - are the only stars. And when the drivers change gears in their pursuit of even...more...speed each close-up shot of fearless hand gripping phallic stickshift and clump-kicking boot pumping clutch pedal is accompanied by a happy grinding you-are-there rasp of sound effect. An aficionado of this kind of experience doesnt pay attention to the story so much as let the glittering and throbbing sequences of light and sound do their narcotic job. Thats what fast and furious audiences want isnt it? Thats what I want at any rate if the alternative is a movie that pretends Im supposed to care about the latest adventures of cutie cop Brian OConner. Because as fans of the original (and I was one) will remember OConner played by Paul Walker was the least interesting entrant in the race And here the dull grinning pinup policeman is the only character back for more. (Its not Diesel I miss its Michelle Rodriguez; I was hoping to hear the ""Girlfight"" star growl the word ""skank"" again and model-actress Devon Aokis vogue-ing poses as a chick racer are no substitute.) Off the force with Florida light playing nicely and ""Miami Vice""-ly on his blue eyes and gold-streaked hair OConner gets dragged into an undercover operation to frame Hausers kingpin that requires much fancy driving for which he recruits an old speed-demon friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese) as a partner. Like its predecessor ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" has a good-natured and realistic sense of its own junky weightlessness; unlike so many other self-important sequels to casual sleeper hits the story by Gary Scott Thompson (who wrote ""The Fast and the Furious"") and the script by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas dont try to penetrate street-racer psychology sticking to surface observations about as deep as a coat of spray enamel. If anything the components of Singletons production are each a little sleeker better packaged and dumber than those of Cohens more innovative lower-rent one. And for all the flash of Miami flesh (much cleavage but no nudity) and for all the macho talk among the dudes sex - and sexiness - is tucked away even more prudishly than it was when Diesels roamed the earth. The bad guys are jokes (although one baroquely sadistic torture scene uncomfortably suggests otherwise). The good guys dont take their work seriously. Cheerfully devoid of fury and stupidly satisfied with their closed-track lives the crazy half-naked gear-stripping kids at this summertime hot-rod jamboree are as wholesome as the demolition-derby drivers at a county fair.
