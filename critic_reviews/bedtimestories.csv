This years chump is Adam Sandler essaying his usual bipolar man-child schtick as Skeeter Bronson the handyman at a grand hotel built on the site of the Mom n Pop motel where he grew up who is nonplussed when the tales he concocts for his niece and nephew begin to have eerie parallels in real life.Bedtime Stories starts well with Sandlers naturally acerbic persona and wilfully erratic turns from Guy Pearce and Russell Brand  serving to offset the scripts more schmaltzy moments. But it descends into pathos undermined by an insipid romantic subplot and the usual platitudinous guff about self-belief. Insult is added to injury by a series of reactionary misinformed anti-eco gags and a distressing but inevitable cameo from Rob Schneider as a Native American.

Release DateNovember 16 2007 http//www.nocountryforoldmen-themovie.com Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - By Scott Foundas The most measured classical film of Joel and Ethan Coens career and maybe the best No Country for Old Men carries echoes of earlier Coen brothers films -- in the Texas setting (Blood Simple) and the idea of simple small-town folk caught up in criminal business (Fargo). But unlike the loquacious eccentrics at the center of most of the Coens movies the characters here are stoic solitary figures who make their homes in desolate landscapes. One of those men is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) a tall saucer-eyed assassin who seems to lower the temperature in the theater whenever he appears onscreen. Another is out-of-work Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbles upon 2 million of Chigurhs bloodstained drug money and decides to keep it for himself. A third is Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) a onetime believer in the forces of law and order made weary by age and time. The mechanics of No Country for Old Men recall those of a vintage film noir and its as gripping and mordantly funny a treatise on the corrosive power of greed as The Killing and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. But in adapting Cormac McCarthys novel the Coens are markedly less interested in who (if anyone) gets away with the loot than in the primal forces that urge the characters forward. There are no heroes or villains here only hunters and hunted members of some endangered species trying to forestall their extinction.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Movie critics secretly believe what so many Hollywood films teach that even the most ordinary schlubbs can rise to excellence. So this reviewer was happy to salute the recent films of two Hollywood types who previously to put it politely hadnt made masterpieces. This summer Adam Sandler dispensed with his standard idiot character and his movies gay-baiting infantilism to play a borderline adult in the rambunctious satisfying You Dont Mess With the Zohan. Director Adam Shankman who had slummed in Disney comedies about exasperated adults and the sassy kids in their care (The Pacifier Cheaper by the Dozen 2) brought movie zazz to a pair of composer Marc Shaimans tuneful parodies Hairspray and this months vidcast Prop 8 The Musical. Lets hear it for the prodigal sons Those pleasant achievements or happy accidents kindled hope for Bedtime Stories the seasons only live-action comedy with a kid-approved PG rating. Well as Emily Dickinson wrote ""Hope is the thing with feathers."" After sitting through this fractious fairy tale we feel as plucked as a Christmas goose. The star and his director have surrendered to their old bad habits in a movie that will nonetheless provide -- as Sandlers character does -- a balky babysitter for children in search of a new-style fairy tale. Sandler plays Skeeter Bronson son of a one-time hotel magnate (Jonathan Pryce) who lost his empire to Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths slimmed down a few stone since his History Boys stint). Now Nottingham is grooming the snidely Kendall (Guy Pearce) as his heir while employing Skeeter in the lowly capacity of light-bulb changer. At the hotel his ally is do-nothing Mickey (Russell Brand); his other adversary is the officious Aspen (Lucy Lawless of Xena renown); and the potential prize and troublemaker is Nottinghams sexy daughter Violet (Teresa Palmer). When Skeeters sister (Courteney Cox) goes out of town she entrusts him with her two children (Jonathan Morgan Heit and Laura Ann Kesling). Actually she doesnt trust him so she has her schoolteacher neighbor Jill (Keri Russell) keep a skeptical eye on him. Was that paragraph as much a chore to read as it was to write? Any comedy with 11 major actors -- not including Sandlers wife Jackie and daughter Sadie the inevitable turn by Rob Schneider (another Sandler familiar John Turturro sat this one out) and a goggle-eyed guinea pig named Bugsy -- is either (a) brilliantly dense in the Preston Sturges tradition or (b) just an overcongested mess. Go with (b). And we havent got to the main contrivance of the plot hatched by Matt Lopez and fleshed out by longtime Sandler scribe Tim Herlihy. Obliged to read the children to sleep with a bedtime story Skeeter tosses aside his sisters PC books like The Organic Squirrel Gets a Bike Helmet (""Communist stuff"" he opines) and invents a fairy tale of his own a medieval frolic where he is Sir Fix-a-Lot and Kendall is Sir Butt-kiss. As Skeeter wanly improvs the kids add impish twists of their own that the sky will rain gumballs a dwarf will ruin Sir Fix-a-Lots heroic moment by kicking him... basic kid stuff. Weird thing is the things the kids made up happen to Skeeter in real life gumballs dwarf and all. If he can somehow harness this magic he may win a competition with Kendall to create a theme for Nottinghams new hotel and save Jills school from demolition. Its all wildly needlessly complicated. The bedtime stories themselves (others are in the Western Roman-epic and Star Wars genres) display some glimmers of comic imagination. But if Shankman was aiming for The Princess Brides mix of fantasy facetiousness and romance or even the meta-fable sprawl of Stardust he missed it by a mile. Magic eludes the entire enterprise. Sure theres potential in the kids-as-sorcerers plot and game energy in the pan-Anglo cast. (Palmer from Australia is a standout as the Paris Hiltonish vixen much more charming than the original.) And yet the movie doesnt move because it is defined by Sandlers essentially static grudging persona. The star is unlikely to change his style. Why should he since in the past decade hes headlined nine movies that have grossed more than 100 million at the domestic box office? Zohan showed he could play a smarter livelier more active character and still connect with the mass audience. But in Bedtime Stories hes back to the old tightly-wound Adam. In one of his exchanges with creepy Kendall Skeeter says ""And me Im like the stink on your feet. I aint ever goin anywhere."" That line could be a threat or a confession of his loser status; but coming from Sandler it sounds like a boast. As long as the paying customers cheer his characters sullen oafish status quo he aint ever goin anywhere.

Starring Adam Sandler Kerri Russell Guy Pearce Courtney Cox Russell Brand Lucy Lawless Teresa Palmer Director Adam Shankman Running time 139  Editorial Review An innocuous but haphazard family comedy that seems less crafted for children than dreamed up by a team of them ""Bedtime Stories"" is energetic enough to occupy youngsters yet slipshod enough that their parents will wish that a few more adults had been around during filming. Instead there is Adam Sandler who brings his immature charms to the role of Skeeter Bronson a handyman with dreams of running the posh L.A. hotel where he changes the light bulbs.Saddled with his niece and nephew for a week Skeeter loosens them up with a mix of social ineptitude funny voices and a lack of regard for others that borders on the sociopathic.Faced at bedtime with the unwelcome concept of reading the kids ew books Skeeter instead makes up his own bedtime story a tale of a medieval handyman whos allowed to compete for a chance to run the kingdom. The kingdom cheers wildly for ""Sir Fixalot"" and gumballs rain from the sky. The next day Skeeter is shocked to learn that his hotels owner (Richard Griffiths) is allowing him to compete for a chance to run the joint. Later gumballs rain from the sky.Instantly of course Skeeter is back with the kids eagerly telling a bedtime story that rewards him with a Ferrari. When the rules of Skeeters magical stories keep nonsensically changing and when the screenwriters Matt Lopez and Tim Herlihy never bother to offer the most perfunctory of explanations for its magic ""Bedtime Stories"" starts to feel awfully lazy.The movies genial tolerability is thanks mostly to Disneys willingness to spend scads of money on its family hits. Director Adam Shankman coordinates a first-rate effects team and the films visuals seem to have been imported straight from a kids imagination onto the screen.Best of all is Keri Russell who plays Adam Sandlers love interest and who brightens the tart rhubarb pie of her performance in ""Waitress"" with just a pinch of Disney sweetness.While theres a moral in ""Bedtime Stories"" about the power of storytelling to forge a bond between adult and child its trapped pretty deep under layers of Sandler-worship and computer-generated booger monsters.-- Dan Kois (Dec. 25 2008)Contains mild rude humor and mild language.

"Bedtime Stories | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bedtime-stories ) Bedtime Stories (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli For Adam Sandler who has lived most of his on-screen life in the realm of PG-13 Bedtime Stories represents a new direction family friendliness. With his characteristic sarcasm dialed down and his profanity and sexual humor nearly absent Sandler half-stumbles his way through this unfamiliar terrain. In the end however its less the lead actor than the writers and director Adam Shankman who make Bedtime Stories forgettable. The premise - that of childrens fables coming true - provides the kind of rich tapestry into which a great family film could be woven. Unfortunately the makers of Bedtime Stories are interested only in cheap humor surface sentimentality and quick payoffs. This is a rare time when young ones will get more out of a Sandler movie than their parents who may have grown up with him when he was on Saturday Night Live. Sandler plays Skeeter Bronson a hotel handyman who agrees to babysit for his niece Bobbi (Laura Ann Kessling) and nephew Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit) while his sister Wendy (Courteney Cox) is out of town job-hunting. He will share the task with Wendys friend Jill (Keri Russell). Jill gets the kids during the day while Skeeter watches them at night. Because they have no television the only way to entertain them is to tell them bedtime stories. Much to Skeeters surprise the adventures he weaves at night come to pass (after a fashion at least) in his life the next day. When he recognizes the connection he begins to tailor the stories to benefit him in various ways getting a chance to compete with his arch-nemesis Kendall (Guy Pearce) to run a new hotel rescuing the damsel-in-distress daughter (Teresa Palmer) of his boss (Richard Griffiths) from roving hoards of paparazzi and having a romantic moment interrupted by Abe Lincoln. Bedtime Stories offers four tales within the movie - a medieval adventure a Western an action/romance and a space opera - none of which does more than provide a template for events that unfold in Skeeters life. Any slight entertainment gleaned from this aspect of the production which is less clever than it could be is ruined by the sappy ending which leaves no clichA(c) from this kind of film unturned. For a creative premise its downright dispiriting to see such a banal interpretation. Bedtime Stories could have been magical but even at its best its barely passable. For the most part Sandler is restrained (no scraps with Bob Barker) leaving the over-the-top moments to Russell Brand who isnt nearly as funny here as he was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Brand whose reputation has become sullied in the U.K. as a result of a tasteless radio prank showed greater comedic aptitude in the earlier movie; all he does here is scream loudly at inappropriate times. The screenplay dangles two potential love interests in front of Sandler Kerri Russells girl-next-door persona and the Paris Hilton-esque character played by Teresa Palmer. Theres never any question with whom Sandler will lock lips but theres more zing between Palmer and Sandler than there is between the fated-from-the-beginning Russell and him. Perhaps the most annoying thing about Bedtime Stories isnt the cheesiness of the special effects (theres almost a charm to them) or the flatness of the fables but the presence of an annoying CGI guinea pig with bulging Marty Feldman eyes. Its as if no Disney movie made these days can go forward without a cute animal on board. In this case the animals antics arent childish; theyre infantile. And the huge eyes rather than being amusing or endearing are kind of creepy. On some level I suppose Bedtime Stories is attempting to say something about the importance of imagination in real life endeavors but if that was the goal the filmmakers might have been advised to take a cue from The Princess Bride. In that movie a grandfather tells a bedtime story to his grandson and what results is a modern fantasy/comedy classic. But despite paying lip service to the sort of thing The Princess Bride achieved Bedtime Stories isnt interested in being creative; it wants to be familiar. It wants to be a PG Disney-fied Adam Sandler feature and thats what results. Perhaps there are potential viewers who possess a perverse curiosity to find out what kind of unholy offspring could result from a Sandler/Disney collaboration (under the aegis of a director whose previous credits include Cheaper By the Dozen 2 which may have been used as a partial template for Bedtime Stories clichA(c)-mongering). The filmmakers likely set out to make a family film for the ages. To a degree they succeeded - assuming that the ""ages"" in question are under ten.

The perpetually juvenile actor has quietly become a fortysomething with a family. Presumably because his experiments with drama have gone largely unnoticed (most recently in ""Reign Over Me"") and audiences have tiptoed around his conscientious comedies such as last summers ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" Sandler has moved in an entirely different direction with ""Bedtime Stories."" Its a delightfully innocent movie that the actor can actually show to his two baby daughters without blushing. The concept behind ""Bedtime Stories"" is as ridiculous as any Sandler movie but its whimsical flair nonetheless makes it unique. As Skeeter Bronson Sandler plays a lowly handyman working at a hotel formerly owned by his father. The stars align for Skeeter to reclaim the property if he can develop a better theme for the buildings planned renovation than its current manager Kendall (Guy Pearce) a fawning metrosexual and the best-dressed villain of 2008. During a week spent baby-sitting with his adorable niece and nephew Skeeter discovers that the allegorical bedtime story he tells the kids -- with their eager participation in adding bizarre twists of course -- foreshadows what happens in his real life the next day. In attempting to take advantage of this magical power (who wouldnt?) he predictably learns that fortune females and a red Ferrari arent in the cards for his storys happy ending. Its a muddled and altogether generic lesson thats occasionally interrupted by a limp romantic subplot but the kids in the audience wont mind Theyll get a kick out of the quotable punch lines and the impressively imaginative visuals. For a childrens movie ""Bedtime Stories"" boasts a surprising amount of star wattage -- Keri Russell especially shines as Skeeters muse -- as well as loyal Sandler co-stars (Rob Schneider) and blooming comic talents in British entertainer Russell Brand and Minneapolis native Nick Swardson. The films PG rating (Sandlers first) is never threatened so concerns about crude humor can be assuaged -- unless your definition of crude humor includes a flatulent guinea pig. BEDTIME STORIES  out of 4 stars Rating PG for mild rude humor and mild language. The absence of dirty jokes may be the reason some adults wont find ""Bedtime Stories"" rip-roaringly funny but longtime Sandler fans may be surprised to find themselves surrendering to the movies playful spirit -- the kind of feeling you get when playing with your kids in the back yard or depending on your tradition attacking the presents under the tree on Christmas morning.

Comments Bedtime Stories In this uneven Disney comedy Adam Sandler tones down his arrested-development persona trading crass humor for warm fuzzies as a hotel janitor obliged to babysit his niece and nephew. To entertain them he improvises semiautobiographical bedtime yarns to which the kids contribute their own improvements. The film comes alive at the half-hour mark when as if by magic some of their story inventions--like the sky raining gum balls--start materializing in their uncles daily life. Richard Griffiths best gets the antic spirit of this enterprise relishing his multiple roles as Sandlers phobic boss and several fantasy characters (an ancient emperor a medieval king a sci-fi potentate). Director Adam Shankman (Hairspray) shows an affinity for fractured fairy tales but Guy Pearce and Lucy Lawless are miscast as Sandlers nemeses. PG 99 min.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 25 2008 1159 p.m. ET If time flowed backward for me as it does for Brad Pitt in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" I would have been almost three hours younger by the time the end credits rolled around. No such luck on that score but David Finchers majestic fantasy left me happier than I could have imagined Id be. Eric Roths screenplay inspired by a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald turns on a single device. A baby is born old -- not just old but downright senescent -- and youthens as he grows. Yet the film which co-stars Cate Blanchett quickly outgrows any sense of gimmickry and matures into a one-of-a-kind meditation on mortality times inexorable passage and the fleeting sweetness of love. Watch a scene from the film ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Time is of the essence in more ways than one. The production takes its time and uses it wisely in tracking Benjamins development from an ugly incubus through a teenage codger to a middle-aged 26-year-old whos certainly spry but still too old for Ms. Blanchetts Daisy. She is Bens contemporary a friend from their New Orleans childhood whos become an impossibly ravishing ballet dancer. Not until he grows 15 years younger and she grows 15 years older however are they right for each other physically as well as spiritually. ""My God"" Daisy says at one point in their mid-40s ""look at you -- youre perfect."" Its a charming laugh line since he has finally emerged as a fully recognizable Brad Pitt. And what a remarkable presence the actor is not just during that golden era but before and after when he has only his voice and eyes with which to fashion Bens character while the wonders of digital technology and age-confounding makeup provide his body and face. Its a great performance by any measure but let me count some of the other ways that Mr. Finchers film is remarkable. Ms. Blanchetts performance to be sure; shes breathtaking in a long red dress dancing in a fog-shrouded gazebo; otherwise shes simply dazzling and deeply affecting. A supporting cast that includes Tilda Swinton Taraji P. Henson Jason Flemyng and Jared Harris. Alexandre Desplats score as exquisite and evocative as the Scott Joplin concert waltz woven through it. Claudio Mirandas sumptuous cinematography Donald Graham Burts art direction and production design and Jacqueline Wests costumes. ""Benjamin Button"" is all of a visionary piece and its a soul-filling vision. Waltz With Bashir Ari Folmans ""Waltz With Bashir"" is an absolute stunner a feature-length animated documentary from Israel in which the force of moving drawings amplifies eerily powerful accounts of war shaky remembrance and rock-solid repression. See a clip from the film ""Waltz With Bashir."" Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. The film begins with the riveting image of vicious orange-eyed dogs coursing through the blue-black streets of nighttime Tel Aviv. By the time its over those dogs denizens of one ex-soldiers recurrent nightmare have been connected to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and to Israels indirect responsibility for a Christian militias massacre of Palestinian refugees. Connections were what Mr. Folman was after. A veteran of that war he made the film as an experiment in self-therapy after realizing how little he recalled of an experience that should have been as unforgettable as it was terrible. At bottom ""Waltz With Bashir"" -- the title relates to the battle rapture of an Israeli soldier in Beirut -- is a conventional documentary in which the filmmaker tries to elicit information from real-life countrymen who went to war with him. Yet it breaks with convention in two ways. The more obvious one is stylistic -- the testimony we hear often flattened and matter-of-fact is heightened by the sensational sometimes surreal animation. The other break is substantive and shocking. If connections were the goal disconnections are the discovery. Mr. Folmans witnesses dont remember their time in Lebanon any more reliably than he does so his self-therapy proves a failure. But his signal success lies in charting the human minds gift for keeping bad memories at bay. War is hell as everyone claims to know but heres a baleful new perspective on the subject. Wars are fought the film tells us then literally forgotten. Valkyrie Two dramatic arcs intersect in ""Valkyrie"" a big old-fashioned action adventure starring Tom Cruise as Claus von Stauffenberg the aristocratic German army colonel who in 1944 led the July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. In addition to the plot itself theres the arc of Mr. Cruises career from ""Risky Business"" to the riskier business of embodying an authentic German hero in a lavish English-language production with limited suspense; the audience -- at least some of it -- knows that the plot failed. So how does the film work? Well enough in the end. Mr. Cruises performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible though unexceptional while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural impressively staged in historical locations. See a clip from the film ""Valkyrie."" Video courtesy of United Artists. The director was Bryan Singer best known for ""The Usual Suspects""; he worked from a script by his writer on that film Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander. Newton Thomas Sigel did the stunning cinematography and Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb collaborated on the splendid production design. Mr. Singer comes as close as anyone could to sustaining the illusion of action when nothing is happening and nothing much happens for quite a while apart from the hatching of Stauffenbergs plot and the exchange of meaningful glances. (My favorite moment of throbbing inertia comes when someone says hes going to lunch and the announcement is met by a tympani roll.) Once the plotters plunge into action though ""Valkyrie"" becomes both an exciting thriller and a useful history lesson. Younger members of the audience may not have known that the Nazi armys officer corps contained nests of determined resistance to Hitlers madness. Revolutionary Road ""Revolutionary Road"" was adapted from Richard Yatess highly regarded novel about stifling conformity in 1950s suburbia. The movie is stifling all right and depressing in the bargain. The road of the title is the address of April and Frank Wheeler the couple played by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio; its also the figurative road that April wants them to follow an escape route from suburban life to the freedom of expatriate life in Paris. The best scene is the opening one when April and Frank first meet at a Manhattan party and he cheerfully admits that he has no idea what he wants to do with his life. In fact Frank is a black hole that sucks up whatever energy the movie musters. (Ms. Winslet has several powerful scenes and Zoe Kazan finds variety and spontaneity in the minor role of Franks sexual playmate at the office.) The pompous direction was inflicted by Sam Mendes who seems to regard the 1950s as a foreign country. Last Chance Harvey ""Last Chance Harvey"" is a good chance to see two superb actors having their way with wafer-thin material. Dustin Hoffmans Harvey and Emma Thompsons Kate meet by chance in London. Chance in this case means the laborious workings of an anti-surprise script; in scene after scene the outcome is clear from the start. The title also refers to Harveys plight. Long divorced and newly jobless he has flown in from New York for the wedding of his almost-estranged daughter and sees Kate as his last shot at a happy life. See a clip from ""Last Chance Harvey."" For a while Joel Hopkinss romantic comedy is little more than bright banter and naked contrivance. Parallel passages follow the equally lonely Harvey and Kate (she works in customer relations at Heathrow airport) as they dont meet again then almost do then do. But the film catches fire when Harvey brings Kate to the wedding reception. Thats where Mr. Hoffman seizes a good moment that the script has given him and turns it into a speech thats worth the price of admission. Suddenly the actors art transforms contrivance into the defining moment of a mans life. Marley amp; Me The Marley of ""Marley amp; Me"" is by his owners account the worlds worst dog. This is far from the worlds worst dog movie -- youd have to be made of granite to resist all the charms of a free-spirited 100-pound Lab. Yet the production manages against heavy odds to make its canine star an incorrigible bore. The problem is bad parenting. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston are John and Jenny Grogan a husband and wife who supposedly learn life lessons from Marley as their family grows through the years. What lessons though? They never seem to grasp the concept that dogs must be trained. Find related TV listings at LocateTV. Bedtime Stories Disneys ""Bedtime Stories"" looks cute in the trailers thanks to a bug-eyed computer-generated guinea pig named Bugsy. Be forewarned though. Bugsy is only a shill for a particularly crude and disjointed Adam Sandler comedy. If you listen carefully to the strains of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" during the Disney corporate intro you may hear Walt moaning in his grave. See a clip from ""Bedtime Stories."" Mr. Sandler is no stranger to crudity; its intrinsic to his slob esthetic. ""Im like the stink on your feet"" he says in this one ""Ill always be around."" Hes Skeeter Bronson a hotel handyman who tells his niece and nephew bedtime stories that have a magical way of coming true. (Theyre garishly overproduced stories that mimic ""Star Wars"" assorted Westerns and ""Spartacus."") Still the crudity here isnt confined to a few fart jokes. As a PG-rated film opening on Christmas Day under the Disney banner ""Bedtime Stories"" would seem to promise fairly wholesome family entertainment. What it delivers is the glitzy allure of a hotel setting smarmy double entendres Ferrari lust Beverly Hills bling and pneumatic babes -- one of the characters is a surrogate Paris Hilton. The real bug-eyed guinea pigs will be the little kids in the audience.

Movie review Adam Sandlers Bedtime Stories 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Bedtime Stories Comedy. Starring Adam Sandler Keri Russell and Guy Pearce. Directed by Adam Shankman. Written by Matt Lopez and Tim Herlihy. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In the first few minutes of Adam Sandlers latest over-the-top comedy his character - a smart-alecky slightly schlumpy hotel handyman - visits his sister and belittles her departed former husband. ""I wanted to give him a wedgie"" says Sandlers Skeeter Bronson ""but his underwear had holes in it."" This is the moment when audiences should realize that ""Bedtime Stories"" neuters Sandlers instincts for cutting-edge performance. Instead of crude jokes (""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"") amusing physicality (""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"") or even nuanced acting (""Reign Over Me"") we get Sandler in a kind of slow motion. He still moves quickly - riding horses chariots and motorcycles with wild abandon - but his persona is restrained in ""Bedtime Stories"" as if hed taken a Prozac before stepping in front of the camera. Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily - especially if youre between 6 and 10 years old or the parent of such children who appear to be the target audience of this Walt Disney production. The story line is Disney to the core Skeeter is an underappreciated figure who - like Cinderella - has been misjudged by close relations then gets a big chance to ascend the social and economic ladder. His opportunity comes when the hotels wealthy magnate Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths from ""The History Boys"" and ""Harry Potter"" films) offers him a chance to run the business - provided he can think up a new theme for the hotel. Skeeters plan though must top that of a rival hotel employee the snobby perfectly coiffed Kendall played with delightful campiness by Guy Pearce. The tragic backstory is that Bronsons dad Marty (Jonathan Pryce) once owned the hotel but poor management forced him to sell to the opportunistic Nottingham. Skeeters shot at redemption coincides with a weeklong assignment to look after the two children of his sister Wendy (Courteney Cox). Skeeter tells them bedtime stories about cowboys gladiators and space fighters that end up foretelling real events in his life. The stage is then set for a series of wild mildly amusing and utterly implausible events - including of course love. Coming in the same year as ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" (now out on an unrated DVD complete with scenes of Sandler ensconced in the flesh of older women) ""Bedtime Stories"" seems like an odd appendix to Sandlers career. But Sandler whos been in the public eye for two decades is now a 42-year-old father with a 2-year-old and infant and he said recently ""I wanted to make a movie that my (offspring) could watch someday and actually look me in the eyes afterwards."" Whether ""Bedtime Stories"" is that movie is open to debate. As they get older Sandlers children may see their dads newest flick for what it really is - a big-budget film thats full of sophomoric humor (such as horse farts and an angry midget) and fantastical special effects that imagine all the main characters in different time periods (from the Roman era to a Space Age future). Still ""Bedtime Stories"" is a fun bit of escapism thats even tender in spots especially when the children whom Sandler reads to are onscreen. In one scene for example Skeeters niece - cute big-eyed Laura Ann Kesling - changes the ending of his story about ""Sir Fixalot"" from one of cynicism to one of hope. The bedtime stories change Skeeters more than he ever imagined though we still get a slice of the Sandler who first made it big on ""Saturday Night Live."" ""Im like the stink on your feet"" he tells the kids a faint smirk on his face. ""Ill always be around."" For prepubescent kids ""Bedtime Stories"" will be a perfectly enjoyable work - a PG-rated introduction to a heralded comic actor trying to inspire a new generation of Adam Sandler fans.

ABOUT THE MOVIEBedtime Stories  (out of four)Stars Adam Sandler Keri Russell Guy Pearce Richard Griffiths Russell Brand Courteney Cox Jonathan PryceDirector Adam ShankmanDistributor DisneyRating PG for some mild rude humor and mild languageRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Thursday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY When it comes to holiday tales it would be best to reread The Night Before Christmas rather than waste time or money on Bedtime Stories. Adam Sandlers latest feels as if its barely going through the motions. Sandler is reasonably likable but the only actor who is somewhat lively in a cast of substantial actors with small roles is British comedian Russell Brand (Forgetting Sarah Marshall). The fantasy segments played up in trailers get bogged down amid the ho-hum tale of a loser making good. That loser is Sandlers Skeeter a hotel handyman who grew up in a homey motel owned by his father (Jonathan Pryce) until it was sold to a high-stakes businessman cut from Hilton cloth (Richard Griffiths) who turned it into a luxury hotel. Skeeter must watch his niece and nephew while his sister (Courteney Cox) is out of town. Clueless about what to do with them he tells stories -- and eventually discovers that the tales possess more power than mere escapist fantasies. For some reason he barely knows these kids -- though they live in the same city. Its explained lamely that Wendys ex-husband didnt like Skeeter so he wasnt welcome at their home. Its not difficult to imagine someone not being a fan of Skeeters He comes across like an annoying overgrown kid -- just another variation of Sandlers standard goofy boyish Everydoofus. But since hes the star of the movie were supposed to root for him in a contest established to manage a new hotel. Skeeters love life evolves in similar movieland cliche. He shares babysitting duties with Wendys friend Jill (Keri Russell) who takes an instant dislike to him. So its obvious they are destined to fall madly in love. While the fairy-tale scenarios have some entertaining moments dont expect anything as involving as The Princess Bride or the more recent offbeat The Fall. Both offered far more imaginative takes on stories coming to vivid life. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Bedtime Stories Better suited to a kegger crowd | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentBedtime Stories Better suited to a kegger crowdA family friendly Disney movie is far from a natural habitat for the sort of crude belligerent characters that have long been Adam Sandlers forte. Nope wings night at Hooters is more their style.By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarWed. Dec. 24 2008 Starring Adam Sandler Keri Russell and Guy Pearce. Directed by Adam Shankman. 98 minutes. At major theatres. G  A family friendly Disney movie is far from a natural habitat for the sort of crude belligerent characters that have long been Adam Sandlers forte. Nope wings night at Hooters is more their style. Article Continued BelowNevertheless Hollywood logic demands that if Night at the Museum can make an inoffensive hero out of an actor previously best known for getting his nether parts caught in a zipper then surely theres a way to make the man-child behind Happy Gilmore safe enough for actual children to enjoy.Its no surprise then that the two main ingredients in Bedtime Stories - colourful holiday-appropriate schmaltz and Sandlers aggressively sophomoric brand of comedy - dont always coalesce. In fact it sometimes feels as if the Museum-like fantasy scenes belong in a whole other movie than the jokes about angry dwarves and little girls being described as ""hot."" Yet Sandlers insistence on retaining his Sandler-ness despite the cuddly context is also what makes Bedtime Stories watchable - wildly erratic the movies also very funny in the rare moments when the hybrid proves viable. Sandler plays Skeeter Bronson a handyman at a Los Angeles hotel that used to belong to his late father. Though Skeeter still believes that new owner Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) will someday make good on his promise to Skeeters pop to let him run the place hes unlikely to usurp Kendall (Guy Pearce) the slick sycophantic manager whos dating Nottinghams socialite daughter Violet (Teresa Palmer). Skeeters also not much of a family man. But when his sister Wendy (Courteney Cox) has to go out of town he plays dad to her kids Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit) sharing the responsibility with Jill (Keri Russell) his sisters friend and his soon-to-be love interest.Since his storybook options have names like The Organic Squirrel Wears a Bike Helmet Skeeter opts to do what his father did with him and spins some fresh yarns for the moppets. Elements of the stories he tells - rendered on screen in a variety of movie styles from Monty Python-esque medieval tale to Spaceballs-y science-fiction spoof - soon appear for real. Whats most amusing about it is the manner in which Skeeter attempts to manipulate this unexplained phenomenon for his own ends His storytelling increasingly involves free sports cars women in bikinis and cameos for Rob Schneider. Of course Skeeter is not rewarded for his more selfish inclinations - instead his attempts to direct events have increasingly chaotic results. That hes kind of a jerk about it all is oddly refreshing for a Disney hero. Likewise the movies wilder comedic impulses give the proceedings some spark. Russell Brand the British comedian who stole Forgetting Sarah Marshall with his turn as a sleazy but affable rock star provides many of the best moments as Skeeters dim-witted best mate. As for Sandler he manages to mollify his more abrasive tendencies without going too soft. Ironically the results are less sappy than some of his nominally more adult-oriented hits like Big Daddy and Click. Unfortunately all this makes Bedtime Stories more of a Sandler movie than a Disney one. Judged as a piece of family entertainment its too haphazard and poorly paced to satisfy viewers too young to have ever attended a kegger.

Alice in Wonderland comes to mind and Peter Pan. Its hard to imagine the tales of Bedtime Stories - fantasies set in ancient Rome the Middle Ages the Old West and outer space - becoming classics although they serve the goofball purposes of Adam Sandler well enough in this antic family vehicle. Directed by Adam Shankman (Hairspray) Bedtime Stories stars the man behind Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer as Skeeter Bronson a sad-sack hotel-maintenance dude. When Skeeters school principal sister (Courtney Cox) goes out of town her flaky sibling is recruited to look after the kids. And so Skeeter regales his niece and nephew - and their pop-eyed guinea pig Bugsy - with improvised adventures and tales of derring-do. When the kids add details of their own (gumballs raining from the sky for instance) the next day these things come true. Sloppy choppy and saved by an affably low-key and typically sophomoric Sandler performance Bedtime Stories follows Skeeter as he competes with a sycophantic hotel manager (Guy Pearce in an uncomfortable stab at comedy) for a top job in the Nottingham Hotel empire. Owner Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) has known Skeeter since he was a child but has never given him the shot he deserves. Now thanks to this weird storytelling magic Skeeter has his chance at career advancement. And even when Skeeters tongue swells up (a wasp bite) and he has to mumble an important presentation to the hotel higher-ups things work out in his favor - thanks to an able translating assist from his pal (the amusingly dopey Russell Brand). Im not sure why so many Brits and Aussies populate this Disney-produced family flick. In addition to U.K.-ers Griffiths and Brand Jonathan Pryce shows up too. Along with Pearce theres Teresa Palmer - as the hoteliers heiress a quasi-Paris Hilton - who also hails from Down Under. (And the snotty concierge is played by Lucy Lawless a.k.a. Xena of New Zealand.) But Bedtime Stories does have a comic buoyancy even as its plot trots on a predictable course. Perhaps the different accents and sensibilities have something to do with that. Also along for the ride is the bright and beaming Keri Russell as a school teacher who at first doesnt think much of Skeeter - and who by the end is taking a romantic stroll on the Santa Monica sands with her improbable love interest. Bedtime Stories endorses that kind of happily-ever-after fantasy after all. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Turns out they were the grown-up efforts. ""Bedtime Stories"" Sandlers bizarrely clunky kiddie flick is a sort of upside-down ""Princess Bride."" This time the fantastic fairy tales told to a little boy and girl are only about one-tenth of the movie. The rest deal with the dreary life of their storyteller Uncle Skeeter (Sandler) ""a gum-scraping handyman"" who dreams of running the hotel once owned by his father (Jonathan Pryce). Bankrupt the old man sold out to a germophobic entrepreneur (Richard Griffiths) who leaves management duties to the suck-up boyfriend (Guy Pearce) of his socialite daughter (Teresa Palmer). Skeeter commiserates with a waiter (Russell Brand) who has little to do except fall asleep and wake up screaming every few minutes. (Whats with all these Brits and Australians in a film set in LA? Did Sandler offer to pay in lager?) Skeeters laid-off sister (Courteney Cox) asks him to take care of her two kids whose teacher/baby sitter (Keri Russell) is a Prius-driving priss who turns up her nose at Skeeters rumbling pickup truck. All of these ""real-life"" characters pop up in costume in the silly tales Skeeter spins for the kids. The stories (theyre about a cowboy knight chariot racer and space cowboy) last only a couple of minutes each and none of them goes anywhere as the kids toss in non sequiturs such as ""and then he got kicked by a dwarf"" or ""then he found a fat hairy guy unconscious on the beach."" The fantasy sequences offer little in the way of laughs or thrills relying on cut-rate special effects and random instances of goofiness - one of which the slime-spewing ""booger monster"" in a ""Star Wars"" spoof will probably be dubbed the scene of the year by 5-year-olds. It takes until halfway through this pokey movie for the point of anything to kick in The story elements contributed by the kids al- ways come true in Skeeters real life. If they say all the girls who were mean to him in high school are going to dance the hokey-pokey around him then thats exactly what happens the next time he walks into a bar pointless though it may be. Skeeter is hoping the kids will come up with a story that will lead to him winning a contest involving pitching ideas for a theme hotel. Unfortunately for him in the last story he told the kids they had his character get ""incineratated."" You could do a lot with the format particularly the idea of the wackiest parts of the stories coming true in unexpected ways. Instead they come true in the most insipid unimaginative ways. If Abraham Lincoln is supposed to show up in Skeeters life then someone drops a penny near him. Exciting. Skeeters ""real life"" antics involve him screeching his lines at glass-breaking pitch throwing french fries at his waiter friend (Sandler and Brand make a weirdly mismatched comedy team) singing ""Rock Me Amadeus"" in his truck or getting his wallet stolen (by Rob Schneider who seems to have no other employment these days besides being Sandlers cameo guy). When Sandler wails ""for freeeeee"" in an attempt to get laughs youll long for the relative genius of ""Click."" Director Adam Shankman misses no opportunity to cut to the kids pet a moony-eyed gerbil that eats smores possibly because the rodent gives the best performance in the movie. BEDTIME STORIES Youll fight to keep your eyes open. Running time 95 minutes. Rated PG (mildly crude humor). At the Lincoln Square the Orpheum the E-Walk others.

With Adam Sandler Keri Russell Courteney Cox. Director Adam Shankman. (135) PG Comic violence. At area theaters.It now seems inevitable that Adam Sandler would be a kids clown. With that helium-high mushmouth voice hangdog face and ability to see the silly in everything Sandler is essentially an overgrown child. In his first full-on live-action family film ""Bedtime Stories"" hes like a grade-schoolers dream baby-sitter - a big brother/stuffed animal combo who knows where the soda and candy are hidden. As Skeeter Bronson Sandler is the son of a motel operator whose little Los Angeles bungalow was bought by a lumpy developer (Richard Griffiths) and mega-sized into a Trumpian behemoth. Now managed by the snotty mover-and-shaker Kendall (Guy Pearce) the hotel still employs Skeeter as a frustrated handyman. His fantasies of heroism get to be played out when he watches his niece and nephew while his sister (Courteney Cox) is away for a week. Sharing duties with his sisters friend Jill (Keri Russell) Skeeter tells adventure tales before sleep and so we see him Jill and Kendall in various scenarios - knight cowboy gladiator ""Star Wars""-like space adventure. The kids contributions to his stories start to come true not so much by magic as by coincidence. So when Skeeter has a chance to present a new plan for the hotel he needs their rich ideas to make real magic happen. The movies ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" structure allows Sandler to be goofy in different settings yet like the similar ""Night at the Museum"" ""Bedtime Stories"" champions imagination while having too little originality itself. Still that wont matter to the younguns wholl appreciate a booger monster in space and a funny-looking guinea pig. Kids Laura Ann Kesling and Jonathan Morgan Heit are cute and its always a pleasure to see Russell though Griffiths Pearce and Lucy Lawless as a nasty hotel concierge overdo the cartoonishness. But Sandlers shambling Yogi Bear-ness will be the big appeal. Whats funny is how the former ""SNL"" star tries too hard in his mainstream summer comedies though in dramatic jaunts (""Punch-Drunk Love"" ""Spanglish"" ""Reign Over Me"") or now family fare Sandler seems most at home.

But Bedtime Stories is even worse than his innocuous Hanukkah cartoon Eight Crazy Nights (2002). Its a dispirited galumphing mess in which Sandler as a hotel handyman who spins out tall tales for his niece and nephew pictures himself in assorted historical-kitsch guises (doofus medieval peasant doofus Wild West cowpoke doofus space warrior etc.) all of which add up to a soggier sponge cake of a time-trip burlesque than Mel Brooks History of the World Part I.

Unfortunately great books dont always make great movies and Bedtime Stories is far from a great film. Adam Sandler in agreeable-naif mode plays Skeeter a maintenance worker with dreams of running the hotel that employs him. Of course he has a villain to deal with Kendall (Guy Pearce) is a dandy with impeccable manners and plans for taking over the hotel. Skeeter has to care for his niece and nephew for one week while his sister (Courteney Cox) goes out of town for a job interview. She is overprotective and health-conscious; The Organic Squirrel Gets a Bicycle Helmet is one of the childrens favorite storybooks. Rather than indulge in such green fiction Skeeter creates original tales to entertain the kids before bedtime. The children add their own twists to the stories which all involve characters from their real lives. The hook is that whatever the kids describe will happen to Skeeter the next day albeit in a slightly twisted interpretation. For instance the kids say he will encounter Abraham Lincoln and he finds a Lincoln penny. Not exactly a laugh riot but cute. The movie runs into trouble with its multiple fantasy sequences. We see what Skeeter and the children describe so we get Sandler in gladiator garb or as an intergalactic boxer. The film pretty much stops dead during these moments. Theyre not funny and because theres never any suspense in how the fantasies will play out they repeatedly land with a thud. Unfortunately the ""realistic"" segments are not particularly engaging either. Sandler is appealing but Keri Russell has nothing to do as a potential love interest. Other cast members are wasted with Pearce playing his role cartoonishly broad. British bad-boy comic Russell Brand plays Skeeters best pal and putting him in a Disney family comedy is like having Lil Wayne open for the Wiggles. The comedian just seems straitjacketed. Director Adam Shankman had better luck with his last film the energetic musical Hairspray. Here the result is akin to a version of The Wizard of Oz in which both Oz and Kansas are presented in dull sepia tones. On the other hand the novelization of the screenplay probably would make a pretty decent bedtime story.

Sandler brought his repertory company ( Rob Schneider) to Disney for this holiday disappointment about a wacky uncle whose fantastical bedtime stories come true.First theres a prologue about a hotelier dad ( Jonathan Pryce) who told his kids great ""Once upon a times"" in the days before he sold out to a hotel chain. Today Skeeter (Sandler) is handyman at L.A.s Sunny Vista Nottingham longing for the day when the owners promise to his late father -- that hed get to manage the place -- comes true. But slithery Kendall (Guy Pearce over-the-top) has angled an engagement with the owners Paris Hiltonish daughter to land that job.Meanwhile Skeeters sister Wendy ( Courteney Cox) is a newly divorced newly laid-off school principal who needs him to watch her kids for a week. Hell do nights. Wendys pal Jill ( Keri Russell) will watch them during the day. Jill is just like Wendy -- a martinet who is all about health foods and no TV. Whats an Uncle Buck er Skeeter to do? Why tell bedtime tales about knights and cowboys and charioteers and galactic warriors none of whom get the respect (or promotion) they deserve. Funny thing about the stories. When the kids pitch in and ""improve"" them they come true. Skeeter competes for the promotion and a kiss from ""the fairest in all the land."" Oh and gumballs rain from the sky. Skeeter tries to manipulate the stories.Hairspray hero Adam Shankman takes a GIGANTIC step backward with this. He must have seen something in the fanciful flashbacks where Skeeter and friends ( Russell Brand of Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bland waiter pal) and enemies (Pearce) show up as sidekicks villainous knights or unworthy sycophants to the Emperor. Special effects stuntmen and editing dont quite hide that Sandler isnt doing this shtick.The big kiddie laugh here is a bug-eyed (digitally assisted) hamster that pops into the picture any time the script-by-committee runs out of ideas. Yup we see a lot of ""Bugsy."" Sandlers blank-faced mugging takes the form of not-that-funny silly voices. Again the script isnt helping. Best line?""Havent you heard? Goofys the new handsome."" The comic changing of the guard thats been evident in recent years makes this a smart career move for Sandler. Wacky PG-13 character comedies are out. R-rated ""realistic"" comedies are in. Disney has been hunting around for the ""New Tim Allen"" for a while now. Lets see -- no success in serious films an inexpressive face a gift for making weird voices? Maybe theyve found him. The accountants must be thrilled.

Not long ago it would have been inconceivable to see the words ""Adam Sandler"" and ""Disney family film"" in the same sentence but parenthood does strange things to people. With ""Bedtime Stories"" Sandler has delivered on his promise to make a movie his kids can enjoy. Whats more hes managed to do so without alienating his core audience. While the comedy -- about a hotel handyman whose outlandish tales spring to life -- clearly skews to a younger demo theres enough sophomoric humor here to reassure the Sandler faithful. Combo of Sandler regulars plus family audiences augurs well for a B.O. happy ending. From the outset ""Bedtime Stories"" has a fanciful whimsical spirit -- hardly surprising given that its helmer Adam Shankman put the sparkle in ""Hairspray."" Working from a script by Matt Lopez and frequent Sandler scribe Tim Herlihy Shankman has conjured a world in which bad things (divorce corporate greed) do exist but good things (a spontaneous gumball shower) are always just around the corner. Skeptics should check their disbelief at the door for this fantasy. A brief prologue establishes Sandlers character Skeeter As a boy (played by Thomas Hoffman) he watched his dad Marty (Jonathan Pryce narrating) run the family motel business into the ground. Forced to sell the motel to zealous developer Barry Nottingham (Herlihy in flashback Richard Griffiths throughout) Marty saw his dreams evaporate. Some 30 years later Skeeter is fixing toilets and tweaking TV sets as the highrise Nottingham Hotels lowly maintenance man only to watch brown-nosing manager Kendall (a conniving Guy Pearce) become Nottinghams designated successor. Skeeter meanwhile covets Nottinghams party-girl daughter Violet (Aussie Teresa Palmer); his offbeat pal Mickey (Russell Brand hilarious but underused) lends a supportive ear. When Skeeters sister (Courteney Cox) goes out of town she asks Skeeter to babysit her kids Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit). He shares the task with her friend Jill (imminent love interest Keri Russell delightful). Skeeter quickly learns the path to avuncular success involves elaborate bedtime stories. Inspired by aspects of Skeeters daily life the tales are vividly enacted onscreen. Like most kids Bobbi and Patrick have their own story ideas (guess who suggests the gumball deluge). The first tale set in medieval times posits Sandler as the underappreciated Sir Fix-a-lot repeatedly trounced by Sir Buttkiss (Pearce). When Skeeters tale concludes on a pessimistic note the kids demand a new ending in which Fix-a-lot gets another chance to impress the king (Griffiths). The next day Skeeter is the beneficiary of a surprise reversal from Nottingham that sets up a climactic showdown with Kendall. Skeeter soon discovers the kids story edits can also impact his own life. Future bedtime stories take him to the Old West (as cowboy Jeremiah Skeets) ancient Rome (chariot-riding Skeetacus) and outer space (futuristic warrior Skeeto). Final reel weaves together several story strands and gives Skeeter a long-awaited chance at personal redemption. In a series of tasks worthy of Hercules -- or at least Skeetacus -- our hero must save the kids win over his true love and defeat his nemesis. Of course it wouldnt be a Sandler movie without a little crude humor so watch for a booger monster a bee-stung tongue and a snot-nosed dog. Upstaging the dog for comic relief though is Bugsy a guinea pig with Marty Feldman eyes. A CG/live-action composite that grownups may find annoying but young moviegoers will adore Bugsy is the latest evidence of Hollywoods bizarre current obsession with benign rodents (to wit the hamster in ""Bolt"" the rat in ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" and the casts of ""Ratatouille"" ""Flushed Away"" and ""The Tale of Despereaux""). From Linda DeScennas evocative multiperiod production design to costume designer Rita Ryacks imaginative togs from the elaborate visual effects overseen by John Andrew Berton Jr. to Michael Barretts colorful lensing tech work is at a very high level. Rupert Gregson-Williams score adds muscle and momentum throughout and complements a well-selected roster of tunes culminating in Journeys ubiquitous ""Dont Stop Believing.""
