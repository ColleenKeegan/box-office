Writer Peter Morgan (The Queen The Last King of Scotland) again ventures into the parlours of the rich and powerful to excavate a crisis. This time its the marital and succession woes of Henry VIII (Eric Bana) and their knock-on effects on two noble sisters Anne and Mary Boleyn who are vying for the eye of a broody king egged on by their father (Mark Rylance) and their scheming uncle Thomas Howard (David Morrissey playing Alastair Campbell to Rylances Blair). Its no doubt a producers wet dream to cast Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman as the two Boleyn girls. Johansson is the domestically-inclined Mary (What about our future in the country? she grumbles in Good Housekeeping fashion to her drippy husband) and Portman (more successfully) is the more forthright Anne newly and unconvincingly emboldened by a spell at the French court (its a small mercy she doesnt return with a copy of The Second Sex under her arm). The pairs stellar presence at least fits the films Holbein-meets-Annie Leibovitz colour palette; lets call it the Vanity Fayre look.Polite well-made adequately performed moderately paced - television director Justin Chadwicks take on Philippa Gregorys racy trashy novel is everything you dont want it to be. Morgans script is workable if skeletal and possessed of some odd turns of speech (Would you accept the challenge? Howard asks Anne imitating a gameshow host as he pushes her towards Henry). The film takes itself too seriously (see the literal dark clouds over the palace) and never ignites as it should in a storm of rivalries fear sex and religion. Theres a 15-minute period of paranoia as Annes relationship with Henry (a brooding Bana sidelined) falls to pieces and you wish there was more of this. Where are the sparks? The dirt? The sex? And wheres Cardinal Wolsey while were at it? Most memorable are the costumes.

Read the book which I really enjoyed. This was hacked to peices with no real sense of attachment to the caracters. Didnt really care what happened to them. Stilted English accents didnt help either.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 20 2008JackieFeaturedI havent read the book or studied the period so Im commenting on this purely as a film when I say it was very disappointing. There was so much potential to be good firstly with the talented cast (Natalie Portman is utterly amazing when she hits her stride) and with the material but it just never went up a gear. It was just reasonably engaging keeping you watching while you waited for something to explode but as massive historical events slipped quietly by with seemingly little drama you started to realise that it wasnt going to happen. Bana was a fairly bland Henry failing to capture the charm or charisma of a king who utterly embodied the concept of courtly romance (ok I have studied the period a wee bit) and he displayed no real sense of passion or frustration in his relationship with Anne. The only relationship that seemed at all developed was his one with Mary which built very sweetly from their first night together and then culminated in his poignant letter to her after she begged him to spare Anne. Perhaps that was intentional as the title of the novel/film suggests a shift in focus from Anne onto Mary but the opportunity for a great contrast between the two sistersaEUR(tm) relationships with the king was sorely missed by the lack of chemistry or sparks between Anne and Henry. On a positive note the costumes were great ;-)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 22 2008LouFeaturedI cant believe they missed so much out and left so much rubbish in. Raping Anne was ridiculous as were the massive plot holes such as Carey not dieing catherine not being born - and yet mentioned later the meeting at hever in thebeginiing. It was all awful. And why was anne walking around with her hair covered one day and not the next when unmaried? Surely she would not have had it covered at all? ih. And how did her and henrys wedding come from nowhere? where was the 6 year courtship in which she shined above all other women?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 11 2008natishaFeaturedI thought the movie was better than I thought it would be.

It is just the right level of shallowness and fool-hardiness for such viewers. I agree with Ella and Collette it was awful. But I guess itaEUR(tm)s our fault that we expected something good from it. IaEUR(tm)ve never seen an adequate adaptation of a good book by Hollywood especially where history is concerned.

They are just about as deep as this film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 24 2008BriannarchyFeaturedDeeply disappointed. Why does Scarlett Johanssen have to look vacant the whole time and why does she never close her mouth? Eric Bana didnt convince me as Henry and was pretty one dimensional. By the end of the film my friend and I were cringeing - particularly when Scarlett rushes through the court shouting give me the child....what a missed opportunity...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 24 2008EllaFeaturedI have never been so disappointed in a film. An utter waste of time. The film does in no way justice to the book. The storyline has been twisted and changed so much its hard to recognise the original story. A story which is being told over a decade and more a story in which the love for the queen as well as the king torments Mary a story which portrays her struggle between love and hate for her family and her husband (who rather inconveniently doesnt die in the movie - has noone thought about how shes able to marry Stafford when shes not been widowed yet???) Ommitting one of Marys children and several of Annes miscarriages ommitting the years of torment and struggle of Henry to free himself of Katherine and also ommitting Georges love for another man... There is so much missing in this movie its a surprise it can still claim to be based on P. Gregorys novel.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 24 2008JoeFeaturedI thought the film was truly schmutz.

I read the book and loved it; for all its trashiness it was still full of all the lovely grim stuff you would expect from a setting at the Tudor court. But the film... Well to say it was dumbed down is an understatement. Were we to assume that everything happened in a short space of time and that nobody aged? The novel brilliantly shows the contrast between Henrys young court; full of jousting merriment and male bonding and his later darker fatter years. And yet the film was portrayed in what seemed like like one bleak shot. The character of Mary should have narrated as she does in the novel to give the viewer a better understanding of her and her relationship with her sister. Indeed I think it was a crime that Morgan never thought of this. My favourite line in the whole film came from the Boleyn mother ( magically turned in to quite a nice sympathetic women to keep the audience happy) who said ""that wuold mean breaking with Catholic church?"" Really? Never Not that there were many other churches around at that time... This film was as usual watered down and idiot proof. A complete shambles that is an insult to Phillipa Gregory.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 17 2008Tom McMasterFeaturedInteresting historical drama with some fine performances none better than Natalie Portman who plays Anne Boleyn to perfection complemented extremely well by Scarlett Johannson.

I found the film to be mildly entertaining and the insight in to the story from Anne Boleyns view was interesting however the script and the performances lacked excitement and conviction. Scarlett Johanssens Mary in particular was fairly weak. I wanted much more from Natalie Portmans Anne but ultimately felt that she did her best with a script that very much seemed like Footballers Wives in the sixteenth century. Whenever a scene got vagueley interesting the action moved on several months with little character development giving a sense of spoon feeding the key information to the audeince in order to rush the film to its conclusion. All in all quite disappointing. I had high hopes for this film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 9 2008Ray JubbFeaturedAn excellent production and insight into an important period of English history.

It is a fairy tale and really good fun. However if he wants to see a dark visceral dirty sexy fabulous cool daring innovative version of The Other Boleyn Girl he should get hold of a copy of the highly acclaimed BBC TV version which starred Jodhi May and Natasha Macelhone and Jared Harris - all who give stunning performances. This exceptional film made on a tiny budget is much more sophisticated and truly gripping. The critics loved it. Lets hope it comes out on dvd here as it is in the states.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 7 2008arnold huntFeaturedThe bad tempered review above by dave calhoun does not begin to do justice to the quality of this film. All right there may be no sparks dirt or sex - well it is restrained even understated but many of the most formidable emotions are best delineated thus. In fact everyone acts their socks off and the performances are uniformly thrilling - even the smaller parts for example when hapless queen catherine passes the two sisters in one of the corridors of court and remarks Ah the Boleyn whores I defy anyone not to be moved at her humiliation. How absurd that your reviewer should think the film would be improved by the presence of cardinal wolsey the film is about the two sisters for heavens sake. See it - once you are over the first few minutes in which there are some glaring anachronisms of dialogue it is a marvellous thing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/85169/the-other-boleyn-girl.html,200,theotherboleyngirl0,theotherboleyngirl,timeout

At times it strains to be a stately period drama about 16th-century political intrigue. Then it devolves into soap opera muck and emerges as a rather tame bodice ripper. CLIP Get in on the intrigue of The Other Boleyn Girl Its not that a good production cant be both a thrilling tale of historical intrigue and sensual adventures but this film doesnt convince in either category. Based on Philippa Gregorys 1992 novel the visuals are artful as is the production design. Its the lack of character development and the plodding story that keep the audience from becoming engaged. The Boleyn sisters -- Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) -- vie for the attentions of the womanizing King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) initially spurred on by the ruthless machinations of their social-climbing father (Mark Rylance) and conniving uncle the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey). Only the girls mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) sees the folly that will come of using their daughters to gain royal status for the family. Mary is pure of heart and falls in love with Henry becoming his mistress. Anne who had hoped to become his consort is deeply jealous of her sister. Fueled by pettiness and vengeance over what she considers her sisters betrayal she calculatingly dazzles Henry persuading him to leave his wife Catherine of Aragon and defy the Catholic Church to marry her. The story is more about the girls sibling rivalry than it is about Henry VIIIs dalliances or his historic split with the church. The ambitions and single-minded quest for power of the girls father and uncle come off as cliched muting the sense of outrage we are surely supposed to be feeling. Morrissey and Rylance are stock villains and Mary feels like a medieval Melanie from Gone With the Wind to Annes Scarlett OHara. In Wind we had a sense of what motivated those women. Here they seem like cardboard cutouts. Another flaw lies in the depiction of Henry. He must have been more complex than the simple skirt-chaser he is made out to be. He boasts of his ability to judge character and see through artifice and is drawn to Mary because of her guileless nature. Yet seemingly overnight he falls under the sway of the relentless and seductive Anne with unconvincing gullibility. More must have been at play for Henry to be so easily controlled by this diva. Anne is spurred not by love but by power. She yearns to be queen but as anyone with a little knowledge of history knows her determination leads to her demise. The story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn has been told before. The 1969 drama Anne of the Thousand Days starring Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold was a far more compelling piece of historical fiction than this oversimplified overheated mediocre melodrama.

"The Other Boleyn Girl Vulgarized Tudormania | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Other Boleyn Girl Vulgarized Tudormania If youre a TV or film producer you cant go wrong with the Tudors.By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. Feb. 29 2008Starring Natalie Portman Scarlett Johansson Eric Bana Kristen Scott Thomas Ana Torrent. Directed by Justin Chadwick. Written by Peter Morgan from the novel by Philippa Gregory. 115 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  If youre a TV or film producer you cant go wrong with the Tudors.In 1970 the BBC struck it rich with its series The Six Wives of Henry VIII followed by Elizabeth R an almost equally popular sequel about Henrys daughter. Currently we have on television The Tudors in which Henry VIII manages to find a few minutes to rule his kingdom in between bouts of achieving orgasm.On the big screen there have been countless movies featuring the dynasty and its victims the latest of which is The Other Boleyn Girl.This entry observes the most up-to-date formula for exploiting Tudormania which seems to be sex colourful costumes sex the excitement of pounding hooves on the sound track as riders race to and fro on important errands sex stately castles and sumptuous backdrops plus snippets of history and sex.Article Continued BelowThe new wrinkle in this English Renaissance soap opera is Anne Boleyns sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson). Anne (Natalie Portman) who mostly goes through the movie with a smirk on her face calls Mary ""My golden sister my little milk and honey sister."" Its the dynamic beloved in movies and literature of the fair-haired innocent woman versus the more tempestuous and complicated dark-haired lady - in this case the brunette Anne.Its hard to stay innocent whatever the colour of your hair when you belong to the Boleyn family. ""To get ahead in this world you need more than fair looks and a kind heart"" says Marys father a little engine of ambition. He marries kind-hearted Mary to a prosperous local farmer. Unfortunately the couple experiences the most unsatisfactory onscreen wedding night since Robert Mitchum clumsily deflowered his bride in Ryans Daughter and the next thing we see by coincidence or not is Mary catching the eye of Henry VIII (Eric Bana).With his one word command ""tonight"" Henry summons Mary to his bedchamber. (Those Tudor monarchs sure knew how to sweet-talk a girl.) Anne smoulders with jealousy until she figures out a way to brush Mary aside mostly by flirting with the king and then playing hard to get. ""You should not have given yourself too lightly"" she tells her sister rather unfeelingly.The rest we all know. The interest of the movie lies in how freshly it can recreate familiar historical events such as Henrys divorce from his first queen Katherine of Aragon his subsequent marriage to Anne and her downfall. Certain puzzles must be addressed. Annes brother was accused of incestuous relations with her for example - how is the movie to deal with that item in the historical record?The movie is not stupid in its interpretation of these and other events but it stumbles over the problem of how to make its characters speak like real personages out of the English Renaissance. We can be sure they didnt speak like us. Its a historic trade-off. We have better hygiene and dentistry than they did - they had more beautiful language. Annes father surely expressed himself more vigorously in quarrelling with his wife than by saying things like ""Why dont you look on the bright side just once""Then theres Marys interrogation by her uncle after her first night with Henry. ""Was he satisfied?"" he barks. Maybe Henry was just faking orgasms - an imposture that clever Mary would be sure to detect in the uncles view. On a much different note Anne chirps like a clever marketing exec urging that a brand be repositioned when she urges Henry to ""become head of a new church - the Church of England""Only Ana Torrent as the wronged queen Katherine of Aragon speaks with genuine passion and conviction. When she complains of her treatment at the hands of her husband the audience believes her. Its the one note of authenticity in an otherwise vulgarized portrayal of the Tudor court.

The extremely watchful eyes since the girls are Mary and Anne Boleyn and their father Sir Thomas sees them as property to be traded for power and wealth in the England of Henry VIII. As we know from our reading of history -- or more entertainingly from the Philippa Gregory novel this movie is based on -- one of the sisters will come to a bad end while the other wont. The movie which stars Scarlett Johansson as Mary Natalie Portman as Anne and Eric Bana as Henry trades factual accuracy and the novels political intricacies for the juiciness of sex and sibling rivalry and dispenses some delicious juice. Eventually though motherhood takes a heavy toll on Mary Annes scheming to become queen turns her into a shrew -- uneasy rests the head that wrests the crown -- and the whole thing ends rather gloomily. See a clip from ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" Courtesy of Sony Pictures. How could it end otherwise you may ask Anne loses her head in a way that most heedless young women do not. But the book isnt cast as tragedy and neither is the film along much of its long winding road to the executioners platform. The director Justin Chadwick (who directed the BBCs recent glorious version of ""Bleak House"") and the screen writer Peter Morgan (who did the scintillating script for ""The Queen"") quickly set a serio-comic tone for the two fine actresses playing the Boleyn girls. First its Annes turn to charm the king. Shes a busy little bee of a seducer flashing absurdly beautiful smiles and tossing off suggestive phrases; the seduction sequence is staged as sophisticated comedy. (""With no man to hold on to how do you propose to stay on the horse?"" Henry asks as she settles into a saddle. ""As you do my grace"" she replies. ""With my thighs.""). When headstrong Anne defeats herself with an excess of zeal sweet Mary is thrown into the breach as a glorified call girl except that its the king who comes calling. ENLARGE Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson in The Other Boleyn Girl. King Henry has been lightened up considerably from the womanizing lout of the book but hes still a cheerless presence and there isnt much that Mr. Bana can do about it apart from making him handsome. The filmmakers craftsmanship coarsens as the sisters rivalry grows bitter foreshadowing tragedy. Mary conceives but finds herself imprisoned by a precarious pregnancy. Anne returns from her banishment in France as a newly minted feminist convinced that shes been betrayed by her suffering sister. So many events some of which happen offstage (chief among them rough sex between Henry and Anne plus the Catholic Kings rupture with Rome) so many historical figures to squeeze in. (Thomas Cromwell and Jane Seymour pop up out of nowhere.) After covering much of its ground at a stylish canter ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" finishes at a plod. Romulus My Father Theres no lightening up the title character played by Eric Bana in ""Romulus My Father."" Nor is there any need to do so in this strong if occasionally ponderous drama that makes few gestures toward levity. Dark passions threaten to overwhelm Romulus Gaita a Yugoslav immigrant who has come to Australia in 1960 with his lovely German wife Christina and their young son Raimond. Christina whos alarmingly unstable suffers from a failure to thrive. She cant find her place in the vastness of her adopted land and runs off with her husbands best friend. Romulus for his part struggles with rage and chronic depression as he tries to give his boy a good life. ENLARGE Kodi Smit-McPhee and Eric Bana in Romulus My Father. The boys story gives the film its form. ""Romulus My Father"" a debut feature directed by the Australian actor Richard Roxburgh is based on a memoir by Raimond Gaita who thrived despite it all; young Rai grew up to be an author and professor of philosophy. Perhaps that memoir the celebrated work of a living author limited the possibilities for Nick Drake who did the screen adaptation. In a movie meant to entertain the character of the wife might have been more varied and interesting. (I know its unfair but Im thinking of Jessica Langes great Oscar-winning performance as the extravagantly unhinged military wife in ""Blue Sky."") The pace ranges from unhurried to slow; depending on how you see it thats the Australian filmmaking disease or distinction. Still the film succeeds on the strength of the boy and the remarkable young actor who plays him Kodi Smit-McPhee. Rai has a gift for happiness; thats the only explanation for his stability in the midst of confusion for his ability to cut loose from his doomed mother while taking what love his father can give him. As for Romulus hes a hard case but Eric Bana plays him with such gravity that he becomes a formidable presence. And the darkness of the story is counterbalanced by some of the most radiantly beautiful cinematography Ive seen in a long time. Its the work of Geoffrey Simpson and enhanced by meticulous color timing; its equally rare to see such consistent visual quality on a screen. Every shot is a composition striking but never static every sequence seems to be brushed with a new flavor of light to sweeten the shadows. See a clip from the movie ""Penelope."" Courtesy of Stone Village Pictures. Penelope Penelope"" tells the perfectly -- well imperfectly -- inane tale of a snouty young woman from a snooty family. At least were told she was born with a pigs snout thanks to a family curse. When we see the real heroine played gamely but lamely by Christina Ricci she simply looks like a cute kid with a Miss Piggy nose; rhinoplasty has produced worse in the name of enhancement. The movies real curse is a slender notion that went undeveloped or may have been undevelopable unless you count the climax which flows from a treacle bath of self-esteem. Catherine OHara is Penelopes mother ever desperate to find her daughter a blue-blood suitor. James McAvoy may or may not be Prince Charming. The decor is as charming as can be though it cant be the movies salvation. ""Babe"" had great decor but it also had Babe. ""Penelope"" was in a trough of trouble before the oink on the script was dry. ENLARGE Morgensterns DVD Tip ""The Private Life Of Henry VIII"" (1933) Charles Laughton won an Oscar for his capacious characterization of a gluttonous monarch in ""The Private Life Of Henry VIII."" Alexander Korda directed a large cast that included Merle Oberon as Anne Boleyn Wendy Barrie as Jane Seymour and Elsa Lanchester as Anne of Cleves. Most Netflix customers seem unimpressed in their online comments but one of them sees Laughton as a 1930s Jack Black. Hows that for cutting royalty down to size?

"Other Boleyn Girl contrived script weak acting - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeOther Boleyn Girl contrived script weak actingWEAK SCRIPT RUINS BOLEYN GIRLBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 02/28/2008 053651 PM PSTUpdated 02/29/2008 082405 AM PSTClick photo to enlargeNatalie Portman portrays Anne Boleyn left and Scarlett Johansson portrays her sister Mary in ""The Other Boleyn Girl.""<<1>>Watching ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" I was reminded of a family story that my father used to tell. As a small boy he came upon one of his older sisters sitting alone in a room repeating the same paralyzing phrase over and over. ""Not my fault Alan did it."" He was Alan. And he didnt do it. Its the same sort of treachery that Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) is constantly pulling on her sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson) in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" the god-awful screen adaptation of Philippa Gregorys bestselling novel. One imagines Gregory sitting in a darkened room chanting ""Not my fault Peter Morgan did it."" And so he did - Morgan is the screenwriter - though there is plenty of evidence to suggest that he didnt contrive this Tudor twaddle without help. Only a year ago Morgan was polishing the sceptered knob of royals on two continents with an Oscar-nominated screenplay for ""The Queen"" and a critically praised adaptation of ""The Last King of Scotland."" But he has met his match in Henry VIII brought low by the royal hissy fits of the hussy Anne Boleyn. As Anne Portman attempts to transport her reign as Queen Padme Amidala of the planet Naboo in ""Star Wars"" to 16th century England. The only satisfying distinction between the two performances is that this time shes executed for it. Portman has been quite good in pictures such as ""Closer"" and ""Garden State."" But she can also be dreadful as shes been recently in ""Goyas Ghosts"" and ""Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium"" and as she is again here.Advertisement You can see her acting all over the place and while Johansson is more subdued as her sister shes not much better. The picture is directed by Justin Chadwick whose emergence from a well-deserved obscurity he is now ready to resume. Chadwick and Morgan have cooked up a potboiler the sort of thing that might have been fun to watch with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as the Boleyn sisters while Charles Laughton lasciviously eyed the backs of their necks as Henry. Instead we get Eric (""Hulk"") Bana flouncing around in red velvet his royal hopes for an heir to the throne extremely high his Y-chromosome count apparently very low. When his first wife delivers a stillborn son the king is fortunate enough to have among his courtiers Englands leading pimp the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey the star of ""Basic Instinct 2"" and ""The Reaping"" a bill of indictment to which one more unforgivable sin is now added). Norfolk is not only a pimp but brother-in-law to a rural pimp with a learners permit and a stable of daughters - Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance). Norfolk and Sir Thomas conspire to exploit the queens spotty record birthing babies and replace her with a mistress they control Anne. But before Anne can assume the royal position VIII gets an eyeful of Mary and decides Norfolk has procured the wrong Boleyn girl. This is slightly inconvenient because Mary is a recent newlywed but only slightly. Hubby quickly signs onto the pimp apprenticeship program that evidently is the mark of manhood in the Boleyn family. All of this requires the forbearance of tedious plot details and historical exposition before we ever get to know much about the characters principally the sisters. Morgans script dishes up melodrama instead of the sort of tart intelligent power struggles weve come to expect from him. The roistering of this particular royal has been treated with far greater panache in the Showtime series ""The Tudors."" Henrys fracas with the pope over the dissolution of his first marriage is recounted with little or no mention of Sir Thomas More. Having had his day in a little thing called ""A Man For All Seasons"" - perhaps youve heard of it? won six Oscars including best picture in 1967? - he seems to have been banished from this far frothier version of events. Not his fault ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" did it.

Starring Natalie Portman Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana. Directed by Justin Chadwick. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its probably a safe bet that ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" wont be getting too many raves simply because its so easy to mock. Even if you enjoy it theres a tendency to look back on the experience with some sardonic distance and think of it as a modern soap opera with Elizabethan trappings. The movie has only a casual relationship with historical reality and gets lots of the details wrong including the fact that Henry VIII looked a lot more like Charles Laughton than Eric Bana. Yet however embarrassed you might feel in the morning this in an enjoyable movie with an entertaining angle on a hard-to-resist period of history. There are two pretty sisters and by the end one is going to have her head chopped off. Theres power manipulation maneuvering sexual exploitation and a king (Bana) whose notion of seduction is to go up to a woman and say ""Tonight."" (Thats it just ""tonight."") Also worth noting are some genuinely interesting takes on historical figures including Henrys first wife Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) who in most movies is treated like an austere fanatic. Here shes presented as an attractive woman of unmistakable integrity who knows she is about to get the shaft. The film pairs Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman as sisters with each getting to play against her usual casting. The normally knowing Johansson is the doe-eyed Mary Boleyn who goes through life just trying to mind her own business. And the normally straightforward Portman is her scheming sister Anne who is probably the smartest person in the movie but intelligence and a weak hand wont win many card games. Portmans performance which shows a range and depth unlike anything shes done before is the No. 1 element that tips ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" in the direction of a recommendation. Yet at least grudging acknowledgment must also be made of the arresting appeal built into the storys design. Based on Philippa Gregorys novel the film invites viewers to witness one of historys great train wrecks in slow motion from the standpoint of someone who had a seat in the front car. Perhaps some people might lose interest once Henry starts nosing around the Boleyn girls but those are probably the same good people who could stop watching 10 seconds into the Zapruder film. For most of us the spectacle of disaster is just too compelling to look away. The fun starts when Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) an ambitious wannabe who has married into a prominent family gets a great idea about how to advance his wealth and standing He will have his daughter Anne become mistress to the (married) king of England. Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") who wrote the screenplay emphasizes the drama and the immorality of such a scheme thus making us tangibly aware of the skewed nature of Henrys whole circle. That a father could do such a thing to his daughter - and that a daughter could cooperate in the reasonable belief that shes advancing her own interests - tells us all we need to know about this alien time and place. But Henry screws up Mr. Boleyns plans. Hes not attracted at least not at first to smart-mouthed Anne. He takes a liking instead to the gentle and newly married Mary who has no choice but to show up in his bedchamber at the appointed hour. This is what Mel Brooks was talking about when he said its good to be the king but here its not bad to be the mistress either. Like she does everything Mary stumbles into the situation passively and willingly with her eyes glazed and her mouth half-open. Johansson is not at her best playing women less shrewd than herself but by emphasizing Marys goodness instead of her naivete she finds a way to a performance thats proficient and affecting. The acting laurels however belong to Portman who wont get the credit she deserves for this simply because the movie isnt substantial enough to warrant proper attention. But she certainly goes on a journey in this film from youthful confidence to jaded spitefulness to absolute shrieking panic. She has one of her best scenes ever in the moments following Annes delivery of a daughter the child whod become Elizabeth I. No actor can ""play"" two things at once. Actors can only experience two things simultaneously and let the camera record it. In the childbirth scene its a near calamity for Anne that the child is a girl - and yet this is her baby and she has just given birth. Portman gives us all of that at once an Anne who is both mother and politician human being and monster. Mainly we see that shes just a young woman who has gotten in way way over her head. -- Advisory Sexual situations and sex talk.

In this unsexy and not particularly good-looking adaptation of a historical potboiler by Philippa Gregory Henry (Eric Bana) is alternately bewitched by sisters Anne and Mary Boleyn who are being pimped out as potential mistresses by their ambitious father (Mark Rylance) and uncle (David Morrissey). Henry is still married to his first wife (and his brothers widow) the Spanish Catherine of Aragon (the very good Ana Torrent) who is having difficulty producing a male heir. Meanwhile Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) fails her first mistress interview by showing up Henry with her riding skills (which strangely takes place off-screen). The king prefers Annes less headstrong younger sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson). With the enthusiastic consent of Marys husband and father - and the disapproval of her mother (Kristin Scott-Thomas) - Mary is installed as the kings mistress du jour and the queens lady-in-waiting while Anne is exiled to France and the rest of the family gets rich. But Henry becomes bored after Mary becomes pregnant with his child - the future Queen Elizabeth I - and dad sends for Anne to fill in which doesnt do a whole lot for the sisters relationship. The fickle Henry becomes instantly infatuated with Anne who in this version wont sleep with the king until he divorces Catherine banishes Mary and breaks with the Roman Catholic Church. This soap opera includes many risible plot twists most notably the newly enthroned Anne trying to sleep with her possibly gay brother (Jim Sturgess) to cover up a royal miscarriage - an act that lands both of their heads on the chopping block. Its all remarkably superficial bordering on silly despite a script by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") and direction by Justin Chadwick making his feature debut after helming the acclaimed TV adaptation of ""Bleak House."" Among other problems neither Johansson (who will unfortunately be portraying Elizabeth Is cousin in ""Mary Queen of Scots"") nor Portman are especially convincing as 16th-century Brits (who each throw many hissy fits) in ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" As for Bana (the Australian star of ""The Hulk"") the sexy Henry of TVs ""The Tudors"" Jonathan Rhys Meyers can rest easy on his throne. THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL Off with their heads. Running time 115 minutes. Rated PG- 13 (sex violence).

BY Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday February 28 2008 910 PM THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL. Historical drama about sisters vying for King Henry VIII. With Scarlett Johansson Natalie Portman. Director Justin Chadwick (155). PG-13 Sexuality violence. At area theaters.Pity Anne Boleyn. A powerful figure who altered the course of English history she wound up on the executioners block for her troubles. And five centuries later ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" digs up the dirt buries the truth and cheerfully watches the queens head roll once more.Director Justin Chadwick isnt entirely to blame for this heavy-breathing bodice ripper. He and screenwriter Peter Morgan have adapted Philippa Gregorys equally inaccurate novel in which Anne has all the character of your average ""Survivor"" schemer. As they tell it Anne (Natalie Portman) and her sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson) are pawns of their father (Mark Rylance) and uncle (David Morrissey). Desperate for social advancement the men coldly offer both beauties to King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) who immediately takes the bait. Innocent Mary is the first to find favor and she bears the king a son while falling genuinely in love with him. But conniving Anne who is furious at her sisters success soon takes center stage. A stay in France has taught her the art of manipulation and she shrewdly refuses Henrys advances. In short order he has ditched Mary exiled his aging queen (Ana Torrent) and established his own church just so he can marry Anne. Of course we all know how well things worked out for her from there. Chadwick builds a brisk pace and sweeping scope that initially grab our interest. But this Annes sole motivations are sex and greed and the wild rumors that were designed to destroy her are treated here as gospel. By the time she seduces her brother the movie has reached such a pitch of neurotic hysteria you cant help but laugh. The movie looks gorgeous and Johansson and Portman do their best to infuse rigidly defined roles with some complexity. A bland Bana however leaves us wondering why they even bother fighting over him. As the girls mother Kristin Scott Thomas is basically reduced to shaking her head sighing and wondering how things turned out so badly. Indeed.

Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johannsson star as sisters Anne and Mary Boleyn in The Other Boleyn Girl. Photo Focus Features The Other Boleyn Girl 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Remember when Henry VIII was ugly? You neednt be 500 years old to recall a zaftig Charles Laughton in The Private Life of Henry VIII - or the plump pink cheeks and weaselly eyes that stare with boredom from those 16th-century oil paintings. Judging from most earlier portrayals the guy wasnt exactly a looker. But all hail revisionist history. First Showtime offered up Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Hot Lips Henry in Showtimes The Tudors; now we get The Other Boleyn Girl in which the serial decapitator is played by Eric Bana as a tender and virile lover manipulated by a conniving little snot into ditching Katherine of Aragon and breaking from Rome. Bana is man enough to wear crinkly A-line dresses and fur collars without looking like a boob and hes actor enough to handle lines like ""Damn you I have torn this country apart For you without exactly sounding like one. He is not the problem. The problem lies in the movies boiled-over cliches and suffocating claustrophobia. I am not opposed to fictionalizing fact. And I am certainly not opposed to youthful and/or studmuffinny interpretations of unattractive historical figures though its worth noting that a previous adaptation of Philippa Gregorys novel - aired on British television a few years back - offered a much-less-doable Henry. But director Justin Chadwick (Masterpiece Theatre Bleak House) and screenwriter Peter Morgan (who also wrote the micro-series Henry VIII) downplay the skankiness of the king and his reign emphasizing instead the gossipy theatrics behind one familys quest for power and influence. Some of this is historically echt Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) did repel Henrys first efforts to bed her before she became wife No. 2. Some of it isnt Annes sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson) was probably not the dewy innocent portrayed on film but an ex-concubine to the King of France when she returned to England married Sir William Carey and started her slap-and-tickle with Henry VIII. These changes wouldnt matter a whit were the drama air-tight rather than airless but too much of it hangs on soap-operatic machinations in shadowy chambers. Its unusually stagy for a period film cramping a fine assemblage of actors into tight low-light huddles of erotic and political coupling. At first all the courtly melodrama offers its Lion in Winter diversions - but the writing too often decays to bromides and by the end the whole thing feels like a slow leak. Its been deprived of oxygen. Rounding out the cast are Mark Rylance as Anne and Marys father Sir Thomas Boleyn and Kristin Scott Thomas as the mum who pleads against debased ambition while her husband pimps out their daughters for status. Basic Instinct 2s David Morrissey brings unflappable scumminess to his role as Thomass brother the scheming Duke of Norfolk and Jim Sturgess (Jude from Across the Universe) brings mop-topped waffling to a slim bit as the girls brother George. As the proud besieged Katherine Ana Torrent maintains her queenly dignity while king and courtesans implode around her. Johansson is natural and sympathetic as Mary - but Portman playing nasty to Johanssons sweet relies on artless and flirty gestures to broadcast coquetry or intensity or fear. I suspect she was given bad direction. I also suspect Chadwick told her and Bana to chest-heave with frustrated desire at a doorway scene in the movies latter half ""Now I beg of you leave me Pant pant. ""Leave me The films seduction is all too obvious to ravish anyone especially viewers whove read a paragraph or two on Henry VIII and recollect what happened to his wives. ""Only God knows how anything will end opines Sir Thomas but movie goers have a pretty good idea.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The world awaits the resourceful art house or Turner Classic Movies programmer who strings together films that tell the story of British history through its royals. There would be ""Mrs. Brown"" with Judi Dench as Victoria. There would also be Derek Jarmans ""Edward II"" a movie that helped usher in the ""new queer cinema"" of the early 90s; Kenneth Branaghs ""Henry V""; perhaps even Al Pacinos docu-homage to Shakespeare and Richard III ""Looking for Richard."" Certainly ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" starring Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson as the sisters Boleyn would fit into this monarchy marathon. RATING | Historical Drama This story of sibling rivalry and sisterly connection in the court of Henry VIII would precede ""Elizabeth"" and its less golden sequel. Directed by Brit television director Justin Chadwick this is a less gripping foray into the territory of Showtimes highfalutin historical soap ""The Tudors."" Based on Philippa Gregorys historical novel the movie trades on something of a casting switcheroo. Portman who manages a girlish vulnerability even in an action flick like ""V for Vendetta"" is the calculating bold Anne. The chillier Johansson has yet to find the perfect material. Here she strikes the pose that brought her to the fore in the first place. As in ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" her Mary is an intelligent innocent navigating a new world. David Morrissey is impressively disagreeable as the Duke of Norfolk the Boleyns uncle and chief puppetmaster of the familys fortunes and misfortunes. It is he and father Thomas Boleyn (Mark Fylance) who use the Boleyn children (even son George) as political currency. The ""other"" of the title fits each sister depending on her relation to Henry. Initially it refers to the darker sister as when Anne celebrates the youngers nuptials. ""I am eclipsed"" she says seeing Mary aglow and dressed to wed for love (Benedict Cumberbatch as luckless William Carey). Other times it is Mary. Tossed on his rear in a hunting foray that puts Anne in a dark light Henry awakens to the light- haired Mary ministering to him. Once he forces the quieter younger sister to court from countryside he finds soul mate and friend. His passion is mercurial. When Anne returns from France charged with keeping him interested in Mary who convalesces during a pregnancy her boldness has been refined in the French court. She has become his match and she torments him with that fact till he divorces his wife and changes the course of Eng land and world religion. Peter Morgan adapted Gregorys novel. And its easy to recognize why the writer of ""The Queen"" was drawn to these sisters their ambitious family machinations and the complex character of Henry. Unfortunately that nuance doesnt find its way onscreen. Neither Johansson nor Portman convince. Instead of providing a quality setting for their talents director Chadwick uncovers their limitations. It is not until the bitter end that they appear at all connected to each other. Glimpses of depth come from Eric Bana as Henry and Kristin Scott Thomas as the Lady Elizabeth Boleyn. Not as petulant or supercharged as Jonathan Rhys Meyers Tudor on the Showtime series Bana still captures the mood of a man of appetites but also intellect. One of the finest moments comes from neither Boleyn girl but from Ana Torrent as Queen Katherine of Aragon. Shes no ingenue. Shes no patsy either. When she warns Henry hes fallen under Annes spell her understanding of her husbands weaknesses but also his strengths is real and regal. Ambition erotic energy and world history are more than enough reason to return to the monarchs of yore it seems. Still one wonders if filmmakers have it right Will we forever be enamored with Britains royal pains?

It doesnt end happily. By Peter rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 29 2008 Save for later Saved Overshadowed Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman l.) competes with her sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson r.) for the affections of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) in The Other Boleyn Girl. Courtesy of Alex Bailey/Columbia Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you are one of those people who thinks ""they dont make movies like they used to"" ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" should put your gripes on hold. A richly appointed period piece it features kingly tantrums mistresses bodices roaring fireplaces incest and mutton. It also features sharply enunciated period-perfect dialogue in which nary a contraction can be heard.All of which is entertaining even if the antiquity on view is somewhat forced and the performances labored. In truth they dont make movies like they used to but ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a reasonable facsimile.Based on the bestseller by Philippa Gregory and directed by Justin Chadwick from a screenplay by Peter (""The Queen"") Morgan this is a movie that relishes court intrigue. The focus is on two sisters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) who are manipulated into the good graces - and the bed - of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Chief manipulators are their country squire father Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) and their scheming uncle the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) but Anne at least doesnt need lessons in intrigue from anyone. Shes a vixen and a vamp and no doubt would be equally at home in a Raymond Chandler noir as in a Tudor palace. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The court intrigue of The Other Boleyn Girl fails to court intrigue Theres been lots written about Anne but not much is in the historical record about Mary and so the film is in a sense a fantasy about what she might have been like.Morgan taking his cue from Gregory presents Mary as a simple good-hearted country girl who summoned to the kings court along with her family for the express purpose of becoming his mistress falls in love with the guy. She produces a male heir but oops - shes not the Queen of England so the baby is illegitimate.Not wishing to make the same mistake Anne works her wiles on the bearded potentate pushing him to renounce his Queen and anoint her instead. Mary is saddened by her sisters plan. ""Why this cruelty? You know I love him"" she protests but meekly.Everything about Mary is meek. Whats missing from this characterization is any notion that her maidenly wholesomeness might be a ploy to get what she wants. Johansson is lovely in the role but theres something inert about the way the role is conceived - shes all too obviously the yin to Annes yang.And Portman overdoes the villainess routine. I realize were supposed to think King Henry is blinded by love or lust but really now - the most powerful man in the world cant figure out hes being played by a two-bit temptress? (On second thought I guess history offers ample precedent for this sort of thing. Never mind.)The subtext to ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is that the women of this era high and low were chattel. The sisters are essentially pimped by their elders with only their grim-faced mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) to protest - meekly.In such a world Annes machinations at least offer up a kind of poetic justice. The movie seems to be saying Whats a girl to do? Answer Anything.And so Anne becomes a kind of heroine - shes the best of the worst. Mary meantime is a generic female icon a nurturer who prefers the simple life and stands by her sister even when shes been wronged by her.Blood ties are big in ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" So is blood. In this kings court adultery is a very large no-no. Lose your head and you lose your head.Morgans dialogue and the lush high-definition visuals based on the paintings of Hans Holbein lead one to believe that ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" will be classier than in fact it is. Its more like a lushly produced catfight. This has its pleasures to be sure but for it to really take off youd need cats with sharper claws than these actresses possess. Grade B Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements sexual content and some violent images.

Comments The Other Boleyn Girl This drama about Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) and her sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson) being groomed essentially as prostitutes to service Henry VIII (Eric Bana) might have qualified as some sort of bodice ripper/history lesson. But despite a certain amount of moral outrage and good performances from the lead actresses its neither sexy enough to qualify as good trash nor serious enough to pass for history. (For starters according to many sources the real Mary was older than Anne not younger and far more promiscuous than she is here.) At least the script adapted by Peter Morgan (The Queen) from a Philippa Gregory novel explains how the Church of England came into being. The competent but stiff direction is by Justin Chadwick; with David Morrissey and Kristin Scott Thomas. PG-13 115 min.

(alex bailey) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / February 29 2008 ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is the kind of potted historical drama thats not good enough to take seriously and sadly not bad enough to be any fun. Its handsome heavy-breathing and silly - British royal history with the DNA of a ""Gossip Girl"" episode.The films also the latest in the Tudor-chic cottage industry all those Elizabeths on film and TV ""The Tudors"" ripsnorting away on Showtime and of course Philippa Gregorys popular novels of which 2002s ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" was the first. (She has since written five more cranking them out like ""authentic"" period sausage.)The attractions as ever are the outsized palace personalities here a young rapscallious Henry VIII (Eric Bana miscast) torn between two warring Boleyn sisters mouseburger Mary (Scarlett Johansson) and man-eater Anne (Natalie Portman). Both are his mistresses but only one is holding out for a crown. Whats a king to do? Apparently everything but run the country.Directed by Justin Chadwick with a screenplay adapted by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") on one of his lesser days ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" shows Henry initially lusting for the older Anne then falling for the warmer younger Mary then switching course one or two more times. And you thought you and your siblings had issues.Whoever the king wants is fine by the girls hapless father Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) and their uncle the scheming Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey). A Boleyn mistress they figure may result in a Boleyn heir on the throne since Henrys Number 1 Queen Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent once the child star of 1976s ""Cria"") has hit menopause with only Bloody Mary to show for it.Theres the germ of a serious idea here the ruthlessness with which women throughout history have been used by ambitious men as tools for advancement and their helplessness to do anything about it. Sir Thomas is quite happy to pimp his daughters to Henry even the married Mary (her spineless husband is played by Benedict Cumberbatch the perv in ""Atonement""). The girls mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) can only snarl impotently.""The Other Boleyn Girl"" though is a soap opera set at Hampton Court with an Australian and two Americans playacting British nobility. That might work if there were some subversive snap to the filmmaking but Morgans dialogue wheezes (""I find you much changed Mistress Anne"" - stuff like that) and Chadwick directs with dogged faithfulness to cliche. Whenever the movie switches to a new location we get a shot of someone riding riding across the downs. I kept waiting for one of the Monty Python boys to step out from behind a shrub and clop a pair of coconut shells together.Johansson mostly furrows her brow as the docile dumber Boleyn girl and Bana invites hoots as a sensitive New Age Henry. Portman gets to break out the Big Acting though and shes good company as she stamps her foot and careens from saucy to penitent to vengeful to callous to desperate. Thats already five more emotions than Queen Amidala got to show and she kept her head.You know the story. Anne nags Henry into starting the English Reformation already so he can get a divorce and make her Queen Number 2; she presents him with a daughter (who will grow up to be Cate Blanchett) before falling afoul of court intrigues and rumor the worst presented here as near-fact in the movies most chowderheaded subplot.The rest is hokum The historical Mary Boleyn was probably much older than her sister not the other way around and their liaisons with the king took place years apart (its also highly doubtful Marys son was Henrys). I know the genres called historical fiction but a movie this insipid isnt worth running to the Internet to figure out what actually happened. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" aspires to royal-purple drama but its a waterlogged paperback romance at best.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 28 2008 553 PM All the Kings Women The Other Boleyn Girl is a costume drama with lots of brocade and sadly little booty. By Dana Stevens Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson in The Other Boleyn Girl If MSNBCs David Shuster is shocked at the Clintons ""pimping out"" of Chelsea on the campaign trail he should get a load of what Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) does to his daughters in Justin Chadwicks The Other Boleyn Girl (Sony Pictures). In the name of consolidating their familys wealth and power these comely sisters are asked to do a lot more than address college crowds and munch on corn dogs at state fairs. Theyre offered up as frank sexual chattel heir-producing pawns in the court of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana). Henrys first wife Catherine of Aragon (great Spanish actress Ana Torrent) has been unable to bear him a son and as one player in the privacy-free zone of the court puts it ""she no longer bleeds."" So Henry--a charming sexually insatiable egotist--is on the lookout for fertile young flesh that the ambitious Boleyns are only too happy to provide. First the kings eye is caught by the saucy quick-witted Anne (Natalie Portman). But before she makes it to his royal bedchamber hes distracted by the gentle already married Mary (Scarlett Johansson). All three are placed in tableaux rather than being called upon to act but Johanssons performance stands out--her combination of vulnerability and blankness at times recalls Kim Novak. What follows is an entire miniseries worth of betrayals and reconciliations seductions births and miscarriages. While the broad historic outlines of the story are accurate--Mary Boleyn did bear two children generally believed to be Henrys Henry did break with the church of Rome to marry Anne and Anne was eventually beheaded on trumped-up charges of treason and incest--most of the behind-the-scenes intrigue and all of the sororal psychodrama is pure feverish speculation. Advertisement Based on the best-selling British romance novel by Philippa Gregory the movie was scripted by Peter Morgan who wrote The Queen The Last King of Scotland and the recent Tony-nominated play Frost/Nixon. For all of its cock-teasing camp (""How do you propose to stay on the horse?"" the king asks a sidesaddle-riding Anne; ""With my thighs"" she replies) the screenplay demonstrates flashes of a keen political intelligence. It gets something right about the built-in weaknesses of monarchy As patriarchal as this form of government may be its survival depends on the reproductive capacity of women (and their crucial but unverifiable fidelity to the king). In its pulpy soft-focused way The Other Boleyn Girl is almost feminist showing how the matter-of-fact royal traffic in women grinds down the sisters and their horrified but powerless mother (Kristin Scott Thomas). But feminist subtext aside the movie is primarily an excuse for ogling some blue-chip actor-flesh. Portmans heart-shaped face Johanssons cushiony lips Banas furry sternum are all handsomely framed in high definition. The costume design is so lush and detailed it may inspire a mass-market trend for Tudor fashion. (I see a real future for Portmans take on the ghetto nameplate necklace a gold ""B"" suspended on a string of pearls.) I just wish that those costumes however stunning spent more time crumpled on boudoir floors. For a movie whose story hinges almost entirely on sex The Other Boleyn Girl is disappointingly demure with elliptical talk of ""improper intimacies"" and love scenes that cut away after the first kiss. In order to keep Henrys attention in bed Anne confesses to her sister at one point ""I have to resort to ever more degrading ..."" Ever more degrading what? In an attempt to preserve its PG-13 rating and presumably its preteen-girl audience the movie muffles its own raciest moments. The only sex scene we see enough of is the one we least want to--lets just say that despite Portman and Johanssons recent red-carpet kiss the incest subplot has nothing to do with hot girl-on-girl action. At least The Other Boleyn Girl is admirably direct about being what last years Elizabeth The Golden Age tried not to be a prurient historical potboiler. Where The Golden Age tried in vain to make politics sexy (a flowing-haired queen inspiring her troops for battle on the back of a white horse) this movie recognizes that more often just the reverse is true. Its sex that can become political the machinations of desire that can have repercussions in the affairs of state. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

That she persuaded Henry to break with the Vatican so he could divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry her. That by withholding her sexual favors she won the crown. And that by not delivering Henry a male heir she lost her head. Of that other Boleyn girl Mary Annes sister less is known. Most historians agree that she was Henrys mistress and some say that she was likewise involved with the French monarch Francois I. Lack of available facts makes it easier to reclaim Mary as a heroine who owns her own sexuality and her own heart. The Other Boleyn Girl based on the historical fiction by Philippa Gregory stars Natalie Portman as that minx Anne who enchants and entraps Henry (Eric Bana) and Scarlett Johansson as that voluptuary Mary who simply loves him. In adapting Gregorys bodice-ripper screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen) recasts the age-old female archetypes of virgin and whore into post-feminist archetypes of tightly wound schemer and easygoing dreamer. Not that Im complaining exactly. Outside of The First Wives Club and porn movies its so rare to see plural females on screen that Portman and Johansson may be forgiven for seizing their roles as lapsed vegans might lamb chops. Both deliver memorable performances. As do Kristin Scott Thomas as the Boleyns mother beautiful as she is eloquent and Ana Torrent magisterial and magnificent as the discarded Catherine of Aragon. Still despite the lushness of the landscapes the leading ladies and their voluminous jewel-toned gowns The Other Boleyn Girl feels less like an epic drama about power and the power of love than an episode of a Masterpiece Theatre mini-series. Given the zing and zip of Morgans prior work its fair to guess that the films want of rhythm and sweep is due to Justin Chadwicks pedestrian direction. His shot sequence is this Face-off followed by heels clacking down the royal corridor followed by aggrieved character galloping off astride his/her horse. In the hands of Chadwick (who has indeed directed episodes of Bleak House for Masterpiece Theatre) The Other Boleyn Girl frequently seems less like historical fiction than hysterical fiction. Scenes are milked not for their emotional texture but confrontational pow which gets exhausting. As Morgan frames the story the Boleyn sisters from youth are a study in contrasts. Dark-haired Anne is complicated and stormy; light-haired Mary simple and sunny. When they reach maturity the family plan is to pimp each of them to the noblest family possible. Their mothers brother the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) is weighing the available dukes and marquesses when it comes to his attention that the king may be in the market for a new consort. (As Henry Eric Bana is so recessive that he nearly disappears from the screen.) The stormy/sunny characterization of the Boleyns is carried forward with the inference that their respective sex lives were much like their dispositions. The lead actresses have fun with their parts flint-eyed Portman striking sparks and radiating heat and honey-haired Johansson flowing with sweetness and light. No offense intended to these most resourceful of actresses if I say that their cycle of sisterly supportiveness and betrayal suggests a Tudor Mean Girls. Is the takeaway message here that she who wields power ends unhappily and she who is pliant has the opposite fate? I havent read the novel but something tells me this is not Philippa Gregorys intention. The Other Boleyn Girl 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Justin Chadwick.

The saga of Henry VIII has always had a special contempo juiciness. Yes it happened 500 years ago but it hinges on the invention -- or at least the popularization -- of divorce a fact portrayed with indelible flair in such pop cultural touchstones as A Man for All Seasons and The Six Wives of Henry VIII. The latest incarnation of the saga The Other Boleyn Girl is a classy romantic cocktail distinguished by its tart yet breezy bite. It was written by Peter Morgan and here as in the two celebrated films he scripted in 2006 -- The Queen and The Last King of Scotland -- Morgan displays a breathless fascination with the lace-on-steel intricacies of power. He turns gossip into art or tries to. Early in The Other Boleyn Girl were asked to marvel at the unseemliness of the Boleyn men as they engineer a liaison at the familys country estate between their eldest eligible lass the dark-haired flirt Anne (Natalie Portman) and King Henry himself (Eric Bana) whose queen has failed over and over to provide him with a male heir. Its funny in a grand way to see a scandalous extramarital fling orchestrated with the pomp of a debutante ball. At the estate Henry has a hunting accident that results indirectly from Annes hubris. He returns in a huff to the royal court and the only way that the family can get back in his good graces is to offer up its other daughter the wholesome honey blond Mary (Scarlett Johansson). Which makes the whole sordid setup feel like a glorified act of pimping. The king takes to Mary -- to her curves and her amber waves of hair to her gentle supplicant nature. (Few actresses know how to submit with the parted-lip sensuality of Scarlett Johansson.) Thats how the Boleyns with an ambition that is literally naked open the door to power. Yet the quality that Morgan as a screenwriter is most drawn to is the power of persuasion -- the kind that intrigues with its duplicity that harvests bold choices from limited opportunities. Thus the agent of action the movie revolves around is Anne who after a brief exile to France returns ready to exert her influence in a way thats both cold and admirable ruthless yet nobly feminist. She will have the king after all but on her own terms. And shell make him think it was on his. The Other Boleyn Girl offers the pleasures you want and expect from a middlebrow royal-court soaper. The actors playing the scheming Boleyns flex their eyebrows on dastardly cue and the director Justin Chadwick shoots the castle interiors with a grandeur just primitive enough to make parlors barely distinguishable from tower prison cells. As Henry Eric Bana huge and mighty and bearded his eyes aglow wears his big square layers of decorative fabric with majestic physicality. Hes courtlier less infantile than the Henrys were used to until he gets to the bedroom where he treats women like legs of mutton -- as tasty treats to be devoured. A disenchanted fairy tale about what happens after its sister Cinderellas move to the castle The Other Boleyn Girl is crisply enjoyable its cynicism polished to a high sheen yet theres also something rigid and slightly locked-in about it. Morgans characters are a little too abstract this time. They manipulate engagingly yet they dont fully breathe. Adapting a novel by Philippa Gregory Morgan imposes a structure that is nearly always visible -- far more so than in his modern political dramas (like The Queen or the rise?of?Tony Blair teleplay The Deal) in which the psychology of the scheme is all. Henry after countless mistresses is supposed to finally fall hard for the one woman who will stand up to him. But the way the film presents it his latent swooning is just another piece in the puzzle. You dont quite buy it. What you do believe is the self-deluded treachery of Portmans Anne. Theres a bold new authority to the actress sensuality. She sparkles with deception daring to flaunt passion as well as ambition. Anne a woman ahead of her time isnt quite shrewd enough about her own time. Yet as she uses her wiles not merely to seduce the king but to render that seduction legitimate she fulfills herself and destroys herself making the world safe for social climbers everywhere.

Granted thats no easy feat even for Hollywood. But if you can manage it then The Other Boleyn Girl falls into place a lot more neatly. It probably shouldnt be the way in which high-school kids learn about Henry VIII and his court but its a fun movie. Then again how could it not be? The House of Tudor had a regular Peyton Place going on in the 1500s. Sex violence betrayal - today it would be a reality show. Real World London. As the film begins we see the Boleyn girls Anne and Mary playing in a field with their brother as their parents (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas) discuss which of the daughters is the best marrying material which tells you the say women had in this kind of thing. Soon theyre grown up with Mary (Johansson) preparing to marry and Anne (Portman) the older of the two seemingly enjoying a happy-enough life. Enter their scheming uncle the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) a comically ambitious sort who wants to set Mary up as Henrys consort. Henry (Eric Bana) is famously desperate for a male heir yet his wife Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) has no luck in producing one leaving the field open as it were for other women. Norfolk sets up a royal visit which goes poorly for Anne but accidentally well for Mary whom the king orders to court and of course his bed her husband notwithstanding. (Royal pick-up line Henry simply brushes past Mary at a crowded party and says ""Tonight."" Silver-tongued devil.) But despite initial happiness on both their parts (and a son besides) Henrys appetites are fleeting. Anne has married in haste and been banished to France at the behest of Norfolk. Yet when Henry tires of Mary Norfolk sees opportunity and brings a newly ambitious Anne back at which point she immediately attracts the kings notice. Mary meanwhile is packed off to the countryside. Yet Anne does something no other woman dares She rebuffs Henrys advances. Which of course drives him crazy with lust. Playing hard to get all that. Henry devotes himself to winning Anne over at the cost of his marriage his (and his countrys) religion practically his nation. If youve studied your English history you know how all this turns out. (For Anne three words Heads will roll.) Portman starts out slowly as Anne but as the character grows in ambition and power she has a grand time of it. Johansson is far more subdued rallying herself only occasionally to square off with Henry or Anne. Bana makes for an interesting Henry the classic example of the man never happy with what he has always wanting something else - particularly when he cant have it (though when youre king that list is short). Bana plays him as annoyed almost angry most of the time. Best of all is Morrissey having a ball as Norfolk so over-the-top villainous he might as well have a long black mustache to twirl; hed be tying damsels to railroad tracks if railroads had been invented yet. Its funny its too much but it sets a tone that despite the subject matter The Other Boleyn Girl isnt going to take itself too seriously. And its all the better for it.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Sisters Are Doing It for Themselves Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson survive their melodrama. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Alex Bailey/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Entertainment) If the phrase hadnt been so sullied in recent weeks Id say The Other Boleyn Girl is about an ambitious family that pimps out its daughters for the sake of power and prestigea characterization that in the sixteenth century under Henry VIII would have gotten you suspended from a gallows. Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) is the saucy flirt her sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson) the demure naif. At the instigation of her uncle and father Anne comes close to bewitching King Henry (Eric Bana) but makes the mistake of looking more proficient on a horse than he does. So its Mary (a newlywed) who becomes his mistress while Anne hatches a plot to flash her dark eyes at the goatish monarch and then refuse to put out. Driven half-mad by thwarted lust the king discards Mary rebuffs the papacy and forms a new religion to divorce Catherine of Aragonwho cannot bear him a male heir anyway so Henry can claim theres civic virtue in his vice. Annes triumph though is cruelly short-lived. Until the ascendency of Elizabeth I women of the English court are infinitely replaceable. Directed by Justin Chadwick from a script by Peter Morgan (The Queen) The Other Boleyn Girl is a brisk feminist melodrama that is historically speaking a load of wank. It has the feel of a game of telephone in which information is progressively mangled. The Boleyn sisters who in life werent close are in Philippa Gregorys best-selling tony bodice-ripper both subtle rivals and intimate co-conspirators. Morgan transforms them into opposites who sometimes cling fiercely to each other the promiscuous Mary a goody-good country girl with a demeanor thats vaguely Amish the thoughtful Anne a Scarlett OHara in brilliant green. As a soap opera the film offers none of the kinky pleasures of Showtimes The Tudors in which Jonathan Rhys Meyers emits the kind of twisted pansexual vibe (his specialty) that could conceivably upend an empire. The Other Boleyn Girl is all on the surface. BACKSTORY The scorching pairing of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson has been a nice late-winter gift for the pressthere was that bondage-flavored cover for W magazine and rumors of catfights on set (quickly and firmly denied by male lead Eric Bana). Two days after Valentines Day the fetching duo amped up the promotional tour with a steamy kiss on the red carpet at the Berlin Film Festival. For monarchy-minded gossip hounds the most delicious tidbit came at the London premiere when the two dewy Americans playing royalty shook hands with the real McCoys Prince Charles and Camilla the duchess of Cornwall. Its a resplendent surface though and the lines have a satisfying snap. As he proved in his portraits of Elizabeth II Tony Blair and Frost and Nixon Morgan understands the distinction between public and private discourseand how in powerful figures the two modes bleed into each other with private whims setting public policy for centuries. Morgan and Chadwick keep the focus tight omitting Cardinal Wolsey Sir Thomas More and the devoutly religious Annes role in helping to conceive and sell the Reformation that would sever both Catholics from Protestants and her head from her shoulders. Details details. The Other Boleyn Girl skips from royal snub to royal snub miscarriage to miscarriage the Boleyns beginning and ending as pawns of arrogant males their power illusory their only solace their enduring sisterhood. And what of these young American actresses putting on British accents to vie for the English king (played by an Aussie)? They seem at first like enthusiastic coeds in a college production of The Importance of Being Earnest but once the dislocation fades their commitment wins you over. For starters theyre so gorgeous theyre museum-worthy. The cinematographer Kieran McGuigan uses candlelight to caress one side of the actresses faces while leaving the other in velvety darkness. When Henry studies Anne at prayer the downy hairs on the back of her neck have a glow thats first angelic and then devilishly alluring. Although her voice is untrained (it rasps when she pushes it) Portman gives The Other Boleyn Girl what it needs not just a queen but a drama queen. Scarlett Johansson is the revelation in part because the role is such a muddle of innocence and opportunism and dopey passivity. Johansson opens herself up to the camera and roots Marys improbable transitions in the characters impossible choices. With no evident strain with almost everything internalized Johansson keeps her head and makes you understand why Mary kept hers. A small child with a pacifier toddles unwatched into the waves while on a different continent an underage boy labors all day in an auto-body repair shop in a massive junkyard tucking himself in at night in a seedy room over the garage subsisting mostly on microwave popcorn Two films one American one Brazilian one slickly commercial the other raw and probing both set against a backdrop of extreme poverty and criminality both touching on violent inequality and the terrible impact of absent fathers. If you guessed the American film was the slick one guess again Ramin Bahranis Chop Shop is a low-budget verite triumph set in Queens beyond the sight of baseball fans in nearby Shea Stadium. Bahranis concentration is close to supernatural as he tracks the young prepubescent Ale (Alejandro Polanco) from job to soul-numbing job some legal some extralegal to the point where youre forced to suspend altogether your moral judgments and watch with a mixture of pain and awe. Working to survive and somehow save a few thousand dollars to buy a dilapidated truck from which the 16-year-old sister (Isamar Gonzales) who shares his little bed could sell food Ale lives in a world where fathers (including the One Upstairs) are nowhere in evidence.

Playing less fast and loose with history than Philippa Gregorys novel ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a sexy good-looking political bodice-ripper with an almost flawless cast at the top of its game. With a straight-arrow script by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") and smooth direction by Brit TV helmer Justin Chadwick (""Bleak House"") pic has the feel of an Old Hollywood studio costumer freshened up with contempo technique and acting styles. Tip-top cast led by Eric Bana and Scarlett Johansson as Henry VIII and Mary Boleyn could make this score beyond upscale auds with aggressive promotion and good reviews. Gregorys 2002 bestseller was previously made into a British telepic of the same title in 2003. Present item has none of the raggedy low-budget feel of that partly improvised work and scripter Morgan (who wrote the 2003 miniseries ""Henry VIII"") seems utterly at ease with the characters here. Morgan manages the difficult trick of making the narrative crystal-clear without dumbing down the actual material. By eliminating many of the more fanciful potboiler elements in Gregorys novel the script simplifies the tangled web of 16th-century Tudor court intrigues into a clean fast-moving yarn thats both highly cinematic and immediately engaging at a character level. After sketching the idyllic country childhood of sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn pic jumps straight to the marriage of the shy elder Mary (Johansson) to the son of a merchant family (Benedict Cumberbatch). For the much more knowing ambitious Anne (Natalie Portman) her father Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) has bigger plans to advance the familys standing despite the reservations of his wife Elizabeth (Kristin Scott Thomas). Urged on by his brother-in-law the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) and noting how Henry VIIIs current wife Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) has failed to produce a male heir Sir Thomas invites the king for a hunting visit and orders Anne to ""bewitch"" the monarch and become his mistress. Alas the plan backfires and Henry falls for Mary instead. Sir Thomas amp; Co. quickly switch to Plan B in which Mary takes Annes place with the endorsement of her milquetoast husband. Invited to the kings court as a lady-in-waiting Mary is frostily received by the dignified Catherine and accompanied by a pissed-off Anne. In a beautifully calibrated bedroom scene between Mary and Henry thats marbled with genuine tenderness and sexual frissons the two become lovers to the delight of Sir Thomas and Norfolk. In a tantrum Anne elopes with a nobody (Oliver Coleman) but is quickly packed off to France by her father to teach her a lesson. Swept along by a rich score by Paul Cantelon (""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"") and costumed by Derek Jarman/Neil Jordan alum Sandy Powell in fabric heavy on blues reds and golds pic sets a rich stage for the second half signaled by Annes return from temporary exile in Gaul. Confidently garbed in a dazzling green gown that immediately contrasts with the pics color scheme Anne teases taunts and flirts outrageously with Henry driving a wedge between him and her sister and prepping the narrative for a fast-moving final act of plot reversals and rolling heads. With the flashier role and some of the sharpest lines Portmans Anne dominates more of the early going than seems dramatically right for a movie whose title refers to the lesser-known sister. But at the end of the day Johanssons quieter Mary comes through as the pics emotional center her tender love story with the conflicted monarch evoking the only genuine feelings on display.Johanssons slow-burning perf is a model of restraint her Mary trying to make emotional sense of an environment in which marriage is simply a political and social commodity. Shes nicely contrasted by the sheer physical presence of Banas moody virile Henry wholl finally do anything -- even cut off England from the Catholic Church -- to produce a male heir. Though she has the lynx-like eyes and ambition down pat Portman doesnt quite bring the necessary heft to make Anne a truly dominant power player partly because she seems the least comfortable of the three non-Brit leads acting with acquired English accents. Rest of the cast is aces with Scott Thomas investing every syllable of her dialogue with extra resonance Morrissey a powerful dramatic presence as the villainous Norfolk and Rylance cleverly playing Sir Thomas scheming in an unexpectedly low key. Spanish thesp Torrent brings an impressive dignity to her few scenes to the tragically sidelined Catherine of Aragon. Historical locations in Blighty blend seamlessly with production designer John-Paul Kellys studio sets to create a convincing Tudor England.
