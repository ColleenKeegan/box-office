Pictures Image 8 of 8 42 review Big league entertainment 1 / 8 Back to Gallery 42 Drama. Starring Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford. Directed by Brian Helgeland. (PG-13. 115 minutes.) Jackie Robinsons story has been filmed several times before most notably in 1950 with Robinson playing himself. The story is not going away but will continue to be revisited every generation or so because its a great American story whose meaning continues to grow. But Brian Helgelands ""42"" should do the job for the next 20 or 30 years as this eras statement about Robinson and the breaking of baseballs color line. In 1950 the story was practically hot off the presses and immediacy is an advantage. But so is hindsight and so is the frankness of language allowable in a modern movie. As presented by Helgeland and played by Chadwick Boseman Robinson is a hero we can recognize not the most gentlemanly black athlete who ever lived but rather someone prickly and determined with a fierce sense of his own value and a carefully cultivated block of ice inside. Not a sweet guy but rather the one guy who could take it - and even he almost couldnt. Appealing as drama the movie is also an enticing trip back in time. The world of 1947 when Robinson became the first black player in major league baseball may have been a nightmare in terms of social justice but the fabric of the suits the gleam of the cars and even the old-fashioned fonts on the street signs make us want to linger there. Watching it is like inhabiting a late-40s Technicolor travel short. ""42"" - named after the number on Robinsons jersey - is beautiful just to look at it. Brooklyn Dodgers Robinson entered history through the Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey who decided to break the color line that had existed in professional baseball since the 1880s. Curiously it had never been official policy that baseball should be segregated but rather a long-held tradition considered inviolable. That Rickey chose to violate it makes him at least the second most interesting person in ""42."" Harrison Fords performance as Rickey is his best of recent years. Ford chooses to flat-out do Rickey to imitate his speech patterns and facial gestures and then having created that shell to inhabit it fully. Rickey is a complex figure a businessman who knows the money in black box office and the talent of black athletes; a social liberal harboring haunted memories of injustice; and above all a deeply sincere and practicing Methodist whose Christianity simply cannot abide racism. On the surface Ford gives us a cigar-chomping businessman from another time but look closer and you see a great man. Today we look back on the integration of baseball as an inevitability but a lot of it rode on Robinsons comportment and also on sheer luck. There are times in ""42"" when it seems that Robinson could easily have been murdered before he was called to the big leagues while he was in the South during spring training. Then under pressure that would make almost anyone snap Robinson had to perform. Being merely a good player wasnt enough. He had to be great. To maintain the concentration necessary to deliver in a sport where just a fraction of a second can be the difference between glory and humiliation is an awe-inspiring athletic and human achievement. The first season Most of ""42"" is about that first baseball season 1947 and what Robinson went through - isolation from his teammates and a relentless series of insults on and off the field. They may have been the Brooklyn Dodgers but a lot of them were from the Deep South and almost seven decades later with Barack Obama in the White House its revelatory the degree to which racism was tolerated in 1947. Much of the drama of the film is in watching Boseman as Robinson absorb abuse from every side and try to resist punching somebody. Toward the finish Helgeland cranks up the soundtrack and goes sentimental in ways even Steven Spielberg might think excessive and at times you feel the writer-director straining to impose a dramatic structure on historical events. The ending for example feels forced. Still as a dramatization of what Robinson did and what it required ""42"" will not disappoint. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

By Mary Pols MaryPolsApril 12 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle D. Stevens / Legendary Pictures Productions LLC / Warner Bros. Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Writer/director Brian Helgelands warmly inspirational 42 approaches the Jackie Robinson story as something glowing with as much promise as the youthful Robinson embodied in 1945 when Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey began seriously plotting to make him the player to break baseballs color barrier. Robinsons hardscrabble early life his abandonment by his father and brushes with racist and repressive authority figures are all hinted at in 42 but the movie continually pats us on the arm assuring us that Robinson (played by relative unknown Chadwick Boseman) shall overcome and with him America. ""All future now"" Rickey (Harrison Ford) says gazing at his recruit. ""No past."" 42s purpose is not to make us feel shame in our national shortcomings at least not primarily but pride in his triumph. Is there anything wrong with this? Robinsons widow Rachel worked closely with Helgeland on the film; so it has the familys endorsement. Its an easily engaging movie well acted lushly photographed. But some will likely label the movie too soft because of the way it so intently telegraphs through swelling instrumentals and a warm bath of lighting that things are going to improve for Jackie Robinson for his wife Rachel (played by Nicole Beharie from Shame) and his many admirers including Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) the sweet black journalist Rickey dispatches to keep an eye on Robinson. Robinson running out Brooklyns Ebbets Field on April 15 1947 wearing the number 42 on his Dodgers jersey was a key moment in the history of the long march toward racial equality. (If it gives you chills just thinking about it youll eat up how fantastic it looks on the big screen.) But a child walking out of 42 would be forgiven for thinking everything was settled after that season. That the jerks backed down and the beauty of a man named Jackie Robinson who danced between bases and always held his head high was enough to conquer all. To explain that the agonies and heartbreak of the Civil Rights Era still lay ahead would prick the happy balloon 42 sends into the air. Its a conversation starter then a perfectly respectable thing for a movie to be. Others will have quibbles with Fords Rickey portrayed as the classic savior figure the pure-hearted white man who enables a black man to get ahead. He functions much like The Helps Skeeter Phelan or The Blind Sides Leigh Anne Tuohy; there are moments when 42 threatens to become as much his story as Robinsons. This gnawed at me a nagging voice tugging at the pleasure of seeing Ford growling like an elderly pit bull guarding its bowl projecting more energy and enthusiasm than he has shown in a film since he was engaged in hand-to-hand combat on Air Force One some 15 years ago. Its a meaty cigar-chomping role the kind that usually goes to great character actors not a former hotty like Han Solo and Ford treats it like a gift unwrapping it with obvious delight. When shortstop ""Pee Wee"" Reese (Lucas Black) comes to Rickeys office and hands over a threatening letter hes received because of his willingness to play alongside Robinson Rickey goes over to a file cabinet and starts pulling out file folders fat with letters. Pee Wee asks what they are. ""Ill tell you what they arent"" Ford says starting with the growl and building up to a roar. ""Letters from the Jackie Robinson fan club"" Cue the next scene where Robinson takes the field in Cincinnati and is instantly abused by a stadium full of hostile white fans. As he stands there reeling from a fresh venue of hatred Reese now enlightened famously jogs over to stand next to number 42 and then puts a cautious arm around him (captured in a sculpture that stands outside the minor league ballpark in Coney Island). References are made to the Civil War and the Kentucky-born Reese makes a dopey remark about how close the South was to winning. To which Robinson shakes his head in disbelief and says something along the lines of better luck next time. ""There wont be a next time"" Reese says with surety. The movie gives us continual little satisfactions like this moments of resounding niceness to counter the hideousness of say the Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) repeatedly yelling the n-word at Robinson whenever hes at bat. Tudyk may be a lovely man in person but it seems the makeup artists and lightning technicians did their best to make his Ben Chapman look like a possum. His red-rimmed eyes are at half-mast and hes pale pudgy pasty--as unpleasant to look at as to hear. A quick Google search reveals that the real Chapman while no Han Solo was not quite as unappetizing as Helgelands film makes him out to be. Will this have an effect of affording the white audience a comforting distance from the things hes saying? Conversely theres a whitewashing affect in a sequence when the Dodgers training in Panama and aware that Rickey plans to bring Robinson in from the minors (the movie covers the time frame where Robinson left the Negro leagues to play with the Montreal Royals starting in the spring of 1946) begin to organize a strike of sorts. A small group writes up a petition saying they wont play if he does and goes from hotel room to hotel room trying to rally support. The players all looked so blandly alike with their neat short haircuts and white white skins that I had a hard time figuring out who was who--the racists all blend together--and found that later on as the Dodgers started emerging as characters I couldnt remember who I was supposed to revile and who didnt seem so bad; theyre off the hook somehow especially as they grow into a team. Theres a great shot of the Dodgers lined up at the beginning of a game the grey-white uniforms all blending into each other along with the white faces until near the end of the line the eye is called to Bosemans Robinson. Even well into the movie its a startling image showing just how alone Robinson was on that field even among so many men in the same uniform. The greatness of the man in real life lends an immediate gravity on any portrayal but Boseman doesnt need much help. Boseman is not a hugely close physical match to Robinson except for perhaps in the power he conveys but hes a great choice to play the ball player unfamiliar enough despite a decade of small credits here and there to feel like an athlete not a movie star playing one. (For such a famous man Robinson has rarely been a cinematic character. The 1950 movie The Jackie Robinson Story featured Robinson playing himself. Andre Braugher played him in a 1990 TV movie called The Court Martial of Jackie Robinson.) Its not easy to play a stoic but Boseman anchors the movie and when he smiles 42 already such a warm story of such cold times gets even brighter.

(Tellingly the first attempt in 1950 starred Robinson himself and still felt like a fantasy.) Writer-director Brian Helgeland has somehow found a way to do it cleanly and intelligently by sandwiching his movie between soft slices of sentiment but leaving room for a meaty interior that surprises with its rawness. ""Gentlemen I have a plan"" intones visionary Brooklyn Dodgers exec Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford doing an awful lot of acting) in the first half hour signing the bold shortstop (Chadwick Boseman) to his minor-league squad while warning him of the hell storm ahead. By movies end--the peak of Robinsons 1947 rookie season--were pounding toward home plate in slo-mo like The Natural. But before then 42 settles into an absorbingly complex battle of wills baseballs pageant suffused with an ugly strain of racism hooted from the stands and even the dugouts. One scene of prolonged hectoring--from disgraced Phillies coach Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk)--is breathtaking for a studio movie; Helgeland cuts to an innocent child echoing the worst habits of his dad. Robinson had to quietly win over his own teammates not all of whom saw an opportunity for nobility. As in the best sports films you also learn a lot about mechanics Robinsons aggressive style of play was itself seen as an affront and theres humor in Rickeys sly managerial tactics. The style of the film lush and traditional is nothing special (that Jay-Z song in the trailer was a fake out) but the takeaway a daily struggle for dignity is impossibly moving.

Well except for when he talks to his wife and infant son then writer-director Brian Helgelands script drives him into speechmaking about the interior life he is otherwise allowed to convey through expression and action. And sometimes through inaction as Dodgers owner Branch Rickey tells him success will require Robinson to be like Jesus and turn the other cheek. (Harrison Fords growly-jowly performance as Rickey does nothing to obscure an excellent character a man whose motivations include greed devotion to the game and a genuine strain of Christianity.)

"The Problem With Saints << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Loose Cannons  Next Full Metal Jackets Courtesy of Warner Bros. Facebook Twitter Print Movies The Problem With Saints On the lifeless Jackie Robinson biopic 42. Plus Danny Boyles twisty Trance. by Wesley Morris on April 11 2013 Whenever it is that an icon passes from being human to being a saint is the point at which its probably too late for a good movie. All you get is the lessons learned and very little of the naturalism or idiosyncrasy or personality that made the person iconic in the first place. Or you get all that courtesy of a great performance but then theres no filmmaking or storytelling to support it. You rarely get both acting and an angle the way you did say with Walk the Line and Lincoln. Its usually that the subjects mean so much to the filmmakers that they cant bring themselves to take the subjects out of their historical packaging and play with them lest they lose their value. Thats the Jackie Robinson situation. In 1950 Robinson played himself in The Jackie Robinson Story which was basically a hero giving a feel-good book report on himself. Hes been in bubble wrap ever since. But after turning down other movies including one Spike Lee and Denzel Washington wanted to make Robinsons widow Rachel finally said yes. So 66 years after Robinson became the first black major league baseball player here we are with 42 which has been made with such reverence for Robinsons importance that Robinson is barely there. Brian Helgeland (Payback A Knights Tale) wrote and directed this movie which concentrates on Robinsons debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers and sometime after the halfway point he lays out his angle. Its Robinsons (Chadwick Boseman) first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 and for each at-bat against the Phillies Philadelphia manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) leaves the dugout and proceeds to call him ""n--- "" the way youd call your dog into the house. Its a good scene that goes on long enough to leave a simmer in your blood. And after he pops up during his next-to-last at-bat with Chapman still going Robinson leaves the plate steps down into the tunnel beside the dugout howls out his rage smashes a bat and crumples to the ground. While hes crumpled Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) the Dodgers general manager who hired Robinson appears and proceeds to explain that his controversial hire cant get mad since thats what the bigots expect. Theres too much riding on his player for him to run out of cheeks to turn. (But Robinson already knows this. In one of his first scenes he calmly but tensely threatens to go elsewhere for gas after the white service station manager refuses to let him use the bathroom.) Rickeys pep talk puts Robinson in the movies thematic place. His function is only curative ""Youre medicine Jackie."" 42 is a Hollywood movie about American racism in which the objects of that racism must summon their most noble selves. Helgeland whos white doesnt imagine how it must have felt being slurred as relentlessly as Robinson was. So Robinson serves as a lesson not in triumph but in tolerance. This is the sort of movie in which Jackie and Rachel Robinson (Nicole Beharie) dont have to change. White America does. Thats great for messaging but hell on drama. All the changing here happens to the players and the management of the Dodgers organization. Helgeland skillfully writes around the problem of how white racism affects non-racist whites. And hes a smart sensitive-enough writer to make this an interesting worthy emotional pursuit. The players draft an anti-Robinson petition not long after his arrival and one by one find themselves changing their minds. Robinson was never a problem for Pee Wee Reese whom Lucas Black plays but when the Dodgers wind up in Cincinnati he shows Rickey a threatening letter someone wrote him and worries that his relatives in Kentucky will go bananas. Then Rickey shows Reese the pounds of hate mail that Robinson gets Reese goes out on the field puts his arm around his teammate and lets the crowd savor the image. Having an actor play Robinson makes sense for realism but most of the time a piece of cardboard with Robinsons likeness would have done the trick. Boseman has very little to do that makes Robinson a character. His best scenes are usually somewhere on the baseball field. The challenge in them for an actor is to find a way to combine Robinsons athleticism with his joy at being an athlete. He puts some cocky comedy into his base stealing and a little bit of sex into the performance. Beharie is a strong charismatic actor who needs a great role. (Here shes playing a great woman and thats not the same thing.) Most of the other black characters like the sports reporter Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) have nothing to them but their goodness. Smith is turned into a glorified butler for Robinson. And theres an embarrassing couple of scenes with a precious tyke who were told during the closing credits will grow up to be Ed Charles who played for the Mets and Athletics. He explains plays for his mother but is played by the kind of child actor who gives you cavities. Most of the funny and insightful stuff falls to actors like Christopher Meloni T.R. Knight Hamish Linklater Max Gail and even Tudyk. Ford meanwhile turns jowly and growly to play Rickey. He doesnt have the suffocating hardship of upholding a legacy because Helgeland has given him all the self-congratulatory stuff to play. Ford can get high and mighty with all the grandstanding he gets to do because Rickey here is right. Hes shamelessly entertaining in chewing everybody out and cheering everybody up. But by lifting up Ford and Rickey the movie makes Robinson beside the point. Its possible that Helgeland is thinking past the matter of racism altogether. A lot of 42 feels like an allegory for how things might go for that first openly gay guy in a major league locker room -- all the awkwardness about showering together and sharing rooms the complaints about not wanting to play with someone whos deemed different the way that after a season of prolonged exposure everyones tune changes and the outcast is embraced. But whether Helgeland is thinking about Jackie Robinson or his to-be-determined gay counterpart 42 ultimately doesnt feel like a sports drama as much as it does an epic commencement speech. One reason to love Danny Boyle is that well never have to put up with a Jackie Robinson movie from him. Or if it comes to that hell find an imaginative reason to do it. Last summer he had James Bond throw Queen Elizabeth out of a helicopter to open the Olympics. He gets off on his irreverence. Trance is high-order film noir nonsense that takes Boyle back to the thrillers he made at the start of his career with John Hodge (he wrote Trance too) like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting that were preoccupied with the grimy corners of the psyche. Boyles no longer a grimy filmmaker. He likes sleek icy images that seem launched from cannons and slingshots or pushed through syringes. Trance concerns an auction-house art heist that goes south when the jobs inside man an auctioneer named Simon (James McAvoy) takes a shot to the head that erases his memory of where he put the Goya painting he helped steal. The ringleader is a guy named Franck (Vincent Cassel) one of those elegant thugs who surrounds himself with a trio of goons that do the bone-breaking while he sips cognac or whatever. When its clear that Simon suffers from honest-to-goodness amnesia Franck lets him select a hypnotist to help him retrieve the memory. You suspect the movies up to no good because Rosario Dawson plays the shrink Simon picks. Theres no reason to ask us to believe Dawson as a medical professional unless she can turn that belief on its head. Eventually this woman talks her way into Francks criminal circle. She argues that Simon doesnt feel safe remembering where hes put the painting because he knows Franck and his friends will just kill him when he does. What ensues is group hypnosis some sex and two or three changeups that dont twist the plot so much as reroute and rewire the movie. This is Boyles first movie set entirely in London since 2003s 28 Days Later ...  and his affinity for affixing his camera to everything speaks to the citys reliance on closed-circuit surveillance. Hes working with the editor Jon Harris and his usual cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and they give the movie the exhilarating attention-deficit disorientation that Boyle has turned into a legible cinematic language. Symmetrical reflections in glass that turn into a living Rorschach a hypnosis head trip that requires use of an iPad to extend the trip the vaginal lattice of a highway overpass at night His eye is manic without ever descending into madness. Besides the script which Hodge wrote with the science fiction TV writer Joe Ahearne goes crazy enough. At some point you dont know whom to trust or whats real or why anybody is doing what theyre doing but McAvoy Dawson and Cassel work well together. Dawson is required to put her nude body to incoherent if not gratuitous use but shes also perfectly plausible when discussing the rare psychological state of extreme suggestibility. Even after the movie has gone off the deep end and into a moral pit youre not sure whether it makes any sense. By then Boyle has fried enough of our senses that Simons extreme suggestibility is contagious.

Harrison Ford has never given a bad performance in his life and this maybe one of his best ever Sooner or later you have to give thismn an Oscar Tim Mocarskisaid on Saturday April 13 2013 100349 AMI agree the film was good but I dont think Fords portrayal of Rickey was cartoonish. Rather I think its one of Fords best jobs in his profession and the scene where he explains to Robinson why he has done this is comparable to James Earl Jones explaining the people will come. This is not the greatest baseball film ever made but it does have its shining moments. POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

For more than three decades there has been clamoring for a major motion picture that honored the man and the milestone. For a spell sports freak and maverick director Spike Lee was attached to a Robinson pic project. (His first child is named after Satchel Paige for heavens sake.) So too was director Robert Redford star of ""The Natural"" (ranked No. 7 on an all-time best baseball flicks list by Baseball America). Its been a long time coming but writer-director Brian Helgelands ""42"" has arrived to give the hero and heroics a big-screen treatment worthy not just of the game-changer himself but also mindful of the major (and minor) acts of decency required to bring about social change. The film isnt a sweeping bio-pic and its better for it. Instead Helgeland focuses on the time right before and during Robinsons rookie season. Which doesnt mean its a modest outing. ""42"" is an old-fashioned movie swinging for the fences. It intends to stir our emotions and our belief in this nations better angels. Yes this is a sentimental journey. But its one definitely worth taking. It has an emotionally hued (at times too much so) score by Mark Isham. Don Burgess cinematography bestows a sturdy aura not just on the films central protagonists but also those ballfields of yore. ""42"" boasts a fine roster of actors doing the kind of utility-player duties that make a movie better. Lucas Black gives a sweet laconic turn as shortstop Pee Wee Reese. Alan Tudyk is chilling as Philadelphia Phillies foul-mouthed manager Ben Chapman. Andre Holland brings ballast to the role of Wendall Smith the savvy black sportswriter -- and future legend himself -- whom Dodgers owner Branch Rickey hires to chronicle Robinsons arrival to the show. ""Im your Boswell"" he tells the young slightly suspicious ball player. ""42"" also has a movie star giving one of his best star turns. Padded to look stout and calling on a croak of a voice Harrison Ford portrays Rickey who had the bold idea to break baseballs color barrier. When asked by the teams secretary (T.R. Knight) why Robinson -- why not say the Negro baseball leagues legendary pitcher Satchel Paige -- Rickey answers ""We need a player with a future not a past."" Most important and moving ""42"" has an inspired love story at its core with relative unknowns Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Beharie portraying and empowering the couple Jack and Rae. They have an extraordinary chemistry that offers a portrait of a special marriage. Theres a deep abiding romance to be had in a clear-eyed loving partnership. Rachel Robinson now 90 was a consultant on the film. After her husbands death in 1972 she founded the J ackie Robinson Foundation dedicated to assisting minority students seeking higher education. Its no surprise then that the opening salvo about the return of the ""greatest generation"" from the battlefields of WWII has the feel of a history lesson -- albeit an often nuanced and graceful one. Indeed this is a movie about a kind of racial parity. Helgeland and company aim for audiences to come together to experience our shared (ongoing) national saga of civil rights. A black mother takes her son to see Jackie play for the Dodgers minor league affiliate the Montreal Royals. The boy endures the slurs thrown at his hero from the segregated stands. A later pivotal scene finds the Dodgers playing the Reds in Cincinnati near Pee Wee Reeses old Kentucky home. In the span of seconds a white father goes from sweet chaperone to his excited son to frothing bigot. Its less heavy-handed than it sounds. Because Helgeland lets the kids face tell the conflicted story of his love for his father and his confusion about Reeses embrace of Robinson on the ball field. Much like the movies hero the civil rights movement was in its rookie season. What lies ahead would require even more fortitude from people whose names we never knew who didnt wear a number. Almost 15 years before Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his best-known speech on the Washington mall there was Jackie Robinson undeterred and unbowed by vitriolic racism ""I have a field of dreams."" Not quite but this story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nations history. Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 lkennedydenverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy ""42.""

He was that big of a man that much of a symbol that profound a change-agent ensconced in Dodger blue. In real life this iconic American tale encapsulated the tumult of race relations after World War 2 and how Americas desire for excellence eventually slowly won out over the fear of ""the other"". Unfortunately though we do indeed get a few of those amazing moments the film doesnt always reach the level of tremendous instead playing out as largely entertaining if also somewhat formulaic. ""42"" could have a been a true contender for the ""best baseball movie ever"" crown but it never quite grabs the mantle instead touching home plate as a solid if occasionally scattered biopic. In 1946 the world was changing attitudes and cultural perspectives were shifting and Jackie Robinson was the star of that show. He faced pure hatred from complete strangers the likes of which you wouldnt wish upon your worst enemy and he faced down a good old boy network that clung to unwritten rules and institutional discrimination. The owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) decided that money and winning were far more important than keeping baseball segregated but he needed a man who would be able to withstand the heaping amounts of abuse that were sure to pour down on the first African American ballplayer. Enter Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) a World War 2 veteran playing for the Kansas City Monarchs clearly talented but even more importantly possessing an emotional core that would not wilt under direct fire. Jackie Robinson was Branch Rickeys chose ambassador for his entire ethnicity the hopes of a brighter future pinned squarely upon his chest. ""42"" is the story of those first few seasons 1946 and 1947 and the journey The Dodgers Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson embarked upon. Strong performances from Chadwick Boseman (Robinson) and Harrison Ford (Rickey) carry the film through its 128-minute running time though the efforts of Lucas Black (as Pee Wee Reese) and Christopher Merloni (as manager Leo Durocher) must be lauded as well. What ""42"" does extremely well is set the tone of the time period where the majority of people in certain regions were heavily opposed to the idea of a non-white baseball player mightily invested in the all-white power structure of the era. The first guy through the door always takes the biggest wallop and ""42"" does well to show the constant trials Robinson faced in his quest for racial equality. Where ""42"" has a much tougher time is with character development editing and the overall unevenness of the transitions between scenes. Many of the Brooklyn Dodger players are given a few minutes of screen time but its difficult to say who is who and whether or not they are one of the impediments or supporters of Jackie Robinsons cause. In this case trying to make ""42"" about everyone left it wanting and needing more Jackie Robinson (along with more straightforward baseball scenes). Jackie Robinsons wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie) is also given her due credit which is an sum positive but there are moments where it feels perfunctory as opposed to in service of the story. A massive detriment to the film is T.R. Knights take on assistant Harold Parrott. Hes comically underused in the opening half of the film and then somehow relied upon to carry major arcs during the second act though we really have no idea about the context of the character. The script really stumbled in this area showing us a voiceless man for an hour and then pivoting him toward full-on supporting actor near the culmination of the film. There are some majestic moments woven into the fabric of ""42"" as well theres a scene between Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese thats as good as anything youll see this year. Additionally the announcer for the Dodgers Red Barber (John G. McGinley) is a constant delight with his understated old-timer phrasing any time hes providing commentary is extremely compelling. Sadly real life seems to have not provided much of a story arc for ""42"" to attach itself to but writer/director Brian Helgeland does his best to infuse tension where he can. The old ballparks the uniforms and the crowds are all lovingly rendered with an admirable authenticity and it is on the field that ""42"" clearly has the most momentum. To think back of the pressure Jackie Robinson must have faced with every interaction the reputation of an entire race however unfairly placed upon his broad shoulders is to recognize a modern day saint. One misstep one wrong move and Jackie would have single-handedly set race relations in the country back a decade because Jackie Robinson wasnt just fighting for himself he was wrestling for the very soul of America. In that sense no movie could accurately tell his story because there arent scripts that big shots that crisp or scenes that epic. ""42"" is a nice movie a kind and decent film but its not something that adds to Robinsons legacy in any meaningful way. Perhaps thats for the best for this is an occasion where real life was infinitely more compelling than the attempt to capture it on the big screen.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 12 2013 at 659 AM updated April 12 2013 at 1109 AM comments I was 9 years old and having dinner with my family at the famous Maneros steakhouse in Connecticut (""Try our garlic bread"") when a black man across the room caught my grandfathers attention. ""Get that gentlemans autograph"" said the hard-faced Dubliner who was never impressed by anyone. My father nodded agreement. My mother quickly dug a pen and notepad out of a purse full of Saltines and tissues. I went over obediently and asked and the grey-haired man politely signed. ""Jackie Robinson"" he wrote. I didnt know why my family was so excited when I came back to the table. But then I wasnt a baseball fan and civil rights wasnt part of the core curriculum at Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The name didnt mean much to me. It should have. It should mean something to everyone. And ""42"" a new but very old-fashioned movie tells us why. How Jackie Robinson -- backed by Brooklyn Dodgers chief Branch Rickey -- single-handedly broke the color barrier. How -- years before buses and schools followed suit -- he integrated the most American place of all The baseball diamond. It is no exaggeration to say Jackie Robinson made his country a better place. And he did it the way Gandhi did and the way Martin Luther King would -- by simply being better than the people who hated him. ""42"" is a bit obvious lunkily plotted and with starkly drawn characters. ""Like a TV movie"" I heard Chris Rock grumble as he left the screening -- and yes it would have been interesting to see what his friend Spike Lee would have done with this material. But Lee who tried for years to get this project going wanted to do it as an epic; what the studios wanted (and Brian Helgeland has brought to the screen) is a concentrated story almost exclusively devoted to Robinsons first season in the majors. That means naturally missing some great details. Like Robinsons amazing college career where he lettered in four sports at UCLA (and played on the same football team as the great Woody Strode). Or his military career in which the young officer was court-martialed (but exonerated) when he refused to move to the back of a bus. But thats alright because theres more than enough here -- both in Rickeys faith in Robinson and Robinsons belief in himself. Those words have deeper meaning here too. Rickey was a devout Bible-quoting Christian who took comfort in the fact that his new player was a fellow Methodist; the only way to survive this first season Rickey knew was if Robinson turned the other cheek. He just didnt realize how often he would have to turn it. Rickey is played by Harrison Ford with a padded gut and a pair of eyebrow weaves; it is the first time in years I have seen Ford have fun onscreen. He growls he yells he runs the gamut; he delights in being an actor again and not just a star. (And lets get premature A supporting Oscar nomination? Very possibly.) And Chadwick Boseman is perfect as Robinson. Its not just that he looks like the legend (and moves like an athlete); its that he captures in a clenched jaw or a sidelong glance a lifetimes worth of dearly attained dignity and barely contained rage. As for the movie itself -- well again it really would have been interesting to see Lees take. Because Helgelands approach while not as stuffily stylized as the caught-in-amber ""The Natural"" is full of overbearing music and thick with Hollywood cliches -- not least among them the tendency to tell a black mans story through a white mans eyes. But that doesnt mean it wont make you feel good. And it doesnt mean it isnt important to see. As for my Jackie Robinson autograph it disappeared -- until years later I found it again in a mildewed box. Creased and slightly stained its framed now under a still of the Dodger stealing home. It hangs in my sons room. And although I didnt know why this man was a hero he does. Everyone should. Ratings note The film contains strongly racist language and some violence. 42 (PG-13) Warner Bros.(128 min.) Directed by Brian Helgeland. With Chadwick Boseman Harrison Ford.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 12 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 12 2013 1002AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Brian Helgeland Written by Brian Helgeland Starring Chadwick Boseman Harrison Ford Classification PG Genre biopic Year 2013 Country USA Language English An unflawed hero neither weak of heel nor prone to hubris is certainly inspiring but not dramatically speaking very interesting. Armed with such a hero 42 dearly wants to inspire and for those who dont know about Jackie Robinson the man who ""broke the colour bar"" in baseball it may well prove so. Yet for the rest of us I fear its more likely to prove something else that hagiography is a tough sell. Screen grab from an online trailer for the film ""42"" Movies 42 The official trailer The Globe and Mail Video Video How baseball forges family bonds The sales pitch starts early when after a montage of war-weary America in 1945 a bright voice-over sets the tone ""Baseball was proof positive that democracy was still alive."" Well so heralded the game could hardly do less then attend to the teeny matter of democratizing itself led by the dominant figure of general manger Branch Rickey. Inflated in girth and proboscis Harrison Ford plays him with a perpetual stogie in hand and a penchant for straining his lofty words through a tightly clenched mouth. Vowing to ""bring a Negro player to the Brooklyn Dodgers"" he sorts through the candidates and finds in Robinson a superb athlete a war veteran and not least a fellow Lutheran.The deal is sealed and their first interview proceeds straight to the anointment. Warning Robinson of the racial taunts and harassment bound to come Rickey insists ""Like our Saviour you have to have the guts to turn the other cheek.""The rest of the film which confines its focus to the history-making events of the next two years takes that comparison pretty much to heart. But therein lies the problem. To sanctify Robinson to elevate him to godly heights - perfect man perfect husband perfect athlete perfectly gifted at the game - is in its own way to denigrate his vast achievements. Im not suggesting that the script is willfully covering anything up but to deny the man his simple mortal flaws is to make his struggle seem too easy.Of course this leaves newcomer Chadwick Boseman straitjacketed into a role with scant room to act anything but noble. Helped by a striking resemblance to the actual Robinson he does noble quite well. For his part director Brian Helgeland drenches the picture in a burnished palette as squeaky clean as the protagonists. Even the deep and depressed South sparkles like a fresh baseball plucked from the umpires bag. When Robinson at Florida spring training for his minor-league stint with the Montreal Royals tosses a souvenir to a young black boy the beaming kid looks to have stepped right out of a J. Crew catalogue. Again however well-meaning the intent the effect is to undercut the very bravery that is being trumpeted - a J. Crew look does a disservice to the harshness of a Jim Crow world.Suiting up for the dark side are the white trash who hurl the n-word from the stands or when Robinson makes it to the bigs from the opposing dugout. Yet the movie is careful to balance the moral ledger. Even in the South every racist has his opposite number like the grizzled old cracker who barges up to Robinson only to smile his toothless smile and declare ""Im pulling for you to make good.""Ditto in the Dodger clubhouse where the prejudiced are equally matched by the tolerant likes of Pee Wee Reese Ralph Branca and Eddie Stanky. More lively is Christopher Melonis grouchy cameo as Leo Durocher whose take on the race questions tends to the brutally pragmatic ""Ill play an elephant if it helps us win.""Tellingly the best scene in the film the only one with any real vitality is when the Saviour weakens. Faced with an especially vicious torrent of invective spewed by the Phillies manager Robinson pops out twice and in his failure were made to feel something of the titanic strength he must have needed to succeed. But then Helgeland ruins it by tacking on a grace note in the dugout corridor where Rickey appears to resurrect our hero with another of his buoyant sermons.To complete the pretty picture every villain receives his comeuppance. No act of racism in baseball goes unpunished here. Thanks to the heroics of Jackie Robinson such consistent justice might be true now - he could only have wished it were then. No doubt in the hallowed frames of 42 the legend is front and centre and still inspiring. Too bad the more interesting man is nowhere to be seen.

But not ""42 an inspiring old-school biopic that doesnt pull any punches in depicting the ugly racism that Jackie Robinson faced on a daily basis as the first African-American player in Major League Baseball. Writer-director Brian Helgeland (who wrote ""LA Confidential) hews to the facts in a manner practically unheard of in baseball movies which have always had a bias toward legend. Basically upbeat and not at all edgy ""42 may not be a home run but its certainly a solid three-base hit as worthy family entertainment. The relatively little-known and charismatic Chadwick Boseman has star-making turn as Robinson who played himself in a low-budget 1950 biopic. Boseman is perfectly teamed with a nearly unrecognizable Harrison Ford terrific in his first character role as gruff Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey. In 1945 Rickey a smart businessman and a devout idealist senses an opportunity to make history as well as a lot of money by tapping the huge talent pool in the Negro Leagues during a time when racism was pervasive beyond just the Jim Crow South. Robinson was chosen not because he was the most gifted -- that would be Satchel Paige -- but because he was a student athlete on integrated teams at UCLA. Offering Robinson a tryout for the Dodgers minor league affiliate in Montreal for the 1946 season Rickey extracted a promise from Robinson -- who had been court-martialed in the Army for refusing an order to move to the back of a bus -- to ""turn the other cheek at the many indignities and insults he would face in breaking baseballs color line. Turned away from hotels and airplanes shunned by teammates taunted by audiences and treated as a freak by the press Robinson is obliged to flee in a late-night lynch mob in Sanford Fla. (the same community where teenager Trayvon Martin was shot to death last year). Stellar work in the minors doesnt bring quick respect when he joins the Dodgers the following season. Several teammates sign a petition demanding his firing and a bigoted pitcher hits him in the squarely head with a baseball. Robinsons steely resolve is nearly broken when the Phillies manager (Alan Tudyk excellent) unleashes a stream of vile racist epithets that go far beyond the N-word. Its a hard scene to watch but an essential one. The epitome of grace under fire Robinson enjoys the unwavering support of his wife Rachel (Nichole Beharie) and African-American sportswriter Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) as well as Rickey and his manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni). Durocher unfortunately is suspended for the 1947 season after spring training by Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler. Not as the film has it for his affair with married actress Laraine Day (who later became his wife) but for consorting with underworld figures like Bugsy Siegel. Its a rare factual misstep in a film that takes great pains to get things right including a superb Lucas Black as Robinsons sympathetic teammate Pee Wee Reese and John McGinleys extraordinary impression of legendary sportscaster Red Barber. ""42 -- the title refers to the number on Robinsons jersey which was retired throughout Major League Baseball in 1997 -- has excellently staged game sequences not an easy feat for a sport that can comes off as boring on film. Basically upbeat Helgeland builds to an exciting climax as Robinson leads the Dodgers to a pennant -- the first of six -- during his rookie year. (The Bums won their only World Series by beating the Yankees in 1955.) Robinsons accomplishment speaks for itself and doesnt really need the incessant hyping of Mark Ishams overly intrusive score. Some of the films many telling quieter moments connect Robinsons struggle to our world of nearly 70 years later. One occurs in a beautifully handled scene in which teammate Ralph Branca (Hamish Linklater) asks why Robinson doesnt shower with the rest of the team. ""I dont want to make anyone uncomfortable Robinson says before Branca persuades him to change his practice. Its not hard to think of the rampant locker-room homophobia that has kept any active player on a major sports team from coming out as gay. Im no baseball fan but ""42""comes across as more than just a baseball movie. It successfully captures a pivotal moment in American history through the lens of our national pastime.

Knight Ryan Merriman Brad Beyer Brett Cullen Toby Huss Director Brian Helgeland Running time 207 Release Opened Apr 12 2013  Editorial Review Finally a film worthy of a legendBy Ann HornadayFriday April 12 2013Jackie Robinson has long been an elusive presence in contemporary American cinema as filmmakers from Robert Redford to Spike Lee have tried and failed to bring his life story to the screen. Brian Helgeland has finally succeeded in ""42"" a stirring straightforward and ultimately soaring portrayal of Robinsons historic entry into Major League Baseball in 1947. Anchored by a solemn quietly compelling lead performance from Howard University graduate Chadwick Boseman ""42"" possesses the solid bones honeyed light and transporting moral uplift that define an instant classic. With luck audiences will treat it as such and flock to it in numbers that encourage Hollywood to keep making em like this. ""42"" begins in 1945 when Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) decides to integrate the team. Insisting to his nervous associates that dollars arent black or white only green Rickey begins scouting for a player who not only will help the team win but also has the character to withstand the backlash that will ensue. He settles on Robinson a gifted athlete from California with an impressive record in the Negro leagues. When Robinson asks Rickey if hes looking for a player without the guts to fight back Rickey famously replies that hes looking for ""a player with the guts not to fight back."" Harrison plays Rickey with a jutting jaw squinting eye and hoarse bark straight out of the Irascible Old Coot playbook his character constantly invoking God and the almighty dollar to justify what became known as Rickeys ""noble experiment."" Late in the movie -- which mostly confines itself to 1946 when Robinson played for the Montreal Royals and 1947 his first season with the Dodgers -- Rickey admits to Robinson that he was seeking to redeem his own silence at the injustice of the games color line. ""You let me love baseball again"" Rickey says with a gruff choke in his voice. For his part Robinson remains silent a frustrating leitmotif throughout ""42."" Indeed the character proves to be a curiously recessive figure less a psychologically complex hero than a screen for others projections -- idealism and hope on the part of African Americans anxiety and hostility on the part of his teammates and virulent potentially violent animus on the part of his opponents and their fans -- which he endures with stoicism that borders on the saintly. Some have speculated that Robinsons restraint in the face of the harassment he suffered contributed to his early death in 1972. But little of that psychic turmoil is portrayed in ""42"" which clearly aspires to mythology rather than a more complicated naturalistic character study. Thats not to say that ""42"" is strictly feel-good. The film is suffused with the casual racism of the era especially when Robinson is traveling through the Jim Crow South (Helgeland lards his script with sly references to ""cultural heritage"" and ""way of life"" that strike timely notes in an era of Brad Paisley and ""Accidental Racist""). But the worst comes from the nominally integrated North specifically Philadelphia and Phillies Manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) whose vile stream of epithets during a game winds up rallying the Dodgers team and the crowd to the side of Robinson who withstands the abuse with level-eyed square-jawed forbearance. Robinson breaks down out of sight under the bleachers but other than a few wry exchanges with his wife Rachel (the lovely Nicole Beharie) and a monologue addressed to his newborn son we dont get much of a sense of his interior life. Instead ""42"" captures Robinson as a character whose meaning and power is primarily existential. It was his very being around which the vortex swirled -- a vortex of defiance pride pathological racism and finally awe. Helgeland enlisted a marvelous ensemble to bring that swirl to life beginning with Boseman who infuses Robinsons taciturn self-containment with watchful charisma and skillfully re-creates his signature skittering crablike dance off the bases. Some of the finest sequences in ""42"" are when Robinson craftily steals bases out from under his most hateful detractors. Such real-life supporting characters as journalist Wendell Smith game announcer Red Barber and Dodgers Manager Leo Durocher are portrayed in often funny note-perfect turns by Andre Holland John McGinley and Chris Meloni -- who regrettably disappears after Durocher is suspended over his affair with a married actress. Filmed with the gauzy nostalgic light of an American summer and insistently underlined by Mark Ishams overwrought Copland-esque orchestral score ""42"" is unapologetically corny but it never succumbs to offensive condescension. And a certain amount of old-fashioned sentiment is altogether appropriate for a movie in which composure professionalism and finesse manage to overcome far more destructive irrational forces. The film boasts particularly good sound design with every crack of the bat and thwack of the mitt emphasizing the ballistic hardness of a ball that in Robinsons case was often launched as a weapon. At one point Helgeland allows ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" to play in its entirety pointing up the irony of the line ""land of the free"" by coming to rest on Robinsons tense wary face. Like that one the films most gratifying sequences are on the field when Robinson is silencing his critics with the sheer beauty and athleticism of his playing and when his teammates -- who early in his career petitioned to have him removed -- can be seen gradually coming around as if waking from a particularly toxic trance. By the time Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) famously puts his arm around Robinson during a game in Cincinnati ""42"" has taken on cumulative undeniable momentum not just as classically rousing entertainment but as a quintessential story of American aspiration. Thanks to transitional figures like Robinson weve always been the home of the brave. To be the land of the free the film suggests we all need to step up to the plate.

"42 (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review 42 (PG-13) The amazing story of Jackie Robinson overcomes sentimentality and hammy acting. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com4/11/2013 Editor rating 2.5 The beauty of the Jackie Robinson story is that its so naturally inspiring that not even lethal amounts of bombast sentimental writing soaring strings hammy acting or desperate hyperbole can tarnish it beyond repair. Director Brian Helgelands version of Robinsons rise to become the first black player in major league baseball features healthy doses of all of the above and the script is so stale it might have been unearthed from an ancient box of Cracker Jacks. And still 42 persists in entertaining you even when youre cringing because the real story is so compelling. Few subjects have the power to make grown men grow misty with nostalgia as easily as baseball -- although certain Clint Eastwood films seem to have the same effect -- so audiences may not judge Helgeland too harshly. Director of the Mel Gibson revenge fantasy Payback and the dumb-fun A Knights Tale Helgeland has written terrific scripts before for Mystic River and L.A. Confidential. But with 42 he lets his worst instincts fly piling on platitudes when he could have given us a glimpse of an extraordinarily courageous man instead of a noble saint. Helgelands Robinson only once comes close to breaking down under the ugly vitriol thrown his way. This is myth-making not biography. Fortunately as Robinson Chadwick Boseman cuts a charismatic figure and he moves like a real baseball player (his twitchy shuffle when he prepares to steal bases is particularly amusing). As Branch Rickey the stubborn Brooklyn Dodgers executive determined to introduce black players into the league Harrison Ford fares worse relying on overwrought facial tics and bushy eyebrows to get by. The problem isnt entirely his fault; nobody sounds convincing when uttering such lines as ""Dollars arent black or white -- theyre green"" 42 would have us believe that Rickeys motives were entirely altruistic that his brief mention of making money by winning a World Series is just subterfuge to disguise his desire to right the great wrong of bigotry. Maybe Im just a suspicious South Floridian whose soul has been crushed by the Miami Marlins management but I suspect there were a few solid practical reasons too. The film follows the decision by Rickey to sign Robinson in 1945 and runs through spring training in Florida on to the 1947 season when Robinson first strode onto Ebbets Field to jeers and catcalls and a smattering of cheers. He faces setbacks and threats; a Philadelphia manager (Alan Tudyk) almost breaks his composure at the plate by hurling a stream of racist taunts. But one thing is guaranteed When a pitcher throws at his head Robinson is destined to pay him back in the pennant race. 42 is just that kind of simplistic movie. The film does carry off a pleasant nostalgic vibe and the tension in the Dodgers locker room where Jackie never knows if his teammates will shun him or shake his hand is handled effectively. Especially good is Christopher Meloni as Leo Durocher the Dodgers manager; his fiery presence grabs your attention like a fastball to the head. But his screen time is all too brief.

"Review 42 has Jackie Robinsons number - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Pleasing 42 has Jackie Robinsons numberThe real drama in the life of the history-making Brooklyn Dodger and stars Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Beharie make up for Brian Helgelands gee-whiz approach.April 11 2013|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""God built me to last"" Jackie Robinson says at one point in ""42"" and thankfully his remarkable story is built the same way. It would have to be to survive the full-dress Hollywood biopic treatment it gets in this film which is unabashedly subtitled ""The True Story of an American Legend."" And survive it does.You almost cant blame writer-director Brian Helgeland for taking an old-fashioned earnest-to-a-fault approach to the genuinely heroic narrative of the Brooklyn Dodger who in 1947 a in a move masterminded by team General Manager Branch Rickey -- broke the Major League Baseball color barrier led the Dodgers to the National League pennant and won rookie of the year honors.PHOTOS Scenes from 42Robinsons story had so much drama in real life and his sacrifice and pain made such a lasting influence that ""42"" ends up being effective in its gee-whiz way almost in spite of itself. The film is so on-the-nose it practically could have been made in 1947 (or 1950 when ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" starring the man himself hit theaters). But this is one square movie that youll just have to let be that way.In casting the roles of Robinson and his wife Rachel (who lived through all of this with him) Helgeland has made shrewd choices picking actors good enough to give their characters more texture than the film is set up to allow. Robinson is played by Chadwick Boseman who debuted playing another athlete Syracuse University running back Floyd Little in 2008s ""The Express."" The actor brings real force and dignity to the part as well as a fierceness that will not be pushed around.Taking on the helpmate role played by Ruby Dee in the 1950 film is the gifted Nicole Beharie memorable in very different roles in ""American Violet"" and ""Shame"" who uses all of her skill to ensure that this is Rachels story as well as Jackies.It also helps that Helgeland (an Oscar winner for writing ""L.A. Confidential"") does not soft-pedal the savage poisonous nature of the racism Robinson had to deal with. Especially effective in this regard is a sequence depicting the nonstop vitriol hurled at Robinson by Philadelphia Phillies Manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) a abuse Robinson had vowed not to respond to.For present-day viewers especially children who may not have heard this kind of language in real life prejudice as naked as this is tough to experience even on a movie screen.PHOTOS Game-changing baseball moviesMore often than wed like however ""42"" gives us standard tropes like unhappy stories getting told on stormy nights and women getting inexplicably sick and not realizing its because theyre pregnant. Racial barriers may disappear but some things really do never change.Before we enter Mr. Robinsons neighborhood we meet Rickey gamely played by Harrison Ford in padded three-piece suits and bow ties in spring 1945. Crotchety and cantankerous the general manager is determined to ""bring a Negro ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers"" even though aghast associates warn him that ""if you break an unwritten law youll be an outcast."" Rickey replies like a visionary more than an executive ""I dont know who he is but hes coming.""The audience of course knows exactly who ""he"" is and soon we catch up with Robinson playing for the Negro Leagues Kansas City Monarchs. In a scene showcasing Robinsons shrewdness as well as fire he maneuvers a Southern gas station owner into allowing the black ballplayers to use a whites-only restroom.Next comes the classic meeting with Rickey who race-baits the young man in order to give him a taste of what is to come. The general manager lets Robinson know that he must control his temper a no matter what is thrown at him a if this venture is to succeed.When Robinson wonders testily if the general manager is looking for someone without any guts Rickey memorably replies ""I want a player whos got the guts not to fight back."" And so the films dramatic tension gets established Will Robinson be able to restrain himself and how will he do it?With African American sportswriter Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) as advisor Robinson deals with racism not only from opponents but also umpires journalists and even members of his own team who petition Rickey not to let him play. He has difficulty adjusting to being in the public eye off the field but displays a ferocious competitiveness on the diamond that causes Dodgers Manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) to comment ""He didnt come to play he came to kill.""Robinsons combination of fortitude restraint and passion for the game was stunning. You cant help getting caught up in this story even as you are wishing the telling was sharper than it is.kenneth.turanlatimes.com-------------------------------42MPAA ratingA PG-13 for thematic elements including languageRunning timeA 2 hours 8 minutesPlayingA In general release PHOTOS AND MORE Roger Ebert Career in pictures ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVES42 a solid shot but no home run reviews sayApril 12 2013For parents 42 offers a chance to talk to kids about...April 12 2013Maybe canvas is a better venueApril 21 2006Brendan Frasers Real-Life Role Means Something to TeensMay 16 2000THE MOVIES  SUMMER SCREEN PREVIEW  Capsule descriptions...May 29 1988MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowFilmNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/11/entertainment/la-et-mn-jackie-robinson-42-review-20130412,200,4215,42,latimes

But when Hollywood casts its eye on the stories of real people - particularly the heroically brave ones - out come the gauze and the simplicity with any and all rough edges smoothed down or hidden altogether. So for all the 1940s hokiness of ""42"" with its big cars and big bands and peanuts and Cracker Jack its a wonderful surprise to see that theres a recognizable human being at the center of the hoopla. Theres a temptation to pretend that the great Jackie Robinson who integrated our national pastime of baseball in the pre-Civil Rights era was some sort of secular saint who coasted above the insults and slights and derision and death threats. Also read Jackie Robinson Biopic 42 Could Be Biggest Baseball Box-Office Opener Ever As portrayed here by writer-director Brian Helgeland (""A Knights Tale"") however Robinson kept a steady coil of rage inside of him. This was a man after all who was court-martialed during World War II for refusing to sit at the back of a bus. ""42"" celebrates an exceptional athlete not for his saintliness but rather for his ability to keep his temper when so many around him were losing theirs. Its a sentiment distilled in the first conversation between Negro League star Robinson (played by the electrifying Chadwick Boseman) and Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) ""You want a player that doesnt have the guts to fight back?"" asks the shortstop. ""No"" replies the man who will become his boss. ""I want a player whos got the guts NOT to fight back."" And not fighting back is what we see Robinson do whether its with racist fellow teammates or in the films most intense exchange with redneck Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) who subjects Robinson to a tsunami of what we now call hate speech. Also read The 15 Highest-Grossing Baseball Films of All Time Another interesting thing about ""42"" is that it doesnt paint a hokey picture as to why white people start questioning racism. Rickey wants to win the World Series; Robinsons fellow Dodgers see how ugly their epithets sound when Chapman spews them; and its the attack from outside that makes them band together as a team. The movie may soft-pedal the deeper uglier implications of race relations in this country but at least its less phony than a feel-good lie like ""The Help."" Where Helgeland missteps is in establishing sportswriter Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) as a narrator and unofficial aide-de-camp for Robinson early on. While Smith and Robinson were close in real life the reporter feels like a clunky device for ""42"" one the movie all but abandons midway through. And given that this isnt intended to be the strictest of histories (an opening card tells us that what were about to see is ""based on a true story"") Smith should have been utilized better and more consistently or not at all. Thats not to say that Holland doesnt do what he can with what hes been given; the cast overall is particularly strong with vets like Christopher Meloni (as Leo Durocher) Toby Huss Max Gail Lucas Black (as Pee Wee Reese) John C. McGinley (doing a very good Red Barber impersonation) and T.R. Knight filling out the roster. Ford does some of his most dynamic work in a while creating a rich character and allowing himself to disappear behind Rickeys bulbous nose. Nicole Beharie (""Shame"") makes Rachel Robinson anything but ""the girl"" that you might expect in this kind of movie; the scenes between the Robinsons are romantic and sexy generating real sparks and underlining the strength that these two people found in each other. And if youre here for the sports-movie stuff there are plenty of exciting moments many of them revolving around Robinsons talent for stealing bases and his unique ability to psych out pitchers. (Its admittedly tricky to come up with music for a baseball film that doesnt call to mind Randy Newmans immortal score for ""The Natural"" but it appears composer Mark Isham barely even tried.) ""42"" is a fairly slick confection but it wisely avoids hagiography mostly sticking to the facts in telling a compelling story about a truly extraordinary man. Its by no means the final word on the subject of Jackie Robinson (or baseball or race relations) but its a dazzling celebration of genuine daring. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Stevens/Warner Bros. Pictures CHADWICK BOSEMAN as Jackie Robinson in Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures drama 42 a Warner Bros. Pictures release. By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 11 April 2013 0438 PM Updated 12 April 2013 0121 AM Its an enticing but thankless task bringing Jackie Robinsons story to the big screen for a modern audience.A complicated justifiably angry man who wasnt shy with his opinions Robinson was long ago consecrated as a saint in the public imagination the man who integrated Major League Baseball and became a civil rights beacon. How if possible to make him merely mortal again?42 the new movie starring newcomer Chadwick Boseman as Robinson and Harrison Ford as Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey steps up and takes its hacks.Writer-director Brian Helgeland wisely doesnt try to encompass Robinsons entire life concentrating instead on the make-or-break rookie year of 1947. The period carries inherent drama. As Robinson made history he had to bite his tongue in the face of countless barbs and bean balls and survive the dissension of various Southern-born teammates.Thats all duly covered here. But 42 is still very much the Hollywood version of the Robinson story in its own way as hagiographic as 1950s Jackie Robinson Story (which starred the man himself). Thats not by definition a bad thing Sports movies have a long history at times a mandate to inspire. Its just that inspiration rarely jibes with the creation of a three-dimensional character.42 escapes the trappings of sheer hero worship largely thanks to Boseman whose relative anonymity eliminates any potential star baggage. More than that he strikes a tough balance. As his Robinson suffers the reactionary slings and arrows of the times he also lets a silent swagger define his body language and facial expressions.Robinson was a ticking time bomb as he waited out Rickeys edict to turn the other cheek. 42 doesnt let us see the Robinson Unleashed that came a couple of years later but thanks to Boseman we feel the tension build.I just wish 42 didnt telegraph so many of its moves. A little kid keeps appearing to remind us that Robinson is playing for our countrys future (thanks didnt know that) and moments based on real events manage to drift like a can of corn.Brooklyn shortstop Pee Wee Reese played by Lucas Black did indeed put his arm around Robinson on the field and the gesture of camaraderie was significant. But Helgeland cant help but let the moment linger past its dramatic expiration point. 42 kept reminding me of the running gag in Dont Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood where a postman pops up and shouts ""Message"" to accompany every matter of societal import.To its credit 42 brings the uplift without skimping on the moments unavoidable racism. It sheds its sugar coat long enough and often enough to remind us what Robinson was up against even if the character at the eye of the storm feels more like a symbol of hope than a warts-and-all human being.In the end it provides what Robinson must have longed for during his few quiet moments an escape.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.42(B) Directed by Brian Helgeland.

The structure is sheer contrivance--three narratives intricately interlocked--while the plot amounts to a convenience store of variably credible or borderline incredible strands. Yet the film is impressive all the same a bleak vision of life in the Internet age as an asocial network where faceless predators abound heedless kids live secret lives...

""Its our game - the American game."" Slideshow Jackie Robinson biopic a solid triple Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Video Trailer 42 More about 42 >> And like America it has had to come to terms with segregation bigotry ignorance and hate. 42 is the inspirational account of that historic coming-to-terms It is the story of Jackie Robinsons demolition of Major League Baseballs color barrier. A star player in the Negro Leagues he was handed a Brooklyn Dodgers uniform in April 1947. There were teams in the Jim Crow South that did not want him in their stadiums. In fact there were teammates in Brooklyn who did not want him in their locker room. There were hotels - including as the film reminds us in Philadelphia - that refused to accommodate the Dodgers with a black man in their lineup. There were jeers from the crowds death threats. And there was Robinson one of the most gifted players in the annals of the sport gleefully stealing bases and swatting balls out of the park. And stoically dealing with the epithets the threats of physical harm. Its a great and triumphant story and writer and director Brian Helgeland (an Oscar winner for his L.A. Confidential screenplay) brings it to life in burnished old-fashioned Hollywood style. In the 1990s after Spike Lee and Denzel Washington took on Malcolm X the director and the star talked of doing a Jackie Robinson biopic. It never happened and maybe thats a good thing. Casting a relative unknown as Robinson - the keen-eyed Chadwick Boseman - works in 42s favor the audience doesnt know what to expect of Boseman just as Major League Baseball didnt know what to expect from Robinson. Not so with Harrison Ford who adopts a codgery Midwestern demeanor to play Branch Rickey the Dodgers president and general manager and the man who decided it was time to integrate the game. This is the closest Fords come to real acting in a long time - his body language is different his voice the way he tilts his head and peers out through round tortoise shells. His Rickey is a decent man a religious man (like God he jokes a Methodist) a man with a sense of righteousness. And also a sense of business there are a lot of black people who love baseball and who will buy tickets to the games at Ebbets Field he figures. 42 doesnt shirk from showing how daunting it was for Robinson to turn the other cheek as Fords Rickey tells him he must do in the face of the insults and hostility. At bat in Shibe Park Robinson isnt just hurled fastballs - hes hurled a slew of racial slurs from Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk). Not a high point in the teams history or the citys. Nicole Beharie stars as Rachel Robinson Jackies steady-as-a-rock wife; Andre Holland is Wendell Smith the black sportswriter credited with suggesting Robinson to Rickey and shown here to be number 42s Boswell - the typewriter-toting chronicler of Robinsons record-breaking barrier-breaking career. Theres a scene early on when the Montreal Royals the Dodgers International League affiliate are in spring training and Clay Hopper the manager expresses a reluctance to coach a black player. Fords Rickey shows his understanding of how the manager a Mississippi native was fed racism ""at your mothers breast"" and then reads him the riot act. Tolerance respect inclusivity. On April 15 every player on every Major League team wears the number 42 on his uniform. Its a symbolic gesture but a beautiful one and 42 honors that tradition with pride.

"42 wins in extra innings review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies42 wins in extra innings review42 the story of baseball legend Jackie Robinsons early career in the majors is a stirring and occasionally inspiring film. By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. April 11 201342Starring Chadwick Boseman Harrison Ford and Nicole Beharie. Written and directed by Brian Helgeland. 128 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGThere are a lot of films about baseball a few of them great -- Bull Durham and The Natural come to mind. Theres an even greater number of films about downtrodden heroes rising and prevailing over adversity far too many to name.So writer/director Brian Helgeland has a dinger of a challenge in bringing the story of baseball legend Jackie Robinson -- the first black man to break the colour barrier in Major League Baseball -- to the silver screen.Article Continued BelowIts a relief to report that the result of his efforts -- 42 the number Robinson wore in his decade-long career with the Brooklyn Dodgers -- is well-paced and often riveting and manages to inspire while remaining true to the sport and to the player who changed it and all of professional sport forever.Helgeland is more experienced as a screenwriter than as a director having won an Oscar for best adapted screenplay for L.A. Confidential. It shows in the meticulous reconstruction of the events leading to Robinsons elevation from the Negro Leagues Kansas City Monarchs to the Dodgers farm club the Montreal Royals and his first year on the legendary team.The film opens with a newsreel snapshot of the U.S.A. in 1945 a time when ""Americas greatest generation"" was coming home from the Second World War and players like Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio were coming back to the game.But the Jim Crow laws throughout much of the U.S. that enforced segregation between blacks and whites remained stubbornly in place.""Were not in Pasadena anymore"" Robinsons new bride Rachel (Nicole Beharie) notes ruefully as she spots a ""Whites Only"" sign above the ladies room in the Florida town where Robinson has been sent for spring training.But Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) is determined to shake things up. Hes got reasons that go deeper than the argument he makes to shocked aides -- that ""dollars arent black and white theyre green"" -- and the team needs to add more fans from Brooklyns large black community.Ford anchors the film dominating every scene in his portrayal of Rickey gruff and gravelly voiced but with a strong moral core and an amusing interest in etymology.Relative newcomer Chadwick Boseman has the presence to carry the title role with a smoky voice soulful eyes and an easy smile. His performance is if anything nicely understated.Theres also some great supporting work from the cast including Christopher Meloni in an all-too-brief turn as manager Leo Durocher Lucas Black as team captain Pee Wee Reese and T.R. Knight as Rickeys mousy assistant Harold.Theres an absolutely loathsome (as in very good) performance by Alan Tudyk as Ben Chapman team manager of the Philadelphia Phillies whose racist tirade aimed at rattling Robinson at the plate results in his fellow Dodgers rallying around him. To his credit Helgelands script does not shy away from using the truly ugly language at the time. He also presents racism in its varied forms both overt and insidious and reminds us that those who sit on the fence too long share culpability with those who wear their black hearts on their sleeves.Helgeland and his team have a fine eye for detail recreating authentic costumes and settings and loading scenes with the vintage cars of the time.If the director falters at all it is in small ways allowing scenes to drag on too long. At more than two hours some filmgoers may feel the need for a seventh-inning stretch.He also fails to capitalize on a few critical scenes where a more experienced director would have wrung better performances (and greater emotional depth) from the cast.That said 42 is very solid entertainment inspirational without pontificating. While not quite a grand slam its definitely a winner that will get the fans on their feet.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT April 11 2013It takes a particularly ham-fisted filmmaker to transform the fascinating and historically significant story of Jackie Robinson something as formulaic as 42.Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as Jackie Robinson but 42 is a disappointingly formulaic film.(Photo D. Stevens Warner Bros. Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Chadwick Boseman Harrison Ford Nicole Beharie Christopher MeloniRated PG-13; runtime 2 hours 8 minutes; opens Friday nationwideIt takes a particularly ham-fisted filmmaker to transform a fascinating and historically significant story into something as formulaic as 42.The achievements of inspirational Jackie Robinson who broke the color barrier in major league baseball in 1947 dont need to be hammered home with blaring music platitudinous dialogue and over-earnest repetition. Robinsons contributions to the world speak volumes and would have benefited greatly from a less heavy-handed and stiff treatment than that by writer-director Brian Helgeland ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).Newcomer Chadwick Boseman is terrific as Robinson. He conveys a powerful blend of physicality bravery intelligence and stoicism. And Nicole Beharie is superb as his supportive wife Rachel. But Harrison Fordsportrayal of Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey is more blustery and caricatured than fully formed.STORY Harrison Ford takes the field in 42MORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAY Helgeland focuses excessively on Rickey at the expense of Robinson the first African-American allowed to play in the major leagues since the 1880s. The film is called 42 after all which was Robinsons uniform number (later retired by all major league teams). While Rickey is a key character theres not enough of Robinsons back story to convey the full drama of his place in history.Did Helgeland think that it would be more palatable to a mass audience if he focused on a white baseball executive as much as on a black player who changed the face of the game? Or was he simply so in awe at having landed a major movie star like Ford that he gave him an inordinate amount of screen time?The film focuses on the years between 1945 and 1947 culminating with Robinsons debut with the Dodgers. There is a brief reference to the Pasadena Calif. natives sports career at UCLA and to his time in the army where he received a court-martial for a temper flare-up.Later we see Rickey asking Robinson if he can avoid fighting back when he faces racist obstructionists. The player courageously withstands a wide range of discrimination from being refused a room at the teams usual hotel to aggressive taunting. First assigned to the Montreal Royals the Dodgers top farm team Robinson is treated badly during spring training and threatened by locals. Once he joins the Dodgers Robinson endures more ire from teammates and several sign a petition protesting his presence.Supporting players bolster the films potency. Christopher Meloni is wonderful as the no-nonsense player-turned-manager Leo Durocher who nips the petition in the bud. Alan Tudyk gives an unnerving performance as Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman who relentlessly unleashes invective at Robinson during a pivotal game. The insults he hurls are so vile as to be almost unbearable for the audience to endure.By focusing on Robinsons first season in 1947 the film feels incomplete despite a few powerful scenes on the diamond. The viewer yearns to know what came before and after his record-breaking debut. 97 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/XFiho9,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/Psok9FQ9-mo/,200,4221,42,usatoday

This Monday every player in Major League Baseball will wear the same number on his jersey 42 which was Jackie Robinsons number when in 1947 he became the first black player in the majors playing first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Today baseball celebrates April 15 as Jackie Robinson Day. But 66 years ago not everyone saw his hiring as cause for celebration -- and the earnestly grandiose biopic 42 means to illuminate that history-making moment in which racial vitriol met its match in a ballplayer who let his talent do the talking. Not without a struggle of course. When Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford in a pitchers mound worth of makeup) tells a promising Negro League shortstop (Chadwick Boseman) that hes hoping to hire him to play at Ebbets Field he does not make shattering an eight-decade tradition of segregated baseball sound like itll be a walk in the park. ""People arent going to like this"" Rickey growls at the rookie by way of urging him not to take the bait when he gets baited. Better says the GM He should turn the other cheek and win by playing great ball. The 26-year-old Robinson wants clarification -- ""You want a player who hasnt got the guts to fight back?"" -- and gets it in almost the same words the real Jackie Robinson got when he played himself in the 1950 drama The Jackie Robinson Story ""No I want a player who has the guts not to fight back."" That took a lot of guts what with death threats jeers from the stands resistance from white teammates and baseball executives determined to bar him from their parks. Writer-director Brian Helgeland lays out the history in bold clear strokes with little nuance but lots of atmosphere. A heavily made-up Harrison Ford plays Brooklyn Dodgers manager Branch Rickey in 42. The real-life Rickey helped convince a wary Robinson that the time was right for a racially integrated major league. D. Stevens/Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption D. Stevens/Warner Bros. It helps that this was an era when color commentary was still colorful; here much of it is provided by John C. McGinley doing what longtime Morning Edition listeners will recognize as a fine Red Barber impression. Under Barbers watchful gaze Robinson endures injuries racial slurs and viciousness all of it on one side. And all of that will build sympathy for the talented rookie growls Rickey at one point in a line that sounds like Helgeland explaining how his movie works. And sure enough the writer-director never lets Boseman play Robinson for anything other than saintly nobility and if thats not inherently interesting it would still be hard to watch 42 without feeling protective of its hero as prejudice spews so openly. Or without being heartened when other characters ""evolve"" as it were Kentucky boy Pee Wee Reese for instance throwing his arm supportively around Robinsons shoulder and standing with him at midfield as a Cincinnati crowd jeers (a real-life incident) making a case for being on the right side of history. As hes doing that youll hear the score doing plenty of heavy lifting putting a sort of musical halo around Robinsons every move. Definite overkill -- gilding the lily though its all but irresistible. As is the tug of 42 a profile in real-life courage that would be stronger as a movie if it werent quite so intent on underlining teachable moments. ""Maybe tomorrow"" says Reese ""well all wear 42 so they wont tell us apart."" Shameless sure. But effective.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 457pm on Thursday Apr. 11 2013 Thursday Apr. 11 2013 Thursday Apr. 11 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram In April 1947 Jackie Robinson walked on the field as a Brooklyn Dodger and left a legend.Thats 42 director Brian Helgelands celebratory look at the life of the pioneer who smashed baseballs color line distilled to its Hollywood biopic essence. More heartfelt hagiography than muckraking biography this is no slice of revisionist history or deep psychological exploration. Even the most woefully sports-ignorant probably know all the plot points here by heart.Yet for all its feel-good sports-movie predictability 42 -- named for Robinsons number on his uniform -- is surprisingly effective and even at a couple of points moving.Chadwick Boseman is Robinson a talented shortstop for the Negro Leagues Kansas City Monarchs who is scouted by Dodgers president Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) who has plans to integrate the team. Rickey is motivated not only by whats right but what he sees as the games financial future.Of course Rickeys advisers are horrified by the idea and once Robinson is signed hes subjected to a shower of verbal abuse from teammates fans and members of opposing teams. (North Texas own Alan Tudyk has a short but memorable part as Philadelphia manager Ben Chapman who hurls racial epithets like fastballs.)Thanks to his talent and perseverance Robinson begins to break down barriers with some of the other Dodgers. A couple -- Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) and Ralph Branca (Hamish Linklater) -- might even be considered friends by the end.Through it all Robinson can rely on the support of his wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie American Violet) and sports reporter Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) whom Rickey has hired to be Robinsons assistant.Yet except for one scene when Chapmans name-calling nearly gets to Robinson and he has to be talked back onto the field by Rickey the audience doesnt really get to feel the emotional torment Robinson must have been experiencing. Its as if Helgeland who also wrote the script was afraid to show Robinson with any flaws whatsoever.Still there are small moments -- when Reese puts his arm around Robinson in front of a jeering Cincinnati crowd or when Branca finally persuades Robinson to shower with the rest of his team -- that give 42 a sense of humanity that deepens the films story arc. If only there were more of them.But Helgeland ( Payback) has a lot of life to squeeze into just over two hours. As it is he concentrates on the years 1945-47 and 42 still feels rushed and telescoped in spots.By the end though its hard not to get caught up in Robinsons struggle even though everyone knows how it turns out. Boseman (known mostly for TV roles up to now) plays Robinson with the right combination of bravado and indignation Ford is appropriately crusty as Rickey and Christopher Meloni ( Law amp; Order SVU) makes for an engagingly irascible Leo Durocher the Dodgers manager.42 may not hit it out of the park but it doesnt drop the ball either. Sometimes thats the best you can ask for.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Brian Helgelands epic about Jackie Robinsons first year in Major League Baseball is uneven -- often exciting and just as often shallow and ham-handed -- but if theres one thing to which it remains true its that the almighty American greenback and the all-American athlete are the great destroyers of bigotry. After some brief narration setting the stage (World War II is over fascism has been defeated abroad but segregation is alive and well here in the U.S.) the film opens on Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers announcing to his staff that hes going to hire a black baseball player for the upcoming season. Ford gives Rickey a voice so growly youd think someone just woke him from a thousand-year nap and Helgeland plays up the starstruck irony He reveals his actors face with a camera move that circles around from behind to hit us with the full impact of Indiana Jones cast against type. (Sergio Leone deployed a similar camera gag on Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West.) ""Think about how this is gonna play on Flatbush"" one of Rickeys men protests in what is not the films sole instance of nudge-nudge counterpoint with the modern day. But Rickey cant be swayed from his argument Theres a growing black fan base for baseball and he wants to tap into it. ""Dollars arent black and white"" he roars. ""Theyre green"" As if to prove his point the very next scene shows us then-Negro League player Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) convincing a racist gas station attendant to let him use a whites-only restroom by threatening to take his teams business elsewhere ""Well get our 99 gallons of gas someplace else."" Money may not buy us love but apparently it can buy us social justice. Of course Jackie Robinson turns out to be a pretty exceptional baseball player and we know what that means ""Winning means money"" Rickey explains to his manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) telling him Robinson needs to be part of the team. Baseball and money soften many a hard heart over the course of 42. Much of this is probably historically accurate but in true Hollywood fashion its raised to the level of myth accompanied by Mark Ishams predictably twinkly treacly score. (There are something like four musical crescendos in the first fifteen minutes alone.) The film also makes sure to tie it all into the Christian notion of self-sacrifice. ""Like our savior you gotta turn the other cheek"" Rickey explains later professing that as a white man hes at a disadvantage to Robinsons plight ""Youre the one living the sermon"" he points out a bit too helpfully. To be fair the real Branch Rickey was very much a God-fearing man and his conversations with Robinson did reportedly run like this. But again does the movie have to be so artless about it? Helgelands film is at its best when it focuses on the diamond. As Robinson Boseman has both physical grace and sly charm. Threatening to steal bases we watch him toy with opposing pitchers in a nearly silent-film pantomime thats both playful (because hes so damned likable) and tense (because practically everyone else is such a fire-breathing racist). In the films most effective set piece Robinson attempts to hit a ball while Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) the manager of the opposing Phillies spews out enough N-word-laden bile to make Quentin Tarantino shrivel up in a fetal position. Credit where its due After a lot of setup 42 spends most of its time on the playing field where it is most effective and exciting. Baseball fans will probably eat this stuff up. A At times the films strengths serve to highlight its flaws. Alongside the charismatic Boseman Nicole Beharie is so passionate as his wife that we wish she had more to do than just swoon and cheer; you might find yourself wondering if this married couple ever had anything resembling a real argument or even a fight. Ford for all his hamminess also brings his scenes a delirious crowd-pleasing energy -- oddly making you wish there was a bit more to him than the long strings of cliches that serve as his dialogue. For all that though 42 works because it practices what it preaches If youre good at baseball nothing else really matters. So forget about story character or subtlety. 42 can play and it knows it.

Comments (1) click to enlarge 42 Recommended Video Rated PG-13  128 minutes  2013 Like many Hollywood sports movies this Jackie Robinson biopic seems to be pitched at high schoolers but writer-director Brian Helgeland still manages a pretty absorbing account of Robinsons rookie year as the first black player in major league baseball. Chadwick Boseman is appropriately anguished as Robinson who struggles to control his rage as he absorbs a torrent of abuse from white fans players and officials. But ironically the most valuable player here is Harrison Ford giving one of the best performances of his career as Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey. At 70 Ford has finally grown into his curmudgeonly persona and he digs into the role of Rickey reconciling the deep feeling of Christian brotherhood and naked professional ambition that motivated him to give Robinson a shot. The strong supporting cast includes Nicole Beharie Christopher Meloni Alan Tudyk and John C. McGinley (as sportscaster Red Barber). By J.R.

Its a valuable history lesson an intelligent drama that hits all the right emotional buttons and an inspiring portrait of a true American hero. It is also at times a prime example of Hollywood schmaltz stuffed with more processed cheese than a gas-station danish. Overall? Its great the sort of all-embracing sports movie that lifts an audience to its feet applauding. The story of Jackie Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey the trailblazers who broke professional baseballs color barrier gets its dramatic balance right. With a legend such as Harrison Ford playing Rickey and the far lesser-known Chadwick Boseman as Robinson this might have become another patronizing movie in which blacks become supporting players in their own stories. Instead they and writer/director Brian Helgeland (Oscar-winning screenwriter of ""L.A. Confidential"" and many more) create multidimensional emotionally complex men. Like the Hall of Famer he plays Boseman enters this game a promising rookie and leaves the field a champ. Robinson was signed in 1947 by the notoriously tightfisted Rickey to draw Brooklyns black baseball fans to Ebbets Field. ""Money isnt black or white. Its green"" Rickey tells his dumbstruck underlings when he proposes the unthinkable move. The film argues that his motives were not so shallow. Baseball at the time was decidedly not ""Americas game"" since Americans who were not white could not play professionally. A pious Methodist Rickey aims to fix that injustice. He sees in Robinson a man with biblical strength of character who can maintain stoic dignity in the face of racist taunting and death threats from fans. Years earlier as a college baseball coach Rickey had failed to do all he could to protect a black player from humiliation; through Robinson he hopes to atone for past sins. Robinson an individualist and a team player wants to prove hes any mans equal if not better on the field. A veteran of World War II he sees bigotry as a scourge like fascism and integrating the national pastime as a blow against continued injustice. And he wants to provide for his wife (charmingly played by Nicole Beharie) and newborn son. Warner Bros. Dodgers executive Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) signs Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the contract that changed baseball. Boseman is engaging and convincingly athletic swinging with authority diving headlong across the plate and nabbing speeding balls like frogs eat flies. Hes also up to the demands of a big role giving us flares of rage and dark moments of despair frustration confusion. This is not the deified Jackie Robinson of popular imagination but a man of uncommon courage who struggled to maintain his composure and shrug off vitriol while outplaying everybody else. The film captures the look of vintage ballparks and the zeitgeist of America years before the civil rights movement. Whites Only accommodations racist violence and vile slurs are commonplace. Alan Tudyk sheds his usual comic charm to play Ben Chapman the Philadelphia Phillies manager whose verbal harassment of Robinson makes for ""42s"" most painful scenes. When hes forced by the league to have a photo taken with Jackie to signify that African-American players would be accepted in Philly his expression of discomfort provides one of the films biggest laughs. For pure comedy though nothing can top Hamish Linklater as Robinsons teammate Ralph Branca whose well-intentioned invitation for Jackie to relax and share the showers with him comes out all wrong. ""42"" is hokey at times and inspirational nonetheless. It re-creates an era that should not fade into memory and demonstrates how small daily acts of courage can be revolutionary not just in baseball but in life.

"42 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 42 ) 42 (United States 2013) April 11 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli 42 tells the (mostly) true tale of how Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) broke the Major League color barrier in 1947 becoming the first black player to appear in a Major League baseball game since 1884. Robinsons story is inspirational and there are times when Brian Helgelands conventional narrative evokes powerful emotions. Unfortunately the generic bio-pic structure of 42 prevents it from ever becoming something great. The film takes no chances and does nothing bold. Its a competent chronicle of Robinsons life from 1945 through 1947 but it doesnt do much more than a documentary could do. Instead of being the definitive cinematic interpretation of Robinsons turbulent clash with baseballs deeply embedded culture of segregation it offers a rote account of events. Its worth seeing because the film is competently presented and the story is inherently important but I couldnt help be disappointed that the result wasnt more fresh or visionary. 42 tells of Robinsons year in the minors and his first campaign with the Brooklyn Dodgers. While not doing an especially good job of capturing Robinsons personality - hes more of an icon than a fully developed character - it effectively realizes the wall of racially-motivated resistance that greeted him upon his inauguration as a player in what was a white mans game. When Dodgers GM Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) tells Robinson ""I want a player with the guts not to fight back"" we understand what he was up against in 1947. Helgelands biggest problem is that he tries to do too much with the film. There are really three separate stories vying for screen time Robinsons personal tale away from baseball which includes his romance with wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie) and his relationship with his children; Robinsons struggles against often violent forms of racism on and off the field; and the way in which Robinson influenced not only baseball but society as a whole. We get bits and pieces of all three shaken together and blended into something that a times feels incomplete. An argument can be made that theres no way to effectively narrow down the movies scope without impacting its themes but the same contention could have been made about Spielbergs Lincoln and look how that turned out. If Helgelands intention was to tell Jackies story in a linear paint-by-numbers fashion he has achieved that goal. The most compelling scenes in 42 happen on the baseball field. Thats where Robinsion shows off the dynamic athleticism that made him Branch Rickeys choice to break the color barrier. In one sequence he reaches first steals second steals third then comes home on a single. Thats more dramatic than when he hits a home run. The centerpiece of 42 recounts Robinsons real-life verbal excoriation by racist Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk). Although Chapman wasnt the only opponent to hurl epithets at Robinson his tirades are by far the most persistent and vicious. Chapmans assaults while humiliating to Robinson in the moment when they occur have unintended consequences; not only do they hasten Robinsons acceptance by his teammates but they help to turn the tide among moderate baseball fans. Chapmans words are widely reported in newspapers and many whites are appalled. TV actor Chadwick Boseman provides an effective Robinson. Theres not a lot of depth in his performance but hes convincing on the bases in the field and at-bat and shows enough emotion to give the historical figure an element of humanity. Harrison Fords physical resemblance to Branch Rickey is impressive but the performance skews toward making the Dodgers GM into a candidate for sainthood. Theres little doubt that there was an element of idealism in Rickeys decision to integrate baseball but the film presents him as a man with few (if any) character flaws. Outside of these two actors no one has much to do. Alan Tudyks Chapman is suitably nasty providing a capable antagonist (if only for a few scenes). Nicole Beharie is attractive fulfilling the ""stand by her man"" role. And Lucas Blacks Pee Wee Reese becomes the only non-anonymous Dodger player not named Robinson. For those unfamiliar with Robinson his era or his struggles 42 represents a solid introduction to what the man meant to baseball and the civil rights struggle. The movie works better as a teaching tool than as a pure drama although its weaknesses as the latter are in part counterbalanced by the compelling nature of the story it tells. For baseball fans theres the added benefit of excellent recreations of 1940s era stadiums and play. Their authenticity and the lack of grievous mistakes in the way the game is represented make this a worthwhile sports movie thats about more than winning and losing. 42 (United States 2013) Director Brian Helgeland Cast Chadwick Boseman Harrison Ford Nicole Beharie Christopher Merloni Ryan Merriman Lucas Black Alan Tudyk Screenplay Brian Helgeland Cinematography Don Burgess Music Mark Isham U.S. Distributor Warner Brothers Run Time 205 U.S. Release Date 2013-04-12 MPAA Rating ""PG-13"" (Violence Profanity) Genre DRAMA Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Cider House Rules The (1999) Maria Full of Grace (2004) Lilya 4-Ever (2003) worse movies of this genre Hole in My Heart A (2005) Neon Demon The (2016) Showgirls (1995) Three...better movies of Chadwick Boseman Draft Day (2014) Captain America Civil War (2016) (There are no more better movies of Chadwick Boseman) worse movies of Chadwick Boseman Gods of Egypt (2016) Get On Up (2014) (There are no more worst movies of Chadwick Boseman) Three...better movies of Harrison Ford Star Wars IV A New Hope (1977) Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back (1980) worse movies of Harrison Ford Paranoia (2013) Six Days Seven Nights (1998) Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) Three...better movies of Nicole Beharie Shame (2011) (There are no more better movies of Nicole Beharie) worse movies of Nicole Beharie (There are no more worst movies of Nicole Beharie) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2608,200,4227,42,reelviews

A newsreel-style opening offers the historical context Hollywood cant trust high schools to have provided; in it narrator Andre Holland toasts to ""the greatest generation""--an honorific that takes on ironic weight as the film amasses its considerable power. Sure they licked Hitler but how can we call them the greatest Americans ever when they freed up their afternoons to head down to the ballpark and shout ""nigger"" at Jackie Robinson?""I realize that attitude is part of your cultural heritage"" Harrison Ford rumbles as Branch Rickey the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers to a minor-league coach who expresses distaste about taking Robinson on with the Montreal Royals previously a whites-only team. (""Montreal Royals"" has so much major-league failure ever been built into a single name?) That coach comes around because he and Rickey--to flip a racist phrase of the day--are each one of the good ones white folks who transcend their raising and become credits to their race.Film Details 42 RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time128 More Info Trailer In the first half grand moments of Robinsons life (and American history) drift past like parade floats well crafted incidentally arresting but not strung together into a dramatic narrative. Chadwick Boseman who stars as Robinson at first seems given only two things to play quiet confidence at the plate and even quieter stoicism when insulted by white folks. He aces both but he and the movie both get more interesting the closer Robinson gets to the Dodgers and Ebbets Field--here a video-game recreation that never quite fools the eye.In the majors we have a story one that grows more and more compelling right up until the ridiculously protracted climactic slow-mo baserunning. Some Dodgers revolt against Robinsons arrival hotels refuse to book the team on the road and then there are the death threats the pitchers aiming for his face and the Philadelphia coach who actually shouts ""You dont belong here Get that through your thick monkey skull"" A dusty intimacy distinguishes the baseball scenes which are excellent if abbreviated. Robinsons duels with pitchers are especially involving both at the plate and on base where he harrows the bastards like Bugs Bunny might Elmer Fudd. Helglends commitment to ball-game detail invigorates the film; besides the rousing pitch outs were treated to announcer Red Barber deeming a game ""tighter than a new pair of shoes on a rainy day"" and a 10-year-old boy explaining a balk to his mother.As Robinson takes the white worlds abuse Bosemans eyes moisten redden and finally seem to scab over with anger and hurt. Those scabs get ripped off once courtesy of that Philly coach and a couple tough at-bats. Boseman--so adept at holding back at suffering--at last gets to rage. Off the field he shatters a bat and howls a moment of welcome rawness that Helgeland immediately balms with avuncular words from Fords pleasantly absurd Rickey. In the role Ford plumbs the depths of his voicebox and phlegms up his breathing; he sounds like Walter Matthau doing Nixon. After the fightin senior nonsense of that last Indiana Jones movie hes finally playing an old man for real hunched over tweeded out George Will-style and never even close to punching anybody.Rickey integrates baseball against its will and Robinson of course wins over the Flatbush Faithful. But this isnt presented as the usual victory for principled liberalism. The movie is engineered to appeal to what Variety calls a ""faith-based audience""--which really describes anyone who still finds hope enough to pony up for movie tickets. Rickey insists that the only color he cares about is green as in the money black ballplayers are bound to bring in. For most of the film hes a free-market integrationist a best-case example of the argument that the greater good is yoked to the invisible hand. A devout Methodist his quotations from scripture add to 42s steady hum of Good Book moralizing. Theres little of the drinking or swearing youd expect in a baseball movie and Rickey even gets to preach against adultery. (The bible verses segregationists used to support their cause are conspicuously absent.)Boseman mostly manages to play a flesh-and-blood man despite 42s attempts to present him as a statue just unveiled. Helgeland limits the scope to Robinsons first major league season so were spared the usual through-the-decades biopic rush. Another boon Robinsons marriage is a happy one and Nicole Beharie playing his wife gets to smile and talk baseball rather than endure the usual long-suffering bride-of-the-famous-man routine.Still the movie sugars up Robinsons story and like too many period pieces it summons some vague idea a warmer simpler past by bathing everything in thick amber light as if each scene is one of those preserved mosquitoes that begat the monsters of Jurassic Park. Its the honeyed light of nostalgia but what exactly about this 1947 are we supposed to yearn for today? That eras more open racism? The suffering endured by anyone who stood up to it? The novelty of a black man taking a previously white job--and catching serious hell for it every single day?Lets go with ""afternoon games.""Follow VoiceFilmClub Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

America prefers its civil rights leaders to be humble which is why theres a holiday for Dr. King but not Malcolm X. Hanging at every Major League ballpark in America is a tribute to the saintly Jackie Robinson the number 42 which has been permanently retired. The inspirational movie named for Robinsons number is too dignified to throw audiences a curveball let alone a knockdown pitch but its solid fundamentals make it a winner.As in most of Hollywoods movies about racial injustice a white character looms large. But Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford exercising his character-acting muscles) deserves an honored place in history for his decision to sign the first black ballplayer to a Major League contract.Although Rickey (a longtime executive for the Cardinals) tells his skeptical staff that the only color he cares about is green he proves to be a principled man in the way he recruits and grooms the right player from the Negro Leagues Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) a 26-year-old shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs who was a four-sport star at UCLA and a lieutenant during World War II. Rickey signs Robinson to the Dodgers minor-league team in Montreal on the condition that he turn the other cheek whenever hes inevitably insulted. Robinsons first spring training in Florida is also the first encounter with segregation for the Pasadena Calif. native and his wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie).When Robinson debuts with the Major League team in 1947 writer-director Brian Helgeland (""Payback"") judiciously splits the other players reactions between racist jibes and fraternal support (with Lucas Black a standout as supportive Southerner Pee Wee Reese).Likewise the fans in the stands seem evenly divided between louts and loyalists. Thus theres a potent element of personal culpability when the Philadelphia Phillies manager (Alan Tudyk) taunts Robinson and when a wide-eyed white boy in Cincinnati joins his father in tossing slurs at the Negro newcomer. Along with the realistic complexity of the racial dynamic theres an admirable attention to detail in the midcentury sets and costumes. And not incidentally the actors are believable baseball players.Unfortunately the music bats us over the head needlessly reminding us to cringe whenever Robinson is insulted and cheer whenever goodness triumphs. As the fully human Robinson Boseman doesnt need these intentional walks in order to score and the moral force of this true story still resonates across the years.

(Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Sunday April 14 2013 733 PM Title 42 Film Info With Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford. Drama of Jackie Robinson joining the Majors in 1947. Director Brian Helgeland. (208) PG-13; Language. Area theaters Opens Friday. A moving all-around terrific telling of Jackie Robinsons first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers and his breaking of baseballs color line in 1947 ""42"" is an all-star drama that covers all the bases. Its a sports film nonsports fans can love; its a family film that never preaches; its a biopic that also takes in the world and people around its subject. There are scenes that soar and challenge -- and a half-dozen that will make tears well up -- but the simple ones resonate too. The story begins with a declaration ""Gentlemen I have a plan."" Thats Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey (a terrific Harrison Ford) telling his staff he intends ""to bring a Negro ballplayer"" to the team. He doesnt know the player yet but in that dusty New York office history is decided. Harrison Ford (left) plays Branch Rickey then owner of the Dodgers who decides to bring a Negro ballplayer to the team. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture) That player will be Robinson (cinematic rookie of the year Chadwick Boseman) introduced playing in the Negro League winning games and stealing bases. When he hears Rickeys offer Robinson is incredulous -- and ready for the worst. As ""42"" shows he had reason to be. The unwritten code he and Rickey were challenging was ingrained not only in baseball management the press and many fans but Dodgers players as well. Before Robinson can be one of ""Dem Bums"" Rickey adds him to the Dodgers Montreal farm team then signs him to play in Ebbets Field (reconstructed via CGI). His major league debut on April 15 1947 wearing number 42 is jolting for being so basic. A man walks onto a field with other men. Yet hes followed by cameras and curses. Harrison Ford (left) is almost grandfatherly but gruff as Branch Rickey opposite Chadwick Bosemans (right) Jackie Robinson who is watchful winning and confident -- but never saintly. (D. Stevens) The enemy -- angry bigotry -- is out in force as Rickey warned. But Robinson keeps his cool even when later grotesque Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) taunts him in the films toughest scene. Writer-director Brian Helgeland uses an unblinking use of the N-word to put us in Robinsons shoes. Were as pained as he is so when he explodes -- in a stirring moment after Chapmans insults when Robinson releases a heartbreaking wail -- the rising cry lifts us that much higher. By keeping ""42"" concerned mostly with that first season Helgeland keeps the climb taut. Its also wisely grounded by the Robinson-Rickey pairing. Nicole Beharie plays Jackie Robinsons wife Rachel in 42. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture) There are other major connections including Nicole Beharie as Jackies strong wife Rachel; Andre Holland as the Robinsons friend and chronicler sportswriter Wendell Smith; and Lucas Black as shortstop Pee Wee Reese the ultimate man of decency. The sense of each person helping the other defeat injustice is lovely and layered. Boseman is watchful winning and confident but never saintly. Yet he keeps Robinsons moral spine aligned with his skill and self-respect showing how he needed all of those to succeed. Ford in a real character turn is grandfatherly but gruff. The great action star allows himself to look old his voice a Bogart-like growl as the irascible sports vet Rickey slyly says hes integrating baseball ""for business reasons."" 42 opens in theaters on Friday April 12. (D. Stevens) The magnificent ""42"" shows how mankind was his business. jneumaiernydailynews.com On mobile?

"Review 42 - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 42 Jackie Robinson has to share the spotlight with Branch Rickey  1/2April 15 2013|Michael Phillips | Movie critic""42"" writer-director Brian Helgelands carefully tended portrait of Jackie Robinson treats its now-mythic Brooklyn Dodger with respect reverence and love. But whos in there underneath the mythology? Has the movie made Robinson a man who endured so much in the name of breaking Major League Baseballs color barrier and then died before his 54th birthday something less than three-dimensionally human?Im afraid so. This is a smooth-edged treatment of a life full of sharp painful inspiring edges. Helgeland tips the narrative balance in the direction of Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey played here in a sustained grumble by Harrison Ford opposite Chadwick Bosemans implacable Robinson. The latters story cannot be brought to life without Rickeys and vice versa; their fates and their places in history belonged to one another.But ""42"" settles for too little for being an attractive primer an introduction to the legend of Robinson and the faith that saw him through. The movie doesnt condescend. Rather it protects and enshrines.Helgeland focuses on 1945 46 and 47 the years in which Robinson married got signed by the Dodgers for their minor league affiliate in Montreal and then momentously swung his way into 20th-century heroism as the first African-American in pro baseball. Boseman has the right stuff to take on Robinson. The movie allows him scant opportunity to prove as much. After each new encounter with prejudice and racism Helgeland shows us the man who soldiered on without losing his composure certainly not to the degree so many were hoping hed lose it.Yet we spend so little private time with this private man. We see on screen with Nichole Beharie as Robinsons adoring wife Rachel a dream of a marriage. Some of the stresses are acknowledged in passing. Some of them.As for Ford hes fun. He gets all the good zingers while everyone else stands around looking either impressed or aghast or discreetly angry. Rickey may well have once said ""You practically nursed race prejudice at your mothers breast"" to a racist team manager or something like it. The way the line drops itself in the scene in question however feels screenwriterly in the extreme. Helgeland has talent (""L.A. Confidential"") but the ""42"" script has the tentative air of a project watched very very closely by Robinsons survivors.For better or worse a couple of supporting players steal the movie. As Leo Durocher Dodgers coach and controversial horn dog Christopher Meloni injects a jolt of energy. And as announcer Red Barber John C. McGinley curbs his usual outsized exuberance to nail with perfect period inflections the play-by-play commentary featuring such phrasing delicacies as ""chin-wag.""""Like our savior"" growls Fords Rickey at one point after Bosemans tightly wrapped Robinson has eaten his latest load of racial epithets ""you gotta have the guts to turn the other cheek."" I dont recall Robinsons rejoinder but its likely he didnt have one; there are times in ""42"" when Robinson appears confined to the dugout of his own biopic. Maybe this approach is justified In Robinsons 1972 autobiography as quoted recently in a New York Times piece Robinson wrote ""Today as I look back on that opening game of my first World Series I must tell you that it was Mr. Rickeys drama and that I was only a principal actor. As I write this 20 years later I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world. In 1972 in 1947 at my birth in 1919 I know that I never had it made.""Hints of that man that complicated hero can be detected in ""42.""

"42 does not go deep in telling Jackie Robinsons story - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate 42 does not go deep in telling Jackie Robinsons story Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 04.11.13 | 314 PM One of my daughters got bit by the baseball bug back when she was in grammar school. We took her to Fenway signed her up for softball showed her ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Pride of the Yankees."" She read all the baseball biographies she could get her hands on those picture-heavy Scholastic books about the Babe and the Splendid Splinter and the Say Hey Kid. And Jackie Robinson of course -- a great baseball story but a good tough American tale as well. ""42"" the ambitious new biopic about Robinson is better written and produced than those childrens books but it isnt any deeper and thats a disappointment. How severe a disappointment will depend on whether you like your inspirational legends served with all the trimmings -- swelling soundtrack music men rounding third in slow-motion little boys looking on in awe -- or prefer your heroes life-size the better to honestly depict their triumphs. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters The films handsomely mounted and great to look at and it gets the basics right including the action on the field. (To me anyway; the guys over in the sports section might differ.) Writer-director Brian Helgeland -- he wrote the scripts for ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mystic River"" -- approaches the story of the first man to break baseballs color barrier with reverence for the legend and respect for the period. If you want a crowd-pleaser that confirms your belief in Americas steady pre-ordained progression away from racism this will do fine. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below As Robinson newcomer Chadwick Boseman is also fine a physical ringer for the player and an actor capable of hitting the scripts slow floaters. His Jackie is as complex as ""42"" allows him to be a man proud of himself and his abilities but forced to swallow that pride for the greater good (of his race of baseball of American society -- take your pick). The film opens in 1945 as Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) announces to his stunned staff that a Negro ballplayer will be brought up through the farm system into the big leagues. ""Why me?"" Robinson asks Rickey throughout ""42"" and its a fair question the movie never really answers. Ford gives a juicy two-dimensional hambone of a character performance -- hes an enjoyable cartoon -- but he convinces you that Rickey is acting both out of greed (all those African-American ticket sales) and contrarian Methodist principles. Still why Robinson? Why not Roy Campanella or Larry Doby? To press too far into such questions is to go against the heroic narrative so the movie doesnt. After the legendary exchange between Robinson and Rickey herein enshrined -- ""You want a player that doesnt have the guts to fight back?"" ""No I want a player whos got the guts not to fight back"" -- ""42"" sends the player to the Triple-A Montreal Royals before bringing him to Ebbets Field home of the beloved Bums. Jackies accompanied by his wife Rachel (a delightful Nicole Beharie) and black sportswriter Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) -- the new stars appointed Boswell -- but most of the films drama takes place on the field in the stands and in the locker room. Helgeland understands that when all is said and done this is less the story of one African-American athlete than of the immense perceptual shift white America had to make to accommodate him. (Thats why ""42"" is nothing like ""The Help"" a movie that turns a white Southern woman into a hero of the Civil Rights era.) Robinson is surrounded by concentric rings of embedded prejudice. In the Dodgers clubhouse the debate is primarily between Brad Beyers snake-eyed Kirby Higby and Lucas Blacks supportive Pee Wee Reese with Eddie Stanky (Jesse Luken) Ralph Branca (Hamish Linklater very funny) and Dixie Walker (Ryan Merriman) on various points of the graph. Beyond that are the other teams of the National League all hostile to Rickeys experiment. In the film baserunner Enos Slaughter spikes Robinson (did happen) and pitcher Fritz Ostermuller hits him in the head (didnt). Late in ""42"" the great gray-eyed character actor Alan Tudyk turns the Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman into a figure of absurdist villainy hopping up and down on the baseline and screaming every vicious slur in the playbook. And then there are the fans a sea of reddened faces choking on what they see. In a heavyhanded but effective moment ""42"" shows a little boy (Henry Friedman) in the stands with his dad (Holden Hansen); theyre sharing a classic Norman Rockwell moment that turns sour when the father calls Robinson the N-word and the son after a pause joins in. Thats where the conflict is in this movie not in a groundbreaking baseball player doing his best to keep his emotions in check. The bottom line is this Any version of the Jackie Robinson story that renders the African-American characters generic while fleshing out the whites is just missing the point. ""42"" does give Robinson one scene where he gets to rage unseen in an Ebbets Field walkway. Then it brings on Rickey for a paternal shoulder-pat in silhouette. The film rushes up to the 1947 World Series and stops short since losing is not what the films about. Helgeland fills the edges with pleasurable bits (Christopher Meloni as a swaggering Leo Durocher; John C. McGinley just aces as sportscaster Red Barber coming up with laconic poetry on the fly) but he fills the center with hollow Hollywood pageantry. Mark Ishams score is a particular offender -- canned-corn Americana -- and its cranked up high so well know what to feel at every conceivable moment. In the end ""42"" lets us hear from everybody but the man himself. Back in the 1990s Spike Lee unsuccessfully tried to get a version of this tale to the screen with Denzel Washington in the lead; it might have ticked off a lot of people while getting closer to Robinsons own experiences. As others have pointed out a simple dip into the players 1972 memoirs ""I Never Had It Made"" reveals a prouder pricklier more clear-eyed and complicated man than Helgeland allows. But thats not what pageantrys for. ""42"" is a soothing epic of mainstream social progress -- a parade with a saintly blur at its head. Its a childrens movie when the point about Robinson is that he came along at a time when baseball fans and white America were ready at last to eventually act like grown-ups.

RELATED NEWS Interview Harrison Ford talks 42 By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Apr 10 2013 227 PM There are plenty of scenes depicting the explicit horrors of racism that Jackie Robinson faced in ""42"" Brian Helgelands film about Robinson becoming the first African-American to play major-league baseball. A redneck manager hurls a shocking never-ending stream of N-word-laced invective as Robinson bats every time he bats. A Philadelphia hotel turns away not just Robinson but the entire Brooklyn Dodgers team because of the color of Robinsons skin. In the minor leagues down South a police officer runs Robinson off the field saying that mixed-race baseball is against the law. These scenes are effective in Helgelands hands but really how could they not be? These acts are offensive on their face difficult to wrap your head around and meant to be so. But there is a quieter scene even more powerful in its illustration of how scary Robinsons road was in which Robinson played by Chadwick Boseman doesnt even appear. It takes place in the office of Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) the Dodgers executive who signed Robinson. Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) walks in and tells Rickey hed like to sit out the series against Cincinnati. Hes from nearby Kentucky and hes gotten a letter disparaging him for playing with Robinson. Rickey chortles then reaches into a filing cabinet and pulls out three overstuffed files. They contain threats against Robinson against his life against the life of his wife and child. They are ugly shocking dangerous. Does Robinson know Reese asks? ""Of course"" Rickey says almost chuckling. The FBI knows about them too. Yet Robinson would play at a level high enough to lead the Dodgers to the World Series and be named rookie of the year. This then is the true price the pioneer pays. Yet Robinson was able to get past it. (Reese not only played but paused at first base to sling his arm around Robinson enraging the hometown bigots.) Helgelands film is admirable in many ways. For one thing it avoids turning Rickey into the Great White Hero who revolutionized the game singlehandedly. Rickey is portrayed positively to be sure and why not? It helps that Ford sinks his teeth into the best role hes had in years. But Robinson is the real hero here of course and Helgeland never depicts him as otherwise. What the film could use is a little more of the subtlety we see in the scene in Rickeys office. Helgeland hits nearly every nail square on the head telling the story in stark black and white when it would have benefited from more shades of gray. Robinson makes by my count two outs in the entire film and both are used as plot devices. Yes he was a great player who enjoyed an outstanding season and we dont expect to see every pop fly or strikeout. But the one place the Robinson in ""42"" never finds struggle is on the field. He would become a Hall of Fame player but surely he was not the near-perfect player in every game he played in as is suggested here. Of course this could be a matter of looking at the ""Mona Lisa"" and complaining about the frame. Robinsons achievement is impossible to overstate. He didnt just integrate baseball. He made huge strides for equality in all sports and by extension society. He is one of the central figures of the 20th century. But you cant watch ""42"" without feeling as if were seeing the obvious in terms of both struggle and triumph and not a lot more. What else was going on in Robinsons life and more important his head? Reese grew from silent to supportive (Black is excellent in a limited role). Was there more to that transition? One assumes. Helgeland has given us an impressive introduction to one of the most important men in U.S. history. But you cant help wanting more. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr FORTY TWO Chadwick Boseman plays the iconic Jackie Robinson in this stellar biopic B+ 42 Genre Drama; Starring Nicole Beharie Chadwick Boseman Harrison Ford Christopher Meloni; Director Brian Helgeland; Release Date Wide 04/12/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 128; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 29 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT These days there are many less flattering things you could say about a movie than that its enjoyable in a square uncomplicated stirringly old-fashioned way. 42 a sports drama about how Jackie Robinson broke the color line in professional baseball is in some ways a film that could have been made 30 years ago or 50 years ago. (In fact it was made 63 years ago 1950s The Jackie Robinson Story starred the legendary second baseman himself.) The film depicts Robinson played by the dazzling little-known actor Chadwick Boseman as a fearless noble athlete-crusader -- which of course is just what he was though 42 scarcely spends three minutes trying to find any flaws in him (surely he must have had one) or even giving him a sprinkle of idiosyncrasy. Is the writer-director Brian Helgeland (who wrote L.A. Confidential and directed A Knights Tale) worried that we wouldnt admire Robinson enough? Helgeland works in what I think of as a conservative -- or maybe its just really really basic -- neoclassical Hollywood style spelling everything out letting the story unfold in a plainspoken and deliberate fashion with a big wide open pictorial camera eye. Its like the latter-day Clint Eastwood style applied to material thats as traditional as can be. Yet in one vital way the movie feels very contemporary. When Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 spearheading the civil rights era before it had a name he was subjected on and off the field to a degree of racial antagonism that could almost be called terrorism. For all its wholesomely uplifting message-movie design 42 makes that struggle look every bit as brutal and scary as it was. Robinsons fellow Dodgers many of them Southern boys welcome him to the team by signing a petition to have him kicked off. Hes booed from the stands pitchers take open delight in beaning him and in one scene when hes up at bat the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies (Alan Tudyk) heckles him from the sidelines by calling him the N-word for five unrelenting minutes. The way that scene goes on and on is scathingly powerful as Jackie can barely keep himself from coming apart. Boseman a graceful and handsome actor with a deep inner fire gives Robinson a stare thats penetrating and guarded at the same time. A lot of the films drama is reading that face -- the intelligence and masked outrage. Jackie isnt allowed to fight back against any of the viciousness (if he did it would look to mainstream America like he was the troublemaker) yet swallowing it eats up his spirit. How does he cope? By playing the hell out of the game. Even if he hadnt been baseballs trailblazing crossover star Robinson had a talent on the field that was explosive. He was a wizard at stealing bases and the movie glories in his quickness and bravado -- how he steps off first base and eases down the path hopping back and forth like a jackrabbit on a hot stove holding his arms low letting his fingers wiggle like nervous antennae. 42 portrays this athletic showmanship with an element of racial psychodrama. Robinson isnt just teasing the pitchers (the more they look at him the less they can tell what hes going to do next). Hes mocking them working off his anger. He triumphs and holds on to his sanity by beating racist players at their own game. The movie covers just three years of Robinsons life beginning in 1945 when hes a World War II veteran playing in the Negro Leagues and gets recruited by the forward-thinking Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey to join his minor-league club the Montreal Royals. As Rickey a stogie-chomping grump with a heart of gold Harrison Ford seems to have reinvented himself as an actor. He gives an ingeniously stylized cartoon performance his eyes atwinkle his mouth a rubbery grin his voice all wily Southern music though with that growl of Fordian anger just beneath it. Calling Robinson into his office he tells him that he needs a player who doesnt so much have the guts to fight back as the guts not to fight back. 42 is a rousing tribute to how impossible and therefore heroic a stance that was.

Share Tweet The Jackie Robinson biopic 42 operates in a box inside of a box--and not the batters box either because that would imply it has some freedom to swing away. Its thoroughly embalmed in the glossy lacquer of conventional baseball movies and limited further by trying to deal with the horrors of racism in that context. Written and directed by Brian Helgeland whose credits range from scripting L.A. Confidential to directing Payback and A Knights Tale the film functions as a tribute to Robinsons courage and dignity and its often stirring in that capacity. But it approaches him more as legend than man muting the truly dangerous and menacing circumstances under which Robinson broke the color barrier and excelled as a major-league ballplayer. No true Jackie Robinson biopic would be rated PG-13. The casting helps. Wisely choosing to skip a more established name and find the right man for the part the filmmakers found Chadwick Boseman a TV and film bit player with an athletes frame and a quiet way of imposing his will that feels right. Robinson had to be sensitive to the politics surrounding his ascension and Boseman projects the discipline necessary to do it without compromise. Harrison Ford on the other hand barks like a junkyard dog as Branch Rickey the Brooklyn Dodgers executive who broke the color barrier when he signed Robinson then a star shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues to play for the team in 1945. Robinson brings Rachel Isum (Nicole Beharie) his future wife along with him as he develops with the Montreal Royals farm club before making the bigs in 1947. Theres adversity A gas attendant refuses to let Robinson and his Negro-league teammates use the non-colored bathroom a Philadelphia hotel wont allow him to stay overnight on a road trip coaches and teammates shun him on the field and in the locker room and fans festoon the Dodgers front office with hate mail and death threats. Then theres the overcoming of adversity through Robinsons inspired play and his ability to transcend confrontations that would fell weaker men. Its impossible not to be moved by Robinsons story even in the broad strokes painted by Helgeland here but 42 feels like its ducking out of the conversation its purporting to start. Its a post-racial movie about a racist world. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review To The Wonder Next Movie Review Antiviral Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Despite public insults death threats and entrenched racism even within his own team Robinson maintained a Gandhi-esque calm keeping his fists around his bat and consistently playing his best. He would become Rookie of the Year an MVP and an All-Star. In 1997 Major League Baseball permanently retired his uniform number 42 to honor his achievements. Even non-fans know the general outline of Robinsons story. Does ""42"" have anything more to add? Writer-director Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") deserves credit for saluting Rickey as the man who put Robinson on the diamond but this big-budget period piece is more concerned with burnishing a legend than dramatizing a life. Characters repeatedly invoke Robinsons historical impact as if his history had already been made. ""Im gonna be your Boswell"" says reporter Wendell Smith (Andre Holland). Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) suggests ""Maybe tomorrow well all wear 42"" foretelling the commemorative day in 2004 when just such a thing would happen. Newsday42 movie times Only Robinson played by a likable but bland Chadwick Boseman seems unaware of his significance. This may be intended to convey modesty but it comes off as indifference. During some of Robinsons landmark victories for integration -- a gracious photo with race-baiting Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) an on-field display of affection from Kentucky-born Reese -- Boseman looks merely bemused even slightly bored. advertisement | advertise on newsday Bolstering the film is a fine support cast led by a cigar-chomping Ford but including John C.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> No one argues that Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson could slide into a base like a man on fire. It was a bitch to tag him out. 42 the film that details Robinsons groundbreaking start as the first African-American since the 1880s to cross major league baseballs color line would be easy to tag out as a tear-jerking civics lesson like The Blind Side. But writer-director Brian Helgeland touches home on the storys sheer emotional velocity. 42 named for the jersey number Robinson wore for the Brooklyn Dodgers when he joined them in 1947 lives up to its subtitle The True Story of an American Legend. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Playing a legend can be hell on an actor trying to stay both reverent and real. No. 42 portrayed himself in 1950s The Jackie Robinson Story and barely skimmed the surface. 42 which dodges biopic cliches by focusing only on that first season picks a winner in Chadwick Boseman who has credits in film (The Express) and TV (Lincoln Heights) and deeper roots in theater as a playwright director and actor. Boseman shrewdly eases into the role showing the contained cautious outsider in Robinson as he enters the racist world of white baseball. Harrison Ford hams it up with gusto as Branch Rickey the general manager of the Dodgers. It wasnt idealism alone that spurred Rickey to sign Robinson to a farm team in 1945. He saw dollar signs if he could successfully integrate baseball. But he couldnt afford a hothead pioneer. Cigar in hand Rickey tells Robinson ""I want a player whos got the guts not to fight back."" Rickey sics Dodgers manager Leo Durocher (a superb Christopher Meloni) on players who sign a petition protesting Robinson. But 42 is out there alone. The dramatic tension comes in watching him not go medieval on the ass of bigots notably Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) who uses the n-word with a frequency unheard since Django Unchained. Bosemans eyes burn with 42s inner torment. He damn near loses it when slurs are hurled at his devoted wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie). Alone with Rickey he shatters a bat against a stadium wall. Its a shameful chapter in sports history and 42 honors Robinsons resistance. Sweet revenge comes on the field as 42 shows up the jerks by playing killer baseball diving for a line drive or stealing a base fi st raised. Corny? You bet. Also inspiring. Is that enough? Given Helgelands rep as a screenwriter (including an Oscar for 1997s L.A. Confidential) it rankles that 42 settles for the o fficial story. The private Robinson who died of a heart attack at 53 in 1972 stays private. We stay on the outside looking in. Let it be. At the top of a new baseball season its hard not to root for a movie thats in it for the love of the game.

He made it clear that at the start of the following season he had every intention of promoting Robinson to the Dodgers. Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson in a scene from ""42."" (D. Stevens/Warner Bros. Pictures) Rickey was breaking the color line that had existed unofficially in Major League Baseball since the 1880s. And he had chosen Robinson to do it because he thought the young athlete had the makeup to take the taunts insults and threats that would certainly greet him -- without responding.""Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?"" Robinson asked Rickey when they first met. No Rickey responded ""I want a player with enough guts not to fight back.""That scene happens early on in ""42"" a modern take on Robinsons rise to the big leagues and his first tumultuous year with the Dodgers. ""42"" is far from a perfect film but it has a keen sense of the era oozes a passion for the topic and largely gets the details right. It is an entertaining bit of filmmaking that admirably achieves its goal of capturing Robinsons heroic struggle against the racism of the national pastime.Advertisement The film is at its very best early on as writer-director Brian Helgeland (best known for his writing work on ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mystic River"") creates a nuanced portrait of America right after World War II. In a series of set pieces that are notable for their visual style and production values he shows what life was like in the Negro Leagues (particularly in the South) and in the hardscrabble world of Major League Baseball where even the top players were lucky to make 1000 a month.In many ways ""42"" is as much Rickeys story as Robinsons and Harrison Ford gives his best performance in some time as the general manager. He brings to a life a man who for all his idealism and Methodist principles saw the economic benefits of bringing the first black player to the majors. Money would also play a major role in the eventual acceptance of Robinson by such teammates as Pee Wee Reese (a sharp performance by Lucas Black) and Eddie Stanky. In one of the films best scenes Dodgers manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni of ""Law amp; Order Special Victims Unit"" in a terrific bit) tells players who are threatening not to play if Robinson joins the team ""I dont care if the guy is yellow or black or if he has stripes like a zebra. ... Whats more I say he can make us all rich.""As Robinson Chadwick Boseman -- a relatively unknown TV and theater actor -- has the unenviable task of bringing humanity to a fierce proud man who has become something of a mythical figure. Boseman manages to convey a good deal of Robinsons complex nature and also looks fine in the baseball scenes. In that first season Robinson was able to remain under control in the face of abuse and discrimination that may be startling for modern audiences. (When Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) flings invective after invective at the young player it is a cringe-worthy moment but one that illuminates what Robinson went through.) And in what is the climax of the film he helps to drive the Dodgers to the World Series (the Bums lose to the Yankees in seven games but thats not part of the movie). Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson right and Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey in a scene from ""42."" (D. Stevens/Warner Bros. Pictures) ""42"" does have flaws. It feels forced toward the end as Helgeland struggles to fit history into a neat ending. While its accurate in what it presents it doesnt include all the facets of the story particularly the resentment toward Robinson from the big names in the Negro Leagues who felt -- accurately -- that he wasnt the best player and shouldnt get the first shot.Helgelands script also fails to bring such intriguing figures as black baseball writer Wendell Smith and Montreal manager Clay Hopper to life and Mark Ishams self-consciously uplifting score is more distracting than effective.Still the story of Jackie Robinson is so inspiring after all these years that it more than survives the shortcomings of ""42."" If you want a sense of a true all-American hero this film is a fine place to start. Lucas Black as Pee Wee Reese and Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson in ""42"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release.

Its a perfectly unexceptional but slickly made sincerely acted often entertaining sometimes manipulative and always watchable blend of action on the diamond and bravery behind the scenes that will please baseball fanatics more than movie historians. Its a good enough biopic to make you wish it were a better motion picture. If writer-director Brian Helgeland had never done anything more than win a Best Screenplay Oscar for writing the great L.A. Confidential he would be a permanent fixture in my own personal Hall of Fame. With 42 he expands his skills to turn a mountain of research into a cogent life story worth retelling. Its not only about a little black boy from a family of Georgia sharecroppers who grew up to be the first African-American player in Major League Baseball played with dignity and elegance by Chadwick Boseman but also about Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford as youve never seen him before) the scrappy revolutionary general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers who followed his heart and signed up the unknown first baseman in 1947 ending baseballs infamous ""color line"" for the first time in 60 years and taking a stand against prejudice that changed the history of the Greatest American Pastime forever. Easy? It was a road paved with the razor blades of hate that only a pair of color-blind mules could have survived without permanent injury. Its a heck of a story but not the only one. They called Hank Greenberg a ""kike"" and Joe DiMaggio a ""wop."" But somehow the N-word has an uglier ring that still resonates. 42 is less about the career that catapulted Jackie Robinson to fame and more about the hurdles that knocked him down along the way. Visit the Baseball Hall of Fame if you want to learn about the awards the magazine covers the stolen bases the 137 home runs and how he helped the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the 1955 World Series one year before he retired from the sport forever. It makes a better movie to catalog the insults and jeers from the spectators the press and his own teammates at a time when there were 16 Major League teams and every player was white. Rickey broke the rules but he demanded a black player who had the guts never to fight back lose his cool or act like anything less than a gentleman. Jackies motto was ""God built me to last"" but to the other players he was a punching bag ready to snap. Leading the league and three wins away from the pennant he was still getting beaned in the head by racist pitchers. The Dodgers were in a dogfight for first place before he would even take a shower with the rest of the team. He was the butt of an avalanche of cliches and Mr. Helgeland seems to have collected them all. Why did you do it he asks Rickey who says floridly ""We won over fascism in Germany. Its time we won over racism at home."" Reports differ as to just how liberal Branch Rickey really was; he may have just wanted the best team he could assemble. And theres not a word about how Robinson whose career only lasted 10 years later turned into a radical Republican and a big supporter of Richard Nixon. On film theyre both saints. The salient facts in 42 are warmed over from The Jackie Robinson Story the 1950 film in which he played himself--with surprising naturalism and force. You get the nasty Dodgers petition scene in which they actually tried to force management to throw him off the team and I dare you to fight back a tear or two when the other players finally come around to embrace and respect their black teammate as a human being. The sentiments are inflated and the heroics glorified. You boo the same hecklers especially Alan Tudyk in a great performance as notoriously bigoted redneck Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman who taunted Jewish players with Nazi salutes and verbally abused Robinson on the field with loud racial epithets. And you cheer the same trailblazing notables--Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) Ralph Branca (Hamish Linklater) rough guy Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni). I liked them all. Among the films virtues I also liked lovely Nicole Beharie as Jackies wife Rachel the camerawork by ace cinematographer Don (Forrest Gump) Burgess and the wonderful period source music by Billie Holiday Artie Shaw and Count Basie. The theme expressed in a gruff solid performance by Harrison Ford is that a man who can play ball should not be kept out of the profession because of his color or race. Cant quarrel with that. As every baseball fan knows 42 was the number on Jackie Robinsons uniform from the day he joined the Dodgers on April 15 1947. It was officially retired in 1997 in memoriam never to be used again--except every April 15 when every player on every team in baseball wears the number 42 in his honor. Id say he beat the odds and made baseball history big time wouldnt you? rreedobserver.com 42 Written by Brian Helgeland Directed by Brian Helgeland Starring Chadwick Boseman T.R.

A too self-consciously inspiring rendition of Jackie Robinsons genuinely inspiring accomplishment of breaking baseballs color barrier. TWITTER Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford provide engaging performances as Jackie Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey in the Legendary/Warner Bros. drama about the man who broke MLBs color line. Pretty when it should be gritty and grandiosely noble instead of just telling it like it was 42 needlessly trumps up but still cant entirely spoil one of the great American 20th century true-life stories the breaking of major league baseballs color line by Jackie Robinson. Whether in the deep South or the streets of Brooklyn life here looks spiffy and well-scrubbed enough to appear in a department store window while the soaring musical accompaniment seems to be stamping all the protagonists passports for immediate admission to that great ballpark in the sky. All the same lead actors Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford cut through the artifice with engaging performances as Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey respectively and audiences who dont know much about the first black man to play professional baseball will be suitably impressed. Hit-starved Warner Bros. should be able to stir moderately good attendance domestically although foreign prospects as always with baseball yarns are slight. PHOTOS Take Me Out Hollywoods Best Baseball Movies The key scene in 42 just as it was in the low-budget 1950 The Jackie Robinson Story which starred the ballplayer himself comes when Rickey warning his prospect about the abuse that inevitably awaits him demands to know if hes ""got enough guts not to fight back"" when provoked by other players or fans. Robinson was not the best player in the Negro Leagues but he was reckoned to be the one who might best withstand the trial by fire posed by teammates who didnt want to play with him and a society that often wouldnt allow him to travel eat or lodge with the rest of the team. Needing a manageable window through which to dramatize a sports breakthrough fraught with racial social political and attitudinal meaning this pet project of writer-director Brian Helgeland and producer Thomas Tull zeroes in on the years 1945-47 concluding with Robinsons first year in the majors. Although there is quick mention of a sports career at UCLA (which the film does not note had the most integrated sports program of any school in the U.S. at the time) and a quick temper that earned him an Army court-martial the 26-year-old member of the American Negro League Kansas City Monarchs seems like the picture of rectitude a well-spoken young man with a lovely wife-to-be Rachel (Nicole Beharie) and none of the wild traits of some of his teammates. PHOTOS The Faces of The Dodgers The New Blood and the Stalwarts A religious man anxious to win as well as to integrate the league Rickey first assigns Robinson to the Montreal Royals farm team. Spring training in Florida is no picnic; his manager and other players shun him hes unwelcome at the team hotel forcing him to stay in a private home with a black family and a good ol boy drives by to warn that some fellas will be coming by to ""do something"" about him. As Rickey has insisted Robinson must speak only with his actions on the field of play and so he does hitting a homer on opening day in Jersey City an accomplishment boldfaced and underlined by a script that insists upon having his manager then comment ""He might be superhuman after all."" This is typical of the hyperbole and unnecessary inflation that infects the film as a whole. Rather than letting its heros accomplishments and behavior speak for themselves Helgeland hammers home every achievement and then puts a halo around it as if anyone wont get it otherwise. The racist resistance Robinson confronted is pungently presented especially in scenes of white Dodger teammates preparing a petition refusing to play with a black man and of Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) relentlessly taunting Robinson in the batters box with the n-word and every other epithet he can summon. But these moments are almost invariably followed by immediate comeuppance for the perpetrators and victory for the stoical athlete who receives reliable support not only from Rickey but from manager Leo Durocher (a live-wire Christopher Meloni) and fellow players like shortstop Pee Wee Reese (a very good Lucas Black) and pitcher Ralph Branca (Hamish Linklater) who in a tricky scene convinces his reluctant black friend that he should shower with the rest of the team. 42 which takes its title from its subjects uniform number (subsequently retired by all major league teams) gets into its best groove once Robinson after one season in the minors makes his big-league debut on April 15 1947 at Brooklyns Ebbets Field. Forced to play at the unfamiliar position of first base Robinson inspires a wide range of reactions embrace by black fans skepticism from reporters and viciousness on the part of some opponents who deliberately throw at him roughly slide into him and otherwise try to take him out of the game. For his part Robinson provides excitement with his daring base running and powerful hitting which help the Dodgers in his debut season turn the tables on the previous years National League pennant winners the St. Louis Cardinals by finishing in first place. In the bargain Robinson becomes the first recipient of a new baseball honor by being voted rookie of the year. Isnt this victory enough without all the triumphant blarings of Mark Ishams mawkishly inspiring score and such bogus sights as Pittsburgh fans cheering when Robinson helps the Dodgers clinch the pennant while playing the Pirates? The film is so averse to bad news that it avoids mentioning that the Dodgers then lost the World Series to the Yankees. VIDEO 42 Trailer Teases Jackie Robinsons Historic Journey On the other hand now-vanished stadiums including those in Philadelphia and Cincinnati as well as the Polo Grounds in the Bronx and Brooklyns own Ebbets Field have been re-created more convincingly than in any previous films thanks to CGI adornments made to old Engel Stadium in Chattanooga. Other stadiums in the South were used for various spring training and Negro League games. A real affection for baseball and everything to do with it palpably permeates the film. Its a strange thing to say but its true that Boseman is considerably more convincing playing Robinson than Robinson himself was in the 1950 film; when actors are sometimes derided for ""just"" playing themselves theres no recognition that this can be harder than it looks. Untrained and a bit shy in front of the camera Robinson was pleasant enough but never forceful or dramatic. Sporting a charming lopsided smile Boseman has the necessary appeal proves convincing as an athlete and is expressive in spite of the fact that the man hes playing must mostly keep his true feelings bottled up. For a long time Robinson has no one to confide in except his wife whos often not around and the sense persists that an opportunity was missed by not building up their relationship with more depth and complexity. By contrast its OK that Rickey in Helgelands script is a one-dimensional role; the whole man is not needed just the committed integrationist and smart executive who knows just how to advise Robinson and keep him from exploding or imploding during the self-described ""noble experiment."" Fords engaging performance is part-caricature and part-ingratiating father figure who knows just what to say in any crisis. A particularly eye-and-ear-catching turn is given by John C. McGinley as the Dodgerss legendary radio announcer Red Barber. As one of the last centurys most inspiring and literally game-changing personal sagas Jackie Robinsons life can hardly help but be stirring and will no doubt impress many younger viewers some of whom may be completely unfamiliar with his story. Its just too bad that Helgeland cant go for broke and get his uniform as dirty as Jackie Robinson used to do.

Thick with canned inspirationalism and heroic platitudes but only occasionally pushing past the iconic to grapple with the real human drama of Robinsons life this personal passion project for Legendary Pictures chairman-CEO Thomas Tull should enjoy a decent first inning with audiences but wont surpass Robinsons famed jersey number in box office millions. Robinson also wrote in his memoir that even two decades on from his historic achievements on the baseball diamond he couldnt bring himself to salute the American flag or stand for the National Anthem knowing that he remained ""a black man in a white world."" So it comes as no real surprise that a film of Robinsons struggle was long pursued by two directors with a keen feel for the underside of the American dream Spike Lee and Robert Redford (who envisioned himself in the role of Robinsons impresario Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey here played by Harrison Ford). The ""42"" of writer-director Brian Helgeland by contrast remains largely on the surface of things pitting its Robinson (relative newcomer Chadwick Boseman) against a succession of cartoonish racists and Southern good-old-boys who are either softened by the first basemans towering nobility or completely drowned out by composer Mark Ishams incessant fanfares. That Robinson emerged as a divisive figure in a Jim Crow America -- where even some supposedly progressive northerners felt there were clear limits on what a black man could hope to achieve -- is something only fitfully acknowledged by Helgelands film which instead traffics in carefully delineated heroes and villains of the sort one might find in a comicbook treatment of Robinsons life (one of which was actually printed in the 1950s). The first hour in particular rarely stops reaching for the mythic as it depicts Robinsons rise from the Negro League Kansas City Monarchs to the Dodgers triple-A Montreal farm team and finally in 1947 to Ebbets Field itself -- all part of Rickeys ""noble experiment"" to integrate Major League ball. Boseman who bears a striking resemblance to the real Robinson has an innately appealing screen presence and a wide beaming smile but can do only so much with a part that asks him to act impervious or indignant but rarely anything in-between. A far greater gamble comes in the casting of Ford who has never before attempted this sort of ""character"" turn appearing under heavy makeup and padding as the avuncular Rickey and donning a vocal inflection somewhere in the neighborhood of W.C. Fields. Its a big boisterous performance that verges on caricature at times but ultimately captures the spirit of a man given to self-dramatizing airs and guided by a sense of his place in history. By any measure its one of the few legitimate risks in a movie otherwise averse to taking them. ""42"" improves slightly in its second half which focuses on Robinsons rookie season with the Dodgers and benefits from the lively presence of John C. McGinley as legendary Dodgers play-by-play commentator Red Barber whose wry observations help to energize the films enervating pace. In the most affecting episode lifted more or less verbatim from his own account Robinson is mercilessly taunted with racial epithets by Phillies manager Ben Chapman (well played by Alan Tudyk) during an away game in the ""city of brotherly love"" all the while managing to maintain his famous cool. But Robinsons Herculean suppression of temper took a heavy toll on his psyche (Hank Aaron was among those who speculated it may have contributed to Robinsons death at the age of 53) a simmering inner tension carefully elided from this telling of the tale. Helgeland a fine screenwriter (""L.A. Confidential"" ""Mystic River"") with a patchy career as a director doesnt even try for any of the irreverent stylistic touches here that he brought to his earlier ""Payback"" and ""A Knights Tale"" framing the action in the same unwavering procession of medium shots and closeups whether were on the field in the dugout or in the locker room. Shot by regular Robert Zemeckis collaborator Don Burgess the images have the overly lit diffuse halo effect that seemed to attend Redford every time he stepped up to plate in ""The Natural"" while the entire movie bears the too-new look of certain period films with every freshly pressed costume and vintage automobile gleaming like it just came off the assembly line. A movie about Robinson isnt obliged to be dark or edgy but for all of ""42s"" self-conscious monument building the cumulative effect is to render its subject markedly smaller and more ordinary than he actually was. A handful of familiar faces dot the ""42"" infield including Christopher Meloni as the cantankerous Leo Durocher though only Lucas Black as legendary shortstop (and Robinson confident) Pee Wee Reese registers with anything more than trading-card depth. 42 Reviewed at Warner Bros. screening room New York April 3 2013.

I think it was more entertaining than your review reports. And a lot of what you say is wrong with the movie is just what is wrong with America and its racist ideas and behavior.

Reply Ray says April 13 2013 at 924 pm The movie stunk a lot of fabrication if you want to see how it really was find the original ""Jackie Robinson Story"" on DVD. Robinson plays himself and the movie is far better than this waste of film. Reply Anonymous says April 9 2013 at 1025 pm Will absolutely end up grossing over 42 mil. Reply Irv slifkin says April 10 2013 at 716 am You state Robinson was a first baseman but he played 2nd base usually. Reply Elroy Shomer says April 10 2013 at 1038 am Yeah they specifically put him at first during his rookie year so he wouldnt get spiked at 2nd. Great story about that and the 1st-baseman who lost his job to the experiment in ""The Brooklyn Dodgers in Cuba."" Jon Weisman says April 10 2013 at 923 am In 1947 the year the movie is focused on Robinson played exclusively at first base.
