Suzanne Hanover/Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption Suzanne Hanover/Universal Studios Katherine Heigl Leslie Mann Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd consider the consequences of love (and marriage) in Knocked Up. Suzanne Hanover/Universal Studios Watch Knocked Up Clips Imagine a 20-something Wendy and Peter Pan and youve got the leads of Knocked Up Shes practical hes flighty; shes mature hes an overgrown kid. Shes got family hes living in a suburban clubhouse with a bunch of stoner-buddy ""lost boys."" And like those buddies he hasnt grown up. So one night these two -- here named Alison and Ben -- meet at a neighborhood bar and after a lot of alcohol and a long night of partying he gets really lucky. She gets waaaay less lucky though she doesnt discover that until eight weeks later with the help of a pregnancy test. So Alison gets back in touch with Ben just to talk. Again Ben feels lucky at least before she tells him hes going to be a dad; again Alison feels less so as she learns among other things that Bens living here illegally (hes Canadian) has no real job and has a grand total of about 900 in the bank. Which he figures will last him at least two years. The thing is hes trying to sound impressive. Now writer-director Judd Apatow has been establishing himself lately as king of the dirty-minded-but-sweet relationship comedy and hes worked some neat variations on it here. Not just the Peter Pan thing upended by parenthood but a whole theory about how men and women approach relationships and what that does to them when they get to marriage. Alisons brother-in-law is succinct on the subject ""Marriage is like an unfunny tense version of Everybody Loves Raymond but it doesnt last 22 minutes. It lasts forever."" Small wonder Ben doesnt want to leap right into fatherhood. The mix of meanness and wistfulness in that line is an Apatow trademark; its delivered here by Paul Rudd one of a bunch of very funny actors who are starting to seem like the directors personal repertory company. Seth Rogen for instance who plays Ben has been pretty hilarious in Apatow comedies stretching from The 40-Year-Old Virgin all the way back to TVs Freaks and Geeks. Finally given the lead role here Rogen is scruffy and vulnerable and appealing enough to persuade you that Katherine Heigls forthright Alison might conceivably give him a tumble after a drink. Or maybe 12. Which is good because despite its R rating and its drug references and its crude language and its delivery-room shots of a baby crowning -- the last has to be a first in a mainstream movie -- Knocked Up isnt as outrageous as it is human. Its a morality tale about the importance of growing up not just growing older. And what sets it apart from the soulless laugh-fests that usually pass for comedy in Hollywood is that at heart Knocked Up has heart.

Well who doesnt? And so when slacker Ben (Seth Rogen) thinks Alison (Katherine Heigl) the hot aspiring TV presenter hes somehow picked up at a club tells him not to bother with a condom he doesnt. The results of this sozzled cock-up are an unwelcome pregnancy and the years best comedy; one that confirms the arrival of an extended group of talent that looks set to take the studio comedy crown from the likes of Ferrell Stiller and Carrey and deserves to.Like Judd Apatows directorial debut The 40-Year-Old Virgin Knocked Up takes a subject ripe for bawdy knockabout delivers that with aplomb - here we get top gags about sneaking a peek at the gynaecologists sex during pregnancy and crowning - but also offers a raft of nuanced credible and moving relationships between a group of sympathetic imperfect characters. Here we get Bens stoner roommates whose pastimes include working on a celebrity skin website and not shaving for a year and Alisons sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) whose marriage to Pete (Paul Rudd) offers salutary lessons on the ups and downs of shotgun matrimony a decade on.Long rehearsals and plentiful improvisation are the trademarks of Apatows approach and his well-established ensemble delivers not only killer laughs but also a palpable sense of affection; the family feel is enhanced by the fact that Mann is Apatows wife and Debbies kids their own. Both up-to-the-minute pop culture and Bens Jewishness are also disarmingly mined to impressive effect and Rudds De Niro impression is an absolute hoot.

I wouldnt quite believe slacker Ben and his friends if I havent met people just like them. The side characters are not all that well developed however its seldom that they are; they are funny though and provide some really great moments. The main characters Ben and Alison are better defined and well played which causes the viewer to identify with them and care about their situation.

After reading your review I expected a lot more...and wasted APS6.00 finding out that you were wrong The main characters are totally unbelievable as a couple and there is no chemistry between them at all. The supporting cast of quirky mates looked like a desperate attempt to pad out the poorly develop main characters. For your to suggest that they had long rehearsals is probably funnier than any gag in the film The only funny character is Katherine Heigls female workmate. She only appears in two scenes and steals them both. Dont waste your money on this rubbish.

Apatow Hits Ground Like Sturges Wilder By Andrew Sarris  06/05/07 655pm Knocked Up Running time 129 minutes Written and directed by Judd Apatow Starring Seth Rogen Katherine Heigl Paul Rudd Leslie Mann Judd Apatows Knocked Up from his own screenplay has become the critical sensation movie newsmaker and cocktail-party conversation piece of the season and you should see it by all means if you wish to remain au courant and if for no other reason--though there are more than a few other reasons to check out why Mr. Apatow has hit the ground running with the cognoscenti as few American comedy writer-directors have done since the glory days of Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder in the early 40s. Actually I liked Mr. Apatows Knocked Up much better than I did his earlier success The 40-Year-Old Virgin which I considered to be overrated and a bit mean-spirited besides. But then I may not have been expecting too much the second time around and thereby lowered my sights for Mr. Apatows second foray into once-taboo territory for Hollywood movies. After all was it only 54 years ago that Otto Preminger got into trouble with the Production Code people for leaving the word ""virgin"" in the screenplay by F. Hugh Herbert for The Moon Is Blue (1953) and making a joke about it besides? And heaven knows what these same Production Code people would have said about the use of a vulgarly slangy term for an unanticipated pregnancy as a movie title yet. One American screen taboo that Mr. Apatow does observe however is the refusal to consider seriously the possibility of abortion for an unmarried career woman with potentially a great deal to lose. Even here Mr. Apatow goes sentimentally overboard by sweetening even the awkward duration and body-bloating of pregnancy into a career enhancement for an on-camera TV interviewer. This is not to say that Mr. Apatow fails to get some genuine shock laughs by confronting the rawer aspects of the facts of life and sex in the midst of pregnancy. He also manages to build a credible love story out of a very unlikely one-night stand fueled by alcohol and bedeviled by a misunderstanding about the use (or non-use) of a condom during the frenzied moment of coitus non-interruptus. Chunky and unkempt Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets tall beautiful Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl one of the more conspicuous charmers on Greys Anatomy) in a Los Angeles nightclub where she is celebrating with her upscale married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) her promotion that day to an announcing job at the E cable network which is satirically lightweight in its media pressures from the word go. Ben hangs out with three slacker buddies in a communal apartment masquerading as a nascent Web-site enterprise dedicated to the referencing of nude scenes by name actresses in mainstream movies an idea that is shown to have come and gone before Ben and his buddies can cash in on it. Bens circle of immature friends seems a constant in Mr. Apatows imagination as well as in his lifelong series of collaborations with just about every comedian you can think of. The tapestry of male existence for Mr. Apatow like for so many of his contemporaries is composed of unending bull sessions in which the minutiae of every facet of popular culture are paraded before us for our amusement and complicity. Needless to say women participants are next to nonexistent because their mere presence would put a damper on the festivities. Women just dont play these kinds of games. With this male-chauvinist background it is indeed surprising that Mr. Apatow pays so much thoughtful attention to the actions feelings and motivations of his two major female characters Alison and her disgruntled married sister Debbie. For one thing Alison is never quite sure if she wants to continue her relationship with Ben beyond the birth of her baby. And why should she? He has already told her flat out that he has no job and very little money left over from an accident settlement almost a decade before. But strangely Alison is even less sure that she wants to change Bens bohemian ways and in this reluctance she may be reacting to the troubles in her sisters quarrelsome marriage.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Great comedies work on us the way great dramas do They burrow deep inside planting timed-release capsules of mood and feeling that may self-activate hours or even days later. Writer-director Judd Apatows ""Knocked Up"" is that kind of comedy hilarious from moment to moment but leaving behind both a warm glow and a sting. This is a picture that refuses to fetishize either the ability to conceive or the significance of our place in the universe once weve done so. Theres no self-congratulatory blather about parenthood as a higher calling Apatow -- whose sweet-natured directorial debut ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" became a surprise hit summer before last -- suggests that good parenting with all the flexibility and emotional commitment it demands is as draining as it is enriching. There are no cutesy poo-poo diaper jokes here no insider winking and nudging about how crazy-making our adorable little buggers are and best of all no starry-eyed mooning over the way they bring innocence back into adult lives. I dont know whether to laugh or cry when I think of the moment in ""Knocked Up"" when Paul Rudd as the semi-happily married parent of two supercute but hell-raising little girls muses about how excited they get over simple stuff like blowing bubbles. His delight in their delight gives way to a purely adult brand of melancholy when he says with comically exaggerated moroseness ""Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything."" ""Knocked Up"" isnt just for parents or for prospective parents Its for any of us who have ever had to rise to an occasion only to become paralyzed by fear that were going to come up short -- which should cover just about everybody. It certainly applies to Ben (Seth Rogen) and Alison (Katherine Heigl) who after a drunken one-night stand discover theyve inadvertently made a baby together. Alison is just getting her big break at the E channel where she works Her boss (a slippery-smirky Alan Tudyk of the late great ""Firefly"") has given her the opportunity to be an on-camera interviewer. Ben is a tubby slacker whose four roommates (Jason Segel Jay Baruchel Jonah Hill and Martin Starr each of whom gets the chance to be alternately aggravating and endearing) are also his business partners Theyre working on -- although ""inching toward"" might be the better term -- a Web site that will inform users how far they have to wade into a specific movie to get to the naked girlie parts. Neither Ben nor Alison is ready to become a parent and their fears are only reinforced when they start examining the lives of Alisons sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her husband Pete (Rudd) whose marriage is visibly strained partly -- though not wholly -- by the demands of parenthood. (Their two little girls are played by Iris and Maude Apatow the real-life daughters of the director and Mann who are married.) But for reasons that arent and dont need to be spelled out Alison decides to go ahead with the pregnancy. Ben reluctantly agrees to do his part -- except he has absolutely no idea what his part should be. Its clear that Apatow doesnt intend ""Knocked Up"" as a right-to-life tract and I hope it wont be celebrated -- or decried -- as such. The movie is simply delicate-handed enough to know that neither it nor the Supreme Court can dictate what a womans choice should be. And its intuitive enough to know that such a complicated choice cant be easily explained -- at least in terms that will satisfy anyones politics. At one point Alison and Debbies well-intentioned mother (played by Joanna Kerns) reminds Alison how a friend of the family became pregnant out of wedlock had an abortion and then later went on to have ""a real baby"" -- a pointed reminder that even when were faced with the most intensely personal of decisions theres always going to be someone arrogant enough to think he or she knows whats best for us. Still in an age in which more and more couples wait until their mid-30s or later to have children the mere idea of a woman in her 20s facing an unplanned pregnancy is something of a novelty. Newsstands carry magazines with weird titles like Conceive (whose motto is ""Celebrating the Creation of Families"") and Plum (""The First-Ever Pregnancy Magazine for Women 35 Years and Over""). When conception is harder to achieve a fertilized egg becomes not the first tentative promise of a human being but the Holy Grail a reliquary for our awe and reverence even when it grows up to be an overtired toddler having a temper tantrum in a supermarket. In the bizarro universe of white affluence unplanned pregnancies are what happen to ""other"" people -- this isnt like the old days when babies both the planned and the surprise kind just came along and you somehow dealt with them. And so Apatow uses an unplanned pregnancy -- a jarring event thats also perhaps paradoxically one of the most natural things in the world -- as a device to explore parenthood and the nature of long-term partnership. ""Knocked Up"" isnt at all precious about either At first Alison isnt even so sure she likes Ben. And when she invites him to dinner to break the news (they havent seen each other since the awful morning after that fateful night) he reacts just like the immature stoner bonehead she believes he is. ""I assumed you were wearing a patch -- or a dental dam"" he sputters cruelly suggesting that after all its the womans responsibility to take care of such things. He doesnt even have to know the right words for them. You Might Also Like But Ben is at heart a sweet guy and he and Alison tentatively move toward common ground making the kind of connection that could turn into love. They also fight in ways that bring out the worst in each of them Alison is impatient demanding and judgmental; Ben is a little boy whos reluctant to grow up. The male-female arguments in ""Knocked Up"" are sometimes so vicious so indicative of suppressed toxicity that theyre painful to watch. At one point Debbie advises Alison on how to gain the upper hand with a partner ""You criticize them a lot until they get so down on themselves theyre forced to change."" Her pert cheerful certainty on this matter is what makes the line so funny and also so horrifying. Pete has his own way of dealing with marital pressures. Hes keeping a relatively benign secret from Debbie and when she discovers it she lashes out at him -- and the ensuing confrontation makes you feel horrible for both of them. Apatow has no compunction about going for uncomfortable laughs as well as breezy ones. This is a romantic comedy thats unafraid to face human suffering dead on. And yet in the end its all the more joyous for that. ""Knocked Up"" is a beautifully shaped piece of work There are no slack patches no gratuitous feel-good moments -- if you walk out of ""Knocked Up"" feeling good that means youve earned it. Over the years as both a producer and a director Apatow (who also created the much-loved TV comedies ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"") has assembled a crew of favorite actors. Hes cast many of them in this picture; its clear how attuned they are to his sensibility Rogen is an unlikely romantic-comedy lead whose charms sneak up on you gradually but persistently. Heigl is wonderful here She gives Alison just the right mix of youthful vulnerability and fierce mom-to-be determination. Heigl can pack a world of conflicted feelings into a single brief take At one point we see her exasperation at Bens being an immature jerk segue into a realization that sometimes even an immature jerk can be a lot of fun. Just as Alison nudges Ben toward recognizing that theres more to life than just horsing around with his buddies he frees her from the constraints of being too responsible. Rudd is one of those rare comic actors who can give even abject silliness a surprising amount of gravity. And Mann an underappreciated comic talent (she was marvelous as the ditzy heiress in the otherwise unmemorable ""George of the Jungle"") finally gets the screen time she deserves. Her timing is always crystal-sharp; her motor purrs along on a seemingly endless supply of nervous energy. Even with that tumble of blond curls that translucent skin theres nothing angelic about Mann -- or at least shes an angel with angles. ""Knocked Up"" is the kind of movie that gives even the players in very tiny roles -- like Charlyne Yi as a stoner-slacker girlfriend and the unnervingly brilliant Kristen Wiig of ""Saturday Night Live"" as a passive-aggressive network lackey -- a chance to shine. Theres a generous spirit at work here even amid all these intelligent finely honed jokes. A cranky dictatorial gynecologist turns out to be perfectly decent and kind; a nightclub doorman waxes poetic about the ugly decisions he has to make in order to do his job. There are also many moments of inspired ridiculousness When Alison sees an OB-GYN Debbie has recommended the guy takes a peek between Alisons legs and announces far too cheerily ""Well -- you do look a lot like your sister"" ""Knocked Up"" doesnt trade in easy platitudes about the joys of parenting When Alison and Ben venture out to that first OB-GYN appointment Apatows camera shows us the weirdest-looking babies not the most instantly adorable ones. This is after all a movie about facing your worst fears and recognizing that even when we take a chance on love happiness is never guaranteed. That uncertainty is what links it to the great American romantic comedies Its not as elegant as say ""Holiday"" or ""The Lady Eve"" or ""The Palm Beach Story"" but its wise enough to know that the false promise of happily ever after is more depressing than it is uplifting. Better to acknowledge the bumpiness of the road ahead than to fool yourself into believing you can iron out its kinks. Even so ""Knocked Up"" is shot through with rays of optimism suggesting how we can put our bewilderment and confusion to work and learn how to be better more compassionate grown-ups. The characters in ""Knocked Up"" get a shot at becoming their best selves -- by the seat of their pants but if theres hope for them theres hope for the rest of us too. To err is human to forgive divine. And sometimes the biggest leap begins with a single half-assed baby step. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment.

"Knocked Up This baby delivers | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesKnocked Up This baby deliversLet me fess up to loving Knocked Up - and to admit it does seem strange to give four stars to a movie of crude humour relentless profanity and a hospital scene of seat-squirming intensity.Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen play a pair who find a one-night stand turns into parenthood in Knocked Up.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 1 2007 Starring Seth Rogen Katherine Heigl Paul Rudd Leslie Mann. Written and directed by Judd Apatow. 129 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Let me fess up to loving Knocked Up - and to admit it does seem strange to give four stars to a movie of crude humour relentless profanity and a hospital scene of seat-squirming intensity.Article Continued BelowLet me further report - warn perhaps? - that this is a romantic comedy where the leading man tells the leading lady to ""F--k off"" upon learning that he is the cause of her unplanned pregnancy.Dont turn the page yet. Knocked Up is a different kind of movie a refreshing mix of the whip smart and the heartfelt.When it premiered in March at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin Tex. festival producer Matt Dentler 27 set the tone for what was to come by introducing the film as ""a movie that helps you grow up a little bit.""It does indeed and the life messages come wrapped in those same rude yuks (and yucks) mentioned above.Just as 1983s The Big Chill prompted soul-searching by Baby Boomers about lost idealism so will Knocked Up likely force a reappraisal of values by the commitment-phobic members of the overlapping Generations X and Y of recent vintage. Written and directed by Judd Apatow whose previous movie The 40 Year Old Virgin mined similar comic gold in the perils of immaturity it begins the challenges and the chuckles right at the very beginning conception.An unplanned one the product of a one-night stand between underachiever Ben (Seth Rogen of The 40 Year Old Virgin) and overachiever Alison (Katherine Heigl of TVs Greys Anatomy). Ben is 23 Alison is 24 and they are both required to grow up a lot faster than theyd planned. Ben is an unemployed stoner living off the dwindling cash settlement of a fortuitous accident and lawsuit. He lives with four like minds - played by savage comics Jonah Hill Jason Segal Jay Baruchel and Martin Star- in an L.A. frat house. Bens sole life ambition apart from being perpetually buzzed is to set up a website with his pals to painstakingly list and rate nude scenes in movies. Alison is the fast-rising talent wrangler for a TV entertainment news show who is suddenly promoted to on-air status - probably because shes so good at handling prima donnas (including Ryan Seacrest playing himself in a hilarious cameo).In normal circumstances the paths of Ben and Alison would never cross. But Ben and his mates go drinking at the same bar where Alison and her older sister Debbie (Leslie Mann delightfully daffy) are celebrating Alisons promotion. Uncommon sparks fly and so does the underwear when Ben and Alison take the party home. Followed shortly thereafter by the condom that Ben fails to use - although hes not entirely to blame. Biology ensues.What happens next is something you almost never see in movies like this Ben and Alison act like real people. Confronted with a pregnancy neither of them planned or wanted they dont for the most part engage in the kind of stunts that require suspended disbelief and an ironic soundtrack. They get down to the task of growing up which is never as simple or easy as one hopes - although in this case it is very funny. They are aided and abetted by a strong supporting cast which include the aforementioned slacker pals and sister Debbie plus Debbies husband Pete (the very droll Paul Rudd) who is manfully dealing with his own life problems.For a movie like this to succeed as well as it does you need more than an insightful script and able direction although Apatow provides both. You need a couple that makes you hope theyll be able to work things out even if on the face of things thats the last thing you should be hoping for.That couple is Rogen and Heigl the frazzled faces of fun for summer 2007.

His movies largely feature his friends and family which is usually an invitation to lazy inside-joking. His subjects tend to be none-too-bright slackers and losers which always carries with it the possibility of tiresome indulgence. OK theyre kinda dumb but really isnt there something adorable in their stupidity? The fact is however Apatow represents for the moment at least the best in American movie comedy. The 40 Year-Old Virgin somehow made rather touching and funny sense out of that eponymous condition and its protagonists recovery from it. Now Knocked Up does much the same thing for a much more common situation -- the inconvenient consequences of a one-night stand. Alison (Katherine Heigl) and her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) are out clubbing celebrating the formers promotion from stage manager on one of those Inside Hollywood TV shows to an on-air job. There they meet the overweight unemployed Ben (Seth Rogin). Shes giddy with happiness (and a certain amount of booze) and they retire to her place -- its the guest house at her sisters nice middle-class home -- and have unsafe and unsatisfactory sex. Hes hopeful of a relationship; shes hopeful of never seeing him again. Many distressing pregnancy tests later they both have to come to terms with impending parenthood which of course involves actually getting to know one another. This they awkwardly do. As a movie premise its about as simple as they come. What transforms it into something quite wonderful to see is that Apatow unlike those teams that fashion comedies for the young and retarded is a real writer -- one with something on his mind other than barf jokes and public flatulence (though he includes a few such moments here). He knows how to write funny ""he said she said"" jokes. More important hes a tender observer of ordinary life. Think of him perhaps as a throwback to the kind of screenwriters who created the classic romantic comedies of the 1930s. Which is not to say that his topic is rich ninnies who somehow stumble through confusion to blissful amour. His people are much more ordinary than that. Take Ben for example. He lives in a nest of nerds on the dwindling remains of a long-ago court settlement. They suck on bongs and beer bottles vaguely plan a website that will direct readers to skin scenes in movies -- not knowing of course that its an already overcrowded field -- and dream of dreamgirls they lack the social skills to approach in real life. But if their development is arrested they are not really bad sorts. And thats where Alison comes in. Shes a little bit dim herself and possibly affected by her close proximity to her sisters situation. Debbie is a faithful wife whos reached that awkward age where guys are no longer hitting on her. Worse her husband (Paul Rudd) is withdrawing from her. She thinks hes having an affair but hes not. What hes sneaking out of the house in search of is quiet male bonding -- evenings with the guys that lack the shrillness of his wifes (and kids) restlessness. Another way of saying this is that he films central reversal -- Ben and Alison getting to know and like one another after their first hasty but consequential encounter -- is rendered plausible by Apatows shrewd observations of the people in their lives. Indeed one of the real pleasures of this movie is derived from the fact that Apatow writes his minor characters -- a TV host a wardrobe mistress a slyly envious production executive -- with the same care and wit as he does his major figures. The course of pregnancy runs no smoother than the course of true love and Apatows obstetrical observations -- yes natural childbirth devotees may well call for painkillers when labor becomes more intense than advertised -- are shrewd and edgy. And Alisons hormonally induced moodiness as well as Bens slouching progress toward grown-up status are craftily presented. But for all his hipness and Hollywood hotness Apatow is at heart a square. He clearly believes in marriage family bourgeois dutifulness. Maybe his movie is a little repetitive but thats a negligible price to pay for the careful blending of wildness and good humor that went into its making. Its hard enough to find comedies like this at any time so its a small and welcome miracle to come upon one in the midst of a typical movie summer richer than ever in over-budgeted underwhelming inanities.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Knocked Up"" with Seth Rogen Katherine Heigl Paul Rudd Leslie Mann Jay Baruchel Jonah Hill. Written and directed by Judd Apatow. 129 minutes. Rated R for sexual content drug use and language. Judd Apatow writer/director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and the new ""Knocked Up"" makes very funny movies funnier by far than most comedies coming out of Hollywood. He fills them not with A-list actors coasting on their reputations but fresh new faces and beloved if not tabloid-famous talents. (Consider for example Catherine Keener as the unexpected but perfect choice for the love interest in ""Virgin."") He can do a happy ending thatll send you bouncing out of the theater like the gloriously loopy ""Age of Aquarius"" number in ""Virgin."" And he knows how to create characters that seem genuinely nice so you root for them to live happily ever after. What he doesnt know yet unfortunately is how to pace a movie. So ""Knocked Up"" the story of a not-very-well-acquainted couple who find themselves expecting a baby after a drunken one-night-stand falls short of a triumph. Its a very funny 90-minute movie trapped in a 129-minute movie that has many many dead spots and unfunny patches. By its end in the delivery room (complete with explicit childbirth images that had a preview audience groaning in disgust) the humor has run its course and the movie has worn out its welcome. Too bad because theres plenty to enjoy here. Alison (Katherine Heigl of ""Greys Anatomy"") is an up-and-coming television entertainment reporter ambitious and perky. (Scenes at work with her double-speaking co-workers are among the movies funniest.) At a bar she meets Ben (Seth Rogen) a chunky slacker who lives in frat-boy squalor with four buddies as they attempt to launch fleshofthestars.com a Web site that provides details on famous movie stars nude scenes. (None of them have bothered to find out as it happens that other Web sites pounced on this promising territory long ago.) Fueled by too many drinks Alison and Ben hook up (to the bouncily perfect strains of the B-52s ""Rock Lobster""); the next morning over an awkward breakfast its clear that things wont work out. Two months later along comes a positive pregnancy test and a quickly resolved dilemma Alison and Ben will have the baby and raise it together. And so begins the process of them getting to know each other for real and of Ben learning to leave his bongs behind and grow up. On the sidelines are Alisons skeptical sister Debbie (Leslie Mann Apatows off-screen wife whose zingy line readings turn her character into a sort of screwball shrew) and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) along with Bens flock of interchangeable roommates who are funny in small doses. Heigl and Rogen both have a genuine sweetness and you find yourself hoping against hope that these crazy kids can work it out. But theyre given little to look forward to Debbie and Pete have a fairly nightmarish strained relationship that would turn any watcher against marriage. (Pete at one point describes marriage as ""an unfunny tense version of Everybody Loves Raymond. "") Its odd because Apatows becoming known as a raunchy purveyor of old-fashioned values ""Virgin"" extolled the idea of saving yourself for someone you truly love; ""Knocked Up"" presents a young couple trying to do the right thing by their unexpected baby. However the future he shows them is bleak even when Debbie and Pete mystifyingly seem to work things out by the end. Nonetheless laughs abound in ""Knocked Up"" and audiences starved for comedy should be happy here.

Photo Suzanne Hanover (c) 2007 Universal Studios Photo Suzanne Hanover REVIEW / And youre the father you oaf 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Knocked Up Comedy. Starring Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen. Directed by Judd Apatow. (R. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and to purchase tickets for sele There are lots of good things to say about ""Knocked Up"" the latest from writer-director Judd Apatow but the most essential thing is that its long. It runs 129 minutes which is about a half hour longer than audiences have been conditioned to expect from a romantic comedy. The movies length represents a risk and also some real ambition. Apatow is not trying to do what everybody else does. Like Apatows ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"" is an attempt at a different kind of screen comedy one that can be as absurdist and even more coarse than other comedies and yet doesnt trivialize the characters. Where other filmmakers pull back Apatow delves. Where other filmmakers give you the cliche in place of the emotion the corny shorthand that allows the movie to resolve itself Apatow takes his time and invites the audience to look at his characters as people. Go to ""Knocked Up"" for the laughs. Go for the fun and only later -- if you like -- consider the philosophical proposition behind making a comedy in this way. Apatow like Woody Allen and a handful of others before him is showing how comedy can be at least as valid a means of exploring human emotion as drama. Life is more like comedy than drama anyway -- just look around. So why should comedy be artificial? Apatow shows how a comedy should and can be more like life without sacrificing a laugh. Katherine Heigl plays an E channel talk show host who gets herself pregnant right after her big break. On the fateful night she goes to a nightclub and meets an unprepossessing shlubby sort of guy and for some reason likes him. She finds Ben (Seth Rogen) mildly amusing but hes way out of her league -- younger poorer unemployed badly dressed barely groomed -- and she has no intention of going to bed with him. Then she gets drunk and does anyway. The morning-after scene shows what makes Apatow special. He doesnt go for the usual laughs by having Alison (Heigl) do something extreme (like scream in horror and throw him out) or by having Ben behave with annoying misguided confidence. He finds the humor in the acute discomfort of the situation as it would play in life She is horrified and wants to keep her distance but she is obligated not to be rude. And he likes her and would like to see her again but he can tell that she cant wait to get away. The scene is funny because the situation is awkward and the awkwardness is the product of the characters fullness and awareness. Neither is stupid. They both know exactly whats going on. Once Alison is pregnant the abortion option is handled with perception and economy She has lunch with her know-it-all mother who tells her that she obviously must terminate the pregnancy. Thats it. Shes having a baby. From there ""Knocked Up"" really takes it time tracing the effect of the pregnancy on Alison and Ben together and separately and on their friends and family. Taken one by one the scenes are invariably funny but the overarching ideas of the film are all about growth and human potential. Actually ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" was like that too. Apatow makes good use of the extended running time by looking into the unhappy marriage of Alisons sister (Leslie Mann) and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd). These side characters whod usually be given short shrift as mere comic sounding boards for the protagonists are examined with unexpected fullness and feeling. On the downside some of the humor involving Bens living situation with a bunch of slacker potheads is labored and repetitive. Yet even then Apatows eye for the zany touch never leaves him. He gets a lot of mileage for example out of a bit about a guy losing a bet and not being able to shave. Every time we see him his beard is longer and hes more miserable. Theres a lot more here but its best left to be discovered. ""Knocked Up"" has some rough edges but its a noteworthy film by a significant and blossoming talent. -- Advisory Simulated sex drug use sexual situations harsh language and nudity.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Friday June 1 2007 123 PM ""Knocked Up"" Raunchy romantic comedy about a couple who try to turn a one-night stand into a lifetime commitment. With Seth Rogen Katherine Heigl Paul Rudd. Director Judd Apatow (206). R Language drug use sexuality nudity. At area theaters. ""Knocked Up"" writer-director Judd Apatows hilarious followup to ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is going to make Mr. Skin very rich. Mr. Skins full name is www.mrskin.com. Its a Web site that indexes every female nude scene in movie history. Whether using the Web site as a plot point is an ingenious product placement or just exploitation it makes for some big laughs in a raunchy high-concept comedy about a pothead slacker and would-be Mr. Skin who gets lucky - and reckless - with a TV reporter one night and finds himself staring at fatherhood. What follows is an extreme case of reverse courtship which begins at conception and works backward toward getting to know each other and then moves forward to one of the funniest birthing scenes ever filmed. The willingness of smart super-babe Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl from TVs ""Greys Anatomy"") to start a relationship with slovenly ill-mannered Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is preposterous. But Apatows dialogue is so good the undercurrent of his story so inherently sweet and the performances so engaging that you surrender immediately. Besides Rogen a bellicose comedy actor in the vein of John Belushi and Heigl a star-on-the-cusp the amiable cast includes Leslie Mann as Alisons unhappily married sister and Paul Rudd as her childlike brother-in-law. There are also very funny self-deprecating cameos by Ryan Seacrest Steve Carell and James Franco. Mr. Skin isnt mentioned by name until midway through the movie when Ben and his four scruffy roommates discover the nude scenes theyve spent months indexing for their planned Web site are already online. If Apatow set out to promote Mr. Skin his dazzling star chose not to. Heigl does all her loving in this movie with clothes on. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

A single guy (Seth Rogan) becomes a surprise father in Knocked Up. Photo Universal Pictures Knocked Up 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Boy meets girl. Boy and girl have ill-conceived sex pun definitely intended. Girl gets pregnant. Boy and girl cope. The end. So goes Knocked Up -- two-plus hours of bemused 21st-century riffing on the worlds hoariest story. But its a story with less wailing and gnashing of teeth than the chick-out-of-wedlock plot once demanded (Anna Karenina is so five minutes ago) and it features no fallen-woman moralizing or protracted skid toward suicide. Alison (Katherine Heigl) isnt exactly ostracized when Ben (Seth Rogen) gets her pregnant. Yet the scenario is still plump with cinematic opportunities skewing more toward agile sexual humor than the ancient elemental showdown between society and love. These days in these sorts of movies lovers arent even in love when they resolve to do the nasty; the modern romantic playbook requires them to have sex first then devote the films remaining minutes to sorting out the seriocomic consequences. So the question in Judd Apatows diffident and tender follow-up to The 40-Year-Old Virgin isnt ""Will they do it?"" but Given that they just did it what will they do now?"" The answer Learn breathing techniques. Ben and Alison meet at a club. They get stupid drunk. They quickly progress toward groping sexual commerce during which a condom drops to the floor. After that nature takes its course. Alisons realization about her situation dawns with disbelief and a certain measure of disgust. That guy made her pregnant? The guy (as her sister delicately puts it) ""with the man boobs""? Thats the one. Knocked Up wouldnt work if both halves of the baby-making machinery were equally gorgeous so this is the division of labor Alison is hot Ben is not. His hair is spazzy and his bod is gymless. This aesthetic imbalance might add beauty-and-the-beast tensions to the movie except that Ben isnt a beast. Hes a lazy pothead surrounded by lazy-pothead friends (Jay Baruchel Jonah Hill Jason Segel and Martin Starr playing Jay Jonah Jason and Martin) but he wants desperately to do the right thing. Hes a decent sort. And that goofy grin of his -- its adorable. Knocked Up doesnt pack the madhouse density of belly laughs as 2005s Virgin but it taps into the same prevailing sweetness and improvisational comic licks. Both movies bust hard on doofus men and their delayed maturation and both extol traditional values (marriage and chastity in the first parenthood and responsibility in the second) roughed up with raunch and randy humor. Apatow pushes things along in a straightforward manner navigating Ben and Alison through belated courtship and baby prep with few convoluted detours We have one subplot (littered with cameos) set at E; a second subplot involving Alisons acerbic sister (Leslie Mann Apatows wife) her sisters twitchy husband (uberguy Paul Rudd) and their lovely screaming daughters (little Apatows); and several hilarious scenes featuring knuckleheads with bongs. Otherwise Knocked Up is all about Alisons growing belly and her on/off/whatever affair with Ben. It goes on too long but most pregnancies do. Its lurching and baggy but most relationships are. Its trip to Vegas is a reckless detour but most trips to Vegas -- ah you know. And while Apatows movie isnt perfect its still a fumbling and funny valentine to the shock of pregnancy the reality of love and the chaos of all that comes after. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Banana Republic Extra 50% off sale items + free shipping w/ 50 Sinwood Indoor Electric UV Insect Zapper for 29 + free shipping NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Marc New York Womens Lace Sheath Dress for 26 + 8 samp;h Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

"In Knocked Up family values get a twist - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In Knocked Up family values get a twist By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 1 2007 ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and his new ""Knocked Up"" make writer-director Judd Apatow todays preeminent creator of low-concept sex comedies. The sex is unsafe the drug use is rambunctious and the lewd jokes are delivered with cheer. Yet what happens to his life-size characters could happen to us -- if not perhaps adult virginity then at least holding out for real love. Certain family values remain magically sacrosanct.In ""Knocked Up"" the premise is easily digestible. A budding TV personality becomes pregnant after she beds a doofus and inveterate pothead she meets in a Los Angeles nightclub. Theyre both in their 20s. Shes a beauty named Alison (Katherine Heigl ). Hes a stocky Canadian slob named Ben (Seth Rogen ). Ostensibly all they have in common is horniness.The days before their meeting the meeting itself and the sex happen in a very funny collection of scenes. And quickly we learn that Alisons story will be as well - rounded as Bens. She lives in a cottage behind the rustic suburban house where her older sister (Leslie Mann ) lives with her husband (Paul Rudd ) and their two daughters. Alison has just been promoted to an on-air interviewer position at E and is wary of divulging the news of her pregnancy to her vapid co-workers.The first half-hour sets the bar pretty high. But the rest of ""Knocked Up"" is equally sharp mostly because it turns a convention on its head. Daringly the movie upends the joke of Bens fatherhood by showing him falling in love -- not simply with Alison but with the idea of a family. His wish to be more than some baby-daddy isnt just funny; its tender and quite lovely.Thats not to say that Apatow stints on the laughs. Thanks to Bens grubby coterie of friends outrageousness is built around the movies bracingly wholesome -- OK unfashionably conservative -- center. Ben lives in the San Fernando Valley in a filthy house with roommates -- Jonah Hill  Jay Baruchel  Jason Segel  and Martin Starr -- who are galactic stoners too. The opening sequence gives you the gist They suck on bongs dance by their pool and hit the amusement park all while Ol Dirty Bastards ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"" growls on the soundtrack. Theyre starting a Web business devoted to locating celebrity nude scenes in movies. Basically the sloth is so thick we could choke on it.Ben is obnoxious but in an adolescent way. He doesnt seem like a 23-year-old going on 14. He actually seems 14. Rogen  who had a smaller part as one of Steve Carells buddies in ""Virgin"" is something rare in comedy a guy whose boorishness has charm. The packaging helps. He may talk like a sailor but hes built like the cuddliest of plumbers. He makes it easy to accept that a woman would agree to raise a child with this man even if that woman isnt necessarily you. Still its not entirely clear why Alison proceeds to build a relationship with the jobless moneyless Ben. For one thing she never witnesses the beautiful conversation between Ben and his dad (Harold Ramis ) about paternity. Still the couple looks for a gynecologist together. He agrees to watch ""Breathless "" with her while his buddies play paintball . To help with his ""work"" she willingly warns him that hes about to miss the big make-out scene between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell in ""Wild Things ."" It hardly seems like a fair exchange.Her tolerance is actually astounding. Throughout the film youre waiting for the other shoe to drop and for her to pick it up and throw it at him. Heigl is believable and sympathetic. She plays one of the doctors on ""Greys Anatomy"" and shes at her best here when shes going through Alisons hormonal tantrums and hurt feelings.Alison though has nothing on her sister Debbie. The brittle marriage between Debbie and her husband Pete becomes a possible preview of what she and Ben can anticipate if they make it thinly veiled acrimony. Debbie is the films strangest character. Shes volatile and emasculating (in a moment thats funny for its unrelenting meanness she accuses Pete of not being concerned about the alarming number of pedophiles in their neighborhood) but shes needy and worried about Petes suspicious disappearances.Debbie gets away with being such a cauldron of extremes because the airy-voiced Mann is extremely good at playing them. She happens to be Apatows wife (the kids in the movie are theirs) and with the possible exception of Tea Leoni  its hard to imagine who else could get away with this combination of needling and affection. Rudd is her comedic equal if not her emotional one. Hes been playing variations of the unhappy husband for a while but he finds characteristically silly ways of expressing it Here he deadpans while Mann goes ballistic. Its a strategy thats worked for many a sitcom husband.Apatow has actually spent most of his career in television creating such superior programs as ""Freaks and Geeks "" and ""Undeclared "" two series that wed the raucously antic with great humanity (they were promptly canceled). His sensibility is suited for the small screen. But his comedy philosophy works even better concentrated in a single movie Funny and human neednt be mutually exclusive.In ""Knocked Up"" after Pete and Ben have fights with their women they go to Vegas do some mushrooms trip out at Cirque du Soleil  then still high search their souls back at their hotel room. If Paul Mazursky had ever written a scene for Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble  it would go like this.At some point during this unburdening Pete makes the wounded observation that ""marriage is like Everybody Loves Raymond except that its not funny ."" Apatow invests all his scenes with that kind of piquant feeling. In both of his movies theres a lot of truth in the characters neediness their joy and the struggle to hold onto their standards. Life may be like a sitcom but the comedy generously springs from the situation of being alive.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 13 2011 1201 a.m. ET If this is only a chick flick then call me a chick. Witty raunchy and affecting ""Bridesmaids"" crosses boundaries by blithely ignoring them. At one moment its a broad-gauge farce that examines sex from a womans point of view. (The findings are mixed at best.) At another its a sophisticated comedy of manners and class that pits two bridesmaids against each other for control of the wedding if not the brides destiny. Through it all--the free-form conversations the brilliant set pieces the preposterous gross-outs the flawless performances--Kristen Wiigs forlorn maid of honor Annie seeks her own destiny with a wrenchingly cockeyed passion. A womans point of view is one of the films great distinctions. The screenplay was written by Ms. Wiig and Annie Mumolo--both women are wise in the ways of improv as well as TV--and directed with extraordinary finesse by Paul Feig who created the TV series ""Freaks and Geeks."" As a man though Id say its greatest distinction is its inclusiveness and Im not using that sticky term to be PC. The filmmakers and their producer Judd Apatow see the comedy genre as including all sorts of quirks and qualities that make us human--effusiveness obtuseness tenderness fury delicacy idiocy eloquence. Their characters cannot stop talking. A bad thing? No a great thing because the talk is so smart. Theyve staged the best highway sobriety test since ""The Man With Two Brains"" turned baked goods to the best romantic advantage since ""Waitress."" And the movies Mr. Right couldnt be odder or righter. The bride Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is forlorn in her own way. She knows her impending marriage will distance her from Annie her best friend since childhood. She also knows that her wedding plans are being hijacked by the richest and pushiest of her bridesmaids the ethereally insufferable Helen (a beautifully measured performance by Rose Byrne). The Annie-Helen rivalry fuels much of the plot. It starts slowly and slyly at a celebratory party with rival speeches that keep on going and building and getting funnier. That seems to be the scripts organizing principle--first do this then add that then top it then push it a little higher and keep it going as long as theres something to build on. The result isnt organized all that well--a few scenes misfire and the whole thing goes on a bit too long. (The film might have done with less or with none of Annies grotesque English roommates; theyre built on nothing but arbitrary notions.) That said though the wonder is how often ""Bridesmaids"" reaches the heights and sustains the altitude. ENLARGE Kristen Wiigs Annie has a high old time on a plane in Bridesmaids. Universal Studios A sweetly ridiculous riff with a radar speed gun builds on repetition and expectation--how many cars will it take before...? (I cant resist describing some of this delicious stuff but Im not going to spoil it with details.) A tennis game turns savage. Belching forth from nowhere a gastric event grows too ghastly for words. A gathering of bridesmaids on a flight to Vegas out-airplanes ""Airplane"" as it rises to pure--and I use the word advisedly--pandemonium. Each bridesmaid has her daft appeal though none is as genuinely crazed--or outrageously entertaining--as Melissa McCarthys Megan a creature of formidable girth and unstoppable id. (Annies mother is played by the late Jill Clayburgh an actress and comedienne whose career constituted an anthology of lovely performances.) At the heart of the film is poor desperate Annie who lost the bakery she had opened just as the economy tanked and has yet to find herself as a fully functioning adult. Her car is a wreck though its a Lamborghini compared to her love life which centers on a smarmy Narcissus who treats her like a consumer product thats both disposable and renewable. (Its a tribute to the filmmakers verve that theyve kept the sex scenes funny--extremely funny--since what were seeing is sheer self-abasement.) Ms. Wiigs first starring role on the big screen is a sensation; how could it have taken so long? She is wistful but never tearful in the worst of Annies turmoil intensely likable without trying to be unfailingly interesting and in her big moments--one of which involves a giant cookie--a paragon of antic energy. Then theres the man behind the radar gun a cop named Rhodes whos played to perfection by Chris ODowd. (Its an inspired piece of casting.) ""The cop talks weird"" Annies Porsche-driving lover observes at one point and so he does. He talks with a pleasing accent Mr. ODowd is Irish. He speaks with gentle humor and unforced wisdom whether hes citing Annie for dysfunctional tail lights or confronting her to her confusion and dismay with indisputable evidence of her competence. Rhodes doesnt play a huge role in the proceedings but hes worth citing as evidence of the movies excellence. Heres a man written by women who is both a fantasy figure--this is wedding comedy after all not kitchen realism--and a convincingly endearing original. ""Bridesmaids"" gets at so many things with deceptive ease and startling skill--womens anger the loneliness of the single life the marriage trap the pain of sex along with the joy but also friendship sanity and a vision of love. Watch a clip from ""Hesher"" starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Rainn Wilson and Natalie Portman. Hesher Spencer Sussers debut feature stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a guardian demon who brings life to a bereaved household in what amounts to a long-running home invasion. Mr. Gordon-Levitt is a gifted young actor and a compelling presence in everything he does. In this title role of an outlaw vulgarian and very likely a nut job hes constantly in motion and you cant take your eyes off him. For all of Heshers extravagances though--his foul mouth his wild hair his runaway libido his fondness for heavy metal and his penchant for arson--he isnt particularly interesting not even when hes mentoring T.J. a newly motherless boy played touchingly by Devin Brochu. Thats not the actors fault. The problem lies in the role. Rather than a character rooted in some sort of reality--social satirical psychological take your pick--Hesher is an abstract notion animated by false energy. Almost 80 years ago the peerless French filmmaker Jean Renoir used a similar notion in ""Boudu Saved From Drowning."" (Its readily available on DVD and I wouldnt be surprised if Mr. Susser has seen it.) Michel Simon was the scruffy bum--the protohippie really--who throws himself into the Seine and is saved by a Good Samaritan then turns his rescuers household upside down. But Boudu served Renoir as an instrument of social satire. Hesher serves Mr. Susser who wrote the screenplay with David Michod as not much more than an anxiety-making machine in a movie that otherwise depends on moist cliches (Rainn Wilsons lachrymose widower T.J.s puppy love for Natalie Portmans nebbishy loser) and life-affirming gestures (the movies climax) that feel like borrowings from MTV. The conspicuous exception to these cold calculations is Madeleine the indiscriminately loving grandmother played by my ex-wife Piper Laurie. Madeleine seems to be in the early stages of dementia; at one point she isnt sure if shes sitting in the dark. Everything about this old lady is enchantingly vague--the story she tells about baking a cake with a shortening called Fluffo the basis of her strong bond with Hesher--but nothing needs to be spelled out for Ms. Laurie turns uncertainty into poetry. Her calculation is to toss the calculator. Everything Must Go ENLARGE Will Ferrell as a troubled alcoholic in Everything Must Go based on the Raymond Carver story. Roadside Attractions/Everett Collection According to a screenwriting commonplace--a valid one--big sprawling novels can be rich sources for screenplays (""The Godfather"") while movies adapted from short stories (""The Swimmer"") run the risk of feeling thin. It may seem perverse to mention a film as deservedly obscure as ""The Swimmer"" in the context of Will Ferrells ambitious new vehicle but extreme examples can be illuminating. In that old Burt Lancaster film adapted from a John Cheever story an unhappy suburbanite re-examines his life in the course of swimming home in a succession of neighbors pools. Its nothing but a device and far from a good one. Dan Rush adapted ""Everything Must Go"" from a very short (1600 words) Raymond Carver story about a man sitting on his lawn surrounded by all the things of his life that hes getting rid of in a yard sale. Its a much better movie but still based on a single device and thin and repetitive for the same reason. Watch a clip of Will Ferrells latest movie Everything Must Go. Video courtesy of Roadside Attractions. Indeed its basically a one-man show thats short on conflict. Mr. Ferrells Nick Halsey is an alcoholic who finds himself jobless and then homeless--his wife has shut him out of their suburban house. Contemplating his life as he sits on his lawn in the midst of his worldly goods he has almost no one to talk to but his 12-step sponsor a local cop played by Michael Pena and a neighborhood kid Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace.) Another neighbor played by Rebecca Hall appears only sporadically and to negligible effect. It would be nice to report that Mr. Ferrell overcomes these dramatic obstacles. Hes a serious actor as well as a fine funnyman. (Check out his performance as a charmingly foolish actor in Woody Allens ""Melinda and Melinda."") But Mr. Rushs film functions for the most part in such a narrow emotional range--from sad through mournful to lugubrious with surprisingly few side trips to anger--that you keep rooting for its star to lighten up which he eventually does when its almost too late. From time to time the movie grabs you (though the music keeps repelling you). Taking stock and letting go--of superfluous things of worn-out love--is a strong theme. But the progression of the script is like Nicks self-help program. Were familiar with the steps. DVD FOCUS Knocked Up (2007) Judd Apatow has already had huge success as a writer-director as well as a producer in mating crowd-pleasing raunchiness with a generous spirit and genuine feeling. In this hit comedy the slob hero played by Seth Rogen hooks up at a bar with a gorgeous blonde played by Katherine Heigl. A few weeks after their drunken encounter (which is much more plausible than it sounds) shes pregnant and hes dumbfounded. But the movie which also features Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd is more than a celebration of slobness. Of all things its a paean to family values. Brick (2005) Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Brendan a teenage detective in Rian Johnsons clever parody of film noir thats set in a contemporary California high school. Mr. Johnson has done his homework and he applies the lessons of the film-noir genre with a lively appreciation for atmosphere--Steve Yedlin did the elegant cinematography--and for the pleasures of film-culture clash. (""Bugsy Malone"" meets ""The Big Sleep."") Yet the principle is basically a distancing device--look at us here but imagine us being somewhere else--and the distance grows as the film rolls on. Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) When Will Ferrell plays funny few funnymen are funnier. After a wreck on a Nascar track Mr. Ferrells faux-legendary driver flees his car arms flailing wildly convinced that hes on fire. He isnt but the movie is. This mock-epic send-up of the inspirational sports-movie genre directed by Adam McKay from a script he and Mr. Ferrell wrote burns with a comic intensity that seems too high to be sustainable. Against all odds though the filmmaker and his exuberant cast pull it off right down to a ""Chariots of Fire"" climax. The cast includes Sacha Baron Cohen and John C. Reilly.

Katherine Heigl Leslie Mann and Seth Rogen in Knocked Up My first thought on walking out of Knocked Up (Universal Pictures) was I cant wait to get home and see my baby. Which led to a second thought Good Lord if this raunchy guy-centric summer comedy is also able to inspire pangs of maternal longing its going to do absolutely gonzo box office. Knocked Up is a crossover movie both in gender and in age. You could see it on a first date (though as one of my viewing companions pointed out the dinner conversation after might get a little awkward ""So what if you got me pregnant tonight? Er ... heh."") You could see it with your parents if you dont mind squirming through a few semi-explicit sex scenes. You could even show it to a fairly hip grandmother--mine would have found it hilarious God rest her soul. Its one of those zeitgeist-tapping romantic comedies that feels like a generational marker a Tootsie or The Graduate for the 21st century. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Still there was something about Knocked Up that bugged me--only intermittently during the movie because I was too busy laughing at writer-director Judd Apatows zingy dialogue--but more insistently afterward. I think what it boils down to is this Apatow writes men with far more insight and acuity than he writes women. As a result his portrait of contemporary gender relations is unbalanced Crude and hilarious in Guyville he seizes up when he gets to Ladyland and allows himself to take refuge in comfortable cliches. Its not that Knocked Up is misogynistic--if anything Apatow is uxorious to a fault scrupulously respectful of chicks and the chick stuff they do. He just doesnt seem to get exactly what that stuff is. Advertisement What motivates Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl of Greys Anatomy) a successful self-possessed and officially hot reporter for the E network to have drunken sex with Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) an unemployed schlub who lives in the Valley with four Neanderthal buddies (Martin Starr Jason Segel Jay Baruchel and Jonah Hill)? Dont get me wrong I love funny Jewish guys with curly hair and low self-esteem (hi sweetie) but this is not a sociologically credible hookup. Without knowing a little more about Alisons romantic past or preferences its impossible not to take this mismatch as a sheer plot contrivance a male fantasy a la According to Jim. Its not clear either why Alison--who must be earning a decent salary at E--lives with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and brother-in-law Pete (Paul Rudd). The real answer so the bickering couple can provide a grim counterpoint to Alisons shotgun courtship with Ben while their children (Apatows real-life daughters charmingly unrehearsed) serve as a constant reminder of the new life Alison and Ben have unwittingly set in motion. On their second date Alison tells Ben shes eight weeks pregnant and this being a mainstream movie in which the word abortion literally cannot be uttered--when Bens pal Jonah briefly invokes the procedure he says it ""rhymes with shmashmortion ""--she needs to know whether Bens onboard for the whole fatherhood thing. Allow me to briefly divagate here on the nonexistence of abortion as an option in Knocked Up. This omission smells of the focus group and its a disappointment in a movie that otherwise prides itself on its unsentimental honesty about the realities of unplanned parenthood. Its just not believable that in Alison and Bens upper-middle-class secular L.A. milieu abortion would not be matter-of-factly discussed as a possibility in the case of a pregnancy this accidental. If she doesnt want one great--obviously thered be no movie if she did--but lets hear about why not. Otherwise her character becomes a cipher a foil for Bens epiphanies about growing up without being allowed any epiphanies of her own. The biggest unanswered question about Heigls character is one the movie never tiptoes near--why does she decide to keep the baby? Paradoxically the tenderest most emotionally intimate scenes in Knocked Up arent the romantic ones between Alison and Ben but those involving Ben and his profane posse and his growing relationship with the developmentally stunted Pete. When Pete and Ben do mushrooms together during a just-the-boys getaway in Las Vegas the resulting bull session is as revealing as it is hilarious. Near tears Pete confesses that his wifes desire to be in his company actually frightens him ""I dont think I can accept pure love."" Then he crams his entire fist into his mouth observing ""This tastes like a rainbow"" Later in that same scene Ben pleads with Pete to recognize his wifes stellar qualities Shes gorgeous funny a good mother etc. But Debbie isnt funny at least not intentionally--shes a tense strident harridan a WASP supermom in the mold of Tea Leonis character in Spanglish. Leslie Mann (Apatows real-life wife) is extraordinary in the role wringing laughs from Debbies humorless reactions to Petes incessant jokes. Her character never cracks a joke herself though. No discussion of the representation of women in Knocked Up would be complete without mentioning the very literal presentation of a womans netherparts complete with crowning baby head that appear in the climactic birthing scene. The preview audience I was watching with let out a collective shriek of surprise and lets be honest disgust when that stunt vagina made its appearance not once but three times in a row. The almost clinical frankness of this shot was particularly jolting given the relative modesty of the rest of the film Katherine Heigl has sex with her bra on and we get only a brief (and unflattering) glimpse of Seth Rogens bare butt. The crotch-with-baby-head shots are nowhere near as gross as they could be but they still feel weirdly out of place as if lifted from some Discovery Channel documentary and spliced into the comic mayhem. (They also must have caused some serious debate at MPAA headquarters but the movie nonetheless garnered an R rating.) I can only read this moment as Judd Apatows tribute to the awe of childbirth and the cult of the eternal feminine. Its a lovely impulse but in his next film maybe he could honor women by striving to create female characters with the depth of humor and humanity he gives to men.

The writer/director an oracle of observational humor is drawn to males who arrive very late or very early to the life-cycle party. Witness The 40-Year-Old Virgin and now Knocked Up his ticklish and convulsively funny farce that might be called The 25-Year- Old Father. As you can guess from the title its about a hookup that could potentially upgrade into a high-speed connection. When Ben (Seth Rogen) a scruffy loser without visible means of support picks up Alison (Katherine Heigl) a golden winner riding high on a promotion they fall into bed wake up strangers and share an awkward breakfast. Alison exits so fast she leaves skid marks on the linoleum. On their second ""date"" weeks later she informs him that theyre pregnant. Can a one-night stand lead to hilariously-ever-after? In life not likely. In life its preferable for children to be a product of a committed relationship than vice-versa. Yet improbability is the essence of farce which bypasses brain for funnybone. In other words No fetus no film. This stipulated Apatow doesnt quite connect the emotional dots between Alisons considering an abortion to her decision to keep the baby which unnerved this pro-choicer as the potty-mouthed pothead humor no doubt will unnerve many pro-lifers. Fascinating how laughter dissolves the ideological hard lines. In truth the unplanned pregnancy is a MacGuffin as Alfred Hitchcock tagged the plot device that motivates characters. Look past the jokes about morning sickness and commitment anxiety and what this unpredictable movie is about is forging a relationship. Can Ben and Alison build a bridge between guyville where he crashes with four stoner pals and girlworld where she resides in the tidy guest house of her married sister? Can slacker and workaholic find common ground? Can ordinary Joe find happiness with gorgeous Georgia? Though not the most cinematic of filmmakers Apatow gets the audience into Ben and Alisons heads and hearts merely by showing what the world looks like from their wildly different perspectives. He elicits unexpectedly poignant performances from his leads as well as from Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann (his real-life spouse) as Alisons bickering brother-in-law Pete and sister Debbie. As the pregnant pair try on their relationship they wonder whether all couples are doomed to the too-tight fit of Pete and Debbie. With his apricot curls Seth Rogen resembles an overfed miniature poodle who barks like a Great Dane. The disparity between the lapdog looks and booming voice is madly funny. (I couldnt decide whether it was Rogens delivery that reminded me of Kevin Smith or if it was the films plot similarities to Clerks II. Maybe both.) Heigl a double-dip of praline with caramel is so beautiful that initially you dont notice her comic chops. Note her deadpan when an employer insinuatingly played by Kristen Wiig warns her to watch her weight in language that wont invite a lawsuit ""We want you to be healthy. By eating less."" There are some sidesplitting moments. The sight of Ben too big for the Fisher-Price cottage in the backyard as he plays house with Alisons nieces suggests that hes rehearsing setting up house with Alison. The spectacle of Ben and Pete in Vegas escaping their women only to find amid all the lap-dancer boobage they can talk only of Alison and Debbie. When the girls go clubbing to escape the guys their encounter with the bouncer mines explosive double standards that the movie plays for bitter laughter. For Apatow what alleviates the sourness of gender and spousal wars is the fleeting sweetness of knowing that your partner is there for you no matter what. Apatows marriage of guyville and girlworld is not one made in heaven - hes too pragmatic to observe the rom-com conventions. Whats potent about Knocked Up is its down-to-earthiness.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The searing endearing new comedy ""Knocked Up"" is either the most potty-mouthed chick flick to come along in years or a stag film with a heart of gold. Seldom have such shockingly profane lines been delivered in service of such traditional family values. Writer and director Judd Apatow makes movies that advertise red-hot pepper flakes on the outside and deliver talcum powder. Crass and caustic jokes rub the tongue raw only to be followed by a big drippy orange Creamsicle of self-improvement hope and monogamy. And it all works - hilariously poignantly beautifully - because Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") chooses actors who can pull off his challenging mix of material. In Apatows last major project Steve Carell was less an aging virgin than a timeless romantic. Here Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl arent so much knocked up as knocked about by the withering demands of newfound adulthood. Yes theres some pot in the junk drawer and some porn on the DVD shelf but in the driveway theres a minivan with government-certified child safety restraints. Apatows basic building block is as old as Hollywood the mismatched pair. Rogen is Ben Stone living with an inspiringly unambitious crew of post-college slackers. Their dream is creating a website telling men the exact time in every movie DVD when stars get naked - if only the spilled bong water doesnt blur their meticulous notations. Clubbing one night in a clean T-shirt Ben meets Alison Scott (Heigl) as far out of his league as well - lets just say Yankies payroll/Rockies payroll. Shes a smoking-hot blond with a promising career in television. She lives with her sister (Apatows real-life wife Leslie Mann) and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd) and kids (Apatows real-life kids) in a bickering but basically happy fog of suburbia. Shot senseless by tequila Alison sleeps with Ben. ""Good thing Im drunk"" Ben crows mid-event ""This is lasting forever"" The next morning one look at Bens beached -whale midriff launches a regret in Alisons eyes that stretches back to the dawn of mankind. Of course she gets pregnant - spoiler alert Dont read the title of this movie - but Ben doesnt even have a cellphone to take the fateful call. Alisons nieces have cellphones they can dial from their car seats for crying out loud. Who IS this guy? Bens posse meanwhile puts the venal in juvenile. As he takes her phone call and imagines a second night of bliss their triple-X pantomime would give Adam Sandler pause. Apatow gives just enough background to make these miscreants human as in Ben having lunch with his father (Harold Ramis) ""Im the best thing thats ever happened to you?"" Ben asks his father incredulously. ""I feel sorry for you."" Rogens job is fairly easy as he is a natural slob with generally harmless tendencies. Heigl has the much tougher assignment to play the statuesque blond who can slug it out with the slackers and the pottymouths without turning into a harpie. Shes got comic chops and despite her beauty seems like any other Enraged Girlfriend when she screams at Ben in her car. Apatow helps her out by showing how in Alisons TV world nobody is ever quite perfect enough. She endures humiliating coaching sessions with her smarmy boss (Alan Tudyk) who suggests not that she lose weight since saying so would be illegal but that she work out a little to get maybe ""tighter?"" The story gains parallel strengths with Alisons home life as her sisters marriage groans under the usual weight of family duties. Rudd may want an affair but then again he may just want free time which prompts this pitch-perfect attack from Mann ""You think because you dont yell youre not mean. This is mean."" Earlier Big Sis imparts her wisdom about husbands to Alison ""You criticize them so much they get down on themselves and then theyre forced to change"" Apatow goes on too long more than two hours when the ideal length for comedies is closer to 90 minutes. You could slice three or four scenes from ""Knocked Up"" without missing much including the obligatory guys trip to Vegas though youd miss an interesting discussion on hotel chairs. Apatows main problem is that hes a skilled writer with an ear for human foibles and as his own director hes is reluctant to cut a few good lines in order to make the great lines stand out. Still I doubt youll see a funnier movie this summer than ""Knocked Up."" Apatow has clearly earned the unusual mantle of chief chronicler of modern family life in all its profane glory. His movies are blue no doubt about it. What makes them wonderful is that they are true blue.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 1 2007 Save for later Saved New in theaters Golden Door (R)Director Emanuele Crialese. With Charlotte Gainsbourg Vincenzo Amato Vincent Schiavelli. (120 min.)A Sicilian widower (Vincenzo Amato) brings his mother and two sons to America in this draggy Italian epic thats big on production values but skimpy on inspiration. The protracted journey of the family through the maze of Ellis Island has a documentarylike appeal but too often the scenes are worn down by leaden whimsy. As an Englishwoman seeking entrance to America by banding with the Sicilians Charlotte Gainsbourg is uncommonly touching. Grade C+ Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Knocked Up (R) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Judd Apatow. With Seth Rogen Katherine Heigl. (129 min.)Judd Apatows ""Knocked Up"" is a prime example of what has officially become a genre The hyper-raunchy comedy. Dirty-minded outrageousness works best at least for me when its keyed to characters whose minds I care about. What is ironic about ""Knocked Up"" is that despite its pushing-the-envelope ambitions its essentially a sweet sitcomish story about a schlep Seth Rogens Ben who accidentally impregnates Katherine Heigls beautiful Alison and rises to the occasion by preparing for fatherhood. Rogen is a marvelous comic actor. Heigl is capable of seeming goddessy and klutzy in the same instant. They should be a classic mismatch made in heaven. It doesnt quite click though because Apatow overemphasizes the novelty of pairing an average joe with a hottie. This sort of thing after all has been done before by Woody Allen and Albert Brooks. (Rogen sounds like Brooks and has a similar passive-aggressive force field.) Like those films ""Knocked Up"" is about the union between a self-denigrating yet strong-willed Jewish guy and a WASP princess. In other words Apatow is essentially revising the comedic tropes of an earlier generation and by adding a dosage of sexual frankness accommodating a new audience. Sweep aside the gross-outs and youve got the family values comedy of the year. Grade B+Plagues amp; Pleasures on the Salton Sea (R)Director Chris Metzler and Jeff Springer. With Sonny Bono John Waters Norm Niver Manny Diaz. (73 min.)This one-of-a-kind documentary codirected by Chris Metzler and Jeff Springer and narrated appropriately by John Waters has been playing around the country in theaters and beginning Sept. 1 will appear on the Sundance Channel. Once touted as the ""California Riviera"" the Salton Sea in southern California is now a fetid bog spewing dead fish. And yet a few hardy souls including a nudist and a Hungarian revolutionary who calls himself Hunky Daddy still live there and champion its resurgence. This is a startlingly funny portrait of Gothic Americana. Grade A Next up Culture Cafe Katherine Heigl Is she coming back to TV?

"Knocked Up 3 1/2 stars - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Knocked Up 3 1/2 starsAn unexpected pleasureJune 01 2007|By Michael Phillips Tribune movie reviewMost comic actors are hyper-aware of how their act is playing at any given moment whether in the realm of slob comedy or romantic comedy or in the case of the very funny ""Knocked Up"" a slobmantic hybrid. The better actors nonetheless go about their business and find a way of simply being (or faking a degree of naturalness) letting the chips fall where they may.This is the great virtue of Seth Rogen and of writer-director Judd Apatows accidental-pregnancy fairy tale universal in its premise but very L.A. in its particulars. At its best it has a take-it-or-leave-it laugh-or-dont casualness. Not even an overgenerous 129-minute running time and the late-breaking cliched conflicts of the story line can kill it.Like Apatows 2005 smash ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"" is more verbally adroit than it is visually. But Apatows awfully sharp as a chronicler of contemporary romantic anxieties. Even his gross-out bits and there are many (the standout here is a memorably disgusting running gag relating to pink eye) tend not to announce themselves in the usual ways.Rogen -- key supporting player in ""Virgin"" leading man (or man-boy) in ""Knocked Up"" -- is the ideal Apatow interpreter. On screen the curly-haired wide-eyed actor whose basso marijuano voice belies a jolly satyrs innocence barely seems like hes doing enough. Then after a scene or two you realize hes nailing laugh after laugh like a less manic and tortured John Belushi. ""Virgin"" wouldnt have been the same without him. Rogen and fellow gamer-slacker-stoner Paul Rudd worked up such a remarkable Mutt and Jeff act in scenes that went less than nowhere in terms of the old bugaboo ""moving the story forward"" that they outshone everything else in the movie.In ""Knocked Up"" Rogen and the wily Rudd take their act center stage. Rogen plays a classic L.A. archetype the 30ish cinephile and good-time dude whose career ambitions are vaguely tied to the entertainment industry. (He and his roommates a memorably antisocial crew are working on starting a nude-celebrities Web site unaware of the existence of Mr. Skin.)A one-off with a bright brittle E network functionary played by Katherine Heigl leads to an unexpected bonus and a tense second date that is quite wonderfully written. (If you want a capsule version of it the R-rated international trailer for ""Knocked Up"" is available on YouTube.) To the surprise of their respective support groups both halves of this non-couple commit to becoming a couple lurching forward into a family life.Much of the humor is simple class-conflict material Rogens posse is a bunch of compass-free time-wasters who dazzle each other with riffs on ""Munich"" and references to ""Back to the Future."" Heigls world is corporate and style-conscious with more money spent on shoes. The E staffers sister played by Leslie Mann (Apatows wife) has a nice if routinized upper-middle-class life with her husband played by Rudd (who has a somewhat ridiculous plot-handy secret) and their kids. The sister is quick with advice regarding husband-training ""You criticize them a lot and they get so down on themselves that theyre forced to change.""Theres a distinct sag point in ""Knocked Up."" Apatow engineers artificial reasons for both sisters to break it off with their respective mates which leads to detours such as a ""Swingers""-style trip to Vegas for Rogen and Rudd. Then the story returns to slacker-""Parenthood"" mode. It is this mode I suspect that will ensure a healthy box-office return.Thats the distinctive thing about both ""Knocked Up"" and ""Virgin"" Theyre shotgun marriages of raunch and centrist home-and-hearth values and the marriages stick. Wisely Apatow doesnt throw Rogen out there front and center every minute. Jason Segel plays the most sensitive of Rogens friends and the way he purrs to Heigl that hes off to make a protein shake is a master class in underplaying. Harold Ramis who really does seem to get a kick out of Rogen shares with him a couple of sequences as our heros easygoing father.The real scene-thief though is Kristen Wiig best known as the Target Lady on ""Saturday Night Live."" She plays an assistant to Heigls boss at the E network and the way she mutters her passive-aggressive comments with a nervous smile cloaking a universe of envy with a mere handful of lines she becomes the comic heroine of 2007. You cant help but wonder how ""Knocked Up"" wouldve played with Wiig in the Heigl role. Heigls plenty skillful and her ""Greys Anatomy"" training in tart rejoinders serves her well. But Wiig like Rogen isnt really like anyone else on screen at the moment.Knocked Up  1/2Written and directed by Judd Apatow; photographed by Eric Edwards; edited by Craig Alpert and Brent White; music by Loudon Wainwright III and Joe Henry; production design by Jefferson Sage; produced by Apatow Shauna Robertson and Clayton Townsend.

Its this generations ""When Harry Met Sally"" and its even better than ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" because the freakish situation it uses as a setup is life. It begins with a bang Unemployed pothead Ben (Seth Rogen in a star-making role) has a one-night hookup with uptight but sweet career girl Allison (Katherine Heigl ditto). Oven meet bun. When she finds out shes pregnant she hasnt talked to Ben in two months. She doesnt even have his cell number because he doesnt have one ""payment complications"" he says. ""Im not poor or anything"" he offers ""but I eat a lot of spaghetti."" The entire map of the plot becomes visible. It doesnt matter because each character each scene practically each line is hilarious thanks to writer-director Judd Apatow - the funniest Long Islander since Joey Buttafuoco. Ridiculous comedies can be fine but the ones that matter creep up close to the truth. This one lives in it. Bens stoned roommates - all four of them - drop a hint at what the expecting couple should do It rhymes with ""shmush-shmortion."" But when Allison sees a heartbeat on a monitor the decision is made. This interferes with Bens ""vision"" of what life should be - smoking weed while wearing a gas mask boxing his buddies into a swampy swimming pool - but his father (Harold Ramis) serves him a little McWisdom nugget ""Life doesnt care about your vision. You just gotta roll with it."" Allison lives with her control-freak sister Debbie (Leslie Mann Apatows missus) her brother-in-law Pete (Paul Rudd giving excellent riff on Robert De Niro and even hotel chairs) and their two kids. Pete and Debbies arguments are based not on sitcom-level lazy-hubby gags but real points that can divide smart committed people. Their fights never end because theyre both right She worries about child molesters living nearby and mercury in the kids tuna; he asks ""How much Dateline NBC can you watch?"" One rift - it leaves Debbie telling Pete ""You think because you dont yell youre not mean. This is mean"" - is trivial on the surface but causes Debbie genuinely understandable pain. Its aftershocks reach Allison who sides with her sister and Ben who has bonded with Pete because each has an eye for the little bear traps of existence. ""I wish I liked anything as much as my kids love bubbles"" says Pete who compares life to an unfunny tense version of ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" ""But it doesnt last 22 minutes. It lasts forever."" Rogen a chubbly-wubbly boy-man is a comedy A-Rod He looks funny has a funny voice and writes a lot of his own material - he came up with that ""You know how I know youre gay?"" bit in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" Heigl who appears on the appalling ladysoap ""Greys Anatomy"" has sneakier weapons. She has a gorgeous smile that she mostly keeps under wraps and when shes nervous she has a way of slinging her gaze sideways that can render a guy lost and weightless. Like Meg Ryan at the top of her game she can play annoying while actually being adorable. Every supporting actor gets big laughs. A co-worker of Allisons? He uncorks a killer Jabba the Hutt impression. ""SNL"" s Kristen Wiig checks in to do her lethal mumble. You know youve crossed into comedy Oz if even Ryan Seacrest can be funny. And nothing is more typical of the movies range and soul than a brief bit outside a club in which we flip around to taste the misery of the man who tends the door. Hes allowed to let in 5 percent black people. That means if there are 25 people in the club ""Im supposed to let in one and a quarter black people. I better hope for a black midget."" Raunch is everywhere and will get the biggest laughs an outbreak of pink eye touched off by a round-robin deployment of weaponized flatulence gay jokes and vagina one-liners and a scene about having sex while pregnant in which laughs multiply like a blastocyst. Then there is the crowning shot a crowning shot. No matter how dirty the jokes get though none of them seem in bad taste or at least in no worse taste than reality. Like Rogens character ""Knocked Up"" is a lot more mature than it looks. Its a brilliant comedy disguised as a dumb one. The only puzzling element is the same one that mystified me for six years of ""Sex and the City"" Who are these women who have sex with their bras on? kyle.smithnypost.com KNOCKED UPSwell.Running time 132 minutes. Rated R (sex profanity raunchy humor). At the E-Walk the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay others.

"Knocked Up is funny but its lacking at the core - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Knocked Up is funny but its lacking at the core Unexpectedly expectant Suzanne Hanover / Universal Pictures Katherine Heigl left and Seth Rogen play the unexpectedly expectant parents-to-be in ""Knocked Up."" Katherine Heigl left and Seth Rogen play the unexpectedly expectant parents-to-be in ""Knocked Up."" (Suzanne Hanover / Universal Pictures) Carina ChocanoTimes Staff Writer THE poster for Judd Apatows first feature ""The 40Year-Old Virgin"" gave us Steve Carell gazing beatifically into the middle distance above the encouraging tagline ""Better late than never."" The poster for his second feature ""Knocked Up"" gives us Seth Rogen gazing sheepishly into the camera below the rather more sobering ""What if this guy got you pregnant?"" Rogen arches an eyebrow in a way that suggests he knows you could do better. Hes really sorry. He hopes you can learn to like him.The movie hopes so too so it seriously stacks the deck in his favor. The distinctive element in Apatows comedy has always been his love for what might be called the differently socialized (the term ""loser"" buys in too readily to a system that the writer-director clearly doesnt subscribe to) and ""Knocked Up"" follows happily in that tradition with the opening sequence an exuberant tribute to the dumb life. But if ""Virgin"" mined all that was most pathetic and painful about its heros predicament to create the kind of comedy that made you want to avert your eyes and scream ""Knocked Up"" takes it surprisingly easy on Rogens character Ben even though hes young and beefy and could probably handle the criticism. Ben Stone (Rogen) is an amiable slacker and dedicated stoner whose marshmallow physique underscores his even softer aspirations. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a dewy Valkyrie recently promoted to on-camera talent on the E network. Ben and Alison meet one evening at a nightclub where Alison has gone to celebrate a promotion with her older married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). When Debbie is prematurely called away on a child-related emergency Alison decides to stay behind and keep drinking with Ben and his buddies -- much to their surprise and frankly ours.Is this what its come to for the youth of today? The result of all Facebook and no face-to-face? Because there once was a time long ago when to get these two together youd have had to maroon them on the Blue Lagoon. And yet here an ill-advised one-night stand leads to an unplanned pregnancy an unplanned pregnancy leads to a decision to keep the baby and a decision to keep the baby leads to the young odd couple barely into their 20s deciding to make the best of it and try to make the as-yet-nonexistent relationship work. Its a promising premise and Apatow takes it unexpected directions. But ""Knocked Up"" is so enamored of Ben and his insouciant charm that it fails to wonder what it must feel like for the girl. Its one thing to go with the idea that Ben and Alison dwell in different leagues which after all is the point of the movie. Its another thing altogether for the heroine who in true girl-on-pedestal form is beautiful smart successful nice and pretty much cool with everything never to get even the tiniest chance to wonder if maybe she might have done a little better. Alisons view of her future with Ben fluctuates according to what he does or doesnt do in a given situation or how well or badly her sister and brother-in-law Pete (Paul Rudd) are getting along. But its never measured up to her own hopes or dreams for a relationship. What her type is well never know.It should come as no surprise that a movie like this will be firmly entrenched in the boys-eye-view. But if Alison werent so pregnant youd swear she was stuck in the role of the sacrificial virgin. Ben lives in a post-college frat-house with his buddies Jay (Jay Baruchel) Jason (Jason Segel) Jonah (Jonah Hill) Martin (Martin Starr) and Jodi (Charlyne Yi) where they spend their days combing movies for nude scenes to catalog on their website and thinking up creative ways to smoke pot (fish bowl on the head snorkeling mask etc.).Alison meanwhile dwells in splendor and isolation in Debbie and Petes backyard guesthouse Alison exists on the margins of her big sisters life. Shes never made to suffer the indignity of explaining her situation to her actual friends because she doesnt appear to have any. Until Ben comes along there are no men in her life and her only friends glimpsed for a second appear to be a trio of catty frenemies she hasnt seen in months. Her first visit to a gynecologist comes only after her first missed period and she finds the experience as alien as Ben does.Watching her slowly come around to the idea of mating with this guy for life its hard not to feel kind of sorry for her. Ben may have no job no muscle tone and no clue what hes doing but he may be the best thing that ever happened to Alison by virtue of the fact that hes pretty much the only thing thats ever happened to her outside of work. Thats not to say ""Knocked Up"" isnt funny -- its so consistently well written that it sometimes seems as if every one of Apatows lines has been lovingly hand-crafted by stoned Tyrolean monks. But somehow probably because the central story doesnt quite jell its the loony incidental throwaway moments that really make an impression -- Paul Rudd freaking out over the sheer variety of chair styles in his hotel suite while tripping on mushrooms; Steve Carell as himself backing away from a tense situation on the red carpet; Ryan Seacrests hilarious self-satire as the guy with the most jobs in Hollywood; Leslie Manns unhinged verbal assault on a bouncer for not letting her into a club; the bouncers painfully candid and soul-searching reply; Kristen Wiig as the most terrifyingly passive-aggressive boss ever to schedule a meeting. Perhaps not surprisingly its the subplot involving Debbie and Pete that feels like the emotional core of the movie. Mann who plays Debbie is married to Apatow in real life and her on-screen daughters are also her daughters with Apatow in real life. Still struggling to define themselves within the confines of marriage they are clearly in love yet casually hurt each other without intending to. The complexity of their relationship not to mention the actors superb comic timing and emotional layers make Alison and Bens superficial view of their marriage seem childish and immature. They should be so lucky. carina.chocanolatimes.com""Knocked Up."" MPAA rating R for sexual content drug use and language. Running time 2 hours 9 minutes. In general release.

"First Comes a Baby Carriage washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On First Comes a Baby Carriage Katherine Heigl portrays Alison who gets more than she bargains for from a celebratory outing that culminates in a one-night stand. (Photos By Suzanne Hanover -- Universal) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 1 2007 Following up on his 2005 summer hit ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" writer-director Judd Apatow takes his signature raunchy dumb-but-smart rudeness to the next level in ""Knocked Up"" a coming-of-age comedy in which the adolescent protagonist happens to be in his late 20s. Apatow who created the brilliant television series ""Freaks and Geeks"" has a knack for evoking the joys and terrors of lifes most perilous passages. In ""Knocked Up"" he delivers the same vulgar arent-we-stinkers jokes about men and druggy slack-happy humor that are his stock in trade for his teenage fans. But older viewers will be more tuned in to his lacerating observations about the endless capitulations that define midlife. ""Marriage is like an unfunny tense version of Everybody Loves Raymond "" a character offers at one point. If youve seen the ads youve seen the movie Katherine Heigl (TVs ""Greys Anatomy"") plays Alison an up-and-coming TV executive who celebrating her promotion during a night out with her sister (Apatows real-life wife Leslie Mann) gets drunk and ends up in bed with a dumpy lumpen-dude named Ben played by Seth Rogen. Theres a big misunderstanding about a condom (and the precise meaning of ""Just do it already"") and bingo their one-night stand turns into a nine-month nightmare of facing the music and growing up fast. Rogen a supporting actor known for his work in past Apatow productions is thrust into the lead with uneven results. At times it seems as if he might be his generations answer to Albert Brooks with less neurotic fizz. But his likability never flares into anything more interesting or watchable. (For her part Heigl is ripe and lovely and little else.) Instead the supporting cast continually threatens to walk away with the picture. Paul Rudd takes on the usual Rogen supporting role here as Alisons brother-in-law Pete whose marriage to Debbie (Mann) is sagging under the weight of two kids and a caul of anger and resentment. (Theres a brief stingingly eloquent shot of Debbie sleeping on a trundle bed.) As usual with Apatow hes enlisted a gifted group for the supporting roles including ""Geeks"" alums Jason Segel Martin Starr and James Franco in a cameo. Ryan Seacrest delivers a spot-on jeremiad against the entertainment-industrial complex. In fact the most memorable moments of ""Knocked Up"" dont include Heigl and Rogen. Rather they have to do with Manns hilarious encounter with a club bouncer Rudd breaking into a flawlessly timed version of ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Saturday Night Lives"" Kristen Wiig playing one of Alisons colleagues with the sotto voce bitterness of a highly skilled underminer. ""Knocked Up"" is putatively about Alison and Bens decision to take responsibility for their actions and get together for the sake of the baby. But they are so drastically mismatched that even when they make a go of it -- she relaxes and helps him with his T-and-A Web site he finally gets a job and stops smoking weed -- their romance feels forced and wrong. You get the sense that what Apatow really wants to talk about is whats going on in the background where Pete and Debbie engage in the psychosexual gamesmanship that is modern marriage. (Apatow demands some suspension of disbelief when they decide to go through with the pregnancy Are we to believe that someone as together as Alison doesnt have a regular OB-GYN? That she would take a guy she barely knows into the examining room with her?) The only person who suggests that Alison get an abortion is her mother who makes callous mention of a relative who after she got hers went on to have a ""real baby."" The political implications of ""Knocked Up"" aside its biggest problem lies at its very narrative core which is that its nearly impossible to root for two people contorting themselves so painfully to pretend that they love each other. When ""Knocked Up"" finally arrives at its predictably happy ending Heigl and Rogen havent generated any chemistry and nothing about them or their characters suggests that theyre meant to be together. But thats almost beside the point for a comedy that believes so winningly in getting credit for trying letting go of your illusions and learning to be happy. As much as ""Knocked Up"" aspires to end with a hug it winds up in more of a shrug. Leave it to Apatow to make a deceptively sophisticated meditation on the ambiguities of personal morality -- with pot jokes. Knocked Up (125 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexual content drug use and profanity.

"Expecting belly laughs -- but settling for trite tone-deaf - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Bong Expecting belly laughs -- but settling for trite tone-deafmovies`Knocked Up might be a hit but its no `40-Year-Old VirginJune 1 2007|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticWhats wrong with this picture?Aside from the fact that there isnt enough alcohol in Anaheim to get Katherine Heigl drunk enough to have sex with Seth Rogen I mean.And that running time. Two hours and nine minutes? Even a good romantic comedy outstays its welcome after 100 minutes.Knocked Up positions itself as this summers 40-Year-Old Virgin. But its actually this summers Jersey Girl a tone-deaf skip down parenthood lane for a generation that grew up on bong hits blogging and supposedly safe sex.It may touch a nerve among the uncensored the uncommitted and the irresponsible. It may even be a smash hit. The bong hits have a way of adding up . . . and subtracting.Rogen plays Ben a charm-impaired perpetually stoned Net-nerd living with his post-grad pals waiting to launch their novel idea of a Web site dedicated to documenting movie nudity -- fleshof thestars.com. One of the movies best jokes is that anybody drawn to the film will know theres already a site like that -- mrskin.com.Heigl of TVs Greys Anatomy plays Alison an up-and-coming TV floor-director for E television who has just been promoted to on-camera. Provided she loses weight. Not that her boss can come out and say that.""We just want you to be healthy. By eating less.""The Web site loser and ambitious TV beauty hook up after drinks. And weeks later Alison gets the bad news. Shes ""with child"" or as crude devoid-of-social-skills Ben puts it ""knocked up.""Since its hard to make comedy out of abortion and that would make a movie considerably shorter than this ones two-plus hours she decides -- for no moral or intellectual reason we can discern -- to bring this fat hairy loser-strangers seed to term.Ben tries to bond with Alisons family (Paul Rudd less funny than usual is Alisons brother-in-law Leslie Mann is her funny-shrewish sister).Alison and Ben audition OB-GYNs try to make a relationship out of an accident (they have nothing in common) and Ben comments in the most tactlessly vulgar terms possible about their/his predicament. Not that he isnt clinging like grim death to the hottest woman ever to glance his way.The 40-Year-Old Virgins director Judd Apatow becomes the latest filmmaker to discover the wonders of pregnancy as if hes the first father-to-be to ever experience it. His new wrinkle is in how he goes for the gross and the graphic (childbirth in all its glory) as he tells us this tale of a one-night-stand that could never be and an aftermath scripted straight out of anti-abortion pamphlets you sometimes find stuck under your windshield wiper.Apatow manages these amazing scenes -- a doorman emotionally unburdens himself to a beautiful but over-30 woman he has denied admission to the hot club; a heartfelt telephone cursing jag at an absent OB-GYN and a pleading confrontation with that doctors ill-tempered no-nonsense replacement. Bit players (one roommates stoned girlfriend) land the big laughs. And celebrities score points by ""being themselves"" in the E scenes. Ryan Seacrest has never been funnier.Then Apatow slouches back to another moment with Bens friends. The movie settles into marijuana mode. The guys banter and take bong hits in the sincere hope that youre as stoned as they are and will laugh at whatever they say.The bigger message that the men folk arent adult enough to deal with condoms and safe sex much less pregnancy is trite but time-tested. No its not new but it still can be funny.But the stars have so little chemistry that Knocked Up can seem nine months long and not just two-hours plus.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The small miracle of Judd Apatows The 40-Year-Old Virgin is that it played by the rules of a frathouse sex comedy--the inexperienced nerd hero the cadre of guys pushing him into action ample Tamp;A and raunchiness--but it tweaked them with knowing humor and underlying sweetness. With several of his gifted troupe of actors returning from Virgin (and a few more from his beloved TV shows Freaks And Geeks and Undeclared) Apatow pulls off the same feat in Knocked Up an uproariously frank treatment of pregnancy and impending adulthood. Movies about family chaos are generally the province of PG-rated Steve Martin comedies which makes the raw candor of Apatows film not only refreshing (and infinitely funnier) but more honest in its sentiment. After all whats a more common experience chasing after a dozen obnoxious kids or the core anxieties of bringing that first baby to term? A loveable fixture in Apatow projects since Freaks And Geeks Seth Rogen is a revelation as a stoned slacker who lucks into a one-night stand but struggles to deal with the complications that follow. Perpetually between jobs Rogen and his housemates (Jay Baruchel Jonah Hill Martin Starr and Jason Segel--all brilliant Apatow discoveries) are trying to launch a celebrity skin website called fleshofthestars.com but they smoke weed and clown around most of the day. With a little charm and a lot of alcohol that great equalizer Rogen manages to seduce Katherine Heigl a gorgeous career-minded woman whos well out of his league. When Heigl discovers that shes pregnant she gets back in touch with Rogen and they have to figure out how to make their relationship--as mother and father and possibly as boyfriend and girlfriend--work. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann lend invaluable support as Heigls brother-in-law and sister who know a lot about the stress of child-rearing and long-term partnerships. Knocked Up goes through every step of the pregnancy--without skimping on the gynecological details--and watches as the baby develops along with Rogen and Heigls relationship. Naturally theres some confusion between the two Just because they want to do the responsible thing as parents does that make this odd couple right for each other? Apatow and company take these matters seriously yet most of the scenes are played for laughs too and they mine a wealth of great material. No one writes for ensembles better than Apatow (who could probably spin whole movies out of the misadventures of Rogens buddies or Rudd and Manns contentious marriage) and his players are all skilled at giving his work a loose improvisational feel. That looseness again results in a comedy that stretches well past the two-hour mark but thats part of the Apatow touch He makes viewers want to hang out with his characters indefinitely.

A prolific producer of knockabout comedies pillorying the lunacies of the sports (Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby) and entertainment industries (Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy The TV Set) Apatow turned writer-director and shifted his loopy gaze to material thats as familiar as an old boot -- coming of age work love and marriage -- giving it a personal stamp thats filthy-minded sweet-tempered and fresh as a daisy. Sexual terror was his subject in The 40-Year-Old Virgin; his new movie Knocked Up is about the fear of growing up. Both draw their vitality from being set among the freaks and geeks who have shaped Apatows life and become his bread and butter. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Lord knows the world doesnt lack for slacker movies but Apatows singular achievement has been to drag an increasingly worn-out indie subgenre into the mainstream without sacrificing its R-rated edge. Hes also a cockeyed foulmouthed romantic who brings together unlikely partners and makes them stick against formidable odds. In The 40-Year-Old Virgin worldly Catherine Keener saved fastidious Steve Carell from his obsessive loneliness and the less-than-subtle efforts of the single guys he works with to part him from his cherry. In Knocked Up opposites of a different stripe attract and its harder to decide who is saving whom.Breakfasting awkwardly together after a boozy one-night stand Alison (Greys Anatomy star Katherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen) come face to face with how little they have in common other than the fact that theyre perfect strangers. Shes an ambitious reporter for a leading entertainment-news television network. Hes a shambling chronically underemployed Jewish Build-a-Bear with a painfully acute understanding of just how far out of his league hes strayed with this lithe blond shiksa. So when Alison calls Ben several weeks later hes thrilled at least until she drops the bombshell that shes pregnant. ""Oh fuck off"" he blurts out which is less a rejection than an Apatow slackers preferred way of registering shock. On one level Knocked Up is a nerds wet dream Against her better judgment Alison grows fond of her accidental beau though its hard to imagine anyone less qualified to do the right thing in such a predicament than Ben whos so strapped for cash and romantic imagination that he proposes by bringing her an empty engagement-ring box. Still he squares his chubby shoulders and does his best to shape up. When Ben and Alison have to step into each others world their troubles really begin.Like most of the other comedians Apatow has worked with -- Ben Stiller Will Ferrell Adam Sandler Carell -- Rogen a Canadian standup comic who all but stole the show as the potty-mouthed floor salesman in The 40-Year-Old Virgin combines hapless sweetness with a stubborn sense of adolescent self that refuses to cave to the demands of adulthood. Egged on by the four like-minded bozos with whom he lives in a disheveled state of arrested development getting high playing stupid games and pretending to set up a celebrity-sex Web site Ben shuttles between his growing love for Alison and his terror of getting sucked into the grown-up world.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Line for line Knocked Up isnt quite as funny as The 40-Year-Old Virgin which got most of its laughs from the friction between prissy Carell and his sex-crazed stoner co-workers. But it is equally good as a nutty anthropology of marginal living and as an illustration of how much energy it takes to do nothing in a work-obsessed society. Perhaps the movies best joke is that Alisons milieu which is dominated by her ball-buster of a sister (played to the WASPish hilt by Apatows wife Leslie Mann whose hostile exchange with a black nightclub doorkeeper alone violates enough Hollywood no-nos about age and race to have earned the movie its R rating) and her cowed record-producer brother-in-law (Paul Rudd) makes an exhilaratingly poor case for maturity.A self-confessed former dweeb and now a happily married family man Apatow effortlessly lampoons both worlds without dumping on either. He isnt defensive enough to be a rebel and hes too far along with his life to be a Young Turk. At once too broad and too tender for satire his comedy is realism plus exaggeration plus dirty talk plus an unexpectedly sweet moral core that tells us lifes a mess in which the best we can do is grope and muddle our way to a kind of decency. In less outre hands the baby pictures that frame the closing credits would make me gag. In Knocked Up they feel earned.KNOCKED UP | Written and directed by JUDD APATOW | Produced by APATOW SHAUNA ROBERTSON and CLAYTON TOWNSEND | Released by Universal Pictures | CitywideKnocked Up Trailer Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Sex happens. Slacker shlub and drunken beauty experience misunderstanding about the use of condoms. Conception happens. Beauty no longer drunk chooses to go through with pregnancy and raise child even if dad is a baggy man-boy who lives with stoned roommates. Shlub announces ""Im on board."" Ben doesnt exactly choose to grow up -- he remains partial to rumpled T-shirts bearing slogans and convinced of his status as ""the guy girls f-- over."" But by the time writer-director-producer Judd Apatows extremely rude extremely funny irresistible fairy tale about contemporary American frogs princesses childbirth classes and bongs comes to its sunny satisfying conclusion the shlub has become a mensch. Knocked Up is comic chicken soup for the Colbert Nation soul. How the auteur who previously crafted the timeless American romantic-comedy classic The 40 Year-Old Virgin does this so successfully -- mixes the raunchy with the sweet the boob obsession with the sight of a babys head crowning in childbirth the gross laughs with the ungooey heart -- can I think be credited to four strengths and lets start with the shlubbiest Seth Rogen as leading man. Was a guy who got lucky on a hook-up ever so believably a mix of decent Joe and hapless meatball? Rogens delivery of even the most provocative opinions (""Steely Dan gargles my balls"" is one I savor) is always tinged with distracted good spirits and self-deprecation. And his daft lightly Jewish-identified sponginess sets off Heigls own achievement in playing a sharply sensible shiksa to great advantage. Second in contrast to the terrors (and lest we forget hilarities) of unplanned out-of-wedlock parenthood Knocked Up spends quality time with Alisons married sister Debbie (embodied with showstopping authority and killer comic timing by Leslie Mann whose credits include Big Daddy and marriage to Apatow) her vaguely restless husband Pete (handsome MVP of thinking-mans comedies Paul Rudd) and their two young daughters (played with fizz by the Apatows own spirited girls Maude and Iris). Debbie and Pete arent exactly the After to Alison and Bens Before -- theyre more like experienced upperclassmen to freshman puppies overwhelmed with just getting to know one another clothed. In his depiction of imperfect trial-and-error family life -- funnier than Bergmans Scenes From a Marriage but just as keenly observed -- Apatow honors everything he holds serious without losing a single ticket buyer out for a yuk-a-minute good time. Third even more than in The 40 Year-Old Virgin the movie has an uncanny empathy not just for dorks who like pictures of naked boobs but for the gender that comes equipped with those boobs too. Bens got mouth-breathing housemates with a dumb penchant for horseplay and a dumber sense of hygiene and nutrition and Apatows knack for keeping faith with their retarded social development is admirable. But then as Elaine on Seinfeld might have put it the filmmakers got access to uh the equipment 24 hours a day. That he is able to nestle himself so comfortably in uh chick skin is the revelation of this guys night/girls night/date night/get-a-babysitter night treat. And for that the Academy would like to thank Ms. Mann and the little Misses Maude and Iris Apatow for what are surely their contributions to their hubby and daddys exquisitely raised feminist consciousness when it comes to issues like pregnancy testing body image togetherness time dining with another couple at a nice restaurant and the whole Mars-versus-Venus thing. Finally Knocked Up may be the sharpest most up-to-date commentary on current pop culture not involving Jon Stewart or Comedy Central. The riffs tumble free and loose (""Matthew Fox -- you know whats interesting about him? Absolutely nothing"") and the references are elegantly tossed off even in the presence of a gynecologist pointing out fetal features on a sonogram. (Says a queasy Ben ""Im breathing like James Gandolfini here"") Im breathing hard too because this comedy is such a blast of fresh air.

By Anthony Lane Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl in the new movie from Judd Apatow the director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin.""   Credit ROBERT RISKO What relation does Judd Apatows ""Knocked Up"" bear to his previous movie ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""? It is not a sequel though some of the same actors return for second helpings. Nor is it a companion piece since its research topic has switched from a guy who hasnt had sex but wants it to a guy who has had sex but wishes he hadnt. Indeed since the new film is about the comic if hardly unprecedented results of having unprotected sex let us agree to call it an offshoot. My suspicion is that Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) changed his name having started life as Benjamin Flintstone. All the Freddishness is there the near-maniacal fun-seeking the bearish bulk that will one day (all too soon) congeal into fat and the belief that responsibility is a fine and terrible thing. Ben is a La-Z-Boy in human form who lives with four emotionally stunted losers better known as friends Jonah (Jonah Hill) Jason (Jason Segel) Jay (Jay Baruchel) and Martin (Martin Starr). Note the first names the point being not just that inventing new ones would have been you know a total drag but that it presumably allowed Apatow who wrote as well as directed the film to let the backchat flow on and off the set like a two-way current. Even if the onscreen range of conversation is confined to the use and abuse of the body and even though you may recoil at the outcome Apatow is unquestionably expert at defining people by the particular voltage of their talk as shown by this quintet of slackers. Having dared Martin not to cut his facial hair for example they then spend the rest of the film competing to pinpoint whom he most resembles. ""Scorsese on coke"" makes way for the climactic ""late John Lennon"" although the winner has to be ""You look like Robin Williamss knuckles."" One night Ben goes to a bar picks up a girl and goes to bed with her. Both are drunk at the time and both in consequence throw up Ben the next morning (""I just yakked"" he says winningly over breakfast) and the girl--who is no girl but a young woman named Alison (Katherine Heigl) with a growing career on television--some weeks later into a trash can at work. Here comes the bit that will divide Apatows audience and (he hopes) get them arguing over the movie Alison decides to inform the father and little by little to enfold him and his oafish froggy grin in the gentle business of parenting. Call it the taming of the Shrek. Most women I imagine will scoff with incredulity this is neither a last hurrah (Alison is still in her twenties) nor the ideal time (she has a good job) and Ben is the last slob on earth she would have chosen. Most men meanwhile will be too busy watching through their fingers. To them this is ""The Omen."" Apatow unlike his hero is nothing if not careful born in Syosset New York now living in the Los Angeles area he clearly wants his movies to shock but not to repel a conservative audience and thus the idea of his heroines aborting the child is no sooner floated than dispelled. Indeed as with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" what follows is a morality play dressed up as a filthy piece of mummery. When Ben takes Alison to meet his pals who are hard at work designing a nudity-in-cinema Web site Jason welcomes her or at least her breasts with the words ""Your bodys reacting really well to the pregnancy; amazing how quickly the milk arrives."" Yet Ben himself is won over and as labor begins it is he primed with natal information who asks her ""Have you had your bloody show?"" To Jason that would be just another Web site. On the surface Apatows films are about sex--obsessively exclusively and exhaustively. (This one lasts more than two hours.) But that is a clever feint for their true subject is age. The title of the last film was a giveaway the dilemma of the Steve Carell character being not that he was a pure maiden but that he remained in effect a lonely child. The problem ramifies and grows unexpectedly touching in ""Knocked Up"" which sports a laid-back honest scene between Ben and his father (Harold Ramis) and any number of acrid exchanges between Alisons older sister Debbie (played by Leslie Mann the directors wife) and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) as they rip themselves apart over their loss of youth. ""My life is an unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond "" Pete confides. He sneaks off to play fantasy baseball as if for a lovers tryst while Debbie and Alison try in vain to get into a night club provoking out of nowhere a devastating speech from the doorman who points out that one of them is pregnant and the other too old. For the record he also informs them that he a black man is forbidden to let the ratio of black customers rise above five per cent. At times like that Apatow is within reach of real bitterness and he may yet make films that kick at the fences erected by society. For the moment however he is too easily tempted by erections of other kinds and to be fair one would hardly wish him to spoil the fondness with which he views his characters. Rather than spiting them he gets other people to laugh at them--hence the dangerous ease with which those in minor roles come to colonize his movies often bearing a quiver of one-liners to which the hero and heroine have no response. Seth Rogen is unceasingly likable as Ben and the puerility of the tale which would otherwise pall for anyone over the mental age of fifteen is somehow redeemed by his tolerant sweetness yet I prefer his supporting turn in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" where he fired barbs from the fringes of the action to his prominence here. Thank goodness that the sublime narrowness of his cultural references holds firm ""If any of us get laid tonight its because of Eric Bana in Munich "" he tells his drinking buddies which is almost as stirring as his Olivier-like exhortation to Steve Carell on the brink of a pickup--""Be David Caruso in Jade. "" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" closed with a deflowering as expected but also with a kitsch rendition of ""Aquarius"" by the assembled cast half-mocking its heros newfound ethereal contentment. ""Knocked Up"" is more pleased with itself and I suppose that with a baby due there is no way it was ever going to avoid a sentimental splurge familiar from other birthing films like ""Nine Months"" and ""Parenthood."" The likelihood of Apatows turning into Chris Columbus or Ron Howard however seems refreshingly slight. Besides he has a job to do there are women out there who badly need men to grow up and the men really dont want to so who will referee? The best performance in ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" comes from a monkey. He belongs to the jaunty Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and given that in the course of the film he is required to ignite a rocket freeze his fur off dangle from a parachute and most ignominiously take the place of a cannonball he--or his agent--may well have requested that half his scenes be played by a stunt monkey or at least a monkey double. On the night I saw the film he also earned the most laughs putting more experienced actors to shame. In short the only person who could derive lasting satisfaction from this movie is Charles Darwin. It is the third in the series the first and most engaging film having been spun off from a theme ride at Disneyland. The second though blessed with pleasing inventions was a more ponderous affair but the memory of it is like rarest gossamer compared with the third which takes a hundred and sixty-seven minutes to pummel us into submission. Advice to Johnny Depp fans enjoy a seafood dinner skip the beginning and roll up after half an hour. You wont have missed a thing. It takes that long for his character Captain Jack Sparrow to flounce into view. Jack is marooned in Davy Joness locker--or as we like to say in the overworld ""dead""--and it falls to Barbossa aided by Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to fetch him back. This means sailing through polar ice floes plunging over a waterfall and winding up on a barren strand; or if you are the director Gore Verbinski it means putting your blockbustering on hold while you try your hand at an art movie. Not a good idea. Thus we get Jacks vessel stuck in a blinding salt desert with stones that turn into crabs and not one Johnny Depp but a whole shipful of them who swarm around like the Oompa-Loompas in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" Whether Jack is hallucinating or splitting his personality (neither of which one normally associates with the afterlife) I cannot say but the result is a multimillion-dollar retread of Bunuels ""Simon of the Desert"" without a scrap of Bunuels coruscation. There is no denying the ability of Verbinskis production designers to conjure credible textures--slime steam and desiccation play their part with a group of characters emerging from dark unctuous waters like Martin Sheen in ""Apocalypse Now""--but when the beat of the story varies so wildly those finely worked surfaces lose all power of suggestion and the film descends into an indiscriminate soup. Apart from a Singapore-based pirate named Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) most of the figures here will be familiar Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy) the starchy Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Wills late father Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) who more than ever strikes me as half man half bouillabaisse. A subplot requires Will to save Bill by getting hold of the Black Pearl but for the life of me I couldnt remember whether the Pearl was a man-of-war a precious stone or a sex toy--or for that matter whose heart was in the treasure chest and which sailor at any given moment was on board which damn ship. At the climax two vessels get their rigging entwined on the rim of a whirlpool which sounds impressive but give me a hot bath an open plughole and a pair of rubber ducks and I could have laid out the situation more efficiently. As ""Spider-Man 3"" has proved rumpus minus cohesion equals mess. The people making these sequels are so drenched in the saga that they commit the fatal error of presuming that we are in the same boat--that we have spotless recall of every twist in the earlier films and can barely breathe because of our desperation for more. What they fail to realize is that big summer movies even the successful ones are designed to be forgettable passing through our system at precisely the same rate as a pint of Pepsi. Nothing is left but fizzing nerve ends and a sugary soupcon of rot. At one point in ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Wits End"" as it must surely come to be known a sailor asks of Jack ""Do you think he plans it out or just makes it all up as he goes along?"" This is a false distinction. Even Depps ad-libs now have a prepackaged air and whatever the reserves of ingenuity and cash that were poured into the movie it tends to founder when decisiveness is called for--not unlike Lord Beckett struck dumb as his ship is torn by cannon fire from both sides. The sight of him stepping down off the poop deck with the world blowing to splinters around him is beautifully done and his lordship like many of those present looks content to be rid of the absurdities that have reduced the ""Pirates"" franchise from jollity to wreck. The theme ride is now a ride without a theme. ""Gentlemen I wash my hands of this weirdness"" Captain Jack says. Sir you speak for us all.

Judd Apatow is making the freshest most honest mainstream comedies in Hollywood. The writer-director has managed to synthesize the neurotic outsider comedy of Woody Allen the benign satire of Paul Mazursky and the gross-out combustibility of the Farrelly Brothers into a sweet raunchy and loose style all his own.Apatows favorite subject is the eternally adolescent male in this case the reefer-smoking videogame-playing slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) whose inclination is to remain forever in the romper room of overgrown childhood. Reality bites in the form of Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) an out-of-his-league beauty who takes the frazzled grateful Ben to bed after too many drinks. The movies title telegraphs the outcome. Alison wants the baby and she wants to get to know the father and thus ""Knocked Up"" weaves its very contemporary variation on a romantic comedy in which Ben must face the horror of ... growing up.The delight of ""Knocked Up"" is not the standard-issue premise. Its in the details and tone in Apatows avoidance of sitcom shtik. And in the anomaly of a romantic leading man as unprepossessing as the scruffy Rogen (casting as against the grain as Dustin Hoffman seemed back in the day of ""The Graduate""). Apatow takes a boy-centric genre the big-studio coming-of-age comedy and writes equally strong parts for the women. Running parallel to the Ben-Alison romantic comedy is the portrait of the prickly marriage between Alisons older tightly wound sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her skittish husband Pete (Paul Rudd) that demonstrates Apatows uncanny understanding of the male-female divide. These two have a fight set off by his fantasy-baseball obsession that cuts so close to the bone you can feel the audience flinch--and take sides along gender lines. ""Knocked Up"" can be uproariously funny on subjects other directors havent touched the scene that reveals Bens fears about having sex with a pregnant woman could become a classic and Debbies rant against a bouncer who says shes too old for entrance into a trendy club is a bravura screed. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The components of ""Knocked Up"" may seem familiar but they come together in ways that keep surprising you. You have to take certain big plot points on faith Alisons decision to have her child and her decision to include Ben in her pregnancy are tossed off casually and not altogether convincingly. Yet scene by scene the comedy is wonderfully alive--watch for Ryan Seacrests witty self-immolation. ""Knocked Up"" runs two hours plus--unusually long for a comedy--yet it never feels overextended.

"Knocked Up | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; knocked-up ) Knocked Up (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli For Knocked Up writer/director Judd Apatows sophomore feature the filmmaker has elected to follow pretty much the same formula that made his debut The 40 Year Old Virgin such a success. Considering how winning the formula is its a safe approach. The often ribald humor is genuinely funny. The characters are endearing. And theres something warm and sweet about the underlying storyline. Apatow is clearly a romantic even if theres a profane edge to his ""love conquers all"" worldview. Other filmmakers embarking into the comedy minefield could learn a thing or two from him. Hes two for two. Knocked Up opens by introducing us to the oil-and-water protagonists. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is an up-and-coming twentysomething whose professionalism and sunny personality have earned her a promotion at the E Entertainment network to an on-camera interviewer. The appropriately named Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a laid-back slacker whose definition of ""work"" is watching movies for nude scenes by celebrities that will be used in a database for a Mr. Skin-type website. When hes not doing that hes either smoking pot or hanging out. On the night of Alisons promotion she goes out to a club where she runs into Ben. A number of drinks later the two are rolling around on her bed and thats where theres a misunderstanding about whether he should wear a condom. Two months later it becomes clear that there will be more to the Alison and Ben story than a one-night stand. Morning sickness leads to a positive pregnancy test and Alison contacts Ben to give him the news. She decides to keep the baby despite advice to the contrary from her mother and he agrees to support her. They decide that it might be a good idea to get to know one another better since one way or another their lives will be entwined. In casting Alison Apatow initially went with Anne Hathaway. When she left the production for ""creative differences"" he chose one of the hottest young TV stars Katherine Heigl (who I still remember as the 14-year old from the Gerard Depardieu horror My Father the Hero). Heigl is perfect for the role fetching likeable and energetic. For Ben Apatow pulled an actor out of his usual pool - Seth Rogen who was a sidekick in The 40 Year Old Virgin and also appeared in the TV series Freaks and Geeks for which Apatow was both a writer and director. Rogen does a solid job presenting Bens character arc from charismatic irresponsible loser to assertive responsible father-to-be. The supporting cast includes Leslie Mann as Alisons older sister Debbie. Mann actually has some of the films most memorable moments including a profane tirade at a club doorman who wont let her in because shes too old. Mann shows more presence in Knocked Up than in any of her previous films. The always reliable Paul Rudd is Debbies husband Pete whos the perfect picture of a guy whose stressful life has gotten the better of him. At its heart Knocked Up is as much a romance as it is a comedy. The film is surprisingly touching especially as it chronicles the attempts of Alison and Ben to find common ground. These are two people who could fall in love - who want to fall in love - if circumstances will give them the opportunity. The secondary story which contrasts Debbie and Petes relationship with that of Alison and Ben is well handled and doesnt feel like something that was shoehorned in at the last minute to beef up the running time (which is a little long at 128 minutes). Knocked Up includes plenty of laugh-aloud moments and many more that generate subdued chuckles. Apatow understands what audiences find funny and more importantly knows the criticality of comic timing (something increasingly rare in Hollywood). A lot of his jokes work because they are delivered perfectly. The dialogue is sharp the characters are developed as more than props for gags and pratfalls and theres a respect for the audiences intelligence that is often not evident in summer movies. Memorable moments include Ryan Seacrest doing a self-parody that William Shatner would love a few truths about pink-eye and a delivery room sequence that goes further than I can recall seeing in any other mainstream feature. Its hard to say whether Apatow has grown with Knocked Up but he hasnt regressed. The humor is just as edgy and R-rated as it was in The 40 Year Old Virgin and its likely that those who enjoyed the previous movie will be as entertained by this one. If more movies were like this going to see the majority of Hollywoods so-called ""comedies"" wouldnt be such a dull and joyless experience. Knocked Up could be one of the summer of 2007s sleeper hits. It certainly deserves the distinction.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review 91/2 Months Knocked Up is a knockout until it outstays its optimal running time. Plus The sweet insanity of Crazy Love. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Suzanne Hanover/Courtesy of Universal; Illustration by Athletics) Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) has carved out an enviable niche He makes films about boy-men in denial who are forced to face up to adult responsibilities yet along the way he gets to wallow in their geeky immaturity. He gets to be alternately grown-up and anal-expulsivea healthy design for living I submit. In Apatows disarming new comedy Knocked Up Alison (Katherine Heigl) a smart attractive and newly successful TV correspondent becomes pregnant after a drunken one-night stand and chooses both to have the baby and to try to bond with its father Ben (Seth Rogen) a titanically unsuitable dweebthe Pavarotti of stoner-losers. Its a film of deeply traditional values; it might even be taken as a parable for the postRoe v. Wade era. But Knocked Up feels very now. The banter is bruisingly funny the characters brilliantly childish the portrait of our cultures narrowing gap between children and their elders hystericalin all senses. Freaks and Geeks freaks will recognize Rogen (and Martin Starr and James Franco in a cameo as himself) and know that Apatows heart is with this overweight eyesoreeven when he lingers on Rogens huge rounded buttocks as Alison gazes on him in horror the morning after. Of course that they paired up in the first place tests our credulity As in Sideways the idea of a tall-drink-of-water blonde falling into bed with a pudgy penniless alcoholic dweeb suggests wishful thinking on the part of male filmmakers. (Dont misunderstand Those dweebs are my tribe and I endorse Jon Lovitzs Saturday Night Live exhortation to the ladies Low-er your stan-dards. Its just that the corollarycute guy and fat unattractive womanis as rare as svelte heterosexual male film critics.) Rogens Ben stands for a life of comfy self-indulgence untroubled by a need for luxury or fame. He lives in a nest of unhygienic stoners (among them Starr the Uber-nerd on Freaks and Geeks now somewhat more presentableand the object of a good running gag involving a bet a beard Islamic terrorists and Cat Stevens). He and his flatmates idly tinker with a Website that documents the nude scenes of famous actresses. Merely to watch the poised Alison pick her way around the debris of these human slugs is a hoot; its a visual oxymoron. But Apatow has the wit to depict the rest of Alisons life as a tiptoe among land mines of brattinessfrom the whiny celebrities she interviews on the E channel to the affluent sister (Leslie Mann) and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd) who represent marital stability and seethe with loathing for each other. Its against this appalling backdropand the obsession with skinniness of her network employersthat Alison decides to have her baby in spite of advice from her mother to get rid of it. That decision is never exploredit just is; and Apatow has little to say about the struggles economic and otherwise of single-motherhood. As in The 40-Year-Old Virgin he chooses to leave out the darker dimensions of his male protagonists backward behaviors. (That someone who is a virgin at 40and not for religious reasonswould be such an open friendly all-around good guy instead of a twisted self-hating misogynistic troll is more wishful thinking.) The first 100 minutes could simply not be betterbut as Knocked Up drifts over the two-hour mark a little of the air goes out of it. In between each chapter of the film are shots of the growing fetusits What to Expect When Youre Expecting The Motion Picture and it gets all goo-goo-eyed with baby-worship (a hazard in pregnancy films as in life). If youve seen one funny delivery scene youve seen them all. (Showing the baby actually coming out is as my old theater mentors used to say an interesting choiceand a really gross one.) Knocked Up is still a knockout. Apatows talent is for telling complicated truths about the peculiar ways in which people defend themselves from the pain of livingwith jokes. Jokes as deep as they are wide. A succession of OB/GYNs each nuttier and less reassuring than the last evokes all the weird anxieties of pregnancy. The network scenes kill. Having worked on The Larry Sanders Show and dealt with his share of Hollywood executives Apatow nails their passive-aggression and gets a gem of a turn out of Kristen Wiig as a producer whos manifestly jealous of Alisons on-air career Listen to how Wiig delivers neutral lines like an ace major-league pitcher taking a little something off them and turning them into screwballs. Heigl is the Alice in this wonderland of loonsand the straighter she is the funnier. Rogen never goes soft on Ben. His aversion to commitment is instinctive Hes like those men whose mates have to say Look me in the eyeand who need all the courage they can muster to maintain that contact. Leslie Manns performance is the breakout. In rare moments of repose her voice is a purr on par with Patricia Clarksons but when it stabs she and Norman Bates are all by themselves. Watch her build to a crescendo nice and easy as she fixes her eyes on her insufficiently sensitive spouse I am trying to be nice to you right now but Im struggling with it because I wanna rip your fucking head off you dipshit. Rudd plays off her perfectly offering a blank facade choosing to absent himself from the battlefield. Yet Mann is alluring damn it. Id say this was the craziest couple on screen right now except 1 2 Next Share this story...

""Knocked Up"" is uproarious. Line for line minute to minute writer-director Judd Apatows latest effort is more explosively funny more frequently than nearly any other major studio release in recent memory. Indeed even more than the filmmakers smash-hit sleeper ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" his new pic is bound to generate repeat business among ticketbuyers wholl want to savor certain scenes and situations again and again if only to memorize punchlines worth sharing with buddies. Currently set for a June 1 release this hugely commercial comedy likely will remain in megaplexes throughout the summer and possibly into the fall. The basic setup -- pregnant with comic potential naturally -- is simplicity itself Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) a contentedly underemployed slacker meets ambitious Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a trendy Los Angeles nitery. Shes feeling celebratory because of her promotion to on-camera correspondent for E Entertainment Television; hes ready to party hearty because well thats his natural state of being. One thing leads to another propelled by ample amounts of alcohol and the mismatched strangers wind up connecting for what they assume will be a one-night stand. A few weeks later however Alison discovers she is pregnant. For Ben a scruffy layabout who shares a disheveled home with four similarly slackerish stoners news of his impending fatherhood comes as a rude awakening. (Until now his primary goal has been designing a Web site listing when and where actresses appear nude in homevid movies.) For Alison pregnancy initially seems like a career impediment -- its hard to do red-carpet reports during ones third trimester -- but shes ready to accept motherhood with a little help if not a permanent commitment from the babys father. After a surprisingly smooth start however this unlikely bonding (which quickly evolves into a friendship with benefits) turns rocky. Alison has certain expectations -- for one thing shed like Ben not to get stoned quite so often -- and Ben has a few hang-ups. (During what is hands down the funniest sequence in an extremely funny movie he turns squeamish while attempting sexual congress with his extremely pregnant partner.) It doesnt help that their less-than-encouraging role models are Alisons control-freakish sister Debbie and her discontented husband Pete (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd who along with Rogen also appeared in ""Virgin""). Much of what happens next can be predicted by anyone whos seen a movie in which a feckless neer-do-well reluctantly comes of age when adult responsibility is thrust upon him (or her). What sets ""Knocked Up"" apart is Apatows gift for balancing the madcap swagger and uninhibited bawdiness of a high-testosterone farce with the unabashed sweetness and romantic yearning of a chick flick. That formula so effective in ""Virgin"" proves even more potent here. So much so that Apatow is able to sustain the pic for 132 minutes -- unusually long for a comedy -- with no visible strain and precious little filler. Apatow has a perfect-pitch ear for dialogue that is at once profanely funny persuasively colloquial and pop-culture-aware The characters repeatedly reference ""Spider-Man 3"" -- which come summer will be playing next door in the megaplex -- in precisely the ways one would expect them to reference it. Apatow relies relatively little on sight gags or physical slapstick preferring to earn his guffaws from characters revealing themselves in conversations and quarrels bull sessions and soul-bearings. The insult-heavy interplay among Ben and his roomies (well-cast Jay Baruchel Jonah Hill Jason Segel and Martin Starr) recalls the hectoring give-and-take among the title characters co-workers in ""Virgin."" But there is much to amuse during the quieter moments as well. When Ben gets his first glimpse at Alison without her clothes he exclaims with equal measures of disbelief and gratitude ""Youre prettier than I am."" That line -- which likely will cause a shock of recognition among many male ticketbuyers though few would ever admit it -- is one of many Rogen adroitly employs to construct a performance that winningly underscores Bens blunt-spoken crudity and puppy-dog sweetness. In his first starring role thesp vividly conveys both the appeal and the emptiness of eternal adolescence without ever turning too grown-up to tax believability or disappoint auds. Hes also a terrifically effective foil for Heigl who brings a compelling edge to Alisons fear and befuddlement and a ferociously funny frenzy to the characters pregnancy-fueled mood swings. Casting is spot-on from the good-sport celebs who cameo as themselves (Ryan Seacrest is fearlessly self-satirical) to fleeting bit players. Rudd makes not-so-quiet desperation even more affecting here than he did in ""The Oh in Ohio"" while Mann subtly reveals the aching dissatisfaction beneath Debbies toxic snippiness. Slick production package enhances pics overall entertainment value. Knocked UpProductionA Universal release and presentation of an Apatow production.
