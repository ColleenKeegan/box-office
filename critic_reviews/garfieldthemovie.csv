Murrays dry laconic voice is immediately recognisable as he gives life - or at least a voice - to a plumped-up CGI version of the sardonic comic strip cat. The peace of a quiet suburban world is shattered when Garfields owner Jon (Breckin Meyer) takes in a dog Odie as part of his plan to woo a local animal carer Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt). The rest is pure Tom and Jerry stuff as dog and cat compete for the space on the sofa until of course they are forced to unite against a common human evil. Without Murray the film would have much less appeal.

And a fuzzy dog. And there are no guns. So for little kids ""Garfield"" is essentially harmless unless your child finds obviously computer-generated bug-eyed rodents who quip with incessant smugness kinda scary. Essentially the cats life is upended when his owner Jon (a supremely bland Breckin Meyer) takes in a new puppy this to impress the animal doctor Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) into going out with him. When Garfield kicks the dog out of the house and the pup is kidnapped by a nefarious TV personality (Stephen Tobolowsky) who needs an animal that performs stupid pet tricks Garfield makes it his moral mission to rescue the dog and become his friend. Theres nothing to recommend about this film except its sheer innocuousness. And Bill Murrays off-screen voicing as Garfield adds no ""Robin Williams"" element to the movie. Contains nothing particularly objectionable except wan humor.

"Garfield Three-Velveeta Lasagna Reheated washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Garfield Three-Velveeta Lasagna Reheated Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 11 2004 Its been commonly noted - by this reviewer among many others - that Bill Murray would be entertaining even if he were reciting the tax tables. That thesis is just about put to the test in ""Garfield The Movie"" in which Murray while not literally cracking open a copy of United States Internal Revenue Code Title 26 is forced to recite dialogue with about as much zing. As the voice of the titular computer-generated cat he conveys all the smug snarky self-satisfaction of his persona in ""Groundhog Day."" Indeed Garfield the lazy gluttonous and self-absorbed star of the hugely popular comic strip bears a striking resemblance to ""Groundhog Days"" pompous weatherman whose spiritual awakening provided surprisingly effective fodder for comedy. Garfield too has a change of heart in his first feature film even though by the end of the movie hes still pretty fat lazy and selfish. And his transformation isnt the stuff of classic family comedy - its more like another chance to hit the multiplex with the kids once youve seen ""Shrek 2"" and the latest ""Harry Potter."" ""Garfield The Movie"" is Hollywood cog-grinding at its most uninspired - bland workmanlike and instantly forgettable. The movie opens with Garfield doing what hes best known for - lying around the house cadging snacks and manipulating his owner Jon (Breckin Meyer) into doing his bidding. Once outside he is just as imperious with his neighborhood friends; he routinely terrorizes and taunts a Doberman named Luca and he tricks a cat named Nermal into helping him steal some milk never offering his confederate a sip. (True to his literary roots Garfield is the only animated character in an otherwise live-action movie.) Frankly Garfield isnt a very nice guy. And that becomes even more clear when Jon brings another pet into the household a dog named Odie. Once this compulsive attention-grabber and affection-stealer hits the scene Garfield goes into overdrive bullying the pup off his favorite chair engaging him in a fight that turns into a dance contest and finally putting him out of the house altogether. Hurt Odie runs away from home and falls into the clutches of an unscrupulous TV personality who dresses him in a shock collar and lederhosen. (And really which is worse?) Garfield who eventually realizes that he misses his former nemesis sets out to rescue him aided and abetted by a menagerie of neighborhood animals. Its difficult to pinpoint what has made the ""Garfield"" comic strip so popular - its read by an estimated 260 million people every day - but the movie version suggests that the characters appeal may be best communicated on the page. Even when he decides to be a good guy Garfield is rather unpleasant and hes never very funny. Surely though fans will appreciate some inside jokes including gags involving lasagna (Garfields favorite food) and a shot in which he looks just like one of those obnoxious Garfield car window decals from a few years back. By far the best part of ""Garfield The Movie"" are the real-life dogs cats and mice that make up the films supporting cast especially when they stage an impressive jailbreak from the animal pound (for some viewers the best part may be Jennifer Love Hewitt as the most scantily clad animal doctor in veterinary history). Indeed in a victory for dog people everywhere the bright orange computerized ball of fur that plays Garfield is consistently upstaged by Tyler and Chloe two uncommonly gifted and charismatic mutts who play Odie. This stumpy elongated little pup steals every scene that hes in and he proves to be loads more watchable than his more famous but literally lifeless co-star. He twirls on his hind legs chases his tail and allows himself to be insulted and shoved and shunted aside by the fat cat all the time with soulful good humor. By the end of ""Garfield The Movie"" the title character is just a distracting orange blur. Considering this breakout performance the movie company may want to consider a new advertising tag line Youll come for the cat but youll stay for the dog. Garfield The Movie - (86 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG.

Tepid kidpic based on long-running comic strip about a lasagna-loving cat and his chronically clueless owner will be hard-pressed to generate even respectable matinee biz during theatrical play. A correction was made to this review on June 14 2004. Only very small children still easily impressed by interaction of human actors and CGI quadrupeds will be amused by ""Garfield The Movie."" Tepid kidpic based on long-running comic strip about a lasagna-loving cat and his chronically clueless owner will be hard-pressed to generate even respectable matinee biz during theatrical play. To attract maximum potential aud Fox will have to wait until this kitty litters vidstore shelves. Casting Bill Murray as the voice for Garfield the famously indolent orange tabby may have seemed promising in pitch meetings. On the screen however seemingly perfect match-up has at best modestly funny payoff. It doesnt help much that even while cracking wise or tossing insults Murray sounds curiously disengaged if not downright bored. But it helps even less that except for greatly improved f/x drearily retro pic resembles nothing so much as a lesser live-action Disney comedy of 30 years ago. Opening scenes dutifully establish computer-generated Garfield as a lazy feline who easily manipulates Jon (Breckin Meyer) his nominal owner and just about every other animal in his neighborhood. (Cats dogs and even mice are portrayed by real critters enhanced with CGI tweaking.) Trouble arises in paradise only when Jon -- eager to impress Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) a leggy veterinarian -- agrees to adopt Odie a pint-sized mongrel in need of a good home. Not surprisingly Garfield resents having to share Jons affections with what he indelicately dubs a ""dumb animal."" (Unlike Garfield and his four-legged friends who freely converse with each other without being understood by humans Odie cant talk.) But the yapping canine responds to Garfields every put-down or push-off with avid affection and happy-go-lucky glee. Indeed Odie even learns to mimic Garfields disco-dance moves. Unfortunately his frisky footwork attracts the attention of Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky) a local TV personality who seizes the pooch as his ticket to network stardom. Directed with minimal pizzazz by Pete Hewitt (""Bill and Teds Bogus Journey"") from a bland script by Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow (""Cheaper by the Dozen"") pic lopes along at torpid pace as Garfield tries to redeem himself by rescuing Odie. Alan Cumming and Jimmy Kimmel are among the notables who earn mild chuckles while speaking for other animals. Human co-stars go through their motions without embarrassing or distinguishing themselves. Overall ""Garfield The Movie"" looks cheerlessly drab even with a pudgy orange cat bouncing off the walls. The juxtaposition of CGI creatures with flesh-and-blood characters is generally seamless yet surprisingly unremarkable. Pic inadvertently serves as a cautionary object lesson Novelty value of such high-tech trickery simply isnt what it used to be.

The cats pajamas Garfield takes luxurious breaks from his task of searching for the missing dog Odie. Rhythm amp; Hues Garfield The Movie   Not even Bill Murray could save Garfield. Perhaps the comedian -- so pitch-perfect as the sardonic actor in Lost in Translation -- got too deeply into character. In voicing the lazy fat cat he didnt draw upon his own distinctive wit to add heft (or subtlety) to the felines one-liners. Instead Murray delivers bland recitations. Visually the lasagna-loving feline comes to life capably enough via computer. Every other creature is human or animal and the humans do a much less professional job than their four-footed counterparts. Garfield is loving his lackadaisical existence until his owner (the blandly pleasant Breckin Meyer) brings home a dog Odie whom fans of the comic strip will remember as Garfields nemesis. The slyly clever Garfield casts the lovable mutt out one night then is struck by guilt and drags himself off the couch to hit the streets in search of the peppy pooch. But Odie has fallen into the clutches of a conniving local TV show host (an over-the-top Stephen Tobolowsky). There are chases fights and a host of adorable and noble beasts coming to Odies rescue. Still the movie falls flat. Garfields tagline is ""Its all about me-ow"" The emphasis should be on the ""ow"" (PG brief mild language) -- Claudia Puig Napoleon Dynamite   1/2 There isnt much Napoleonic grandeur in this Idaho-set high school comedy which in spite of its most condescending instincts does have its moments. It helps to approach this debut feature and Sundance hit in the context of being shot on a small-town dime. When we watch geeky Napoleon (Jon Heder) get shocked by a so-called time machine (mostly metal batteries and headwear) one does have to concede an attitude often missing from pricier screen endeavors. Yet husband-wife team (Jared and Jerusha Hess) apparently have no love in their hearts for the no-hopes theyve created. Napoleon is socially maladroit and is a constant pummeling target for standard-issue jocks. His uncle (a funny Jon Gries) is a jock wannabe convinced he should have been an NFL quarterback instead of a salesman of plastic dishes. Meanwhile Napoleons pal Pedro (Efren Ramirez) is in over his head running for class president against a vapid school queen (Haylie Duff Hilarys sister).). The Hesses who are only in their mid-20s know how to set up gags and even capitalize on them. But their opening salvo seems outrageous just for the sake of it. In Fourth of July terms its pop is less dynamite than firecracker.

""Garfield"" the movie. Take a catnap till its over / Fake-looking feline stars in lazy adaptation of comic strip 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Garfield The Movie Comedy. Directed by Peter Hewitt. With Breckin Meyer JenniferLove Hewitt and the voice of Bill Murray. (Rated PG. 75 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Buried somewhere in a vault at Fox is a secret memo explaining why the studio decided to make ""Garfield The Movie."" Until that document surfaces the reason will remain a mystery. Besides the least-demanding small fry few will take joy in this misbegotten comedy about the notoriously fat and lazy comic strip cat. Theres something jarring about the films mixture of live and computer-generated images and this Garfield -- the only CGI character in the movie -- doesnt even look that good. The acting is standard-issue Disney Channel and as for the plot it would be tricky to pad it out for a half-hour episode of the well-regarded ""Garfield and Friends"" TV series. The movie also comes as an unhappy surprise because in 1997 the director Peter Hewitt made a pretty decent family picture from Mary Nortons novel ""The Borrowers."" (Then again six years earlier he had directed ""Bill amp; Teds Bogus Journey."") ""Garfield"" looks like the work of someone whos hardly seen the backside of a camera. Breckin Meyer plays Jon Garfields zhlub of an owner and the target of his mockery. Jennifer Love Hewitt portrays Jons love interest the perky veterinarian who instigates what plot there is by asking Jon to take care of a dog shes inherited. The canine turns out to be the dimwitted Odie Garfields favorite victim. Theres also a villain a low-rent TV personality (Stephen Tobolowsky) who kidnaps Odie hoping the pup will be his ticket to stardom. Guess which of the neighborhood felines goes on a rescue mission? Which brings us to the star of the show Bill Murray (or more precisely his voice). Its easy to see why the producers tagged Murray as Garfield -- his acerbic and derisive persona is perfect for the kind of insults Garfield always hurls at Odie (""Whatre you looking at tick boy?""). Too bad Murray has only a handful of modestly funny wisecracks here. Related Stories Garfield The Movie In fact the biggest reaction at a recent screening where the audience included lots of youngsters was for a scene where Garfield and Odie boogie down on their hind legs. There was also some excitement over a slapstick chase sequence set at a dog show. This is what happens when moviemakers shop in the bargain basement at the comedy store. The computer-generated Garfields interactions with the humans and with the real animals playing Odie and Garfields cat friends never generate any magic but simply emphasize the artificial stuffed-toy look of our hero. Nothing really works here and nobody seems to have put in a huge amount of effort except maybe the marketing department -- there are many product placements. -- Advisory The film contains some mildly offensive language.

"Lacking big laughs Garfield goes to the dogs - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Lacking big laughs Garfield goes to the dogs By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  June 11 2004 ""Garfield The Movie"" isnt a crime against nature like last Decembers ""The Cat in the Hat."" It will please younger children -- who really only require that a film move fast make sense and be colorful -- while keeping their older siblings inoffensively narcotized for 75 minutes. Adults may find it a toothless harmless mostly charmless mongrel movie that mixes live-action actors and animals with a computer-generated version of the comic strip cat that Jim Davis created in 1978 and has since cross-marketed into the ground. But at least its not Dr. Seuss this movie limply sells out -- just a strip that may be the most laugh-free item on the funnies page next to ""Cathy.""Maybe Im being unkind; a black-dressing young intellectual of my acquaintance recently ascribed a ""lazy generosity"" to Garfield and his daily antics. If so the movie gets the laziness but misses the generosity. Bill Murray appears only as the voice of Garfield and truth be told the actors goofball irony dovetails well with the felines lasagna-loving egotism.But Murray can tap dance in midair only so long without decent dialogue and sorry ""I think Im going to blow Cat Chow chunks"" isnt Charles M. Schulz let alone Shakespeare. ""Garfield The Movie"" doles out pop-culture references a la ""Shrek"" but James Brown imitations Elvis poses and ""You had me at `hello "" arent actual jokes theyre just a way to get laughs without doing any work. The story line? I liked it better when it was called ""Toy Story 2."" Garfields naive doofus of an owner Jon (Breckin Meyer) brings home a stray dog mostly because hes tongue-tied with love for perky veterinarian Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt). In a brave artistic departure from the comic strip Odie is a live-action mutt played sans voiceover by the certifiably real Tyler whos half dachshund half cairn terrier and all ham.Through a series of twists the jealous Garfield kicks Odie out of Jons house and the talented dog is scooped up by Happy Chapman (character actor Stephen Tobolowsky) a sadistic local TV newsman looking for an animal act. Heres where ""Garfield"" moves into seriously actionable territory cat needs to rescue dog before bad guy gets on a train for New York so he crosses a busy street under cover of a plastic mail bin climbs through the ductwork of a midtown skyscraper and pops out through a vent. Later theres a climactic showdown in the luggage-sorting area of the train station. Sound familiar? Pixars lawyers might think so. Ah you say but the little kids understand. Perhaps. I attended ""Garfield The Movie"" in the company of a third-grade girls soccer team most of whom sat there with the engrossed uninvolved faces kids get after the fourth straight hour of Nickelodeon. As the credits rolled the girls all claimed to have had a good time but its my experience that you can take the true measure of a family film on the drive home. If its a hit theyll still be talking about it enthusiastically comparing their favorite scenes and acting out the funny bits. On this drive they talked about everything except ""Garfield.""When I asked them what they thought of the movie I got the blank stares that said it had already been forgotten. Note ""Garfield The Movie"" is preceded in theaters by ""Gone Nutty"" a silent five-minute computer-animated short starring the acorn-obsessed ""Ice Age"" character named Scrat. It contains more real belly laughs than anything in the feature that follows. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Garfield | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Vicki Lewis Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; garfield ) Garfield (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli If there was a single thought prominent in my mind as I watched Garfield The Movie it was ""Why?"" Not so much ""why"" I was there (although my decision to get up early on a Saturday morning to attend this screening might be a cause for concern) but ""why"" this film was committed to celluloid in the first place. Is Fox so desperate for family-friendly fare that they were willing to greenlight the transformation of a marginally witty comic strip character into a CGI abomination? Or are they seeking to have their own version of Howard the Duck? Either way the result is a motion picture so ungainly and awful that only an under-8 child could appreciate it. The story is simple enough for a toddler to follow. Garfield (whose voice is provided by Bill Murray) the smart-aleck cat with an appetite and an attitude is stricken with an extreme case of jealousy when his human best-friend Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) adopts a dog named Odie (probably short for Odious). Garfield eager to re-establish his turf and eject the interloper causes Odie to run away. Then overcome by guilt he follows the canine to the big city to rescue him from Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky) a local TV personality who has dognapped Odie. Jon and his veterinarian girlfriend Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are hot in pursuit. Its harder to imagine a more second-rate production than what we are given with Garfield. The director is Peter Hewitt whose career highlight is Bill and Teds Bogus Journey but whose most recent outing was something called Thunderpants. The stars are a has-been Jennifer Love Hewitt and a never-was Breckin Meyer. And the title character is based on a comic strip that was hot about 15 years ago (the Emmy-winning animated TV series was made in 1988). For agreeing to do the voice of Garfield Bill Murray must have been lost somewhere if not necessarily in translation. (Although Murray is adequate to the task of delivering the cats acerbic one-liners Steven Wright probably would have been a better selection.) Garfield The Movie is a prime example of what happens when theres too little source material for a movie screenplay. To be sure there are occasional moments of rare wit (perhaps as the result of lines lifted directly from Jim Davis daily strips) but the production as a whole is several notches below uninspired and in the same neighborhood as unnecessary. Four or five chuckles during 82 minutes is not an acceptable quotient even for a childrens film - especially since Garfield (the penciled character) is widely viewed as being smart and hip enough to attract an adult audience. Then theres the questionable decision of how to render Garfield. Computer generated imaging (CGI) has been in fairly widespread use since Steven Spielberg employed it to bring dinosaurs to life in Jurassic Park. In the past 11 years CGI has undergone a series of improvements yet inexplicably the work in Garfield looks like it was done circa 1993. Its often clunky and unconvincing and frequently meshes imperfectly with the live action elements (watch when a human is supposedly carrying Garfield). Additionally presumably to keep the cost down Garfield is the only animal that is animated. The rest of the feline canine and rodent cast is comprised of real animals whose lips are manipulated to allow them to speak. This causes Garfield to stand out. (Although there are times when Jennifer Love Hewitt is stiff enough to make us wonder if she too is a computer representation.) The lesson here is not to go half-way - either animate all of the animals or none of them. It might seem like a small thing but its strangely disconcerting - although perhaps not as disconcerting as the non-stop stream of product placements (Petco Walmart Amtrack etc.). One would think that filmmakers attempting to make a movie with a talking animal as the main character would take their inspiration from Babe not Howard. And for those who remain from the late-80s throng of Garfield devotees this does not represent the realization of a long-awaited dream. So little of Jim Davis cat remains in this treacly screenplay that its almost criminal. This a neutered Garfield one part tomcat and three parts pussy recognizable only by his orange coat and love of lasagna. This felines got a serious case of mange.

It features Scrat the fanged beastie and about 1000 acorns (at one point he attempts to knock them into a cushion while hurtling toward the ground) and its a marvel of slapstick kinetic physics. The only downside? It makes the cloddish unfunny dud that is ""Garfield"" look even worse. On paper at least Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield sounded like an inspired idea His vaguely decadent singsong meshes snugly with the comic-strip fat cats lazy-eyed blase narcissism. But Murray has been given nothing to deliver other than a series of exceedingly lame tyke-friendly wisecracks. When Garfields owner the redoubtable Jon (Breckin Meyer) brings home a dachshund mutt named Odie the jealous Garfield exclaims ""You had me a chick magnet and now youve got a tick magnet"" Its enough to make you long for the wit and wisdom of Mike Myers ""Cat in the Hat."" Garfield while animated with supple proficiency moves through a cheaply photographed suburban landscape in which hes the only creature - feline canine or human - who enjoys the luxury of a personality. Thats one very long stupid pet trick.
