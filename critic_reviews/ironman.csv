ZADE ROSENTHAL MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT Iron ManStars Robert Downey Jr. Terrence Howard Gwyneth Paltrow Jeff BridgesBehind the scenes Directed by Jon Favreau from a script by Mark Fergus Hawk Ostby Art Marcum and Matt Holloway.Playing Opens Friday May 2 throughout Orange County. CLICK HERE FOR MOVIE TIMESRated PG-13 (some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and brief suggestive content)Running time 2 hours 1 minuteThe quick hitAction fans steel yourself for fun. Robert Downey Jr. gives an uproarious career-resuscitating performance in Jon Favreaus smash-mouth salute to the armor-clad Marvel superhero. Grade A-Now playing in Orange County Starring the likes of Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard ""Iron Man"" boasts the kind of rarified call sheet one would typically associate with an Oscar-customized ensemble drama not a smash-mouth sci-fi blockbuster about a guy in flying robot suit. But there Downey and Co. are - with their seven collective Oscar nominations - slumming it to superb effect in director Jon Favreaus roaring adaptation of the long-running Marvel comic. For once the summer movie season is starting off on the right foot - even if the foot happens to be encased in armor and equipped with rocket thrusters.And yes the cast rocks. Led by Downeys career-resurrecting performance as billionaire weapons peddler Tony Stark it proves just as indispensable to the movies giddy escapist appeal as the seamless CGI effects and eye-popping pyrotechnics. Indeed after the fact its hard to think of anybody but the ""Chaplin"" star playing Stark a fast-living sharp-witted genius playboy who brags about bagging Maxim models and likes to dazzle military brass by test-firing his own mountain-destroying munitions. ""Peace is about having a bigger stick than the other guy"" says the enfant-terrible of stick-making just before whisking another conquest back to his cliffside Malibu digs with its state-of-the-art auto showroom and robotics fabrication plant. Hes like Howard Hughes reborn as a skirt-chasing gear-head. Necessarily Stark gets a taste of his own medicine when hes ambushed and kidnapped in Afghanistan by a multi-national terrorist clique. Fortunately its an extraordinarily stupid multi-national terrorist clique one that sticks the near-mortally-wounded Stark in a cave with a massive cache of his own weapons and orders him to build a doomsday weapon. Hey thats thinkin.So director Favreau (""Elf"") and a quartet of screenwriters (including ""Children of Men"" scripters Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby) dont perfectly finesse Starks superhero transformation. We still get it. Stark with newfound humility and a glowing pace-maker that keeps his damaged heart from seizing emerges from the cave/chrysalis with a radical vision for corporate responsibility and a prototype for the lethal red-and-gold bodysuit that will become his Iron Man legacy. The new-look Stark also creates intriguing fault lines of loyalty among his confidantes his mentor and Stark Industries chairman Obadiah Stane (Bridges) his protA(c)gA(c) and Pentagon liaison Jim Rhodes (Howard) and faithful secretly-smitten assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow).Which of these characters will pilot the gargantuan metal nemesis that Stark in the movies thrilling metal-twisting climax must ultimately face?

Comments click to enlarge Iron Man Video 2008 Could there be a more American superhero than Iron Man? Hes not just a crime fighter hes a weapons system. This adaptation of the long-running Marvel Comics series directed by Jon Favreau is steeped in machine tooling and digital information screens with men doing battle while bolted inside gigantic high-tech metal contraptions. Robert Downey Jr. gives a nicely sardonic performance as Tony Stark a rich playboy and the brilliant heir to his fathers weapons manufacturing dynasty. The movie is so clever and smoothly paced that its easy to overlook the odious story line in which Stark suffers an attack of conscience during a disastrous trip to Afghanistan realizes his corporation is supplying Taliban-like bad guys and goes after them in his iron death suit. Of course coming back to destroy his own stuff makes him the perfect metaphor for the U.S. an irony Favreau ignores. With Jeff Bridges Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard. PG-13 126 min. By J.R.

"Review Iron Man packs a terrific punch - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Iron Man packs a terrific punchStory Highlights CNN.coms Tom Charity ""Iron Man"" delivers the goods Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as dissolute billionaire Tony Stark Movie has wit and energy isnt overwhelmed by action Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- You might attribute it to 9/11 or simply blame director Joel Schumacher whose camp take on ""Batman"" derailed that franchise for several years. But lately Hollywood superhero movies have taken themselves awfully seriously. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark a billionaire who remakes himself into ""Iron Man."" Ang Lee Bryan Singer and Christopher Nolan have produced solemn almost morbid versions of the Hulk Superman and Batman respectively. Even Sam Raimi succumbed to this gravity in the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy. Enter Robert Downey Jr. riding to the rescue a glass of Scotch in his hand and a sardonic smile on his lips. As everyone knows Downey is not the hero type. Not in his public persona and not on screen either where his dissipated narcissism has been most often effective in supporting roles (""Zodiac"" ""A Scanner Darkly"" ""Wonder Boys""). Downey is one of those actors who likes to doodle in the margins to ad-lib and fool around instincts that give Jon Favreaus ""Iron Man"" movie an immediate fillip. The stars bad-boy past becomes part and parcel of the characters redemption drama This is where he shows his true mettle. One of the lesser-known Marvel heroes Iron Man is basically Batman in a shiny new suit and a more global perspective. Like Bruce Wayne Tony Stark is a wealthy industrialist a weapons manufacturer with the means and know-how to create his own impregnable armor (Stan Lee allegedly based him on Howard Hughes). Iron Man made his debut in 1963 when he was captured by the Viet Cong and put to work. Dont Miss EW.com Best comic-book movies ever Summers superheroes have some ... issues Forty-five years later the theater of war has shifted to Afghanistan but the same mechanics are in play. Stark is demonstrating his latest smart bomb -- part of the ""Freedom"" line -- when he falls into the hands of a murderous warlord who turns out to have a well-stocked arsenal of Stark hardware. The warlord then demands his own homemade weapon of mass destruction. Badly wounded Stark feigns compliance but actually hammers out the prototype for a bulletproof jet-suit that he uses to escape. In the original comics Starks brush with mortality only made him angry; he took the war to the Commies. Favreaus reconstructed Iron Man is still a human gun but hes no longer gung-ho exactly. Hes more of an aggressive pacifist. Back in the USA he announces hes a changed man embraces nonviolence and joins a Buddhist commune. OK Im kidding but not by much He announces that Stark Industries is quitting the arms trade. As the stock plummets he quietly holes up in his modernist Malibu home to perfect his one-man missile defense system. True to type Downey has a ball as the cavalier playboy in the early scenes. This Tony Stark is so much fun to be around were almost sorry to see his transformation take place. Or we would be if not for Downeys deliciously deft physical performance which insists that the melding of man and machine is no walk in the park. However his business partner Obadiah Stane (a splendidly bald bearded Jeff Bridges) is unhappy about the change. Its not difficult to guess where this is heading -- Marvel stories are all permutations on a handful of stock scenarios -- but Favreau doesnt blow it up any more than he has to. In ""Elf"" and ""Zathura"" he showed he could integrate special effects and carry the story but like Downey hes almost always looking for a comic spin. A scene in which Tony invites his assistant Pepper Potts (an appealingly valiant Gwyneth Paltrow) to reach into the hole in his chest and fix his battery is a cheeky cocktail of trust disgust love sex fear and courage (its also a key plant for subsequent developments) but above all it plays funny. When a movie is firing on all those cylinders you know its a winner. The character stuff is so light on its feet that the action scenes seem flat in comparison -- the effects are first-rate but theyre nothing we havent seen before and the climactic showdown is a bit heavy-handed (if satisfyingly crunchy). Even so ""Iron Man"" is a supremely confident well-tooled entertainment. Its bound to be the early pace-maker for the oncoming glut of summer blockbusters. ""Iron Man"" is rated PG-13 and runs 126 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

Zade Rosenthal/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Zade Rosenthal/Paramount Pictures Snark attack Iron Mans strength lies largely in its heros attitude. Zade Rosenthal/Paramount Pictures Director Jon Favreau Genre Action Running Time 126 minutes Watch a Clip Kenneth Turans Take David Edelsteins Take The snark in most superhero movies resides mostly with the villains -- Spidey slings more webs than sarcasm; Superman would rather land punches than punchlines. But with Robert Downey Jr. wearing Iron Mans armor there was never any doubt that this new Marvel franchise would make its snarkiness central. No one throws away a line with more style than Downey -- not even Daniel Craig the latest James Bond model -- and the dozen or so screenwriters it took to turn this comic book story into a storyline have given him plenty to throw away as Tony Stark irrepressibly irresponsible gazillionaire munitions-maker. Director Jon Favreau blows up a lot of stuff right at the top then takes his time establishing characters -- Terrence Howard as Starks comparatively down-to-earth best bud Gwyneth Paltrow as his lovesick secretary Jeff Bridges as his nemesis -- and more time getting the hero into that metal suit. Downey proves hilariously limber in the Blake Edwards-ish slapstick with which he finally learns to fly but the plot proves less limber especially in a routine wrap-up where a pair of bulging metalmen have at each other digitally. Early on though when bad boy Stark is trying to rehabilitate himself and Downeys bad-boy rep is dovetailing neatly the movie zips along. If every superhero franchise had a Robert Downey Jr. the genre might actually be watchable again.

Industrial Light and Magic/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Industrial Light and Magic/Paramount Pictures After learning of an evil plot that threatens the worlds safety Tony Stark uses his super-armored suit to foil the plan and protect the world as Iron Man. Industrial Light and Magic/Paramount Pictures Its May and the season of summer movies is upon us and this year the march of the would-be blockbusters begins with the debut of Marvel Studios much-ballyhooed Iron Man. Wait ""Iron Man""? This is the name for a superhero? Shouldnt the handle for a fighter for truth and justice be something sleek and modern like ""Titanium Man""? Or even ""Uranium Al""? Isnt ""Iron Man"" a little old-school for todays computer-generated movie franchise world? Dont tell that to the folks at super-profitable Marvel Studios. So here comes Iron Man following gamely in the footsteps of Spider-Man X-Men Fantastic Four The Incredible Hulk and Daredevil. Robert Downey Jr. gives an engaging performance as billionaire playboy Tony Stark a second-generation inventor and armaments manufacturer. Hes the kind of guy who divides his time between womanizing and accepting accolades for being a visionary genius and American patriot. Iron Man also offers some slick verbal sparring between Stark and his loyal assistant Pepper Potts -- yes that really is her name. (Shes played by Gwyneth Paltrow.) But though its hero is named after an element this movie is an alloy a combination of disconnected components. Two different writing teams worked on separate but equal versions of the script and that ""One from Column A one from Column B"" approach just doesnt work. There are simply too many Tony Starks.

By Joe Morgenstern July 22 2011 If you want to be literal-minded about it--I dont--heres the most obvious problem with ""Another Earth"" The planet of the title an apparent duplicate of our own has suddenly appeared in the sky and just floats there serenely at a safe remove as if the law of gravity had been repealed. Other far-fetched notions turn up regularly; this small-scale film has more outsize ideas than it could possibly manage. Yet Mike Cahills debut feature exerts a gravitational pull out of proportion to its size through powerful performances a lyrical spirit a succession of arresting images and a depth of conviction that sweeps logic aside. ENLARGE Brit Marling in Another Earth Fox Searchlight Exactly what that extraterrestrial Terra represents is hard to pin down--a way of looking at ourselves a chance to rerun our lives with different outcomes. String theory suggests the existence of infinite numbers of movies inspired by the notion of alternate universes and this is one of them. Still the presence of what comes to be called Earth 2 is incidental to a human story that plays out on Earth 1 and the cosmic overtones are less impressive than the emergence of a startlingly fine young actress named Brit Marling. Ms. Marling who wrote the script with Mr. Cahill and served as one of the producers has not been widely known on this planet until now but thats about to change. She plays Rhoda Williams a former student of great intelligence and boundless promise who buries herself in menial labor to atone for having done something dreadful and presumably irreversible. William Mapother--he made a relatively small role memorable in ""In the Bedroom""--is John Burroughs a composer whose life has been devastated by something dreadful and presumably irreversible. Does this sound dreadfully formulaic? It is but it also isnt because the actors and their director invest almost every moment with spellbinding urgency even when Rhoda and John are having spontaneous fun--a lively interlude turns on video boxing--or starting to light up each others lives. Until now Mr. Cahill has been mainly a cinematographer on nature films and a director of documentaries. Like Ms. Marling who has co-directed documentaries with him he studied economics at Georgetown. (She was also an investment-banking analyst at Goldman Sachs which proves the infinite unpredictability of career paths.) I dont know where either of them learned their spare specific approach to drama but its a pleasure to see how the acting anchors a tale that might otherwise have spun off weightless into realms celebrated by Carl Sagan. Take the scene in which Ms. Marling tells a story in her musical voice about a Russian cosmonaut. Its only a story and a slender one at that but it becomes a demonstration of the storytellers art that starts slowly and intimately pulls you in picks up speed and ends in a blaze of elation. In one of Mr. Mapothers surprising turns he plays a soul-filling solo on a musical saw. The tones may have been electronically enhanced but the scene like so many others keeps you watching intently. I dont want to oversell ""Another Earth."" A few passages like one involving a venerable janitor feel downright pretentious while the mysterious apparition of Earth 2 promises a profundity that doesnt pay off. (And when Rhoda and John peer at the nearby planet through an amateur telescope why in this world dont they open the window to see it more clearly?) All the same a small smart movie that keeps you watching intently is a big deal. Captain America The First Avenger Watch a clip of Universal Studios Captain America. In its early stretches this revenant from the early days of Marvel Comics brings a spectacular sense of design to the World War II era and sparkles with ambition; theres even a production number reminiscent of old Warner Brothers musicals. Chris Evans is quietly engaging as Steve Rogers the physical weakling with the indomitable spirit--Steves digitized scrawniness is spectacular too--who is scientifically transformed into Captain America the supersoldier with the vibranium shield that absorbs all vibrations. Hugo Weaving is Red Skull the Nazi villain bent on winning the war with dark science. (""Hail Hydra"" his underlings bark invoking the name of his secret research group.) Stanley Tucci as a Nazi scientist who defected to our side demonstrates the delicate art of understatement. Once Captain America goes off to war in his endearingly silly suit however the movie which was directed by Joe Johnston from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely starts to lose its vibe. ENLARGE Chris Evans in the superhero duds of Captain America Paramount Pictures This is truly a loss. America needs distinctive alternatives to all those comic-book movies that seem to have been written by the same computer and concocted in the same CGI shops. So why cant ""Captain America"" stay the course? The reasons are disparate but cumulative action that grows ponderous and repetitive; a color palette that goes unaccountably dull; a production design that turns claustrophobic; a pallid performance by Hayley Atwell as the training officer Peggy Carter; a lazy one by Tommy Lee Jones as Steves commanding officer Col. Chester Phillips. Mostly though its a matter of pace. Captain Americas metabolism Peggy tells him burns energy four times faster than the average persons. The movies metabolism burns out. Sarahs Key Sarahs Key takes place in modern-day Paris a journalist (Kristen Scott Thomas) finds her life becoming entwined with a young girl whose family was torn apart during the notorious Vel dHiv Roundup in 1942. In these ahistorical times when the present perceives the past dimly if at all historical novels may use a contemporary hook to engage their readers. That strategy worked well enough in the Tatiana de Rosnay novel this movie is based on but not so well in the screen version which was directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner from a script he wrote with Serge Joncour. Kristin Scott Thomas is Julia Jarmond an American journalist in Paris who in the course of writing a magazine piece about occupied France during World War II discovers secrets that shatter the outward stability of her own life. Ms. Scott Thomas is as intelligent and attractive as ever but the synthetic world her character inhabits cant compete with a harrowing past that depicts French complicity in Nazi atrocities a Sophies choice confronting a tender child and a literal skeleton in a closet to emphasize all the metaphorical ones. ENLARGE Kristin Scott Thomas confronts a dark moment of history in Sarahs Key. The Weinstein Company The subject of the piece that Julia sets out to write is the notorious Vel dHiv Roundup of 1942 when French police arrested some 13000 French Jews confined them in an indoor cycling stadium for five days without food or adequate water then sent most of them on their way to Auschwitz. The horror of this event is personified by Sarah a ten-year-old girl played with heartbreaking clarity by Melusine Mayance. (Niels Arestrup and Dominique Frot play the elderly couple who give her succor.) The present-day story by contrast is cluttered with clumsy scenes in magazine offices (""I would just let sleeping dogs lie"" a callow photographer advises Julia); marital conflicts that seem inconsequential in the films larger context and plot contrivances that may have passed for intricacies in the book but now ring as false as Sarahs story rings true. She is the films beating heart and with all due respect to Ms. Scott Thomas its only heroine. DVD FOCUS ""Moon"" (2009) ENLARGE Heres another small smart film with a sci-fi theme and a vital albeit ambiguous center. Sam Rockwell is Sam Bell an astronaut nearing the end of a three-year tour of solitary duty on the moon where hes been supervising machines that mine helium for fusion power on Earth. Suddenly he falls ill then discovers that hes not alone. Another Sam Bell has appeared insisting that hes not a clone. Given a cryptic script--by Nathan Parker--about the elusive question of human identity Mr. Rockwell tops one terrific performance with another. Duncan Jones directed deftly. ""Iron Man"" (2008) Marvel Comics plus star quality equals two scintillating hours of movie (minus if truth be told a few minutes of foolishness in a climactic battle). Robert Downey Jr. works marvels on his own as Tony Stark an arms manufacturer with a genius I.Q. who reinvents himself as a knight in space-age armor righting the worlds wrongs as he soars through the skies in his cyborg suit. Gwyneth Paltrow is Tonys assistant Pepper Potts a woman of substance as well as style despite her Bond-girl moniker. Jon Favreau directed a cast that includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. ""Lacombe Lucien"" (1974) The moral dimension is missing from the hero a 17-year-old peasant boy but not from Louis Malles profound study of guilt and innocence in occupied France. Lucien played by Pierre Blaise is an emotional and cultural infant. Unknown to himself and opaque to those around him he becomes a Nazi collaborator after being turned down by the French Resistance. A more accessible film on the same subject ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" grew out of Malles experience as a young student at a private school on the grounds of a Carmelite monastery that sheltered Jewish students from Nazi deportation.

Photo Credit Zade Rosenthal Photo Photo Credit Zade Rosenthal Movie review Iron Man sizzles 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Iron Man Sci-fi action. Starring Robert Downey Jr. Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow. Directed by Jon Favreau. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""Iron Man"" is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. Its the best movie of its kind since the second ""Spider-Man"" movie four years ago. Getting the suit right is easy. Getting the man underneath the suit right - that was the challenge and the filmmakers rose to it. Robert Downey Jr. - cynical witty blithe covering up some underlying vulnerability with a smoke screen of banter - is an ideal Iron Man and an ideal actor to place at the center of this story. With Downey there the whole movie is a blast. When the action is fast and furious theres the fun of spectacle and in the calmer moments theres Downey whose dialogue is essentially a series of deadpan one-liners. That the whole movie feels ad-libbed is in fact a tribute to Downey either way. To the extent its ad-libbed its evidence of his wit. To the extent it isnt is evidence of the place he has come to occupy in our movies that his casting should automatically inspire the screenwriters (Mark Fergus Hawk Ostby Art Marcum and Matt Holloway) to come up with Robert Downey-type lines ""Give me a Scotch Im starving."" Director Jon Favreau is smart enough to let Downey puncture the pomposity of the sci-fi genre but hes also smart enough to meet the genres demands. The action is big high-stakes and not played for laughs. The fact that the spectacle has its basis in character and that Downey is such a likable presence makes the action scenes all the more effective. This time its personal - for the audience too. The movie tells a story grounded in real world 2008. The scene is Afghanistan and Tony Stark (Downey) a billionaire arms dealer is coming back from a successful demonstration of his latest weapon (missiles that flatten mountains thus making it difficult for terrorists to hide in caves). Hes chatting with soldiers in an armored truck when the bad guys attack and hes taken hostage. The Iron Man suit is the product of necessity. The terrorists give Stark the equipment to reproduce the superweapon - they want it for themselves. But he tricks them and instead of building missiles he builds an armored suit that shoots fire bullets and missiles and that flies through jet propulsion. He comes back from the experience a changed man a pacifist but not a boring pacifist. Hes willing to kill everybody it takes to defend his pacifism. At their worst comic book heroes translate into flat cartoon characters in movies. But at their best comic book characters have what Spider-Man has and what Stark has as well - a neurotic forlorn eccentricity thats very distinct to the whole comic book thing. Stark has great frustrations. Hes brilliant. Hes essentially a loner. Hes full of inner stress and this makes him into a pressure cooker whose eruption will take the form of flamboyant action. Theres an element of social commentary at work in this. You want to know how irrational the world is? Its so irrational that the most rational response a concerned genius can come up with is to perfect an iron suit and get into fantastic sky battles - and fantastic they are. For all of the movies wit ""Iron Man"" delivers on the spectacle with Iron Man dodging jet fighters in one scene and going head-to-head against an even stronger Iron Man in another. Along the way theres the kick of watching Stark develop the Iron Man suit in his basement laboratory - a funny slapstick process of getting the bugs out. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Starks personal assistant and she turns out to be exactly the co-star Downey needs - sincere where hes arch but someone with the sensitive awareness to grasp what hes really saying as well as the humor to appreciate how he says it. Jeff Bridges as Starks business partner sports some atypical facial topiary for this adventure. His head is shaved bald and he has a gray beard and though he does a lot of smiling in the early scenes something about him (besides the hair) just isnt reassuring. Bridges has mastered an art perfected by Kris Kristofferson He knows how to grin merrily while keeping his eyes cold as death. -- AdvisoryAction violence and unpleasant medical procedures.

Joe Neumaier Thursday May 1 2008 749 PM Iron Man. A wealthy weapons expert builds superhero armor to fight evil. With Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Terrence Howard Jeff Bridges. Director Jon Favreau (205). PG-13 Violence explosions. At area theaters. Theres really not a lot of Iron Man in ""Iron Man"" the latest Marvel Comics creation to hit the screen. But thats okay - the summers first blockbuster is essentially ""The Robert Downey Jr. Show"" which is always a blast.When a rock-em sock-em first hour is added as well as yes a few fantastic Iron Man fight sequences the result is the first comic-book movie in a while that actually feels like a classic comic book fast furious and flip. Forget about superheroes with love problems and tortured souls. Downey is Tony Stark a millionaire arms inventor who while giving a weapons demonstration to troops in Afghanistan is attacked and kidnapped. Shoved in a cave by terrorists who give him a week to build a rocket from spare parts Stark - who now has a magnetized sphere in his chest that keeps shrapnel in his body from entering his aorta - instead constructs a tank-suit that looks like the Michelin Man and boasts more goodies than a Swiss Army knife. Back home at his L.A. mountaintop bachelor pad (which of course has a workshop General Motors would kill for) Stark experiences a true change of heart deciding to stop making war machines. So he builds a suit of armor that flies like a jet shoots energy blasts and helps keep his ticker going as he fights injustice. The fact that Iron Man is a B-lister in the Marvel Comics stable doesnt stop director Jon Favreau and his writers from aiming high and generally hitting the target. Meanwhile Starks inner circle - including Gwyneth Paltrow (sexy and bookish) as his trusty assistant Terrence Howard (tough and loyal) as his military connection and Jeff Bridges (bald and menacing) as a mentor-turned-villain - lend a touch of class. But cruising above it all is Downey. Since Iron Mans helmet has no nose and a little rectangular mouth the smartest thing Favreau did was cast a lead whos constantly alive. The few times the red-and-yellow battle gear is front and center in ""Transformers""-ish action moments Favreau often shows his stars face inside the shell-head. As Downey pumps life into every scene its clear the actor long regarded as one of the best of his generation has not let the rust set in after his battle with drugs a decade ago. Even in the midst of those personal troubles Downey heated up every movie he was in. Now that he has been entrusted with a superhero franchise you may believe the man can actually fly. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The first superhero in a summer rife with them does not have innate superpowers. The actor playing him does. Tony Stark high-flying scion of weapons contractor Stark Industries becomes Iron Man out of necessity. As for Robert Downey Jr. Well who understands where the dark-eyed swift-gabbing actors gifts come from exactly? But his turn as the industrialist who has a change of heart -- literally and figuratively -- is a pleasure to behold. Downey owns all of cinemas dimensions. He delivers lines written by a cadre of screenwriters with grace and muscularity. Hes masterful with the rhythms of joke and tease. (Hes Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant balled into one fast-talking wisecracking package.) He makes listening a sensual pleasure. Sitting and tippling in a Humvee in Afghanistan he chats up three Stark-struck soldiers. After all Stark Industry is the militarys go-to contractor. A soldier asks to take a picture with Stark. Hes game then quips ""No gang signs."" Its a minor yet pitch perfect toss-off line. Downey moves with an uncanny awareness of the camera (proving why he was cast as Charlie Chaplin in Richard Attenboroughs 1992 bio- pic). Stark isnt ripped. Downey allows him a little sway in his back that pushes his belly forward. Directed with joyful verve and a nice pinch of cultural nerve by Jon Favreau ""Iron Man"" reinvigorates hope in the joys of the summer movie. It is simple -- and not so simple -- fun. The iron-clad casting of Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane fatherly surrogate corporate partner and Judas; Gywneth Paltrow as girl Friday Pepper Pots; and Terrence Howard as Col. Rhodes builds an even sturdier entertainment. (Comic fans familiar with Rhodes own foray into superhero-dom be warned ""Rhodey"" -- and Howard -- doesnt come into his own here.) Dreamed up by Stan Lee Larry Lieber Don Heck and Jack Kirby back in the early 60s for Marvel Comics Tony Stark and his iron-encased alter ego operated in a Cold War world. Stark operates in a world very much like our own. That game banter in the Humvee? It ends badly. Death happens. Stark is kidnapped. In a cave in the Afghanistan mountains dire need meets engineering ingenuity. (Later on corporate greed and Middle Eastern ideology will also do a counter tango.) Insurgent leader Raza (Faran Tahir) wants his own version of Stark Industries latest weapon of massive destruction. Shaun Toub is on hand to aid and interpret for Stark -- and no doubt to balance the depiction of Middle Easterners. Given the surveillance its a little hard to buy Starks uninterrupted inventing. Hes actually at work on a better pacemaker for his shrapnel- weakened ticker. But like any popcorn movie worth its seasoning salt the fleet story helps us shrug off the super(hero) improbable. He returns to the U.S. a changed man. Though his announcement that he wants to remake his company is about as well-received as Jerry Maguires mission statement. A great deal of fun comes just watching Stark at work in his sleek subterranean laboratory tweaking and spit-shining his red-and-gold Iron Man get-up. His fleet of high-horsepower cars stand neglected for the most part. ""Iron Man"" revels in the fantasies of a sexy even honorable geekdom where genius tinkerers get harangued then bedded then grilled yet again by foxy ""Vanity Fair"" reporters. They win at the craps table too. Its also a realm in which sociopolitical epiphanies lead to grand blueprints and swift execution of machines of peace -- and prosperity. ""Iron Man"" is superhero escapism for what ails a superpower.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 2 2008 Save for later Saved You know the superhero genre has come of age when Marvel Comics goes to Afghanistan. In ""Iron Man"" the first film fully financed by the mammoth entertainment company the titular hero played by Robert Downey Jr. gets to mix it up with bad guys who although they are not identified as such could easily be Taliban. (If only he had made it to Iraq.)Before he becomes Iron Man - that is before he comes to resemble the Michelin Man in red- and gold-plated armor - our hero is the none-too-heroic Tony Stark supergenius inventor jillionaire scamp and CEO of Americas biggest weapons dealership. (The character was patterned on Howard Hughes when he made his comic-book debut in 1963.)Early in the film Tony visits Afghanistan to show off his latest attack missiles and is kidnapped by enemy rebels wanting him to build them their very own weapon. Instead he constructs an armored suit complete with grenade and rocket launchers and makes his escape back to America and the Malibu aerie that doubles as his crash pad and high-tech laboratory. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Tony replaces his shrapnel-injured ticker with a glowing thingamajig of his own invention and the change of heart is both literal and metaphorical. Seeing up close the havoc wreaked by his armaments he renounces war profiteering much to the chagrin of his business partner Jeff Bridgess Obadiah Stane. (I love these comic-book names) An incipient good guy Tony devotes all his time to perfecting his armored outfit complete with boot jets that allow him to soar. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? An iron-clad hero lands with a thud Much has been made by Marvel of the fact that Iron Man unlike say the X-Men or the Fantastic Four is entirely human. But when Tony is zooming into the stratosphere raining destruction on bad guys hes about as ""human"" as a Jedi knight. Or at least he would be if he were played by anyone but Downey. Its unusual for a great actor to be cast in the lead role in a comic-book movie. In these situations sometimes OK actors are better than great actors anyway - Tobey Maguire makes more sense for example as Spider-Man than say Ryan Gosling.But Downey comes equipped with such a load of dark introspection and cunning that you cant imagine anyone else in the role once youve seen him. His trademark intonation - a kind of hasty ominous patter - makes perfect sense for a man whose thoughts run ahead of his mouth. Downey gives his reformed ""merchant of death"" a poignancy that goes a long way toward humanizing what might otherwise have been a ""Terminator""-style flick.With the exception of Bridges who makes his bald-pated Obadiah a fitting adversary the rest of the cast - which includes Terrence Howard as a Pentagon official and Gwyneth Paltrow as Tonys lovelorn assistant - is fairly perfunctory. Director Jon Favreau doesnt go for an obvious comic-book look but he also doesnt go in for much of anything else. When Iron Man is zooming above bejewelled southern California I expected a thundering lyricism but instead settled for some routine CGI stunts. I suppose its asking too much for a great actor to be matched up with a great director on a project like this. On the other hand theres always the sequel.

"Flash in the can - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie review Flash in the can As the playboy-turned-heavy-metal superhero Robert Downey Jr. brings Iron Man to life Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / May 1 2008 As you might expect ""Iron Man"" is an elemental affair. The ear for dialogue is tin. The directing contains lead. The gases released are mostly sulfuric (although a few of them turn out to be noble). And it all mixes to form that complex compound whose formula we know by heart the superhero blockbuster. I liked ""Iron Man"" but the I-know-it-by-heart part makes it somewhat resistible. Its entertainment out of a jar.Even though the movie makes an admirable bid for political topicality by retrofitting the struggles of its Marvel Comics hero for our current wars and even though the fantastic Robert Downey Jr. plays our slutty metallic superhero theres a sameness to it that makes the entire enterprise seem obligatory. Close your eyes and its ""Superman Begins Rise of the Silver Daredevil 3."" Even the hard rock of the films score sounds like heavy Muzak.Downey is Tony Stark a billionaire playboy brilliant scientist and extremely successful weapons manufacturer who lives in a sleek modernist fortress on a seaside cliff. On a trip to introduce a new slate of weapons in Afghanistan Tony is kidnapped and locked for three months in a cave by terrorists who demand that he replicate one of his designs. Instead with his helper Yinsen (Shaun Toub) he builds a giant iron suit and throws the insurgents around.Tony returns to America appalled at the reach of his military-industrial success and decides to stop selling weapons. How he could not have known he was doing such a bang-up job as a warmonger is a mystery. But his about-face might have something to do with the glowing electromagnetic amulet in his chest keeping his heart clear of shrapnel left by a bomb his kidnappers set to trap him. Tonys a big softie now ready even to consider real love with his assistant ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Meanwhile shares in Stark Industries plummet and Tonys stupendously bald partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) pushes him aside to restore profitability.What we have in parts of ""Iron Man"" is a nifty critique of corporate amorality with remorseful Tony bound to square off against heartless Obadiah. Indeed the films supervillain is a double-dealing big-business titan. But the most interesting action sequence requires Iron Man to save an Afghan village from the terrorists who threaten to tear families apart. Its cheesy and absurd (Iron Man has a lot of RoboCop in him). Its also effective. The international humanitarianism acknowledges that the sky sometimes falls in places other than New York.So kudos to the actor-director Jon Favreau and his four credited screenwriters for trying to raise the blockbuster consciousness although most of the good and excellent superhero films have politics or allegory on their minds (even that last execrable ""Fantastic Four"" movie gave us a waterboarding sequence). ""Iron Man"" isnt remotely as adventurous as the Marvel series which debuted in 1968 and which has had Tony Stark wrestle with alcoholism Communism Vietnam and destructive misappropriations of the Iron Man armor - a few years ago going so far as to accept a secretary of defense appointment to do so. Favreau and his team know they have to entertain us too. But rather than craft a sci-fi action-drama out of geopolitics they spray the movie with Teflon and complete a checklist Cool toys? Here. Expensive effects? Check. Damsel with a twist of distress? Yup. Climactic nighttime brawl straight out of ""Superman II"" (but badly staged)? Got it. Incoherent plot? You bet. Some activity for Terrence Howard who plays Jim Rhodes Tonys Air Force-commander best friend besides talking to Tony on phones? OK they missed one.Favreau is actually best in ""Swingers"" mode when say the camera pulls back from Downey and Howard and reveals that what we think is a nightclub party is actually a strip joint on Starks private jet. You half-expect Vince Vaughn to erupt from the cockpit.Otherwise Howard Paltrow and Bridges are in purely functional positions. Its odd seeing Paltrow gloss her way through what is basically an ingenue part - the sort of role that has enough to it to warrant a smart actor but not enough to keep you from noticing that Paltrow can do anything convincingly except stand around and be helpless. I swear I saw her check her watch once. Bridges undercooks his part as if hes warming up to the idea of embodying evil. His bald head is consistently arresting. I wanted to crack it open and make an omelet.But the movie is ultimately distinguished by its star. Either through uncertainty or misdirection actors who play superheroes tend to let the technical departments steal the show. Out of their suits the Christian Bales of the world still seem masked. Downey appears to like all this make-believe. Even the clunky dialogue sounds witty out of his mouth. This is not a part that makes great demands on his talent and his slummy approach to it is amusing.Downey could have taken a tragic tack. But he has fun just figuring out how to make the armor suit work. His sarcasm and almost drunken Tony Curtis body language transform the scenes of Iron Man flame-throwing or flying around You believe its Downey in there. And in case you dont the cinematographer Matthew Libatique gives us Martin Schoeller-like images of the actors face and eyes aglow beneath equipment and graphics. For such a standard clumsy picture the beauty in those shots is ludicrous. You expect to see a bunch of circuitry and you get a flash of soul.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

By Dana Stevens Also in Slate Grady Hendrix explains why Iron Man is like Steve Jobs. To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Iron Man click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man Iron Man (Paramount Pictures) may be the first movie about the conflict in the Middle East and Afghanistan to become a box-office blockbuster. But if it does it wont be because of its Afghan bad guys or somewhat incoherent musings on the immorality of the military-industrial complex. Iron Mans secret weapon dwells underneath the high-tech robot suit and the whiz-bang special effects We can win the war on terror the movie suggests with the force of Robert Downey Jr.s personality alone. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Downey plays Tony Stark--a billionaire playboy industrialist who turns himself into a superhero through pure technical ingenuity--as the Oscar Wilde of superheros a dissipated roue who seems weary of his own charisma. Everything we know about the actors own checkered back story--the countless drug relapses the stints in jail and rehab the mysterious ability to hold onto Hollywoods good will through it all--informs our first encounter with Tony clutching a Scotch on the rocks in the back of an armored Humvee as hes shuttled to a weapons demonstration in Afghanistan. After showing off his latest ultrasophisticated missile the Jericho at a U.S. Army base hes kidnapped by an insurgent group who torture him till he agrees to build them a Jericho of their own. Of course equipping your genius prisoner with the means to build a superweapon is a plan with a built-in flaw. Instead Tony forges a primitive prototype of the Iron Man suit and blasts his way to freedom. Advertisement Back at his zillion-dollar compound in Malibu Tony holds a surprise press conference to announce that Stark Industries will henceforth cease all weapons manufacturing and devote itself to vaguely defined technological do-gooding. Tonys newfound morality doesnt sit too well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who has been secretly dealing arms to some dubious types including Tonys kidnapper Raza (Faran Tahir). Unaware of Stanes treachery Tony withdraws to his way-cool underground workshop and begins to design the ultimate supersuit crafted not of iron this time but of gold and red-plated titanium. This middle section in which the newly energized Tony tinkers with his emerging superpowers like a kid in shop class is the movies finest and funnest hour. But when he starts to actually use those powers zooming to random corners of Afghanistan to save cowering villagers from evil warlords the movies sharp intelligence gives way to a dopey wish-fulfillment fantasy. This is what wed like our wars to be a clearly defined moral crusade against a bald glowering meanie who proclaims his Genghis Khan-like ambition to ""dominate all of Asia."" (With an eye on potential box-office buzz kill the movie cannily stays away from the mere mention of the Taliban the war in Iraq or domestic terrorism.) Tonys invulnerable omnipotent impossibly expensive armor is an almost touching overcompensation for the moment of extreme vulnerability in which our country finds itself. The movies central conflict which is also Starks internal one has to do with the ambiguity inherent in waging war. Once hes devoted his life to the creation of ever-more-sophisticated killing machines hows a billionaire industrialist-turned-superhero to know whos on whose side whom to arm and whom to disarm whom to kill and whom to save? Like those 50s monster movies that played out cultural fears of the atomic bomb Iron Man explores these questions and disavows them at the same time. In one scene the Iron Man confronts a group of Afghan villagers unable to distinguish the civilians from the combatants. At once a Terminator-style readout appears on the inside of his mask clearly labeling each civilian and with surgical precision he takes out all the bad guys leaving the grateful good guys standing. Its a clever and viscerally satisfying gag that got a round of applause at the screening I attended--but it left me with a bitter aftertaste that lasted for the rest of the movie. How much collateral damage have we inflicted by trusting just such ""smart"" weapons to make moral decisions for their users? Iron Man doesnt want you to dwell on such things for too long and Jon Favreaus crisp bouncy direction makes it easy to avoid doing so. Besides Downeys soulful mercurial performance theres Gwyneth Paltrow as his faithful girl Friday Pepper Potts--not the most inspiring of feminist role models but Paltrow plays it straight and smart and looks sensational in red hair and little black dresses. Jeff Bridges is weirdly but perfectly cast as Obadiah Stane Laconic and affable to the end hes The Dude gone over to the dark side. Terrence Howard gets a dull Dudley Do-Right part as Tonys Army liaison but one scene makes it clear that hes looking forward to suiting up in future installments. Like Tony Stark Iron Man the movie has a maddening way of hiding its light (Downey) under a bushel--actually bushels and bushels--of special effects. During the action sequences (especially the disappointing final one a face-off between Starks Iron Man and Stanes Iron Monger) this movie could be any expensive summer blockbuster with exploding tanks and bisected city buses and faceless mega-robots duking it out on rooftops. But when its idling in neutral and were watching Stark putter in his workshop or seduce unsuspecting journalists Iron Man abounds in that rarest of superpowers charm.

Photo Photo Credit Industrial Light amp; Industrial Light amp; Magic / (c) 200 Iron Man 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Im just not the hero type confesses Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) a zillionaire party-boy who assumes the clanking guise of Iron Man. Stark a weapons maker is a blithe and unconflicted player in the military-industrial complex who defines ``peace as ``havin a bigger stick than the other guy. He demonstrates this belief by launching his latest big stick a super-missile that spawns baby missiles in flight into a broad ridge of Afghan mountains blowing them all to hell. The American military brass are impressed. Then cue the irony Tony gets attacked with his own munitions by a band of rebel fighters who give him a fresh new perspective on the war machine. Anyone familiar with Iron Man mythology knows that the wounded Tony held captive and told to produce weaponry for the bad guys instead joins with the physicist Yinsen (Shaun Toub) to assemble an entire metal suit outfitted with jet-powered boots and other fabulous accessories. He shoulders the mantle of superheroism not through mutant genes or extraterrestrial body chemistry but through his own swinging innovative genius. Necessity is the mother of invention. Was an Iron Man movie strictly necessary? Did Jon Favreau have to invent it? Probably not. There are plenty of other flawed-avenger movies in circulation or soon to be (next up The Dark Knight) and audiences might have had their fill of large-scale robotic combat in last summers Transformers. But Iron Man is a special case because Tony Stark doesnt need the suit to make him cool - he already is with his downtown facial hair and babe-magnet charm. In this cheerful cinematic imagining hes neither Clark Kent-nerdy nor Bruce Wayne-reclusive. Hes just wicked rich and wicked smart. Granted hes bummed about his weapons falling into the wrong hands. Having escaped his captors in his newfangled super-powered armor Tony heads home and announces to the press that hes given up arms manufacturing for good. This piques the ire of his business partner the magnificently bald Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges uncorking gale-force personality swings) and worries his devoted assistant the long-suffering Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). They probably love each other but you know how that goes. Tonys Iron Man suit morphs through various permutations that more or less echo its (and his) evolution in the original Marvel series in which he changed over time from an uncomplicated Gable-esque bachelor to an irresponsible teetering alcoholic. In 1963 Afghanistan was Viet Nam; Stark was anti-Commie; his cutting-edge military technology involved ``midget transistors that freakily presaged the microchip. In the urtext Tony had to recharge his chest piece in a wall socket to keep his heart beating. These days he employs a ``miniaturized arc reactor a round bluish gizmo wedged into his sternum that glows like a small rose window in a church at sunset - a curiously spiritual effect. Otherwise Downey sashays through Iron Man with his chesty swaybacked gait giving Tony Stark the odd and not-unappealing look of a dissolute nightclub proprietor. The multiply authored screenplay too often devolves into cliches (He ``Just do it She ``Youll die He ``Push it) but Downey teases out the comedy wherever it lies giving this straight-up comic-book flick a dose of tweaked detachment Irony Man. After 2003s Elf and 2005s Zathura Favreau has now made three smart family-friendly high-concept popcorn movies. This is a good niche for him; he brings a gee-whillikers love of genre storytelling and a solid grip on character. This first Iron Man film (from that revelation at the end Im betting its not the last) is a simple start-to-finish origin story in which Tony gets wounded Tony builds suit Tony takes suit on nocturnal test flights set to generic musclehead-guitar riffs. But its fun to watch him whoosh through the sky and fun to watch him crash - this smartypants inventor with the super-powered get-up.

Hes Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) zillionaire industrialist and he arrives accompanied by the POW BANG and KA-BOOM suitable for a movie based on a comic book but with lots more intelligence than the genre usually demands. Its Iron Man to the rescue yanking movies and the worldwide box office out of its months-long doldrums and into the stratosphere. Starting tonight with saturation screenings Iron Man kicks off the blockbuster movie season right on time -- seven weeks before the summer solstice. But the Hollywood moguls cant afford to wait for June 21. Summer is the season designed to remind the still-vast film audience why they pay to see movies. And for the past few years summer means now. In 2007 three of the four top-grossing films (Spider-Man 3 Shrek the Third and Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End) all came out in May. (The fourth Transformers was released in the flop-proof July 4 week.) This year on consecutive May weekends the plexes should be clogged with customers to see Iron Man -- the first movie financed by the comics-based Marvel Enterprises -- followed by the Wachowski brothers Speed Racer and the latest installments in the Narnia and Indiana Jones franchises. Super-heroes fast cars and a lion who might be Jesus star power supreme just when the industry needs it. So say goodbye to the less exalted characters of the cinemas winter and early spring the Asian-American dopers and slacker documentarians the weepie men and baby mamas the caveman hunters and Boleyn sisters the chronically unmarried or uncomfortably pregnant or serial-killer imperiled women -- youll hardly be seeing any women at all in star roles. Even Judd Apatow and his goofball satyrs are taking a break. (The reigning producer of R-rated comedy has two movies opening toward the shank of the summer.) Fallible ordinarily engaging human-size earthbound characters just dont measure up when the weather turns warmer. We need another hero and lots of em the bigger stronger and cartoonier the better. At the beginning of Iron Man -- directed by Jon Favreau from a script by Mark Fergus Hawk Ostby Art Marcum and Matt Holloway -- Tony Stark is nearly a cartoon villain though hes drawn in the bold confident strokes worthy of a 60s Marvel Comic cover by Jack Kirby. He has a Mephistophelean goatee and a glint in his eyes that suggests this former boy wonder is a genius at wasting his genius. Hes a devoted practitioner of pride lust and avarice to name the fanciest of your deadly sins. This is a man who has got it all wealth power glamour notoriety and more women than he can shake his stick at. At the very moment hes supposed to be receiving an award at a Las Vegas convention hes actually at the craps tables surrounded by his favorite pets big money and fast women -- both endlessly duplicable both instantly disposable. Its all booty to him. Tony is an arms dealer an occupation that has fascinated playwrights for ages (George Bernard Shaw in Man and Superman Arthur Miller in All My Sons) and accounts for some of the evil-genius rep of Halliburtons gift to governance Dick Cheney. In his first appearance in the March 1963 issue of Tales of Suspense as written by Stan Lee and his brother Larry Lieber and illustrated by Kirby and Don Heck Stark was inspired by Howard Hughes in his Spruce Goose phase titan of industry crackerjack engineer-inventor indefatigable wooer of Hollywood actresses. (Later in the decade hed be transformed into a cool Cold Warrior fighting the Commies in Vietnam.) In the movie hes more a Richard Branson figure suave sexy driven a master of self-promotion and record-breaking stunts. What else could a rich man need?

Share Tweet Comic-book-to-film franchise starters often sag under the weight of creation stories establishing conflict between the super-heroic and super-villainous and introducing a roster of iconic characters familiar to comics geeks but unknown to the general movie-going public. Thats an awful lot of exposition for any one film to handle. Jon Favreaus Iron Man wrestles with those responsibilities as well as a relatively unique conundrum How do you make audiences care about a character whose face is hidden under a metallic scowl? The Iron Man filmmakers answer is to cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role and keep him out of the Iron Man suit for as long as possible. Downey stars as dashing billionaire playboy Tony Stark--part Howard Hughes part Errol Flynn--who leads a life unencumbered by reflection until hes captured and held hostage in Afghanistan by terrorists using his companys weapons. Downey escapes by building a crude version of his Iron Man suit. Upon returning home Downey perfects the robotic flying suit but when he announces that his company is getting out of the weapons business he makes himself an inviting target to rivals including enigmatic father figure Jeff Bridges who looks disconcertingly like Winter Kills co-star Sterling Hayden with his shaved head and mad-prophet beard. Iron Man takes its sweet time getting Downey into the Iron Man suit and it doles out big action setpieces sparingly once man has fused triumphantly with machine. Downey is so much fun as a breezy cad that its a shame he spends so much time brooding and luxuriating in obsession. Like Ang Lees Hulk Iron Man is a comic-book blockbuster characterized as much by heavyweight acting and sober intellectual concerns about the use and misuse of power and technology as the usual comic-book foolishness. But Iron Man finds a much more palatable audience-friendly balance between delirious spectacle and tortured introspection thanks largely to Downey a great actor whos also a great entertainer. His relationship with a fire-extinguishing robot is funnier and more poignant than the central relationship between humans in most movies and theres nothing arbitrary about love interest/long-suffering assistant Gwyneth Paltrow. Having gotten all that exposition out of the way in a brisk and entertaining fashion Favreau paves the way for more pure fun and excitement in future entries. Iron Man is the rare comic-book movie that makes the prospect of a sequel seem like a promise instead of a threat.

We first see him nursing a whiskey in the back of a military vehicle in Afghanistan where hes been demonstrating his latest breakthrough missile the Jericho to U.S. forces. Downeys Stark who sports a devilish Vandyke is a celebrity playboy and world-class cynic who comports himself like a rock star has a genius IQ and brushes off questions about the morality of selling weapons as if they were specs of lint on his tailor-made suits.  Not at first glance typical superhero material.Soon enough in director John Favreaus updating of the Marvel Comics tale Stark will have a mighty change of heart both physically and morally. Captured by a power-crazed Afghan warlord (in the comics origin tale created in the 60s he was abducted by communists in Vietnam) the badly wounded tycoon is held in a cave tortured and forced to create his missile for the warlord.  Instead he cobbles together the prototype of his Iron Man suit (how he does this without his captors noticing on their video surveillance screens is a plot point one doesnt want to ponder too closely) and bursts free. Back in his high-tech Malibu workshop his social conscience now raised hell turn out the definitive Iron Man suit which will enable him to go flying with superhuman speed around the globe battling evil in what Marvel and Paramount Pictures are hoping will be many future installments.Many people had a hard time imagining Downey donning superhero garb. In truth its hard to imagine ""Iron Man"" without him. For without his ironic hipster spin without his rapid off-speed line readings which can make the most ordinary exposition sound like tossed-off improvs this would be just another generic action picture with risible villains a conventional story arc and the inevitable showdown between two lumbering hunks of CGI metal--Iron Man vs. the even larger Iron Monger. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week In the casting of Downey and the selection of Favreau (the writer of ""Swingers"" and director of ""Elf"" and ""Zathura"") Marvel which now produces its own movies clearly aims to put a contemporary spin on this franchise. Up to a point they succeed Downeys presence gives the movie a refreshing edge and Favreau doesnt until the end cave in to the constant demand for special-effects fireworks. But then ""Iron Man"" is by its nature more down to earth than Marvels mutant-happy ""X-Men"" or ""Fantastic Four"" where just about everybody has superhuman powers theyre eager to demonstrate. Stark who has no innate superpowers is closer to the DC Comics wealthy Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman. His magic is all in the suit which functions as armor weapon and personal jet.  Theres a whiff of Batman too in the robotic lab assistant who speaks like Alfred the butler with distinctly British cadences. But Stark doesnt have Batmans weight; theres nothing gnawing at his soul except his newly discovered sense of justice.Favreau and his screenwriters (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby; Art Marcum and Matt Holloway) give the genre a new coat of paint but the reinventions dont go deep. Though they use Afghanistan as a backdrop they carefully avoid any political specifics--you wont hear the word Muslim uttered here--and the bad guys led by the nasty Raza (Faran Tahir) are generic power-hungry villains who could have been plucked out of a James Bond movie of any era. Theres a bigger villain lurking behind them (the one who becomes Iron Monger) but for the sake of all three people who wont instantly figure out who the treacherous one is I wont spoil the reveal.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Starks loyal efficient gal Friday Pepper Potts. Its a stock character but Paltrow and Downey give their scenes a playful sexual undercurrent that keeps things lively. Downey has always been the flirtiest of actors and Paltrow knows how to follow his lead. Jeff Bridges sporting a beard and shaved head lends heft to the role of Obadiah Stane Stark Industrys second in command whose capitalist heart is mortified when his boss turns over his new pacifist leaf. On the other hand Terrence Howards considerable talents are mostly wasted in the rather thankless role of Starks Air Force liaison.Favreaus imagery doesnt soar--""Iron Man"" has none of the sweeping lyricism that made Bryan Singers much maligned ""Superman"" a pleasure to watch--but hes paced the tale cleanly and well; it never feels overstuffed. Whether the movie has enough mayhem to satisfy 12-year-olds--and whether they respond to Downeys sly ironic spin--remains to be seen. Like it or not this summer season is piled high with rippling righteous superheroes. For those whose hearts dont race at this prospect ""Iron Man"" may not be distinguished enough to convert you to the cause. But Downey and Favreau give the movie a quirky flavor it can call its own. For that we can be grateful.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Directed by Jon Favreau. With Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Jeff Bridges. Now playing in New Jersey. THREE STARS The sun hangs high in the sky at evening the forsythia is in bloom and the last day of school is circled on the calendar in black magic marker. Yes summers nearly here. And theres no surer sign of that than ""Iron Man"" the first big film of the warm-weather season. Every summer brings at least one superhero -- most summers three or four -- and its easy to get jaded. Trippy surfers invisible girls Nicolas Cage with a flaming skull for a head... Yeah right whatever fine. But ""Iron Man"" is fresh and fast enough to remind you of why you liked comics to begin with -- or at least what made ""Spider-Man"" appealing enough to jump-start this cinema cycle six years ago. Like the webbed ones first adventure ""Iron Man"" is smart enough to remember its the suit that makes the superhero but the actor who makes the man. Rather than cast a hulking muscleman in the part it casts a real actor in the role. In fact a really good actor Robert Downey Jr. As a young man Downey was an extraordinarily talented performer -- his ""Chaplin"" remains a real achievement -- who was extraordinarily tortured as well. Even as hes brought his life out of drugs and back on track he carries the past with him and his dark eyes now have a haunted look. Iron Man -- Tony Stark in civilian life -- isnt a damaged soul on the level of Batman. But he is someone who has left behind an empty life to try to forge one of purpose. And thats something Downey knows. That isnt to say that Downey doesnt enjoy those early scenes where the playboy arms dealer luxuriates in fast cars and wild parties. Stark is one of the few Marvel heroes to actually have a busy sex life and in a summer without a Bond movie or ""Mission Impossible"" sequel its a kick to watch all that teen-boy wish fulfillment. But then Stark is attacked. Then betrayed. And its time to strap on the red-and-gold armor plating and kick those jet boots -- and the movie -- into gear. Director Jon Favreau who did a lot with less in ""Zathura"" handles the action scenes well and the CGI is good without any of the too-smooth-by-half movements that have marred other movies. The climax is sometimes too fast and quickly edited to be clear and doesnt take advantage of locations the way the ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" films have but the debut of the Iron Man suit is fun and there are several terrific fight-and-flight scenes. Terrific too is the cast which -- like Downey -- takes their parts on without either condescending scenery-chewing or apathetic dullness. Gwyneth Paltrow -- who really needs to shift some child care onto her husband and get back to making movies -- is a lovely if underused presence as Stars gal friday. And Jeff Bridges -- so committed that he even shaved off his Dude-ish locks for the role -- is fine as that usual Marvel villain the mentor-turned-monster. The script -- which bears the hands of two credited teams of screenwriters -- could have been sharper. It could also have tried a little less. We go to superhero movies to be brought out of the real world not reminded of it. (Stan Lees comics always had their measure of social commentary but the constant references here to Arab terrorists waterboarding and refugee camps root the movie too painfully in modern reality.) But none of that means this film isnt a titanium-plated success. And a great high-flying start to a summer whose E-ticket rides are about to start coming fast and furiously. Rating note The film contains violence and mild innuendo. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Yes that sounds like one of those overheated blurbs in a movie ad. But in this case its true - Downey is the movie. Sure there are plenty of top-dollar computer-generated special effects lots of cartoon violence; Jeff Bridges is really good; Gwyneth Paltrow is fine; Terrence Howard is OK but largely wasted. But the movie rises and falls on the strength of Downey and it rises pretty high. Director Jon Favreau has updated the tale of Tony Stark the rich playboy genius who develops a conscience starting the film with fighting in the Middle East. Thats fine but Iron Man doesnt really make any big political statements beyond the obvious - that greed gets in the way of good intentions. Instead it goes more for the moral development of Stark. When we meet him hes tooling down a road in Afghanistan with a military caravan having just demonstrated to the U.S. forces one of the weapons his company builds AC/DCs Back in Black blaring from a boom box. The man knows how to make an entrance. Drink in hand answering questions about how many Maxim cover girls he scored with last year he entrances the troops with tales of his exploits. The convoy is attacked and Stark critically wounded is captured by a group of bad guys who insist that he build a version of his latest weapon for them. A couple of things stand in his way Hes held in a cave and basically has the tools of a blacksmith in 17th-century Williamsburg Va. at his disposal and hes being kept alive by a car battery hooked up to his heart powering an electromagnet that keeps shrapnel from invading his ticker. To Stark those are minor setbacks. Instead of building the weapon he builds a metal suit escapes in a hail of lead and has a change of heart about the direction of his life (his heart now kept going by a little reactor he built). Upon returning home Stark who has seen his weapons fall into the wrong hands while in captivity can no longer abide it. Stark Industries will cease making munitions he announces to a startled press corps. Whoa buddy. Not so fast. Obadiah Stone (Bridges) who runs the company for Stark has other plans. Whatever. Stark has no time for business matters. Hes busy working on a new better version of the suit he built in the cave aided by his loyal social secretary/Gal Friday/possible love interest Pepper Potts (Paltrow). He tries to get buddy Jim Rhodes (Howard) interested in what hes doing but the military man wants no part of it. We see Stark build the suit. We see Stark test the suit. We see Stark tweak the suit. Which from the sound of it might make an excellent time for a bathroom and snack-bar break. But remember were actually watching Downey and hes fascinating. (The suit is pretty cool too.) Downey as Stark exudes a sort of roguish charm. Through flashbacks for instance we see Stark as the kind of guy who handles tough questions from a reporter by sleeping with her. Hes a hands-on guy in more ways than one. Some audiences might look for biographical bits and pieces from Downeys well-chronicled struggles with drugs weapons finding the right house to pass out in etc. Its unfair but its there unavoidable. To his credit Downey makes the most of it; theres a richness to both Stark the playboy and Stark the would-be hero thats informed by his real-life past. Or is it? Only Downey can know that for sure. Whatever the case it makes for a more interesting viewing experience than it would otherwise. Theres a lot of life lived there for both Downey and Stark and its right up on-screen. Stark must defeat both the Middle Eastern bad guys as well as a confidant who betrays him. (If you know the comic you know whom. If not it wont take long to figure out.) The ending is a hoot if an obvious setup for a string of sequels. Bring em on. Iron Mans story isnt as iconic as Supermans or Batmans but Downeys portrayal of him makes him a superhero worth dropping in on again.

I mean the ones like Batmans Bruce Wayne whose transformation from average Joe into masked crusader is an act of will instead of the unintended result of a genetic mutation a spider bite or a meteor ride to Earth from the outer reaches of the galaxy; the ones who underneath the metallic breastplates and layers of spandex remain ordinary bone and sinew.Zade Rosenthal(Click to enlarge)Iron giant Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Tony Stark the unlikely hero of the Iron Man comics co-created by Stan Lee Larry Lieber Don Heck and Jack Kirby is one such creation. A boy-genius inventor and heir to a weapons-manufacturing empire Stark initially conceives of his crime-fighting alter ego in an act of life-saving self-preservation donning a makeshift suit of rocket-powered armor in order to escape from the bad guys who have abducted him during a Stark Industries field-test. Nothing if not a product of his foreign-policy moment Stark first appeared in the March 1963 issue of Marvels Tales of Suspense just in time to fight the encroaching Red menace in Southeast Asia. In the 2008 film version of Iron Man directed by Jon Favreau Stark finds himself at odds with Afghan insurgents called the Ten Rings who in a wonderful Taliban-era irony come armed with a black-market supply of Starks own war machines. Plus ca change ...Where Lee and his collaborators based Stark in part on Howard Hughes the 21st-century version embodied here by Robert Downey Jr. is more like a defense-industry Mark Cuban or Richard Branson -- a coifed and tanned media-savvy technocrat whose too-cool-for-the-planet attitude says that as long as the market is up and were kicking Charlies (or Hadjis) ass it doesnt much matter how were doing it. But Stark soon gets his comeuppance in a desert-chic cave where -- his shrapnel-riddled heart kept a-ticking by a jerry-rigged electromagnet and a Ten Rings doyen demanding a custom-built smart bomb from Starks newly deployed ""freedom line"" -- he realizes that maybe WMDs arent so great after all. Not that Starks subsequent decision to dismantle the family business most profitable arm goes over very well with his board of directors or his longtime business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).Though Favreau remains best known for writing and co-starring in 1996s hipster totem Swingers he honed his directing chops with a couple of richly imaginative resolutely low-fi kids movies Elf and Zathura. If the larger-scale bigger-budget Iron Man never quite ascends to those heights of tinsel-and-string splendiferousness it maintains Favreaus fondness for the handmade over the prefab for Erector Sets over CRPGs. Its an exemplary comic book fantasia. Theres plenty of CGI to go around here too but Favreau uses it for the most part to enhance rather than supplant the movies physical dimension. Starks initial scrap-metal Iron Man exoskeleton in fact looks like nothing so much as the love child of L. Frank Baums Tin Man and Klaatu from The Day the Earth Stood Still and it moves with the staccato rhythms of the stop-motion-animated robots from the first Robocop film.Later when Stark returns to his sprawling Malibu mansion/laboratory -- a sort of sun-and-surf Batcave -- to perfect the prototype Favreau gives the scenes the slapstick ping of early Blake Edwards or Frank Tashlin. And Downey is -- as he is in most of the film -- a marvel to watch here his body a shimmying human Jell-O mold as he tries to get the hang of his newly jet-propelled hands and feet his face a kaleidoscope of exhilaration and terror. Hes like a kid without training wheels for the first time but also like a man newly resolved to make something meaningful out of his life. More than once in Iron Man you have the feeling the actor may have seen in Tony Stark a seriocomic surrogate of his own very public rehabilitation.The movie -- and I mean this as the highest possible compliment to Favreau and the four credited screenwriters (who include the Children of Men team of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby) -- takes the better part of an hour to really get going. Rather than cutting directly to the chase it takes its time to involve us in the characters who are relatively three-dimensional as comic book movies go and who are played by the kinds of actors who know how to make a lot out of not very much. As Starks dutiful waiting-to-be-unbuttoned girl Friday Pepper Potts Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly appealing while the ever-reliable Bridges manages to invest a glimmer of conflicted humanity in a role that all but comes with ""Villain"" stamped on its forehead. Even when the plot of Iron Man kowtows to convention the movies personality -- hip to the times without resorting to self-congratulatory snark -- keeps it zipping along. Rarer than a grown man in a rocket suit its a summer blockbuster that comes to entertain first and shill second.Just about a year ago at this time another summer tent pole that climaxed with giant robots body-slamming each other on the streets of Los Angeles was making its way into cinemas amid much clamor from critics that no matter what they wrote people would go see it anyway. The movie was called Transformers -- perhaps you have heard of it. Iron Man too is something people will see regardless of the reviews but here is the point Where Michael Bay has mastered a kind of sensory-assaulting pop art Favreau is a born storyteller who engages the audiences imaginations rather than crushing them in a tsunami of digital noise. He gives us giant robots we can actually care about as opposed to those we can scarcely tell apart -- and that I would propose is the difference between making images and making movies.IRON MAN | Directed by JON FAVREAU | Written by MARK FERGUS HAWK OSTBY ART MARCUM and MATT HOLLOWAY | Produced by AVI ARAD and KEVIN FEIGE | Released by Paramount Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Iron Man - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Iron Man Iron Man The Orphanage / Marvel Studios Summer movie season starts early as Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark|/|Iron Man in the Jon Favreau-directed superhero movie the first Marvel Studios production. Summer movie season starts early as Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark|/|Iron Man in the Jon Favreau-directed superhero movie the first Marvel Studios production. (The Orphanage / Marvel Studios) Kenneth TuranTimes Movie Critic IRON MAN? This is the name for a superhero? Rather than sounding like a six-pack of blue-collar beer shouldnt the handle for a fighter for truth and justice be something sleek and modern like Titanium Man or even Uranium Al? Isnt Iron Man a little old-school for todays computer-generated movie franchise world?Dont tell that to the folks at Marvel whose characters have made a fortune at the box office -- 4.9-billion worldwide gross to date thank you very much -- starring comic book heroes who were in their prime 40-plus years ago before much of todays core audience was even alive. Much as we might like to avoid the fact the comic book movie is clearly the genre of our time. So here comes ""Iron Man"" following gamely in the footsteps of ""Spider-Man"" ""X-Men"" ""Fantastic Four"" ""Hulk"" ""Daredevil"" and the other Marvel heroes. Directed by Jon Favreau its got an energetic engaging performance by Robert Downey Jr. in the starring role and such an elaborate series of Iron Man suits for him to wear that it takes 10 pages in the production notes to fully describe them.But though ""Iron Man"" is diverting enough in the comic-book-movie mode there is one thing it doesnt have and that is dramatic unity. Unlike the irreducible element that is its namesake ""Iron Man"" the movie is an alloy a combination of several different and disconnected components that dont manage to unite to make a coherent whole. Though this feeling is inescapable throughout the film a key part of the reason isnt clear until the final credits reveal that two different teams of writers (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway) worked on the film. And not just worked on it in any conventional way. As an article in Script magazine details they happily toiled without meeting on separate-but-equal versions of the script that were eventually merged by Marvel and the director.In theory this ""one from column A one from column B"" approach might have worked but in this case it does not. Though many of the films sequences are fine in and of themselves when joined together they tend to seem not of a piece unable to provide the single sweeping narrative we crave. Favreau who has worked in different genres with mixed success (yes to ""Elf"" no to ""Zathura"") may not have noticed and frankly audiences likely will not either but the situation remains.Diversity of tone hardly seems a problem when ""Iron Man"" opens with high-energy sequences that introduce Downey as billionaire inventor/playboy/merchant of death Tony Stark a second-generation weapon manufacturer who lives in a Malibu house the size of a small city and spends his free time womanizing gambling and accepting accolades for being a visionary genius and American patriot.With his weakness for glib one-liners and throwaway comments (""I need it buy it store it"" he says of a potential Jackson Pollock purchase) this part has been nicely tailored to Downeys talents and is a great deal of fun as a result. If Downey slips easily into cartoon mode his big-name costars have more mixed experiences. Jeff Bridges clearly relishes being Tonys full-bearded and bald partner Obadiah Stane while Gwyneth Paltrow runs hot and cold as Tonys loyal assistant Pepper Potts and the gifted Terrence Howard looks noticably uncomfortable as Tonys long-suffering pal Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes.Sadly the films fun-loving party animal Tony is not with us for very long.Traveling to Afghanistan (actually its nearby Lone Pine Calif.) to demonstrate a new weapon system Tony gets kidnapped by noticeably cranky jihadists who consider him ""the most famous mass-murderer in the history of America"" and want him to build them one of his ""masterpieces of death"" in the dank cave theyve imprisoned him in.Though his heart has been damaged by (how ironic) shrapnel from one of the bombs his company created Tony it turns out is not a man to mess with. Turning dour and serious he fools the jihadists who show themselves to be bears of very little brain and constructs his first Iron Man suit which makes him look like an especially fierce refrigerator-freezer.Once hes back in the U.S. of A. it turns out that time spent in the cave has turned our hero into yet another Tony this one a touchy-feely guy who believes he has ""more to offer the world than making things blow up.""He promptly retreats to his Malibu basement where he spends far too much of the movies time in the trial-and-error process of getting his new improved titanium-and-gold Iron Man suit to work.I understand that this film is an origin story but even so enough is enough.Yet more Tonys emerge in the rest of ""Iron Man"" from the Human Rights Watch monitor on steroids who protects innocents in Afghanistan to the superhero who fights a behemoth called Iron Monger in the films elaborate finale.With all these Tonys running around its not surprising that ""Iron Man"" feels more convoluted than it needs to be.Downeys unbeatable charisma makes these problems less troublesome than they would be otherwise but wouldnt it be nice if they didnt exist at all?kenneth.turanlatimes.com""Iron Man.""

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Spirit 1/2 (out of four)Stars Gabriel Macht Samuel L. Jackson Eva Mendes Scarlett Johansson Sarah Paulson Dan LauriaDirector Frank MillerDistributor LionsgateRating PG-13 for intense sequences of stylized violence and action some sexual content and brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesOpens Thursday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Comic book movies tend to be summer fare. While Iron Man and TheDark Knight were this years hot-weather highlights The Spirit in its dark artiness works well during this chillier season. Based on the comic books by Will Eisner and written and directed by Frank Miller it resembles Sin City which Miller co-directed and Millers comic series 300. With its dark palette and stylized look it also incorporates an evocative film noir style. Some performances are particularly fun such as Samuel L. Jacksons villainous Octopus and Eva Mendes seductive bad girl Sand Seref. And Gabriel Macht as the Spirit acquits himself with wit and dash. But others cant seem to make up their minds whether to play it straight or cartoonish particularly Scarlett Johansson who is rather stiff as the Octopus assistant. The setting is a metropolis called Central City and the era is a melange of the contemporary (cellphones the Internet) the future (cloned evil henchmen) and the glamorous past (men wear hats women are dripping in jewels and everyone rides in cabs). The masked Spirit is the reconfigured body of murdered cop Denny Colt and he is as devoted to his city as Batman is to Gotham. He hunts down bad guys and protects the populace which regards him gratefully -- particularly the women. But keeping watch on the many tentacles of the psychotic Octopus is the Spirits chief concern. A former coroner the fiendish Octopus is out to control the city. But his bizarre likes and dislikes are what most catch our attention. (""You know I dont like egg on my face"" he hollers. ""No egg on my face"") The script has other moments of offbeat humor yet the stylized production design with its moody look is perhaps the most striking aspect of the film. The Spirit is uneven but its campy adventure provides some amusing escapist fun. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Iron Man Successful superhero flick | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesIron Man Successful superhero flick Theres no rust on the first blockbuster of summer 08 Iron Man is an ironclad cinch to be a hit.Robert Downey Jr. stars in Iron Man.  (ZADE ROSENTHAL PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 1 2008 Starring Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. Directed by Jon Favreau. At major theatres. 126 minutes. PG Theres no rust on the first blockbuster of summer 08 Iron Man is an ironclad cinch to be a hit.Its everything you want from a superhero flick - lots of action great characters and a really cool suit - and it smartly vaults a lesser Marvel Comics hero into the same stratosphere as Spider-Man. But as spectacular as the hardware is in Iron Man and that includes the best robot sidekick since C-3PO its the human software that really drives this macho machinery. The casting represents a risk that paid off handsomely.Article Continued BelowIt took a superhuman leap of faith to hire Robert Downey Jr. for the title metal man (hes actually clad in gold titanium alloy) since there were no guarantees hed be either appropriate for the job - or even available.Entire forests have been levelled with tabloid accounts of Downeys substance-abuse problems rehab sessions and prison stays. The fact he still has a movie career is no small marvel in itself.""Im just not the hero type clearly"" Downey says in his alter ego of billionaire arms builder Tony Stark in one of many winks to the stars notoriety in the films amusing script. Actor/director Jon Favreau (Elf) provides the ace helming.Downey turns a negative into a spectacular positive and its entirely in tune with the bad-boy nature of Stark whom we meet as hes swilling scotch cranking AC/DC on the stereo and selling a new mountain-levelling missile called Jericho to the U.S. army in Afghanistan.Its not that Stark is against peace but he believes that ""peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.""A roadside ambush by vaguely defined terrorists led by a bald thug (Faran Tahir) who looks like Vin Diesels meaner brother forces Stark into a unique dilemma the other guy wants ""a bigger stick"" too. Stark is forced to begin building a Jericho missile inside the mountain lair of the terrorists.This being a comic book story true to Iron Man lore Stark has been fitted with a chest device that both keeps him alive and prevents shrapnel from entering his heart.As smart as he is brash Stark conjures an escape plan that unveils the first of three Iron Man outfits which over the course of the movie evolve into the definitive superhero fashion statement. Starks worldview also evolves as he returns stateside and declares that henceforth Stark Industries will no longer build weapons much to the chagrin of his business partner Obadiah Stane played by a bald and bearded Jeff Bridges. Stane delivers a ""might is right"" riposte that fuels the movies ""war on terror"" backbeat ""What we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.""Stark is not to be deterred from his new do-gooder stance but his evolution is not without its literal ups and downs. Indeed Stark seems like an oversexed and over-refreshed version of Wile E. Coyote constantly crashing his various inventions yet hilariously bouncing back each time. More serious challenges are to come.Hes assisted by his robot butler Jarvis who deserves above the line billing and by his loyal human assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is Iron Mans other divine casting choice. The brittle Ms. Paltrow has made a career out of dodging roles like this going so far as to lampoon them in an Austin Powers sequel. But she likewise uses her real personality and notoriety to make a character who is far more interesting than women are generally allowed to be in the supergeek universe.In the case of Bridges another fine hire its felicitous against-type casting. The man best known as the mellow slacker ""The Dude"" from The Big Lebowski gets to play a stogie-chewing warmonger who would be right at home in Dick Cheneys dungeon.Not so fortunate is Terrence Howard who is barely there as Rhodey Starks military buddy and nattering nanny. But he gets to deliver one of the movies best lines while at the same time dropping a hint that hes got his own super future in the Iron Man franchise.And make no mistake; this is the birth of a new franchise. The only thing wrong with Iron Man - and I cant believe Im saying this - is that its too short even at 126 minutes. It ends just as the action is really picking up.

For kicks. The bucks arent bad either.Sporting wit (and goatee) sharp as a survival knife Robert Downey Jr. is the billionaire bon vivant in Iron Man the fast funny and deliriously entertaining flick based on Marvel Comics self-made superhero. Unlike genetic and environmental supers this weapons whiz gives himself superpowers. A hard-drinking inventor/playboy/businessman Tony is a hybrid of Howard Hughes and Hugh Hefner 1950s fantasy figures gene-spliced for 2008. Tony sells bombshells to the Pentagon and procures them from the pages of Maxim. He lives in a Malibu villa with a panoramic view of the Pacific. His garage is stocked with hot cars his bed with hotter women. On his private jet are flight attendants who do double duty as mile-high pole-dancers. It would appear that there are no limits to the lifestyle of this smart-aleck designer of smart weapons. Yet while demonstrating his companys newest missile the Jericho to U.S. forces in Afghanistan Tony is ambushed by insurgents. To his horror they hoard Stark Industries products and want him to build a Jericho to deploy against U.S. forces. When Tony sees American soldiers killed by the weapons he designed to defend them weapons that have left him with a heart full of shrapnel he has a crisis of conscience. With little more than a pile of scrap metal and a welding torch Tony hammers out a masterwork of precision weaponry an armored suit that enables him to elude captors and reinvent himself as a person concerned about the consequences of his weapons. By a remarkably similar process in Iron Man director Jon Favreau takes the scrap metal of the superhero scenario and welds it into new form reinventing the oversimplified good-versus-evil genre to reflect on more-nuanced consequences of war. Favreau the off-center actor and director of Elf Made and Zathura is not the first guy youd think of for this assignment. And thank goodness. Like Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow Favreaus casting of the sardonic Downey as Tony Stark is a risk that pays off. Downey is a gifted actor who suggests two moods at once flippantly tossing off serious commentary embedding the debate about war into his character. Though neutral about current events in Afghanistan and Iraq the film is militantly anti-war profiteer. Favreau elicits more emotional tonalities from his actors than ordinarily found in a film based on a comic book. Aside from Downey the film boasts Jeff Bridges as Tonys charismatic and cagy business partner Obadiah; Gwyneth Paltrow as Tonys smoothly sarcastic assistant Pepper; and Shaun Toub as Yinsen an Afghan doctor whose surgical skills and gallows humor save Tonys life. As great as Downey is and as entertaining as the other performances are what makes the film is Tonys joy of making. Whether Tony is in an Afghan cave his ailing heart hooked up to an electromagnet and a car battery while improvising his first armored suit or in his basement designing and test-driving Iron Mans gold-and-titanium upgrade the film delights in the mechanics of invention which is infectious. Its a machine dream and a happy relief from the typical blockbusters reliance on digital effects. (One of Tonys inventions a surveillance device that identifies civilians and targets terrorists would be extremely useful.) Until a final conflict that more resembles a monster-truck jam than a superhero showdown Iron Man is solid gold.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Iron Man stays true to its roots | StAugustine.com Toggle navigation Home News News Local Business Crime Sports Weather Subscribe Obits Classifieds Classifieds Local Jobs Homes Search Iron Man stays true to its roots FRANK LOVECELos Angeles Times-Washington Post Published Friday May 02 2008 Youll believe a multinational billionaire industrialist can fly. More importantly youll believe his psychological transformation from hedonistic jingoist to repentant humanitarian albeit one with a heavily armored fighter-jet suit. Its that fidelity to emotional truth that makes the Marvel superhero saga ""Iron Man"" the best comic-book adaptation in years. With pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science director Jon Favreaus action-drama remains faithful to the source material while updating it -- and recognizing whats made that material so enduring isnt just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit but the human condition that got him there. As in the comics defense contractor/playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is caught in a battlefield explosion while conducting weapons business. Here hes captured by a Middle Eastern warlord (Faran Tahir). Stark is ordered to create a super weapon before the shrapnel working its way toward his heart kills him. With a fellow captured scientist (Shaun Toub) Stark instead creates a chest-mounted device to stabilize the shrapnel and a metal suit with which he routs his captors. Stark in the comics used his ever-upgraded armor to fight alien threats and supervillains remaining an arms manufacturer. The movie instead tells a story of personal redemption Stark announces that his company will cease making weapons. This incenses his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and worries his major-domo the workaholic ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Starks best friend and government liaison Air Force Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) simply sees this as temporary dilettantism. By the time each separately discovers the suit Starks been building in his Malibu mansion personal and corporate concerns are about to reach smelting point. Despite several adrenaline-pumping moments Favreau and Downey stay focused on the real story -- about a man learning to take responsibility for his actions. For all its firepower and CGI slickness thats what really makes ""Iron Man"" fly. ""Iron Man"" is rated PG-13.

Its a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune May 2 2008 -- 119pm Photo Credit Zade Rosenthal Zade Rosenthal Iron Man Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The diabolical goatee gives it away. Tony Stark the tycoon inside Iron Mans shiny shell isnt a simplistic comic book hero fighting for lofty ideals. Hes deeply flawed -- a drinker a womanizer a clotheshorse a gambler driven by greed and a lust for high living. In fact hes essentially heartless depending on a nuclear pacemaker to keep his blood circulating. Hes a 21st-century Oskar Schindler a munitions maker who reinvents himself as a champion for good. ""Iron Man"" is as complex as its conflicted protagonist. Its a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor a well-acted adult take on juvenile escapism. The first movie self-financed by Marvel Studios it combines the thrills of a summer popcorn spectacular with the craftsmanship of a prestige picture. Stark is played by Robert Downey Jr. who comes across as tough wiry and smart. We meet him as a well-manicured hand holding a crystal tumbler of Scotch in an armored personnel carrier rumbling over dangerous territory in Afghanistan. A celebrity tycoon in the mold of Donald Trump (but much smarter) he brings a sense of style and showmanship to marketing weapons of mass destruction. He is no fan of deterrence a shock-and-awe kind of guy. ""I dont like the weapon you dont have to fire"" he tells a military audience. ""I like the weapon you have to fire only once. Thats how dad did it thats how America does it and its worked out pretty well so far."" Starks also a high-value target for bad guys who capture him in a hell-raising rocket attack take him prisoner and force him to build them a super weapon from a cache of captured munitions. Sweating over forges and circuit boards like a high-tech Vulcan the Roman god of fire destruction and craftsmanship Stark fashions a super-powered suit of armor decimates the terrorist camp and flies to safety. Well halfway to safety. The prototype crash-lands in the desert setting up an exhilarating running gag in which every new version of the rocket suit triggers bumpy forced landings. IRON MAN  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and brief suggestive content. Marvel superheroes tend to travel the same roads in different costumes. They are transformed by some extraordinary accident have some trouble adjusting to their new powers and face a nemesis in the form of a domineering father figure. Jeff Bridges gives that type an affable twist as the wonderfully named Obadiah Stane a Stark Industries board member who takes a dim view of the CEOs decision to retool the company toward peaceful green projects following his face-to-face encounter with the realities of combat. Bridges makes Stane the kind of charmer who throws a friendly arm around your shoulders while plotting the best way to break your neck. Superheroes also need adoring girlfriends and ""Iron Man"" has a keeper in the form of Virginia Potts Starks secretary and slowly thawing love interest played with self-assured humor by Gwyneth Paltrow. The film is stocked with excellent actors who make stock characters into memorable individuals. The final showdown with the fast agile Iron Man battling a bigger stronger version demolishes much of Southern California. The films ka-boom quotient is quite high although not on a par with the epic destruction of ""Transformers."" Yet few viewers will complain of feeling shortchanged. This is one summer blockbuster that succeeds on brains not bombast.

(The trend really started back in 1989 when Tim Burton turned a saucer-eyed noodge like Michael Keaton into Batman.) Yet its still bracing to see Robert Downey Jr. redefine what it takes to be a superhero in Iron Man. As Tony Stark a high-living celebrity weapons magnate who is wounded on a trek through Afghanistan only to transform himself into a hulking mechanical rocket man Downey doesnt dial down his eager narcissistic wit. Wearing a goatee right out of the beatnik 50s hes fast and frictionless as airlessly ironic as a talk-show host whos been shoved onto the air at 3 a.m. and left to his own what-the-hell devices. The key to Downeys mocking crumpled charm is that no matter whom hes talking to hes really just nattering to himself. When he climbs into his Iron Man machine suit with its whirring clicking limbs and plated chest flamethrower arms and mask of a medieval knight he doesnt disappear behind the tin-can walls of that chunky atomic-age jet-pack robot. Hes still there a deftly fragile motormouth -- a damaged soul who needs armor to fully become himself. Just about every classic comic-book superhero is at heart a Jekyll-and-Hyde divided between ineffectuality and power. Too often however the movies adapted from comic books come with their own split personalities. Theres the flat prosaic story with all that overbright franchise lighting and actors like Tobey Maguire doing their best to charm us in thinly scripted regular-guy roles. And then there are the special-effects parts when suddenly were asked to believe that a man can fly or shimmy up walls or dissolve into particles even as we remain naggingly aware that were watching a digital extravaganza that has little to do with mopey nice-guy acting. The fun of Iron Man a Marvel adaptation in which a routine arc has been burnished with great elegance and skill is the way that it heals the split soldering the two halves of its hero into a single organically driven figure. On that fateful Afghan jaunt Downeys Stark is wounded by one of his own bombs then kidnapped and taken to an insurgent lair where a magnetized gizmo is surgically implanted in his chest all to keep the bits of shrapnel from heading toward his heart. To fool his captors he pretends to construct the cluster bomb they demand but instead he builds himself a mechanical alter ego and flies to freedom. Back at his hillside mansion (one of many clever details -- its out of vintage Bond) Stark then erects a new improved version with a two-toned shell and computerized mask. His desire? To destroy the weapons that he once created. He becomes a rock-em sock-em robot for peace. The director Jon Favreau doesnt exactly have a big sci-fi track record -- he wrote and starred in Swingers and also directed Elf -- but he draws on his humanistic gifts to make Iron Man""] a compellingly down-to-earth superhero fantasy. The effects sequences in which Iron Man zips through the air like a toaster thats been shot out of a cannon are ingenious enough to never let us forget that this gold-titanium hulk has been built from the ground up. (When he takes off you feel the quivering smoky thrust of his engines.) The story line is to put it mildly familiar with all the episode-one bona fides ticking into place. Yet Favreaus direction never feels rote even during the sky-zipping metal-smashing action scenes and the casting is aces. Jeff Bridges as Starks corporate partner looks as scary as a cult leader in his shaved head and bushy beard but he underacts benignly; Bridges uses that wry trust-me voice to create a timely portrait of stylish power. And Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts Starks selfless girl Friday manages the neat trick of taking a character whos a prefeminist throwback and playing her with a liberated twinkle. When Pepper replaces Starks glowing electric heart device its a nifty squishy gross-out and a terrific love scene. Too often superhero films feel like a different species of entertainment from the smudged comic books that spawned them. Iron Man takes you back to the days when you sprawled out in front of those books flipping through the adventures of a dude who was too vital and vulnerable to ever be a mere F/X object. Even at his coolest Downeys Iron Man remains a ghostly neurotic crusader -- one whose life in the Marvel tradition has become a grand spectacle of overcompensation.

But theres just something more relatable about Tony Stark even though hes a playboy industrialist of staggering wealth and arrogance. Photos Sizzling Summer BlockbustersAnd in the hands of Robert Downey Jr. hes absolutely riveting. Downey may have seemed an unlikely casting choice at first but its difficult to imagine any other actor in the role; hes so quick-witted and he makes such inspired decisions with dialogue that at times might have seemed corny otherwise. Throughout his eclectic career - from ""Less Than Zero"" and ""Chaplin"" to ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" and ""Zodiac"" - hes always been capable of both great charisma and vulnerability and both are beautifully on display in this the biggest movie of his life. ""Iron Man"" is a blast too - the perfect start to the summer with its shiny mix of visual effects elaborate set pieces and plenty of humor within its intelligent script.This is also the biggest movie of director Jon Favreaus life following ""Made"" ""Elf"" and ""Zathura"" and he juggles all the complicated expensive toys deftly. The visual effects come courtesy of the venerable Industrial Light amp; Magic with Matthew Libatique (""Requiem for a Dream"" ""Inside Man"") providing the crisp cinematographyStuff gets blown up real good to the tune of AC/DCs ""Back in Black"" and appropriately Black Sabbaths ""Iron Man"" but beneath the requisite spectacle is an issue-laden storyline with heart to go along with its brains. Tonys weakened heart has always been his Achilles heel but its also what gets him out of trouble and inspires his rebirth.The first moments of ""Iron Man"" give us a telling glimpse of Tony a close-up of his hand cradling a tumbler of Scotch on the rocks as he rides in the back seat of a Humvee thats rumbling across the Afghanistan desert. Hes the brilliant and talented head of Stark Industries the leading supplier of weapons to the U.S. military and he banters comfortably with the soldiers who have been assigned to protect him during a trip to demonstrate his latest missile. They in turn are in awe of his high-flying ways.(The Iron Man comic-book character was partly inspired by billionaire industrialist Howard Hughes but the similarities to Downeys own life are unmistakable the well-documented highs and lows and now the shot at complete redemption. The subtext provides both knowing laughs and a sense of substance.)But things go awry almost immediately. The Humvee is attacked by insurgents and Tony is abducted. While in captivity with a battery attached to his heart to keep him alive hes ordered to reconstruct the missile. Instead with the help of the doctor who saved him (a graceful Shaun Toub) hes crafty enough to create a suit of armor and become a weapon himself to escape.Tony returns home to his monstrosity of a mansion thats carved into the face of a Malibu cliff but looks more like an old set from ""The Jetsons."" Hes a changed man and the changes he has welcomed to his life and company also bring enemies. His top executive Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges deliciously villainous with a shaved head and devilish goatee) is appalled at Tonys new purpose - to no longer make weapons. But Stane insists ""What we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.""Its an anti-war argument in the multilayered script from the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway but the delivery is hardly heavy-handed. The original ""Iron Man"" comic book that inspired the film took place in the 1960s during the Vietnam War and Tony Stark was relevant functioning as an important fervently anti-communist cog within the military-industrial complex. Moving the films action to Afghanistan and the present day makes it just as relevant in its own way.In his tricked-out underground workshop his own personal bat cave Tony creates his Iron Man uber-suit even though hes not quite sure what to do with it once hes finished the right thing perhaps for the first time in his life?His right-hand woman Pepper Potts stuck by him and kept his life organized when he was a shallow pig but seems to like the more enlightened Tony better. (In another unexpected bit of casting Gwyneth Paltrow brings understated smarts and class to the role.) Meanwhile his best friend Rhodey an Air Force colonel played by an underused Terrence Howard just seems confused by this person he no longer thinks he knows.Tony undergoes plenty of trials and errors on the road to becoming Iron Man which are both amusing and thrilling. But the moment he finally climbs inside that streamlined rocket-propelled red-and-gold suit - with its perfectly intertwined pieces that lock together like the most comfy high-tech pair of ski boots - will surely cause the hearts of geeks and non-geeks alike to go pitter-patter.But because the build up is so successfully engaging the ending feels like a letdown. Its just plain silly watching versatile Oscar-nominated actors behave like a couple of middle-aged Transformers.Thats merely one bump in an otherwise satisfying ride though. And theres plenty of opportunity for improvement The last line clearly sets up a sequel. But you knew that was ironclad from the beginning.""Iron Man"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and brief suggestive content.

"Iron Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; iron-man ) Iron Man (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Iron Man is a different breed of superhero movie - a film that remembers its possible to be outside the target demographic and still enjoy a tale set in this genre. What makes Iron Man interesting isnt the storyline which except for a few wrinkles is pretty much a standard issue superhero origin plot but the way in which filmmaker Jon Favreau presents the narrative. Iron Man is mature in its perspective and the way it views its lead character while at the same time tapping into the inner kid during some expertly executed action sequences. It uses CGI to advance the story rather than to populate the screen with pretty images. And perhaps most importantly the humor is restrained enough to avoid pushing the film over the line into camp or self-parody. Over the years there have been only a handful of exceptional superhero movies and Iron Man is among them. Iron Man opens in Afghanistan as a U.S. troop convoy carrying billionaire arms maker Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is attacked. Those charged with safeguarding Tony are killed; he is seriously wounded and taken captive. A round of flashbacks follows introducing us to the brilliant naA-ve playboy and those around him his devoted Girl Friday Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow); his take-no-prisoners business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges); and his best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). Tony is on his way to Afghanistan to show off Stark Industrys latest and greatest way of killing people and that gets us back to where we came in. When he awakens Tony is in a cave. As a result of his injuries there is irremovable shrapnel in his chest and he must wear an electromagnet attached to his torso to keep the fragments from reaching his heart. He and his doctor/assistant/translator Yinsen (Shaun Toub) have been given the charge of making a mighty killing missile for the guerilla leader Raza (Faran Tahir). Instead however Stark uses the available materials to fashion a bulletproof weaponed suit of armor that allows him to escape from the caves and return to friendlier locales. Once back home he makes some radical decisions. He decides to terminate the companys weapons division (which sends stocks tumbling and enrages the board of directors) and to concentrate on perfecting the design of the suit that enabled him to escape Afghanistan. Although Iron Man updates the comic books opening chapters (shifting the locale from Vietnam to Afghanistan for example) it remains faithful to the spirit if not all the particulars. For viewers unfamiliar with the source material theres no sense of being dropped unceremoniously into the middle of a fanboys dream flick. Favreau has crafted the production to maximize appeal for both to those steeped in Iron Man lore and those who have never previously heard of the Mighty Marvel Metal Man. This is much like what Chris Nolan accomplished with Batman Begins stripping away the legend and building it up gradually using narrative and character (not action and effects) for the foundation. There has never been a more inspired choice for a superhero than Robert Downey Jr. In recent decades weve seen the likes of Christopher Reeve Michael Keaton Val Kilmer George Clooney Patrick Stewart Hugh Jackman Tobey Maguire Ben Affleck Nicolas Cage Christian Bale and others don capes cowls and masks but none has accomplished this with more style wit and panache than Downey. His performance is riveting. He commands the screen. He nails Stark making him much more than a charismatic fusion of Bill Gates Hugh Hefner and Howard Hughes. In one sense Iron Man is really a character story with action elements focusing on Starks psychological journey from luxurious ignorance to shocked awareness and how having his eyes opened he can no longer stand by and do nothing. Downey sells this transformation while imbuing Stark with a biting sense of humor. While none of the supporting characters are given anything close to the three-dimensional treatment accorded to Tony there are some nice touches. The film does a solid job of misdirection when it comes to identifying the eventual chief villain; its nice to find a movie that doesnt strictly follow the bad guy manual all the way through. The interaction between Stark and Gwyneth Paltrows Miss Potts adds a little lightweight romance to things. Theres something between these two although it rarely manifests itself as anything more serious than a Bond/Moneypenny flirtation. The special effects are top-notch and never seem overused or gratuitous. There are more of them than may be obvious since theyre used not only in the several big action sequences but in some of the more sedate scenes (such as the played-for-laughs episode where Tony tries out the flying boots hes working on). Special effects are at their best when they work to enhance the plot without calling attention to themselves. Thats what occurs in Iron Man. The effects wizards are in synch with the director not trying to show off and upstage the actors. Comparisons can be made between Iron Man and Batman. Both franchises feature rich men who turn to crime fighting as a way to provide balance. Both have lots of gadgets at their disposal. And both have faithful retainers who offer help and advice (Alfred Miss Potts). Yet in terms of their cinematic incarnations even the latest Batman inhabits a pseudo-fantasy world. Tony Stark is grounded in something close to our reality. This gives Iron Man a sense of immediacy that even the fine Batman Begins does not have. Yet Iron Man and Batman Begins have a lot in common in the way that they rework the tired ""superhero origin story"" replace stereotypes with legitimate characters and remember that everyone in the audience is not a 14-year old boy. When it comes to tone Iron Man achieves something at which many of even its most celebrated predecessors have failed it doesnt feel like a superhero movie. Instead its bigger and more inclusive. The superhero elements are present so devotees will not feel slighted or duped but Iron Man wants to be more than just a summer genre picture or an appetizer before the next exploit of a better-known icon. The movie justifies the hype and in addition to standing solidly on its own it promises bigger and potentially more interesting developments for the sequel that no one doubts will be made.

By David Denby Robert Downey Jr. plays the Marvel Comics character Tony Stark.   Credit JOHN RITTER In the past twenty years or so Robert Downey Jr. has gone through the following stages a good young actor with a melancholy smile; a good young actor who was also a drug addict jailbird and insurance risk; and now no longer young an actor who may become the first genuine hipster star since Robert Mitchum and Marlon Brando. Michael Keaton and George Clooney in the ""Batman"" series brought an instinct for satire to comic-book movies giving their mock-stentorian lines a twist. But Downey who completely dominates the whooshing junk pile that is ""Iron Man"" is on his own wavelength and he turns the movie into a hundred-and-eighty-five-million-dollar put-on. Sporting a neat dark Vandyke beard that cuts the air like a knife and complements his glittering black eyes Downey plays Tony Stark a billionaire arms manufacturer and playboy. Stark lives in a cliff-hanging Malibu mansion with a gigantic basement that serves as his toy room and his laboratory; his private jet comes equipped with female flight attendants who double as in-flight pole dancers. Nothing matters to him except inventing things and having a good time. Downey muttering to himself ignores everyone else in the movie for as long as he can. Fixing his eyes at last on another character he seems faintly annoyed that his privacy has been violated. Yet he delivers--to the camera and to us. He can make offhandedness mesmerizing even soulful; he passes through the key moments in this cloddish story as if he were ad-libbing his inner life. Back in 1963 Stan Lee working with his brother the writer Larry Lieber and with the artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby created the character of Tony Stark for the Marvel Comics series ""Tales of Suspense."" The war in Vietnam was heating up and Stark brought his newly invented supertransistors to the battlefield only to get captured and enslaved by Wong-Chu--a chubby Commie tyrant. One might blush at this memory of sinister Orientalist Cold War pop but the updating of the material for ""Iron Man"" hasnt made it any smarter. The director Jon Favreau and two writing teams Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway have enlisted Iron Man in the war on terror. Stark is now showing off his advanced missiles to American forces in Afghanistan. He gets ambushed by a mysterious group of burning-eyed men who hang out in caves and scream in foreign tongues. They are never identified though their leader Raza (Faran Tahir) says that they want to conquer the world. In any case the freelance fanatics or whatever they are waterboard Tony Stark which considering what some American interrogators and their surrogates have done to suspects recently is enraging to watch. Such are the ways of pop we cast our sins onto others. The complaint sounds a little wan but its worth noting that possibly more Americans will see this dunderheaded fantasia on its opening weekend than have seen all the features and documentaries that have labored to show whats happening in Iraq and on the home front. The fanatics demand that Stark build some of his missiles for them. Theyre a little careless these fellows though they watch Stark on video cameras for a long time they manage to miss the evidence that hes really making a gigantic suit of armor for himself. Downey beefed up his torso drenched in sweat looks like a nineteenth-century blacksmith. As he welds and solders using spare parts from spent shells (the insurgents possess some of Starks own products) the movie briefly becomes engaging as a kind of Erector Set dream of home manufacture. Yet the clanking suit when its finished is a letdown. Given its provenance we expect a patchwork--like the battered old spacecraft in ""Star Wars""--not the gleaming computer-generated steel plate that we get. And once Stark climbs inside and becomes Iron Man he loses his perverse charm; Downey without eyes is Downey cancelled. Iron Man shoots bullets and emits liquid flame from his gauntlets and when he gets bored he just flies away. Unlike Superman or Spider-Man this superhero has no vulnerabilities or specialized skills. Hes an all-purpose fighting vehicle--an airborne Robocop. At one point hes chased by two American F-22s and Favreau and his animators spin him around wildly in the air but the sequence is more clumsy than enthralling. Without a continuous infusion of visual poetry digital spectacle quickly burns through ones sense of awe. Theres a slightly depressed going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show. When Stark escapes and comes home now and then doing battle secretly as Iron Man almost every scene is played as a joke but apart from Downeys private sense of amusement the kidding lacks conviction. Gwyneth Paltrow widening her eyes and palpitating cant do much with an antique role as Starks girl Friday who loves him but cant say so; Terrence Howard playing a military man who chases around after Stark looks dispirited and taken for granted. Jeff Bridges though performs with skill and persistence as the movies true heavy--Obadiah Stane Starks treacherous No. 2 at the arms company. Downey keeps shrugging him off but Bridges who has the shaved head and thick beard of an outre professional wrestler from about 1958 refuses to be edged out of the picture. He bear-hugs Downey furiously all fake affection and murderous envy. The contest between the two begins to amount to something but then they disappear into their armor and battle like two oversized beetles. Will ""Iron Man"" become a franchise? Superhero fantasies have generally drawn their emotional energy from teen-age male frustration or from early wounds that shaped the heroes characters. Bruce Wayne sees his parents killed; Clark Kents home planet gets destroyed; the X-Men (and women) are outsiders--mutants--and Peter Parker is a nerd. But Tony Stark is more like James Bond--hes always on top. At the end Stark acknowledges to the public ""I am Iron Man"" setting up a possible sequel. Downey has a stars confidence now and if the audience takes to him he could probably do this insouciant acting turn again. But it would be a bad joke on him--his most unfortunate mishap--if he winds up clanking around in a metal suit forever. ""Then She Found Me"" the first film to be directed by Helen Hunt is about a thirty-nine-year-old grade-school teacher April (Hunt) who has the unsettling adventure of becoming a mother and a daughter at the same time. April has been brought up by adoptive parents but she has felt the absence of her own mother and father as if they were a pair of missing limbs. And shes terrified of losing out on motherhood herself. When her husband Ben (Matthew Broderick) a mousy teacher at the same school tries to tell her that he wants to leave her April ignores him and pulls him into bed. The next day the father of one of her students Frank (Colin Firth) comes on to her like a summer tempest. The British Firth has a cloud of dark hair a strong voice and a baleful stare. His temperament in its rages and its ardor owes something to the nineteenth century--he is best known here perhaps as a great Mr. Darcy in the 1995 BBC miniseries version of ""Pride and Prejudice."" In this movie hes a kind of domesticated Heathcliff issuing imperious commands and then collapsing into apologies or morose rants. April now pregnant with the child of her departing husband falls in love with this unsteady warrior a divorced man with two children of his own. With the screenwriters Alice Arlen and Victor Levin Hunt adapted the story from a 1990 novel by Elinor Lipman and has turned the material into a fine tense unpredictable comedy of mixed-up emotions and sudden illuminations. Hunt in her work as an actress has a talent for lucidity but lucid is exactly what April is not. She cant quite make out what she wants apart from a baby and Frank wounded and defensive after a failed marriage is irresolute and changeable too. ""Then She Found Me"" is about people acting on their immediate emotions and screwing themselves up. As if Aprils situation werent muddled enough her birth mother Bernice appears in the form of Bette Midler who barges into the movie like Shelley Winters on roller skates. A daytime-TV talk-show host Bernice is a force of nature--shes initially so rude and needy that it takes a while to realize that shes an intelligent woman--and April wants to hide from her. What makes this small movie work is the filmmakers curiosity about the many-sidedness of need--the way genuine benevolence say can be cloaked in blunt intrusiveness or the way insults can be a reckless demand for love. We get the feeling that these people are far from completed as personalities and that the movies end when it comes is more like a pause. With any luck Helen Hunt will continue to put complicated people on the screen.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Plus David Mamets sports flick. _ By David Edelstein Published Apr 28 2008 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) Every age gets not the superhero it deserves but the superhero it needs to ease its anxieties the midwestern farm boy who conquers metropolitan crime; the caped vigilante of the Gotham night; the tortured teen whose sticky excretions become a source of potency; the persecuted freaks whose differences empower them to save the normal folks. Now in Iron Man the first of the seasons megabudget comic-book spectaculars we get an American weapons mogul whose guilt over facilitating the deaths of U.S. soldiers and Mideast civilians impels him to turn off the arms pipeline and rescue Afghans from marauding warlords. The military-industrial complex ravages the Third Worldthen its former emissary swoops down from the sky in the guise of an impregnable weapon using his might (and money and American ingenuity) to undo the damage. Iron Man Akbar Its utter wish-fulfilling crap but when the whole world hates you it does feel good. Iron Man is a shapely piece of mythmaking. The director Jon Favreau doesnt go in for stylized comic-book frames at least in the first half. He gets real with ityoud think you were watching a military thriller. After jetting to Afghanistan to demonstrate a guided missile (which launches itty-bitty guided missiles) billionaire industrialist and conscienceless playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) gets kidnapped by insurgents who blow up his convoy and kill his Army escort. He wakes up in a cave where a kindly Afghan civilian (Shaun Toub) has inserted a magnet in his chest to keep the shrapnel from drifting to his vital organs. The bad guys order Stark to replicate his super-duper weapon. But are they in for a surprise The robotic Iron Man has little in the way of an expression but his eye slots and the circular magnet in his chest have an unearthly glow and his coloring is warmgold and trimmed with red like a sunset. Favreau keeps cutting to Downeys big head bouncing inside the helmet somewhat offsetting our knowledge that the Iron Man itself is entirely computer-generated. His first liftoff and crash landing owe a lot to Brad Birds incomparable The Iron Giantalthough Favreau would probably say its an homage. At least he steals from the best. A movie like this is a sound designers wet dream thunk squish clank whir kaboom. The heavy-metal rock that kicks in when Iron Man appears is an aural pun that works like gangbustersalthough I wish there were a melody in there somewhere. BACKSTORY A film eighteen years in development Iron Man passed through several studios before Marvel bought the rights in 2006 and brought in Elf director Jon Favreau who plans to spin it into a trilogy. In a Yahoo Movies clip about the James Bondworthy set (perched on Point Doom overlooking the Pacific) Favreau zipping around on a Segway looks every bit as zhlubby as he did when he co-starred with Vince Vaughn in Swingers. In the movie itself he makes a cameo appearance as Tony Starks bodyguard Happy Hogan. First chapters of superhero sagas are more alike than unalike The hero tests out his new powers (painfully) amazes his friends and foes and makes his auspicious debut before the wider world. (What is it? Where did it come from? Is it friendly? Is there a franchise in it?) Then theres a villain who gets hold of the same technology and uses it for evil instead of goodthats Obadiah Stane played by Jeff Bridges with a little beard and a bald dome making his bid both for Starks superpowers and William Hurts hold on the ex-leading-man hambone character-actor market. The casting alone generates tons of goodwill. Who wouldnt root for Downey as a guy who has to clean up his act? His Stark is a sex addict a fast-talking heel whose jokes about his own irresponsibility are a hedge against growing up. Downey has such terrific instincts. He demonstrates his transformation by looking as if he has been yanked out of a blissful dream; his self-love dries up and so does his shtick. His loyal assistant Pepper Potts isnt much of a part but Gwyneth Paltrow is a presence. She stands around looking amused and flabbergastingly pretty slinging wisecracks with serene aplomb. Bridges makes Stane scarily at ease with his villainy. Hes an inspiring actor His movie-star vanity never gets in the way of his playing an asshole. Only Terrence Howard as Starks military liaison Rhodey seems ill used Hes perilously close to being Jim to Downeys Huck. Or maybe hes supposed to be Colin Powell. Blockbuster action movies often pick up on bad vibes in the air and transform them into something that lets us sleep better at night. In 1989 the same summer Spike Lee dramatized our seemingly unbridgeable differences in Do the Right Thing Hollywood gave us Lethal Weapon 2 in which an unruly white guy and a middle-class black family man collaborated to destroy the evil representatives of South African apartheid. Poofracial divisions melted away in a show of righteous force. Iron Man is more family-friendly but its in the same liberal-fantasy tradition. And dont misunderstandI loved it. Id so rather think about blockbusters than bunker-busters (or the Democratic primary). Its always fun to watch David Mamet Mametize another film genre the heist picture (Heist) the red-meat war movie (Spartan) and now in Redbelt the go-for-it sports drama. So hows the Mamet Rocky? Fast. Lively. In your face. Very watchable. And like its predecessors so bizarrely convoluted it barely holds together on a narrative level. But the underpinnings are consistent. As Mamet has evolved into a confident and resourceful film director his worldview has hardly budged. Whats changed is that his movie heroes manage to protect themselves from lifes inevitable betrayals. 1 2 Next Share this story...

TWITTER Should catch box office lightning in a bottle thanks to hiring longtime Marvel Comics reader Jon Favreau as director and the super smart casting of Robert Downey Jr. as the conflicted protagonist. You gotta love a middle-aged wreck as a superhero. Iron Man may not make the A-list of Marvel Comics stable -- home to Spider-Man X-Men and the Hulk -- but he may be the cinema superhero for the rest of us. No spider bite or genetic mutation produces him. Rather he springs from good old American ingenuity the brainchild of his creator and impersonator Tony Stark a character modeled in part on genius-playboy Howard Hughes. Tony wears his character flaws like badges of honor yet Iron Man represents a midlife correction. ""Iron Man"" the first self-financed production from Marvel Studios should catch boxoffice lightning in a bottle thanks to hiring longtime Marvel Comics reader Jon Favreau as director and the supersmart casting of Robert Downey Jr. as the conflicted protagonist. The betting line about opening weekend grosses really pales in significance to the real question Will the film imitate its heros ability to blast into the stratosphere for many weeks? The guess here is a big yes. The entire film written by Mark Fergus amp; Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum amp; Matt Holloway is devoted to how Tony Stark the top U.S. weapons manufacturer and all-around playboy becomes Iron Man. A kidnapping by insurgents in Afghanistan forces Tony to invent a crude prototype to escape captivity. (His captors are a little too dumb for belief to think he is actually assembling a weapon for them.) Back in his Malibu home having witnessed U.S. soldiers slaughtered with his weaponry he declares himself out of that business for good. While his partner Obadiah Stane (a marvelously malevolent Jeff Bridges) seizes control of the company Tony perfects his red-and-gold weapons suit with a somewhat ill-defined plan to use it for good. The film neatly borrows from a raft of both real and science-fiction technologies as well as previous sci-fi movies to propel the fast-paced two-hour film. In his home basement (think Bat Cave) Tony can talk to his computers and robotics (think R2-D2) while his suit starts to resemble RoboCop on human growth hormones. The space flights and acrobatics over Los Angeles evoke Spider-Man. Yet the whole package is distinctly its own a tale originated in the 60s cleverly and logically transposed into todays world. Downey plays off his own bad-boy image wonderfully. The writers give him great lines to work with and ditto that for his Girl Friday Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper Potts whose own svelte lines cannot be improved on. Key disappointment is a climatic battle between different Iron Man prototypes which is both illogical -- how did Tonys nemesis learn how to use the suit? -- and derivative of many other superhero climaxes. Never mind. Marvel has several more sequels to upgrade ""Iron Man.""

Finally someones found a sure-fire way to make money with a modern Middle East war movie Just send a Marvel superhero into the fray to kick some insurgent butt. The powerhouse comicbook-inspired actioner ""Iron Man"" isnt principally about this fantasy but it wont hurt at least American audiences enjoyment of this expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza. Having an actor as supercharged as Robert Downey Jr. at the center of such a tech-oriented enterprise reps a huge plus and Paramount should reap big B.O. rewards by getting out ahead of the summer tentpole pack with such a classy refitting of an overworked format. Its refreshing for a start that the character suddenly endowed with superpowers isnt a dweeby teen but rather a pushing-middle-age genius who is himself entirely responsible for the advanced means he acquires to combat his adversaries; even more than the latest incarnation of Batman hes a self-made superman. And while weve seen plenty of masks and gravity-resistant heroes before the outfit sported by the main man here which looks as though it was made by a top ski boot manufacturer is striking and capable of great things. Half-hour setup neatly dovetails essential character background with the flawed heros extreme imperilment. Imperious sarcastic and arrogant Tony Stark (Downey) creates the worlds most sophisticated weapons for the U.S. Army. A boozer and brash ladies man the gazillionaire (originally based to a great extent on Howard Hughes) inherited Stark Industries from his late father and runs the company with his dads partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Praised as a technological Da Vinci and reviled as ""the merchant of death"" this is a man who always gets what he wants. On a demonstration trip to Afghanistan however Tony is ambushed and kidnapped by swarthy insurgent types who take him to a cave connect him to a bomb and command him to make them his latest and greatest weapon. Despite being closely watched the devious dude surreptitiously creates a sort of high-tech armor suit that turns him into ""a destructive Robbie the Robot"" and enables him to thwart his captors and fly off into the desert where he promptly crashes before being rescued by Yanks. Tony arrives back home a changed man. Revealing that during captivity he ""realized I have more to offer the world than making things that blow up"" Tony announces his exit from the arms business which sends his huge firms stock plummeting and pits the ruthless Obadiah against him. Trying to settle on what to do with his life Tony begins fashioning a more sophisticated version of his jerry-rigged suit and one of the films most delightful scenes has him making a trial run in his warehouse; seamless visual effects allow an encased Tony to hover and rocket around via boot and glove jets. In a memorable maiden voyage he zooms out of his Malibu h.q. and shoots above Santa Monica on his way to testing the outer atmospheric limits of his marvelous invention. At the same time the bad boys back in Afghanistan are patching together the broken remains of Tonys original improvised suit and wreaking havoc on the local populace with a cache of stolen Stark weapons. Its easy to see where this is headed and it isnt long before Tony is high-flying it back for a little precision target practice at the expense of the nasties. (Only the snide will wonder why he doesnt stop off in Iraq on the way home to put things in order there.) Foreign kidnap-and-revenge format actually recycles the initial ""Iron Man"" storyline from the April 1963 Marvel comic in which the heavies were Vietcong. Current villains do not espouse any particular religion or ideology although their leader the bald-headed Raza (Faran Tahir) professes a desire to become the new Genghis Khan. Tonys self-appointed role as international enforcer doesnt go down well with U.S. officials including his Pentagon pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard) and another action highlight has supersonic Iron Man in a wild dogfight with a couple of American fighter jets. With foreign devils out of the way at least for the moment the final acts dynamic pits Tony against turncoat Obadiah. Although kids will probably like it the climactic giant suit vs. giant suit battle which with its machines multitude of moving parts and resultant clanging metal smacks all too much of ""Transformers"" is the pics only disappointment. Talent lineup on both sides of the camera injects familiar conceits with fresh energy and stylistic polish. The work of two screenwriting teams -- Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby (""Children of Men"") and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway -- have been blended effectively to keep the plot moving and provide motor-mouthed Downey with plenty of snappy dialogue. Ever-eclectic director Jon Favreau who briefly pops up onscreen as a Stark minion maintains a brisk but not frantic pace and in concert with lenser Matthew Libatique production designer J. Michael Riva and the first-rate visual effects team has made an unusually elegant looking film for the genre. Snapping off lines as crisply as Bugs Bunny might bite into a carrot the sculpture-bearded Downey invigorates the entire proceedings in a way no other actor ever has in this field. Initially conveying Tonys Matt Helm lifestyle as if its second nature Downey possesses a one-of-a-kind intensity that perfectly serves the characters second-act drive and obstinacy. His Achilles heel is his heart at first threatened by shrapnel and later central to his superpower and his submerged romantic relationship with ever-loyal assistant Pepper Potts who Gwyneth Paltrow in an unexpected casting move endows with smarts and appeal. Shaven-headed and sporting a bushy beard in a way that makes him rather resemble Bruce Willis Bridges is an imposing antagonist. Other roles including Howards second-billed Army officer are one-dimensional. All tech credits are tops.

On a routine sales trip to the Middle East his Humvee is ambushed by a terrorist cell and he is dragged away to a cave where he is forced to reproduce one of his high-powered missiles with some scrap metal and a soldering iron.Instead Stark uses those materials to construct a suit of robotic body armour and flee from the extremists clutches. This channels his epiphany -  perhaps long overdue - that profiteering from weapons is far from the Promethean zenith of overarching compassion he once thought it was. He returns a changed man and with the help of his svelte assistant Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and best mate Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) builds a shiny suit of armour with which he plans to put an end to warfare for good.All this liberal hand-wringing comes much to the chagrin of the  sinisterly named Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) Starks devious benefactor who doesnt shine to his peacenik jabbering one bit. Stane sports both a bald pate and a beard a red flag combination in comic-book land if ever there was one.Actor-turned-director Jon Favreau has proved with his past directorial efforts including buddy comedy Made Christmas film Elf and kids fantasy Zathura that he has a keen eye for character and can spin a decent yarn. Sadly these two qualities are rarely apparent here replaced instead by quick-fix one-liners and predictable set-piece gags. Like Iron Mans suit Favreaus film feels like it has been meticulously assembled rather than lovingly formed. Its little more than an elongated episodic and sporadically charming introduction to the life of this mechanised millionaire superhero light on both CGI and moral quandaries and possessing neither the zip and sparkle of a Spider-Man nor the brooding existential subtexts of Batman Begins.

In his review (below) he complains simultaneously that this comic book movie doesnt have enough action. Then he complains that it is not more dramatically derived from stage-style storytelling. So does he want Terminator 2 or Casablanca? Then he goes on to tell us he wants and expects more but hes dreading sequels. Lets get our heads screwed on straight...all together now...are you with us Mr. Boris? This is a comic book movie. The story quality is aimed for the mind of a teenager. Thats how comics work. People dont go to superhero movies expecting mental flickers of Shakespeare. This will not be Casablanca or Hamlet. Drama is in the other section; this is Action. Nevertheless this being the first in the Iron Man franchise the storyteller must give us our bearings first. He must answer for us ""Who are these characters? What elements are present (desires alliances struggles etc.) and how do they connect or collide? Favreau clearly loves comics (including Daredevil) and being a part in bringing them to the movie screen whether via cameo or directors chair. (Hes got my vote of gratitude right there.) And he does a good job of interspersing the action with the exposition. The 1st Fantastic 4 movie didnt balance so well other than a few stunts there was no action until the last 5-10 minutes of the film...and it was no crescendo by any means This movie advances in 3 Acts which is very traditional. Act 1 The abduction of Tony Stark and the invention of Iron Man leading to a dynamic shift in his character and the development of his motive. Act 2 A buildup--we meet all the players discover their relationship dynamics see the development of the suit and the ""suitor"" (a-la-Whos the Boss.) We especially learn the powers and limitations of the suit and then the alliances shift... Act 3 The climax--including an attack and counter attack which play on both the strengths and the limitations of both the suits and the relationships weve learned about thus far. And then the (by now) much welcome setup for a sequel. (Thats why they call it a ""franchise."") And trust me Mr. Boris (and his fellow detractors) theres more than enough compelling storyline in the 300+ issues of Iron Man comic books to make a sequel that rocks. So to sum it up yes my girlfriend likes this as much as I do but I confess I havent read more than a dozen issues of Iron Man in my life. There is romance sardonic wit a few plot twists CG that one-ups the Transformers movie some infinitely quotable one-liners and plenty of humor. True fans want to see their imaginations realized onscreen--they want to see Iron Man flex his muscle and use his gadgets. I predict fans will leave quite satisfied. Girlfriends and other newbies to the Iron Man storyline want to see Robert Downey Jr. make a respectably-spotlit comeback into pop-cinema and they need a good dose of ""Iron Man 101"" to understand whats happening. I predict they will leave as fans baited with the desire to learn more and see more of this iconic superhero. Robert Downey Jr. does Iron Man justice but the trick isnt being inside a suit and launching tank-poppers. What RD Jr. does best is breathe life and accuracy into Tony Stark...like your favorite NBA team he has the look and all the game to go with it. This movie juggles 2 storylines. One about a jet-bashing computer-guided robo-suit (that kicks RoboCops dated can.) Its also about a dynamic person with believable relatable issues (which trumps Peter Wellers ""Murphy"" in every way.) It is a comic book movie. And its the best one to date in my opinion. Like Mr. Boris I want more from Iron Man and I realize there are only 2 ways to get it sequels and return-trips to the cinema (I wouldnt complain about either.) P.S.gt; Did I mention that I LOVE Paul Bettany for the role of Jarvis? Thats just icing on the cake.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 27 2008GodsingerFeaturedIm going to address Mr. Boriss comments first then the movie itself. In his review (below) he complains simultaneously that this comic book movie doesnt have enough action. Then he complains that it is not more dramatically derived from stage-style storytelling. So does he want Terminator 2 or Casablanca? Then he goes on to tell us he wants and expects more but hes dreading sequels. Lets get our heads screwed on straight...all together now...are you with us Mr. Boris? This is a comic book movie. The story quality is aimed for the mind of a teenager. Thats how comics work. People dont go to superhero movies expecting mental flickers of Shakespeare. This will not be Casablanca or Hamlet. Drama is in the other section; this is Action.

The one thing that I felt was lacking was that it needed more fight sequences More chances to see the suit systems in action. But then they are no doubt saving that up for the sequel.
