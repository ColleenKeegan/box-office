"Anonymous | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; anonymous ) Anonymous (United Kingdom/Germany 2011) October 30 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Those who question the authorship of Shakespeares plays are like Climate Change deniers - despite being in a minority they are tenacious and passionate. Though a surfeit of facts are against them they are able to make some good points that the opposition has difficulty countering or debunking. From my perspective its a matter of little concern whether the canon we identify with William Shakespeare was scribed by the actor-turned-playwright from Stratford or whether the author was Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford. What is important is that the plays exist and they are among the best-written in the history of the English language. Whoever wrote them - Shakespeare de Vere or someone else - has been dead for 400 years. Hes not going to care one way or the other. Anonymous advances the cause of so-called ""Oxfordianism"" but chooses the most salacious variation amplifying the sex violence and betrayal to make for a more entertaining motion picture. This also has the intended effect of transforming the movies narrative into a tragedy with Shakespearean overtones. For the most part Anonymous functions as a cross between Elizabeth and Shakespeare in Love with all the political machinations skullduggery and opportunism one expects from such a story. Ultimately the screenplay is as concerned about the end of Elizabeths reign and the succession as it is about how Shakespeare became famous by publishing another mans plays. File this one in the category of entertaining historical fiction. There are facts here but one must possess more than a passing familiarity with history to be able to spot them. Perhaps surprisingly Anonymous opens in the present day with narrator Derek Jacobi taking the stage to provide a quick primer on the tenets of Oxfordianism. We are then thrown back more than four centuries to the waning years of Queen Elizabeths court. Edward de Vere (Rhys Ifans) who is unable to publish plays under his own name because such an avocation is unworthy of an Earl has chosen playwright Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto) to be his stand-in. However when Johnson waffles one of his actors William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) steps into the breach. Meanwhile as Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave) approaches the end various candidates for the next king of England come to light. The favorite is James VI the King of Scotland. He is favored by Elizabeths closest advisors William Cecil (David Thewlis) and his son Robert (Edward Hogg). The other main contender is one of Elizabeths illegitimate sons the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) a hothead who is supported by de Vere and several other influential nobles. Two key characters are represented counter to their popular images. Shakespeare normally thought of as scholarly and erudite is developed as an unprincipled schemer who is in the right place at the right time and is able to pull off the charade despite the fact that hes an illiterate moron. Elizabeth often viewed as chaste and virginal is hot-blooded and sexual having borne at least three illegitimate sons and having a dark secret concerning one of them. This portrayal of Elizabeth is at variance with the ones of Elizabeth and Shakespeare in Love. The production design is superb with director Roland Emmerich and his crew having effectively transformed a soundstage into Elizabethan England. The re-creations of The Globe and The Rose theaters are especially well-done. They provide a sense unlike that of any other movie of what it was like to see a play in these settings. Anonymous treats us to a highlight reel of Shakespeares greatest hits from the witches in MacBeth to ""Et tu Brute"" in Julius Caesar to the ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy in Hamlet. Despite being best known for his special effects-laden lobotomy-required-for-enjoyment blockbusters like Independence Day Godzilla and 2012 Emmerich seems entirely at home in this smarter more low-key setting. Anonymous is well-paced and never threatens to bore or become too scholarly. The cast which is devoid of splashy Hollywood stars features Rhys Ifans in the lead role. Ifans known primarily for his portrayal of fatuous and comedic characters might seem an odd choice for what is a purely dramatic part but this gives him an opportunity to display his range. Hes very good and never seems out of his depth. Vanessa Redgrave offers a regal portrayal of the fading queen who maintains an aura of quiet authority even as her physical and mental capabilities decline. Redgraves daughter Joely Richardson plays a younger version of the queen during flashbacks. The rest of the cast is comprised of character actors such as David Thewlis and Rafe Spall. Anonymous is a problematic movie to market and sell. The material will play better to those with a love of Shakespeare and an understanding of his era but the film has been designed with a general audience in mind. As a result this becomes an art house production playing in multiplexes which is not ideal for finding the right viewership - at least until it reaches home video. Anonymous is good enough to be seen in a theater - in fact the spectacular production design will lose something on the small screen. The films thesis - that de Vere not Shakespeare created the English languages most beloved plays - may be shaky when examined on a purely factual basis but those who believe the movie will have no doubts.

Columbia Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Anonymous"" set inside the nefarious political court of Elizabethan England is about Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans) the rightful author of the plays falsely attributed to that nincompoop imposter William Shakespeare.Full disclosure I think Shakespeare wrote the plays and this is all hooey. But more on that in a moment. How does the film stand up as a ""What if?"" historical drama?Answer Not too well. John Orloffs screenplay could have used a rewrite by de Vere - or whomever. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The conceit here is that de Vere was too highly placed to reveal his identity and so he dragooned poor Shakespeare (via Ben Jonson his first choice) into acting as his front. Lest you think that Orloff and the films director Roland Emmerich are content to besmirch only Shakespeares name you should also know that Queen Elizabeth herself (played in a neat bit of then-and-now casting by the mother-daughter team of Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson) also gets it in the neck. Elizabeth it seems was not exactly the Virgin Queen after all. In fact de Vere was her.... But now Ive told too much already. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gallery The top 10 highest-grossing films The Elizabethan period re-creations are imposing but since the action going on in them is so outlandish the effort is all for naught. Ifans normally a knockabout actor is dulled out here with a snooty rectitude. As Jonson Sebastian Armesto is impressive but smolders in a vacuum. Whenever things get bogged down in confusing courtly intrigues Emmerich tosses in a punch-out or a fencing match. Groundlings carouse as only groundlings can.As William Cecil Elizabeths chief adviser David Thewlis seems to have a difficult time making himself heard through his beard. Cecils son Robert (Edward Hogg) is even scurvier than his dad plus he has a hunchback - the inspiration apparently for Shakespeares I mean de Veres - Richard III. (One of the films many annoyances is that it regards the plays as mere extenuations of de Veres political ambitions.)If ""Anonymous"" were simply a lousy movie Id leave it at this. But movies have a way of serving as history texts for gullible audiences. Remember how many people took Oliver Stones ""JFK"" seriously at the time? According to James Shapiro the author of the definitive pro-Bard book ""Contested Will Who Wrote Shakespeare?"" Sony Pictures is reportedly distributing Shakespeare-debunking lesson plans for literature and history teachers. ""A documentary by First Folio Pictures (of which Mr. Emmerich is president) will also be part of this campaign"" writes Mr. Shapiro in The New York Times.This is monstrous. For the record de Vere died in 1604 before you know ""Othello"" and ""King Lear"" and ""The Tempest"" were written. (The film has him writing ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"" at age 9) But its easy to see why de Vere has his champions among those who want to believe that only a man of high position and breeding could have written the plays. This is rank classism posing as scholarship.Frankly if Im going to be offered a heaping pile of revisionism about the greatest writer who ever lived Id rather it be from someone with more academic heft than the director of ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla."" I trust the teachers who receive this films study guide have a shredder handy. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for some violence and sexual content.)

Think of ""Anonymous"" more along the lines of the bosomy intrigue and nighttime-soap operatics ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and less akin to the more serious ""Elizabeth"" and youll be in the right frame of mind for this trashy treat. Sir Derek Jacobi one of this generations leading interpreters of the Bard struts upon a Broadway stage and begins spelling out the case against the working-class semi-illiterate Shakespeare having been the author of his timeless works. As Jacobis speech ends were on the muddy pestilent streets of 17th century London where playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) is on the run from royal guards hiding a cache of manuscripts. The provenance of those papers takes us into multiple flashbacks wherein Emmerich and screenwriter John Orloff (""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of Gahoole"") posit that the real author behind ""Richard III"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" was Edward de Vere (Rhys Ifans) the 17th Earl of Oxford. Having to keep his identity hidden for a variety of reasons -- most of them having to do with his powerful and treacherous father-in-law William Cecil (David Thewlis) -- Edward pays Jonson to take credit for his work. Having seen audiences moved by works of theater Edward realizes that this medium can be used to rally the masses and score political points against those in power. But since Jonson has his own writing career (with an ego to match) he winds up sub-contracting the gig as Edwards front to William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) a boozy actor who eventually lets his unearned fame go to his head. ""Anonymous"" periodically pops out Shakespeares Greatest Hits like the assassination of Julius Caesar or Henry V giving the St. Crispins Day speech always in a way that advances Edwards political plotting of the moment. (If you were hoping for moments from ""Cymbeline"" or ""Troilus and Cressida"" forget it; the movie sticks to the best-known works and only presents them in a plot-advancing context.) Also read Rhys Ifans on Anonymous A Relief to Be Fully Clothed for Once Knowing that non-""Masterpiece Theater"" audiences will grow fidgety over this sort of thing Emmerich and Orloff throw in plenty of sword-fighting bear-baiting and bodice-ripping. (The latter literally occurs when Queen Elizabeth I played memorably by Vanessa Redgrave loosens her corset over being so moved by the intrigues of ""Hamlet."") Much of the villainy here is of the mustache-twirling variety. The palace intrigue is spelled out in broad strokes so that even the groundlings can follow it; its the sort of movie where the clouds burst forth only when it can rain on someone significantly. But for all of its excesses ""Anonymous"" is never dull and it always looks terrific. Supervising art director Stephan O. Gessler and his team make everything from dingy pubs lit by firelight to the royal bedchambers feel lived-in and realistic. Ifans who has made his deepest impression playing literally shaggy characters in films like ""Notting Hill"" cleans up extraordinarily well giving Edward de Vere the soul of an artist combined with the necessary deviousness to survive in court. (Jamie Campbell Bower a vet of both the ""Twilight"" and ""Harry Potter"" franchises comes off like a cross between Matthew Lillard and ""the cute one"" from any 90s boy band as the young Edward.) Redgrave and her daughter Joely Richardson make a nifty set of bookends as the older and younger Elizabeth respectively and best of all is Thewlis who takes what could have been a cardboard bad-guy and imbues him with a chilling lust for power. His presence lingers on even after William Cecils death and helps make a long third-act monologue by Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg) -- explaining everything that Edward and the audience hasnt known up until that point -- more bearable. Freshmen in English Lit classes of the future would be advised not to take the theories of ""Anonymous"" as gospel but if youre in the mood to watch people in doublets stab each other through curtains and angrily slam down flagons of ale youll have fun with this tale of sound and fury.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Anonymous Rated PG-13  130 minutes  2011 Queen Elizabeth has hot sex on the throne and William Shakespeare crowd-surfs at the curtain call for Hamlet in this period piece from disaster-movie maestro Roland Emmerich (Independence Day The Day After Tomorrow). The film dramatizes the theory that Shakespeares plays were in fact written by Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford; this argument has had sympathizers ranging from Orson Welles to Justice John Paul Stevens though Emmerichs overblown approach is unlikely to inspire any new converts. Still this is irresistible as self-knowing camp the players ham it up in high fashion and the script crams at least one lurid revelation into every scene.

That scenario is more plausible than the theory floated by Emmerichs new film Anonymous (Columbia Pictures) a febrile alternative history of the genesis of the 37 plays 154 sonnets and assorted narrative poems that most of us fools that we are attribute to a glove-makers son from Stratford named William Shakespeare. Advertisement The truth is Ive been jazzed about the arrival of Anonymous for over a year ever since attending a wonderfully bizarre publicity junket in Berlin where the film was being shot at the historic Babelsberg studios. I loved 2012s campy self-assurance the cheerful dumbness of its appetite for destruction. The idea of Emmerich one of Hollywoods looniest big-budget auteurs taking on a project this certifiably bananas was somehow thrilling. But whats disappointing about Anonymous is that it isnt dumb enough. Rather than plunging merrily ahead with its fanciful counternarrative the movie keeps stopping to actually seriously make its case--to posit and explain and persuade. A conspiracy-theory movie about Shakespeare might work if it were playful and clever a trickster fable on the order of Steven Spielbergs Catch Me if You Can. Instead Emmerichs film plods solemnly back and forth between two poorly integrated plotlines one involving Elizabethan court intrigue the other backstage chicanery. Emmerichs big mistake was to approach the material as tragedy rather than comedy. Screenwriter John Orloff tells the story of the man who would be Shakespeare as a third-rate ripoff of Hamlet when it could have been a second-rate ripoff of Twelfth Night. From its opening frames Anonymous feels portentous and didactic. In a questionably necessary scaffolding story the Shakespearean stage actor Derek Jacobi appears on a modern-day stage for some scene-setting defamation of the Bards name ""What would you think if I told you that Shakespeare never wrote a single word?"" Flashback to a heavily CGI-augmented version of 16th-century London where all manner of aristocratic trickery is afoot. The hunchbacked high courtier Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg) has arrested playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) for sedition. Cecil suspects that Jonson has a secret hes not telling and hes right--Jonson knows that the Earl of Oxford Edward De Vere (Rhys Ifans) is secretly the author of the popular plays attributed to William Shakespeare. Because his works critique those in high places--and because apparently of the shame conferred by inky fingers--De Vere has chosen to hide behind a pseudonym. He tries to persuade Jonson to be his beard but in a moment of spontaneous opportunism Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) a barely literate dolt in the company that performs the plays attributed to ""Anonymous"" seizes a copy of a play after a performance and passes it off as his own. In a dreary subplot--really more of a co-plot since it takes up almost half the movie--two young noblemen the Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel) and the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) lead an attempted rebellion against Queen Elizabeth (Joely Richardson as a young woman; her mother Vanessa Redgrave as an older one). There are reasons for this rebellion that involve succession disputes and the Stuart dynasty in Scotland but honestly lifes too short to get into them here. All you need to know is that Elizabeths reputation as the Virgin Queen is shall we say unearned--for years the court has been shipping off the bastard children born of her affairs to be raised by families unaware of their royal provenance. The movies middle section is a blur of doublets and double-crosses so overstuffed with character and incident that it soon becomes impossible to keep up with the multiple time frames. (We see De Vere played at three separate ages by different actors.) The playwright Christopher Marlowe is mysteriously murdered. The queen takes a lover. Traitors are beheaded legacies questioned and scandalous truths revealed. Once in a while we get to see a fragment of a Shakespeare play--Bottoms song from A Midsummer Nights Dream the St. Crispins Day speech from Henry V--that reminds us why we cared about this story in the first place. (Royal Shakespeare Company veteran Mark Rylance an authorship skeptic in real life plays actor Richard Burbage and in the brief glimpses we get of him on stage hes sensational.) Vanessa Redgrave working with way sub-Shakespearean material does invent some brilliant bits of business for Queen Bess--in one scene alone with her closest adviser she plonks herself unceremoniously down on the base of the throne reminding us that even sixteenth-century monarchs must have had their moments of unfiltered intimacy. An autopsy for Anonymous would have to list multiple causes of death with its dopey high-concept premise not even first among them. Most fundamentally this movie doesnt seem to know who its protagonist is. De Vere is a petulant fop who disappears for long portions of the narrative and Shakespeare is a mouth-breathing doofus who barely appears at all. (Spalls performance as the status-hungry moron from Stratford is appealingly broad--when he surfs an adoring crowd after a performance of Henry V you see the lighthearted satire this could have been.) Late in the movie theres a suggestion of a lifelong Amadeus-style rivalry between De Vere and Ben Jonson but the subplot is never developed enough to engage us in their relationship. By the time De Vere is on his deathbed agonizing over his legacy were more than ready to say ""Goodnight sweet prince."" If youre unfamiliar with the ludicrously refutable ""debate"" around Shakespeare authorship you may have trouble following the plot of this muddled movie at all. But dont take that as a reason to read the doubters and then see Anonymous. Take it as an excuse to skip them both and read As You Like It.

The great director had made films diverse Of creatures from space and monsters much worse Tales of ""The Patriot"" and ""Godzilla"" ""2012"" - the whole megillah And so surfeit with grand chests of cold cash This merchant of cheese now did something rash Something quite rare unexpected and hard - Yon schlocker would do the life of the Bard But twould not be the great man of Avon You buy that fiction? Fie Are you ravin? No tis time to take up the fringes cause (And ignore its nonsense see not its flaws) ""Hamlet""? ""Macbeth""? Not the work of Shakespeare But that of a noble Edward de Vere And so like vermin facts here are banished Logic dispelled plain motives all vanished The sly games of Eros come unbidden The sad death of Marlowe? Quite rewritten And poor old Will is tossed out with the junk A braggart idiot tiresome drunk While the high-born de Vere sly posing fop Is ensconced on dramas great mountaintop Of course this strange tale has been told before And this action auteur dares not to bore So bodkins are bared (and young bodies too) Dark plots are hatched and fine wenches are wooed Yea a turn by great stage star Mark Rylance Provides one bright spot in this fitful dance And other Brit actors both great and small Take their places too and true give their all The Virgin Queen of Vanessa Redgrave Here flirty and aging nervous and brave Or de Vere himself (a scene-stealing part) Played by Rhys Ifans as witty and smart But all this great pageant and mystery Cannot conceal rewrites of history In which Ben Jonson meant nothing he said And de Vere wrote after he was long dead - All to enable this trick so immense And fuel a resentment obscure intense The reason behind it? Perhaps a snob Who sees Shakespeare as just part of the mob A poor merchants son who knew his duty But had no great art skill or true beauty For that belongs to aristocracy (A wretched thought in this democracy) Nay if we have learned something about art Its that it comes from the mind and the heart And to be a true artist of renown Requires but wit - not riches nor crown These dramas just needed a man with Will A towering talent one sturdy quill Who rose far above his quite modest birth To inspire all who write on this earth Even myself unrepentant old ham Who boldly declares ""I am what iamb"" So if I here bored you pray do not curse For prose which is poor can always be verse Ratings note The film contains much violence and harlots/And language thats fit only for varlets Anonymous (PG-13) Sony (129 min.)

Rhys Ifans plays the 17th Earl of Oxford who in the preposterous calculus of Anonymous is the ""real"" author of Shakespeares plays.

That is the question -- at least according to Roland Emmerichs new movie Anonymous. Personally I went in a skeptic of the Oxfordian position which posits that Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford wrote the plays and poems generally attributed to Shakespeare. But I have to concede that Anonymous raises one question of authorship pretty persuasively I mean what a preposterous notion ... that Roland Emmerich couldve made this movie. The guy who revived Godzilla went to war with aliens in Independence Day and trashed the whole world in 2012. Cmon Were supposed to believe hes suddenly concerning himself with doublets corsets elaborate facial hair and the intrigues of Elizabethan England? Ridiculous Especially when there are so many likelier director possibilities Kenneth Branagh for one. Or how about Laurence Olivier who admittedly has the disadvantage of being dead. Then again why should that be a problem? Anonymous after all claims that de Vere wrote Shakespeares plays even though he died before about a dozen of them were produced. Youth in screenwriter John Orloffs chronology isnt a problem either Witness de Vere wowing a youngish Queen Elizabeth by starring in his own Midsummer Nights Dream when hes all of 9 years old. Elizabeth (played by Joely Richardson at this point and later by her mom Vanessa Redgrave) is almost 30 in that scene but already she and young Edward sense a connection. By the time hes in his late teens (when hes played by Jamie Campbell Bower who resembles the older Edward played by Rhys Ifans not at all) he and his randy virgin queen have produced an illegitimate heir who will end up -- if Im not confusing moustaches in a crowd where everyone seems to go to the same barber -- as best buddy to the Earl of Essex a guy Edward will later push as Elizabeths successor. Hes sort of a frustrated politician see when hes not furiously writing plays that he hopes to fob off on some other playwright. Overcomplicated? All the best conspiracy theories are. Enter a buffoonish basically illiterate actor named Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) whos game to be paid as a playwright but would really prefer to act in the plays. Now as silly as most of this is Anonymous is undeniably a handsome picture. The costumes are gorgeous with enough velvet and brocade to make everybody seem downright upholstered. Interior scenes are lush lit to evoke 17th-century canvases while exteriors are often breathtaking with computer graphics allowing soaring shots over the muddy streets of a digital London. When de Vere decides to use Richard III to whip a theater audience into a political frenzy the mob looks persuasive enough as it takes to the streets that for some viewers it may not matter that the storys chronology doesnt work -- or that none of this actually happened. Bottom line Grant the films big moments a kind of loopy majesty and note that theyre better acted than they deserve to be not just by Ifans Redgrave and Spall but by David Thewlis and Edward Hogg as the villainous father-son team of William and Robert Cecil. Its a classy cast. Still plot matters and Im guessing that this films plot will prove incoherent for folks who cant identify Ben Jonson Robert Cecil and the 2nd Earl of Essex -- and itll prove exasperating for those who can. Also frustrating for anyone who worries that Anonymouss take on a classic like Richard III -- it basically turns one of Shakespeares tighter history plays into a mere propaganda tool -- diminishes the work itself. Yknow the proof-demanding academic crowd -- wholl no doubt spend that scene and maybe the whole rest of the movie muttering ""A source a source my kingdom for a source.""

The maker of such cataclysm-courting action pics as ""2012"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Independence Day"" has set this literary period piece in the 16th century where his usual blow-stuff-up tricks would seem anachronistic. Yes there are a couple of fires and some musket play but no wholesale destruction. Unless that is youre attached to the notion that William Shakespeare was responsible for the writings of said William Shakespeare. There is plenty of controversy about that matter and has been since the mid-18th century according to James Shapiros terrifically readable examination of the authorship dispute ""Contested Will ""Who Wrote Shakespeare?"" Was the writer of 37 plays and 154 sonnets the son of John Shakespeare the glover? Was he an actor and part-theater owner who had a tremendously prolific writers spurt then fell silent retiring to Stratford-upon-Avon? Or was the writer some other much-more-learned personage? Sir Francis Bacon has been a popular alternative; the playwright Christopher Marlowe is another oft-mentioned surrogate. This drama favors Edward de Vere. The 17th Earl of Oxford is played with pang and pride (how Shakespearean) by Rhys Ifans. ""Anonymous"" begins with one of Will Shakespeares real-life doubters. Sir Derek Jacobi -- an actor who knows his way around the Bards cadences -- arrives at a theater to introduce a play about the matter. An amusing shift comes as the rudimentary gizmo that produces a rainstorm on stage gives way to the realism-invoking tricks of cinema. Thus begins a teasing ""The plays the thing. No the movies the thing"" tango. Emmerich and screenwriter John Orloff put forth the very modern notion that Shakespeares plays directly quoted from the goings-on in the royal court of England. So scenes from ""Hamlet"" ""Macbeth"" and Richard III"" provided clues to the inner-circle status of the works creator. Conversely De Vere is gobsmacked by audiences visceral response to the events unfolding onstage. Despite the subject ""Anonymous"" isnt a serious work of literary reckoning -- or cinematic art for that matter. Its not nearly as silly -- or tasty -- a bonbon as ""Shakespeare in Love."" Nor is it as intriguing a plunge into the Elizabethan era as Cate Blanchetts handsome vehicle ""Elizabeth"" (the first not its factually promiscuous sequel). Its cruel and lethal intrigue partakes of yet pales in comparison with the royal nastiness captured in Showtimes ""The Tudors."" Still there are enough vivid performances to keep those suspicious of the controversy from balking and those with no real horse in the race happy with the ""who-dun-wrote it?"" machinations. Vanessa Redgrave is a pleasure as the aged Elizabeth who has from the start taken an unseemly joy in theater. Joely Richardson Redgraves daughter portrays young Queen Elizabeth who finds her inner cougar as she seduces (and is seduced by) a younger Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower). For much of the film Ifans turn is a series of longing glances meant to telegraph the anguish and pleasure of a writer who hears his words find their audience and hit their mark -- only he cant take the bow. In the final act the performance blooms and the film finds its wounded truth in scenes between de Vere and Ben Jonson. This is Ifans doing but also Sebastian Armesto who portrays the playwright who has done his utmost to honor the Earls wish to keep his authorship mum. Alas ""Anonymous"" isnt merely intent on making the case for de Vere. It seems set on taking Will Shakespeare down too. Actor Rafe Spall happily obliges with a performance that cycles through cad and fop liar and extortionist and worse. Audiences may chuckle. Stratfordians prepare for conniptions.

What CGI calamity could he have in store? Another radioactive iguana running amuck? A super-blizzard? A magmic meltdown? No this time out Emmerich has set his talents toward loftier purposes. I will not be the first to say alas. Anonymous trudges forward with dull methodical urgency. Down at street level a man scrambles into the back door of a Broadway theater. He takes his place onstage in the nick of time still wearing his overcoat and muffler. The curtain rises and lo and behold Derek Jacobi silver-haired incarnation of the dramatic arts meticulously pedigreed Shakespearean. He speaks a brief prologue about the Bard upon whom he casts first praise and then suspicion. Could such noble words truly have been written by a man with only a grammar-school education? How can it be that not a single manuscript has ever been found written in Shakespeares own hand? ""Let me offer you a different story"" Jacobi continues ""a darker story."" Sadly ""darker"" in this instance seems essentially a synonym for ""dimmer."" Jacobi was doubtless chosen to deliver this introduction because he is a prominent enthusiast of the ""Oxfordian"" school of Shakespeare revisionism the theories of which supply the central plot of the film. In any case we dont see Jacobi again until the movies closing moments when his oddly untethered play-within-a-movie narrative frame (which is really a movie-within-a-play) abruptly reappears to underline the Oxfordian argument for anyone who might have nodded off during the intervening two hours. The argument in a nutshell is that Shakespeares plays and sonnets were in fact written by Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford and that Shakespeare himself was an illiterate actor who was credited with the works to protect de Veres lordly reputation. Though this is the most widespread alternative theory of Shakespearian authorship nowadays its not a terribly persuasive one as it depends on a variety of inferences and assumptions rather than any genuine forensic evidence. But Emmerich working from a script by John Orloff does the Oxfordian case no favors In his telling de Vere is a kind of 16th-century superhero poet and swordfighter nobleman and populist lover (and more) of Queen Elizabeth father of royal heirs and an heir himself. As such he is also a central figure in the machinations over who will succeed the queen and the target of various counterplots and assassination attempts. (I suppose we should be grateful that the film didnt have the time or ingenuity to also credit him with the works and deeds of Cervantes Caravaggio and Sir Francis Drake.) Take the political intrigue of Elizabeth add the backstage drama of Shakespeare in Love and divide by the adherence to fact and logic that propelled 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow and youll have a reasonable sense of what to expect from Anonymous. In the right hands this kind of broad historical reimagining can be rather fun whether it involves H.G. Wells chasing Jack the Ripper through time or Captain Nemo Allan Quatermain and Dr. Jekyll uniting to form a Victorian Justice League. But fun is an ingredient sorely missing from Emmerichs film. Rather than strive for the nimble literate whimsy of Shakespeare in Love Anonymous trudges forward with dull methodical urgency. More On Anonymous The Screenwriter for Anonymous Defends His Controversial Movie People Have Been Arguing About Shakespeare for Decades How to Turn Authors Into Film Subjects The Snobbiness of Oxfordians The film contains a great deal of convoluted and unnecessary chronological shuffling of ""40 years earlier""s tumbling on the heels of ""5 years earlier""s. But as best I could follow the idea is that de Vere first writes and performs a version of A Midsummer Nights Dream in the late 1550s or early 1560s when he is a prepubescent boy. A then-twentysomething Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) is delighted by the play and when he grows a bit older--perhaps his own late teens or early twenties--she takes de Vere (Jamie Campbell Bower) as a lover. Elizabeth becomes pregnant and gives birth to a noble child whose identity is long concealed from (but ultimately revealed to) both parents by the queens scheming adviser William Cecil (David Thewlis) and his equally scheming and villainously hunchbacked son Robert (Edward Hogg). Banished from court and forced into a loveless marriage de Vere spends a couple of decades secretly writing plays--Julius Caesar Macbeth Twelfth Night Romeo and Juliet--that sit untouched on his shelves until the 16th century is about to flip to the 17th. In hopes of influencing the royal succession de Vere (now played by Rhys Ifans) decides to have these works performed in public and approaches playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to put his name to them. But Jonson hesitates long enough that a boorish blackmailing and ultimately murderous actor named Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) decides to take credit himself. Complications and conspiracies both literary and geopolitical ensue. For all its silliness and self-regard Anonymous is ably executed and those who dont fret over its wildly ahistoric details may enjoy Anna Foersters brooding cinematography and a handful of nice performances. Ifans for his part exhibits a certain gloomy charisma in the central role of de Vere. (How very far hes come from the ""masturbating Welshman"" in a T-shirt that declares ""Youre the Most Beautiful Woman in the World; Fancy a Fuck?"") Richardson is customarily appealing as the young Elizabeth and her mother Vanessa Redgrave is better still as the aging often bewildered version--though its a pity that neither actress was given nearly as much to work with as Cate Blanchett Judi Dench and Helen Mirren in their recent tours as the Virgin Queen. But despite its solid cast fine sets and general air of quality Anonymous is in the end a load of nonsense a conspiratorial fantasy on a par with faked moon landings and Bill Ayers authorship of Barack Obamas autobiography. Late in the film while watching a production of Richard III one of Ben Jonsons playwright colleagues asks another ""How does it end?"" The reply ""Tragically no doubt."" No doubt.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides.

(AP Photo/Sony Columbia Pictures Reiner Bajo) <<12345>>Director Roland Emmerich loves to blow things up destroying the familiar and the iconic. He took out the White House and the Empire State Building with alien weaponry in ""Independence Day."" He took out the Statue of Liberty with an ice storm in ""The Day After Tomorrow."" And in ""2012"" he managed to unleash tidal waves on just about everything from the Egyptian pyramids to the statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro.So whats Emmerichs target in his new film ""Anonymous""? That would be William Shakespeare the greatest playwright in the English language with Queen Elizabeth I as collateral damage. For Emmerich the master of cinematic disaster this costume drama set in Elizabethan London amounts to a change of pace -- even though he tosses in a spectacular fire at the citys Globe Theatre just to keep his hand in it.

Puss in Boots Puss in Boots 3D Puss in Boots IMAX The Rum Diary The Skin I Live In Interviews with the stars hot new trailers At the heart of ""Anonymous"" is the long debate over just who wrote the 37 plays and 154 sonnets written by Shakespeare. At times the work has been credited to fellow playwrights Christopher Marlowe and Benjamin Jonson (both who figure in the film) Francis Bacon and Elizabeth herself.But Emmerich and John Orloff (""A Mighty Heart"") who wrote the intellectually flabby script subscribe to the ""Oxfordian theory"" which holds that Shakespeare was barely able to read and the real writer was Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford. To juice things up Emmerich and Orloff throw in all manner of palace intrigue a real-life attempt to overthrow those around Elizabeth and something called the ""Prince Tudor Theory Part II"" (which suggests the Earl of Oxford was the incestuous lover of Elizabeth among other things).Advertisement Everybody or so it seems has a secret and its almost as if the London of the time was the Wisteria Lane of the early 17th century.It all might be truly great fun if it werent so riddled with inaccuracies and bizarre moments which will leave anyone with a passing knowledge of Shakespeare and his time scratching their head. This Swiss cheese version of Elizabethan history gets all manner of things small and large wrong ranging from the notion from de Vere allegedly wrote ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"" and performed it for Elizabeth at the age of 9 to the timing of the revolt led by the earls of Sussex and South Hampton. And that doesnt even get into the anachronisms. When Shakespeare crowd-surfs through a theater audience after a particularly notable triumph its a giggle-inducing moment.Down through the ages storytellers (the Bard included) have tweaked history to serve their dramatic ends. But ""Anonymous"" is an outright mugging of historical fact.All that said Emmerich is a director with some not inconsiderable skills. He is terrific at big set pieces and he knows how to make a movie visually compelling. (His digitally created London is striking.) And while his most recent work has been bloated (see ""2012"") he has shown at times he can bring brisk pacing to a film and does so again in the dialogue-heavy ""Anonymous.""Emmerich has also very wisely called upon some of the United Kingdoms better actors to carry the weight. Rhys Ifans (""Harry Potter"") commands your attention as de Vere bringing considerable gravitas to the role. Vanessa Redgrave injects a fair amount of nuance into her role as Elizabeth in her dotage. Her daughter Joely Richardson is splendid as the queen in her younger more lusty days. David Thewlis is grandly manipulative as William Cecil the queens closest adviser and Edward Hogg is appropriately nasty as his son Robert who the film would have as the model for the title character in Shakespeares ""Richard III."" And Rafe Sprall (""Shaun of the Dead"") makes more of the drunken illiterate Shakespeare than is in the script giving him some nasty edges.Oh and its pretty grand to watch the great Shakespearean actors Derek Jacobi (in the modern-day scenes that open and close the film) and Mark Rylance bring the writers words to life. (You really want to see more of Rylance playing Richard III.)But in the end the best you can say about ""Anonymous"" is that its something Shakespeare himself knew well -- an ""entertainment"" more diverting than engaging. If you are looking for something more intellectual and certainly more accurate in its portrayal of a rich period in English history you will have to go elsewhere.Anonymous   Rating PG-13 (for sexual content and violence)Cast Rhys Ifans Vanessa Redgrave David Thewlis Joely Richardson and Derek JacobiDirector Roland EmmerichRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 28 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Oct. 16 2013 110PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Roland Emmerich Written by John Orloff Starring Rhys Ifans Vanessa Redgrave Joely Richardson Rafe Spall David Thewlis Classification 14A Year 2011 Country U.K. Germany USA Language English The less you know about Shakespeare the more youre likely to enjoy Anonymous a speculative costume drama that posits the Bard as an illiterate bumpkin the Virgin Queen as guilty of false advertising and almost everything that happened in the Elizabethan Age as a needlessly convoluted conspiracy to fool future generations. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Anonymous"" Movies Anonymous The official trailer Originally written a dozen years ago John Orloffs screenplay was shelved after another mock Tudor script co-written by Tom Stoppard became the Oscar-winning comedy Shakespeare in Love. While that script was wittily irreverent about its historical conjecture Anonymous takes its absurdities seriously. The movie is essentially an earnest illustration of the cockamamie theory that Shakespeares works were ghost written by Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford though the literary scam barely scratches the surface of a muddle of political intrigues blackmail incest and murder.We begin in contemporary Manhattan where Sir Derek Jacobi walks out onto a Broadway stage to introduce a play that promises to tell the real story behind Shakespeares works. After yet another prologue in which the playwright Ben Jonson is being tortured to reveal the true secrets of who wrote Shakespeares plays we jump back in time again to the films main story. Edward de Vere (Rhys Ifans) a world-weary impoverished aristocrat is looking back on his life and the intrigues surrounding Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave).In flashbacks we see the young de Vere as a literary prodigy (he writes and stages A Midsummer Nights Dream at age nine) who is raised by the puritanical royal adviser Robert Cecil (David Thewlis). When young de Vere kills a servant whos hiding behind a curtain (an event later recycled in ""his"" play Hamlet) the conniving Cecil blackmails the young Earl into marrying his daughter and giving up literature. Married or not the young Earl (Jamie Campbell Bower) becomes the lover to the randy young Elizabeth (Redgraves daughter Joely Richardson) until a falling-out sees him banished from the court.Years later the middle-aged de Vere (Ifans again) attends one of those newfangled popular plays and instantly recognizes the form as a vehicle for propaganda to counter the court influence of Cecil and his creepy son (Edward Hogg). De Vere secretly contacts playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to stage de Veres play under Jonsons name but the scrupulous author declines. Instead a buffoonish illiterate hack actor Will Shakespeare ( Shaun of the Deads Rafe Spall) jumps at the opportunity and becomes de Veres improbably clownish front man.In an unintentional irony Shakespeare (as played by Spall) very nearly manages to steal the drama after all providing the movies few moments of comic relief as the fake Bard. When the crowd calls ""Author"" he comes to the front of the stage and babbles like an inarticulate award-show winner and even surfs across the arms of the groundlings like a rock star.Apart from these few light moments Anonymous is a case of ingenuity wasted on an unintelligent enterprise All the elegant costumes and exposition-filled dialogue in shadowy candle-lit rooms is to justify the snobbish claim that a humble glovemakers son couldnt possibly outwrite his better-educated blue-blood peers.Some compensation is provided by a flawless English cast which adds substance to the theory. Vanessa Redgrave provides an especially vivid turn as the frail tempestuous old Queen hiding her discoloured teeth behind a gloved hand.Also noteworthy is this odd career departure for blockbuster maker Roland Emmerich ( 2012 Independence Day). Though his directing is utterly conventional he does a fine job with CGI models and sets to recreate the world of London of four centuries ago. That includes the legendary ""wooden O"" of the Globe Theatre where we watch fragments of the plays though with scenes oddly out of order still working their magic. What an amazing special effect A actor on a bare wooden stage using nothing but a sequence of words that make your scalp prickle.

Unlikely to follow the mystifying Oscar triumph of ""Shakespeare in Love Roland Emmerichs ""Anonymous insists that no William Shakespeare was not a cute young writer inspired to write ""Romeo and Juliet by a cross-dressing Gwyneth Paltrow. In this telling Shakespeare is a buffoonish illiterate actor who lends his name to plays written by Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford. The latter cannot accept credit for some of the greatest works in the English language because of convoluted political and family reasons. Despite the presence of such noted Shakespearean actors as Derek Jacobi (who appears in a modern-day prologue) and Mark Rylance (former director of the modern Globe Theatre) as an actor at the old Globe ""Anonymous is really no more convincing than ""Shakespeare in Love. Surprisingly this isnt primarily the fault of director Emmerich the disaster-movie specialist who gave us such blockbusters as ""Independence Day and ""2012. Like those films ""Anonymous is a thoroughly entertaining load of eye candy with solid performances even if John Orloffs exposition-heavy script practically requires a concordance to follow at times. The action toggles confusingly back and forth between several time periods. Mostly it takes place in the years before the 54-year-old Earl of Oxfords execution for sedition in 1604 when he is splendidly played by veteran character actor Rhys Ifans. (Jamie Campbell Bower plays Oxford as a young man.) Oxford has been secretly writing plays for decades despite a promise to cool it extracted by William Cecil (David Thewlis) the overbearing nobleman who raised him and later became his father-in-law. But Oxford digs out his work when he learns that William and his son Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg) -- top advisers to Queen Elizabeth I (a wonderful Vanessa Redgrave) -- have become involved in the intrigues surrounding a successor to the aging monarch who has no acknowledged children. Our hero goes looking for a front but playwrights Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe -- two leading suspects as the Bard through the centuries -- dont want to risk their own reputations. So the clownish and uneducated Shakespeare (Rafe Spall son of Timothy) steps forward and takes credit for Oxfords popular plays much to Oxfords horror. This arouses the suspicions of the hunchbacked Robert Cecil who rightly takes ""Richard III as a satiric commentary on his own lust for the throne. This plotting involving one of the queens numerous lovers the Earl of Essex is not easy to follow -- particularly when the film keeps cutting back to Oxfords youth when we see his dalliance with the young Elizabeth (played by Redgraves real-life daughter Joely Richardson). Where ""Anonymous has it all over ""Shakespeare in Love is its detailed evocation of London from four centuries ago. The rowdy audience for Shakespeares first works at the Globe Theatre is especially colorful. Toward the end Orloffs script stops to wonder what might happen if Elizabeth absentmindedly slept with one -- or more -- of the many illegitimate children she supposedly gave away as a randy young queen. Before heading off to the gallows Oxford conveniently provides Shakespeare with a supply of plays to publish after Oxfords death. Under the circumstances its fair to wonder if he also left behind a treatment for ""Chinatown.

Starring Xavier Samuel Rhys Ifans Jamie Campbell Bower Vanessa Redgrave David Thewlis Joely Richardson Rafe Spall Derek Jacobi Tom Wlaschiha Edward Hogg Director Roland Emmerich Running time 210 Release Opened Oct 28 2011  Editorial Review A literary conspiracyBy Ann HornadayFriday Oct 28 2011Remember ""Shakespeare in Love""? With ""Anonymous"" director Roland Emmerich gives us ""Shakespeare in Luck."" Make that ""Dumb Luck"" In this alternately entertaining and wildly ham-handed speculative romp Emmerich and screenwriter John Orloff advance the notion that William Shakespeare was a fraud and that Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford actually wrote those famous plays and poems his Puritan upbringing and noble station preventing him from dabbling publicly in such ink-stained enterprises. The adherents of that theory known as Oxfordians have found an energetic advocate in Emmerich (best known for such ballistic action pictures as ""2012"" and ""Independence Day"") who has made ""Anonymous"" a sort of ""JFK"" for the 16th-century literary fringe. Here the Umbrella Man and the Babushka Lady are replaced by such figures as Ben Jonson and Queen Elizabeth I who witness - wittingly or not - what the movie presents as a political and artistic scandal of Shakesp - er Oxfordian proportions. Whether viewers buy its hypothesis ""Anonymous"" delivers a reasonably vivacious tale of palace intrigue backstage catfighting and bodice-ripping lust. Rhys Ifans - so often pigeonholed in scruffy goofball roles - here delivers an unexpectedly soulful performance as Edward de Vere a sad-eyed figure of thwarted passion who first calls upon Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to be his amanuensis. When a mix-up results in an actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) putting his name on de Veres first play the fix is in. The vain drunken Shakespeare proceeds to hog all the credit while de Vere desperately pens thinly veiled allegories in order to prevent the succession of Scotlands King James to the English throne. (In my college days a class called History of the Tudors and Stuarts was nicknamed ""Tuds and Studs""; in ""Anonymous"" the Tuds are the studs.) While de Vere covertly propagandizes Queen Elizabeth still reigns supreme - and as embodied by the exquisite high-spirited Vanessa Redgrave she shows no signs of fading. If Oxfordians come to ""Anonymous"" finally to see their version of history validated garden-variety filmgoers will find their reward in Redgrave whose performance brims with intelligence sensuality and witty alert spontaneity. (In a clever bit of casting Emmerich has enlisted Redgraves real-life daughter Joely Richardson as the younger Elizabeth.) Emmerich engages in some equally arresting pieces of stagecraft including a wonderfully inventive opening sequence in which the actor Derek Jacobi literally sets the stage for the story; later during the first performance of ""Henry V"" the crowd surges forward during the St. Crispins Day speech to battle the French themselves an early instance of user-generated content. But what first promises to be an intriguing if loony divertissement eventually succumbs to outrageousness for its own sake taking the notion of ""band of brothers"" to new levels insistently slandering Shakespeare as a dim alcoholic lout and sending de Veres relationship with Queen Elizabeth into the gratuitously tawdry outer reaches. That ""Anonymous"" takes its premise so far should prove a comfort to Shakespeares champions who have preempted the Oxfordian argument with the swift resolve of the Warren Commission Reports most full-throated defenders post-""JFK."" The filmmakers finally treat viewers to a climax every bit as hyperbolic as the melodrama in a scene of computer-generated carnage and firepower that wouldnt look out of place in ""Independence Day."" Dont let the frilly costumes courtly language and historical pretense fool you ""Anonymous"" is still a Roland Emmerich movie - a blessing when it comes to vigor and a curse when it comes to subtlety proportion or sense.Contains violence and sexual content.

Director Roland Emmerichs latest may be as logic-based as Independence Day but never doubt his ability to stage a spectacle.This time he uses his CGI toolkit to conjure grimy 16th-century London complete with teeming streets and dingy alehouses. Its not all computerized either Cinematographer Anna Foerster works wonders with natural lighting and HD digital video. Anonymous is one handsome movie.Its also flat-out bonkers and if you can get past the forced pretzel logic of its premise -- Queen Elizabeth (a magnificent Vanessa Redgrave with help from her daughter Joely Richardson as the young queen) slept around Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) was an illiterate buffoon -- the lunacy comes off with florid conviction. Rhys Ifans certainly seems to be enjoying himself. He plays the Earl of Oxford posited here and in other quarters as the author of Shakespeares work as a kind of tragically fey rock star done in by scheming court tyrants. Edward Hogg practically leaves a trail of slime as Sir Robert Cecil Oxfords prime nemesis.Anonymous is essentially a lighter weight JFK for the Elizabethan crowd. Its a little confusing meticulously crafted and plotted with a baroque gusto that defeats any claims it might otherwise have to legitimacy. Thats the thing about conspiracy theories. Theyre generally too elaborate and improbable to be taken seriously. That doesnt mean they cant be fun.AnonymousB-Starring Rhys Ifans Vanessa Redgrave Sebastian Armesto Rafe Spall David Thewlis Edward Hogg and Joely Richardson. Directed by Roland Emmerich.

Sounds like the stuff of an academic thesis. Surprise Anonymous is the latest epic from Roland Emmerich the director who gets off on blowing stuff up in world-enders such as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. Its only plausibility that goes up in flames this time. Say this for Emmerich hes not stuffy. And he lucks out big-time with his cast. Welsh actor Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill) plays Oxford with such fire and nobility you can almost believe he was the author of the Bards timeless plays and sonnets. Disgrace to the royal line would follow if Oxford put his own name on his work so rather than go with the trite Anonymous he first considers hiring playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) as his surrogate. Failing that he signs on with Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall - all ham on wry) an illiterate comic actor. And then Queen Elizabeth gets into the act. Played in her youth by a live-wire Joely Richardson and later by her mother a glorious Vanessa Redgrave the virgin queen takes more than Oxfords manuscripts to bed.

"Anonymous Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-William ShakespeareMovie review AnonymousThe film with Rhys Ifans as Edward de Vere the films purported bard behind Shakespeare is no classic but its fun.October 28 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Joely Richardson and Jamie Campbell Bower in ""Anonymous."" (Reiner Bajo / Columbia TriStar )""Anonymous"" a starring a sizable swath of Britains resident acting class a is an ambitiously biting (gnawing?) literary whodunit turning on the Shakespeare question. As in who really wrote all those seminal plays and sonnets a long-running scholarly debate that (unlike the actual author) apparently will never die. That might sound like costume drama taken to deadly boring academic extremes. But surprisingly in director Roland Emmerichs usually effects-heavy hands (""Independence Day"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and oh so many more) we have something closer to a fanciful commedia dellarte. Its Shakespeare as B-movie if you will or to borrow from the bard a boffo blast which Im pretty sure is from either ""King Lear"" or ""Hamlet."" There are palace intrigues beddings and beheadings and lots of well-staged theater. Rhys Ifans turns out to be the best surprise of all a excellent as the eminence of pathos the 17th Earl of Oxford who (in this telling) wielded ""the"" mighty pen and had the ink-stained hands to prove it. Screenwriter John Orloff (""A Mighty Heart"") doesnt do half bad himself. ""William Shakespeare"" a whoever he was a I think would probably be at least a little amused by ""Anonymous."" For amusing it is a along with bawdy brazen politically outrageous plausible enough and occasionally graced with something close to Shakespearean cleverness in an absurdist sort of way. To set things up the film opens as if were watching a current production in Londons West End an actor on stage in a single spotlight setting up the Shakespeare mythology. It quickly dissolves into Shakespeares time richly rendered from the pomp and ceremony of the royal court to the mud and muck of 16th century London. As imagined in ""Anonymous"" William Shakespeare was an illiterate actor barely able to write his name much less a sonnet and an opportunist with an outsized ego all of which actor Rafe Spall (""Shaun of the Dead"" ""Hot Fuzz"") handles nicely. The real playwright and poet was Edward De Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford who for complicated reasons needs a front man for his work. De Vere is played with great aplomb by Ifans unrecognizable from his naked ""Notting Hill"" days in fact unrecognizable from anything hes ever done. Let us just point out that he does Elizabethan aristocracy very well indeed. A noted writing contemporary of Shakespeares Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto excellent in his creative frustration) is the man De Vere ultimately entrusts with his plays and with carrying out what really is a if it is a one of the greatest ruses ever. For all the royal betrayals one of the rather delicious subtexts is that fights between writers for literary supremacy are just as deadly as struggles for the crown. In a neat bit of symmetry Vanessa Redgrave plays Queen Elizabeth I in her waning days and Redgraves daughter Joely Richardson plays the monarch in her lusty younger years a in this telling ""the Virgin Queen"" is so in name only. The queens confidant William Cecil (David Thewlis) and later his nefarious hunchback son Robert (Edward Hogg) are De Veres nemeses both bristling with disdain for the Lord Oxfords various obsessions. There are many more earls and lads and ladies in waiting in this sprawling cast. There is a crown in the offing for someone if they can just keep their heads about them. And overriding it all is the anonymous bard a writing what he sees writing what he fears and putting it out there as fast as he can to inflame and inform the masses. If the filmmakers have done nothing else they have turned ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" from mere axiom into action hero. One of the films great pleasures is the way in which Orloff uses fragments of Shakespeares plays to fit the moment and mood of the time a its all ripped-from-the-headlines stuff. This is where Emmerichs special-effects history pays off smartly too. London a from its world of theater to its class divides a comes to life exquisitely on screen (so hats off to the production/costume crews). Beyond the filmmakers attention to detail its interesting to watch snippets of the plays a so literate and lofty and set inside a world theoretically known only to members of the royal court (thus how could Shakespeare have written Shakespeare?) a completely understood and embraced by those unwashed masses. Which raises the questiona|. Because the film keeps picking up threads of so many of its characters from childhood adulthood and later years; because the palace intrigues are so complex; and because lets face it this is not Shakespeare ""Anonymous"" occasionally comes apart at the seams. But amusing and diverting it is and on any given day amusing and diverting is enough. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCalifornia Like England?

This wise and beautiful little film is about two lovers falling from a state of grace. Watch a clip of Paramounts ""Like Crazy."" The outward impediment to their romance is a bureaucratic tangle. Anna (Felicity Jones) a vivacious young Englishwoman in her senior year at a California college falls in love with Jacob (Anton Yelchin) a touchingly tender young American whos been studying furniture design. After graduation she overstays her student visa by a couple of months to spend the summer with him. After a quick trip home to visit her parents Anna returns to California where U.S. immigration officials discover her visa violation refuse her entry and put her on the next flight back to London. At a time when illegal immigration is a hot-button topic Annas troubles might seem trivial. But her offense and the complicated long-distance relationship that ensues are only pretexts for a heartbreaking study of passionate love that deprived of proximity turn into confusion little lies on both sides then bigger lies and worst of all self-betrayal. ENLARGE Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones in Like Crazy. Paramount Vantage ""Like Crazy"" was directed by Drake Doremus who wrote the script with Ben York Jones. Yet the written words arent necessarily the ones that come out of the actors mouths since most of the dialogue was improvised. I didnt realize that going in. I try to know as little as possible about a given film in advance of seeing it and this one undercut my conviction that actors improvisations lead more often than not to spontaneous banality. (My assumption about John Guleserians beautiful cinematography was similarly upset. I would have bet that hed shot on 35mm film. In fact he used the video function of a Canon EOS 7D a digital still camera that sells on the consumer market for about 1500 plus lenses and often travels on vacationers necks.) Ms. Jones and Mr. Yelchin are spontaneous all right. So too are Jennifer Lawrence as Jacobs fallback girlfriend (though I wish shed had a more substantial role) and Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead as Annas parents. But Anna and Jacob are also eloquent in their respective ways--Ms. Jones with her very English verbal fluency Mr. Yelchin with his very American syntactic vagueness--and all the more so in the silence of their expressions. Seldom has a script found such resonance in its lovers eyes body language and inward gazes. At one point in their relationship with Anna stuck in England while the U.S. Embassy reviews her case Jacob gives her a silver bracelet engraved with one word Patience. The same advice applies to moviegoers. ""Like Crazy"" develops slowly and threatens at first to be just another movie about beautiful young people in the Age of Fraught Relationships. Its much more than that though. Without belaboring any issues it speaks volumes about fear of commitment--Annas father offers the cheerfully old-fashioned suggestion that she and Jacob solve her visa problem by getting married--about inconstancy in any age about anxiety bred of mendacity about the dangers as well as the pleasures of impulsivity and the mystery of what if anything a pledge of love means. Patience pays off at least for us. Watch a film clip of director Chris Millers new animation movie ""Puss in Boots"" starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. Clip Courtesy of DreamWorks. Puss in Boots Dont think of this charming 3-D animated feature as a spin-off from ""Shrek"" so much as a lift-off for the swashbuckling feline voiced by Antonio Banderas. Puss made his debut in ""Shrek 2"" then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now hes got a movie of his own and not a moment too soon. ""Puss in Boots"" exults in extravagant images while Mr. Banderas makes its hero--""Poos"" as his name is pronounced by most of the Spanish-accented characters--a paragon of sophisticated wit. You cant help but smile at his first Zorro-esque line accompanied by a guitar strum ""Through the years I have been known by many names."" And you sense a bright comic imagination at work when he bellies up to a bar orders milk and purrs ""I am but a humble gato looking for his next meal."" ENLARGE The titular feline swashbuckler in Puss in Boots. DreamWorks Animation A dramatic imagination is another story. The plot is little more than a string of collisions and events with a Tom-and-Jerry flavor that gets seriously diluted over the course of 90 minutes. Puss teams up with Humpty Dumpty (a creepily epicene ovoid voiced with eerie plaintiveness by Zach Galifianakis) to repay an old debt by stealing some magic beans from Jack and Jill. Along the way they climb a beanstalk that looks like a sky-scraping strand of DNA encounter a baby goose noticeably smaller than the golden eggs it lays a mother goose with the dimensions and disposition of King Kong and Kitty Softpaws a sexy cat burglar--that is to say a cat who burgles preferably by picking pockets-- played by Salma Hayek. When Puss and Kitty meet they throw themselves into a showstopper of a flamenco dance fight and do an equally effective reprise awhile later. But it isnt quite correct to say they stop the show which constantly functions in fits and starts--appealing set pieces inspired displays of animation (almost too much of too many brilliant things) and above all a performance by Mr. Banderas that defines the essence of droll. His voice is the gatos meow. Anonymous Watch a clip of Roland Emmerichs political thriller ""Anonymous"". Video courtesy of Sony/Columbia. Roland Emmerich has all but ended the world in such action spectaculars as ""Independence Day"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012."" In ""Anonymous"" he extinguishes literary scholarship by contending that Shakespeares plays were written by Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford. So all right then thats taken care of. Edward (played by Rhys Ifans) is the man we should have been honoring all along and Will Shakespeare an amiable buffoon as well as an indifferent actor took credit where it wasnt due. One problem with ""Anonymous"" though is what it says about the writers trade. Shakespeare--I mean Edward--is an unhappy man. ""The voices"" he cries. ""I cant stop them I would go mad if I didnt write down the voices."" He gets no sympathy from his wife. ""My God"" she says with disgust ""youre writing again."" And toward the end of his life he muses glumly ""Words merely words will be my sole legacy."" Didnt he even have fun writing his comedies? ENLARGE Rhys Ifans in Anonymous. Columbia Pictures A bigger problem with ""Anonymous"" is its opacity. The nonsensical notion of Edwards authorship is hardly more than a subplot. (He decided to hide it according to John Orloffs screenplay--which was actually written by whom?--out of fear that his plays were dangerously critical of powerful figures in Queen Elizabeths court.) Most of the movie is devoted to the Essex Rebellion against the queen and the action hops back and forth in time so befuddlingly with the same set of characters played by different actors that I defy anyone who isnt a scholar of the period to understand whats going on. (Which is not to suggest that I did.) Joely Richardson is engaging as the young queen but her mother Vanessa Redgrave is something else as Queen Bess in her powdered dotage. That something varies from moment to moment scene to scene. Sometimes shes distracted to the point of dottiness sometimes shes sharp as a tack and still seductive. In a movie that rings false at every turn Ms. Redgraves Elizabeth is truly and infallibly regal. In Time Andrew Niccols ""In Time"" looks great sounds stilted and plays like a clever videogame with too many rules. The premise builds on the notion that time is money. In the movies dystopian future where todays cars have tomorrows grilles time has replaced money. People are born with genetic clocks that stop at the age of 25; after that theyve got one year in which to beg borrow steal or even earn more time. If they dont the digital clocks embedded in their forearms dwindle down to zero and they time out i.e. die. Thats clever right? But then there are roving gangs called Minute Men (Teddy Boy types out of ""A Clockwork Orange"") who steal time; the borderline-silly spectacle of almost everyone looking 25; the polemic element of social injustice (the richest of the rich can live forever because theyve got eons socked away); and the action-adventure element a clumsy amalgam of Robin Hood ""Bonnie and Clyde"" ""The Avengers"" ""Les Miserables"" ""Dick Tracy"" (for the color and graphics) and Mr. Niccols earlier and impressive genetic-engineering opus ""Gattaca."" Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake are the Bonnie and Clyde stand-ins though Ms. Seyfrieds makeup and wig suggest Anna Karina in an old Godard film. Its hard to judge their performances since they were clearly encouraged to be as stylized as the photography and sets by a director who given the evidence on screen came up short in the department of humor and was tone deaf to their American accents. (The English Minute Men sound fine.) It couldnt be easier on the other hand to judge Roger Deakinss cinematography Alex McDowells production design or Colleen Atwoods costumes; theyre all top-notch. Still one question lingers. In a film shot in and around Los Angeles why do all the car chases through all of the fictional regions time zones look like they were staged on the same venerable bridge across the Los Angeles River? ENLARGE Charlie Bartlett (2007) Charlie is a precocious young high-school student who both pops and pushes pills and Anton Yelchin plays him as a rich overmedicated Candide. The kids stash of the stuff is so copious thanks to an indulgent psychiatrist that he starts sharing it with his schoolmates and dispensing therapy along with the pills in the boys room. The cast includes Hope Davis at her best as Charlies libidinous mother Robert Downey Jr. as the schools bibulous principal and Kat Dennings as his daughter. Jon Poll directed from a script by Gustin Nash. The cinematographer was the estimable Paul Sarossy. Shakespeare in Love (1998) The Earl of Oxford may have written this too but Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard got screen credit for what is by unanimous agreement among Shakespearean scholars a totally fictional account of how a Bard with writers block sought help from a shrink (who timed patients sessions with an hourglass) and churned out ""Romeo and Juliet"" only after discovering his muse in a dishy brainy aristocrat named Lady Viola. Joseph Fiennes is Will Gwyneth Paltrow is Viola Geoffrey Rush is Philip Henslowe Shakespeares frantic gap-toothed producer and Judi Dench is the formidable Queen Elizabeth. The director was John Madden. Letters to Juliet (2010) Im not in love with this confection but I couldnt resist its intersections with ""Anonymous"" and ""In Time"" too. Amanda Seyfrieds Sophie a New Yorker magazine fact-checker goes to Verona to join volunteers who answer a ceaseless stream of letters addressed to Juliet. (The letter part is true.) She uncovers one written by an ardent English girl who is now a septuagenarian played by Vanessa Redgrave. And played so wonderfully well that watching her in action is like sitting in on a master class. Gary Winick directed from a cloying script by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan.

According to Anonymous an airless bilious endless pageant of pseudohistory it was Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford who hired playwright Ben Jonson to circulate the earls unsigned plays to producers when an upstart actor named William Shakespeare claimed credit for them. More about Anonymous >> The film is the work of Roland Emmerich himself no stranger to speculative fiction. See his 2012 which asks ""Will the world end in earthquakes tsunami or volcanic eruptions - or all simultaneously?"" Or Stargate which asks ""What if ancient Egyptians populated a desert planet reachable only via cheesy special-effects?"" Anonymous is no more or less far-fetched than Emmerichs prior efforts. But it is much much more confusing. Its flashbacks have flashbacks. Its characters are shrill and misanthropic. Its hero (a suave Rhys Ifans resembling Peter OToole in his Henry II period of the mid-1960s) is a man of words not swords something he reminds the audience multiple times. Most lethally the evidence Anonymous offers for de Vere as the real Shakespeare is as flimsy as Oliver Stones implication in JFK that Lyndon Johnson conspired in a coup detat to unseat President John F. Kennedy. Political comparisons are apt as the basis of Anonymous written by John Orloff is that de Vere aimed to use his dramas to rouse the rabble and raise his illegitimate son to be Queen Elizabeths successor. Like many Shakespeare plays the pretext of Anonymous is royal succession. Who shall succeed Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave)? Will it be James of Scotland son of Elizabeths cousin and political rival Mary Queen of Scots or the Earl of Southampton Oxfords illegitimate son? In place of the explosions and special effects of a typical Emmerich movie Anonymous provides rant and cant. He presents Queen Elizabeth (Redgrave in the present day and Joely Richardson her real-life daughter in flashbacks) as a vain flibbertigibbet easily manipulated by her nefarious adviser William Cecil (David Thewlis who all but twirls his mustache when he steers the queen into believing his ideas are her own). Well you argue wasnt Shakespeare in Love a speculative yarn about how Romeo and Juliet came to be written? And if so why not extend similar goodwill toward Anonymous? Indeed Shakespeare in Love is a spirited work of fan fiction. Anonymous however is a dispiriting dropping of a boo-bird. It treats Shakespeares plays not as works of the heart but as gambits on the political chessboard. It does provide an accidental moment of humor When Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) is cheered by the rabble at a curtain call of Henry III he is pulled off stage and through the audience on the shoulders of groundlings.

But desperate to be heard de Vere angles for the prison release of a commoner and his dramaturgical contemporary the satirist Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) whom he backs into a plot to get his plays staged. The works need a public face and in a bit of comic happenstance that face winds up belonging to a deviled ham in Jonsons troupe named William Shakespeare whos played with exuberant dashes of paprika by Rafe Spall.Meanwhile de Vere continues to struggle with the forbidding Lord William Cecil (David Thewlis) a trusted adviser to Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in flashbacks her daughter Joely Richardson). Cecil banned Edward from writing poems and plays because they promoted the sinful worship of false idols. Cecils greed is another matter. He forces de Vere to marry his daughter in order to get at his fortune. But de Vere had already been thoroughly seduced by the queen. The news of the affair only drives Lord William closer to becoming Lord Voldemort.Yes ""Anonymous is about 15 movies at least 11 of which weve seen before several of which I havent even mentioned. The moviemaking is proficient if unremarkable. I like the idea of an Elizabethan action movie apparently more than I enjoy watching one. It is fun watching Redgrave whos almost as exciting as Spall is don the red curls and powdered face while flapping her hands feigning dottiness and being a touch randy. So this is what awaits Cate Blanchetts steely monarch a stint on ""Golden Girls.The trouble with what Emmerich and the screenwriter John Orloff have done has nothing to do with its revisionism. Everything about Shakespeare is open to interpretation. Among certain scholars that includes his very authorship. But Emmerich appears to be reaching for great dramatic heights despite having extremely short arms which he uses instead to swing bombastically at his point.The gist of ""Anonymous is as plausible as any conspiracy theory formed by gaps in the historical record. Emmerich of course is so delighted to expose Shakespeare as a hack and a fraud that it feels like the work of a sleazy lawyer throwing the book at a corpse.The participation of Redgrave Thewlis and in small parts Derek Jacobi and Mark Rylance only seems to inflame Emmerichs comical egotism See they agree For us its incongruous like putting filet mignon in a Quarter Pounder With Cheese. Its also possible that Emmerich simply identified with being incapable of producing art and gathered strength from working with actors who know from Shakespeare. Regardless ""Anonymous is trash that reminds us its disaster-obsessed maker is what Jonson might have called a poetaster. Emmerich is a camp artist someone who doesnt know his work is ridiculous which at times is a backhanded hoot for us.

Not that the authorship of the greatest plays and poems in the history of the English language is without interest. Its just that the new film painting Shakespeare as a fraud is so disappointingly dopey that its unworthy of anyones time. The premise of the film is that Shakespeare was an illiterate oaf whose entire body of work was ghostwritten by Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford as coded political attacks on his rivals in the Elizabethan court. ""Anonymous"" snobbishly argues that an uneducated yokel could never have written so radiantly. By such reasoning Lincoln must have stolen the Gettysburg Address. ""Anonymous"" comes to us from Roland Emmerich who has already made a movie in which the Revolutionary War was fought with semiautomatic muskets and another about the aliens who built the pyramids. Later Emmerich revised his stance with a movie about cavemen building the pyramids with domesticated mammoths. ""Anonymous"" boasts the same level of scholarship. Shakespeare staged plays well in advance of De Veres court intrigues. The aristocrat died before the real-life shipwreck that inspired ""The Tempest."" Shakespeare released five plays written with collaborators following De Veres death. But so what? In this version of history Queen Elizabeth I was no virgin She had so many illegitimate babies that she lost track forgetfully taking one adult love child back into the royal bedchamber as an incestuous consort. Thank goodness Emmerich didnt include time travelers who built Stonehenge. If you can ignore the factual errors and the looney-tunes theories the film has its moments. The production design is striking from Londons grimy pubs and muck-slick streets to breathtaking palaces. Rafe Spall (""Hot Fuzz"") makes Shakespeare an entertainingly thick-witted opportunist who revels in his fame with the first stage-dive in recorded history. As De Vere Rhys Ifans is all heavy-lidded romantic suffering fully engaged with life only when he can sneak into a box at the Globe Theatre to mouth ""his"" lines along with the cast. But the acting honors must go to the mother-and-daughter acting team of Vanessa Redgrave as the older Elizabeth and Joely Richardson as the younger queen. Its two fine actresses in a single seamless performance. What a shame their good work is trapped in a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Anonymous Great Director Roland Emmerich. Cast Rhys Ifans Vanessa Redgrave David Thewlis. Rating PG-13 for some violence and sexual content. Sounds like a trick question but as fans of the Bard know its not. Whether William Shakespeare is solely responsible for the finest works written in the English language has been a topic of debate practically since the ink on his pen dried. Scholars have turned the authorship into a cottage industry with debates ranging from the intriguing to the silly. Now Roland Emmerich has made a movie that both puts forth an answer and better still is tremendously entertaining. This is the same Roland Emmerich who directed such films as ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but far from being a special-effects-laden dopey blockbuster its a period piece that gives the credit to the Earl of Oxford. Historians will quibble with the timing and accuracy of a lot of the film and you know what? Let them. The rest of us can enjoy the performances and the sumptuous look of the movie which is a lot more satisfying anyway. In this telling Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto) -- another frequent suspect of authorship -- is tortured by thugs of the state who want to know if Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans) wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare. Its a matter of importance to Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg) the hunchbacked adviser to Queen Elizabeth (played as the older queen by Vanessa Redgrave and as a younger woman by Redgraves real-life daughter Joely Richardson) which may sound like a stretch but it works. Cecil like his father William (David Thewlis) before him is an uptight Puritan and considers plays and poetry sinful the devils work. This puts him at odds with his boss -- Elizabeth is shown to be a great admirer of the arts from an early age. But she doesnt interfere with the Cecils stand. The plays in particular have gained great popularity in London with their obvious political overtones. Robert Cecil is for instance enraged not that ""Shakespeare"" has written a play about Richard III that casts him as a villain abusing his power to the detriment of the people but that he has made the character a hunchback. Oxford originally wanted Johnson to take credit for his writing -- Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) is an illiterate womanizing drunken actor and it is beyond credulity that such a cretin could pen such beautiful works. He cant even write his own name. But his signature ends up on a manuscript and the rest is at least one version of history. This is set against a backdrop of more obvious political intrigue with Essex (Sam Reid) and Southampton (Xavier Samuel) plotting a coup that proves disastrous. And there is another subplot involving the bastard children of the ""virgin"" queen. All of this ties together sort of in John Orloffs screenplay but its not a neat fit. There is a little too much going on which means that for instance Oxford disappears for large chunks of time. Too bad. Ifans plays him like a fey rock star and its a perfect portrayal. He squanders his fortune and land while writing and no one in the world with the possible exception of Johnson understands why (certainly his family does not). Ifans gets at the heart of creation how it trumps everything even good sense. Hes a lot of fun to watch. Everyone is actually. Like most films that dabble in history but dont let it get in the way of a good story ""Anonymous"" shouldnt be your guide to an accurate representation of Elizabethan England -- youd flunk a test probably. But as richly enjoyable costume dramas go it makes the grade quite nicely. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Joely Richardson and Jamie Campbell Bower in Anonymous (Reiner Bajo) C- Anonymous Genre PG-13 Drama; Starring Rhys Ifans Vanessa Redgrave; Director Roland Emmerich; Release Date Wide 10/28/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 130; Distributor Sony Pictures Releasing Posted November 1 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT According to Anonymous the plays and sonnets attributed to lower-class William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) were in fact written by Edward de Vere (Rhys Ifans) the upper-class Earl of Oxford. According to Anonymous Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave and daughter Joely Richardson depending on Her Majestys age) was a lusty bed-hopper who bore more than one illegitimate child. According to Anonymous de Vere was one of the Queens lovers and also one of her...well never mind because Anonymous might just as well also declare that Elizabethans lived in yurts and invented the game of Sudoku for all the pompous foolishness masquerading as intellectual provocation in this thumpingly silly yet self-serious period-piece what-if. The movie is a self-described passion project for Roland Emmerich the German-born director best known for making end-of-the-world disaster pics including Independence Day The Day After Tomorrow and 2012. The destruction here is confined to a turgid overload of intrigue concocted in cahoots with screenwriter John Orloff (A Mighty Heart) who fills his characters mouths with honking exposition interspersed with honking declarations of literary ardor along the lines of ""My poems are my soul"" Ifans is honorable and earnest in a star-crossed production; Redgrave does some queenly hamming in opulent costumes that might have been designed by Project Runway alumnus Chris March. But scholarly debate about the Shakespeare Authorship Question has little to do with this tale told by an idio...syncratic moviemaker up to little more than mischief.

"Anonymous (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Anonymous (PG-13) Disaster master Roland Emmerich (""2012"" ""Independence Day"") shifts gears for this conspiracy-theory drama about the work of William Shakespeare. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald10/27/2011 Editor rating 2 O for a Muse of fire -- even if hes not who we always thought he was. Thats the premise of director Roland Emmerichs Anonymous which clumsily posits that William Shakespeare -- glovers son actor pride of Stratford -- was not the author of the plays and poetry for which hes become famous. Instead Emmerich offers up a fashionable conspiracy theory involving political intrigue thwarted ambition love and revenge art and rebellion incest an army of illegitimate children (from the Virgin Queen no less) -- and one Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford as true creator of Hamlet and his brethren. Emmerich (2012 The Day After Tomorrow Independence Day) isnt the only true believer in Oxfords case and there have been other theories about other authors who would be Shakespeare. The problem isnt the theory which is entertaining if not persuasive (and only makes the slightest bit of sense if you believe all of Shakespeares plays are autobiographical). Shakespeare in Love was a fictional bauble too and it was delightful. But Anonymous far from ascending the brightest heaven of invention is a muddled often confusing film unable to mesh its political and theatrical plotlines. Worse it undermines its own argument by cramming in too many fanciful possibilities. Still the cast is impressive and the story even soapier than The Tudors if you like that sort of thing. The film stars the excellent Rhys Ifans as Oxford who has been a writer all his life. He begins to offer up plays for public performance when he sees a chance to undermine a political rival the queens right-hand man Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg) who aims to see James of Scotland on the throne. Oxford and the Cecils have a past. The earl had a stormy relationship with Cecils father William (David Thewlis) who was his guardian and had vainly tried to keep the young Oxford from writing -- and out of the bedchamber of Queen Elizabeth (played by Joely Richardson and later Vanessa Redgrave). Over time the older Oxfords relationship with the Queen has grown frosty but he still wants to do whats right for England. He asks playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to claim authorship of the comedies and tragedies he turns out at a startling rate. Jonson refuses but blowhard actor Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) is more than happy to take the credit the applause and a stiff fee for his silence. The CGI effects Emmerich uses effectively in his end-of-the-world flicks lack any magic here but the lively theatrical scenes in which rapt audiences are alternately roused or moved to tears are thrilling; they capture the mighty power of this poetry regardless of who wrote it. The amusing Spall provides the films humor making Shakespeare a slob of a fellow dim greedy and far more concerned with booze and wenches than art. But recreating the political entanglements of the Essex rebellion against Elizabeth poses a problem for the filmmakers; there are too many characters and the plot grows too complicated rendering the narrative far-fetched and hard to follow. The queen herself lacks any backbone. Writer John Orloff (A Mighty Heart Legend of the Guardians The Owls of Gahoole) portrays one of Britains most powerful monarchs as a dithery and petulant young woman and an addled old one. Elizabeth held the throne for more than 40 years; under her reign the British defeated the Spanish Armada and ushered in a new era in which drama flourished. Anonymous turns out to be more propaganda than drama -- and not terribly convincing propaganda at that. Cast Rhys Ifans Vanessa Redgrave David Thewlis Edward Hogg Rafe Spall Joely Richardson.

"Anonymous movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Elizabethan lit intrigue proves not that intriguing in Anonymous -- 2 1/2 starsOctober 27 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Anonymous"" is ridiculous and like Oliver Stones ""JFK"" it sells its political conspiracy theories by weight and by volume.But dull its not.Plus Vanessa Redgrave is so good as Queen Elizabeth I that even committed Stratfordians -- those who believe William Shakespeares plays and sonnets were written by William Shakespeare -- will concede that director Roland Emmerichs rabid anti-Stratfordian diversion carries a touch of poetry along with its spittle-flecked prose.Emmerich who made his pile on such piquant schlock as ""10000 B.C."" and ""2012"" seems like a peculiar choice for this material. Midway through ""Anonymous"" it still seems that way.And by the end when history is simultaneously being made up and rewritten it still seems that way. Yet you cannot imagine anyone else making it certainly not with such a rollicking belief in its own nutty bombast.""Henry V"" style screenwriter John Orloff begins in modern-day Manhattan where Sir Derek Jacobi no less is performing a speculative solo piece on a Broadway stage based on the theories were about to see unfold. Imagine he exhorts that Shakespeares plays came from someone else. Shakespeare seen here as a murderous craven loser played by Rafe Spall is strictly a supporting character in ""Anonymous."" This carousing 16th century London actor becomes the front for Edward de Vere the Earl of Oxford whose zest for the theater and for poetic expression is expressly discouraged by the royals. Rhys Ifans lends a sense of gravity and grace to de Vere who first approaches playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to have de Veres ""Henry V"" produced under Jonsons name. No way Jonson says. Get someone else to be your little beard. Enter the man from Stratford.Time and space prohibit a full accounting of what ""Anonymous"" believes if it really believes any of it. Highlights de Vere wrote ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"" when he was still a preteen. The Earl of Oxford is not merely the young queens lover; he is also related to her by blood shall we say. With the Tudors and the Cecils scheming against each other for control of the throne the burgeoning Essex rebellion captures de Veres political fancy and he writes plays such as ""Henry V"" and later ""Richard III"" as propaganda potboilers designed to foment revolution.For all the digital evocations of the era some of which are quite nice (though Emmerich rarely allows us to get a good look at anything for more than a second or two) the movie looks best in its heavily candle-lit studio interiors. Emmerich and cinematographer Anna J. Foerster shot ""Anonymous"" on the new Arri Alexa digital camera allowing them a lovely copper-and-honey-toned palette warmer than the average high-def digital. In dramatic terms the film catches its breath and settles down whenever Ifans de Vere or Redgraves queen dominate the story.Like the wittier ""Amadeus"" ""Anonymous"" is propelled by artistic jealousies among famous geniuses and their enemies. Like the much much wittier ""Shakespeare in Love"" ""Anonymous"" imagines a torrent of intrigues though Emmerichs granite touch doesnt exactly tease out the subtleties. ""A little costume B-movie"" is how Emmerich described ""Anonymous"" to one London journalist. A week after seeing it what I remember of it most vividly has nothing to do either with de Vere or with Shakespeare Its the way Redgrave gazes out a window her reign near the end her eyes full of regret but also of fiery defiance of the balderdash lapping at her feet.mjphillipstribune.comAnonymous -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for some violence and sexual content)Cast Rhys Ifans (Edward De Vere); Vanessa Redgrave (Queen Elizabeth I); Joely Richardson (Young Queen Elizabeth I); David Thewlis (William Cecil); Xavier Samuel (Earl of Southampton); Sebastian Armesto (Ben Jonson); Rafe Spall (William Shakespeare)Credits Directed by Roland Emmerich; written by John Orloff; produced by Roland Emmerich Larry Franco and Robert Leger.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Everything viewers need to know about Anonymous--and about the whole stupid world of anti-Stratfordians the conspiracy theorists who believe William Shakespeare was not the author of the plays and poems that bear his name--can be gleaned by the pronunciation of a single word in the films first scene. Derek Jacobi frames the film as a narrator speaking before a live audience and questioning whether the son of a glovemaker could truly have written Shakespeares work sneering his way through ""glovemaker"" as if the word were synonymous with garbage. Anti-Stratfordianism is based on the highly questionable and prejudiced notion that a man of Shakespeares genius couldnt possibly have come from common stock. So who might have written Shakespeare then? The most popular theory and the one championed by director Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow 2012) and writer John Orloff here posits Edward De Vere the 17th Earl Of Oxford as the most likely candidate. Rhys Ifans plays him here as a humorless snoot (the perfect hero for the anti-Stratfordian crowd in other words). Falling in and out of favor with the court De Vere writes his plays in secret then sensing that he can use them to advance a political agenda employs Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to bring them to the stage where a drunken actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) takes the credit. Playing Shakespeare as a shameless egotistical ham Spalls performance is both the most insulting and the most entertaining element of Anonymous livening up an otherwise dull slog through Elizabethan palace intrigue thats seldom all that intriguing. Switching from the dubious science of his disaster films to dubious history Emmerich never really explains who his players are or what drives them stringing together declamatory scenes of angry men talking to angrier men that will probably confuse--and offend--even those who brushed up on their history before watching the movie. Vanessa Redgrave overacts as the aged Elizabeth (played in younger years by Joely Richardson Redgraves daughter) Emmerich fills his CGI London with bitchy caricatures of Christopher Marlowe Thomas Kyd and others and it all works toward some late-film twists that are even more ridiculous than the anti-Shakespeare theory at the films core (which is saying something). Its as dull as it is brainless the work of creators whove spent far more time concocting silly stories about Shakespeare than learning from him.

By Mary Pols MaryPolsOct. 26 2011 Share Read Later Reiner Bajo / Columbia TriStarSam Reid as the Earl of Essex in Anonymous Anonymous Year 2011 Director Roland Emmerich Studio Columbia Pictures Actors Rhys Ifans Joely Richardson Vanessa Redgrave David Thewlis RelatedEmmerich and Ifans Cast Doubt on Shakespeare Associated Press Video Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The tag line on the poster for Roland Emmerichs Anonymous reads ""Was Shakespeare a Fraud?"" Given the long history of William Shakespeare as Hollywood source and subjectthis might be the only new angle left. And odd though the question may be it matches our current cultural mindset where everything is suspect and nothing worth trusting. Witness last weeks raging debate ""Is Beyonces Baby Bump a Fraud?"" The ""evidence"" was a slow motion clip of Beyonce sitting down on a talk show set either causing her detachable baby bump to shift or her dress to billow in the breeze created by her downward motion. I favor the latter explanation also known as a sensibly presumed truth just as I believe William Shakespeare wrote a few plays in his day. But thats just me. Emmerich thinks differently and his approach to the Shakespeare question is Oxfordian with a twist of Prince Tudor. Having thoroughly examined our fictional future through a cynical and histrionic (but not humorless) lens in Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow Emmerich has turned his attention to the past. He and screenwriter John Orloff (A Mighty Heart) have embraced a kitchen sinks worth of 20th-century conspiracy theories about the provenance of Shakespeares plays each wilder than the last. Oliver Stones JFK looks reasonable compared to this. (MORE Top 10 Historically Misleading Films) The first theory the Oxfordian originally put forth by John Thomas Looney in 1920 is that Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford wrote everything that has since been attributed to Shakespeare. In Anonymous Edward (Rhys Ifans) dashes off a version of A Midsummers Nights Dream at the tender age of nine. But his literary efforts were considered an improper use of a noblemans time - ""youre writing again"" his wife hisses as if shed caught him fondling the scullery maid. ""Why must you continue to humiliate my family?"" Thus he scribbles in secret. Borrowing from later variations on Looneys research known as the two-part Prince Tudor theories Anonymous Edward is finally motivated to allow his previously private plays to be performed for romantic sentimental and political reasons. You see when he was younger and prettier (and played by Jamie Campbell Bower) Edward had a torrid affair with Queen Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) and from their firelit bear-rug unions was born a child. On the orders of her fiercely puritanical advisor Sir William Cecil (David Thewlis) the boy was raised as the Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel) and is now old enough to interfere with Cecils desire to crown as king the son of Mary Queen of Scots. Even having come up with the Oxfordian theory Looney dismissed the bastard child theory as ""likely to bring the whole cause into ridicule."" If he thought that was ridiculous hed have been gobsmacked by Anonymous final twist. The movie doesnt just ask us to throw out all we thought we knew about Shakespeare. Elizabeth is a silly puppet as immature in her 60s (played by Richardsons mother Vanessa Redgrave) as she is in her 30s. She cant even keep track of where her many bastard sons end up. Emmerich has glommed onto a theory that is both snobbish--stripping Shakespeares creative powers because he was a commoner--and sexist turning Elizabeth into a cute ninny who just likes to watch plays and worry about the state of her teeth. But speaking of Shakespeare where is he in all this? Usually atop a whore or trying to wheedle spare change out of someone. It must be said that if Shakespeare is to be portrayed as a buffoon of middling charms and great greed actor Rafe Spall (son of actor Timothy Spall) is just the man for the job. The younger Spall who could pass for Joseph Fiennes portly cousin (remember when movie makers dreamed of Shakespeare in Love not in larceny?)  gives a giggly performance seemingly modeled on Tom Hulces Mozart in Amadeus. Hes a hoot. But Shakespeare is not even Edwards choice for the man to assume responsibilities for his work. That would be playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) handpicked by Edward for the most complimentary of reasons ""You have no voice"" Ben stands hapless while Edward riffles through his piles of leather bound manuscripts and starts piling them into Jonsons arms. Every play Edward hands off is either a secret love letter to Elizabeth (Romeo and Juliet) or a piece of propaganda designed to be a thorn in the side of Cecil and his hunchbacked son Robert (Richard III). Hilariously Ben isnt even impressed enough by the work to lease out his name to Edward but shady Shakespeare has no such scruples. I dont know what conspiracy theory Emmerich consulted that made Ben Jonson the necessary middleman in this fantastical tale of literary misattribution but he does it must be said sew it all up together rather tidily. Take for instance the fact that the real Edward 17th Earl of Oxford died in 1604 and 12 new ""Shakespeare "" plays appeared after that date. Emmerich and Orloff have an explanation The movie throws justifications at us with the same unwavering determination as a small child arguing the need to stay up past bedtime. As Edward Ifans plays it all to the hilt seething simmering and arching an imperious brow at the lowly theater types. Its a fun role especially for a man who might be eager to slough off the enduring image of himself as that unappealing dope in Notting Hill standing in his underwear agog at Julia Roberts. He sells this high camp entertainment as well as one could but Anonymous sticks in the craw. It is speculation presented as history for the gullible a nonsensical fiction that is woefully representative of how little credence contemporary society gives to the possibility that sometimes people tell the truth. When Beyonce gives birth even if that baby has her eyes and Jay-Zs lips gossip sites will question from whence it came just as some of those who see Emmerichs film might believe the Bard was just the pawn in a lovelorn Earls Elizabethan soap opera.

Anonymous speculates that the Bards plays and sonnets were written inside royal chambers by Edward de Vere the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans).While its claims are unsubstantiated this handsome costume drama sets forth an involving scenario surrounding Queen Elizabeth (played in her older years by Vanessa Redgrave and by Joely Richardson in her younger randier days) known as the ""Virgin Queen"" and includes the supposition of her many illicit affairs.MORE Rafe Spall relishes idiot Shakespeare roleThe theory is that an orphaned Oxford was taken in as a ward by royal adviser William Cecil (David Thewlis). Cecil -- and most others in the court excluding Elizabeth -- believed writing to be utterly useless even devilish so the literary earl asks Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to lend his name. Jonson hesitates and up steps William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) portrayed as an illiterate buffoon.A costume drama seems an odd choice for action director Emmerich (2012) yet he effectively sows seeds of doubt by informing us that none of Shakespeares works were found written in his own hand. The way in which Oxfords work becomes credited to Shakespeare is laid out in labyrinthine style following the earls affair with the queen.About the movieAnonymous 1/2 out of fourStars Rhys Ifans Vanessa Redgrave David Thewlis Joely Richardson Sebastian Armesto Rafe Spall Director Roland EmmerichDistributor Sony Pictures Rating PG-13 for some violence and sexual content Running time 2 hours 10 minutes Opens Thursday in select citiesIn the first half hour however events are muddled by skipping back and forth in time excessively. The film mangles facts and traffics in fabrications and already has incited the ire of historians and literary experts. Dubious history aside Anonymous is a well-acted yarn that also is a tribute to the unstoppable force of art -- even if it implies that only an aristocrat could create it. Ifans is convincingly world-weary as the earl who prefers writing sonnets to the pageantry of court life. Anonymous aims to be epic but is closer to stately soap opera.

Keen insight and rapier-like subtlety are not Emmerichs strong suits so instead he has chosen the path of pure excess bodices are ripped swords unsheathed moustachioes waxed pantaloons tightened and scenery chewed; every villain wears a dastardly leer and every hero a proud glint. But Anonymous is not simply slapstick and silliness John Orloffs meaty script handles the central art versus politics debate in broad but convincing terms and his placing of Shakespeares texts in a contemporary political context lends the fiery on-stage scenes within the newly built Globe theatre a genuine charge. The cast is strong and while shameless hams like Rafe Spall as boozy womanising gadabout Will Shakespeare and Edward Hogg as hunched Richard III-alike Robert Cecil tend to steal the show there are moments of subtlety with the mother-daughter team of Joely Richardson and Vanessa Redgrave bringing unexpected pathos to their roles as Queen Bess. But the most pleasing aspect of Anonymous is its sheer sense of fun.

""This man had written his first concerto at the age of 4... his first symphony at 7 a full-scale opera at 12"" he keeps telling himself wondering the halls expecting Mozart to be this serious profound young man but then when he meets him he gets slapped down with ""That was Mozart That giggling dirty creature Id just seen crawling on the floor."" and Forman too had to battle with people who were convinced that Mozart was composing on white pedestal surrounded with golden bars and elephant tusks. Well this move is told from that point of view. Shakespeares plays must have been written by a distinguished person in some sort of laboratory who was joining power of the universe with derogative human nature in order to directly shape the world. But really? Shakespeare was not a walking institution. He probably didnt care about calligraphy or even the design of his autograph he was more concerned about entertaining the people. OK but what about the rest of it? It was an OK historical drama with some interesting scenes but kind of stillborn on account that it was built on this falsehood and I expected to enjoy the movie for the sheer of it but it wasnt much possible since its authors are so infatuated with this belief that Shakespeare was a fraud. Even Derek Jacobi himself believes this.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 17 2011GwynFeaturedI thought it was absolutely FAB Had to see it a second time.........And if it was still on in Manchester Id go and see it again ..............Twice.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 17 2011GwynFeaturedI thought it was absolutely FAB Had to see it a second time.........And if it was still on in Manchester Id go and see it again ..............Twice.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 13 2011RichFeaturedThe visual effects of period London are simply gorgeous.

A minor point perhaps but here goes. The actors who played Shakespeare and Marlowe had a passing resemblance to the playwrights but the bloke who played Ben Jonson looked nothing like him. Was this because Jonson was rather squat and ugly?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 2 2011Peter FareyFeaturedDaryl is right. Ian and Mary confidently state that Marlowe and Shakespeare were ""already in vogue before Marlowes death"" and ""producing work simultaneously"". Easy to assert but far harder to prove. There is evidence that the following four plays with rather longer titles were  in the repertory of Lord Stranges and Earl of Pembrokes Men before Marlowes supposed death in 1593 ""Henry the Sixth"" ""The First part of the Contention"" ""The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York"" and ""The Taming of A Shrew"". There is no evidence from that time that Shakespeare had anything to do with them however and indeed the authorship of all of them has been much disputed. Furthermore when Francis Meres listed twelve plays by Shakespeare in 1598 none of them was mentioned. In fact it was not until 30 years after Marlowes demise that the three ""Henry VI"" plays and ""The Taming of the Shrew"" (plays believed to have been those earlier four albeit with significant differences) were finally associated with Shakespeare in the First Folio of his works. So did he write those earlier versions or simply ""improve"" them later?

Whats more to the point it neednt have mattered if this film had been approached a different way. I went to see this not expecting a masterpiece but unprepared for the level of innacuracy and historical revision which amounted to an absolute fiction regarding everyone involved and even its period. The only way to have approached this project was on the level of camp entertainment. Sadly though the film cant really be taken seriously the scriptwriter director and actors take it far too seriously indeed; the pacing is completely leade characters either overdeveloped or underdeveloped and it is already overlong by the point when its last improbable plot twist finished it goes into a half-hour long coda which serves no purpose other than to erase the audiences last will to live. Desperately moribund and bloated the result is both preposterous and boring the second adjective denoting a cardinal sin. By no means the worst film of the year but by no means even a good one. I had expected a bit better than this. a moment of unintentional comedy comes at the death of this whole self-indulgent act of collective vanity when the orator seems to be being taken seriously by his audience while laying out to them the truth despite the fact theyd have wanted to pelt him with rotten cabbages for his tall stories well before the end of his spiel.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 26 2011neil patersonFeaturedi cant see what the fuss is all about. i loved every bonkers minute of it. tosh from start to finish but very well made and acted tosh and it also looks stunning..FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 26 2011MikeFeaturedHmmm.

The film written by devout ""Oxfordian"" John Orloff begins with a modern-day prologue in which Sir Derek Jacobi lays out the scenario casting doubt on the signature of ""Shake-speare."" Next to the burning of the Globe Theatre--ahistorically staged in 1603--where playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) attempts to save the First Folio from agents of destruction. Why the fuss? The flashbacks within flashbacks continue hopping back another five years to 1598 telling the story of de Veres clandestine authorship intercut with backstory from his life the earliest being a performance of A Midsummer Nights Dream in which the nine-year-old prodigy de Vere plays Puck before the court the beginning of a long dalliance with Queen Elizabeth I (played in dotage by Vanessa Redgrave in youth by Redgraves daughter Joely Richardson).The conspiracy starts when de Vere (Rhys Ifans) a member of the peerage witnesses a performance of Jonsons work being shut down as seditious and hatches a plan to use the power of theater to sway public opinion in support of his young friend the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) in his bid to succeed the aging Elizabeth. They are opposed in this by Elizabeths advisers William and Robert Cecil (David Thewlis and Edward Hogg) father and son black-clad courtiers who wish to see James of Scotland on the throne--and are inconveniently de Veres in-laws. De Vere having sworn to his wifes family that he would set down his pen first chooses Jonson as the public face to take credit for his verse--but the credit is usurped by a drunken whoremongering actor named you guessed it Bill Shakespeare (Rafe Spall).As Oxfordians and Stratfordians clash over Anonymous--the Wikipedia entry is a battleground--one line has been much discussed in which the ""inventor of the human"" per Harold Bloom Shakespeare/de Vere pronounces that ""all art is political otherwise it is just decoration."" In terms of the film this means that the corpus attributed to Shakespeare is merely pretext for political cartooning Hamlets Polonius becomes a burlesque of William Cecil; Richard III is a parody of humpbacked Robert meant to stir up sentiment against the pro-James I element. This would be an appalling simplification of these works but Anonymous is generally so muddled as to de Veres artistic aims its hard to take seriously--especially in comparison to the recent The Mill and the Cross which situated Pieter Bruegels political protest within an entire philosophical and aesthetic cosmology.The tagline to Anonymous asks ""Was Shakespeare a Fraud?"" Possibly but the films director Roland Emmerich is definitely a hack albeit an occasionally lively one. The auteur of 2012 and Independence Day--which incidentally featured Bill Pullman doing a knockoff of the St. Crispins Day Speech in Henry V--only indulges his appetite for the spectacular in a few aerials of an impressively revived Elizabethan London including the striking-if-absurd image of the queens funeral cortege being led along a frozen Thames.If Anonymous werent such a self-serious faux expose the fact that the queen actually died in the thaw of March would little matter. But though Shakespeare was known to turn out some rather juiced-up histories himself it is the particular idiocy of our time that the past is apparently only marketable via Da Vinci Code conspiratorial jabbering here degrading the canon to the level of the potboiler. (For good measure Anonymous spices up de Veres story with an element of incest.)Emmerichs movie is sporadically enjoyable trash with better performances than it has any right to Hoggs verminous villain leaves a trail of cold oozing hisses. As an unnamed player former Globe director Mark Rylance gives rousing readings from Shake . . . sorry de Vere. And Ifans under arched brows and eyeshade offers de Vere as a figure of grand regal isolation anxiously rubbing his ink-stained fingers from the box seats. The late arrival of a swishy lisping James I however gives the final reassurance This is high camp nothing more.

Here he rips apart the playwrights legacy with the fringe theory that argues the true author was the 17th Earl of Oxford Edward de Vere (Rys Ifans). The movies fundamental conceit that an aristocrat harbored a closet desire to write plays and paid off an actor to produce them maintains a fantastical appeal. However Emmerich takes the story at face value and delivers a film unlike any of his others. That is to say a boring one. Elizabethan costumes supplant his penchant for CGI tomfoolery; unadulterated fun gives way to flat drama. Emmerichs attempt to work on a grand scale of historical fiction dodges its potential for guilty pleasures -- and this comes from a man arguably better attuned to guilty pleasures than any other commercial filmmaker working today. Emmerichs interest in the pioneer of modern stage drama is intriguing and he does show an interest in story no matter how thin throughout his work. His movies carry out high concept to its fullest extreme which sets them apart from the mindless action routines of Michael Bays ""Transformers"" trilogy. Cinema has replaced theater as the dominant form of cultural expression and Emmerichs unwieldy disaster movies illustrate cinemas spectacular possibilities on a primal scale. Shakespeares work has been subjected to countless high-concept makeovers so Emmerichs interest in a reboot of Shakespeare himself almost makes sense. However Emmerich works against his strengths when he tries to play it straight. In ""Anonymous"" the concept is established from the start and then drags for more than two hours. Emmerich displays no capacity for legitimate human drama; ""Anonymous"" reveals that the emperor of spectacle has no clothes. Strangely enough the movie arrives in the theaters at the same time that another curious tidbit of Shakespeare news has floated into the pop culture sphere On Monday ""The Avengers"" director Joss Whedon announced that he secretly completed shooting a low-budget black-and-white adaptation of Shakespeares ""Much Ado About Nothing"" made on a tight production schedule with his usual roster of stars. The abrupt revelation generated intense excitement a response that had little to do with the prospects of another Shakespeare adaptation and everything to do with anticipation of another Joss Whedon movie the cult auteur behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" It hardly matters whether or not Shakespeare wrote it; the text exists. Nevertheless Emmerich clearly thinks otherwise churning out a droll costume drama that follows the grief-stricken de Vere through the years in which he keeps his talent a secret in war-stricken Elizabethan England. Desperate to land his works on the stage partly as a bid to support the rebellion of the 2nd Earl of Essex against Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave) he hires young playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to take the credit. Out of his league Jonson hires a foolish actor -- that would be Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) -- to front for the work. Tensions mount Shakespeare grows comfortable in the limelight and the Earl of Oxford continually struggles with suppressing his penchant for composition. The best part of the Earls story has little to do with the Shakespearean conspiracy; its an amusingly twisted development surrounding his parentage and the possibilities of incest. When the angle comes to the fore ""Anonymous"" hints at the greater possibilities of pure sensationalism that Emmerich generally ignores. Of course if Emmerich wants to take a break from the popcorn aesthetic more power to him. But ""Anonymous"" has the same clumsy look as his disaster epics without their juvenile appeal. The storys emotion lies in small moments between the Earl and the various power players in charge of his destiny but these scenes move sluggishly and are held down by an unseemly blend of self-seriousness and camp. Emmerich does include a single ingenious bookend device The entire story is framed as a Broadway play with the magisterial Derek Jacobi introducing the drama in front of a packed house. That approach literally sets the stage for an exciting revisionist tale but nothing that follows lives up to the promise. Emmerich drags Shakespeare into a ditch and flogs his legacy without any modicum of freshness. Which brings us back to Whedons upcoming addition an exciting project for the same reason that ""Anonymous"" offers nothing new. From his cleverly episodic ""Dr. Horribles Sing-Along Blog"" to his interaction with fans Whedon maintains an innovative approach to his brand that makes the prospects of his lo-fi Shakespeare adaptation worthy of the eager response. If Shakespeares work is the essence of modern narrative it now faces the prospects of evolution along with the numerous formats of contemporary storytelling. From amateur iPhone videos and Tumblrs to countless methods of sharing and posting questions of provenance are less relevant than the specific application of ideas. In Shakespeares case whether or not he wrote anything the bard belongs to us all. criticWIRE grade C- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Realizing that it was a tough sell Columbia Pictures downgraded the plans for an immediate wide release of ""Anonymous"" and now plans to open it this weekend in 250 theaters gradually rolling out the movie across the country. However given the mixed reaction by critics and the silly premise that might preclude Shakespeare purists ""Anonymous"" faces an uphill battle.

What Will You See? Comments Howard Schumann May 12 2016 431 pm Both the academic establishment and the Stratford tourist industry have a lot to lose if the truth is told and accepted and the Stratford mythology is finally put to rest. This film is a challenge to them their reputation even their livelihood. We are living in a time of great change and people are clinging desperately to what is safe and comfortable. It takes a pioneer like Orloff and Emmerich who have a passion for the truth to wake people up. The important thing is to be able to take another look at lazily accepted assumptions that on closer examination are little but guesswork and conjecture. People have been hoodwinked and bamboozled by all the ""protectors"" of the status quo who dont bother to discuss the evidence like some critics they are too busy throwing around words like silly nonsense hogwash and the like. They want you to believe that a man who had little or no education whose children were illiterate who never left any writing other than six unreadable signatures with his name spelled differently in each one who never traveled outside of London who spent much time and effort engaging in petty lawsuits who could not read books in French Italian or Spanish yet used untranslated material as his source material who never left any books in his will who left no letters no correspondence who did not elicit a single eulogy at his death was the greatest writer in the English language. Have you ever heard anything sillier than that? Reply Len Oclair May 12 2016 431 pm Clever stuff all in all an engaging film. The weakness of the film is making Will be such an out and out cad w/ no intellectual powers. In fact Shakespeare was surrounded by very good actors. Thus when Burbage was rehearsing Hamlet he was able pull Will aside and say ""Let me try something here e.g. ""To be or not to be..."" etc. Imagine what that means to a playwright where the actor gets to flesh out the authors theme. But ""Anonymous"" is great funGreat acting moments But tongue in cheek all the way Reply ernesto texeiras May 12 2016 431 pm This movie is a total disaster. No redeeming aspects. The reviewer is overly generous Reply M. G. Scarsbrook May 12 2016 431 pm Whatever you think of the authorship question this is a well-made and well-acted film set in one of the most intriguing periods of English history - an era with so many stories to tell. The filmmakers should be commended for that. - M. G.

By David Denby Kevin Spacey Stanley Tucci Jeremy Irons Simon Baker and Demi Moore.   Credit Illustration by Mark Ulriksen In ""Margin Call"" the executives working late at an imperilled investment firm in Manhattan stand in an office tower and stare at the lights and the streets below wondering if the great city isnt a dream. The movie is a fictionalized account of a disastrous twenty-four hours in 2008 when ""financial instruments"" that had seemed solid dissolved into air. The rush of panic is halted now and then by moments of disbelief. Earlier in the movie two of the companys young analysts sitting in the back of a Lincoln Town Car look out at the people walking by and marvel at how little they comprehend of what is about to hit them. As visual and verbal rhetoric the awe-inspiring appearance of Manhattan at night and the moods of choking anxiety arent terribly fresh but the writing and the acting in ""Margin Call"" are so good that we get completely caught up. When the investment guys ask if were aware of whats happening we look at them and ask the same thing. What were people like this thinking? How could men and women paid fortunes for their judgment have continued as late as 2008 to package repackage and sell billions of dollars in bonds backed by subprime mortgages? Our sense of the unreality of their enterprise is far greater than their wonder at our innocence. As the movie opens people at the firm are being summoned to a glass-walled conference room and politely told to clear out. Among the victims is an uncomplaining risk-management executive Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) who leaving with nineteen years of his life in a cardboard box passes a flash drive to Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) one of the young analysts. ""Be careful"" he says. Staying late on the trading floor and plugging Dales numbers into standard volatility models Sullivan quickly understands if the mortgage-backed securities currently on the companys books which are heavily leveraged decline in value by an additional twenty-five per cent the companys losses will be greater than its total market capitalization. ""Margin Call"" is one of the strongest American films of the year and easily the best Wall Street movie ever made. Its about corporate manners--the protocols of hierarchy the rituals of power and most of all the difficulty of confronting flagrant habits of speculation with truth. That moment is avoided until its absolutely necessary at which point communication among the responsible parties becomes exceptionally nasty. The young writer-director J. C. Chandor has made documentaries and commercials but hes never had a script produced before and this is his first feature as a director. Chandors only obvious qualification is that his father spent forty years at Merrill Lynch which like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers destroyed itself with an excess of mortgage-backed securities and finally in 2008 subsided at a bargain rate into the arms of a wealthier firm. Chandor is a beginner but to my ears the terse generally understated yet sometimes barbarously rude language feels exactly right. I would guess that he has studied David Mamets work digesting the dramatic value of repetition and silence in say ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" along with the plays stunned outrage and the characters strangely displaced almost disembodied reactions as some appalling reality swings into view. Chandors prickly script attracted a talented cast. At the company Sullivans findings quickly work their way upward first to his immediate superior Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) a cocky cynical free-spending pit boss with a streak of decency; then to the longtime head of trading Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey) a lonely man who believes that the company does some good in the world and finds himself grieving excessively over his dog who is dying of cancer (a decent enough symbol); then to the head of risk Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore) who warned of danger but still has to take the fall; then to their boss Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) a severely controlled corporate snake; and then at last to the C.E.O. John Tuld (Jeremy Irons). Tuld sweeps in by helicopter assembles everyone in a conference room at 2 A.M. and with debonair flourishes devises a desperate strategy dump the ""greatest pile of odiferous excrement in the history of capitalism"" the next day; sell all of it at discounted rates in a few hours before word gets around to buyers that the paper is nearly worthless. There are a few such group meetings in ""Margin Call"" but most of the scenes play out with just two or three characters bullying or appeasing one another. (Is this guy my ally? Will I survive this mess?) Chandor has worked out what all these people think of one another while keeping the drama steadily moving forward--no easy job--and if theres a false note or an overwrought scene in ""Margin Call"" I couldnt find it. Chandor has just enough camera technique to do what he needs to do. In this largely indoor movie the city looming outside is a palpable presence; the camera quiet and relentless in moments of confrontation tracks silently at night through the empty trading floor a ghost invading a once healthy company. The second half of the movie is devoted principally to the conflict between Tuld (his name a not too subtle play on that of Dick Fuld the former head of Lehman) who thinks that investment is merely the greatest of games and always subject to bubbles and crashes; and Sam Rogers who hesitates to carry out Tulds strategy on the plausible ground that if you peddle junk to your customers they will never buy anything from you again. Kill trust and you kill the market he says. But Tuld waves away his worries. The game will go on he believes; the firm will rise again and make money. Irons is stentorian charming threatening. Spacey after a long career of playing acidulous bad guys gives a performance of surprising gentleness. As Rogers sleepless makes a speech to his traders in the morning prepping them for the unsavory task ahead Spaceys body slumps and his facial muscles go slack. Will Rogers walk out on Tuld? In ""Margin Call"" money insistently pushes its way into personal decisions; the movie is sympathetic to the executives plight but hard-nosed about their constant desire to elevate pay packages over principle. No one ever says as much but of course the toxic assets were assembled in the first place and were sold well past the danger point because the fees from doing so were high enough to extinguish caution. Until the last moment the smugly reckless top executives dont even comprehend the firms exposure; they need the fledglings peering into computer models to explain it to them (not an exaggeration of what happened at several firms). If Wall Street executives find themselves at a loss to understand what the protesters outside are getting at they could do worse than watch this movie for a few clues. You cant keep the bastards straight in ""Anonymous"" a large-scale and preposterous fantasia about Queen Elizabeth I the Earl of Oxford and the nefarious plot to set up a faker--a conceited barely literate whoring actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall)--as a great playwright and poet. Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) it seems was no virgin but a randy young queen; she frequently had to retire to the countryside where she delivered many illegitimate children who were then brought up by acquiescent nobles. Among her lovers is Edward de Vere the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans) who in this telling is the actual author of Shakespeares plays. Oxford is also her--well I wont spoil a story already so rotten that as Shakespeare or rather Oxford might put it the kites wheel and shriek rather than batten on so foul a carcass. ""Anonymous"" is a farrago. If you can tell as the illegitimate sons grow up which of the dashing young gentlemen is Southampton (Xavier Samuel) and which is Essex (Sam Reid) and why they matter and what the plot to hide the authorship of the plays has to do with the struggle to find a successor to the officially childless Elizabeth then you are more willing than I to get trapped in the London muck and fog that the movie makes so much of. The films American writer John Orloff and its German director Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" ""2012"") have revived the dreariest of snobberies the long-held notion that the son of a tradesman in Stratford-upon-Avon--a boy who had received no more than a secondary-school education--couldnt possibly have known enough about kingship the nobility and classical literature to write those poems and plays. They must have been written by an aristocrat like Oxford. Yet the verse that appeared under Oxfords own name is insipid and he died in 1604 before ""Macbeth"" ""King Lear"" and ""The Tempest"" among other works were first produced. The Oxford theory is ridiculous yet the filmmakers go all the way with it producing endless scenes of indecipherable court intrigue in dark smoky rooms and a fashion show of ruffs farthingales and halberds. The more far-fetched the idea it seems the more strenuous the effort to pass it off as authentic.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Plus Anonymous deserves to be lost to history. _ By David Edelstein Published Oct 24 2011 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Paramount Vantage) Men have died and worms have eaten them but not for love says Shakespeares Rosalind to her adored Orlando and it might be truebut try telling someone in the fetal position weeping over the loss of a lover thinking only of a future as worm food. In Like Crazy Drake Doremus gives you a dangerously enflamed dose of first love from infatuation to intoxication to addiction to withdrawal and re-addiction. The movie is painful to watch even though its not especially deep or psychologicalas painful as seeing the radiantly happy face of a child in that fraction of a second between his or her tripping and connecting with a hard object when theres nothing you can do except brace for the cruel end of innocence. See AlsoAnton Yelchin on His Role in Like Crazy The boy Jacob (Anton Yelchin) is American; the girl Anna (Felicity Jones) English. Theyre in the same media-studies college class in L.A. She leaves a note for him under his windshield. (Please dont think Im a nutcase ) He calls. (Graceland? Thats my favorite album) She has big eyes and big English teeth that give her an appealing forwardness and is very pretty. He has curly hair and is almost as pretty. God theyre youngso tender so giddily undefended that it hurts just to look at them. The handheld camera gets all giddy too. It moves in close scanning one upturned face and then the other. Kiss already The last love story this infectious Richard Linklaters Before Sunrise evoked the mounting excitement of an all-night baring-of-souls bull session but Like Crazy happens at a pre-verbal level. At one point snapshots of the sleeping/smooching/frolicking couple take the place of scenes but you dont miss the dialogue. Those pictures feel as if theyre being spit out of our collective photo-booth unconscious. Doremuss choice of impediments is shrewd not absurdly easy to overcome as in most rom-coms but not soaked in fatalism as in doomed-lover psychodramas like Blue Valentine. Jacob and Anna cant tear themselves away from each other so she overstays her visa and cant get back into the country. His quirky-furniture-design business wouldnt fit as snugly into a London milieu as it does in Venice Beach. She makes waves writing for a London magazine. There are other lovers in the picturebeautiful devoted would-be mates like Jacobs assistant Sam (Jennifer Lawrence) and Annas neighbor Simon (Charlie Bewley). Would marrying Jacob make it easier for the couple to get back into the grooveas well as into the U.S.or would it be too much commitment too fast? Have they even gotten past the stage of projecting their true-love fantasies onto each other? I dont think they know. I dont think Doremus knows. Thats what makes the movie so intriguingand Jacobs LIKE CRAZY inscription on the bottom of a chair as in I love you like  so unnervingly prophetic. Like Crazy has a lively syntax and could in an ungrateful mood be tagged as slick. But Doremus gets the tempos right. The movie jumps when it needs to and slows when it must. Jones and Yelchin are madly attractive without ever seeming like glamorous movie stars. Did I mention how young they look? His facial hair is like a 14-year-olds first sad beard while shes a little girl playing at being a sophisticate. Neither can bear the weight of their first lovebut then who can? Like Crazys perspective is wonderfully sane. Roland Emmerichs Anonymous is a well-polished cowpat that will confuse and bore those who know nothing about Shakespeare and incense those who know almost anything. It does have the trappings and suits of scholarship. Derek Jacobi starts the movie off in modern Manhattan striding onto a Broadway stage and declaiming in tones more forceful than those I heard from him last spring at BAM (where his Lear ran the gamut from petulant to dotty) that Shakespeare left not a single manuscript behind and that the true story of the author of Hamlet is much darker. He is Edward de Vere seventeenth Earl of Oxford who could not by virtue of his rank have anything to do with the theater and so handed over his masterworksmany of which were not performed until well after his deathto a boobish actor named Will Shakespeare who incidentally was the one who stabbed Christopher Marlowe in the eye. Less improbably De Vere screwed Queen Elizabeth as well as (accidentally) his own mum. The script by John Orloff skips back and forth between the aged De Vere (Rhys Ifans) and his younger self (Jamie Campbell Bower) although the actors neither look nor sound like each other and transitions are nonexistent. (The old and young Elizabeth I have an easier time being played by the mother-daughter tag-team of Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson.) Ifans is forced into unbecoming poses such as freezing in horror when his puritanical wife discovers him with pen and parchment (Youre writing again) but its always fun to see him affect a grave countenance. I was puzzled though by his placid demeanor during the first performance of Hamlet in which the killing of Polonius comes before To be or not to bebut I suppose Emmerich would regard that as an academic quibble. Hes lucky hes 400 years beyond the scope of Britains laws of libel and sedition or else Shakespeare Marlowe Ben Jonson the Cecils pere and fils as well as Elizabeth I would be giving him a royal escort to the Tower. Apart from its ineptitude Anonymous is peculiarly beside the point. Shakespeares succession of masterpieces near masterpieces and thrilling misses is a miracle no matter who did the actual writing the actor-manager from Stratford-upon-Avon with the grammar-school education or De Vere Francis Bacon the Earl of Derby or Marlowe after faking his own death. Although the least implausible the Oxfordian caseinitially predicated on the idea that no one so meagerly schooled untraveled and unacquainted with court life could possibly have written so discerningly about kings queens thanes and Danesis so unbuttressed as to be laughable whereas books like Stephen Greenblatts Will in the World make splendid sense of the Stratford Shakespeares religion politics and sympathetic imagination. Moreover Shakespeare spent enough time on and behind the stage to know what plays and what layssomething well beyond the ken of Orloff and Emmerich. Like Crazy Directed by Drake Doremus. PG-13.

Shakespeare or not Shakespeare -- thats been a roiling unsettling question among generations of literary scholars investigating the true authorship of the plays and poems typically attributed to the Bard. ""Not"" is unequivocally the answer in ""Anonymous"" a handsomely staged and decidedly straight-ahead costume drama under Roland Emmerichs nearly CGI-free direction that insists that our ""Shakespeare"" is actually Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford. Pic is likely to encounter commercial headwinds faced by any historical movie but may get a lift from press accounts of inevitable controversy when classicists and others protest. The so-called ""Oxfordian theory"" propounded in ""Anonymous"" that Oxford actually wrote the opus we know as Shakespeares has been circulating for some 90 years but remains a distinctly minority view aggressively promoted and more frequently debunked. Indeed one can view ""Anonymous"" is as an illustrated argument of the theory pointing out several ways in which Oxfords life matched events and details alluded to or directly referenced in several Shakespearean plays particularly ""Hamlet."" From a cultural standpoint the film has received the implicit endorsement of two of the worlds most notable Shakespearean actors and directors Derek Jacobi first seen at the films start dashing into a Broadway theater to deliver the prologue and epilogue of a play titled ""Anonymous""; and Mark Rylance seen here as a lowly actor superbly performing several roles on the Globe stage such as Richard III. Their participation along with that of Vanessa Redgrave in a deeply felt performance as an aged and vexed Queen Elizabeth I lend the movie bona fides that will make the ongoing debate more interesting. The film as a whole isnt quite as interesting though it is noteworthy that action specialist Emmerich has clearly decided to change course here from anything hes previously made. Although this is primarily a writers film with John Orloffs screenplay (and dialogue) placed front and center ""Anonymous"" surprises with how classical staid and traditional Emmerichs mise-en-scene is never straying from tried-and-true costumer standards. Another playwright the unlucky Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) is captured by royal troops who torch the Globe and apparently with it an important manuscript Jonson has been hiding. Hes tortured by Elizabeths aide the hunchbacked Puritan official Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg) who demands to know if Oxford actually wrote the plays attributed to reputedly illiterate Globe actor William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall). Five years earlier Oxford (Rhys Ifans) attends Globe performances and behind the scenes discusses with the younger Earl of Essex (Sebastian Reid) the possibility of the crown being usurped by the hated Cecils including Robert and his domineering father William (David Thewlis). The remainder of Orloffs script shifts between the ""present"" Elizabethan time period and a gentler past when young Elizabeth (an ideally cast and effective Joely Richardson) takes great pleasure in the delightful plays by the young Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower) such as ""A Midsummer Nights Dream."" While Oxford is clearly a gifted poet and author hes under the thumb of William a strict Puritan who considers art and poetry to be the work of the devil. Elizabeth though a supporter of the arts is compelled to have the Cecils at her side for their connections to money power and influence. Pic strains under the constant switches in time signature which are sometimes dramatically effective and revealing of character and other times overworked and fussy. There are even occasions when inattentive viewers may not immediately grasp which part of the Elizabethan era is being depicted so quick and constant are some of the temporal changes. The past however helps explain the present which is that Oxford -- whose younger self carried on a torrid romance with the Queen and even the film speculates fathered her child -- finds himself in an uphill battle to convince Elizabeth that Robert is poisoning the aged Queens mind. Meanwhile a parallel narrative of Jonson and Shakespeares running battle over public claim of the plays authorship proves tiresome even as it veers close to comedy. The Shakespeare-Jonson imbroglio seems superfluous to everything affecting Oxford partly because Ifans command of his scenes -- and of the film -- presents convincing evidence he is ""Shakespeare"" sometimes via a mere glint of the eye or cock of the head. The actor builds his performance on details such as the way he fondles his precious manuscripts which lend the ""Oxfordian theory"" an unexpectedly human dimension. Redgrave (recently in ""Coriolanus"") veritably glows in most of her scenes as an Elizabeth who continues to wield extraordinary independent (and Protestant) power in a Catholic-dominated Europe but who knows her days are drawing short. When her Queen nears death the actor suggests that the light is literally fading in her eyes. The supporting cast is delicious including Hogg as a disturbingly chalky Robert Armesto as a stressed and insecure Jonson and Thewlis as a crafty old William under lots of makeup. Unfortunately hammy and counterproductive Spalls Shakespeare is often so ridiculous that the ""Stratfordians"" (proponents of Shakespeare being the actual author) will feel doubly insulted here. Jacobi makes a distinctly sharp impression as the introducer. Pic displays the production values of work done at Germanys Studio Babelsberg by an almost entirely Teuton crew. Especially of note is Sebastian Krawinkels ambitious and gorgeous production design ranging from moody Royal court settings and manor house interiors to a full-blown rendering of the Globe which is shown in unprecedented detail. Anna J. Foersters widescreen lensing is intensely burnished and elegant; an ordinary score by Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser isnt up to the same standard.

Daily Edition Login to download Anonymous Toronto Review 148 PM PDT 9/9/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Columbia TriStar Marketing Group A rousing but historically dubious conspiracy theory about who really wrote Shakespeares plays enlivened by superb acting and Roland Emmerichs most restrained direction ever. TWITTER Roland Emmerich brings Shakespeares London to vivid life in this early 17th century conspiracy theory with a large and superb British cast Lionized in Shakespeare in Love the Bard takes one on the chin in Anonymous a movie that portrays him as an illiterate buffoon barely smart enough to fool Elizabeths London into thinking he actually wrote all those plays and sonnets. No indeed in this movie young Will is a mere front for the noble Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford one of the more twisted characters in English history but alas a decent poet who has long had his adherents as the true author of Hamlet et al. Of course others line up behind Christopher Marlowe Francis Bacon Queen Elizabeth herself and perhaps even the stable boy at the Globe Theater. Anyone but Shakespeare This is all historical rubbish but lets allow scholars pick to pieces John Orloffsscreenplay which deals with the worst sort of unsubstantiated Elizabethan gossip outright fabrications and warped facts to support this theory. As for the movie itself surprisingly this is easily director Roland Emmerichsbest film. Instead of blowing up the world or engaging in other sorts of mass destruction he actually steers a coherent path through a complex bit of Tudor history while establishing a highly credible atmosphere of paranoia and intrigue. His British actors deliver their usual reliable performances while designers and digital environmentalist stunningly re-create Elizabethan London right down to the tiniest detail. Okay so youre in an alternate historical reality but the movie is glorious fun even as it grows increasingly implausible. No one is better than British actors at planting tongues in checks and yet giving their all to performances that teeters on the absurd. Rhys Ifansdoes a smart and yes noble turn as Oxford who initiates a political intrigue with his secretly authored plays only to find himself at the center of a Greek tragedy. David Thewlisas Elizabeths key advisor William Cecil and Edward Hoggas his hunchback son and successor Robert are political insiders incarnate They probably could find a self-interested motive for going to the loo. It sounds like stunt casting but the mother-daughter team of Vanessa Redgrave andJoely Richardson playing the aging and much younger Bess works to perfection. You might quarrel with the movies interpretation of this great historical figure but not with her enactors. They are splendid. Much of the focus of this very plot-driven film falls on Sebastian Armesto who plays Wills fellow playwright Ben Jonson here cast as a most reluctant go-between in the conspiracy behind ""Shakespeare"" and indeed Oxfords initial pick to front for him. Ben grumbles about this to a ham actor in his company a guy named Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall in a myth-shattering comic performance). Will is a dim light but bright enough to seize the opportunity to take on the role himself as Ben has his own reputation as a playwright to protect. One of the films many historical problems is that it wants the fake authorship to play the key role in the Essex Rebellion of 1601 where the ""fantastic earls"" Essex (Sam Reid) and to a lesser degree Southhampton (Xavier Samuel) engaged in a foolhardy though brief coup detat that lead to Essexs beheading. But ""Shakespeare"" started producing plays at least eight years prior to that moment. Plus the key persuasive fact presented by the film to back up its conspiracy claim is that Oxford presented ""his"" play Richard III with its hunchback villain to mock Robert Cecil just before the Rebellion. The problem is the play was actually Richard II. Oops. Nevertheless the film grabs at historical facts mangles them into a plot worthy of a John le Carre spy novel and takes the viewer on a breathtaking ride through ye olde London. Especially splendid are the aerial shots of that depict that eras town with the accuracy of John Stow the citys first great surveyor. The river city seemingly dwells in permanent midnight as darkness settles over the town at all hours and everything is poorly lit. From the bear-baiting rings crowded theaters filthy streets and the royal court with its black-and-white finery this is one of the best historical depictions of Elizabeths London yet. Surprisingly it does get the theatrical presentations wrong showing them at night lit by torches when in fact they were always performed in the afternoon. But the staging itself is brilliantly done conveying the interaction between declaiming actors and the ""groundlings"" in the pit an audience that is literally part of the performance. (Most doubtful however is the creation of rain on stage from overhead sprinklers.) The coming and goings of opportunistic courtiers in Elizabeths palaces the movement of poets peasants whores and cut-purses in and about city streets the citys love for conflict and conspiracy -- all this feels absolutely right. The upshot of all the intrigue comes in a line delivered toward the end by Robert Cecil. He declares that the Tudors ""show strange tastes in bedfellows."" And that is the nub of the argument believe it or not that the Virgin Queen dropped so many bastards all over England that even she -- and the sons -- lost count. As far as who wrote the grandest immortal lines in the history of the English language lets give Shakespeare the last word ""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.""
