Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Forget April. January is the cruelest month for moviegoers. Nobody in the picture business is bringing forth lilies to enliven the poets ""dead land."" While everyones attention is fixed on the Oscar nominations its the moment for cheesy slasher epics and the reluctant release of last years failed genre effort movies that may mix ""memory and desire"" but only in the most unappetizing ways. OK Ill drop the T.S. Eliot references. But only if you promise not to waste your time and money on -- oh lets say Smokin Aces. Its possible that in some half-forgotten pitch meeting someone murmured the phrase ""black comedy"" in describing their intentions for the movie. It is also possible that names like Scorsese or Tarantino or the Coen brothers were bandied about in that conclave. But what they meant to say was ""blood bath."" The situation is that a mob hit has been ordered on a drug-addled Las Vegas magician/informer. Competing hit teams -- bounty hunters neo-Nazis a pair of deadly lesbian ladies -- turn up to compete for the million dollars on offer for completing the job. The FBI of course is attempting to protect the man they hope is going to be their star witness. Pretty soon everyone get to killing everyone else. You have quite possibly never seen so much unedifying mayhem in a relatively confined space the smallest of which is a hotel elevator in which two guys pump uncounted bullets into one another at point blank range. Hmm one muses -- never seen that before. But thats the full extent of writer-director Joe Carnahans originality. And since he never bothers to establish why we should care about any of his characters we just sit there numbly awaiting the next sensation and trying without notable success to comprehend the preposterous backstory -- dating back decades -- with which it is lackadaisically equipped. Seraphim Falls has one of those too. There must be some reason why in the winter snows of the Wests high country a band of marauders led by Carver (Liam Neeson) is expending such implacable efforts to wipe out Gideon (Pierce Brosnan). By the time the chase has descended to the deserts burning sands we learn that the latter was a once-peaceful farmer whose family was wiped out by Civil War irregulars led by Neeson (shades of the much better outlaw Josie Wales). Gideon will have his vengeance if possible Carver will defend himself by relentlessly attacking him. But the lone victim is a clever cuss and succeeds in wiping out all of his pursuers save Carver. The fleeing and fighting is intermittently interesting but one is more interested frankly in why Anjelica Huston suddenly intrudes on the film selling patent medicine and vague spirituality. Also in why the near-moribund western genre suddenly reappears in this rather austere if handsomely mounted form. It is the kind of movie that gets you thinking not so much about its ostensible subject but about how difficult it must have been for director and co-writer David Von Ancken to make -- toting all that production gear up into the waist-deep snows plunging Brosnan (or his stunt double) into the eponymous falls while wearing a fur coat that must weigh 20 pounds even before it becomes soaking wet. It is not a terrible movie -- its beginning holds a certain promise -- just finally an unengaging one. Which grants it a certain kinship with Catch and Release a romantic non-comedy -- its really more in the mode of an old-fashioned ""womens picture"" -- in which a woman named Gray Wheeler (Jennifer Garner) finds her wedding day turning into a funeral for her fiance suddenly lost in an accident. For reasons best known to her she continues to hang around his bachelor bungalow in Boulder Colorado mourning his passing with two former roommate (Kevin Smith and Sam Jaeger) and a visiting pal named Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) who turns out to be much nicer than he first appears to be. They learn that the fiance was perhaps a tad less ideal than Gray thought him to be -- a massage therapist from Los Angeles (Juliette Lewis) arrives with a son all are convinced was fathered by Grays lost love. You can make a comedy on almost any subject -- as Preston Sturges (and even Mel Brooks) have proved. But theres no spark in this one. And no sparkle in Garners playing. Shes an attractive young woman but her energy is low and her mood is endlessly wistful. Olyphant seems more of a male model than an actor and the writer-director Susannah Grant does not know how to stir her actors up comedically or romantically. Its an odd thing. Back when men directed womens pictures they throbbed with energy perhaps because female behavior was such an enigma to them perhaps because actresses like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were so headlong so committed to the emotional extremes. You might not in the end believe them but boy they were gripping to watch. Directors like Grant or Nancy Meyers (of The Holiday among other titles) want to keep their leading ladies unhysteric as if descents into the irrational were somehow fuel for sexism. But the politely furrowed brow is fundamentally anti-dramatic. You want people in films like this to rip and snort their way to improbable but somehow satisfying resolutions. Unless of course youre content to have your convictionless genre picture dumped into January release. Meantime the viewers eye wanders toward the calendar -- only five more days till February only another month until the Oscar hype disappears overnight. Only a couple of months until we begin faintly to hear the first drumbeats for the big spring and summer releases. Theyll mostly be pretty awful too. But at least someone will believe in them. Or pretend to.

With Jeremy Piven Ben Affleck Andy Garcia. Director Joe Carnahan (148). R Violence language nudity drug use. At area theaters. Joe Carnahans obsession with outdoing Quentin Tarantinos violent pulp fictions has gone from jittery impersonation (""Blood Guts Bullets and Octane"") to relatively controlled mayhem (""Narc"") to outright delusional nuttiness with his latest ""Smokin Aces."" This guy is going to make a good movie if he ever gets some help - a ""be-yourself"" pep talk from Dr. Phil say. Or maybe an autographed 8-by-10 photo from Tarantino would do it. Theres no question Carnahan has an eye for composition an ear for dialogue and a sense of pace that if put to better use could make an audience beg for relief. But the characters in ""Smokin Aces"" are about as lifelike as the occupants of vehicles destroyed in a car-safety test. The crash-test dummies here are the slew of contract killers trying to collect a 1 million bounty for mob-connected cokehead Las Vegas headliner Buddy Israel (Jeremy Piven) whos about to turn rat and enter the federal witness protection program. Andy Garcia heads the FBI team Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds are his crack investigators Ben Affleck is a bail bondsman trying to save a lawyers investment and Alicia Keys shows up as a hottie assassin who trash-talks with her partner (Taraji P. Henson) in exactly the same manner as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction."" With the exception of Garcia the performances are as over the top as the script. Its as if the actors were told to create their own characters - the broader the better - and let em go whether they were interesting (not often) real (never) or plain silly (often). Violence is spread throughout the film and some of it is entertaining I have to admit. But the climax at Buddys Tahoe penthouse is Tarantino on speed. Buddys coke addiction is sad but its nothing compared to Carnahans dependence on Q.T.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Obscene Zone A flawed movie about a deeply flawed war. Plus a film that almost rehabilitates Ralph Naders image. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Shadow Distribution) The Situation is a fictional film depicting the circus of horrors that is present-day Iraq and when it works (sporadically) it calls to mind the so-called Pottery Barn rule the Colin Powell admonishment to George W. Bush on the eve of the invasion You break it you own it. In the hands of the director Philip Haas Iraq four years on is like a Pottery Barn pulverized by Hurricane Katrina. The movie catches the mood of the best recent journalismthe visceral feeling that as one character puts it a box has been opened and all the bad things have come out. It makes you realize there isnt enough money in the world to pay for breakage like this. The film opens with a war crime A U.S. patrol encounters a pair of Iraqi teens on a Samarra bridge after curfew; the soldiers taunt the boys shove them and end up chucking them into the waterwhere one of them drowns. The incident brings intrepid American reporter Anna Molyneux (Connie Nielsen) sniffing aroundalthough sniffing is a challenge when youre buried under a hijab for fear of having your throat cut. Beyond her conflicting political loyalties Anna is torn between two loversone a prim American intelligence officer (Damian Lewis) who stays put in the Green Zone and argues logistics with a mulish colonel (John Slattery) the other a stud- muffin Iraqi photographer (Mido Hamada) who plunges into melees with camera clicking heroically. BACKSTORYIt seems the Iraq war is finally working to someones benefitthe Moroccan film industrys. Hollywood is churning out Middle East dramasand Iraq is well Iraqso directors are turning to Morocco to sub in for war-torn desert locations. In The Situation Philip Haas used the capital Rabat as a stand-in for Baghdad. Other made-in-Morocco films include Irwin Winklers Home of the Brave Paul Haggiss upcoming The Valley of Elah and Kimberly Peirces untitled project starring Ryan Phillippe as a soldier fighting the U.S. government. The country has also of course appeared in such classics as Lawrence of Arabia. The Situation is to put it kindly a spotty piece of work. The script is by Wendell Steavenson a reporter who seems to know everything about Iraq and next to nothing about screenwriting. The dialogue is flat and the actors almost never rise above it. Major plotlinesthe crime on the bridge for instancedrift to the periphery. You can almost hear the editor pulling out his hair as he cuts from one droopy overexpository conversation to the next. My favorite eye-rolling moment is when a U.S. official explains to Anna the rationale for the occupationThe key to the region is a friendly Iraq to give us leverage over Syria and Iran and on cue theres a boom And a rat-a-tat Does that sound friendly to you? asks Anna. No just clunky. What grabs you isnt the movies foreground with its too-chewy musings. (There is no truth you know There are no bad guys and no good guys The truth shifts according to each person you talk to.) Its the otherworldly panoramathe bewildering range of conflicting interests the ubiquitousness of destruction and death the confusion over who exactly is shooting at whom. Collaborating fruitlessly on a water-treatment plant American soldiers snicker at the uselessness of the Iraqis while the Iraqis malign the cluelessness of Americans. A bow-tied little American slug speaks confidently of democracy by force while his countrymen seek out one anothers company at Green Zone pool parties. For Rafeeq (Nasser Memarzia) a levelheaded moderate (The world must stop thinking that were religious fanatics) theres no way to win Hell either be recruited by the insurgents and targeted by the Americans or vice versa. Theres a casualness about the carnageand yet the keening of Iraqi women over their loved ones mutilated bodies rips you up. The Situation was shot in Morocco not that youd (or at least Id) notice. If the lines didnt throw you out of the picture the movie might pass for a docudrama. That said the dialogue never reaches heights of surrealism like this from 60 Minutes Scott Pelley Do you think you owe the Iraqi people an apology for not doing a better job? George W. Bush That we didnt do a better job or they didnt do a better job? And then Bush [Americans] wonder whether or not there is a gratitude level thats significant enough in Iraq. Pelley Americans wonder whether Bush Yeah they wonder whether or not the Iraqis are willing to do hard work. That kind of exchange accounts for my reply to an invitation to see the new documentary An Unreasonable Man and to meet its subject Ralph Nader. I wrote I couldnt make it but to leave my seat vacant in the name of the Iraqi and American dead. Now Ive seen the movie and Im sorry to have been so snotty. Nader was obviously nuts to assert that there wasnt a dimes bit of difference between Bush and Al Gore. But the film directed by Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan does a brilliant job of putting his 2000 run for president in contextto show how consistent it was with everything he has stood for in his remarkable career. What makes An Unreasonable Man so compelling is its perfectly fluid line. Simply put the private Nader and the public Nader are the same There are no contradictions with which to grapple no byways to explore. The son of a Lebanese immigrant who talked politics at his diner and dinner table Nader went after the automobile companies when a friend was paralyzed in a crashand rocketed to national prominence as a result of being tailed and harassed by General Motors. GMs settlement ended up bankrolling Naders Raiders which accomplished things thatgiven the current tortoiselike legislative climatemake ones jaw drop. OSHA the Clean Air Act the Freedom of Information Acttheres Nader leading the charge. A former Raider points out that if Nader had a fraction of Donald Trumps grandiosity (or money) his name would be on every seat belt. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"Smokin Aces No deal | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSmokin Aces No dealThe title the poster and the slam-bam trailer suggest a movie about a crack team of professional troublemakers and problem-solvers in the vein of Mission Impossible Oceans 11 and 12 Quentin Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs and Guy Ritchies Snatch. No such luck.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 26 2007  (out of 4)Starring Ben Affleck Andy Garcia Alicia Keys Ray Liotta Jeremy Piven and Ryan Reynolds. Written and directed by Joe Carnahan. 108 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  Article Continued BelowAll set-up and no satisfaction Smokin Aces is as dishonest as it is dire.The title the poster and the slam-bam trailer suggest a movie about a crack team of professional troublemakers and problem-solvers in the vein of Mission Impossible Oceans 11 and 12 Quentin Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs and Guy Ritchies Snatch. No such luck. You have to parse the title using the street lingo that writer/director Joe Carnahan is inordinately fond of. Then you realize youve been had by a filmmaker who has seen all those above-named movies and only wants to copy them. Carnahan doesnt have influences; he has Xeroxes. ""Aces"" refers not to a team but to Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) an implausibly popular Vegas magician and showman who moonlights as a mobster wannabe.Aces run afoul of real gangsters chiefly aging mob boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin) who doesnt appreciate the trampling on his turf or the suggestion that the wannabe is about to become an informer for the FBI.Sparazza wants to ""smoke"" Aces and hes offering 1 million to the hitman or hitwoman who can pull it off. The prize perks the ears and itches the trigger fingers of hired guns the world over who flock to the Lake Tahoe hotel where Aces is holed up impatiently waiting for the FBI to get its act together.A great deal of the movie is spent introducing us to the colourful array of hard men and hot mamas who want to score by making Aces cash his chips. They include two foxy and ferocious sistas (Alicia Keys and Taraji Henson) straight out of a blaxploitation flashback; three psychopathic neo-Nazi siblings (Chris Pine Kevin Durand Maury Serling) who dress and act like the Village People auditioning for a Saw sequel; a Vegas bail bondsman (Ben Affleck) and his two knuckleheaded assistants (Martin Henderson Peter Berg); a master torturer (Nestor Carbonell); and a jack-of-all-disguises (Tommy Flanagan).On the side of the law sort of are two FBI agents (Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta) who are under the command of FBI Deputy Director Stanley Locke (Andy Garcia).Right away you can see whats wrong. Carnahan has larded so many characters into his script theres precious little he can do with it apart from parading everybody in front of the camera and unleashing a sickening amount of violence. And since none of them really seem to know each other -- until they start banging into each other -- theres no fun to be had with old rivals seeking to settle scores or simply to one-up each other. Smokin Aces is simply no fun at all.This is from the same Joe Carnahan who impressed mightily with his Sundance hit Narc from 2002 starring Ray Liotta and Jason Patric in a tale of murder and police corruption that was lean focussed and spellbinding -- everything that Smokin Aces isnt. What the hell happened? By the time Carnahan has introduced his circus of sleaze and allowed everyone to make their little speeches and demonstrations of murderous prowess weve lost all interest in the object of their obsessions.Especially since Pivens Aces is such a jerk who insults everyone he meets and who treats women as chattle.

Photo ... more Photo Photo Credit Jaimie Trueblood Always something going on in clever over-the-top Vegas thriller 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Smokin Aces Starring Jeremy Piven Ray Liotta Ben Affleck and Andy Garcia. Directed by Joe Carnahan. (Rated R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Joe Carnahan is a writer-director whose first film the self- produced ""Blood Guts Bullets and Octane"" announced the arrival of a fully formed talent. He stumbled with his first big-budget feature ""Narc"" a nihilistic incoherent thriller but hes back with ""Smokin Aces"" which is even more nihilistic and confused than ""Narc"" and yet a lot better. Its better for some specific and interesting reasons. [Podcast Mick LaSalle Affleck finally picks a decent role.] Carnahan lays out in the movies first minutes an ambitious story involving an obnoxious Vegas entertainer Buddy Israel (Jeremy Piven) whom everyone wants to kill. Mobsters have a price on his head because hes ratting them out to the government. Other mob factions want to kill him because ... well just because. I dont have it all worked out yet. But there are lots of characters three punks with Mohawks and bad teeth wielding flamethrowers and chainsaws. A female assassin (Alicia Keys) and her partner. A bail bondsmen (Ben Affleck) and his buddies. A Swedish assassin (Vladimir Kulich) known as ""the Swede"" of all things. And an austere-looking bald assassin (Tommy Flanagan). They all want to kill Buddy and I think they might all want to kill one another in order to be the one to kill Buddy but Im not sure why. Oh yes and theres another assassin too a smooth-talking guy with a mustache. Hes working for somebody too. So three-quarters of the cast are contract killers. The rest are feds headed by Andy Garcia a fiery actor who has found an odd cinematic niche playing cold emotionless and untrustworthy men of power and influence. Hes the boss and he wants to prevent Buddy from being killed. He puts his best man (Ray Liotta) on the case. Does this sound like a mess? Well it is a mess. Yet either by design instinct or luck Carnahan comes up with a way to make this overly complicated movie very simple. He does it with an appropriately simple device. He has Buddy rent a suite in a Las Vegas hotel and stay there the entire picture. That means that even though there are too many characters to follow and too many motives to keep track of we always know where everybodys headed and we always basically know whats going on. Theyre heading to Vegas to the top floor of that hotel. If theyre wearing a tie they want to save Buddy. And if theyre wearing anything else including a Mohawk or hot pants they want to kill him. With that settled the audience is able to enjoy all the other things that Carnahan can do -- his inquisitive camera work his witty dialogue and his skill at drawing idiosyncratic characters with a minimum of flourishes. Piven fares especially well as the sweaty mobster wannabe the essence of the obnoxious Vegas entertainer narcissistic fast-talking and not nearly as clever powerful or tough as he pretends. Keys also gets a good showcase Shes not only beautiful but she also has an exceptional speaking voice low and gritty and full of sly fatalism. Carnahan creates a spectacle of nihilism with a number of scenes of carnage including a shootout in an elevator. This vision is no mere gesture as it is for say Guy Ritchie. Here and there one gets the impression that what we see onscreen is the product of some turbulence within the filmmaker. That makes it interesting. Still I doubt this is the extent of what Carnahan can do as an artist -- I think he has more to offer. In the meantime ""Smokin Aces"" has humor and flash and theres always something going on. -- Advisory Strong violence gore dismemberment harsh language and nudity.

"Overdone `Aces You cant look away -- but you should - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Buddy Overdone `Aces You cant look away -- but you shouldJanuary 26 2007|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticSmokin Aces is like that 60-car pileup you see on the interstate.Its vulgar and uncouth to look but you have to stop and gawk. You cant believe the number of people in it. You cant fathom the carnage the body count.And you cant believe that Andy Garcia in a drawl that comes and goes at will didnt hear the humor or the irony in his own line near the finale -- ""Do you want your career to end here? Now?""Its a movie of obscene excesses comically overdone complications and performances pitched right on the edge of hysteria. Some of these mistakes appear to be intentional. Writer-director Joe Carnahan apparently took his good notices for the minimalist and fast-moving Narc too seriously and overshot and overedited a ""look-at-how-many-balls-I-can-juggle"" script that lured everyone from Ben Affleck to Alicia Keys to sign on.Much to their embarrassment.Aces opens with an exhausting 15 minutes of narrated flashbacks and back story various characters spinning the yarn of how an aging Mafia don (""He runs La Cosa Nostra on the West Coast"" were told maybe 22 times) has put out a hit on a popular Vegas magician Buddy ""Aces"" Israel.Buddy is a jerk. Buddy wants to be ""connected."" Buddy is a sleazeball. Buddy is a snitch. Buddy is a cokehead. How could Jeremy Piven suddenly so hot from TVs Entourage resist playing him?Theres a 1 million bounty on Buddys head. A guy he crossed wants his heart delivered to him ""old-school Sicilian.""Theres a mysterious ""Swede"" on his way to get Buddy. A couple of ex-cops and a bail bondsman (Affleck) want to collect the Buddy bounty first. A pair of lesbian hit women (pop singer Keys and Taraji Henson) are on the case. Two lone psychos will make their moves (Tommy Flanagan Pasqual LaCosta).A family of psycho-skinhead rednecks the Three Tremors (get it?) want that money.And the FBI (Ray Liotta Ryan Reynolds) led by a Southern-fried Garcia need to get to Aces first to put him in the witness protection program.Carnahan piles excess on excess as the body count rises famous faces are killed off for comic effect and everything and everyone converges on a Lake Tahoe hotel penthouse where Buddy is going through cocaine and hookers like theres a fire sale.Piven reaches for a bracing abrasiveness as Buddy flicking through an ever-present deck of cards abusing himself and everyone around him. He has run through this batch of prostitutes. He wants more.""These flowers have wilted. Call the florist.""Liotta and Reynolds try to manage some Tarantino-esque banter that sounds written rather than thought up on the spot.The neo-Nazi hit men the Tremors are the funniest in a Road Warrior sort of way. But the lesbian hit-women (Henson in particular) have the best lines slangy ethnic and ""street.""""Someone gon dead this fool.""Still you have to wonder if deep in their darkest places way too many actors relish the thought of playing somebody so venal amoral indulgent violent with catchphrase-filled dialogue that they lose track of what they should be reading a script for -- clarity cohesion intelligence. This one had semi-clever twists all lost in the hundred characters-hundred back stories-hundred narrators of the telling.Carnahan given a real budget and a huge cast pretty much wallows in it. Putting Ben Affleck and the poor mans Ben Affleck Ryan Reynolds in the same movie? Not a good move. Carnahan indulgently gives many supporting players facial blemishes -- moles boils zits and on funny Jason Bateman (as a cowardly lawyer) a cold sore.Why? Hes like the director of Lucky Number Slevin fretting over filming visually distracting wallpaper when he should have been streamlining his story.Its a real pileup of a movie Pulp Fiction on speed. There are giggles in its little flourishes the over-the-top acting turns (a Ritalin-racked karate-kid wannabe who is hysterical). One big shoot-out might take your breath away.But staring at a road accident isnt the same as being entertained by one. And either way youll feel guilty about it later.

Common plays a Sir Ivy the bodyguard. Photo UniversalPictures Smokin Aces 1 / 2 Back to Gallery If you saw the trailer for Smokin Aces you would be forgiven for thinking it must be an incoherent slobbering mess. You would be forgiven because you would be correct. Smokin Aces has done something I didnt think possible It has made Alpha Dog look like Oscar fodder. It has pushed that abusive exercise from the low-rise pedestal reserved for the worst movie of the year (at least so far). And it threatens to wipe from the minds of admiring cinephiles the memory of Narc writer-director Joe Carnahans sharp breakout cop thriller. The narrative innovation behind Smokin Aces is its lack of a protagonist. I dont mean the lack of a sympathetic protagonist or a strong antagonist or an Aristotelian tragic hero in the mold of Hamlet or Tommy Lee. It has no protagonist at all. Every single character piled onto this scrum is a supporting player -- although that implies there might be something to support and there isnt unless you ponder Jason Bateman in a thong. Bateman looks chipper. He plays a wasted weirdo lawyer one of many wasted weirdos populating Smokin Aces. He also plays one of the few people who dont die somewhere along the line as the movie makes a big point of introducing colorful characters (identified in subtitles a popular gimmick these days) for the express purpose of popping them off. Its like Ten Little Ducks with really big guns. Or Jackson Pollock flinging chopped bits of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie onto his canvas instead of paint. The story concerns sleazebag Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) a mob-connected Vegas magician-turned-FBI-snitch whos poised to bring down a dying mafioso named Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin). Israels been holed up for weeks in a palatial Lake Tahoe penthouse when the feds get wind of a mob hit a million bucks for anyone who whacks Israel and cuts out his heart. The contract on Israel who splits his time between card tricks and operatic crying jags turns into a cattle call for hit men and peripheral eccentrics a bail bondsman and a couple of ex-cops (Ben Affleck Peter Berg and Martin Henderson); a pair of demigoddess assassins (Taraji Henson and Alicia Keys); a goon with burnt fingertips (Nestor Carbonell); a master of latex disguise (Tommy Flanagan); and a trio of wasted weirdo Nazi brothers (Kevin Durand Maury Sterling Chris Pine). Andy Garcia plays the FBI honcho in charge of two agents portrayed by Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds who head for Tahoe and discover a bloodbath. At times characters sob uncontrollably to the accompaniment of lachrymose strings. At times I too wanted to sob uncontrollably over the squandering of talent and stage blood. One scene holds promise. In it a Nazi thug walks over to Afflecks corpse. He reaches down gently clasps that manly jaw and moves his mouth open and shut assuming the dead mans voice. ""I forgive you"" he says. Cute isnt it? Almost as cute as the scene with the chopped fingers and the car keys. And almost as touching as the scene with another hit man leaning over the form of yet another dying nimrod as he strokes his head and talks him quietly to heaven. Its ludicrous but not as ludicrous as the ending -- an exhausting game of Twister thatll leave you feeling stupid or cheated or both. The first revelation is bizarre the second is obvious while the third contradicts the first two. As for the fourth it reveals the movie as an abysmal waste of time.

"Smokin Aces deals out violence in spades - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Smokin Aces deals out violence in spades By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 26 2007 What are we to do with ""Smokin Aces"" ? A first impulse is to give this alarmingly trigger-happy movie a bath. Jeremy Piven  playing a magician-turned-gangster spends nearly every scene in a cold sweat with dark dilated eyes that make him look like an anime cokehead. (A bath would wash off that horrendous hairpiece too.) And is there any room in the tub for Ben Affleck as a bail bondsman with a Windy City brogue or the trio of oversexed backwoods Nazis or the Ritalin-fueled karate kid who seems like an escapee from ""Gummo"" ? This movie would leave several rings around any bathtub.More to the point Joe Carnahans shoot-em-up is an unreasonable provocation. It teases us with action-movie frivolity then rubs our noses in grisly bloodletting all in the service of a plot hinging on a million-dollar bounty for Buddy ""Aces"" Israel . Buddy is about to rat out his Cosa Nostra mentor for the FBI which has placed him under witness protection. At least four different cash-hungry mob factions plan to find Buddy in his federally protected sky suite at a Tahoe luxury palace shoot him and rip out his heart per his affronted mentors instructions.Sadly more than an hour of this movie is given over to talking. And not the wink-wink Quentin Tarantino kind either. There are no sweet observations of the mundane. The characters speak in clumps of exposition. Its like being at a table reading for some pulp series whose first installments weve missed. The feds the hired guns the bails bondsmen all fill us in by filling each other in.Some of the talkers include a clothed and almost-human Ryan Reynolds as a fed; as his partner Ray Liotta  who was so scary in Carnahans previous movie ""Narc""; an excellently hopped-up Jason Bateman as a kinky yuppie; and the rapper and Gap pitchman Common  who as one of Buddys bodyguards contributes a smoldering menace thats the hottest thing in the movie. Despite a few of these people and because of others at some point youre all talked out and eager for something to happen. The movie flirts with kitsch blaxploitation  and camp but Carnahan nudges things along without much of a bark. Where oh where is the foaming Rottweiler relentlessness of ""Narc""?Well its waiting in the last 50 or so minutes where the competing sides of this film are sucked toward a grisly hotel climax like debris into a vacuum bag. The plot is a little ""True Romance"" with a twist of ""The Usual Suspects."" But really ""Smokin Aces"" is the junkyard cousin of Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans"" movies the first of which was set in Vegas hotels. (They also have a terrible Andy Garcia in common.) Soderberghs capers are action movies where wit stands in for violence. The violence in ""Smokin Aces"" stands in for wit. The characters are interesting only when they aim to kill.And in that hotel sequence the mayhem feels disturbingly like combat. In a hotel across the way the fabulous Taraji P. Henson (that singing hooker from ""Hustle amp; Flow"") sits behind one of the biggest guns Ive ever seen. It stands on a tripod and when she uses it to cover her girlfriend and co-hit-lady (an icy Alicia Keys ) her targets are flung across hallways. Theres a shoot-out where the spray of bullets make an elevator look like a strobe-lit disco number from ""Dreamgirls."" And the wild Nazis wield their chainsaws and cutlery with obligatory glee.In this sequence ""Smokin Aces"" becomes appalling perhaps intentionally rival factions competing to take out a man conveniently -- or perhaps just carelessly -- named Israel? Its not an allegory for war. Its a version of the real thing. Yet watching the mad abandon of the combatants and the modernity of the artillery its impossible not to think of the bellicose factions in the Middle East.The movie isnt exactly smart. Nor is it stupid. Were meant to take the brutality seriously. Blood is spilled and tears are shed over it. But like too many Hollywood directors Carnahan seems to get a charge from staging destruction. That hotel sequence is sexy filmmaking All the movies panache comes barreling out.When its over the pointlessness of the carnage becomes the movies backhanded point. You might even ask Irresponsible action flick or treatise on the futility of war? But since the moral underpinnings dont stick these are bogus questions. The bang is strictly for a buck.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 25 2007 546 PM Men With Guns The absurdly macho pyrotechnics of Smokin Aces. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about Smokin Aces by clicking the arrow on the player below You can also click here  to download the MP3 file. Common and Jeremy Piven in Smokin Aces Joe Carnahan please put down the gun (and the flamethrower and the suitcase full of mysterious torture implements) and back away slowly from the movie camera. Four years ago you scored a modest hit with Narc a tightly plotted if ultimately empty buddy-cop-betrayal drama starring Ray Liotta and Jason Patric. Smokin Aces a cameo-crammed action comedy with a strangely maudlin twist ending is another fable about the perils of ratting out your friends and the joys of riding shotgun with Liotta. But its less Narc II than a throwback to the title of your first ultra-low-budget feature Blood Guts Bullets and Octane. Except for the octane part Smokin Aces is awash in ammo and carnage but it chugs to the finish line with a tank full of sludge. The films first act is faux Tarantino with a huge cast of quirky hit men and down-on-their-luck lowlifes trading insults as they brief one another on a million-dollar mob hit. (Despite this sections rapid-fire dialogue and dizzying introduction of new characters--approximately one per minute--the setup takes a good 20 minutes of screen time.) In the second act these assorted teams of bail bondsmen neo-Nazi rednecks and lovable lesbian assassins converge on Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) a Vegas magician-turned-mobster holed up in a Lake Tahoe casino penthouse. Buddy has made a deal to snitch on his bosses and henchmen in exchange for the protection of two FBI agents (Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds). But the elderly don Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin) wants Buddy taken out with extreme prejudice--hes specified that whoever gets the job done should bring him the stool pigeons heart. Advertisement A gruesome Cannonball Run with Piven flesh as the trophy Smokin Aces is a depressingly nihilistic entry in the Tarantino/Guy Ritchie/Oceans Eleven caper genre. It jollies us along with gross-out man banter (""Who jizzed on my jacket?"") and lighthearted sadomasochism for three-quarters of its running time then suddenly lurches into random dramatic interludes that--if the solemn piano music is any cue--were actually supposed to care about. Most of these involve the slide into coke-addled dementia of Pivens Buddy. But given the utter absence of development or context for this character--we dont even see him do any real magic tricks--its impossible to decide whether to root for the victim or his equally uncompelling assassins. The weirdly magnetic Piven is the only reason I still watch HBOs Entourage (which Ive inveighed against here and here). Hes a mercurial actor one of the few I could imagine effecting the transition from magician to gang lord. (Isnt it always the way? One minute theyre pulling bunnies from hats the next theyre collecting protection money.) But Piven is powerless to combat the deep stupidity of this role and his performance ranges from adequate (in the comic scenes) to excruciating (in the ""tragic"" ones). At the movies puzzling dramatic nadir Buddy stares blearily into the bathroom mirror wearing a single bright-blue contact lens as a tear rolls down his cheek. I wish my insurance covered Lasik surgery too but you dont see me crying about it. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I tried to experience Smokin Aces as a wild amoral thrill ride but it feels more like a first-person shooter video game. Some of the sitting ducks include Ben Affleck as a bail bondsman with a walrus mustache and teeth like piano keys; Andy Garcia as an FBI boss with an unprecedented Southern Gothic accent; and Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson as lady assassins who also happen to be lovers. Henson who played the pregnant prostitute in Hustle amp; Flow is the movies strongest dramatic presence and Jason Bateman as a degenerate self-loathing lawyer provides the funniest two-and-a-half minutes (is there anything Jason Bateman doesnt make funnier?). But cherry-picking performances feels like a suckers game in Smokin Aces an undifferentiated heap of genre cliches that less than 48 hours after seeing it is already receding in my memory.

Smokin Aces the wild ride of a movie he scripted and directed is so pumped up manic and mayhem-packed that it practically shoots sweat off the screen. They should also check Carnahans Netflix account If he hasnt been renting Quentin Tarantino right and left then hes been channeling the Reservoir Dogs/Pulp Fiction auteur some other way. For a while until the whole thing gets too explosively exhausting for its own good this whirring bloody smash-and-grab romp is just that - a romp. There isnt much in the way of plot or characters; its more like Newtonian physics with every action triggering an equal and opposite and outrageous reaction. Various packs of feds freelancers bail bondsmen power saw-armed neo-Nazi nutballs hit men and hit ladies descend on a Lake Tahoe hotel where Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) a Vegas showman-turned-stoolie is holed up in a penthouse suite. Some want to nab Buddy and keep him safe so he can testify and others just want to wipe him off the face of the earth. Its kind of Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World except that the busy parade of stars in this case - Ben Affleck Jason Bateman Andy Garcia Alicia Keys Ray Liotta Ryan Reynolds Matthew Fox and plenty more - arent just racing for the bounty theyre also killing each other to get there first. Piven for his part paces his heavily guarded aerie nervously shuffling a deck of cards tooting coke and more coke until the paranoia oozes from his pores. Surrounded at first by a harem of hookers and by a couple of henchmen he finds his fortress in the sky is laid siege by some of the aforementioned horde and then others. The elevator banks the stairwells the windows the roof - every entrance and exit becomes a conduit for armed-to-the-teeth law enforcers and law-breakers to do their business. Talk about sitting ducks. Or a sitting magician-comedian with a foul mouth an intimate knowledge of mob dealings and a price on his head. Carnahan whose 1998 low-budget indie Blood Guts Bullets and Octane put him on the Hollywood map (he went on to make Narc) moves the pieces around with aplomb - and bombs in the air. A couple of every-which-way shootouts are impressively staged. Singer Keys making her feature debut as an assassin-for-hire in neo-Foxy Brown couture is a standout in the big busy cast. Reynolds as a true-blue FBI guy is another. But Smokin Aces is all pumped up with no place to go and the crashing letdown as the rush fades and the ammo shells lie spent across the screen is heavy indeed. Smokin Aces 1/2 (out of four stars) Produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner written and directed by Joe Carnahan photography by Mauro Fiore music by Clint Mansell distributed by Universal Pictures.

"Smokin Aces | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; smokin-aces ) Smokin Aces (United Kingdom/United States/France 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Smokin Aces is Tarantino lite - a vague and unsuccessful attempt to bring together a bunch of offbeat unrelated characters in a situation where a bloody resolution is inescapable. Like an absentminded chef however writer/director Joe Carnahan has gone into this endeavor without the full complement of ingredients and the missing ones are crucial to the final products consistency. The characters are uniformly uninteresting - a bunch of ill-defined caricatures who never attain even a semblance of identity. The undercurrent of dark humor is rarely amusing and the screenplays supposed cleverness is rarely ingenious. The setup takes too long and the resolution is a letdown. The movie demands an attentive audience to follow the diverse characters and plot threads but in the end it fails to reward that attention. The story concerns Vegas lounge performer Buddy Israel (Jeremy Piven) who has information critical to bringing down a mob boss. A 1 million price has been put on his head and killers and reprobates from all corners converge on Vegas intending to kill Israel. Two FBI agents Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta) are on the case but their efforts may be too little too late. Buddy has his own small army of protectors but they may be outmanned and outgunned by the legions of hitmen approaching his penthouse apartment. There is some good news for Buddy - since each of them wants the money they have no problem eliminating one another on the way to the prize. The implicit promise of a movie like this is that there will be a big twist at the end that leaves us smirking at the films audacity. Carnahan tries to deliver but what he comes up with is predictable low-key and unsatisfying. As the end credits begin rolling were left in the audience wondering ""Is that all?"" In a way the whole movie is like that - promising more than it delivers. Its a shell game. The movie keeps switching things up in the hope we wont notice that not much is going on. Smokin Aces offers colorful characters but none is well developed and its hard to care about anyone. Even the individuals with the most screen time - Buddy and Messner - dont come close to achieving three-dimensionality. A living cartoon (which is what Smokin Aces is) still needs a protagonist worth caring about; but this movie doesnt have that. The film takes risks. Just because a character is played by a big name doesnt mean that individual will survive for long or have a lot of screen time. A couple of the deaths are unexpected because we make assumptions about how long actors will be around. Its here that Carnahan is successful but the shock value evaporates quickly. Once he has done this once or twice the viewer understands that no one is assured to make it to the end credits alive but this strategy is effective only when we care enough about the characters for it to matter. We dont and it doesnt. On the surface Smokin Aces takes its cues from the work of Tarantino Guy Richie and Robert Rodriguez but Carnahans mastery of the techniques of violent comedy brutal action and slick dialogue is imperfect. He has an uneven resume - he made the low-budget exploitation thriller Blood Guts Bullets and Octane and the effective cop movie Narc. Smokin Aces is closer to the former than the latter and thats unfortunate. It hopes to cover its lack of sophistication with big guns out-of-control lunatics Mexican standoffs and Mission Impossible masks. (Although he stays away from the hyperstylization that characterized the earlier efforts.) Such things only go so far - not far enough to make a good movie as it turns out. Amidst all of this Ryan Reynolds provides an effective performance as the FBI agent whos always a step behind the bad guys and Jeremy Piven is suitably strung out as the drugged paranoid victim. A-list actors like Ray Liotta Ben Affleck and Andy Garcia dont have enough screen time to leave an impression. This isnt an actors movie however and its failure isnt the result of inadequate or ineffective performances. Smokin Aces doesnt work because the screenplay is too lean. Theres not enough material here to support a feature film. It takes too long for all hell to break loose and even when that happens its not the free-for-all we expect. The movie feels like a 30 minute short that is stretched beyond its natural length. In the end Smokin Aces has moments when it smolders but it never catches fire.

""Smokin Aces"" blows some cool smoke rings until it makes the very un-cool mistake of overstaying its welcome. Style and attitude pegged to a baroque plot concerning an FBI plan to snare a key mob witness that attracts a virtual convention of world-class killers burns up a lot of screen time but amounts to little more than some sensational scenes. However as exemplified by strong U.K. returns last week bucking nay-saying critics hungry young auds looking for fresh goods in January will flock to the mayhem ensuring aces first-week B.O. Much anticipated by fans of writer-director Joe Carnahans Sundance hits ""Narc"" and ""Blood Guts Bullets and Octane"" pic is far more under the sway of Quentin Tarantinos color-saturated bang-bang cinema than the helmers previous work. Tarantinos shadow can be a dangerous thing A better influence on Carnahan might have been author Elmore Leonard and his flair for weaving terrific story strands with vividly wrought characters. Title cards misleadingly suggest pic is a true-life tale of the FBIs efforts to bring down the Mafia by getting to Vegas entertainer Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) before the mob gets him first. In fact though grounded superficially in the reality of organized crimes ties to Nevada showbiz ""Smokin Aces"" is pure gun-toting fantasy daring auds to keep up with its high-speed narrative flow. Placing surveillance on Mafia boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin) fed agents Carruthers (Ray Liotta ""Narc"") and Messner (Ryan Reynolds) listen in on his plans to get rid of Buddy and remove his heart. Meaning of this detail isnt addressed until a completely impenetrable wrap-up. But Buddys importance -- hes at war with Sparazza for control of the Nevada mob -- is explained in a slickly assembled daisy chain of dialogues among the agents and their FBI topper Stanley Locke (Andy Garcia); bail bondsmen Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck) ""Pistol"" Pete Deeks (Peter Berg) and Hollis Elmore (Martin Henderson); and hired killers Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys) and lover Loretta Wyman (Davenia McFadden) who are aiming to bring Buddy down before the feds nab him. This presumes of course that a second-rate Frank Sinatra could actually vie for a high Mafia position but pic skips past this question and observes Buddy in his Lake Tahoe casino penthouse suite -- a diorama of coke-saturated post-coital sleaze and decrepitude that says more about Buddy than any smart-ass dialogue could hope to.While Buddy spins his wheels Carruthers and Messners team moves in -- as do Duprees crew Georgia and Loretta a crazed neo-Nazi trio called the Tremors a legendary torturer/killer named Acosta (Nestor Carbonell) and master of disguise Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan). Watching all these moving parts approach their target can be giddy fun especially since Carnahan knows where to place his camera and with editor Robert Frazen when to cut for maximum effect. For sheer visceral buzz from opening to mid-section pic delivers a lot of kick. But the often-stunning set pieces (including a dazzling shootout involving at least three different parties) lead to a dead end before Buddy is ultimately removed from the scene. His dispatch is for different reasons than Reynolds flummoxed Carruthers assumes and the longer Garcias Locke takes to explain the deeper nonsense the film drifts into as a bullet ballet turns into a jumble of whatsit devices that mean very little. Cinematographer Mauro Fiore pushes the widescreen image to extremes of color and texture using the Tahoe sun and the casinos indoor artificiality to overwhelming effect. Carnahans direction particularly well serves the effectively hyper Piven Liotta Affleck Carbonell and Keys who brims with sexy confidence. Tahoe provides a refreshing change of location from the now-common Vegas backdrop and the soundtrack gathers up a bric-a-brac of music sources including a relatively obscure Ennio Morricone cue from ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly.""

Just as Carnahans previous Narc paid homage to such 1970s cop thrillers as The French Connection with Smokin Aces hes chosen to salute the kitsch style-over-substance chase comedies of the 1980s making this a poor mans Midnight Run. The films whimsicality makes it a big step back for the director who shows he has little handle over anything bar garish action set-pieces replacing narrative structure and character development with Ben Affleck in a barrow-boy hat and Andy Garcia as an FBI chief with a bizarre accent. On the plus side Jason Bateman supplies an amusing cameo as a drunken cross-dressing lawyer and theres a soulful turn from Alicia Keys as a slinky assassin. Other than that its just a big old mess.
