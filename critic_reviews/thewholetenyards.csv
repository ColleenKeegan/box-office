Comments The Whole Ten Yards Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry reprise their respective roles as a mob killer and a dentist in this shrill strained sequel to The Whole Nine Yards. This time around a mobster (Kevin Pollak) abducts the dentists wife affording Perry a pretext for mugging nervously Willis for growling and shouting and Pollak for doing a silly Hungarian accent and slapping people. Every joke is stretched to the breaking point and no one seems to be having any fun. Directed by Howard Deutch a specialist in lame sequels to other peoples movies (The Odd Couple II Grumpier Old Men). PG-13 98 min.

"Whole Ten Yards The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; whole-ten-yards-the ) Whole Ten Yards The (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli I might have felt sad about what director Howard Deutch and screenwriter George Gallo have done to the characters from The Whole Nine Yards if I cared about them in the first place. The problem with a movie like Jonathan Lynns 2000 noir comedy is that it rarely inspires more than cursory interest (its final box office tally was under 60 million - solid numbers but far from blockbuster level). The word ""unnecessary"" seems understated in describing The Whole Ten Yards a movie whose existence probably excited only those who received a paycheck for participating. What can I say about a movie in which the chickens are more lively than the human cast? Where a sense of thinly-veiled desperation permeates every scene? (""Please laugh Pleeeeeaaaaseee"") Are we supposed to be amused by the image of Bruce Willis in fuzzy slippers and an apron? Are Matthew Perrys lame slapstick antics intended to send us into convulsions of laughter? And is the idea for us to figure out the gist of the plot even though huge chunks of footage have been edited out? Its bad enough that The Whole Ten Yards isnt funny but its not coherent either. Not that the storyline would pass muster for anything more high-browed than a TV sitcom. Ditto for the acting directing and pretty much everything else that appears on screen. The Whole Ten Yards assumes that the viewer has some familiarity with the first movie. All the significant players except Rosanna Arquette have returned (we can be thankful for small favors). Bruce Willis once again plays notorious killer Jimmy Tudeski whos now living in obscurity with his wife Jill (Amanda Peet). The two are having marital problems related to (a) Jimmys erectile dysfunction (b) Jills inability to fulfill her lifelong ambition of becoming a contract killer and (c) Jimmys apparent metamorphosis into Martha Stewart. Meanwhile in California Oz Oseransky (Perry) comes home from work one day to discover that goons have kidnapped his wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge). They are lorded over by Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak) the father of the mob boss Oz and Jimmy eliminated in the previous movie. Now in order to save Cynthia the dentist tracks down Jimmy and convinces his old pal to give up cooking and house cleaning and help him in a rescue attempt. During the course of the film I wondered a number of things why the filmmakers thought making this sequel was a good move why Matthew Perry is unlikely ever to have a movie career and why the rating had to be PG-13 (cheating us of another view of Peets breasts - the most noteworthy sight of the first movie). It always surprises me when films like this are greenlighted. People like to complain about the disconnect between the ""average"" moviegoer and the critic but what about the divide between movie producers and their customers. Howard Deutch is the man Hollywood calls upon when a lackluster sequel needs to be made. Hes the guy responsible for both The Odd Couple 2 and Grumpier Old Men. Deutch started in the business as the handpicked director of John Hughes (he helmed Pretty in Pink Some Kind of Wonderful and The Great Outdoors) and The Whole Ten Yards includes a reference to Hughes Planes Trains and Automobiles - although it was a lot funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it. But if you dont laugh at that there are other opportunities like Kevin Pollacks accent (which was grating five minutes into the first film) or the propensity of a 107-year old woman to pass gas. Surely by now you must be rolling in the aisles? No? I could mention that the Bruce Willis character is often genuinely unpleasant or that some of the films violence (such as a woman being slapped in the face) seems too mean-spirited to be wed effectively with laugh-generating material. But inconsistencies in tone are minor when compared to the confusion created by the editors butchery. Given the quality of whats in the final print I have no doubt that the missing material deserved to be cut (in fact I can think of 99 additional minutes that could have been snipped with little loss) but were often left without connecting scenes. Those few viewers who care about the progression of events will be disorientated. Everyone else will gradually realize that the con game perpetrated by The Whole Ten Yards is to steal a whole ten dollars.

The happy couples we saw at the end of the first film arent so happy at the start of this one. Former mob hit man Jimmy the Tulip (Bruce Willis) living in Mexico with his wife Jill (Amanda Peet) seems to have lost it. His straggly blond hair is kept in place with an Aunt Jemima kerchief and hes more worried about rubbing out stains than rubbing out people. Plus hes having trouble in the sack. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""The Whole Ten Yards"" with Bruce Willis Matthew Perry Amanda Peet Kevin Pollack. Directed by Howard Deutch from a screenplay by George Gallo (based on a story by Mitchell Kapner). 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content some violence and language. Several theaters. Over in Brentwood Calif. Oz (Matthew Perry) the nervous dentist has responded to his adventures in the first film by becoming an absolute paranoiac. His home is set up with high-tech security; he greets a cookie-selling Buttercup (Girl Scout) with a loaded gun; and when his wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) tells him shes pregnant he responds with dreams of building a moat around their house. ""Fear?"" he says when she objects. ""Whos talking about fear? Im talking about a moat."" Perry punctuates the line with all the subtlety of a sitcom actor. Ah but then Cynthia calls Jimmy in Mexico and the two we realize are hatching a plan. Is it a plan to make Oz less paranoid? No heres their plan Cynthia will get kidnapped by the Hungarian mobster Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollack) the father of Janni Gogolak (also Kevin Pollack) who was offed in the first film. Oz in a panic will then ask Jimmy for his help and Jimmy will refuse then reluctantly accept meanwhile threatening to kill Oz the entire time. Generally when a character in a film is involved in their own secret subplot -- see ""The Usual Suspects"" -- the secret isnt revealed until the end and often with flashbacks to the pertinent scenes so the audience can go ""Ohhhhh."" By revealing the secret subplot early ""Ten Yards"" accomplishes two things. It removes any dramatic tension regarding the protagonists peril because after all this is their plan. Theyre controlling events rather than being controlled by them. It also means we dont have to watch the movie again for plotholes. Theyre right in front of us. Getting shot at a thousand times -- was that part of the plan? Cynthia being threatened -- what about that? How about the craziness with the kerchief? And why go to these elaborate methods to reach their final goal? Whatever happened to simple breaking and entering? Oh and the movies not funny either. Perry does for doors what Gallagher did for watermelons. Thats not a compliment.

PHOTOGRAPHS TO BE USED SOLELY FOR ADVERTISING PROMOTION PUBLICITY OR ... more Lackluster plotline and overreaching stars make Ten Yards seem more like a marathon 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Whole Ten Yards Comedy. Starring Bruce Willis Matthew Perry Amanda Peet. Directed by Howard Deutch. Written by George Gallo and Mitchell Kapner. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Whole Ten Yards"" lasts a whole lot longer than ""The Whole Nine Yards"" the 2000 comedy that spawned it. The sequel seems interminably long in fact. Heres a typical scene Bruce Willis or Matthew Perry makes a crack that doesnt work then tries to sell it by smirking (Willis) or running into a wall (Perry). The scene lasts another few minutes with nothing going on until somebody smacks somebody across the face. Slap-happy and slapdash ""Ten Yards"" lacks the clever twists and turns that made the original such fun. The sequel has exactly one twist and its not very clever. Instead of constructing a real plot the writers rely on the considerable charms of the movies stars. At least thats one way of looking at it. The other is they hang them out to dry. Willis and Perry dance as fast as they can. A deft physical comedian Perry can take a punch with unusual elan but he keeps doing this jerky convulsive move with his body to try to rustle up laughs. Willis seems to be making stuff up. When his hit man Jimmy suspects Perrys character of tipping off his whereabouts he calls him ""the Squealster"" ... ""Remington Squeal."" You fear Willis will break into that ""bananafanna"" song at any moment. The movie starts with Jimmy in the witness protection program in Mexico with his wife (Amanda Peet) the dental assistant and homicide aficionada from the first film. The sequels thin thread of a story reunites Jimmy with Oz the dentist played by Perry by having Ozs wife (Natasha Henstridge) kidnapped. As Laszlo the English-mangling crime lord behind the kidnapping Kevin Pollak revives his shtick from the first movie where he played Laszlos son. His jokes consist of mispronounced swear words ""Im going to kill the batch. "" Laszlo constantly hits kicks or otherwise attempts to maim his other dullard son. Some scenes dont make sense. Henstridges character flirts with the dumb son in what seems like an attempt to win his favor. Then she insults him telling him his father thinks hes an idiot. This moment remains a puzzler even when the movies twist is revealed. But theres definite consistency to the scenes conclusion. The son smacks the woman in the jaw. The characters bad behavior had a certain freshness in the first film. Their amorality complemented the black humor and farcical setups. Here its just ugly. ""Talk to me that way again and I will stick a knife in your face"" Jimmy tells his wife. Funny stuff. The pairing of Willis and the vivid very game Peet seems full of promise. ""Lets say you and I just go out and kill somebody"" Jimmy purrs to his wife as if inviting her to a steak dinner and moonlight walk. But they bicker and insult each other for the rest of the film. He complains about her lousy aim with a gun and she teases him about his lack of sexual prowess. Erectile- dysfunction jokes which guarantee a cheap uneasy half-laugh from the audience are now the lowest form of movie comedy. They replace flatulence jokes which by the way this movie also features. Instead of seeing Peet shedding her clothes the way she did in ""Nine Yards"" we are treated to Willis naked butt. Jimmy and Oz wake up next to each other and the movie mines another comedy standby homosexual panic. Only Willis isnt panicked at all as Jimmy smoothly informs his friend that sometimes men have to be there for each other. Its hard not to love Willis at that moment. Thats one of the few scenes where the timing isnt absolutely off. Some jokes might even have been funny had they not been muffled or delivered a beat too late. Director Howard Deutch (""Grumpier Old Men"") either wasnt present when the movie was shot or he gave his stars too much leeway. But he shouldnt have to shoulder the blame. It took the whole cast and crew to ensure there would be no ""Whole Eleven Yards."" -- Advisory This film contains raw language violence nudity.

The Whole Ten Yards Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-whole-ten-yards-2004,200,thewholetenyards6,thewholetenyards,rogerebert
"This haphazard Whole proves weaker than the sum of its parts - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW This haphazard Whole proves weaker than the sum of its parts By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 9 2004 As it turns out ""The Whole Ten Yards"" is not as desperate unfunny and nonsensical as its title. Its worse. Worse than you can imagine. Unless of course youve imagined 90-something minutes of bloopers and outtakes that congeal into a story -- much the way a scab is formed.Bruce Willis Matthew Perry Amanda Peet Natasha Henstridge and Kevin Pollak reclaim their roles from ""The Whole Nine Yards"" a movie that back in 2000 charmed you into liking it. The screenplay about a hitman a dentist their wives a crusty mobster and a dental hygienist who wants to be a hitman was silly and the directing was sort of breezy. The actors appeared to be having fun and their enthusiasm was catchy.""The Whole Ten Yards"" reunites Perrys Nicolas ""Oz"" Oseransky DDS and Williss retired contract killer Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski for a plot whose details are illogical even once theyre explained to you. Jimmy has moved to Baja and turned domestic. He pushes a vacuum cleaner and roasts meat while wearing clamdiggers bunny slippers and a headscarf that cant cover all his ratty blond hair. He looks like the hausfrau of Margaritaville.While he cleans his upbeat wife Jill (Peet) takes up the assassination duties and discusses having a baby with Jimmy. Their bliss is interrupted when the ancient Hungarian gangster Lazlo Gogolak (Pollak) fresh from the pokey kidnaps Cynthia (Henstridge) Jimmys ex-wife whos now the spouse of Oz. Naturally she must be saved. Yet screenwriter George Gallo makes the loony decision to have Jimmy be blase about getting Cynthia back which makes the whole mess seem even less urgent.The workhorse director Howard Deutch has made a few dogs (""Grumpier Old Men"" ""The Replacements"") but this is his first turkey. It seems to be happening in slow motion or underwater. Things are so haphazard the movie feels almost avant-garde. The blown-up cars and gunshots are weirdly welcome though theyre the only evidence of conviction. Otherwise the picture is clogged with painful non sequiturs (Are Jimmy and Oz really waking up in bed together?) and dopey side plots.Peet who was so good in the first movie looks like shes about to crack up in some scenes and is embarrassingly weepy in others. Pollak under a ton of geezer makeup works even harder. He spits out lines the way Regis Philbins cousin from Budapest might. Henstridge just sits in a chair and in one scene plays cards with the woman who plays Gogolaks gassy 103-year-old mother.Perrys disbelief impatience and exasperation expose what a sorry excuse for a movie this is. The screenplay has Oz question every development like a brat in the back seat. His entire fidgety stammering performance is one long ""are we there yet?""And Willis is kept on a sporadic diet of terrible jokes about Jimmys ""erectile dysfunction."" He squints and strains through the role as though hed taken a laxative to produce comedy. (It doesnt work.) He and Perry have no chemistry; they dont work together for laughs; they get out of each others way. Their lack of teamwork makes you long for Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in ""Midnight Run"" a far superior movie about a hitman and an uptight white-collar guy.

Related video See a clip of the movie Old habits die hard for Willis mobster-gone-straight character Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski. Warner Bros. Pictures One year its Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in AnalyzeThis; three years later its Analyze That. One year its Bruce Willis in The Whole Nine Yards; four years later its The Whole Ten Yards. Or if you shell out for the latest at evening prices the whole 10 bucks. Like its 2000 predecessor Ten is full of people who can play comedy Willis Matthew Perry and Amanda Peet. Natasha Henstridge who returns as well looks mighty fine just sitting in a nifty sweater-slacks combo though that pretty well defines her role. But the material they have to clomp through is like a cheese dish that has been sitting out the whole 10 days. Heres another major-studio comedy that makes you want to apply for frequent-misery mileage. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Whole Ten Yards   (out of four) Stars Bruce Willis Matthew Perry Amanda Peet Natasha Henstridge Kevin Pollack Director Howard Deutch Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for sexual content some violence and language. Opens Friday nationwide Ten natch picks upfrom Nine a modest but also modestly profitable hit-man hit that did even better on DVD. The romantic deck of Nines two couples remains re-shuffled Dentist Perry is wed to Willis ex Henstridge while the once-professional assassin Willis is coupled with former dental assistant Peet who still longs to be a hit woman. But Willis now domesticated spends his days vacuuming and preparing exotic meals. ""I thought I married a contract killer"" Peet laments ""not Martha Stewart."" We wont go there. The plot hinges on the vengeful abduction of Henstridge by a Mob kingpin (Kevin Pollak) whose son (also Pollak) was killed in the original. Pollak senior sporting lots of facial latex bellows in ways that make the late Rod Steigers broader performances look austere. The movies last hour or so turns on Pollaks standoff against the rest of the principals -- and on Perrys fears that he and Willis may have gotten to know each other a little too well while sharing a bed after a night of boozing. Destined to be on DVD by the time 2004 reaches the 50-yard line Ten is more stale than it is ungodly. But watching poor Perrys heavily plural pratfalls here you have to figure that even Friends work-starved actor Joey (Matt LeBlanc) would be discriminating enough to let this script go.

The strain needed to extend ""The Whole Ten Yards"" a yard -- and to feature length -- is so evident it breaks new pics comedy spirit making it a dubious member of the Sequel Hall of Shame. This review was updated on Apr. 6 2004. ""The Whole Nine Yards"" scarcely needed a reprise the 2000 pic pretty much wrapped up every loose end and sent its heroes and anti-heroes into happily-ever-after-land. The strain needed to extend ""The Whole Ten Yards"" a yard -- and to feature length -- is so painfully evident it breaks new pics comedy spirit making it a particularly dubious member of the Sequel Hall of Shame. Mildly good takes of 57 million domestically and 61 mil overseas by the first edition could be matched this time but only if Warners marketing aim is aces and if grieving ""Friends"" fans show up opening weekend to wish co-star Matthew Perry well. Although ""Nine Yards"" was only occasionally funny it enjoyed a certain breezy unfettered quality carried mainly by Perry as bumbling dentist Oz flirtatious wannabe assassin Amanda Peet and the presence of co-star Bruce Willis as likable hit man Jimmy. Re-assembling the core cast (with one initially clever twist) is one of the few smart moves in ""Ten Yards"" while replacing helmer Jonathan Lynn with Howard Deutch (""The Odd Couple II"") proves a fatal mistake. After a brief flashback that has only the faintest of payoffs at the finale pic shows Jimmy and Jill (Peet) currently holed up in a Mexican Riviera town. They squabble as he tiresomely tries to keep up his cover as a ""housewife"" wearing an apron working around the kitchen while she is back from yet another botched assassination assignment. In Los Angeles Oz is more paranoid than ever and tripping over his own feet. His wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) comes off as the picture of patience for putting up with Ozs unbelievably irritating obsessions. To complete the picture of the two couples screenwriter George Gallo makes Cynthia pregnant with Ozs child. Gallo then posits that elderly and long-incarcerated crime boss Laszlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak) is being released from prison near L.A. brimming with vengeance against Jimmy and Oz for killing his son (played by Pollak in first pic). Why the ultra-cautious Oz would want to be anywhere near Laszlos prison is incomprehensible. Worse Jimmys lame stunt of acting like he is doing housekeeping duties at their home as a cover (a mirthlessly unfunny opening number in Willis feeblest comedy performance) would appear useless given that Jill is out trying to rub out folks -presumably making them both big fat targets. Since it does truck in the old goofy movie tradition of gunplay mixed with nonsense pic might have been more successful if the comic shtick were better judged. But Pollaks Laszlo slathered in absurd left-of-Liberace makeup and hair design is a messy goulash of improv and manic over-the-top indulgence unlike anything this talented comic has done before. Rather than adding anything fresh Pollaks business simply competes with Willis and Perrys characters. Lazslos hapless surviving son Strabo (Frank Collison) is just the goofball the doctor ordered for this kind of movie but the filmmakers fail to exploit his characters potential. Momentum and any possible second wind for pic is soon gone in a strenuously overlong and miscalculated sequence of events at a Los Angeles motel. Wrap-up and turning-of-tables on Laszlo is given the wink-and-nod approach suggesting that everyone involved believes the antics are much more clever than they actually are. The strain of trying too hard weakens the perfs of Willis Pollak and sadly even Peet who was a bright spot in the original. Perry and Henstridge are more successful at carrying on the same tone as before but Perrys door-bumping and foot-tripping act takes Dennis Weavers buffoonish stumbling in ""Touch of Evil"" one degree further. Collison owner of one of moviedoms funniest mugs provides more pleasure here than anybody else. Canuck locations of first entry are replaced this time by Mexican spots which are presented in an unpleasantly Hollywoodized take. Pics look is slick and easy on the eye with Seth Flaums editing a sharp plus and John Debneys jokey score a distinct negative.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr C The Whole Ten Yards Genre Mystery and Thriller Action/Adventure Comedy; Starring Matthew Perry Bruce Willis Natasha Henstridge Amanda Peet Kevin Pollak; Director Howard Deutch; Author Mitchell Kapner; Release Date Wide 04/09/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 97; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 7 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT The Whole Ten Yards is the zany hitman action-comedy sequel that nobody asked for - and yes in case youre wondering its every bit as nonsensical and overitalicized a mess as ""The Whole Nine Yards."" Theres one difference In the first film the members of the patchwork cast looked as if they had no reason to be doing anything that they were doing. Now theyve got a motive (of sorts) Theyre starring in the follow-up to a hit movie This has infused everyone with a bizarre confidence that works to the films advantage. Its still a frantic cheesy slop heap that exemplifies everything thats gone wrong in Hollywood over the last 20 years (to say that the script was written by George Gallo is an insult to the word written) but Bruce Willis Matthew Perry Amanda Peet and Kevin Pollak attack each and every absurd scene with a we-know-this-is-crap-but-were-having-fun-anyway gusto that recalls how the cast of ""The Carol Burnett Show"" used to pump life into a really bad sketch by acting as if it was the most uproarious thing in the world. Perry is actually much better than he was the first time around. As Oz the mild klutzy dentist who ends up for no good reason in the middle of kidnappings and shoot-outs he gives a physically energized nerd performance out of the arm-waving Jerry Lewis school. I wont put you to sleep by recounting the convolutions that pass for a plot but suffice it to say that Ozs wife played by a morose Natasha Henstridge (the one performer who doesnt appear to be enjoying herself) has been kidnapped by Pollaks Lazlo Gogolak a recently paroled crime boss whos the father of the character Pollak played in the original film. Wearing an ascot Larry Tates hair and Lew Wassermans glasses Pollak speaks in a Funny Accent that sounds like a cross between Yiddish and Italian. He doesnt win big laughs exactly but he amuses himself mightily and thats the spirit of the movie. As the addled hitman Jimmy Willis may be coasting all the way to the bank but what he brings to ""The Whole Ten Yards"" is a bona fide star projection of annoyance and rage. Willis in disguise as a homemaker in fuzzy slippers fawning over his latest recipe is not funny but Willis yelling at Perry as if he had nothing but genuine contempt for the mans existence is...a wee bit funny. In 2004 thats entertainment. Or not. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.
