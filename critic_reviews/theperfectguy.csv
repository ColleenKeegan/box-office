This premise touches on fears of overreaching Internet surveillance a common anxiety in light of Edward Snowdens revelations. Yet the script written by Tyger Williams from a story created by Williams and Alan McElroy doesnt really explore the zeitgeist--it simply exploits it for a reasonably engaging thriller with some topical overtones. That the movie is a hit probably owes more to the star power of Sanaa Lathan Michael Ealy and Morris Chestnut than to any thematic resonance. These actors fill out their underwritten parts nicely and director David M. Rosenthal focuses on their performances rather than build any subtext through his imagery. The themes float emptily around the film--viewers are welcome to elaborate on them in their imaginations but the filmmakers dont provide much help as to how audiences should interpret them. In keeping with the movies vagueness Lathans character works as a lobbyist for an unspecified organization. What matters is that shes successful in her work--the actual nature of her work is left unexplained--and that she desires a secure romantic relationship that will lead to marriage and children. Soon after the film starts she breaks up with her boyfriend of two years (Chestnut) because hes unwilling to settle down. She encounters Ealys character at a bar a few months later. He helps her get rid of an obnoxious man whos trying to pick her up and they end up spending the evening together. This leads to courtship with Ealy doing everything Lathan assumes she wants from a suitor. Hes great in bed cordial with her friends and parents and deferential to her wherever they go. What Lathan doesnt realize is that Ealy is also a possessive psychopath and that he wont let her get out of the relationship when she decides shes had enough. What follows is another Fatal Attraction knockoff with Ealy invading Lathans life after she tries to get away from him. Sometimes he breaks into her house--in a clever detail Lathan lives in a midcentury-modernist ranch home with lots of windows that allow strangers to look in and few places inside where inhabitants can hide. Most of the time though he terrorizes her through the Internet hacking into her e-mail and the Facebook page of her former boyfriend whom she starts to see again after breaking up with Ealy. Lathan comes to feel as though she has no privacy and she finds that the police are unable to help her take care of the problem. To me this feels like an exaggerated version of what people encounter every day in the Internet age. Websites lure users into giving up personal information only to pass it along to advertisers or government agencies. And then theres the spectral presence of hackers who can ""steal"" our identities through their use of computers. What makes these threats so frightening is that theyre impersonal--the perpetrators cant be seen but the effects of their work can be felt. The Perfect Guy makes this threat intimate and it makes its motives clear. In one of their more provocative gestures the filmmakers suggest that Lathans desire for security actually brings this threat into existence (at first she wants someone who will care about her every move)--but they let the heroine off the hook by making Ealy such a monster. They also show that the solution to Lathans problem lies in personal vengeance rather than the intervention of law enforcement an implausible albeit dramatically satisfying conclusion that suggests individuals still have agency in responding to the matter of surveillance.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet If nothing else The Perfect Guy boasts a clever casting hook. Michael Ealy has such a calm confident demeanor and such piercing blue eyes that he makes sense as a potential romantic savior--and becomes appropriately chilling as a deranged stalker. Its not that Carter (Ealy) the stalker in question does anything especially memorable when his obsession with Leah (Sanaa Lathan) boils over but hes an inspired fit as a guy who seems too good to be true and then is.The whole movie though consists of ""seems"" followed quickly by ""is."" Leah seems unhappy that her longtime boyfriend Dave (Morris Chestnut) doesnt feel ready for marriage or children yet; almost immediately they break up. Carter swoops into her life and looks like a promising romantic partner; he treats her right and dazzles her parents in a sequence that includes a welcome and far-too-brief appearance from Charles S. Dutton. Then Carter displays a sudden flash of violence that seems like trouble and almost immediately goes into stalker mode when Leah pulls away. Naturally his prowess as an IT security professional comes into play as he continues to menace his ex.The Perfect Guy could be described as concise if all of these moments didnt also feel so perfunctory. Scene after scene exists only to deliver facts for later Carters family background; the location of Leahs spare housekey; the presence of a mildly nosy neighbor and a clumsily introduced pet cat. Plenty of well-plotted thrillers depend on a similar accumulation of details but this one is almost all accumulation and almost zero actual thrills. And even for an uncomplicated thriller the supporting characters lack inner depth; they behave like mannequins who come to life only when Leah and Carter enter the frame. This is especially clear in an early scene where Carter gets rid of a jerk hitting on Leah at a bar; the interaction feels utterly fake because the movie has the actor playing the jerk stand awkwardly motionless between his lines transparently waiting for his cues.The dissonance of watching Carter get creepier and creepier then is about all the movie has to offer in terms of the requisite oh-shit realizations its supposed to provide. But apart from one creepy scene where Carter slips into a fog of shower steam undetected director David M. Rosenthal doesnt build suspense; at one point the rapid succession of Carters stalking scenes practically becomes a wacky montage. Its surprising because Rosenthal made the patient rural noir A Single Shot--not a great film but one that at least conveyed a clear sense of place. The Perfect Guy offers only a return trip to underlit glass-housed Los Angeles.With such boring text the movie inspires focus on its subtext which isnt especially rich but does pass the time as Carter creeps toward his final confrontation with Leah. At first it seems like the movie is punishing Leah for making any demands of her relationship with Dave--and it is a little but Lathan and Chestnut make each of their sides seem reasonable. As the story intensifies though its intimations get weirder. In just a few scenes the movie manages to casually stigmatize bipolar disorder foster children and high IQs and finally endorses gun ownership as not just a sound method of self-defense but possibly the only method of self-defense. Its especially disappointing to see this reductive view applied to the likably tough Lathan who has previously teamed up with a Predator. Even The Perfect Guys regressions though are sadly familiar; this is Sony genre subsidiary Screen Gems second annual low-rent thriller starring talented black actors in the types of leading roles they should be getting in bigger or at least better movies. Theres certainly an audience for these thrillers but imagine how big that audience might be for one that really works. In the meantime to save some time and money next autumn just picture Taye Diggs trying to murder Regina Hall and wonder why they cant do better.

TWITTER Sanaa Lathan and Michael Ealy star in this thriller about a woman tormented by a spurned lover turned stalker. Youve seen it a thousand times before. A guy falls for the wrong girl. A girl falls for the wrong guy. Before long theres some serious stalking going on and bunnies are being boiled. Substitute a cat for the bunny (no spoilers here about its fate) and you have the ironically titled generic thriller The Perfect Guy that somehow wound up on the big screen instead of on Lifetime. The story begins with successful business executive Leah (Sanaa Lathan) and her boyfriend of two years Dave (Morris Chestnut) enjoying a blissful relationship. That is until the commitment-phobic David plays nicely with a hosts child at a party and it reminds Leah of her desire to start a family. She issues an ultimatum that is promptly declined. Shortly thereafter she has a casual encounter with a handsome stranger at a coffee shop who performs the ultimate act of gallantry by giving up his iced latte. A couple of weeks later he shows up again this time warding off a boorish drunk hitting on Leah at a bar. He introduces himself as Carter (Michael Ealy) who works in ""corporate espionage"" and when he kisses her at the end of their subsequent first date it causes her to go weak at the knees and exclaim to herself ""Holy mother of God"" Read More Jeepers Creepers 3 Gets the Greenlight Carter soon lives up to the titular description introducing the previously buttoned-up Leah to the joys of sex in a nightclub bathroom and yet he also proves the perfect gentleman during a weekend stay at her parents house when he sends her away after shes snuck into his assigned separate bedroom. He manages to quickly win over her surly unfriendly father (Charles S. Dutton) by magically producing a pair of primo baseball game tickets. But after he suddenly erupts into rage and nearly beats a man to death at a gas station for the offense of talking to her Leah sees him in a new light and begins to back away from the relationship. When she breaks it off entirely Carter is revealed as a raving psycho who will stop at nothing to get her back. You can pretty much guess the rest of the story from here as the increasingly desperate Leah seeks help from friends and eventually the police as Carter hacks her phone and computer her beloved cat disappears and various other forms of mayhem ensue. A restraining order is issued to little effect and even physical threats from Dave newly back in Leahs life dont dissuade her stalker who uses his professional skills in pursuit of his malicious goals. Read More Drones Docs and Dan Rather Scandal and Politics Invade TIFF Lineup Tyger Williams screenplay is strictly formulaic with only the occasional bizarre moment--such as when Carter after having broken into Leahs house uses her toothbrush in fetish-like fashion -- hinting at the stylishly baroque thriller the film might have been. David M. Rosenthals direction is similarly uninspired and you can practically feel the fatigue of the lead performers straining to elevate the hackneyed material. The uncommonly good supporting cast--including John Getz (Blood Simple) Tess Harper (Tender Mercies) and Gordon Clapp (NYPD Blue)--only serves as a distressing reminder of the better roles theyve had in the past. The one standout is Holt McCallany who provides complex dimensions to his stock character of a sympathetic detective who finally gives a desperate Leah the advice she needs to turn the tables on her tormentor. But like everything else in this B-movie it comes too little and too late. Production Rocklin/Faust Cast Saana Lathan Michael Ealy Morris Chestnut L. Scott Caldwell Cahrles S.

"Sanaa You in Danger Girl The Perfunctory Stupidity of The Perfect Guy << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Sanaa You in Danger Girl The Perfunctory Stupidity of The Perfect Guy Dan McFadden/Sony Movies September 15 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print I love Sanaa Lathan except when she has to play dumb. And boy does The Perfect Guy need her to be dumb. Its designed to exploit the insecurities of so-called careerists. Youve spent so many years using your intelligence and strength to amass clout income property and hair you cant get wet that suddenly youre 36 and so desperate for a man to start a family with that youre on edge -- like on peak Angela Bassett edge. Thats where Lathans Los Angeles political consultant Leah Vaughn is at the start of the movie ready to have the rest of having it all. But her high-powered boyfriend Dave (Morris Chestnut) is like Dont start with that. But how can she not? She just watched him be really sweet at a party to somebodys son. He reminds her that divorce runs in his family like diabetes or gas. ""I dont want to wake up hating you"" he says and so they stop sleeping together. Two months later Leahs at a bar being stood up by a friend and hit on by a lout when an IT expert named Carter (Michael Ealy) swoops in and pretends to be her boyfriend. This happens to be the same person she first saw at a coffee shop back when she was with Dave and he made her so nervous with lust that she almost forgot her latte. Now shes forgetting her common sense. After a date she takes him back to her place and roots around for the spare key to her big glass house on a hill. And theres a close-up of the key -- as if the audience needs it. We know hes crazy. This is the sort of movie that leaves you yelling at the screen regardless of your movie-theater politics. Carter is cute and all but why isnt Leah bothered that when he speaks he sounds like one of the killers from Scream? I mean Ealys entire terrible performance is an act of foreshadowing. He might as well be wearing a ""Blank From Hell"" T-shirt. On the drive back from a Bay Area weekend of not sharing the same bed at Leahs parents house Carter beats a stranger silly at a gas station while Leah screams her head off. To be fair to Carter he sees what we see which is a stranger leaning into Carters antique car and talking to his girlfriend. The stranger is just asking about the vehicle but Carter acts like its the climax of Taken. That incident is enough for her to end the relationship. But he wont let her. He stalks her at work and at home. He uses his IT wizardry to hack into her email account and that spare key to install surveillance cameras in her house. While hes there he takes a moment to nuzzle one of her bed pillows finish a glass of leftover wine and suck on her toothbrush. He leaves an ""If I cant have you no one will"" note on her car (yes this is a movie with an empty-parking-lot sequence -- in 2015). Oh and he steals her cat which in a better sex thriller would feel like a metaphor for something. But The Perfect Guy is too busy stealing from every other Blank From Hell movie -- Sleeping With the Enemy and Sliver and No Good Deed -- except in the dullest cheapest-looking way. Leahs best friends (Kathryn Morris and Rutina Wesley) are two talking haircuts. Her doomed next-door neighbor is Tess Harper. At least I assume its Tess Harper since the lighting in this movie -- which David M. Rosenthal directed and Tyger Williams typed up (his last screenplay was 1993s Menace II Society) -- is so bad that its hard to see anything that doesnt happen in broad daylight. Thats a lot of stuff including a car crash and a couple of murders. Eventually Dave reenters the picture and Leah promises to chill out. He might not be ready for a family but at least he doesnt require a restraining order. I wish Rosenthal knew how to direct actors because hes got some good ones here. But nothing comes off any of the stars. Theyre just shy of being zombies. Ealy manages to be so many places so undetectably -- in the closet under the bed in a tailgating car -- that I wouldnt have been surprised to learn hes been dead the whole time. Its never been more tempting to put out an APB for Tyler Perry who learned how to make a zesty suspenseful work of trash Ive never missed Temptation Confessions of a Marriage Counselor more than I did while watching this. The climaxes of these films tend to be like the end of a divas pop song where all the fierceness is. Before that we have to watch Lathan make mistake after mistake and say things to the detective working her case like ""I dont know what you mean."" Until the climax that sums up her performance. Leah aims most of her cluelessness and sense of affront at a white detective named Hansen whos played by Holt McCallany one of those actors whose seen-it-all ruggedness constitutes a kind of street wisdom. Hes the best thing in the movie and the only actor who has any palpable chemistry with Lathan. Nothing happens between them because that would have been too much. But it should have. That would have been something. This was the no. 1 movie in the country last weekend. No Good Deed which came out almost the same weekend a year ago managed that feat too. And Straight Outta Compton led the box office for three straight weekends last month. Setting aside that theyre all movies about (or courtesy of) black men who threaten black women theyre hits that further contradict the myth at the studios that Americans dont want to see movies with mostly black casts -- Ride Along and Think Like a Man Too also hit no. 1. The Perfect Guy cost a relatively cheap 12 million even though its impossible to see where the money went to keep Ealy in latex gloves? But budgets that low mean these movies dont have to conquer the Chinese box office. Hollywood shouldnt stop getting behind important movies like 12 Years a Slave and Selma. But a little Empire which resumes on Fox in a couple of weeks also never hurts. Glorious difficult depictions of iconic black lives with talented black actors is necessary. But true entertainment equality is being able to see them star in the same lucrative crap as white people.

"Perfect Guy More cliches than thrills in Fatal Attraction-wannabe - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Perfect Guy More cliches than thrills in Fatal Attraction-wannabe The Perfect Guy Leah (Sanaa Lathan) falls for Carter (Michael Ealy) with predictable repercussions in ""The Perfect Guy."" Leah (Sanaa Lathan) falls for Carter (Michael Ealy) with predictable repercussions in ""The Perfect Guy."" Michael Rechtshaffen Perfection like beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. Its a concept that Leah realizes a little too late in ""The Perfect Guy"" a glossy cliche-laden revenge thriller about the perils of meeting Mr. Too Good To Be True.A successful lobbyist with a taste for Ketel One martinis and a sleek glass house nestled in the Hollywood Hills Leah (Sanaa Lathan) would appear to have it all save for a stalled relationship with a nice-guy architect Dave (Morris Chestnut). Feeling ""dated out"" at age 36 Leahs ready to take things to the next level with a husband and children but Daves not ready to commit so she cuts him loose. Two months later she encounters the dangerously handsome Carter (ridiculously charismatic Michael Ealy) in a cafe and sparks immediately fly over their iced lattes.SIGN UP for the free Classic Hollywood newsletter gt;gt; Had Leah seen ""Fatal Attraction"" or even the more recent Jennifer Lopez clunker ""The Boy Next Door"" she would have picked up on the telltale signs that Carter a corporate security IT specialist was not the dreamboat he appeared to be even with that killer smile. See the most-read stories this hour gt;gt;Read the story But rather than realize the charmer who drives a vintage black Charger is the sort of soft-spoken loner whom pets tend to growl at Leah impulsively inducts him into the Boyfriend Hall of Fame with unsurprising repercussions of the restraining order ilk.Shes not the only one to rush things. Rather than allow suspicions of Carters true nature to build gradually to an ever-narrowing shadow of a doubt director David M. Rosenthal in his first studio assignment dispenses with the element of tension and rushes headlong into the psychotic behavior.Ealy known for his more affable easygoing turns in the ""Think Like a Man"" films and last years ""About Last Night"" remake clearly relishes the opportunity to play a cool calculating sociopath. But it would have been more rewarding had the predictable script by Tyger Williams (1993s ""Menace II Society"") given him some grayer shadings to play in his rather abrupt shift from sweet-talker to stalker.Likewise for Lathan an actress whose ability to portray confidence and vulnerability simultaneously has clicked with audiences in ""Love amp; Basketball"" and the hit ""Best Man"" movies.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;Here viewers are never really given the chance to watch her exhibit any sort of crucial conflict as she makes the transition from refined professional to a take-charge woman in jeopardy.The movie does look glossily appealing with director Rosenthal and his cinematographer Peter Simonite capturing Los Angeles to classic sun-kissed noir-tinged perfection.And when it comes to notions of perfection theres no underestimating the crowd-pleasing effect of a couple of hours spent kicking back in AC in the middle of a nasty heat wave. Despite its serious imperfections the soapy escapism provided by ""The Perfect Guy"" at least arrives at an opportune time.----------""The Perfect Guy""MPAA rating PG-13 for violence menace sexuality brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying In general releaseALSOPlane crash on Tom Cruise movie set kills two crew membersToronto 2015 Rachel Weisz calls absurdist love story The Lobster romantic with a capital RWatts made its mark on Frank Gehry now the architect is returning the favor Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Jennifer Lopez Rachel Weisz Frank Gehry Tom Cruise Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-perfect-guy-movie-review-20150912-story.html,200,theperfectguy4,theperfectguy,latimes

For every nasty masterpiece like Basic Instinct there are dozens of bottom-feeders like Jade. These sexy stabby flicks clogged cineplexes in the early 90s but once the bloom was off the Joe Eszterhas rose those types of films were relegated to Lifetime and robbed of their fundamental grit. But like most everything from the 90s the style is back around although its clearly still trying to shake off the basic cable neutering. The Perfect Guy a noble attempt at re-capturing the dark arousal of Fatal Attraction. It presents high-powered lobbyist Leah (Sanaa Lathan) who breaks up with commitment-averse boyfriend Dave (Morris Chestnut) and finds herself seduced by the impossibly chivalrous Carter (Michael Ealy). Carter is a dream who gets along with her friends takes her to a cool underground reggae club and buys her dad tickets to see his favorite baseball team. But things take a turn pretty quick and after she witnesses Carter brutally assault a guy at a gas station she breaks it off. Weve all seen enough of these movies to know where this is going. Carter gets obsessive and begins to use his knowledge of computers (hes a network security expert) to stalk Leah his actions escalated by her reconciliation with Dave and her regular trips to report his actions to a detective (Holt McCallany). The first half hour is sluggish but once Carter unravels the true home-invading craziness can begin. The Perfect Guy escalates quite nicely leading to a satisfyingly white-knuckled finale. Lathan wavers deftly between strength and victimhood and Ealy plays a perfectly smooth creep. But for all its third act nuttiness The Perfect Guy really should have gone way crazier. For a movie that opens with its star in the shower and features a sex tape as a major plot point its remarkably modest with nary a stray body part or countercultural kink to titillate. When an erotic thriller leaves out the ""erotic"" part all thats left is a perfectly adequate domestic disturbance tale that should have given in to its more base desires.

(Dan McFadden) BY Eddie Goldberger NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday September 11 2015 348 PM Title THE PERFECT GUY Film Info You can take a perfect nap. With Sanaa Lathan Michael Ealy. Director David M. Rosenthal (140) PG-13; Violence Area theaters THERE HAVE been enough stalker-boyfriend movies over the years that any new one must change the formula. But ""The Perfect Guy"" has no such ambition. Its a lazy by-the-numbers bore. It almost jumps through hoops to not be different in any way. In fact you could sleep through the movie and still recite what happened. Which incidentally is basically what the person sitting three seats down from me did. Sanaa Lathan plays Leah a lobbyist who breaks up with her boyfriend because she wants to start a family and he doesnt. Two months later she meets Carter (Michael Ealy) a charmer who sweeps her off her feet. She thinks shes met the (wait for it) perfect guy but she dumps him after he displays a sudden violent temper beating the snot out of a man who was talking to Leah. Carter doesnt take the dumping well and begins stalking Leah with calls and unannounced visits. But this behavior goes on and on. Pretty soon its turned into a live action Pepe Le Pew movie. Leah goes for a walk. Carters there. Leah goes to a restaurant. Carters followed her there. At one point Leah gets the police involved and a cop remarks that he thinks theres more to whats going on here than a standard stalker situation which is incredible because there is nothing that happens here that is not standard. Tyger Williams script features some remarkably leaden exchanges and the actors look as though they want to be anywhere else. I certainly cant blame them. The only difference between this thrill-less thriller and a Lifetime movie is a 15 ticket.

Rosenthals Internet-age thriller falls head over heels for cheesy cliches. Sanaa Lathan is as tough as she is fetching which is why its so disheartening to watch her play a dopey victim for much of ""The Perfect Guy"" in which her well-to-do professional is terrorized by a new flame who doesnt take kindly to being dumped. Boasting a screenplay by Tyger Williams that never fails to telegraph its every move David M. Rosenthals film is a cheap ""Fatal Attraction"" knockoff complete with a subplot involving the potentially dire fate of Lathans beloved pet. While no bunnies wind up being boiled the rest of this second-rate genre effort is a strictly by-the-books affair. Despite an appealing trio of leads it seems likely to entice only those with an unquenchable thirst for thriller cliches. Leah (Lathan) is a successful California lobbyist whose relationship with Dave (Morris Chestnut) falls apart due to his disinterest in committing to the type of marriage-with-children future that she craves. No sooner has she dropped Dave than Leah is swept off her feet by Carter (Michael Ealy) a sexy suitor who first meets her at a coffee shop and following another chance encounter that ends with her literally swooning over his kisses reveals himself to be everything - devoted passionate respectful and interested in starting a family - that Leah wants in a partner. In case that wasnt immediately clear from Ealys perpetually humble-and-sweet routine (not to mention the films title) Leahs friend Alicia (Rutina Wesley) bluntly states ""He might be the perfect guy"" -- thereby cementing the filmmakers dedication to making everything about their story as leadenly obvious as possible. After a weekend at her parents house during which Leahs new beau wins over her dad (Charles S. Dutton) with front-row San Francisco Giants tickets Carter loses his cool at a gas station and viciously beats a man he mistakenly thinks is hitting on Leah. That violent outburst so rightfully frightens Leah that it ends their relationship and Carter takes the development quite badly. As an IT expert with all sorts of stalker-ish skills involving security systems and spy cameras Carter quickly becomes a menacing thorn in Leahs side especially once she reconciles with Dave. His attempts to make Carter stay away from Leah via public threats are as useless as the detectives looking into Carters behavior and the restraining order Leah eventually gets against him. As Ealys conduct tips over into lunatic territory director Rosenthal recasts him as not only an unhinged ex but a psychotic in a distinctly horror-movie mold. Standing in a doorway looking down on one of his victims Carter assumes a stoic Michael Myers pose. Later his surreptitious appearance outside Leahs shower -- in which shes canoodling with Dave -- turns him into a Norman Bates-ish madman. Meanwhile Dave is rendered as such a trivial would-be protector that his powerlessness practically oozes off the screen (this despite obligatory shots of a shirtless Chestnuts buff body) and Leah is forced to assume the role of helpless prey incapable of enlisting the help she needs or attaining the necessary strength herself to stop her former boyfriend from destroying her personal and professional lives. Eventually Williams script has Leah turn the tables on her tormentor thereby finally allowing Lathan to exhibit the gritty ferocity -- as demonstrated in films including ""Blade"" and ""AVP Alien vs. Predator"" -- that makes the accomplished actress more than just a pretty face. Unfortunately its far too little too late to salvage ""The Perfect Guy"" from its own dull suspense. It may be awash in Internet-age fears about surveillance and identity but at heart its little more than a retrograde B-movie.

Terri says September 13 2015 at 247 pm Someone didnt do there research. Lathan had a very small role in Blade. She played Snipes young mother in a flashback. Your confusing Lathan with NBushe Wright who was the female lead badass in the film. The two dont even look alike. Overall the review of the first film is spot on which is shame. Sanaa is a better quality actress than this crappy knockoff. Reply Ecotton says September 12 2015 at 812 pm Would be better off watching Ealy in The Following. Although the show was cancelled this past season stands alone even if you didnt watch the Fox series from the beginning and Ealy shows with creepy precision how he can transform from hazel- eyed heartthrob to cold blooded killer (ironically with similar tech savvy skills). And - surprise - hes given more of a backstory than just the convenient bi-polar disorder which makes his twisted actions in The Following have more motivation than they did in The Perfect Guy. Not a wasted two hours...but a very predictable thriller unfortunately. Reply gracieruth says September 12 2015 at 745 pm A knockoff of Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlbergs 1996 film FEAR. FEAR was much more intense suspenseful and had a plot. Ealy did not convince me in this villian role. Movie didnt make sense. Very disappointed in Lathaan and Ealy. Reply LVB says September 12 2015 at 936 pm I think gracieruth did not see the same movie I did. It was awesome. Michael Ealy was very convincing as the stalker/sociopath/the perfect guy. It was even more sinister than his role in the tv show The Following"". I will be definitely seeing this one again. Reply Thomasina says September 12 2015 at 921 am Thumbs up to this movie. Sanaa glad you are telling this story. I was in several situations like this. Hey girls its a jungle out there. Be careful.

Related Same Script New Psycho Lover Can Sanaa Lathan and Michael Ealy Pull a Beyonce With The Perfect Guy? The Perfect Guy and The Visit to Battle for Box-Office Domination Michael Ealy Plays The Perfect Guy for Sanaa Lathan in First Trailer (Video) This love-triangle thriller also starring Sanaa Lathan never comes to a sharp point Despite the presence of its three charming and impassioned leads and even as it looks and feels clean sharp and deftly shot ""The Perfect Guy"" -- which was it must be pointed out deliberately not screened for critics prior to release -- is a perfect example of how lame lazy material strands good actors resulting in a movie that looks great and feels less so. Also Read The Perfect Guy and The Visit to Battle for Box-Office Domination Directed by David M. Rosenthal and written by Tyger Williams ""The Perfect Guy"" stars Sanaa Lathan (""The Best Man Holiday"") as Leah a driven lobbyist living in L.A. and at the start of the film dating Dave (Morris Chestnut ""Nurse Jackie"") an architect whos crazy about her but not so enamored of the prospect of getting married. (Divorce runs in his family.) She on the other hand realizes after a friends anniversary party -- complete with touching toasts and cute kids -- that she wants the whole ball of wax ""Im 36; Ive been dating my whole life. I want a husband. I want kids."" This drives them apart but a few months later Leah bumps into Carter (Michael Ealy ""The Good Wife""); Carter is charming and awesome at first. Hes in IT has smoldering eyes is well-to-do a terrific dancer and on his way back from meeting Leahs parents in the Bay Area beats a stranger half to death with his bare hands in front of her for no real reason. She frightened by the swift shock of his fury breaks it off. He now even more enraged decides on a campaign of retribution until theres reconciliation ""If I cant have you nobody will."" Also Read Same Script New Psycho Lover Can Sanaa Lathan and Michael Ealy Pull a Beyonce With The Perfect Guy? This is perhaps the biggest problem with ""The Perfect Guy"" in that its a thriller with almost no thrills in it. Ealy with his handsome face and too-bright eyes goes from Total Package to Total Sociopath so swiftly and unambiguously that he segues from PDAs to B-and-E in a blink and the rest of the movie stamps around in clumsy circles from that point. Leah gets back together with Dave Carter harasses both of them LAPD Detective Hansen (Holt McCallany whose normal roguish charm is given no place to stand by the screenplay) explains why they cant press charges against Carter for his latest intrusion or imposition. Its a cycle that goes on until several characters have been beaten to death and the audience has been bored to it. Williams script also runs on stupidity the way an 18-wheeler runs on gas In great quantity and not always especially quietly. Leah is so resolutely oblivious for the duration of the movie that she might as well be drunk or blindfolded or both. This isnt a reflection on Lathan of course just as Ealys descent into sweaty slo-mo revenge-prep push-ups and ominous silent glowering is no fault of his; the script here is so slack and insipid that it sucks any and all tension out of the scenes the set-up and the plot. Also Read Foxs The Following Casts Michael Ealy as New Bad Guy Rosenthal has made an attractive film but no amount of beauty can make up for the films lack of brains. The cinematography by Peter Simonite (who shot second-unit on ""The Tree of Life"") is impressive capturing an L.A. that has both glamorous highlights and deep shadows. Editor Joan Sobel (""A Single Man"" ""Admission"") handles the films changes in location time and perspective with a deft and smart hand. But its hard to focus your vision on the films technical merits when youre rolling your eyes at the clumsiness of the storytelling and our three leads cant make the lead dead cliches of the dialogue come alive no matter how hard they try. ""The Perfect Guy"" could have been a competent engaging thriller or at least a showcase for its talented leads; the tragedy comes in how firmly and solidly it takes so many actors and artists down with it.

Nobody goes to these <i>Fatal Attraction</i> retreads anymore for serious drama. 132 Shares Share 105 Tweet 26 Share 1 Share Email Print Share Photo Dan McFadden/Columbia TriStar The Perfect GuyA is the kind of movie you keep wishing would just cut loose and go off the deep end. Nobody goes to theseA Fatal AttractionA retreads anymore for serious drama. But this one is a movie torn -- too grim and self-important to go truly nuts but too silly and slipshod to work on a more somber level. Sanaa Lathan plays Leah a hotshot exec at a political-consulting firm who ditches her boyfriend of two years David (Morris Chestnut) after it becomes clear that hes not ready to marry her. (""Im 36 years old"" she yells. ""Ive been dating my whole life. Im dated out"") Not long after shes saved from a drunk loser at a bar by suave looker Carter (Michael Ealy) with whom shed briefly exchanged flirty glances and banter at a coffee spot near her office. He soon charms his way into her life. He does indeed seem perfect He can take her to a club gyrate with her on the dance floor and make mad love in the bathroom one night; then go to her parents house and play ideal modest son-in-law material the next. One night however Carter loses it and beats the living crap out of a man at a gas station after a seemingly minor offense. Leah appropriately freaked out tries to distance herself from him. (It helps that right around this time Dave starts to come back in her life.) Unfortunately Carter is not only paranoid and violent hes a corporate-espionage expert as well and also evidently something of a ninja Soon hes breaking into Leahs house hiding under beds and rigging the place with cameras. Also he sabotages cars throws old ladies down stairs and steals her cat. I may be making this movie sound more promising and crazy than it is. The Perfect Guy manages to be both dull and frantic The story and the performances are geared for maximum portent but the filmmaking is choppy and haphazard. Casual conversations and dramatic moments are all shot and edited with the same hurried pace; scenes and characters are introduced so awkwardly that you start to suspect the film came in for some unwelcome postproduction tinkering. The very cadence of the film feels wrong. (RhythmA would be the wrong word since it has none.) Like someones trying to rush along so we can get to the good stuff. But there is no good stuff. When Carter goes Full Psycho Boyfriend he does so in the most predictable generic ways. And the performances offer little respite from the drudgery Ealy telegraphs his characters nuttiness early on by fixing his eyes on Lathan so insistently that were creeped out by him long before its time. That might have worked had he varied the performance somewhat but he remains his cold calculating self throughout. (Which in itself feels wrong since the character is supposed to have a hair-trigger temper but lets not even worry about consistency at this point.) As for the always-welcome Lathan she gets little chance to demonstrate her talents She gives some life to her early scenes as a woman frustrated by the stasis in her relationship. But eventually she too reverts to the standard-issue damsel-in-distress hysterics. Even so we might have accepted some easy predictable thrills -- had the film possessed the competence to deliver them. The Perfect Guy is a generic movie that somehow cant even provide generic pleasures.
