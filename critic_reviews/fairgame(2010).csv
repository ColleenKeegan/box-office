"Fair Game Dirty business as usual in Washington | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFair Game Dirty business as usual in WashingtonThe headline-derived Fair Game never gets as angry as it might despite the considerable outrage expended by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.Naomi Watts as Valerie Plame in Fair Game.  (Ken Regan / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 5 2010Fair Game (out of 4)Starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts. Directed by Doug Liman. 108 minutes. At AMC Yonge-Dundas and the Varsity. PGThe headline-derived Fair Game never gets as angry as it might despite the considerable outrage expended by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn in their roles as American patriots wronged by their government.But thats what makes it interesting. Doug Limans docudrama is almost shockingly even-handed in the way it depicts how the Bush Administration in 2003 callously unmasked CIA agent Valerie Plame (Watts) risking her life and that of her husband retired ambassador Joe Wilson (Penn). Article Continued BelowPlames sudden notoriety also exposed her covert foreign contacts many of whom now likely lie in shallow graves.Plame and Wilson had been publicly outed by Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby (David Andrews) Vice-President Dick Cheneys chief of staff through a leak given to syndicated newspaper columnist Robert Novak. It was revenge by the White House against Plame and Wilson for their failure to toe the party line on the Iraq War and Saddam Husseins non-existent weapons of mass destruction.This much we already know courtesy of saturation news coverage that now seems to be receding in the rear-view mirror. What many perhaps didnt know and that Fair Game illustrates so well is how routine such dirty tricks are in Washington decades after Watergate supposedly cast the jackals into the wilderness. The most worrisome thing is how good intentions inevitably seem to curdle into bad acts. Early in the story which begins in 2001 in a 007-style scene in Kuala Lumpur where Plame demonstrates her sleuthing kills we see a high degree of high-mindedness at least within the offices of the CIA.Everybody is concerned about what Iraqi ruler Saddam is up to regarding WMD but there is scant solid evidence that hes anywhere close to creating and/or stockpiling them.This suspicion is advanced by Wilson a veteran of the Africa file acting at government behest after he returns from a reconnaissance mission to Niger with a report that disputes rumours of uranium yellowcake -- fuel for nukes -- being funneled from there to Iraq.He and Plame are shocked when U.S. President George W. Bush seen in real TV flashbacks announces that there is indeed a Nigerian yellowcake link to Iraq and its part of the reason why the U.S. has decided to go to war against Saddam and his country.But a harsher reality is yet to come. Plames CIA bosses and Wilsons old government contact all obediently back the White House version of events realizing that its career suicide to do other. The more cautious Plame is more concerned about protecting her threatened foreign sources than pursuing an ideological end. Wilson opts to take on the feds through a series of angry newspaper columns and TV appearances. The couples marriage begins to fray and the safety of their two young daughters is compromised as they become fodder for zealots of both the left and right.We can assume the movie is reasonably faithful to the facts because the screenplay was adapted by brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth from books written by Plame and Wilson.Liman is almost too good at making it real. Acting as his own cinematographer -- not a good idea judging by the shaky close-ups -- he shoots with a metallic digital hue that makes the picture seem all the harsher.Considering the magnitude of the wrongs catalogued here hes also almost too even-handed. Liman worked up more passion making Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith which was a fake spy story.To his credit and that of Watts and Penn nothing is done to sex up Plame or Wilson. They seem all too human in their on-the-fly decision-making and constant bickering. Penn is especially good at capturing Wilson as a stuffed-shirt Washington insider the kind who constantly looks over top of his glasses who sudden has to live life as an outsider.This isnt a message movie per se but a strong point of view comes through regardless In the battle of principles vs. politics politics always win.Libby was ultimately convicted in a federal trial of obstruction of justice perjury and making false statements but the 30-month prison sentence that came with it was commuted by George W. Bush as one of his final acts as U.S. president. Nobody else went to jail either although strong evidence that Cheney Bush advisor Karl Rove and even Bush himself were as culpable as Libby.They all got little more than a wrist slap for what they did to Plame Wilson and the world. Alls fair in love and war as Shakespeare said and thats true even when the war is fake.Whats really scary is how nobody seems to care all that much and that includes the current occupant of the White House. Its just dirty business as usual.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Was allowing some of the worlds fiercest critics to sink their teeth into it really the best marketing move not to mention having it compete against films which contained say catfish-based cunnilingus?A year on and looking at it with none of the festival hurly burly the film emerges as an absorbing unhysterical thriller that largely rejects the cliches of the genre. Based on the headline-grabbing Valerie Plame affair which played out between 2003 and 2007 it stars Naomi Watts and Sean Penn as a happily married bourgeois couple based in Washington she is Plame a top-ranking CIA operative tasked with attaining intelligence to either support or reject the legitimacy of the US governments argument for war in the Middle East; he is an ex-US diplomat sent to Niger to investigate claims that the country was selling yellowcake uranium to Saddam.The film is split into two chapters the first has the feel of a more urgent political thriller as the pair undertake their respective fact-finding missions while the second is more a bleary-eyed melodrama charting family breakdown as their findings are manipulated by the White House. The unshowy script by sibling writers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth proposes that there is no such thing as fact only context an idea that wouldve been more penetrating were it shorn of the liberal hectoring that colours much of the dialogue.

But this was based on real events real lives and the CIA wrongly turning on one of its own. And it was deeply worrying that Washington also had a problem distinguishing between Niger and Nigeria. All of that aside I was bored rigid which is unusual as I closely follow current affairs and the ingredients for a reasonable film were there. Sean Penn was a little too angry. Naomi Watts was too cold to make me feel their marriage was vaguely solid before the pressure built up. At one point I thought Penn put on emotion as a small child puts on crocodile tears - far from convincing. Some four people walked out and there was more fidgetting in this movie than Ive known in such a small audience for a long time - people endlessly up and down to the loo - perhaps to stretch after a nap. However my boredom turned to pleasure - when the credits started to roll. Two (generous) stars or 3/10.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 15 2011scrumpyjackFeaturedSimply fails to grip as it should.

Updated July 30 2016  1153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movies Close Ken Regan Naomi Watts and Sean Penn in ""Fair Game"" (Summit Entertainment) Fair Game Fact-based Fair Game is a compelling thriller BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Nov 19 2010 (...) Ken Regan Naomi Watts and Sean Penn in ""Fair Game"" (Summit Entertainment) For a nation at war with its own values ""Fair Game"" is a compelling pertinent and scrupulously true political thriller in the honorable tradition of ""All the Presidents Men.""Valerie Plame smartly portrayed by Naomi Watts was a CIA operative who specialized in defusing the nuclear ambitions of terrorists and rogue regimes. When President George W. Bushs administration said Iraq was stockpiling uranium from Africa it didnt square with Plames information. She suggested to her bosses that her husband former ambassador Joseph Wilson (Sean Penn) was qualified to investigate.Wilson reported that the presidents claims were false. Soon thereafter administration officials leaked Plames secret identity in order to undermine Wilsons credibility and to consolidate their case for war. But it also had the effects of ending Plames career endangering her contacts and emboldening arms traffickers throughout the world.For some Americans especially those desensitized to war or distracted by money problems Plamegate and the subsequent conviction of vice presidential aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby (devious David Andrews) are a business-as-usual snooze. But action director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") does an effective job of re-creating the preinvasion hysteria and dissecting its effects on a conscientious couple. In staring down terrorists Plame is a poker-faced high-stakes gambler. But when her cover is blown and the propaganda machine goes into overdrive informers she had promised to protect become collateral damage. And in the Wilsons suburban D.C. neighborhood they are branded as traitors and hounded by death threats. Penn and Watts have starred in several films together and here they make a believable married couple. Like the actor who portrays him Wilson is an outspoken ex-surfer who wades into a national debate at great personal cost. Hes also the melancholy caretaker to their twin kids while Plame is off making the world a safer place. The intersection of the political and the personal has rarely been so clearly marked.The blind-siding of Valerie Plame wasnt fair and wasnt a game but this cinematic outcome is a touchdown for true patriots.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 5 2010 Save for later Saved Naomi Watts plays Valerie Plame whose involvement in the CIA was made public in 2003. Summit Entertainment          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Is the time right for a movie about the 2003 Valerie Plame-Joseph Wilson smack down? So many Washington scandals have transpired since then that ""Fair Game"" based on memoirs by both Plame and Wilson and starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn might seem like old news.Robert Luskin a lawyer for Karl Rove recently told a New York Times reporter that the Wilsons are ""a little past their sell-by date.""I suppose this is true if timeliness is gauged in direct proportion to our collective near-amnesia of news going back more than a few years (months? days?). But the Wilsons ordeal should not be relegated to the scrapheap of scandals past if only because the past to paraphrase something William Faulkner once said isnt even past. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? This is not to say that ""Fair Game"" directed by Doug Liman and written by the brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth is an outstanding piece of political moviemaking. Preachy sketchy disjunctive and with a blistery solarized sheen that makes it look microwaved rather than photographed ""Fair Game"" is a movie that for the most part trades on the Wilsons notoriety instead of delving into the heart of it. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Plame was a veteran CIA officer whose cover was blown in 2003 by the conservative columnist Robert Novak after her ambassador husband Wilson who had been sent by the CIA to Niger to investigate a possible nuclear weapons link to Saddam Hussein responded to distorted misinformation in the Bush administrations rapid ramp up to war with an op-ed piece in The New York Times titled ""What I Didnt Find in Africa.""Wilson had been the last American diplomat in Iraq when bombing commenced under George H.W. Bush who subsequently called him ""a true American hero."" The second President Bush took a far dimmer view of Wilson who was smeared as a headline-grabbing turncoat. Plame was mischaracterized as a bit player in the CIA. In fact as ""Fair Game"" makes clear she was much more than that. The leaks that led to her outing very likely put many of her covert contacts in mortal danger. (The leaks eventually resulted in the conviction of Dick Cheneys chief of staff ""Scooter"" Libby - well played in the film by David Andrews - on charges of obstruction of justice.)Liman is trying to frame ""Fair Game"" as both a political thriller and a marital thriller. As tensions mount the marriage which includes two children frays. Its as if were watching ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" with WMDs (or rather the absence of them).Wilson is a tough nut and his high-tension rectitude which certainly got the goat of the Bush administration also wears down Plame who unlike him couldnt retaliate on television and in print. (Because of security concerns even her memoir also called ""Fair Game"" was heavily redacted.)At the same time at the height of the scandal Plame and Wilson posed together in Vanity Fair in their Jaguar convertible she camouflaged in head scarf and dark glasses. This brazen gesture is barely touched on in the movie. If Liman had connected the couple in that photo with the indignant twosome of his film he might have succeeded in creating more than a passable piece of politico grandstanding.Plames profession was a mystery to her friends and the details of it were kept secret even from Wilson. Did she on some level relish her role as a home-grown Mata Hari? We never really find out.Only once in a scene where Plame explains how she maintains her cover does the film allude to an essential doubleness in her personality. ""You have to know why youre lying and never forget the truth"" she calmly explains. If only Liman had reconciled that Plame with the taunting model in the Jaguar and with the suburban mom - now that would have been a great character. [Editors note The original version omitted the word ""never"" from Valerie Plames quote.]Naomi Watts settles for semi-inscrutability while Penn engaging as he is is encouraged particularly toward the end to deliver his performance from the lectern. Liman doesnt seem to understand that the outrage in this movie speaks for itself. Its more than enough that the Wilsons were punished and pilloried for telling the truth. We dont need to see them sanctified by righteousness.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Fair Game Recommended Rated PG-13  108 minutes  2010 Youd have to go back to All the Presidents Men (1976) for a better example of fresh American political scandal being turned into slam-bang star-powered drama. Sean Penn plays Joseph Wilson the U.S. diplomat who publicly disputed the Bush administrations evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Naomi Watts is his wife Valerie Plame who was outed as a CIA agent in retaliation. The screenplay is adapted from Plames and Wilsons respective memoirs and their relationship in the movie--like the one between Woodward and Bernstein in the earlier one--is so compelling that it generates an emotional force quite apart from the political skulduggery. Scrupulous with the facts on weapons of mass destruction the movie arrives at the same impasse that the media and justice system did when vice presidential aide Scooter Libby was thrown to the wolves. But it does a real service in showing how important Plame was to the agencys counterproliferation efforts in Iraq and how screwed her foreign sources were when the story broke.

Sean Penn plays Joe Wilson her husband and former ambassador. ABOUT THE MOVIEFair Game   out of four Stars Naomi Watts Sean Penn Noah Emmerich Bruce McGill Sam Shepard David AndrewsDirector Doug LimanDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating PG-13 for some languageRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesExpands Friday to more cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Fair Game may benefit from fortuitous timing. The well-made biopic focuses on Valerie Plame who says she was exposed by White House officials as a CIA operative in apparent retaliation over her husbands public allegation that President George W. Bush manipulated intelligence about weapons of mass destruction to justify invading Iraq. The film arrives in theaters just as Bushs memoir Decision Points hits bookstores heightening a sense of immediacy. Bush addresses the WMD issue in the book saying he sent troops into combat ""based in large part on intelligence that proved false."" TRAILER Watch part of Fair Game That intelligence is at the crux of Fair Game. As directed by Doug Liman (Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith) the film does a convincing job of connecting the dots regarding the fallout surrounding Plame and her husband former ambassador Joe Wilson. Among the fallout Wilsons New York Times op-ed piece so angered administration officials that they blew Plames cover as a covert operative and ended her nearly 20-year career. Liman skillfully intercuts television news footage of the president and administration officials with a skilled cast of actors. The sharp screenplay by Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth is based on books by Wilson and Plame. But the saga feels muted even while it tries to elicit outrage. Naomi Watts plays the circumspect Plame with a mixture of ferocity and reserve. Sean Penn swaggers as the blustery Wilson. An expert on Africa Wilson is sent to Niger upon Plames suggestion to superiors on a fact-finding mission to determine whether Saddam Hussein had sought to purchase uranium there. He finds no such evidence. So when Bush in his State of the Union address declares that Saddam shopped for nuclear materials in Africa Wilson is determined to correct the statement. After his Opinion piece runs Plame loses her job and Wilson is enraged. Dragged into the limelight Watts Plame is almost too contained as she quietly reels over the implosion of her career and mounting marital tension. The political machinations work well with Limans brisk pacing and his handheld documentary-style camera work. The more low-key domestic drama doesnt feel as authentic. While Plame clearly comes across as the governments sacrificial lamb she is strangely without much personality. We dont get a sense of her as a human being. We see her as a dutiful agent almost distractedly bidding her children goodbye as she heads on government missions then later being avoided by co-workers and struggling with frustration over her job loss. Being out of work and enduring marital struggles makes her relatable to audiences but the script scrimps on fleshing out the familial scenes and imbuing Plame with discernible passion about her chosen career. Her relationship strain doesnt always meld artfully with the storys larger political intrigue. Also the omission of such major real-life players in the scandal as journalists Judith Miller and Robert Novak who had key roles in the Plame saga is baffling. More admirable than riveting Fair Game works best as a portrait of power games at the highest levels. Its strength lies in presenting and exposing an account of political betrayal rather than exploring the human fallout.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 05 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Nov. 05 2010 1046AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The new Doug Liman movie Fair Game was the only American film in competition at the Cannes Film Festival this year though less for its art than its stars (Naomi Watts and Sean Penn) and political message. Based on memoirs by former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson (Penn) and Valerie Plame Wilson (Watts) a CIA agent outed by White House officials the movie tells how a couple of patriotic civil servants were betrayed by the Bush administration and pilloried by its media flunkies. Fair Game is no better than fairly good. It starts with thriller cliches and ends in sanctimonious preaching but in between there are a couple of true things a portrait of a marriage under stress and a depiction of the arrogance of power that leaves a sharp after-burn. Liman ( The Bourne Identity) begins his film in familiar thriller mode with a swooping camera in Kuala Lumpur where a stylish Canadian business woman (Plame working undercover) is thwarting the advances of a sleazy businessman. When Plame returns home to her Washington suburb the set-up suggests one of those domestic spy comedies like True Lies or Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith. Valerie and Joseph arrange play dates for the twins communicate with each other through Post-it notes and phone messages and go out for drinks with friends when Joe typically gets on his soap box. Meanwhile on TV the President and his gang are selling the case for the imminent invasion of Iraq and the CIA is pressed to find any evidence of Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction. The agency approaches Joe an African expert to go to Niger and find out if the country has sold yellowcake uranium ore to Iraq. Later he accuses the White House of misrepresenting his findings in an op-ed piece in The New York Times. Eight days later he gets the return blow Washington Post columnist Robert Novak acting on information from White House officials outs his wife as a CIA agent. A subplot about an Iraqi scientist and his American sister serves to stand in for Plames sources who have been exposed and betrayed. Much of the first half of the movie takes place in Langley or White House offices as government representatives push the CIA to spin its information. It features a nicely snaky performance by David Andrews as Lewis (Scooter) Libby Vice-President Dick Cheneys chief-of-staff who later took the fall for the misdeed (President George W. Bush commuted his sentence). The films title comes from another of the anti-Plame conspirators Karl Rove who allegedly told MSNBCs Chris Mathews that ""Wilsons wife is fair game."" The second more compelling part of the movie shows the Wilson marriage under duress. Penn and Watts (who have worked together twice before in 21 Grams and The Assassination of Richard Nixon) easily establish the occasionally fractious intimacy of a real marriage and are convincing in showing how their bond is frayed by the assault of reporters death threats and slurs from the right-wing media. Joe the emotional fighter wants to go to war on the cable television and lecture circuit. Much of the self-righteous bluster feels like Sean Penn playing Sean Penn. The more compelling performance comes from Watts as Valerie a tightly controlled woman trained in a lifetime of secrecy and a faith in her resilience (""I dont have a breaking point"") who for the first time has to cope with exposure and vulnerability. You feel for her helplessness while Penns character appears to exult in articulating his outrage.

"Fair Game review story of outed cia operative doesnt provide all of the facts |       NJ.com comments Fair Game review story of outed cia operative doesnt provide all of the facts Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 05 2010 at 804 AM View/Post Comments Ken ReganSean Penn and Naomi Watts star as Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame a real-life husband and wife whose run in with the Bush administration became a scandal in ""Fair Game."" Its a nail-biting moment in secret-agent movies The moment when deep in enemy territory the carefully camouflaged spy realizes that the mask has slipped and the bad guys are on to him. But what if the enemy territory suddenly turns out to be your own country? If the bad guys are in fact your guys? That was how it must have suddenly seemed to veteran CIA operative Valerie Plame who saw a career of nearly two decades disappear after Bush administration sources casually outed her as an agent. The intent had been to discredit her husband Joe Wilson a former ambassador who had accused George W. Bushs White House of willfully ignoring the facts in their rush to war with Iraq. But the collateral damage was even greater. Because not only was Plame now unable to ever work undercover again every contact shed ever made in hostile countries was now a target. Plame is ferociously acted by Naomi Watts who gives the character her usual blend of personal vulnerability and maternal fearlessness. And Wilson - portrayed here as rather loudly and rudely self-righteous -- is well-embodied by Sean Penn. Movie Review FAIR GAME (PG-13) Summit (106 min.) Directed by Doug Liman. With Naomi Watts Sean Penn. Now playing in New York; scheduled to open in New Jersey Nov. 12. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys review TWO AND A HALF STARS They give the movie its flawed humanity particularly as their marriage begins to unravel under the strain (although it does seem as if there were a few problems there before the Bush administration). But the movies own flaws are more problematic. Director Doug Liman knows Washington inside-out - his father was a prosecution lawyer during the Iran/Contra mess -- but his camera seems to be lost often whipping around scenes in vain hopes of finding the actors. The intent is to give a feel of hand-held haphazard life. The result though is actually completely at odds with the movies theme. This is a film about a conspiracy to advance an agenda -- and that is not the sort of thing that happens on the fly made up as you go along. The camera moves need to be as slow and sinuous as a snake. The script meanwhile plays it too safe. The Plame case goes back to Bushs first term; if were to care about it now you have to make it about important unchanging issues. But instead of showing how an unchecked executive branch is always prone to corruption the movie contents itself with kicking around Dick Cheney and G.W. Bush again. Theyre outsized targets to be sure -- but not the only culprits. The film for example avoids blaming others involved in the crucial leak including the media. Or mentioning that while Plame and Wilson are still attempting to sue Bush and Cheney in civil court their efforts have been opposed -- by the Obama Justice Department. Theres a radical lesson in this story about the ways of permanent government and protect-their-own professionals and its a vital one. But thats one that this film is too polite safe and self-satisfied to ever bring to the screen -- let alone get in focus.

(HO) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday November 5 2010 400 AM Title Fair Game Based-in-truth thriller about CIA spy Valerie Plame. With Naomi Watts Sean Penn. Director Doug Liman (144). PG-13 Language. At area theaters.Though based on a true story with a well-known outcome Doug Limans ""Fair Game"" is as suspenseful as any fictional thriller -- and considerably more tragic.The film opens in 2001 as undercover agent Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) unsuccessfully researches weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Her husband Joe Wilson (Sean Penn) is also sent on a fact-finding mission during which he finds nothing at all.After the Bush administration dismisses the reports they present Wilson angers the White House by taking his concerns public. Before he knows it his wife is exposed as an agent and doubt is publicly cast on his own motivations. Their lives only go downhill from there.Partisans are likely to cast doubt on director Limans motivations in dramatizing this story not to mention those of the outspokenly liberal Penn. But Liman and his screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworth handle the facts with intelligence and artistic integrity.They dont simply relay details but contextualize them giving thoughtful consideration to shifting media standards corruption of power and the insidious new clout that even false accusations carry in the Internet era.Those hoping for a documentary-style analysis will be disappointed. Liman condenses or skips over several key factors including the essential roles of journalists Robert Novak and Judith Miller. But its no easy feat to keep audiences on edge while retelling a familiar story or to shock us as old outrages come tumbling into the light once again.

I couldnt tear my eyes from it maybe because I couldnt maintain focus on anything else in this histrionic and shamelessly misleading wonk-work. The topic (which takes a full hour to set up) is the leaking to the press of the name and occupation of CIA agent Valerie Plame (Watts) after her hairy husband Joe Wilson (Penn) published an article that purported to debunk a point made by then-President George W. Bush about an effort by Saddam Hussein to obtain nukes in Niger. Bored? Dont blame me. You cant make a compelling drama about laffaire Plame -- a Tom Wolfe-ish farce about the scramble to get on ""Meet the Press"" would be the only possible approach. A couple of years ago a fictionalized version dealt with the vacuum of cinematic qualities by sexing up the story (the Plame character gets murdered). ""Fair Game"" a more serious-minded and meticulous account nevertheless simply leaves out facts inconsistent with the overall thrust (and I do mean thrust -- prepare for outrage to be rammed down your throat). Unless your pulse races at the mention of Robert Novak youll be underwhelmed. Plame is initially seen improbably as a rugged super-spy racing from Kuala Lumpur to Lang- ley to Jordan to juggle field assets. Wilson goes to Niger finds the charge of uranium seeming to be trumped-up and says so discrediting the Bush White House and inspiring it to seek revenge by outing his wife as a spook. (In reality the Washington Post editorialized that Wilson ""falsely"" claimed to have debunked the Niger story.) Director Doug Liman torn between his two selves as the director of ""The Bourne Identity"" and the scion of the liberal lawyer for the Senate in the Iran-Contra hearings in the 1980s finds a halfway point ""The Bored Identity."" As Liman ""urgently"" shakes his camera and brings up tribal drumbeats on the soundtrack his cast ruminates on the thickness of aluminum rods used in centrifuges and whether Novaks column was syndicated overseas. Its like watching C-SPAN set to ""Survivor"" theme music. The major source of tension -- the one that leads to Penn and Watts shouting at each other while his do sits like an angry badger -- is about media strategy. When Wilson mentions that Vanity Fair is interested Plame treats the idea as offensive. In reality Plame did do the glossy photo spread. As the politically persecuted go Plame was not exactly Nelson Mandela. And though the film both shows her both bragging about not breaking during her CIA training and crumbling emotionally when called a mediocrity on TV heres a little detail it leaves out The Plame leak wasnt political persecution. (The Washington Post again The charge ""that the Bush White House orchestrated the leak of Ms. Plames identity to ruin her career"" ""is untrue."") No one was ever charged with the crime of knowingly outing an undercover agent (something Penn gets very shouty about) because no one did that. After seven years this phony frenzy for a 21st century Watergate has ended. Penn has gotten out of his system a movie that few will see and the saga can revert to being what it always was -- a footnote to an asterisk to a parenthetical clause of history. ""Game"" over.

Valeries husband diplomat JOE WILSON (Sean Penn) is drawn into the investigation to substantiate an alleged sale of enriched uranium from Niger. But when the administration ignores his findings and uses the issue to support the call to war Joe writes a New York Times editorial outlining his conclusions and ignites a firestorm of controversy. Starring Naomi Watts Sean Penn Ty Burrell Michael Kelly Bruce McGill Brooke Smith David Denman Noah Emmerich David Andrews Louis Ozawa Changchien Director Doug Liman Running time 148 Release Opened Nov 5 2010  Editorial Review Riveting drama minus the rhetoricBy Ann HornadayFriday November 5 2010Naomi Watts delivers an uncanny portrayal of former CIA operative Valerie Plame in ""Fair Game"" a crackling political thriller that deftly navigates the knife edge between all-too-familiar recent history and more universal personal drama. As Plames husband former ambassador Joe Wilson Sean Penn turns in a similarly skillful performance his own impulsive occasionally fiery temperament harmonizing well with Wilsons own polarizing persona. Viewers who considered avoiding ""Fair Game"" because of a distaste for ax-grinding or score-settling neednt worry. For the most part director Doug Liman steers clear of re-litigating the leak of Plames name to the media during the George W. Bush administration instead focusing on how her being a spy and then being outed affected the Wilsons marriage. ""Fair Game"" begins in Kuala Lumpur where Plame works in nuclear non-proliferation for the CIA under cover of being an energy executive. After a dicey situation in which she succeeds in ""turning"" an asset - persuading a local contact to become an informer - she returns home where Wilson is starting a freelance consulting career and caring for the couples young twins. When Plame is reassigned to work on a task force studying whether Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction in Iraq she is told by higher-ups that the orders are coming from ""across the river""; soon she spies I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby (David Andrews) roaming the CIA halls presumably on orders from his boss vice president Dick Cheney to find those WMDs and fast. Wilson meanwhile travels to Niger at the request of the CIA - with Plame vouching for his bona fides a fact that would later be used against her - to investigate claims that Hussein has purchased yellowcake uranium from that country. ""Fair Game"" presents an impressively faithful tick-tock of the events leading up to Wilsons decision to write a fateful op-ed contradicting Bushs statements about that sale (he found no such evidence on his trip) and the subsequent leaking of Plames name to columnist Robert Novak. The filmmakers remind viewers that Wilson was an early and vocal critic of Hussein and Plame herself was pretty sure the dictator was developing a weapons program; neither was a reflexive critic of the Bush Doctrine. The most explosive charge leveled in ""Fair Game"" is that Iraqi assets developed by Plame were hung out to dry and may have lost their lives after the leak. Those characters reportedly are composites but they represent a sobering reminder of what was at stake beyond the political theater staged by way of Fox News and MSNBC. The most compelling scenes dont transpire in shadowy White House tete-a-tetes or exotic locales but in the Wilsons stately Palisades home where the secrecy of Plames job and the emotional demands of marriage clash with unsettling exhausting force. ""I dont know where you go"" a bleary-eyed Wilson tells Plame when she leaves for yet another undisclosed location. By that time the relationship is being conducted via Post-it notes and strategic handoffs of kids and household responsibilities in other words the daily grind of compromise and logistical juggling that defines most modern two-career families. Liman until now best known for such action fantasies as ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" reaches a new high with ""Fair Game"" by far his most sophisticated movie yet. With no flashy pyrotechnics or over-the-top action sequences at his disposal he lets the characters and the story take over wisely keeping distractions to a minimum. The result is a lean well-crafted engaging thriller culminating in an emotionally devastating climax that lands with an enraging shock despite the fact that its so well known by now. ""Fair Game"" is the kind of taut serious adult drama Hollywood rarely produces anymore. Quality-starved audiences should flock to it if only to ensure that more of them get made.Contains profanity.

Watch a clip from the film ""127 Hours"" starring James Franco. Video courtesy of Fox Searchlight. The title refers to the time it took Aron Ralston the real-life mountain climber played sensationally well by James Franco to extricate himself from a slot canyon into which he had tumbled during a solitary wilderness hike in Utah seven years ago. Extrication required amputation--Mr. Ralstons left-handed severing of his right forearm which was pinned between a chalkstone boulder and the canyon wall. Because this agony is depicted vividly albeit briefly you may go in with your eyes wide open but not keep them that way throughout. (My own approach was a combination of sidewise glances and defensive squints.) To justify such a harrowing sequence any mainstream movie would have to be exceptional and this one certainly is--its exciting stirring often funny sometimes lyrical and unusually thoughtful. And with that one egregious exception genuinely pleasurable. The film is an intriguing match-up of style and substance. On the face of it Mr. Ralstons experience which he recounted in his book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" would seem as confining for the camera as it was for the hero. (The book was adapted by the director and Simon Beaufoy.) And the feeling of confinement can be extreme. Against all physical logic were wedged right in there with Aron watching his struggles from a fairly hard place of our own. Yet that confinement co-exists with surreal freedom. Mr. Boyles gorgeously reckless ecstatic style --developed in such earlier films as ""Trainspotting"" and ""Millions"" as well as ""Slumdog Millionaire""--allows him to break out of the canyon with the greatest of ease by tapping into the flow of Arons memories fantasies fears and epiphanies. Thus his camera tilts skyward to see the slow transit of a raven that Aron saw every morning and drills down to the whirling video drum of the fallen climbers minicamcorder (or the point of his blunt knife as it approaches a bone inside his arm). Yet the camera also hurtles across a mesa at warp speed to the bottle of water that Aron recalls having left in his truck; constructs exquisite dreamscapes from cherished moments in his family life; revisits his lover whos played by Clemence Poesy and the pretty young hikers he chanced to meet just before his fall; studies voluptuous sandstone shapes and in a single literally breathtaking shot pulls up and out of Arons strait prison for a birds-eye view of the vast and silent land that surrounds it. (The directors of photography were Anthony Dod Mantle who shot ""Slumdog"" and Enrique Chediak. As in ""Slumdog"" A.R. Rahmans score drives the narrative with relentless force.) ENLARGE James Franco as stranded climber Aron Ralston in 127 Hours Fox Searchlight Visual and dramatic fugues notwithstanding the film is essentially a one-man show and Mr. Franco was an inspired choice to play the man. Theres no one quite like him in--or conspicuously out of--Hollywood these days. As a charmingly cheerful exponent of the Robert Mitchum screw-it-all school of acting he finds time to direct make fine art contribute articles to various publications (including this one) and is currently pursuing doctoral studies at Yale. But whats so valuable to his performance in ""127 Hours"" is his very American cheerfulness combined with quick intelligence. When Aron takes off for his fateful adventure his high spirits which the actor and his director convey brilliantly are an expression of his heedlessness--he hasnt bothered to tell anyone where hes going. Its entertaining in a foreboding way to watch this outdoorsman set out with equipment that John Muir could never have dreamed of--superstrong climbing ropes gleaming pulleys digital wristwatch-cum-altimeter a tiny Petzl lamp affixed to his cap. His cool gear gives him a seductive sense of security while his little still camera in tandem with his digicam will let him narrate what may be the last hours of his life. Thats not why the cameras went into Arons backpack of course. They were there because this is an age of ritual self-dramatization so entertainment becomes fascination as Mr. Franco charts Arons progression from happy narcissism to solemn awareness of mortal peril. And to an acceptance of personal responsibility ""Its me"" Aron reminds himself. ""I chose this. I chose all of this."" His solemnity seems just as authentic as the jauntiness it banishes which is saying a lot. (The only passage that struck me as false though enjoyable was one that makes indirect reference to ""Slumdogs"" game-show madness.) ""127 Hours"" treats profound issues with unforced wisdom and uncommon grace. The story is one of survival through almost unthinkable self-mutilation but the subject is self-discovery. By the time Aron raises himself up from the bowels of the earth into the blazing sun he knows who he is and we do too. Fair Game Watch a clip from the film ""Fair Game"" starring Naomi Watts. Courtesy Summit Entertainment Naomi Watts is Valerie Plame and Sean Penn is her husband Joe Wilson in ""Fair Game"" a political drama that explores the mysteries of the Washington scandal that erupted in 2003 shortly after the start of the Iraq war. Since Doug Limans direction is astute the acting is first-rate the script--by Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth--is smart and the story is an important one its also mysterious that the film is less than the sum of its well-crafted parts. Part of the answer lies in the storys peculiar nature. Anyone who saw ""All the Presidents Men"" let alone read the book or lived through the period can tell you what it was about--a pair of reporters whose revelations helped to topple Richard Nixons presidency. The same clarity cant be found in the source material for ""Fair Game"" which was based on the book of the same name by Ms. Plame and ""The Politics of Truth"" by Mr. Wilson. Theirs is an ambiguous tale of intrigue and betrayal culminating in her being outed as a CIA agent thanks to White House leaks that were widely seen as revenge against Mr. Wilson. (A former ambassador and career diplomat he had written a New York Times op-ed piece denying the truth of one of the Bush administrations most compelling justifications for invading Iraq.) ENLARGE Naomi Watts as the embattled Valerie Plame in Fair Game. Summit Entertainment More on ""Fair Game"" A Qamp;A with Valerie Plame Wilson and Joe Wilson A Qamp;A with Director Doug Liman ""Fair Game"" has its own chilling power accompanied as it is by a drumbeat about weapons of mass destruction that turned out to be nonexistent. Mr. Liman and his colleagues evoke that tumultuous not-so-long ago time with a documentary style that incorporates TV speeches by President George W. Bush Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (""We dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."") And the co-stars could hardly be better--especially Ms. Watts who must be the most agreeably self-effacing star in todays movie universe. Yet most of the scenes depicting the couples domestic life are borderline-banal and they miniaturize the political drama that plays out partly in public partly in the shadows but almost always in a middle distance just beyond emotional reach. Due Date Watch a clip from the film ""Due Date"" starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. Courtesy Warner Bros. Todd Phillips who put himself on the comedy map by directing ""The Hangover"" is back with ""Due Date"" a road movie with mismatched buddies played by Zach Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. Mr. Galifianakis was endearing as well as hilarious in ""The Hangover"" but Ethan the extravagantly fey goofball he plays this time soon wears thin--chubby but thin. Mr. Downey can turn anything into a laugh line but the character he plays here a father-to-be named Peter whos trying to get home in time for his childs birth is little more than a foil for his co-stars antics--a foil both angry and dull. ENLARGE Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis as mismatched road-trippers in Due Date. Warner Bros. Pictures The basic problem is the script which is credited to three writers plus the director--seldom a good sign. Never mind that its a retread of ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles"" minus the trains and minus John Candy. Retreads can hold the road but this one doesnt despite some sporadically funny stuff. What for example are we to make of Ethan confronted for the first time by the Grand Canyon saying ""I couldve sworn I read it was man-made""? Or mistaking Mexico for Texaco after getting himself and Peter high on cannabis clouds in the confines of their car? Jokes like these leave you yearning for less. Four Lions This media-obsessed comedy set in London and directed by Christopher Morris  is an adolescent stab at a grown-up subject. Its The Gang That Couldnt Bomb Straight a boob quartet of Islamic extremists--three Muslims by birth and a kind of soccer hooligan turned nutjob jihadist. (In a twist of whimsy offered as irony another young Muslim who comes on as a fanatic proves to be a passionate pacifist.) Mr. Morris and his writers--four of them in this film as well--like to torture logic with absurdist dialogue and some of their gangs escapades are amusing rather than laughable. Yet ""Four Lions"" lacks a moral base. If the terrorists are hapless clowns the cops are silly fools and the closest the movie comes to political satire is the terrorists penchant for videotaping themselves. The only reason to see it is Riz Ahmeds performance as Omar the supposed brains of the operation. Mr. Ahmed reminded me a bit of Robert Carlyle. Hes dynamic quick-tongued and intense. And much too classy for this tatty room. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Date Night (2010) ENLARGE James Francos breakthrough on the small screen came with a starring role in ""Freaks and Geeks."" On the big screen of course he came to prominence in the ""Spider-Man"" movies as Harry Osborn Peter Parkers best friend and the son of Spideys arch-enemy. In keeping with his unbedazzled attitude toward acting he has also played a wide range of lesser roles. In this comedy about the superbly absurd adventures of a suburban couple played by Steve Carell and Tina Fey Mr. Franco and Mila Kunis are a low-life duo named Taste and Whippit. Go (1999) Before Doug Liman directed ""The Bourne Identity"" he did this piquant bouillabaisse of nihilist comedy. Always leaping before they look the barely postadolescent blunderers of ""Go"" keep suffering dire consequences from dimly perceived causes. They may be many things--spontaneous irrepressible and pretty funny--but they arent poster children for impulse control. The prime mover is an 18-year-old supermarket clerk named Ronna (Sarah Polley deftly deadpan all the way). John August wrote the script set in Los Angeles and Las Vegas on the day before Christmas. Mr. Liman did his own cinematography as he did in ""Fair Game."" Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958) This leisurely sweet-spirited Italian comedy directed by Mario Monicelli was conceived as a spoof of the now-classic ""Rififi"" a mesmerizing French-language heist film directed three years earlier by the American Jules Dassin that created the template for decades of heist films to come. Mr. Monicellis take-off in its turn became the granddaddy of movies about bumbling thieves. The marvelous cast includes Marcello Mastroianni Vittorio Gassman Renato Salvatori and as a once-crackerjack safecracker closing in on senility the legendary clown Toto. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

(MCT) Photo Handout MCT Movie review Naomi Watts is a spy in Fair Game 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Fair Game Drama. Starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. Directed by Doug Liman. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Bad old days are too quickly forgotten but ""Fair Game"" is there to remind us - not only of the manipulation of evidence and the falsehoods that led to the Iraq war but the high cost of telling the truth in a time of fear. The story of Valerie Plame Wilson and Joseph Wilson gets the big-screen treatment in this fast-moving political drama from director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") and the result is riveting entertainment. As most will remember Valerie Wilson who has also been referred to by her maiden name Valerie Plame was a covert CIA agent whose cover was blown in 2003 by a leak traced to the Bush White House. Joseph Wilson her husband was a former ambassador sent to Niger by the CIA to investigate an alleged sale of uranium to Iraq which turned out to be completely false. When this false claim turned up in the presidents 2003 State of the Union address Joseph Wilson set the record straight in a New York Times opinion piece. The leak of Valerie Wilsons CIA affiliation was thought to be in revenge for her husbands whistle-blowing. Valerie Plame Wilson (Naomi Watts) and Joseph Wilson (Sean Penn) are presented as sober people who in their different professional capacities took the Iraq threat seriously and went about investigating each claim that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear weapons program. But because Joseph Wilson told the truth they both found themselves all alone up against the government and its media sounding board. The spectacle is irresistible as Liman and screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworth unspool a story all about truth versus lies professionals versus amateurs villains versus heroes and patriots versus posturing careerists. Penn plays Joseph Wilson with a good eye for the real Wilsons two-fisted intellectual quality and for the way his veneer of calm persuasiveness barely covered his outrage. Hes effectively contrasted with David Andrews who plays Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby as the worst kind of bully an amoral weakling hiding behind his boss skirt. Based on the respective books by the Wilsons the movie gives an idea of what its like to work in intelligence and not be able to say a word about it. At a dinner party the couple listen to friends spout off nonsense that theyve heard in the media and though the Wilsons know what theyre hearing is untrue they have to keep silent. Its not easy. The movie also takes us into the CIAs offices to show beleaguered agents in 2002 and 2003 doing everything they can to furnish intelligence on demand and arrive at conclusions preordained by the White House. If this movie werent fact-based there could only be one ending. The administration falls and top officials go to prison and stay there. In the absence of that the screenwriters fashion the story as the tale of a marriage and of the terrible pressures it suffered. Thats as good a clothesline as any on which to hang these fascinating events. Watts is the movies soul thoughtful and deep-revolving admiring but suspicious of her husbands bluster. A career woman whose job was at the center of her life she was happy to be a private hero until she was forced to become a public one. -- Advisory Adult themes but suitable for anyone old enough to understand it.

We meet CIA agent Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) an operative specializing in the Middle East whose husband former Ambassador Joseph Wilson (Sean Penn) is dispatched on a mission to Niger to search for yellowcake uranium. No uranium turns up - proof Wilson believes that the Bush administrations claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are false. Movie Information Fair GameRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Doug LimanStarring Naomi Watts and Sean PennRun time 104 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (strong language adult themes)Synopsis Naomi Watts plays outed undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame.More movies from GuideLive.comWhat happens next remains one of the most controversial chapters of the Bush era Wilson writes a scathing article critical of administration officials. In what her supporters say is retaliation Plames cover is then blown by the administration. The screenplay by British playwright Jez Butterworth and his brother John-Henry based on memoirs by Plame and Wilson glosses over some key details in the case the protracted saga involving New York Times reporter Judith Miller and columnist Robert Novak who were both leaked information about Plames identity; and the bizarre Vanity Fair photo shoot that seemed to present Wilson and Plame in glammed-up Hollywood superstar fashion. This may be the rare Hollywood movie that could have been another 20 or 30 minutes longer.What the filmmakers do capture brilliantly is the human cost of espionage and political gamesmanship. Liman previously directed Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith and in many respects Fair Game plays like the real-life version of that madly improbable fantasy. Plame journeys around the globe but can never tell Wilson where shes headed next. Wilson meanwhile tries to balance his ferocious idealism with the duties of being a husband and father. In publishing his New York Times piece he was trying to honor his country but in the process may have betrayed his family a paradox this movie deftly illuminates.Watts who bears a surprising resemblance to the real-life Plame is excellent as a career woman who even after being betrayed by her employers still feels incredibly loyal to them. For most of the film Penn - basically playing a variation on the loudmouth liberal that many people assume him to be - keeps it surprisingly reined-in neatly capturing Wilsons mixture of arrogance and determination without making him insufferable.Its only in the final stretch that the movie runs out of steam. Part of this is because the real-life events turned out to be not especially dramatic After much hand-wringing Plame decides to come clean and tell her side of the story. But the filmmakers also do themselves no favors with a scene near the end in which Wilson pontificates about the importance of holding government accountable. Until then Fair Game is the rare political drama that doesnt need a soapbox to make its points deeply felt. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Movie review Fair Game - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Fair GameMovie review Fair GameThe domestic drama of Doug Limans true-to-life tale of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame cant compete with the far more intriguing and disturbing tale of the misuse of governmental power.November 05 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Fair Game"" is an unintentionally perplexing film. Strongly written about a potent and still-relevant subject smartly directed by Doug Liman and forcefully acted by Naomi Watts Sean Penn and a carefully selected supporting cast it seems to be doing everything right but still doesnt manage to leave you with a completely satisfied feeling. Certainly ""Fair Games"" subject matter is inherently dramatic. It relates the ripped-from-the-headlines story of Valerie Plame (Watts) a covert CIA officer who found her cover blown and her professional life destroyed by ""the most powerful men in the history of the world."" According to the script by Jez Butterworth and his brother John-Henry that would be the men in the Bush White House key operatives like Karl Rove and Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby men who placed Plame in their cross hairs to divert the publics attention from her husband Joe Wilson (Penn). Hed had the temerity to suggest that the administration was in effect cooking the books and ignoring critical facts in its zeal to invade Saddam Husseins Iraq. With Hussein now long dead and the American military focus shifted to Afghanistan this may sound like so much ancient history but the reverse is true. Now that we know that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq the extent to which we were manipulated into a needless war that continues to wreak havoc in our world is more rather than less disturbing like a perpetual nightmare that gets worse each time it replays in our minds."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt; In fact the hitch in ""Fair Game"" is that the nakedness of what was publicly done to Plame and Wilson may be more compelling than the filmmakers counted on. They chose to focus much of their efforts on how having the White House gunning for the couple affected their personal relationship but they shouldnt have. Though that dynamic is of interest it is frankly dwarfed by the outrage you have to feel at both the misuse of governmental power and the pro-war propaganda offensive and that unbalances the film. The way that Plame was considered in Roves words to Chris Matthews ""fair game"" in a world of brutal realpolitik is so disturbing it overwhelms the personal drama that accompanied it. Certainly the first time we see Plame in the typically brisk and to-the-point interlude that opens the film she is the picture of steely covert operative competence handling a tricky situation in Kuala Lumpur like it was the kind of thing she did every day. Which in fact it pretty much was. Back home in Washington Plame pretends to even her close friends that she is a committed venture capitalist. If she is close-mouthed her husband is the opposite. A night out with other couples in a bar on the October day in 2001 when the war in Afghanistan began shows him to be a and clearly not for the first time a a trouble-making loose cannon a self-righteous individual with a noticeable temper management problem. Their personalities may differ but ""Fair Game"" takes pains to portray Plame and Wilson as loving parents as well as partners in a good marriage. He is trying to ramp up a consulting business while she punches a CIA time clock even getting promoted to chief of operations for the Iraqi branch of the Counterproliferation Division. In that capacity Plame has to deal with persistent pressure from ""across the river"" i.e. the vice presidents office to prove that Iraq is hell-bent on acquiring a nuclear weapon and had in fact bought huge amounts of yellowcake uranium from the African nation of Niger. One of her associates wonders if Wilson once the U.S. ambassador to Gabon could investigate. Plame is uncertain a its unpaid work in a hellhole a but when she mentions it to her husband he agrees and comes away convinced that the purported sale could not possibly have happened. When Wilson later hears President Bush mention the uranium deal in a televised speech as if it were fact he is so shocked he writes an outraged op-ed in the New York Times headlined ""What I Didnt Find in Africa."" At which point all hell breaks loose. Fearing that the column will damage the White House Vice President Dick Cheneys chief of staff Libby (expertly played by David Andrews with the darkness of Harry Potters nemesis Voldemort) changes the story. Acting in concert with Rove ( Adam LeFevre) the pair decides to focus on Wilson and his relationship with Plame. As a result White House-friendly columnist Robert Novak outs Plame in an article and everyone around her especially her colleagues in the CIA abandons her and runs for cover."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; Because this story is so real and so disturbing it makes other parts of ""Fair Game"" weak by contrast. This is especially true of an invented subplot about an Iraqi nuclear scientist and his family. The problem with this segment which had to be invented because Plames real work is still classified by the CIA is not that it is fake but that it feels tidy and manufactured on the screen even without our being told that that is the case. Though the differing ways Plame and Wilson responded to the White House attack and how those differences impacted their marriage is true it just isnt compelling. This despite excellent work by ""Bourne Identity"" director Liman (who did his own cinematography) in his best ""All the Presidents Men"" mode and one of the finest performances of Watts career. Rather than concern for the private lives of those acted upon what we feel is outrage about the public act and no amount of good work can change that. kenneth.turanlatimes.com"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review The Campaign follows winning strategyAugust 9 2012New on DVDMarch 27 2011Fair Game star Naomi Watts really knows her character...October 24 2010At Hearing Its Plames Turn To TalkMarch 17 2007MOVIE REVIEW  Explosions Confusion the Bill of Fare in...November 3 1995"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt;MORE STORIES ABOUTFair GameCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-fair-game-20101105,0,7233172.story",200,fairgame(2010)16,fairgame(2010),latimes

In the thick of all the subterfuge its easy to lose track of who you really are what you really do.And it doesnt help when your boss back home - the country the corporation the agency that employs you - pulls the rug out from under you.Which is exactly what happens to Naomi Watts character in the taut shattering Fair Game. That the character happens to be Valerie Plame the real-life CIA operative exposed by higher-ups in the Bush administration - blowing her cover and endangering a network of contacts - only makes the story more powerful. And maddening.Directed by Doug Liman (who launched a pretty decent spy franchise with The Bourne Identity) from a tight script by Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth Fair Game focuses on the relationship between Plame and her husband former ambassador Joe Wilson (a quietly volatile Sean Penn). From the vantage of neighbors and friends Plame and Wilson are just a couple of busy successful Washingtonians. Two kids. Nice house. He consults. She works in energy analysis.Behind Valerie and Joes front door however its another matter. ""All weve been doing is leaving Post-Its for each other"" gripes the husband frustrated that Valeries frequent and mysterious trips overseas have left him without a wife and also without a clue. ""If you went missing"" he rages ""I could never tell anybody - because you werent there.""But theyve managed - until the months leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration was looking for proof of weapons of mass destruction. Plame returns from a trip with data that says there is no active nuclear program. Wilson dispatched to Niger to investigate rumors of the sale of enriched uranium reports that no such deal took place.And then Operation Iraqi Freedom begins based on ""information"" about aluminum tubes and enriched uranium that both Plame and Wilson had debunked. Hes mad and writes an op-ed piece in the New York Times decrying the war and the excuses used to launch it.And somewhere in the Bush-Cheney-Rove hierarchy the decision to expose Plame is made - an act of political vengeance. (Scooter Libby chief of staff to the vice president and also an assistant to the president on national security issues was indicted by a federal grand jury. Character actor David Andrews plays Libby and Adam LeFevre is an eerie look-alike Rove.)Its an epic betrayal and it throws Plames and Wilsons lives - not to mention livelihoods - into turmoil.Watts gives a deep and Oscar-worthy performance here displaying the steely composure that made Plame a valued NOC (non-official cover operative). With fierceness in her eyes but nuance in her moves the actress conveys the hurt anger and emotional confusion of a woman whose career has been torpedoed and whose marriage and family are falling apart before her eyes.While audiences may have had their fill of documentaries and narrative features dealing with the Iraq war Fair Game works as far more than just another Bush-era disaster story. Its a real-life spy drama. Its human drama. Its political drama. And its engrossing all around.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Fair Game takes one of the more shameful sub-chapters in modern US politics -- the Bush administrations outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame in retaliation for her ex-diplomat husband Joe Wilsons public comments on the Iraq War -- and turns it into a strident condescending Hollywood melodrama.Its one of those nobly intended affairs in which Important Stars explain to us how weve been screwed by our elected representatives. Naomi Watts doing interesting things with her teeth plays Plame a harried Washington-area working mom who secretly jets about the globe digging up intel on terrorists. Sean Penn is Joe Wilson whose profitable consulting business in international affairs cant disguise his frustration with being a DC househusband.Director Doug Liman works hard to show us the reality of Plames working life the deals she cuts with informants in Kuala Lumpur the way she cajoles Americanized Iraqis into spying on their families back home. Its not glamorous and its not meant to be. As the Bush White House gears up for war after 9/11 Plames CIA bosses are pressured for evidence of Iraqs weapons of mass destruction. This is illustrated by one of Dick Cheneys wonks talking about the ""nuculer threat an easy shot the filmmakers simply cant resist.As we now know neither the evidence nor the weapons existed. The first half of ""Fair Game plays out as an intriguing struggle between the CIAs smug pragmatism and the White Houses rampaging ideology. When Wilsons report on a Nigerian nonconnection is willfully distorted by the administration he lets fly in the pages of The New York Times. Cheneys man Scooter Libby (David Andrews) vows to ""change the story and soon Plames cover is blown in the Washington Post.At this point ""Fair Game falls apart because it cant decide whether to tell its story from the inside or the outside. The movies a partisan project and it has to be; what happened to the Plame-Wilsons was by any measure wrong. Yet in trying to humanize what for many moviegoers is a knotty news story ill-served by TV soundbites ""Fair Game dumbs down its message and performances to the level of a public-service soap opera.Without her job Wattss Plame turns into a disconsolate noodle while Penns Wilson leaps at the chance to matter once more appearing on any news show that will have him. The latter especially is an interesting development suggesting that Joes ego was as much on the line as his wifes career. Yet since complexity of character takes the film off-message ""Fair Game backs away from Wilsons self-aggrandizing side repositioning him as a hero for the home stretch. He was that and he was human but the movie cant settle on the proportions.You can feel ""Fair Game trying to squeeze its events into the confines of a narrative that well ""get and the effort feels high-handed to say the least. (Documentaries like Charles Fergusons ""No End in Sight do a better job with far less patronizing.) In case you were worried about thinking for yourself the movie ends with a thundering speech by Wilson about our own responsibilities as citizens and civic watchdogs. He delivers it to a classroom but hes really talking to us and you sense that Penn took the role for this scene alone. If the sentiments are on-target the approach is pure boilerplate soldered on to the story without finesse.

Share Tweet Ostensibly the story of Valerie Plame the CIA operative who wrote Fair Game How A Top CIA Agent Was Betrayed By Her Own Government Doug Limans fact-based drama Fair Game really belongs to Sean Penn who adds Plames husband Joseph Wilson to his gallery of unforgettable characters. Penn plays the floppy-haired veteran diplomat as a man whose strengths are inextricably connected to his faults. Hes a man of deep furious convictions unafraid to live by his ideals even at the cost of the comfort safety and happiness of his own family. Fair Game consequently registers at times like a cautionary tale about the downside of rigid uncompromising idealism. The intense drama stars Naomi Watts as Plame a hyper-efficient CIA operative who has mastered the art of lying professionally an essential skill for the successful undercover agent. But her thriving career becomes collateral damage in the amorphous War On Terror when her husband (Penn) writes an op-ed piece attacking the Bush administrations rationales for the Iraq War based on his experiences in Niger. ""Scooter"" Libby the vice presidents chief of staff leaks her identity to columnist Robert Novak in retribution. The leak destroys everything shes worked decades to achieve but the worst is yet to come. Instead of backing down Wilson and Plames enemies besmirch their names in the press smearing Plame as a third-rate agent and Wilson as a broke desperate politically motivated opportunist. Liman gives the action the you-are-there immediacy that distinguished his earlier tale of international intrigue The Bourne Identity. Documenting history as its still being written is inherently tricky but Liman and screenwriters Jez and John-Henry Butterworths assured grasp of the material recalls the clear-eyed verisimilitude of All The Presidents Men rather than the fuzzy overwrought mythologizing of W. Limans film is powered by a subtle but unmistakable sense of outrage Its ultimately a tale of heroism in the face of fearsome powerful opposition but as stubborn pride masquerading as ideological purity proves Wilsons Achilles heel the films heroes reveal themselves as flawed to an almost fatal extent and messily fascinatingly human.

"Secrets and lies and a suburban couple - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Secrets and lies and a suburban coupleFair Game a 3 starsNovember 04 2010|By Michael Phillips | Tribune movie criticDoug Liman made ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" the movie that brought together Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie over a pile of weapons. Now the same director who also made ""The Bourne Identity"" gives us a real-life only partly glamorized Mr. and Mrs. Smith a fact-based tale of Valerie Plame a non-official covert operative (NOC) in the employ of the Central Intelligence Agency and her diplomat husband Joseph Wilson. One personality fed on secrecy the other bravado and public outrage. ""Fair Game"" takes us back to a place many of us are reluctant to revisit in the name of a good time the Bush White House in the years 2002 and 2003 as the excuses for invading Iraq got more craven and deceptive by the second. Naomi Watts portrays Plame whom we first see working undercover in Kuala Lumpur. (Working as his own cinematographer Liman shot ""Fair Game"" in Egypt Jordan Malaysia and Iraq in addition to Washington D.C. and New York.) She comes and goes while her husband played by Sean Penn wonders where shes coming and going. ""Weve been leaving Post-its for each other for months now....if you go missing I cant tell anyone because you were never there."" In their suburban D.C. kitchen Wilsons plea is answered with a simple ""Im going to Cleveland."" They know its a lie that must be retold. This is the most interesting material in the film the everyday domestic weirdnesses in and among kids and lunches and schedules of a spy and her husband a former U.S. ambassador. The CIA sent Wilson to Niger to determine whether Saddam Hussein had attempted to buy uranium yellowcake for his weapons program. Wilson came back with a ""no."" The Bush team wanted a ""yes."" One thing led to another. Wilson wrote an op-ed piece in The New York Times taking issue with how his intelligence was ignored. Vice President Dick Cheneys office eventually leaked Plames identity to columnist Robert Novak in an attempt to frame Wilson as a freeloading unreliable spouse. Once Plames name was in print and online her career was over. But she fought back and while ""Fair Game"" has a few lines you wish it didnt (""Theyre not going to take my marriage"") its an absorbing thriller honoring its subjects without making them saints. Watts conveys intelligence and a steely core; Penns Wilson rough around the edges and a bit of a blowhard has a particularly well-written scene (the script is by British brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth) in which he reminds Valerie that the loudest voice in the room isnt the smartest or the bravest its simply the loudest. Limans sensibility isnt sophisticated enough to tease out the nuances of what must be a pretty interesting marriage; the movie is more about texture and surfaces and surface tensions. But it moves. Do audiences want to revisit this time these stories this account of character smears and political sleaze? Well see. But if they do see it theyll get a pretty good movie out of it. ""Fair Game"" struck me as minor in its Cannes Film Festival premiere earlier this year. A few months later outside the festival context it seems not quite major but not quite minor. And its about something that matters. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for some language) Cast Naomi Watts (Valerie Plame); Sean Penn (Joseph Wilson); Sam Shepard (Sam Plame); Ty Burrell (Fred); David Andrews ( Scooter Libby); Brooke Smith (Diana); Noah Emmerich (Bill); Bruce McGill (Jim Pavitt); Adam LeFevre ( Karl Rove) Credits Directed by Doug Liman; written by Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth based on the books ""The Politics of Truth"" by Joseph Wilson and ""Fair Game"" by Valerie Plame Wilson; produced by Bill Pohlad Janet Zucker Jerry Zucker Akiva Goldsman Jez Butterworth and Doug Liman.

Directed with born-again three-dimensional finesse by Doug Liman (Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith) the movie scrupulously retraces the events of the Plame affair in a way that probably wont influence anyones political views of it one iota. Yet Fair Game as it evolves from a spy-game mystery into an inside-the-Beltway Scenes From a Marriage enriches our human understanding of what the politics meant. Sean Penn all self-righteous middle-aged bluster is Plames diplomat husband Joe Wilson a charismatic dinner-party blowhard who in the run-up to the Iraq war goes on a fact-finding mission to Niger. He learns that the country never sold yellowcake uranium to Iraq and he then watches as the president misrepresents that finding in a speech to the nation. Wilson decides to go public with his outrage which is when the Bush men leak Plames identity -- as payback though really to change the story. Fair Game gets you riled up all over again at a deeply unpatriotic abuse of power. Yet as the Plame-Wilson marriage begins to fray and tear the two are really wrestling with a question that now haunts America Whats greater the price of hiding the truth -- or telling it?

Wilsons memoirs the unsurprisingly validating Fair Game begins as a timeline-hopping international thriller of the countdown months to the Iraq War. Covert CIA operative Plame (Naomi Watts) and ex-ambassador husband Wilson (Sean Penn) are proverbial ships passing in the night shuttling from Niger to Amman to Cleveland on fact-finding missions concerning Saddam Husseins nuclear program or lack thereof--until Plames cover is blown in The Washington Post as apparent retaliation for Wilsons administration-critical New York Times op-ed. Retelling headline news in human fine print Doug Liman makes a show of peeling back the layers of noise cutting from televised shock-and-awe to ground-level impact in Baghdad from cable-news talking heads accusing nepotism to domestic tension in the Plame-Wilson household and finally from Watts to the real Plame. Realism means an underlit beige-and-gray palette swinging handheld for firefight and dinner party alike and plenty of kitchen-sink business with the Wilsons rugrat twins always underfoot in domestic scenes. Penns lachrymosity and hotheaded indignity seem cartooned against Wattss contained conviction--though more incongruous couples have certainly existed--but the films assertion of Plame and Wilson as real people rather than characters consists mostly of draining them of anything compelling so that David Andrewss Scooter Libby commands the single best scene.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Devil You Dont Know In both Fair Game and Client 9 we watch shadowy figures practice the art of the public takedown. By David Edelstein Published Oct 31 2010 ShareThis (Photo Ken Regan/Courtesy of Summit Entertainment) Its easy to resent Doug Limans Valerie Plame docudrama Fair Game and Alex Gibneys shattering documentary Client 9 The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer for making it hard to put the past decades horrors behind us. Zach Galifianakiss beating off to get to sleep while prissy travel-mate Robert Downey Jr. cringes in Due Date is more fun. Even James Francos cutting off his arm to get loose from a boulder in 127 Hours is more fun The act is presented as a garish spectacle a test of our endurance akin to his real-life characters and when its over hes free on his way to being immortalized by the memoir hell write and the flashy Danny Boyle flick starring James Franco. Due Date and 127 Hours are slick fully rounded masochistic fantasies cathartic and self-contained whereas Liman and Gibney remind us that the bad guys are still out there They either got away or had the stakes pulled from their hearts by disciples like Dracula in the old Hammer films. Along with Charles Fergusons enraging Wall Street doc Inside Job and the flood of WikiLeaks material they make it impossible unless were delusional or on drugs to think that anything has changed. Fair Game based on separate memoirs by Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame Wilson is a martyr story in which a skilled professional couple gets the shiv after one of them turns whistle-blower. Its agenda is to show (a) that Wilson was correct in his assessment that yellowcake uranium was not transported from Niger to Iraq and that his decision to say so publicly (in a New York Times op-ed) after the war was under way was an act of remarkable courage; and (b) Plame was an effective covert CIA agent whose work was compromised and contacts imperiled by political operatives covering their lies. Exposed abandoned branded as traitors the Wilsons finally have no choice but to tell their story the latest chapter of which is this potent Hollywood melodrama starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts. Liman works in high-efficiency mode taking his tone from Plames no-nonsense competencewhich has the effect of making her husband the brooder the man of feeling the one who stays at home with the kids while she goes on secret missions look weaker more conventionally feminine. Thats what gives Fair Game its subtext and drama (as opposed to melodrama) Will Plame forgive him for losing his shit and publishing that op-ed (without according to the movie discussing it with her in advance) thereby ending her career and threatening their family life? Its touch and go and Watts does something subtle in her final scenes She tells her repentant husband that he did the right thing he saved her yet her body doesnt entirely go along. In any case he didnt slay the dragon. Scooter Libby (uncannily impersonated by David Andrews) took the fall but only for perjury (sentence commuted) and everyone else in the V.P.s office not to mention Karl Rove got off. The war went on. Every detail in Fair Gamethe title comes from Rove who allegedly told Chris Matthews Wilsons wife is fair gamesuggests the administrations scandalous indifference to real threats as for example when Plame was pulled off the Pakistan beat (where there was plenty of evidence of Al Qaeda collusion) and forced to work on Iraq (where there was nada). Libbys interrogation of Wilson is a concise dramatization of what Ron Suskind called the One Percent Doctrine If theres a one percent chance there are nukes In a largely humorless film there are two amusing touches. The fictionalized CIA men craven Jack (Michael Kelly) and Cheney tool Bill (Noah Emmerich) have their surnames blacked out in the cast listan allusion to Plames heavily redacted memoir. And proponents of the yellowcake threat say like their president nucular which for me is a Pavlovian zap nuculararghhnuculararghh. Its worse than the Knights Who Say Ni In Client 9 Gibney has shaped a similar narrative of a maverick taken down by powerful enemies. Mind you he cant make that his stated thesis. Given the strong but circumstantial evidence Gibney has no choice but to extrapolate and hypothesize especially considering that his subject Spitzer blames only himself invoking such Greek concepts as hubris. Its probably easier for an ex-prosecutor known for macho threats to say he got caught screwing than for him to say he got screwed. But folks he was reamed. For all the juicy evocative details of high-priced-call-girl emporia Gibneys story is rooted in Spitzers Wall Street crusades when he made his name (and enemies) by going hard after the kind of people whod eventually bring the country to the brink of bankruptcy and doing it despite SEC indifference (or collusion). Along the way he went mano-a-mano with two of the biggest dogs former NYSE director Ken Langone and AIG CEO Maurice Hank Greenberg the former for giving Dick Grasso a nearly 150 million retirement package the latter for allegedly cooking the books. It was Bush Justice Department lawyer Michael Garcia who ordered Spitzer to drop the case against Greenberg the same Garcia who would later pursue Governor Spitzer for violating the Mann Act (prohibiting the transport of sex slaves across state lines) on a tip from that proudly Nixonian GOP hit man Roger Stone. 1 2 Next Share this story...

TWITTER In ""Fair Game"" Doug Liman mostly avoids delivering a political treatise. Instead he strips the Valerie Plame affair down to its essential elements the bare facts of the case the uneasy mix of the public and private lives of a D.C.-area family where Mom is a spy and the life-changing upheaval -- including a marital rift -- caused when her identity is blown for political purposes. This allows a viewer to better understand these two people who were so much the center of attention in the U.S. seven years ago. Whether moviegoers even today can look at this real-life couple extremely well-played by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn without the distortion of political beliefs is uncertain. Nonetheless Liman and his collaborators strive to locate the human element amid the clutter of spin hypocrisy and partisan rhetoric. One can count on more op-ed pieces and political controversy when Summit releases the picture in the fall. How that impacts boxoffice is anybodys guess but the film certainly doesnt lack for name recognition. Liman outfits the film with spy-thriller packaging worthy of his The Bourne Identity so the film probably will attract above-average coin and possibly awards attention. As is almost too well-known in July 2003 the George W. Bush White House leaked Plames identity as a covert CIA agent and deliberately distorted the facts surrounding a mission to Niger by her husband former Ambassador Joseph Wilson. The goal was to discredit a New York Times op-ed piece Wilson wrote charging that the administration had manipulated intelligence data to make the case for the invasion of Iraq. This disclosure ended Plames career at the agency and according to the movie jeopardized the lives of many of her ""assets"" -- human beings overseas with whom Plame had contact. So the films story -- written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth based on books written by both husband and wife -- neatly divides into two parts an abrupt partition caused by the Robert Novak column that blew her cover. The first part spurred on by John Powells pulsating score centers on familys life as an uneasy masquerade. Even as Valerie (Watts) travels to the Middle and Far East the couples closest friends dont know her true vocation. So dinner-party arguments over Bush-era politics find the couple gazing at each other with Valerie never knowing when Joe (Penn) a hot-head when he hears misstatements of facts will explode at someone. This in itself is an intriguing story How does one raise a family and create a false appearance to maintain a parents cover? In other words this is the real version of James Camerons tongue-in-cheek action comedy True Lies. Then comes Novaks column. The media besieges the couples home threats rain down on them and their children and the marriage starts to crack. Her career is kaput and his business dries up as the White House and some media outlets increase the drumbeat of disinformation. Joe goes on the offensive appearing on talk shows and university campuses to deliver his side of the story but Valerie a trained CIA career officer remains silent. Each reacts with completely different instincts but hers threatens to undermine his defense of the truth about their lives. The movie pinpoints the turning point as Valeries visit to her parents. Sam Shepard playing her retired Air Force officer dad straightens her out about how loyalty to ones country is a two-lane street. Its overly simplistic of course but works well enough in dramatic terms. The film crams a lot of material into its 106 minutes. Even so it takes short cuts. High-powered White House operatives are caricatured and Wilsons crucial trip to Niger is understandably truncated. Events taking place over months and even years get telescoped into days. But Liman does succeed in maintaining a steady focus on his protagonists. Their pain as the marriage cracks is palpable and the film vividly captures the distinct differences in their natures. Liman who acts as his own cinematographer situates his drama in a world in constant flux. Even before their crisis both parents are constantly on the go. But within these fast-paced lives each must maintain a facade that is essential to Valeries work. So there is going to be strain even without any leak. Fair Game might be one of the best spy movies ever even if it contains little skullduggery. Like a John le Carre novel its story shows how things really work and how compromised lives can become when one must serve more than one master.

Following ""Green Zone"" as another slightly dated attack on the Bush administrations mishandling of Iraq ""Fair Game"" serves up impeccable politics with a bit too much righteous outrage and not quite enough solid drama. Doug Limans film does a respectably intelligent job of spinning the Valerie Plame affair into a sleek mainstream entertainment that means to rouse ones patriotic ire and at times stirringly succeeds. But the overall conception feels too streamlined to maximize the impact of leads Naomi Watts and Sean Penn spelling an uncertain fall B.O. reception by a public thats proven none too game for topical fare. ""Fair Game"" was adapted by brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth from books written by the sagas two central figures former CIA operative Plame and her husband retired ambassador Joe Wilson. Pitched at the intersection of international and domestic affairs its the story of a D.C. marriage thrust into the spotlight when in 2003 high-placed White House officials leaked Plames covert status to the media -- a spiteful act of betrayal intended to discredit Wilson and his dissenting opinion on the presence of WMD in Iraq. A low-key spy-thriller opening set in 2001 Kuala Lumpur -- presumably fictitious though its hard to tell from Plames heavily redacted memoir -- introduces Valerie (Watts) as a skilled CIA operative who when not running missions overseas has a busy but happy home life with older husband Joe (Penn) and their twin children. With President Bush making the case for war from every TV screen the CIA is working overtime to confirm the existence of Saddam Husseins nuclear (pronounced ""nucular"" by one overzealous agent echoing a real-life Bushism) program -- something Joe an outspoken Democrat regards with the utmost skepticism. When the agency hears that Iraq may be buying yellowcake uranium from Niger Joe an expert on the Western African nation is sent to investigate. He concludes theres no basis to the assertion -- not that it matters to the White House which deliberately misconstrues his report as one more pretext for war. Furious Joe pens a New York Times op-ed piece pointing out Bushs misstatement of the facts. Eight days later the Times publishes a devastating rebuttal in the form of Robert Novaks column which blows Valeries cover and effectively ends her career -- a leak the film traces back to Vice President Cheneys chief of staff Scooter Libby (a poisonous spot-on comic turn by David Andrews). Valeries blown cover has major repercussions for an Iraqi source who soon finds himself in the path of Bushs shock-and-awe campaign a subplot that feels both apocryphal and manipulative. From there pic becomes a simmering portrait of a marriage under intense strain not only from the outside world -- as the media charge the Wilsons with nepotism and treachery -- but also from within Valerie her professional and personal life in ruins wants to move on but Joe refuses to let the matter rest and lashes back via the TV news circuit (Andrea Mitchell Chris Matthews and Fox News are among those referenced). Necessarily condensed for the screen the marital drama as presented is clear effective and emotionally precise; even before disaster strikes Watts and Penn (in their third screen pairing after ""21 Grams"" and ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"") realize some strong moving moments as a couple trying to balance family and career obligations. But at 105 minutes ""Fair Game"" is almost too smooth and clean-burning an engine short-changing key details and relegating juicy incidents (such as a Vanity Fair photo shoot) to mere exposition. One can admire Limans economy as well as his return to form after the lamentable ""Jumper"" but all the elements seem in place for a longer denser and even more excoriating expose of political corruption at the expense of middle-class Americans. (Such a film would certainly have made a bigger target of Karl Rove who was eventually identified as a source of the leak but unlike Libby never prosecuted.) Watts has no trouble conveying Valeries supreme competence something the agents peers are often quick to underestimate based on her looks but the material doesnt allow her to convey the full magnitude of her characters devastation at what shes lost. Penn his brow so lined that even his furrows have furrows is almost cast too much in line with his offscreen persona and there are a handful of sanctimonious moments here -- particularly in the final stretch in which the film becomes a straight-up lecture on civic duty -- when one senses not Wilson but Penn wagging his finger at the audience. For the first time since ""Go"" Liman has opted to handle lensing duties himself and the result has a slightly chilly washed-out look visually evoking the gray zone between private truths and public lies. Tech credits are pro all the way with impressive but unobtrusive location shooting in Jordan Egypt and Malaysia. John Powells music supports the action with an admirable lack of bombast.
