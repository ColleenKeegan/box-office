Starring Barry McEvoy Brian F. OByrne Anna Friel Billy Connolly. Directed by Barry Levinson. (R. 109 minutes. At the Metro.) A sneeze would blow it away but the new Irish comedy ""An Everlasting Piece"" has enough eccentricity and sense of fun to make it worth a visit to the classy Metro theater on Union Street where it opens exclusively today. Dont plan on much in the way of leftovers though. The odd charms of this film directed by Barry Levinson but a far cry from his amusingly shaped and cogently detailed slices of American life are likely to evaporate for most viewers the minute the credits roll. Yet this is a funny novelty no denying it. The story of two Irishmen from opposite sides of the political and religious divide in Belfast is a smart interweaving of comedy and tragic realities of the Northern Ireland conflict which plagues even the most mundane aspects of everyday life. The films theme is that regardless of which side theyre on bald men share the common desire of wanting to improve their sex appeal with hair. Barry McEvoy starring as the Roman Catholic Colm also wrote the screenplay his first effort. On the Protestant side is George (Brian F. OByrne). Both men meet as barbers at a Belfast hospital where they clip the psychiatric ward patients. One patient is a scary dude named the Scalper (Billy Connolly ""Mrs. Brown"") his moniker is derived from his occupation as the only mens wig salesman in the Belfast area. With the Scalper put away Colm and George take over his business hoping to ditch their dead-end often perilous hospital barber gigs. Played out in loosely connected set pieces ""An Everlasting Piece"" follows the boys as they make a first sale to a Protestant reputed to have killed an IRA man. Among several repeated jokes in the film is the way the word hairpiece is pronounced in Irish dialect to make it sound like ""herpes."" The grumpy Protestant customer cheats Colm and George out of their fee. In a gritty action sequence Colm steals back the rug and is chased by the extremely angry fellow and his working-class cronies who would love nothing better than to throttle a Catholic in their Protestant neighborhood. Eventually of course the pair have dealings with the IRA itself a nervous business with complications but Colm and George are desperate for sales. All the while a rival pair of wig salesmen calling their enterprise Toupee or Not Toupee is creating stiff competition. A British wigmaker says it is willing to hire the duo with the best sales record to become an exclusive distributor. McEvoys Colm is the treat of this film. Hes got swagger and an appealing vulnerability. The scene where hes accosted by snapping dogs who steal one of his hairpiece samples is a tickle. Anna Friel (""A Midsummer Nights Dream"") plays Colms feisty girlfriend. The notion that male vanity reduces the Troubles to an absurdity is never fully realized in the story. But its the optimism that counts. Advisory Contains raw language some nudity.

OByrne and Laurence Kinlan in ""An Everlasting Piece."" (Brian Hamill/DreamWorks) Barry Levinson has it down when it comes to improvisational banter among working-class characters. If you havent seen any of his Baltimore-based films you owe it to yourself to catch ""Diner"" ""Tin Men"" and ""Liberty Heights."" The Levinson touch gets a thick Irish accent in ""An Everlasting Piece"" a comedy set in Belfast during the turbulent 1980s. Written by Barry McEvoy who also co-stars the movie finds charming humor in a world full of sectarian strife between Protestant and Catholic. And this may be the first movie to portray IRA activists as lovable goofballs who are desperate for a little more hair on the top. Colm (McEvoy) is a Catholic. George (Brian F. OByrne) is a Protestant. Both are great pals and fellow barbers. Theyre not exactly making money. So when they hear that the deranged owner (Billy Connolly) of a toupee company has been jailed (for impulsively scalping people) they figure they can assume his corner of the market. After persuading the imprisoned scalper to cough up his client list they start their new business (""The Piece People"") full of hope. But their dream is stalled by news of another company called Toupee or not Toupee. If Colm and George want an exclusive franchise from their English suppliers (Wigs of Wimbledon) theyre going to have to sell more pieces than their rivals. They have until midnight on Christmas Eve. This being Northern Ireland their mission is rife with political problems. Their Catholic clients arent thrilled to buy from a partnership that includes a Protestant; and their Protestant customers are similarly resistant to the Catholic in the mix. Colm and George are forced to lie about their faiths according to the situation. And then theres the product itself. The hairpieces come from real Dutch Protestant hair they tell the Protestants. And they assure their Catholic buyers these pieces were cut from the heads of Catholic nuns. Matters come to a head so to speak when an IRA leader gives them a large order which would put them over the top in the sales competition. George (a proud Protestant) and Colms girlfriend Bronagh (Anna Friel) both think it would be immoral to sell to a partisan political organization. But Colm prefers to focus on the money they stand to make out of the deal. Although the movie buys somewhat into the long-held premise that the Irish are lovable cartoon characters ""An Everlasting Piece"" has an authentic undertone. (McEvoy based much of his screenplay on war stories from his father a real Irish barber who now cuts hair in Washington.) While Colm and George ply their fledgling trade IRA soldiers and English troops in riot gear menacingly roam the town. And the graffiti-splashed walls squalor and shots of unemployed men attest to Belfasts gritty realities. This intense backdrop gets welcome relief when a man in a ski mask stops the barbers in the middle of nowhere demanding to know what theyre doing in his territory. As soon as he learns about their toupees he doffs his mask and tries on a sample. A united Ireland is one thing. But a good affordable hairpiece? Now theres a reachable goal. ""An Everlasting Piece"" (R 109 minutes) - Contains obscenity profanity and a drunk nude lad on a settee.

A diversionary little knockoff for director Barry Levinson amid his usual alternating pattern of big-star vehicles and more personal Baltimore projects this gently eccentric yarn about a Catholic and Protestant team of hairpiece salesmen in 80s Belfast would no doubt have been embraced on the specialty circuit worldwide had it been an indigenous British or Irish low-budgeter; as a Yank-financed major studio production that can only be sold on the directors name its hard to see how this modest venture wont get lost in the commercial shuffle. The whimsical yet politically tinged double entendre of the title ""An Everlasting Piece"" serves as a precise reflection of the nature and extent of the humor in this good-natured exceedingly wispy film. A diversionary little knockoff for director Barry Levinson amid his usual alternating pattern of big-star vehicles and more personal Baltimore projects this gently eccentric yarn about a Catholic and Protestant team of hairpiece salesmen in 80s Belfast would no doubt have been embraced on the specialty circuit worldwide had it been an indigenous British or Irish low-budgeter; as a Yank-financed major studio production that can only be sold on the directors name its hard to see how this modest venture wont get lost in the commercial shuffle. News of Levinson taking on such a non-Hollywood project -- one that emanated from New York pub readings of the script -- stirred a bit of attention at the time and at its heart there is something quite appealing about the way actor and first-time screenwriter Barry McEvoy makes light of the long-standing religious/political conflict in Northern Ireland by filtering it through faintly absurdist shenanigans. At the same time the humor is mostly on the level of clever wordplay small jokes and glancing ironies attributes that generally provoke smiles rather than outright laughs. Its a film of myriad minor pleasures but scant compelling qualities. Premise throws together the Catholic Colm (McEvoy) and Protestant George (Brian F. OByrne) as barbers at a Belfast hospital. Quickly getting past their religion-based mutual suspicions through their shared love of verse the young men hatch a business scheme when they find that the only mens hairpiece provider in Northern Ireland is a ferocious fellow named Scalper (Billy Connolly) whos now in for an extended stay at their facility. Stepping into the void the young men procure a hairpiece (one of the films repeated gags hinges upon how this words Irish pronunciation makes people think the men are offering them herpes) and sell it on partial credit to a disagreeable gent who subsequently refuses to pay the balance. This leads to the pictures big action set piece a chase triggered when Colm snatches the rug off the mans dome. More trouble surfaces when another duo who call themselves Toupee or Not Toupee start horning in on the action. As the holidays approach a big English concern Wigs of Wimbledon announces that whichever team sells the most hairpieces by Christmas Eve will become its exclusive distributor for all of Northern Ireland. Lagging in sales with the deadline looming the Belfast boys struggle to single out a large group of bald people for a big sale a matter in which Colms feisty and foxy girlfriend Bronagh (Anna Friel) proves very helpful. While theres just enough plot to keep the narrative wheels turning McEvoy who got a lot of the material here from his Belfast barber/wig salesman father devotes most of his writerly attention to inflating anecdotes and small incidents as far as they will bear. A prime example is a long sequence in which Colm and George become hopelessly lost in the countryside one night and are accosted by hooded IRA terrorists who put them through the wringer at gunpoint until the lads turn the confrontation into a sales opportunity. Then there are dozens of nice smaller touches the incongruous positioning of Colms isolated family home up against a wall overlooking the Protestant quarter the old vicar who must be convinced a wig is made of Catholic hair before he buys it and some menacing goons who force Colm and Bronagh to stay for the playing of ""God Save the Queen"" at the end of the evening in a cinema. Such bits are amusing insightful and ironic by turn but are hardly the stuff of significant comedy or drama. McEvoy who appeared on Broadway in the musical ""On the Waterfront"" and ""The Sisters Rosensweig"" and OByrne who was Tony-nominated for both ""The Beauty Queen of Leenane"" and ""The Lonesome West"" interact well with the former embodying a certain brash glibness and the latter conveying a more sensitive contemplative nature. Friel who looks smashing in a tartan miniskirt and black tights adds zip to all her scenes while supporting players are uniformly responsive to the deadpan drollery of the material. Despite the Hollywood pedigree pic is not overproduced in any overt way having employed local talent in all positions except for production designer editor and composer. Wintry setting adds a vivid chilly dimension to the already bleak Belfast location which represents a strong character of its own.
