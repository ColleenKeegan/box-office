Comments (1) click to enlarge Sucker Punch Video Rated PG-13  109 minutes  2011 Gun-toting hotties combat assorted villains and their robot henchmen in this tawdry repellent action fantasy. The heroine is a nubile saucer-eyed waif (Emily Browning) whose mother dies and whose stepfather coveting the girls inheritance sends her to a mental asylum that morphs into a brothel. Unwilling to live as a sex slave she transforms into an an anime-style warrior princess and leads a crew of her scantily clad fellow inmates on a series of violent quests jumping noisily from one alternative reality to another. Oscar Isaac plays the seedy caretaker/procurer with relish but the real pimp here is writer-director Zack Snyder (300 Watchmen). With Carla Gugino Abbie Cornish Jena Malone and Scott Glenn.

The slow-motion auteurs first film not based on a pre-existing property still feels mighty reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland The Matrix Moulin Rouge One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Cinderella and The Lord of the Rings all mashed together in one faux-profound quasi-feminist blowout. When Mom dies Babydoll (Emily Browning) is all that stands between her little sister and their wicked stepfather. However one errant ricochet takes the siblings life and gives the stepfather cause enough to throw Babydoll into the nearest insane asylum and once subjected to the nefarious deeds of the orderlies (led by Oscar Isaac) she reimagines the entire nuthouse as a burlesque front for a bustling brothel. Babydolls eager to escape though and can dance well enough to keep all mens eyes on her so with the help of Rocket (Jena Malone) Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) she then re-reimagines her tasks at hand to take on the form of epic fantasy battles against giant gun-wielding samurai dragons robots orcs and steampunk zombie soldiers. Thats right goofy fantasy within grimy fantasy atop a grim reality. Snyder likes to think that his Russian nesting doll of a concept is enough to excuse its hollow center. Its hard to believe that the female leads are being empowered when theyre forced to wear skimpy outfits for their sleazy superiors and clients not when they are only ever portrayed as being in charge within dream sequences that carry all the weight of video-game cut scenes and have all the depth of righteous van art. Characters jump and twirl when it would simply be easier to duck from incoming gunfire and swinging swords because it looks cooler that way and the camera pulls off dizzying roundabout maneuvers that are intended to impress but instead reinforce the numbing digital slickness of it all. And if the performances arent terribly compelling (especially in the cases of Ms. Chung and Ms. Hudgens) thats OK because its all imagined anyhow. There are anachronisms galore as relics from World Wars I and II and Vietnam crop up alongside mechanized battle suits and levitating space trains because why the hell not. With a little Freudian symbolism sprinkled throughout (the penetration of sex is associated with that of surgical procedures) what appears to be two hours of wet dreams is supposedly bolstered by underpinnings of rape abuse and death. Its a very serious attempt to justify some very silly stuff. Snyder and co-writer Steve Shibuya try to convince us that feminine charms are a weapon in and of themselves while at the same day embracing the live-action anime ideal that nothing could be sexier than a schoolgirl with a sword. They even get Sweet Pea to spit out a wink-wink speech to that effect ""Dont you get the point of this? Its to turn people on. I get the sexy little schoolgirl. I even get the helpless mental patient right? That can be hot. But what is this? Lobotomized vegetable? How about something a little more commercial for Gods sakes?"" The rest of the film is ultimately all of the above and -- as already proven -- distinctly uncommercial. Sucker Punch starts out with a cover of ""Sweet Dreams Are Made of This"" as crooned by Ms. Browning herself but Id argue that theyre really not. The Blu-ray transfer flatters the lavish production design though a healthy amount of included grain seems to soften the digital effects and help offset the fakery of it all. (I could be wrong but the grain may very well intentionally lessen as Babydoll retreats from scummy halls to pristine landscapes.) An extended cut of the film has been included on its own separate Blu-ray disc running 17 minutes longer than the theatrical cut. The changes are mostly accounted for by an Act I musical sequence an Act II orc battle and an Act III scene between Browning and Jon Hamm that single-handedly fleshes out his role from a fleeting cameo into a more substantial supporting turn. Aside from an extra gunshot here and an added line its hard to see why this cut merited an R rating over a PG-13. The extended cut disc includes a ""Maximum Movie Mode"" during which Snyder discusses the shoot and the changes between the two versions while still galleries cast interviews and synchronized storyboards pop up throughout. Its a nice and thorough approach to the commentary track but the featured content would ideally also be accessible through its own menu. The theatrical cut disc includes four animated shorts running 11 minutes in total that flesh out the mythos behind each fantasy realm; like the scenes in each realm these are cool but ultimately pointless given the films narrative admission that these enemies are already complete inventions. There is also a brief plug for the Sucker Punch soundtrack.

In fact it comes across as the sad wet dream of a middle-aged man raised on the reductive archetypes of comic-books and computer games.Committed to a 1950s mental asylum by her step-father Babydoll (Emily Browning) escapes from the grim reality of past abuse cruel male guards and theatre-based therapy by conjuring up worlds in which she and fellow inmates fight giant samurais steam-powered World War I zombies flame-breathing dragons or robots. But Babydoll could be just a fantasy of Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) whose survival strategy is to create a liberating movie-inflected version of her relationships with her kid sister Rocket (Jena Malone) and fellow inmates Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). In these alternate worlds the Wise Man (Scot Glenn) offers the incarcerated girls freedom through violence - or more precisely male fantasies in which they strip down to their underwear and literally battle with their demons.As in 300 and Watchmen Snyder pulverises our senses with derivative digital images and obvious musical choices. But his failure to delineate the levels of reality is confusing and self-defeating. Carla Gugino vamps it up as the Polish-accented drama therapist/brothel madam Oscar Isaac is convincing as the asylum guard/pimp and the female actors are left to emoting and fighting in their pants.

It dared to be original but has turned out to be the HUDSON HAWK of its day. Hopefully this will be the end of CGI-heavy films...

Yes its a very dark film about a very dark subject but its so not about ""titillation"" its about taking back control as much as possible (in whichever form - reality or dream) and making a difference. No threat? Of course there wasnt - thats the point of dreams Did you expect a happy ending? Take a look at the news - life doesnt always have happy endings. I think this is going to be one of those films you have to watch a number of times to fully appreciate it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 2 2011IanFeaturedWords can not truly describe how awful this movie is. The only people I can see enjoying this film would be single lonely men in slow motion and freeze frame on their own on a dvd. In years to come Abbie Cornish and Emily Browning will look back on this with embarassment. The first question to ask is why did do many well known actresses and actors sign up for this rubbish? Things must be very slow for Vanessa Hudgens after High Street Musical because that can be the only reason she signed up for a role that consists of little more than teenage male titilation in a corset and stockings. The gratuitous down the cleavage shots will be appreciated by the films target audience but few others.

"Sucker Punch | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sucker-punch ) Sucker Punch (United States/Canada 2011) March 26 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli ""It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing."" When Shakespeare penned those words for Act V Scene V of MacBeth he might have emerged from a screening of Sucker Punch. This movie isnt bad in the way some incompetently made movies are bad; this is bad because theres much skill evident in a pointless endeavor. Rarely has more technical wizardry and cinematic artistry been wasted. If visuals once served the story but now its the other way around Sucker Punch illustrates this taken to an extreme. There really is no narrative here and there certainly are no characters. The film is an excuse for directorial excess. Its an exercise in public masturbation for Zack Snyder who doesnt even have the decency to strive for the R-rating that would at least allow for the exploitative gratuitous sex nudity and violence that Sucker Punch desperately needs. Wheres the giant blue penis when we need it? There is promise in the opening - a nightmarish tableau set in a gothic world of desaturated color. A triple tragedy befalls the young woman who will become known only as Baby Doll (Emily Browning) her mother dies her sister is murdered by her guardian and Baby Doll accused of the murder is consigned to an asylum. There she faces a grim future with the possibility of a lobotomy in five days - unless she can escape. At this point the movie shifts into a souped-up Technicolor representation of Baby Dolls situation. This is how her mind copes with being in the asylum. No longer a prisoner in a madhouse she is a dancer in a brothel/club where runaways are held captive and forced to perform for wealthy clients. Baby Doll plans her escape with the aid of four other dancer-prostitutes Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) Rocket (Jena Malone) Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). They are lorded over by club owner Blue (Oscar Isaac) and his choreographer Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino) while awaiting for the arrival of the High Roller (Jon Hamm) who is actually the lobotomist. There is a third layer of fantasy to all of this. In order to escape Baby Doll generates a list of four items that must be acquired. As each of these tasks is performed we are catapulted into bizarre video game-inspired scenarios in which a goal must be achieved. In one such episode Baby Doll duels three giant mechanical beings. Another contains World War II flavors. A third s inspired by Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings with orcs and dragons. A fourth involves a speeding train with a bomb on board destined for a city. All are represented using stunning CGI imagery; as pieces of pop visual art they are arresting but their eye-popping qualities serve not to obfuscate the paucity of the material but to emphasize it. The characters arent merely poorly developed; they are undeveloped. They are cartoons garbed in fetishistic attire whose exploits are dull. The action despite being posed as fast and furious is devoid of purpose. Theres no sense of suspense. Even when one of the heroines is in danger theres no emotional response. We dont care about these people. Not only are they not real but theyre buried two levels deep in fantasy and nightmares. Its as if Snyder saw Inception while drunk or high and immediately sat down to write Sucker Punch. As if all that wasnt bad enough the ending is fundamentally unsatisfying. The actions of the prologue - the only segment of Sucker Punch in which we care about whats happening and the wrongs being done to an individual - are left unresolved. The chief miscreant goes unpunished. The movie ends on a flat note shifting its focus to a secondary character as if the conclusion to her story has meaning. It doesnt. The actresses were apparently chosen more for their physical attributes than for their thespian talents or box office appeal. They do what they were paid to do look hot show some degree of athleticism (heavily enhanced by CGI) and be able to deliver minimal dialogue without stumbling over their lines. One assumes most of their work was done in front of blue/green screens since theres probably not one unenhanced background in the entire film. The actresses are continually upstaged by Snyders visual orgy but thats by intention. Theyre no more important to this kaleidoscope than the biplane whirling in the sky. The aesthetic evidenced here is much the same as the one employed by Snyder in 300 but theres a vast gulf in the quality of the source material. 300 unlike the quote used to begin this review isnt Shakespeare but its solidly entertaining. Theres enough substance to make Snyders vision an enhancement not a detriment. Thats not the case here. The loud pulsing hard rock score is more often grating than energizing; it calls attention to itself too forcefully contesting with the visuals for what can be more disruptive. I walked out of this movie in a state of depression. Depressed that so much technical bravura could be thrown away. Depressed that someone mistook this empty nihilistic sketch for a substantive and meaningful project. Depressed that I had been bamboozled into paying 10 to be subjected to it. At least however I understood the meaning of the title. I had been sucker punched.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 25 2011 625PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA A series of extravagant computer-generated adventure scenarios linked by grim mental hospital plot Sucker Punch represents a particularly ambitious exercise in tedium. The movie was created by Zack Snyder the creator of the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead as well as 300 and Watchmen. This is his first time working from original material if by ""original"" you mean a mash-up of every gothic robot war epic girls-in-chains cliche you can imagine. Most of this seems to take place in the head of our heroine a 20-year-old peroxide blonde known as Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who we first meet in long scenes of wordless slow-motion in which she gets taken by her psychopathic step-father to a hospital for ""the mentally insane."" The time is the early sixties; the place is in Vermont a Victorian hell hole where all the girls are young and pouty the colour palette might be called Late Cadaver and the mood is squalid and foreboding. In a few days we learn a quack doctor will come by and give poor Baby Doll a lobotomy (or should that be called a Doll-otomy?) But then Baby Doll slips into a new dimension and no this isnt a mental hospital its a bordello The sleazy orderly (Oscar Isaac) who admitted Baby Doll into the hospital has transformed into a mustache-sporting pimp. The psychologist with the Russian accent (Carla Gugino) is now an imperious ballet mistress training the girls in their burlesque routines for a special clientele. The doctor who is to come in a few days to mash her front lobe is now known as ""the High Roller"" a client who will buy her virginity. Baby Doll is told to dance to show off her stuff. Instead she zones out mentally travelling through space and time to a Chinese temple where a wrinkled guru (Scott Glenn) tells her she has a series of tasks. But first she must fight a trio of giant robot warriors with glowing red eyes. Suddenly she discovers martial arts prowess she didnt know she had. And when she pops back into her body in the bordello everyone agrees shes a pretty good dancer. Later Baby Doll gets the other girls involved in her plans for escape. They form one of those girls-in-their-underwear action teams including Rocket (Jena Malone) and her sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). Mostly they dress in burlesque costumes and fight off the advances of the obese cook. At other times they join Baby Doll as she flies away again fighting zombie German soliders dragons in besieged medieval castles and robots in tin suits. With each battle Baby Doll keeps adding to her inventory of precious objects - a map a fire a knife a key - which are supposed to allow for her escape. After each episode you keep expecting a dialogue box inviting you to press the ""Save"" button. Throughout Snyder accompanies the action with classic rock remixes from different periods. There are spacey cover versions of everything from Eurythmics Sweet Dreams (Are made of This) The Beatles Tomorrow Never Knows and Jefferson Airplanes White Rabbit augmenting the impression that the movie may have been inspired by a particularly unpleasant series of drug episodes.

Though at times envigorating the film is void of emotional heft and never delves deeper than a superficial video-game-style reality. Starring Vanessa Hudgens Emily Browning Jamie Chung Jena Malone Abbie Cornish Director Zack Snyder Running time 200 Release Opened Mar 25 2011  Editorial Review Fantasy movie is a palpable hit only for extreme boysBy Mark JenkinsFriday March 25 2011An extremely boyish ode to girl power ""Sucker Punch features dragons cyborgs German soldiers giant zombie samurai and five scantily clad women warriors. Director Zack Snyder and his production crew clearly had great fun envisioning this swords-and-corsets fantasy. Few others are likely to approach their level of enjoyment. This is the first film that Snyder whose credits include ""300 and ""Watchmen didnt adapt from a book comic or previous movie. That doesnt mean its original. ""Sucker Punch is a mash-up of action-flick music-video and video-game commonplaces delivered at a speed that makes it sometimes invigorating yet never surprising. The central character is Babydoll (plush-lipped Emily Browning) whose attempt to protect her little sister from their hateful stepfather goes wrong. Shes dispatched to a Dickensian asylum where a small bribe is required to have her scheduled for a lobotomy. But then the hospital is somehow transformed into a nightclub/brothel and the Polish-accented psychiatrist (Carla Gugino) becomes the dance instructor. Babydoll is outfitted in a sexy-schoolgirl outfit that exposes her midriff and thighs and she meets the similarly underdressed Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) Rocket (Jena Malone) Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). They too are inmates dancers and/or prostitutes. This doesnt sound like the dream world into which the troubled Babydoll would choose to escape. Could it have been selected for her by say a bunch of guys? Before she can settle into bordello life Babydoll finds herself in yet another world. She lands in a medieval Japanese temple where shes greeted by a monk (Scott Glenn probably chosen for his resemblance to David ""Kung Fu Carradine). He gives her a few weapons and some Zen-like wisdom and leaves her to battle those giant zombie samurai. Babydoll then returns to the ""real world and recruits her new friends for three more fantasy quests in which they can win the tools they need to escape the asylum (or whatever it is). All this hopping between alternate unrealities allows the filmmakers to employ various color schemes and visual styles which are more entertaining than the story. ""Sucker Punch also relies heavily on a conceptual soundtrack which features older rock songs performed by contemporary female vocalists (including Browning). The movie is packed with carnage and destruction but at the video game level of authenticity. Then in the final act our heroines feel the sting of death. This seems wrong. Just because the filmmakers forgot until the last minute to give ""Sucker Punch any emotional heft that doesnt mean Babydoll and her pals should suffer more than they have. Fighting undead World War I soldiers while wearing fishnet stockings is punishment enough.Contains violence sexuality and profanity.

"Sucker Punch fails to connect - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Sucker Punch fails to connect By Tom Charity Special to CNN ""Sucker Punch"" features lots of spectacle and skin -- too much of it says reviewer Tom Charity. Emily Browning (center) stars. STORY HIGHLIGHTS""Sucker Punch"" stars Emily Browning Abbie Cornish Vanessa Hudgens Brownings character escapes into an alternative reality a bordello/burlesque houseTom Charity calls it ""a seedy desaturated overstimulated simulation of a real movie"" (CNN) -- Zack Snyder evidently had an awesome idea for a video game. But for some reason he decided to do it as a movie first. I mean its playing in movie theatres so I guess you would have to call it a movie albeit a sorry excuse for one. Snyder has accrued some status with younger fans through his boldly stylized retakes on George Romeros ""Dawn of the Dead"" Frank Millers ""300"" and Alan Moores ""Watchmen."" So far the raw material has been distinctive enough to camouflage Snyders increasingly threadbare bag of tricks toggling between slow and fast motion extreme close-ups and vertiginous long shots. He feeds back the kind of bastardized cinematic effects that comic books pop videos and games took from film in the first place. Its a high-impact low-return aesthetic that promotes a tawdry gloss above character and story. Talking of which ""Sucker Punch"" is Snyders first stab at original material. And when I say ""stab"" I mean he prods at it anxiously with a long blade as if he wants to make sure its well and truly dead. Sucker Punch is sexy RELATED TOPICS Movies Movie Reviews Entertainment If Snyder has any call on the attention of a reasonably intelligent adult -- and on the evidence of this sleazy atrocity thats a mighty big ""if"" -- its as a pioneer of a post-narrative cinema in which sensation and spectacle are paramount and situation is as fluid as a digital composite. Here he conjures giants zeppelins and dragons all in the blink of an eye. But are these things enough when they come out of thin air? Clearly not as ""Sucker Punch"" falls back repeatedly on the hoariest of melodramatic cliches. And so were treated to orphaned sisters abused and (in one case) murdered by an evil stepfather who commits the surviving girl (Emily Browning) to an asylum and bribes the warden to arrange a lobotomy. All this within the first three minutes. Browning -- known only as ""Baby Doll"" -- contrives a mental escape route into an alternative reality a bordello/burlesque house. But this too is a dangerous place controlled by rapacious men. She finds another rabbit hole in performing interpretative dance routines (which we never see) that transfix her captors while projecting herself and her fellow inmates -- including Abbie Cornish and Vanessa Hudgens -- into virtual reality adventure game scenarios a Shaolin temple duel; a WWI assignment behind enemy lines; a ticking time bomb; etc. etc. iReporter One out of five for ""Sucker Punch"" On some level these episodes are configured as empowering fantasies; the girls are pulling the triggers after all. Theyre also heavily fetishized affairs involving high heels suspenders and plenty of skin. Kudos to Snyder (who co-wrote the screenplay with Steve Shibuya) for letting his imagination run wild. Its just a pity that imagination is so drastically circumscribed by the lurid ""ho couture"" culture of shoot-em-ups and soft porn. In the end what can you say about a filmmaker who thinks nothing of laying a cover of the Eurythmics ""Sweet Dreams"" (lyric ""Some of them want to abuse you"") over scenes of a man menacing two young girls? Or the Pixies magisterial ""Where Is My Mind"" over the committal scene? That Snyder is unafraid of overstatement? Or that he imagines an audience as lobotomized as his benumbed Baby Doll? See the suckers here are the poor mugs who leave their dollars at the door. And for what? A seedy desaturated overstimulated simulation of a real movie. Schlock treatment for comatose gamers and a bomb with a bright pink cherry on top.

Critics have descended upon the new film from director Zack Snyder (300 Watchmen Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole) like vultures on roadkill. They excoriate it for being a PG-13 version of fanboy porn for creating a world of teen hotties in bordello bondage fighting dragons and Nazi zombies and then not delivering the lurid goods. ""Youve heard of films wanting their cake and eating it too?"" rants Slants estimable Ed Gonzalez. ""Sucker Punch promises cake and when you show up its fruitcake and youre like What the f-- is this s--? Because nobody likes fruitcake."" So naturally before Ive even seen Sucker Punch Im interested. I do like fruitcake movies -- not as in the heavy nut-filled Christmas confections but as in insanely visionary riffs that challenge the status quo in this the most timid stolid period in cinema history. Im the guy who loved the Wachowskis Speed Racer who put Terry Gilliams dystopian parable Brazil on the all-TIME 100 Movies list who found Charlie Kaufmans Synecdoche New York a mind-opening trip to madness. I thought that Snyder when he reprised 50 years of alternative American history in four minutes at the beginning of his 2009 film Watchmen devised one of the most powerful and teeming sequences of any modern film. Ill take a too-much movie over a too-little movie any day. Other reviewers are welcome to embrace the anodyne realism of The Kids Are All Right and Blue Valentine. Let me eat fruitcake. A quarter-century ago at Pasadenas Art Center College of Design Snyder numbered among his classmates Michael Bay (Transformers) and Tarsem Singh (The Fall); his own movies usually shot on bare stages with long takes bodies twirling in slo-mo and lots of green-screen work might be located at the midpoint between Bays pummeling soullessness and Singhs epic surrealism. Snyder made his name with garish movies based reverently on famed comics Frank Millers 300 Alan Moores Watchmen. Now with co-writer Steve Shibuya he tries an original story -- which is to say a pastiche of every lubricious girl-power film ever made. The premise back in the 1950s when twin teens are about to inherit their mothers fortune their wicked stepfather kills one of the girls pins the murder on the other -- Emily Brownings Baby Doll -- and sends her to the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane. (This impressive opening sequence is scored to the Eurhythmics 80s hit ""Sweet Dreams"" and youre supposed to connect the name of the asylum to the duos lead singer Annie Lennox.) Learning that she is to be lobotomized in five days Baby Doll soars or plunges into an alternate reality where the madhouse is a high-end whorehouse and her fellow inmates are her brothel sisters ready to join her in a five-part quest that could lead to their freedom. (See the top 10 movies of 2010.) You could say that Sucker Punch is a nymphet version of The Snake Pit or Shutter Island or a live-action green-screened redo of The Powerpuff Girls or Black Swan (Carla Gugino has the demanding dance master role here) with a higher nightmare quotient or an 82 million tribute to Jess Francos sublimely cheesy women-in-prison movies of the 70s or an Americanization of Norifumi Suzuki ""pinky violence"" melodramas (Girl Boss Guerrilla Sex and Fury) of the same decade or in its backstory about a decent girl deprived of her inheritance and consigned to grow up in a prisonlike environment a gloss on mid-19th-century classics from Jane Eyre to Little Dorrit. With the action scenes playing like production numbers in some high-concept musical youll be reminded of Julie Taymors Beatles fantasia Across the Universe. The visual palette suggests the creepy pastel paintings of Guy Peellaert (Rock Dreams); the fantasy battles with monsters and samurais echo the muscular landscapes of Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo. The movie is like an arrested adolescents Google search run amok. The teen boy who would get lost in that cyber wonderland -- hes also Sucker Punchs target demographic -- is meant to fixate on the five girls who go questing. Known only by their prostitute pseudonyms they include whey-haired sisters Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and Rocket (Jena Malone) a brunette called Blondie (High School Musicals Vanessa Hudgens) and the Asian Amber (Jamie Chung). Snyder doesnt bother much with differentiating these four as they may simply be personalities fever-dreamed by Baby Doll. Thats Browning who with the giant eyes puffy lips and fake eyelashes could be her own anime doll the whole package dressed in a Japanese schoolgirl outfit as retailored by Victorias Secret. (See photos of the movies best-loved costumes.) Odd then that the films erotic temperature is so tepid. That could be due to the restraints on leering imposed by a PG-13 rating but more because Snyder is a picturemaker not a moviemaker. Hes an art director not a dramatist. Even a movie that means to be hallucinatory -- and sets its big scenes to head songs like ""White Rabbit"" ""Where Is My Mind"" and the Beatles ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" -- has to energize the in-between talky parts with a little craft and tension. Sucker Punch has vast empty patches deserts of dead air especially in scenes dominated by the head villain Blue (Oscar Isaac) whose endless monologues could be a show reel of the thousand would-be De Niros or Turturros or Leguizamos who flunked their Actors Studio audition. (In Watchmen too Snyder got subpar work from some very sharp actors.) Too much of Sucker Punch gave me the feeling I was peering into a terrarium where the flora was gorgeous but the fauna sluggish. Doggedly hoping the movie would scale the heights of wretched excess I found that it wussed out on divine delirium; it lacked the courage of its basest pop-cultural convictions. I like this kind of movie -- just not this movie. Ultimately I guess Gonzalez was right Sucker Punch is the wrong kind of fruitcake. See the 100 best movies of all time. See TIMEs Hollywood covers.

"Sucker Punch review A real wallop |       NJ.com comments Sucker Punch review A real wallop Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 25 2011 at 755 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1055 AM View/Post Comments Clay EnosFrom left Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Emily Browning Scott Glenn Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung in ""Sucker Punch."" The movie world is full of ""reimaginings"" -- frequently told stories told again previously made movies made again all updated with a quick dusting of new music and effects. Well ""Sucker Punch"" is an ""imagining."" Directed and based on an original story by Zack Snyder -- the filmmaker who previously has made two comic-book visualizations a young-adult novel adaptation and a remake -- its pretty much his vision at last. And its pretty remarkable. Not sensible perhaps. The story itself is a pulped fiction a half-shredded assemblage of genre standbys -- World War I dogfights and medieval dragons gold-hearted whores and old dark homes for ""the mentally insane."" (As distinct from what? The physically insane?) But boy does Snyder make it fun to watch. The story seems to begin like a silent horror tale as -- in wordless near-monochrome -- we see the sad tale of Babydoll an abused minor whose evil stepfather fast-tracks her for a lobotomy. Except then she wakes up. And it seems like the real story begins as were told shes an orphan deposited in a bordello due to have her virginity sold. But Babydoll has a plan -- distract the men with dances while other girls help her plan an escape. Oh but every time Babydoll twirls she slips into a fantasy -- a violent ""Heavy Metal""-style adventure of her friends helping her slay monsters fly fighter planes and generally save the world all the while being advised by a wise Zen master. So no this is not a sensible story. Its definitely not a movie for people expecting one. But for pure filmmaking -- characters taking up half the foreground in close-up while events unfold behind them action speeding up or stopping on command a soundtrack of classic rock remixed or redone into droning trances -- its remarkable. Of course some of what this style is put in service of is juvenile or more accurately adolescent. This is a film that preaches female empowerment but keeps its characters in miniskirts. It wants to have its cheesecake and eat it too. Yet while lead Emily Browning barely goes beyond the sexy schoolgirl cliche Abbie Cornish -- far livelier here than in the recent ""Limitless"" -- goes deeper as the older wiser Sweetpea. Even Vanessa Hudgens mostly in the background as Blondie shows a toughness kept under wraps through all those high school musicals. Actually a musical would be a great choice for Snyder. With his preference for grand emotion over cool logic hes closer to Busby Berkeley and Baz Luhrmann than he thinks. (Being Snyder it would have to be a zombie musical.) If theres one real problem with this film its that the very fans it has been made for are as familiar with Snyders inspirations as he is. Although there is supposedly a wow of a twist ending -- that surprise knockout the title promises -- any real fan will see it coming. But there is still far more to see here than in other overstylized irony fests such as last years ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Scott Pilgrim."" And real interest in seeing what Zack Snyder does in his next movie. Ratings note The film contains fantasy violence and sexual situations. Sucker Punch (PG-13) Warner Bros. (110 min.) Directed by Zack Snyder. With Emily Browning Abbie Cornish Vanessa Hudgens. Now playing in New Jersey.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + With ""Sucker Punch Zack Snyder makes his bid for the big time. What the successes of ""300 and ""Watchmen werent enough? Not if he wants to be a showman-auteur in a league with Baz Luhrmann Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino.No such luck Zack but thanks for trying. The new movie is Snyders first original script -- cowritten with Steve Shibuya -- and its a surprisingly joyless mash-up of every bit of fanboy flotsam floating around in its makers cranium. It begins with the young lissome Babydoll (Emily Browning) framed for the murder of her sister and committed to the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane (thats what the sign says) by her pervert stepfather (Gerard Plunkett).This experience proves so traumatic that the heroine flees to the dank MTV whorehouse in her imagination where the asylum inmates become a hardy sisterhood looking to escape Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) becomes the madame and the evil orderly Blue (Oscar Isaac) serves as sadistic pimp. When things get too stressful there Babydoll plunges into a deeper level of fantasy-action set pieces involving medieval Japan WWI trench warfare WWII bomber runs and outer space.Thats right ""Sucker Punch is ""Inception for dummies.But what hasnt Snyder poured into this stew? The over-directed action scenes snap together ""Sailor Moon ""Sin City and ""Kill Bill like pieces of Lego. The most interesting visual idea is the giant two-legged tank with a happy bunny face but if youve seen the trailer youve seen the bit. Actually this is the rare movie that doesnt advance on its poster.As with ""300 ""Sucker Punch resembles a ripsnorting video game or the longest Super Bowl commercial ever made more than it does a movie. The soundtrack is jammed with ""Moulin Rouge-style modern rawk takes on the Stooges Roxy Music Queen and Bjork and the cinematography drains the movie of all colors except a bilious metallic sheen. For all its noise and supersonic style ""Sucker Punch is a drab drag.Somewhere in here is a genuinely subversive girls-in-prison movie and the talented cast certainly seems game Abbie Cornish as Sweet Pea Jena Malone as Rocket Vanessa Hudgens escaping Planet Disney as Blondie Jamie Chung as Amber. Theyre power babes looking for a socket to plug into.Instead Snyder dolls them up in Victorias Secret cast-offs hands them ginormous guns and forgets to let them have any fun. With all the trash culture he has absorbed youd think someone would have sat the director down with Russ Meyers ""Faster Pussycat Kill Kill Now those women knew how to sucker punch.

Case in point Sucker Punch a dazzling visual design that goes tone-deaf every time it opens its dumb mouth or makes claims to profundity. Zack Snyder who directed Watchmen 300 the animated Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole and a better-than-decent reboot of Dawn of the Dead flounders badly in this action-fantasy about babes in bondage. Snyders script written with Steve Shibuya is a recipe for a raunchy R-rated hellzapoppin that pussies out in this PG-13 safety zone. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews Sucker Punch in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers"" The movie Snyders first original comes off as a tease that cops out on its shoddy but kinky premise. Take Babydoll the films put-upon protagonist played with a perpetual pout and black undies by Emily Browning. Snyder outfits Babydoll in fetish gear but provides no character for Browning to play. Just surface. The time is the 1960s. The place is the Lennox House insane asylum where Babydoll - shaken by the death of her mother - is sent by her stepfather when she rebuffs his slobbering advances. Did I mention that Eurythmics ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" plays with sledgehammer irony as poor Babydoll is used and abused? It does. Photos Leading Ladies on the Cover of Rolling Stone In the loony bin Babydoll is tortured by Blue (Oscar Isaac portrays him as a sneer personified) with the help of Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) a dance teacher with an outrageous accent and stiletto heels to mark her personality. At night Blue helps the High Roller (Jon Hamm fire your agent) turn Lennox into a brothel where Babydoll can dirty-dance for the delectation of male creeps. Sucker Punch Brings Back the Event Soundtrack Director Zack Snyder Discusses Selecting and Producing the Songs For the Film Whats Babydoll to do? Bond with other girls just like herself of course. Theres brunette Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens miles from High School Musical) sassy Rocket (Jena Malone) reliable Amber (Jamie Chung) and protective Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish a fine actress slumming it). Are the girls real or figments of Babydolls imagination? Trust me you wont care. Not after they do useless Rockette dance numbers and natter on like rejects from Sex and the City. The Complete Archive Over 20 Years of Peter Travers Movie Reviews Now Online Do the fantastic five vanquish their male exploiters? No but they fantasize about it. At the first sign of nudity the censor-friendly camera cuts to dream scenes of the girls in warrior drag going medieval on the asses of giant snakes samurai with Gatling guns and the Orcs who serve dragons (""Dont wake the mother""). Scott Glenn plays the Wise Man who helps them gird for battle. I am not making this up. Snyder did letting timid incoherence run rampant from his head into ours. Talk about a pulled-punch movie.

Girl power Davesaid on Tuesday July 17 2012 90714 PMRichard I always check your reviews before seeing (or not seeing) a movie. Ive been a longtime fan so keep up the excellent work and thanks for taking on the burdensome task of handling the likes of pete on these sites. Looking forward to your upcoming reviews. jessaid on Wednesday June 27 2012 42939 PMcomplete waste of time with such a shit ending. yeah the cg scenes are cool but whats the point when it ends so terribly. Who the hell wants to watch a movie with a crap ending? David Bastardosaid on Saturday September 17 2011 101250 PMI have to say I had great expectations of this film when I first saw the trailers at the end of 2010. Yeah I was a 14 year old boy didnt have a girlfriend at the time and really wanted to see some cool beautiful girls in a fantasy action-packed movie it seemed very entertaining. However the movie was someway entirley different than the trailers and wanting to make the ending something of a ""smart choice"" is indeed hypocritical because the premise of the film is a male fantasy and that was what I was looking for. So if Snyder makes a movie thats ment for men and then ruins it entirley its very very sad and yeah Roeper is right yet again it is boring but not for the performances or the girls but for an overwhelming visual style music videoclips-like cinematography and unswallowable character (that of Oscar Isaac) and a horribly stupid end. Hey if you wish to entertain boys make something thats fun and not pathetically depressing. Mikesaid on Friday April 15 2011 111420 AMYou know Richard saying that the asylum is a front for a strip club isnt really simplifying things for the sake of the review it is saying something that is simply wrong. It throws off people who havent see the film and makes those who have question the your review if you got something so simple so wrong. If you wanted to simplify the review you could say something like that it then jumps back and shows the characters at a strip club. You can say that its confusing and comes out of nowhere because it is and it does. Fredsaid on Wednesday April 13 2011 22321 PM""As for ""Sucker Punch"" being hypocritical its pretty obvious. You throw in some narration about girl empowerment but counter that with visuals of twentysomething women dressed in schoolgirl fantasy sequences. Giving them big guns and having their skirts twirl above their waists as they kick and punch hardly counterbalances that."" Which makes me wonder What is the source of a twentysomething womans power? Attractiveness the will to use it and the intelligence to use it right. Otherwise nothing in particular. Girls are not empowered by downplaying their essential qualities. Brad Wrightsaid on Monday April 11 2011 75058 AMI hated the movie too Richard. It was a mess I believed too those girls could not act and people think they were acting because they did a lot of stunts. The action was okay probably the only highlight of the movie. Im a big fan of Zack Snyders Watchmen and 300 but this movie was disappointing. Dont listen to all these guys Richard they only hate your review because they just liked the action and didnt see the big picture of how much it sucked. I like your reviews. richard roepersaid on Friday April 08 2011 93846 AMPete Are you actually incapable of reading the explanation in this very section??? And IM the idiot. OK chief. Petesaid on Friday April 08 2011 92752 AMIts not really a front for a whorehouse idiot. Stephsaid on Friday April 01 2011 33910 PMI have been surprised with all of the vicious reviews of this film. Most of the musings have been from a male perspective I am a 29 year old female and I adored this film. I karate kicked the exit door to the theatre with glee while my heart was pounding from the visual and mental thrill ride. Was this movie perfect well-acted and seamlessly tied together? No. But people are not giving this film enough credit for its visual splendor and social commentary. I appreciated the uneasiness this movie created and the thoughtful soundtrack. Critics should take a moment to look beyond the obvious . Snyder thank you for Sucker Punch. Richard the ""Indecipherable hypocritical mess"" is an innovative sexy and visually spectacular triumph.

A soul-deadening mash-up of ""Kill Bill"" ""Showgirls"" and dozens of other better flicks thats not the least bit exciting or sexy Zack Snyders ""Sucker Punch"" is what happens when a studio gives carte blanche to a filmmaker who has absolutely nothing original or even coherent to say. A briefly seen Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"" performs a lobotomy on a young woman named Babydoll (Emily Browning) but by the end of two hours of humorless masturbatory non sequiturs from the director of ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" I was beginning to feel like an ice pick had been shoved into my eye socket. Certainly I was feeling zero emotional engagement with the travails of Babydoll an orphan whos stashed in a mental institution by her stepfather to await Hamms ministrations after being framed for her sisters murder. PHOTOS DISNEY STARS BRANCHING OUT The manual typewriters and reel-to-reel recorders seem to place the story in the early 60s at the latest but once the ice pick is inserted Babydoll is free to imagine herself and the institutions female inmates wearing outfits from the 1998 Victorias Secret catalog while performing to 80s techno-rock in a brothel. ""If you do not dance you have no purpose"" says a psychiatrist-cum-madam played by Carla Gugino with a heavy Polish-Hungarian accent. In perhaps the movies most perverse touch -- or maybe an attempt by Warner Bros to use a PG-13 rating to grab as much business as it can before word-of-mouth gets out -- we never see a single step of Babydolls allegedly sizzling dances much less her and the other inmates erotic interactions with clients. Instead when Babydoll goes into her dance she closes her eyes and we get a series of increasingly tiresome video game/music video sequences placing Babydoll and her joyless comrades -- imaginatively named Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) Rocket (Jena Malone) Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung) -- in ancient China the battlefields of World War I medieval Europe and outer space. Urged on by Scott Glenn -- doing his best David Carradine zen impression while piloting a World War II bomber -- they battle fire-breathing dragons zombie soldiers and orcs while zeppelins and trains explode in the background. Mostly these are exotic backdrops for endless close-ups of the inexpressive Brownings milky white thighs and bottom. Instead of titillating this attention to the female form is merely boring since Snyder (who is no Quentin Tarantino in the dialogue department) truly lacks the courage of his bad taste not to mention an R rating. Meanwhile back in the other layer of fantasy Babydoll and her comrades are plotting to escape from their captor (Oscar Isaac) but the narrative logic of these scenes is even skimpier than the actresses costumes. Certainly theres no sense of peril whatsoever even as Snyder frantically loads on homages to everyone from Orson Welles to Sam Fuller to Peter Jackson. As far as I can tell the title of ""Sucker Punch"" refers to anyone who ponies up 12.50 (19 for IMAX) to see the years worst movie so far. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Kors Madison Avenue Flagship opens this week Read Next Kors Madison Avenue Flagship opens this week Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 16323 How Hillary blew her big moment 9617 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 6874 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday March 25 2011 400 AM Title Sucker Punch With Emily Browning Abbie Cornish. Action thriller about young women trapped in an institution.  Director Zack Snyder (149). PG-13 sexuality violence. At area theaters.If I were to guess how Hollywood envisions the inside of a teenage boys brain it would look exactly like Zack Snyders ""Sucker Punch.""But even 14-year-olds should be warned While explosions gunfights and barely-clad beauties wielding heavy artillery sounds like fun Snyders ""Maxim""-style action thriller is also is bound to wear down anyone looking for say coherent filmmaking.Though it feels like any other jackhammer video-game adaptation Snyder (""Watchmen"" ""300"") created the concept in which several abused girls (Abbie Cornish Vanessa Hudgens Jena Malone Jamie Chung) wind up in a nightmarish mental institution.For reasons that exist only as an excuse to costume the cast in lingerie newly-arrived Baby Doll (Emily Browning) imagines that theyre actually in a nightclub run by Blue (Oscar Isaac). Vera (Carla Gugino) trains them to dance encouraging them to give customers whatever they want -- on stage and off.Back in reality a doctor (Jon Hamm) is scheduled to perform a lobotomy on Baby Doll within days. Her escape plans are inspired by dreams within her fantasy so every time she dances she enters a third world in which the girls conquer various CGI villains. Zombie soldiers dragons cyborgs doesnt matter Snyder is just a big boy with lots of toys.These unfortunately include his actresses. Back stories barely exist and the tedious action choreography makes far more of their figures than fight skills. Meanwhile stilted exchanges suggest they were given little direction. Theyre simply required to look great in thigh-high stockings until they meet their careless fates.Guginos deadpan Polish accent suggests theres an element of high camp here that could have made for some fun. But none of the fantasies shows the slightest imagination -- ""expensive"" is the best way to describe the chaotic effects -- and the flat visuals hardly evoke the graphic novels Snyder intends to reference.As for the more established actors their presence ranges from baffling (way to waste your ""Mad Men"" hiatus Jon Hamm) to downright depressing. Was Abbie Cornish truly this desperate?""Sucker Punch"" never pretends to be anything more than a money-making spectacle. But even if he were determined to keep the cast unclothed surely Snyder could have tried to cover up his cynicism.

"Comic book meets video game in Sucker Punch - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Comic book meets video game in Sucker Punch By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Say this for Zack Snyders latest homage to geekdom Youve never seen a movie like Sucker Punch. And depending on your entertainment preferences you may not want to. Warner Bros. via AP Baby Doll (Emily Browning) and Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) star in Sucker Punch. EnlargeClose Warner Bros. via AP Baby Doll (Emily Browning) and Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) star in Sucker Punch. Written like a comic book and shot like a video game Sucker Punch may be Hollywoods ultimate ""fanboy"" flick. Characters follow byzantine missions against faceless villains. The women as they do in so many superhero tales lounge in tight blouses and tiny skirts -- barely enough upon which to hang their ninja swords. Though that may delight comic book devotees (and fans of the Japanese anime story Sailor Moon whose characters bear a striking resemblance to Punchs) it wont do much for fans of say narrative plot or character. All are woefully lacking in this story written and directed by Snyder whose last film was the R-rated comic book adaptation Watchmen. The story such as it is centers on Baby Doll (a pursed-lipped Emily Browning) who is institutionalized by her wicked stepfather and hatches a plan to free her fellow patients as well as her active imagination. There are a few star turns here including Jon Hamm and Carla Gugino as mysterious doctors. But the bulk of the movie rests on the lithe backs of Browning Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone. Not that theyre asked to do much besides look good decaptitating bad guys. About the movie Sucker Punch  out of fourStars Emily Browning Jena Malone Jamie Chung Abbie Cornish Vanessa Hudgens Director Zack Snyder Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for violence language and some sexual content Running time 2 hours Opens Friday nationwide A self-proclaimed nerd Snyder has clearly let his geek flag fly. The script is divided into four parts and larded with video game missions such as finding crystals from a serpents neck to create a magical fire. But Snyder knows how to shoot a comic book movie. Sucker Punch looks a lot like his historical action hit 300 and has about as much depth. The good guys are pure as driven snow the villains as dark as slush. Still the action sequences scored by a blistering techno soundtrack are top-notch and prevalent. The secret to watching Sucker Punch like most of Snyders films is to stop looking for reason. Punch is more interested in explosions than exposition. As popcorn action the film has some effective sequences especially when our heroes get down to swordplay. And Snyder may have unwittingly created a movie to discuss. Are his scantily clad protagonists the ultimate in film feminism or the embodiment of nerd sexism? There may not be an answer in Sucker Punch but die-hard fans will have plenty to sift through. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Starring Emily Browning Vanessa Hudgens Jamie Chung and Abbie Cornish. Directed by Zack Snyder. (PG-13. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Though Zack Snyder is known as an action director (""300"" ""Watchmen"") he is a genuine artist and one of the most exciting and promising filmmakers to emerge in the past 10 years. His new movie ""Sucker Punch"" - lets just say it - is a failure but theres so much talent on that screen that the movie cant be dismissed as a waste of time. Or at least not a complete waste of time. With other action directors even some good ones you get the sense of people working mechanically - that they have an idea for something they want to see and then assemble it using actors props and computers. But Snyder seems to work internally and intuitively so that no matter how overpowering the action there is always room for unconscious inspiration for details that make only psychological or emotional sense A young woman has her blouse ripped by her stepfather and Snyder pauses to show the shirt button in slow motion twirling to a stop on the floor. That moment occurs in the brilliant first sequence of ""Sucker Punch"" a miniature silent movie in which our heroine Baby Doll (Emily Browning) endures the death of her mother brutalization by her stepfather and commitment to a nightmarish mental institution. All this is communicated with style and specificity and with shots that reverberate through the mind a blue eye staring out in horror through a keyhole. Related Stories Sucker Punch Snyder gives us a film that takes place in three worlds or rather levels of consciousness. In the first world which we take to be the real world Baby Doll has been institutionalized and must escape before she is given a lobotomy. In the second world which might also be real she has been sold into white slavery and lives in a brothel with other women where she has to dance for customers. Finally the third world is made up of Baby Dolls fantasies the dreams of destruction triumph and freedom that she has every time she dances. In this way Snyder is attempting to do something similar to what Guillermo del Toro did in ""Pans Labyrinth."" In fact hes trying to go del Toro one better Instead of giving us two parallel worlds he is giving us three each commenting on the other. Indeed the very first time Baby Doll goes into her dance and lands in some ancient temple fighting three armored monsters it seems that Snyders inventiveness and imagination are without limit. Yet ironically its precisely at that point that the limits of ""Sucker Punch"" are defined. This film marks the first time that Snyder has made a film from his own original story and everything thats wrong with ""Sucker Punch"" - and in the end fatal - derives from that story. All too soon the movie degenerates into a formula one in which at certain intervals Baby Doll dances and we in the audience are force-fed another action sequence - each one longer and less interesting than the last. The story of Baby Dolls attempts at escape the real story is abandoned for interminable stretches. Moreover in a film whose approach must be justified in psychological terms there are nagging imprecisions. Whose fantasies are these? What are the parallels either factual or emotional between the actions in one world and the next? In a sense these are the little things Snyder needed to work out meticulously if only for the sake of letting his imagination run free within these wide constraints. Instead we get the opposite an imagination cramped by too unsure a grasp of what will fit and what wont. In the end Snyder confuses going ugly for getting serious and he destroys his movie completely. To talk about the acting in a film like this is pointless. The young women are decorative images to be manipulated or sometimes just photographed lovingly paired in front of mirrors as they talk looking at each other their reflections looking elsewhere. Theyre fine but this is Snyders show all the way. I just hope he doesnt misinterpret what I expect will be the reception of ""Sucker Punch"" as punishment for being artistic. Its just a bad screenplay. Not everyone has to be a writer. To be a first-class director is rare enough. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations scenes of violence and emotional torment.

Posted April 5 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT Assaulted by the pounding monotonous violence and derivative videogame scenarios of Sucker Punch my hostage eyeballs began to flicker much like those of Babydoll (Emily Browning) the child-woman waif whose degrading travails provide this fantasy with its nonsensical action. (Not for nothing did the Australian-born Browning previously star as Violet Baudelaire in Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events.) Because of a load of genre melodrama unfurled at the start of the movie you see Babydoll has been locked away in an old-timey creepy insane asylum with unorthodox psychotherapy overseen by Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino up to her own eyeballs in eye shadow) a distant relative perhaps of Cloris Leachmans Frau Blucher in Young Frankenstein. There are other psycho-slut-clad girls sequestered with Babydoll bruised cuties played by Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung. But its Babydolls fantasies/psychotic breaks that turn writer-director Zack Snyder on. Snyder now at work on the newest Superman movie created a cool remake of George Romeros Dawn of the Dead in 2004 before getting mired in the fetishistic soulless visual style of 300 and Watchmen. And here Babydolls behind-the-eyelids retreats into convoluted dream states let the filmmaker go wild loud fetishistically stylized and...numbingly dull. Imagining that she and her inmate friends are pay-for-play girls in a brothel run by Madam G and that Babydolls specialty is dirty-dancing for special clients the girl slips into a series of unfortunate altered game-board universes in which she and the other gals fight their way past Nazi ghosts serpents anime monsters bomber pilots and you know the usual 1-D characters. Scott Glenn shows up as a Wise Man who guides the girls-within-the-games. Zack Snyder ought to pay a big samplers fee to Quentin Tarantino for the Kill Bill storytelling techniques. The music screeches the actors vamp the knives and weapons and bombs and fireballs fly around the screen. Meanwhile the well-prepared moviegoer slips into her or his own private fantasy of a world in which movie effects are themselves locked away in an institution for the criminally insane until such time as those effects are really truly necessary for the story.

Our heroine in a no-exit corner we shift abruptly into what is presumably Baby Dolls psychogenic fugue state in which she imagines herself among a stable of alt-porn-y chicks imprisoned in a bordello by some guys dressed as lounge singers. When forced to dance for her captors Baby Doll escapes still deeper into ""empowering"" non sequitur action-combat stages her fantasies looking remarkably like the daydreams of an adolescent GamePro reader. The video-game frame of reference is confirmed when Scott Glenn pops up at the beginning of each level to deliver nostrums and mission objectives sending the girls after ""a map fire a knife and a key"" (all thats missing is an inventory menu). Director Zack Snyders dispensing with any explanatory exposition--hence the blindsiding implicit in the title--makes this King Ludwig-size extravagance marginally less dreary than Inception. But his mash-up set pieces (""Call of Duty"" meets ""Castlevania"" etc.) blend into so-awesome-theyre-awful slo-mo monotony and the awful sisterhood stuff in between makes you anticipate the action as though waiting for the bus.

The French call it ""homage"" but Zack Snyder prefers the term ""mash-up"" which is no doubt a more appropriate way to describe the cacophonous half-digested mass of pop-culture influences that make up ""Sucker Punch"" a crass womens penitentiary picture reconceived for todays manga- and vidgame-savvy crowd. Misleadingly positioned as female empowerment despite clearly having been hatched as fantasy fodder for 13-year-old guys this sensory-overload exercise tarts up six actresses in service of various ""Heavy Metal""-style scenarios -- a setup likely to sucker fanboys while leaving those who crave humanity and good old-fashioned storytelling feeling like cavemen whove stumbled into Times Square. With ""Watchmen"" Warners dubbed Snyder a ""visionary director"" and here we get to see just what said vision amounts to as the helmer is left to his own devices on his first wholly original project. Although Snyder concocted the setup from scratch the meticulously storyboarded compositions still feel like frames lifted from a graphic novel fragmenting the narrative into a sequence of iconic images disconnected enough that the audience must still work to decipher their meaning. After losing her only two blood relatives in a bad-taste prologue Emily Brownings ""Babydoll"" character (the actress ""Lemony Snicket"" role was a mere warm-up for the unfortunate events ahead here) is committed to Lennox House an asylum where shes scheduled to receive a lobotomy in five days time. Rather than face harsh reality Babydoll plunges into her own imagination upgrading the maximum-security hospital to a high-end bordello where she and her fellow inmates (Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung playing nymphets with names like Sweet Pea and Rocket) are forced to dance for an assortment of grotesque men. Only in Snyders mind could this scenario be seen as any less degrading than living in a mental institution which explains why Babydoll must invent a second fantasy layer where she can escape every time she is called upon to perform an exotic dance. While her call-girl avatar shimmies offscreen for the lecherous warden (Oscar Isaac) and his cronies including Carla Gugino as a badly Russian-accented madam we see Babydoll transported into various gonzo vidgame missions facing off against giant samurai Nazi zombies fire-breathing dragons and mechanized robots while a weathered Scott Glenn serves as her bumper-sticker-quoting sensei/spirit guide. As dream sequences go these overloaded and inelegant action scenes inspired by such fanboy staples as role-playing games anime the Frank Miller oeuvre and racy Sorayama-style paintings are the last thing one might expect from the mind of a traumatized lass however refreshing it may be to see young actresses going all ""Kill Bill"" on platoons of bad guys. Like Quentin Tarantino Snyder is unapologetic about his influences -- the trashier the better -- though hes far less skilled in the art of pastiche. Rather than creating a coherent new narrative from these assorted lowbrow sources ""Sucker Punch"" attempts to mash everything into the same CG frame. The environmental effects look great lending an apocalyptic air to Babydolls mini-adventures. But the actresses seem out of place against these backdrops -- not on account of their gender but because costume designer Michael Wilkinson outfits them in demeaning fetish gear objectifying the ladies much as Snyder did the Spartan hardbodies in ""300."" Browning may be old enough to vote but shes been made to look like jailbait with her wide-eyed stare and Sailor Moon-style Japanese schoolgirl uniform. Though most of her stunts are handled by a badly matched digital double to her credit Browning does perform three songs on Tyler Bates and Marius de Vries raucous classic-rock-cover soundtrack which may well be the projects most impressive bit of recycling. ""Sucker Punch"" reportedly shed nearly an entire reels worth of footage in order to land a PG-13 rating and even then the film feels highly inappropriate for young viewers. From the opening scene young ladies seem to be under constant threat of being raped or murdered by grown men and cutting around the brutality doesnt diminish the effect at all. If this is where Snyders imagination goes when hes free to create his own material maybe hes better off sticking to adaptations.

Dark dreary and action-packed CGI epic must count on fanboy culture to respond in a big way. TWITTER Director Zack Snyders storytelling skills remain in question in his latest CGI spectacular. Certain to create a gaping divide between generational and aesthetic camps Sucker Punch is a largely grim and unpleasant display of technical wizardry wrapped around a story that purports to be inspirational. Enshrouded in a fantastical and dark heavy metal mindset and populated by characters that resemble standbys in a road company of Showgirls Zack Snyders latest CGI action spectacular is constructed to allow for any kind of flight of fancy he can dream up. But because theyre figments of a girls imagination nothing is at stake resulting in minimal suspense or rooting interest. Hot anticipation from fanboys and the strong female angle suggest big box office potential for this Warner Bros. release at least at the outset but these constituencies have proved increasingly fickle and unreliable of late. With the artistic novelty and commercial success of Dawn of the Dead and 300 Snyder quickly vaulted into primetime. But his storytelling skills came increasingly into question with Watchmen and the awful Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole issues that remain in the episodic Sucker Punch which is built so as to dispense with the need for narrative logic. The director who wrote the screenplay with Steve Shibuya tries to compensate with his visual skills which are considerable and on display at their best in the disturbing prologue which in a few minutes reveals how a girl known only as Babydoll came to end up in a Vermont insane asylum in the early 1960s. Relating the sad tale in strongly expressive visual terms that show real aptitude for silent-film storytelling Snyder quickly shows how Babydoll (Emily Browning) was betrayed by a dreadful stepfather when her mother died and framed for his murder of her younger sister putting her on the fast track for a lobotomy at the Lennox House for the Criminally Insane a creepy old joint in the darkest dankest Victorian tradition. However the social hall has been transformed into a seedy nightclub where the girls receive dance instruction from an Eastern European ""doctor"" (Carla Gugino) and then perform for select big shots glad-handed by the establishments sleazy proprietor Blue (Oscar Isaac). The teeny Babydoll quickly becomes tight with sisters Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and Rocket (Jena Malone) and tough chicks Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung) and is given the potential means of escaping Lennox by a gringo Wise Man (Scott Glenn) who presides over an Asian temple. He presents her with a list of five items she must retrieve on a series of hair-raising adventures. The set-up prescribes that Babydoll enters the world of her imagination whenever she dazzles her special clientele with her dancing (which we never see) and fights the good fight with her girl team which will somehow facilitate their mutual escape from the asylum. Audiences who have no problem with this fabricated cause-and-effect mechanism will probably be fine with the film which in relatively quick succession presents the girls engaged in wild warfare in an assortment of scenically perilous settings including World War I battlefronts an ancient castle guarded by winged fire-breathing beasts and a world filled with Robocop-style warriors. These blazing slashing swooping diving roaring screaming demolishing battles which employ a variety of cool aircraft and the most exotic weapons imaginable are the meat of Sucker Punch and are choreographed in an epic manner only possible with advanced CGI. The explosions spearings decapitations and all-out mayhem much of it executed with the sort of elegant moves and delayed aerial suspension pioneered in The Matrix will delight fans who crave this sort of thing from movies above all else. But the dreamlike or imaginary context in which these sequences are presented automatically drains them of any sense of engagement; just as you cant die in your own dreams so too nothing bad can really happen to the five girls in these adventures where the rules of engagement are anything Snyder wants them to be. This still leaves real life inside the asylum of course where things do get hairy and take a couple of startling turns before the longed-for escape can be attempted. But even then the climactic inspirational spin about the abiding powers of the imagination feels either like a theme unrealized by the film itself or a slogan tacked onto an insufficiently coherent concept. Led by Isaacs thinly mustachioed slime-bucket asylum entrepreneur the baddies are distinctly unappetizing company while the girls often in heavy performance makeup and looking off-puttingly (rather than fetchingly) vulgar dont entirely gel. For starters physically they dont remotely belong in the early 1960s; even though cultural realism couldnt be further from the films concerns why specifically set it then if youre going to ignore period plausibility? Brownings dyed platinum hair is distracting for such a young character at the time most of the dialogue is blatantly contemporary and the wall-of-sound music much of it consisting of elaborate re-dos of the likes of Jefferson Airplane the Beatles Queen and Iggy Pop sometimes effective in their own right provides an additional level of historical dislocation. Technically the film is unquestionably aces.

"Sucker Punch (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Sucker Punch (PG-13) This Babydoll packs a punch. Emily Browning as Babydoll in Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures epic action fantasy ""Sucker Punch"". Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/24/2011 Let us briefly recount the career of filmmaker Zack Snyder. He made his directorial debut with 2004s Dawn of the Dead a remake of the George A. Romero zombie classic that satisfied old-school fans and newcomers. His star in Hollywood rose after the mega-success of 300 a panel-by-panel recreation of the Frank Miller graphic novel that took the bullet-time photography of The Matrix to a new level. Next he accomplished what several other filmmakers had deemed impossible He made a movie out of the seminal comic-book series Watchmen. Last year he directed his first kid-friendly film Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole based on the childrens book by Kathryn Lasky. Now with Sucker Punch his first film based on an original story (he wrote the screenplay with Steve Shibuya a former special-effects artist) Snyder cements his standing as one of the most gifted visual fantasists working in movies today. In Sucker Punch you can see traces of all the films that led Snyder to this point The fantastical action of 300 the comic-book roots of Watchmen the nightmarish horror of Dawn the innocent wonder of GaHoole. Entirely new is the pointedly feminist overtone The heroes in Sucker Punch are all women. The men with one notable exception are all monstrous (or monsters). The story centers on Babydoll (Emily Browning) an orphan falsely accused of murdering her little sister and imprisoned inside an asylum where she is scheduled for a lobotomy. Before the procedure can be completed Babydoll disappears into an alternate reality that exists entirely in her mind. There she and four fellow inmates (Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung) are performers in a bordello managed by the theatrical Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and run by the cruel pimp Blue (Miamis Oscar Isaac). In order to escape -- the cathouse and the mental institution -- the girls must first fight off winged dragons zombies giant ninja robots and android aliens and collect five talismans. No Sucker Punch doesnt make any sense. But none of that matters because the ride Snyder takes you on is so vividly conceived so deliriously bizarre and wonderful. The movie provides all the bearings you need in this imaginary world so that youre never really confused even when the action is set inside a dream within a dream a la Inception. That action is tremendous. Sucker Punch is first and foremost a visual experience. The first 10 minutes or so unfold without dialogue save for a bit of voiceover narration recounting how the perfectly sane Babydoll wound up at a hospital for the insane. As Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) blasts on the soundtrack (sung by Browning in an ominous growl) Snyder tells his story entirely through images and those images provide everything you need to know about the girls wicked stepfather her little sister and the tragedy that befalls her. Snyder is in complete control of his craft in that opening sequence -- its a bravura piece of filmmaking -- and that feeling extends to Sucker Punchs fantasy sequences. As the heroines go into combat on a World War I battlefield against steampunk soldiers invade a medieval castle or board a speeding train on an alien planet the movie becomes a thrilling comic book by way of Heavy Metal. Freed from the responsibility of having to stay faithful to someone elses source material Snyder lets his imagination run wild and each shot becomes a panel in a beautifully illustrated graphic novel. You turn its pages slowly in order to savor the elegance of the artwork. The title Sucker Punch refers not to an element in the story but to the movies effect on the viewer. Just about the moment you think you know what the film is all about Snyder pulls the rug out from under you and the story becomes something entirely different. Snyder is the rare kind of popular entertainer who isnt afraid of grim endings -- he knows that the best fairy tales are often the darkest -- and he trusts his audience to understand and savor what hes up to here. Not everyone will dig Sucker Punch especially viewers who obsess over pesky matters of character development or simple logic. The movie lacks the emotional resonance of a true classic but it compensates by tickling your imagination with a rapturous transporting glee. The movie is a head trip of the most awesome kind -- one I cant wait to take again.

"Sucker Punch Dawn of the dolls | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSucker Punch Dawn of the dollsThe girl-powered action epic Sucker Punch has a lot of cool fighting but also a story that could leave you reeling.Emily Browning and Carla Gugino in Sucker Punch.  (Warner Bros. Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 24 2011 Sucker Punch (out of 4) Starring Emily Browning Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens Jamie Chung Carla Gugino and Scott Glenn. Directed by Zack Snyder. 110 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 14A Zack Snyder the kinetic filmmaker who made zombies and Spartans run owls talk and blue giants swing is up to something else entirely with Sucker Punch. What that is exactly is hard to fathom but lets try. Sucker Punch is a girl-powered Sailor Moon anime crossed with a Russ Meyer sexploitation flick. Its Shutter Island Inception Kill Bill a video game and your worst nightmare mashed up. It provides sporadic seconds of splendid eye candy separated by minutes of muddled exposition and flat acting. Overall its a disappointment a failure not so much of vision but of focus. This is Snyders first movie based on an original story (although it all depends on how you define ""original"") and it seems he and co-scripter Steve Shibuya opted to use every idea that entered their fevered skulls. You can just imagine how many scribbles are on the cocktail napkin of their first meeting. Actually you dont have to imagine since they all ended up on the screen. The movie sends you reeling but probably not in the way Snyder intends. Set in the 1950s and shot with a similar desaturated colour palette as his Spartan hit 300 Snyders latest is bookended by a gothic horror story in which our late-teen heroine Babydoll (Emily Browning) is framed as the cause of a family tragedy. Shes sent by her evil stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) to Lennox House an insane asylum where mental illness is treated with deprivation abuse and lobotomies. The curiously inert Babydoll is informed by the shady house doc Blue (Oscar Isaac) that she will have involuntary brain surgery in five days hence. It will be performed by a sawbones played by Jon Hamm (TVs Mad Men) in a procedure that resembles an ice pick being driven into an eye socket. But wait Suddenly we are in an alternate universe where Blue is the director of a nightclub/whorehouse his assistant Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) is the choreographer/madam and Babydoll is expected to perform various acts of dubious morality. She has company all beauties in bondage like herself and dressed like saucy schoolgirls Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and her sister Rocket (Jena Malone) plus friends Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). No one is allowed out of Lennox House but some measure of escape can be found through dancing. Babydolls moves are apparently so extraordinary (we never see them) they transport her to yet another alternate universe where she meets a Zen figure played by Scott Glenn at his acerbic best. He tells Babydoll that she needs to acquire five items -- a map fire a knife a key and something mysterious to be revealed later -- in order to free herself. He pops up throughout the film offering bromides that he punctuates with ""One more thing. . ."" like Steve Jobs teasing an audience of Apple fanboys. His most important parting shot ""Defend yourself"" This Babydoll does in a series of action set pieces that are the strongest parts of Sucker Punch. Rocking to new covers of old tunes by the likes of Bjork the Beatles and Jefferson Airplane Babydoll and her fellow babes enjoin a bewildering array of baddies. Every time Babydoll goes into her dance trance a different set of villains emerges zombie German soldiers from World War I Asian battle robots with Pinocchio noses and glowing red eyes and so on. The visuals are striking representing Snyders wildest flights of fancy. But theyre so packed with details and random pop-cult references its like consuming an entire box of chocolates. Thankfully its not in 3-D otherwise your eyeballs might explode. After a while you might wish as I did that you could just watch Babydoll dance since everybody raves about her. No such luck. Character development is similarly missing in action. Only Cornish manages to invest her Amazon with anything resembling a real personality. The story fails to satisfy or to make any sense whatsoever. Its the first real dud by Snyder who has impressed with his past films 300 Dawn of the Dead The Watchmen and even Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole. Sucker Punch leaves you feeling like the movie title but in the past tense.

"One mans fantasy is anothers torture - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs One mans fantasy is anothers torturePunch a salacious mess dances into theaters -- 0 starsMarch 24 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticEmily Browning in ""Sucker Punch.""""Sucker Punch"" is certainly the strangest dance musical of all time. Each time the female protagonist goes into her bump-and-grind the routine is depicted as a video gamers fantasy of violent combat against zombie Germans in World War I or cyborgs or dragons. Its like Roxie Hart of ""Chicago"" ran off for the weekend with some pimply adolescent Xbox fiend.The film abdicates so many basic responsibilities of coherent storytelling even coherent stupid-action-movie storytelling director/co-writer/co-producer Zack Snyder must have known in preproduction that his greasy collection of near-rape fantasies and violent revenge scenarios disguised as a female-empowerment fairy tale wasnt going to satisfy anyone but himself. Well himself plus ardent fans of Japanese-schoolgirl manga comics. ""Close your eyes. Open your mind. You will be unprepared"" is the movies ad slogan. Indeed. You will be unprepared for a film packing this much confusing crud into a little less than two hours of solitary confinement which feels more like dog hours i.e. 14.Unlike Snyders ""300"" (which I rather enjoyed) and ""Watchmen"" (which I didnt) ""Sucker Punch"" co-written by Steve Shibuya is by loosest definition an original not based on a graphic novel. The time is the 1960s. Up in Brattleboro Vt. a salacious greedy quasi-incestuous stepfather commits his stepdaughter to an asylum. With a lobotomy in her near future this young woman Babydoll joins forces with a few other tough-as-nails unfortunates -- Sweet Pea Rocket Blondie and Amber -- and plots an escape.But wait The movies really taking place inside Babydolls incessant dream life. Whenever she dances she imagines herself and her comrades to be warriors in battles across space and time taking and meting out all sorts of pain. But wait Those fantasies are really part of another Babydoll fantasy wherein shes a kind of brothel employee under the thumb of a sharkskin weasel named Blue who uses the brothel to front for various illegal activities. The ladies undergo what appears to be dance-therapy led by Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino). When Babydoll ""dances"" the ""dancing"" is never shown; the ""dancing"" is shown metaphorically as martial arts and ""Call of Duty"" and who knows what else all monitored by the leader known as Wise Man (Scott Glenn).The script seems to have undergone a series of small strokes and right in the middle of ""Sucker Punch"" is Emily Browning an utter blank as Babydoll. Only Abbie Cornishs Sweet Pea and Guginos Gorski bring any sense of natural authority or charisma to Snyders private party. ""All that gyrating and moaning ... the dance should be more than just titillation"" Cornish tells Browning after her first ""number."" In a film thats largely about thighs and cleavage and blurring the line between fetishized weaponry and other objects of desire that line is a hypocritical joke. So is the films rating. ""Sucker Punch"" got by with a PG-13. Id like someone to see it and then see ""Win Win"" which got an R rating for a few ""F"" words and then defend the Motion Picture Association of Americas Ratings and Classifications board and their priorities with a straight face.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic material involving sexuality violence and combat sequences and for language)Cast Emily Browning (Babydoll); Abbie Cornish (Sweet Pea); Jena Malone (Rocket); Vanessa Hudgens (Blondie); Jamie Chung (Amber); Oscar Isaac (Blue); Carla Gugino (Madam Gorski); Scott Glenn (Wise Man); Jon Hamm (High Roller)Credits Directed by Zack Snyder; written by Snyder and Steve Shibuya; produced by Zack Snyder and Deborah Snyder.

"Sucker Punch Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Zack SnyderMovie Review Sucker PunchZack Snyder puts visual zing into a tale of violation and revenge that is as empowering as it is controversial.March 25 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Emily Browning in her guise as Babydoll in ""Sucker Punch."" (Warner Bros. )""Sucker Punch"" Zack Snyders violent mash-up of Dickensian dark morality with Moulin Rouge couture is stun-gun gorgeous psychosexually unnerving fantasy action-riffic and most definitely not for the faint of heart. Starring the pretty pout of Emily Brownings Babydoll a sporting machine guns Mary Janes black stockings and little else a the film is existentially speaking a Freudian nightmare gunning for debate as much as entertainment. Some will see the worst sort of objectification in its Victorias Secret-esque femme front line that also includes the scantily clad corps of Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung. Others will argue that ""Sucker Punchs"" sexy guerrillas represent female empowerment to say nothing of the benefits of diet and exercise. Id suggest the film is a wonderfully wild provocation a an imperfect overlong intemperate and utterly absorbing romp through the id that I wouldnt have missed for the world. Though ""Sucker Punch"" has the fresh feel of something new the warrior princess leitmotif tracks back to Greek legend and has turned up in fiction and film ever since. The stories are sometimes cheeky in the way of Angelina Jolies sharp-shooting siren in ""Lara Croft."" Sometimes the twisted tales go darker as did Quentin Tarantinos cut in ""Kill Bill"" Vols. 1 and 2 with a brutalized and sexualized Uma Thurman. Snyder goes darker still opening ""Sucker Punch"" with a look through a rain-soaked window at why Babydolls such a mess. Her mothers death has triggered a sinister free-fall that includes a narrow escape from her lecherous stepfathers evil intentions the accidental shooting of her little sister and her immediate incarceration in a Vermont mental institution that prefers its crazies be virginal beauties. Technically the film is set in the 60s but it feels more like the 40s when lobotomies were all the rage. The blurring of reality and fantasy is there in every frame and echoes the grim storybook quality found in the graphic novel world and the fantasy look favored by gothic video games a a sort of ""Guernica"" of comic-book chaos. The vision is so precise and so specifically rendered that its not surprising that the relationship between the filmmaker and cinematographer Larry Fong started before their collaboration on ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" would establish Snyder as a filmmaking fanboy phenom (next up ""Superman""). Snyder is doing his best visual work since the arresting pen-and-ink styling of 2006s ""300"" joining one of a handful of filmmakers like Tim Burton whose deep imprint becomes a signature. He is aided and abetted by a brilliant team most of whom hes worked with before including John DesJardin (""Fantastic Four"") supervising visual effects Rick Carter (""Avatar"") handling production design and costume designer Michael Wilkinson (""Babel"") responsible for the exceptional eye-candy. There is a growing confidence apparent throughout ""Sucker Punch"" a its story conceived by Snyder and its script co-written with Steve Shibuya a that was lacking in the filmmakers too reverent adaptation of ""Watchmen"" in 2009. Even the music does a better job of layering on meaning a haunting rock-centric mix of the familiar a a particularly great rendition of ""White Rabbit"" a and the new with Marius DeVries and Tyler Bates in charge. The story exists on three levels. The first and least explored is the harsh reality of the mental institution. Next is a low-grade fantasy with Babydoll imagining that shes actually imprisoned in a brothel with the girls forced to put on a burlesque review in a swanky mens club. The third a high-grade super-octane dreamscape of battles obstacles and conquests comes when Babydoll closes her eyes and starts to dance. The extreme other worlds are the best by far with Babydoll facing off against giant samurais in one World War 1-era zombie soldiers in another and fire-breathing dragons in yet another all exquisitely imagined. By now the other pretties have joined the Babydoll resistance with Cornish (""Bright Star"") as the older-wiser and reluctant Sweet Pea; Malone (""The Messenger"" ""Bastard Out of Carolina"") as her pistol of a younger sister Rocket; ""High School Musicals"" Hudgens as a curvy brunet named Blondie; and Chung (TVs ""Samurai Girl"") as the heavy-machinery-driving Amber. Theres not much to say about the acting other than these babes in boyland are heroes one and all fearlessly showing a lot of leg as they kick shoot and slash their way toward an uncertain victory.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSix lessons from Man of Steels successJune 17 2013Review Post Tenebras Lux a lyrical exploration of dark...June 7 2013Steven Spielbergs James Bond ... and other near-missesNovember 29 2012Movie review Henry Cavill is mighty in ImmortalsNovember 11 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTZack SnyderCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-sucker-punch-20110325,0,7702288.story",200,suckerpunch29,suckerpunch,latimes

A field day for schoolgirl fetishists and fanboys with a penchant for steampunk (but with Snyders leaden dialogue youve got to call it steamclunk) this staggering failure borrows from Baz Luhrmanns Moulin Rouge Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunets The City of Lost Children Quentin Tarantinos Kill Bill and a variety of psych-ward melodramas from The Snake Pit to The Uninvited.If that sounds like itd make for a cool mash-up maybe it would have - if Snyder had anything on his mind apart from exploding zeppelins fire-breathing dragons Japanese samurai fights and Carla Gugino doing a campy Polish accent. One of the creepier aspects of the plot - if you can call this ricocheting pastiche a plot - is that Baby Doll (Emily Browning) the sorry lass who has been committed to Lennox House for the Mentally Insane by her sleazeball stepdad is set to have a frontal lobotomy.Talk about apt metaphors Its nothing but brain-dead delirium on screen.OK if youre a 15-year-old boy (or a 30-year-old boy or a girl with a 50s pinup jones) theres no denying that the girl-gang casting of Sucker Punch - pouty pigtailed Browning; the regal Nicole Kidman-esque Abbie Cornish; punky Jena Malone; plucky Vanessa Hudgens and the exotic Jamie Chung - has a certain allure. But even with the strip-club fantasy costumes and the drop-downs into video gamelike alternate universes the eye candy quickly gets stale.Baby Doll is sent to this gothic hilltop asylum where she shares a ward with the aforementioned inmates named Sweet Pea Rocket Blondie and Amber. Oscar Isaac is Blue Lennox Houses sinister overseer. One way to keep track of which reality Baby Doll finds herself in is to watch Isaacs face If hes got a thin mustache going and hes in shark skin its the nightclub/bordello reality. If hes clean-shaven in a white caretakers jacket its the ""normal"" world.Gugino (Snyders muse She was in Watchmen too) likewise changes appearance. Shes Lennox Houses empathetic psychiatrist counseling her patients in a comfy office on one plane of reality; shes a madam-cum-Method acting coach leading her leggy troupers through various elaborate scenarios on another.Sucker Punch in case this hasnt been made clear toggles back and forth to and fro between alternating mindscapes as Baby Doll and her team embark on an epic scavenger hunt. They need to find a map then fire then a knife and then a key.""The fifth thing is a mystery"" intones Scott Glenn playing a kind of Zen master who seems to have boned up on his riddle-me-this delivery by watching episodes of David Carradines Kung Fu.""Begin your journey"" he tells Baby Doll. ""It will set you free.""Exit the theater. It will set you freer.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Sucker Punch bears the unmistakable mark of hyper-auteur Zack Snyder but it could just as easily have been willed into existence by the collective geekocracy. Its as if the filmmakers took a poll at Comic-Con of all the elements attendees seek in a movie--starlets in skimpy outfits adept at hand-to-hand combat; Nazi robot monsters; elaborate fantasy worlds; a wise mentor figure who adopts many forms; cabaret-style covers of New Wave hits; and why not throw in Don Draper while youre at it?--then combined them all in the ultimate fanboy mash-up. Snyder has described it as ""Alice In Wonderland with machine guns"" but its more like The Pussycat Dolls Present Steampunk Kill Bill only more assaultive and pandering than that description suggests. Emily Browning leads a cast of young actresses as a hard-luck orphan in some alternate universe 1950s where life would have to improve immeasurably just to qualify as Dickensian. A gauntlet of formative traumas lands Browning in a gothic mental hospital and then in a nightmarish cabaret/brothel. She regularly escapes the drudgery by entering into an elaborate fantasy world where she and her fellow kept/abused women do battle with Nazi mechanical men dragons and various other beasties with the sagacious counsel of shape-shifting mentor Scott Glenn. CGI has made it so easy to create fantastical worlds out of computers and imagination that a film can offer a never-ending parade of eye-popping images and larger-than-life setpieces and still feel dull. Sucker Punch offers the same combination of overpowering style and nonexistent substance as Snyders earlier 300 along with a depressingly black-and-white worldview that splits humanity into vessels of pure good and exemplars of unspeakable evil. Only this time Snyder is pandering to the Barely Legal demographic rather than trafficking in over-the-top homoeroticism. Browning has wildly expressive eyes and body language but she turns wooden when delivering Snyder and Steve Shibuyas alternately purple and stilted banter. Like the film she seems to regard plot and dialogue as necessary evils. With its quests to retrieve magical totems clearly demarcated levels and non-stop action Snyders clattering concoction sometimes feels less like a movie than an extended elaborate trailer for its redundant videogame adaptation.
