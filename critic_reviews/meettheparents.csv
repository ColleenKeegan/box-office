Comments Meet the Parents This remake of a 1991 comedy pits Ben Stiller a nurse against Robert De Niro his girlfriends father in whose eyes he can do no right. They meet for the first time when a family wedding brings the couple to New York for an anticlimactic weekend of catastrophes. Scenes that should have been uproarious are weaker than many of the movies smaller moments whose everyday humor--much of it about the annoyances of air travel--isnt specific to the plot or characters. Jay Roach (the ""Austin Powers"" series) directed a screenplay by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg; with Teri Polo and Blythe Danner. 107 min.

Robert De Niro welcomes his daughters boyfriend (Ben Stiller) in ""Meet the Parents. `Meet the Parents and Say Hello to Disaster / De Niro delicious in role of the impossible dad 1 / 1 Back to Gallery MEET THE PARENTS Comedy. Starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. Directed by Jay Roach. (Rated PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller give the comedy of disaster a nice little workout in ""Meet the Parents."" When Daddys little girl brings her boyfriend home to visit Stiller is the schlemiel boyfriend and De Niro is Dad. Overprotective doesnt begin to describe him and paranoid probably goes too far. What De Niro does with the role is something else. Hes a subtle martinet. ""My way or the Long Island Expressway"" he says beaming. Another actor might have mugged stomped spit and steamed from the ears. De Niro plays the suspicious father -- who has a secret life of his own -- for nuance. Hes gimlet-eyed. He broods. He throws little sidelong glances. His moods range from a pained smile to tight-lipped disgust. In ""Meet the Parents"" disasters are just waiting to happen and it may be a good idea to keep an eye on --The urn. --The cat. --The cigarettes. --The volleyball. Among other things. Sometimes disaster may be the best thing that can happen to a person. Look at it this way It cant get any worse. The universe gives you its best shot youre still standing. Greg Focker should know. As played by Stiller Greg watches with an increasingly stoic gaze as the escalating series of disasters piles up around him in this suburban manifestation of the American dream. Greg a soulful Chicago nurse has been brought home to Long Island by his girlfriend Pam for her sisters wedding. Hell get more than a once-over from the parents. ""Be nice to this one OK?"" Pam tells Dad. Greg plays right in to Dads peculiar combination of implacable convictions and absolute cluelessness. Dad thinks smoking is a sign of weakness. He loves cats (dogs are emotionally shallow) and has a prize Abyssinian. He cant stand to lose. He loves the song ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" but is shocked when Greg tells him what its really about. Hes suspicious of among many other things nurses at least the male variety. ""Not many men in your profession are there?"" he inquires. His other daughter is going to marry a doctor. Its only one of the class distinctions thrown in Gregs face. Pams IPO-profiteering ex-boyfriend lives in rustic splendor. Religious differences are just under the surface. As Mom Blythe Danner even with a sunny off-center look that makes her seem slightly daffy has an upper-class WASP vibe. Dad has a sanctimonious regard for an urn of his mothers ashes on the mantel. Greg is Jewish and the ex-boyfriend is a Jesus freak. Dad has written a poem to his late mother and De Niro gives it quite a reading. It may be doggerel but De Niro does not do the obvious and go for the cheap laugh. There is another subtle comic performance by Owen Wilson (""Shanghai Noon"") as the offhand overachieving ex-boyfriend. Wilson adroitly ducks every opportunity to overdo it. One problem with ""Meet the Parents"" is that after all the disasters are done the movie has nowhere to go. No problem. Amy Hohn as a punctilious airline ticket agent steps in and saves the day. Pam is played by Teri Polo who doesnt have nearly enough to do. She has insisted that Greg not tell her dad they live together and he bunks out in the parlor. In a adjoining cubbyhole Dad keeps an old- fashioned lie detector and there are hidden video cameras scattered around. Its a kind of ""sex lies and videotape"" in suburbia. -- Advisory This film contains racy humor. ..

The ticket-buying audience is getting younger. Studio bean counters prefer reinvesting in the familiar to gambling on the new. In trying to guess why Hollywood is producing so few satisfying modern-day mainstream comedies not pegged to the recognizable antics of big-budget stars like Jim Carrey or Eddie Murphy Im probably overlooking the obvious Making a funny but not mean smart but not smug broad but not lazy ensemble comedy about contemporary people in a realistic setting is hard. For which Meet the Parents is to be commended -- its a bouncy loose-limbed families-do-the-darnedest-things sitcom that elicits ungrudging laughs without invoking water boys pet detectives or Klumps. The premise is simple streamlined a direct descendant of a hundred society-affirming all-in-the-family romps from Father of the Bride to Betsys Wedding A would-be groom spends a weekend at the swanky home of his formidable prospective in-laws and in his nervousness he nearly wrecks the place as well as his chances of wedding their precious daughter. The casting is inspired leading with Ben Stiller as the marriage-minded young man and Robert De Niro as the paterfamilias. (Can you think of a more terrifying father-in-law?) Director Jay Roach who orchestrated mod mayhem in his two Austin Powers hits is no Frank Capra Woody Allen or Todd Solondz (to mention three wildly different stylizers of American family life); his movie is as standardly wrapped and sometimes as unwieldy as an armful of wedding presents. But at least Roach brings gifts to the party. He unwraps them only after getting the ceremonies off to a bumpy start. In the dismaying opening scene a doctor appears to be proposing marriage to his sweetheart on her sickbed. The camera pulls in close on Stillers face -- a sign of course that this medic is no angel. (Like his fellow ironist Greg Kinnear Stillers got a handsome mug that mimes ""You may be right; I may be a schmuck."") Then the camera pulls back. The man in the surgical scrubs (his vaguely rude name is Greg Focker) turns out to be practicing his proposal speech on a toothless old hospital patient. Greg is also fiddling with a length of catheter tubing to the bedridden mans intense penile discomfort. And Greg announces hes really not a doctor. Hes a nurse. Genital reference and gender stereotyping ha-ha After that though Parents finds its own comfortable rhythm. Working from an unforced conversational script by Jim Herzfeld (Its Garry Shandlings Show) and John Hamburg (Safe Men) Roach allows his thoroughbred cast room to prance without letting them run wild. This is another light project in which De Niro plays for laughs off his well-earned fame as a volatile heavy and its his best comic star turn yet; the novelty-act self-consciousness he brought to Wag the Dog and the antic intensity with which he parodied his own wiseguy image in Analyze This has burned off. And relaxed hes even funnier. When as protective daddy Jack Byrnes he appraises the character of the man who wants to marry his adored little girl Pam (cottony-soft Teri Polo from TVs Felicity) De Niro lets simple glances do the work and Roach lets the actor take his time drawing out the deadpan hilarity.

"Meet the Parents | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; meet-the-parents ) Meet the Parents (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli What has happened to Robert De Niros career? Once referred to as one of the top working American actors De Niro has seen his talents wasted countless times in recent years as he has chosen one bad project after another. The list of titles reads like a litany of mediocrity The Fan Great Expectations Flawless The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle Men of Honor and Meet the Parents. There have been a few entertaining efforts mixed in like Ronin and Analyze This but one has to go back to the mid-1990s and Casino to find the last time that De Niro truly lit up the screen. Like Analyze This Meet the Parents plays off De Niros intimidating reputation as a psycho/gangster/all-around badass. Here he portrays the living embodiment of every guys nightmare the girlfriends father. The role certainly doesnt make undue demands of De Niro. By playing things straight he milks the greatest comic potential out of an uneven screenplay. (Remember the straight man doesnt get the laughs but the jokes dont work without him.) In Analyze This De Niro proved beyond any doubt that he can be as adept at comedy as at drama and theres nothing in Meet the Parents to challenge that conclusion. Unfortunately the movie as a whole doesnt live up to its top-billed actors performance. Meet the Parents is put together like a TV sit-com. Director Jay Roach the man behind the camera for the two Austin Powers spoofs (as well as Mystery Alaska) strings together a series of hit-and-miss lowbrow gags with little care for whether any of the connecting material is coherent interesting or enjoyable (in most cases its none of those three). When its funny Meet the Parents can be very funny; however there are often long stretches of filler in between the laughs. How well the film works for each individual will depend on his or her tolerance for this sort of marginal approach. Typecast Ben Stiller plays a meek guy who becomes the butt of the universes latest cosmic joke. Bearing the unlikely moniker of Gaylord Greg Focker (say the last name out loud then imagine the mileage the script gets from it) Stillers male nurse is madly in love with school teacher Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to marry her but decides to get Dads permission first. So he accompanies Pam when she goes home to participate in her sisters wedding. Pams mother Dina (Blythe Danner) tries her best to make Greg feel at home but Jack (De Niro) makes him nervous. A series of misadventures ensues including one involving a potty-trained cat and an urn containing Jacks beloved mothers ashes leading to an incident where Greg is strapped to a polygraph machine while Jack grills him about his intentions towards Pam. (This is a slightly more intense version of the typical father/boyfriend heart-to-heart chat.) And thats only the beginning - like in the Chevy Chase Vacation pictures the disasters keep coming each progressively worse than the last one. The movie is not nearly as engaging as Stillers best known effort to date Theres Something About Mary. The comedy here seems less spontaneous and more obviously scripted and consequently not as riotous. Plus while there was genuine chemistry between Stiller and Cameron Diaz in the Farrelly Brothers film the relationship between Greg and Pam in Meet the Parents lacks romantic credibility. These two dont click. I might buy them as brother and sister but as lovers? Veterans De Niro and Danner connect more believably. Meet the Parents is not a terrible film - there are enough amusing moments to keep things from becoming tedious - but it lacks a few of the key ingredients (like comic momentum) that would have made it a consistently entertaining endeavor. Much like the aforementioned Vacation films this one proceeds according to a formula allowing nothing to deter it from its preordained trajectory. Unfortunately there are times when being on such a rigidly constrained track smothers the potential for off-the-wall comedy (Im sure the desire to obtain a ""PG-13"" rating had something to do with that as well). The only chances Meet the Parents takes are safe chances. During a scene when the septic tank backs up I laughed because it was funny in a gross way not because it was daring. With a lesser known cast using the same screenplay this might have been headed directly to the Blockbuster near you.

This review was corrected on Oct. 1 2000. Expand to feature length the classic sequence in ""Annie Hall"" in which Woody Allen visits Diane Keatons weird Wisconsin family and you have ""Meet the Parents"" a flat-out hilarious mainstream comedy. For a major studio film you might have to go back to ""Theres Something About Mary"" to surpass the number of yucks triggered by this broad but not dumbed-down Universal/DreamWorks co-venture. With audiences so bereft of anything remotely satisfying of late this adult-slanted but universally accessible Oct. 6 release will be a tonic at the B.O. through the fall season. Widening his range from the gag-oriented antics of the two ""Austin Powers"" installments director Jay Roach reveals a talent for more character-centered work here while also demonstrating outstanding timing and the ability to sustain a comic narrative at feature length. Of course it helps to have a clever script that continues to wring surprises from a simple basic premise as well as actors like Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller who can milk their characters growing mutual animosity for all its worth. The history of comedy is loaded with stories of earnest young men who need to prove their worth to prospective wives or parents-in-law. ""Meet the Parents"" actually has its genesis in one of them a short film by comedian Greg Glienna who shares story credit with Mary Ruth Clarke. In the yarn as developed by scripters Jim Herzfeld (""Meet the Deedles"" ""Tapeheads"") and John Hamburg (""Safe Men"") Greg Focker (Stiller) systematically proves hes not worthy to wed the lovely Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) with the latters intimidating CIA vet father Jack (De Niro) giving the young man all the rope he needs to hang himself. Pic pivots on a clash of cultures and class that is rigged against the interloper from the outset and the accumulation of disasters and humiliations instigated and suffered by the sincere suitor is accompanied by a direct escalation in hilarity. The laughs start even with the joint studio logos as Randy Newmans song ""A Fool in Love"" comments wittily on their respective motifs before Chicago elementary school teacher Pam takes her male hospital nurse b.f. Greg to Long Island to meet her folks for the first time. Occasion is the abruptly announced marriage of her sister Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) although Greg plans to use the trip to propose to Pam who has evidently taken several previous gentlemen home in the past. Although Pams mom Dina (Blythe Danner) is as outwardly warm and welcoming as her dad is imposing and overbearing the whole package is threatening to the well-intentioned Greg The Byrneses are polished and poised while hes grubby and shuffling; theyre accomplished and well off while he unambitiously stopped short of becoming a doctor; theyre old guard while hes a wannabe; and not incidentally theyre WASPs while hes Jewish. The religious distinction is only made once in an uproarious scene in which at their first dinner together Dad asks Greg to say grace and the latter caught utterly off guard sputters along until finally lapsing into banal lyrics from the ""Godspell"" song ""Day by Day."" But the fact that Gregs religion is specified adds an unexpected dimension It not only sparks extra belly laughs as when Pams Mr. Perfect ex-b.f. (Owen Wilson) explains that he took up carpentry because he considers Jesus an excellent role model but places ""Meet the Parents"" explicitly in the context of the literature of the outsider Jew up against the WASP establishment; Philip Roth fans take note. Initially deferential and self-emasculating in the face of Jacks firmly expressed opinions and authoritative manner Focker whose name his hosts pronounce with assorted lewd variations during the course of the weekend digs himself into an impossible hole by shooting a champagne cork straight at the urn holding the remains of Jacks beloved mother sending the ashes crashing to the floor and providing Jacks equally adored Himalayan cat a new source of Kitty Litter. After Jack makes Greg take a latenight polygraph test ""just for fun"" Pam reveals that dad actually isnt in the flower business as alleged but has spent 34 years in psychological profiling with the CIA. ""Hes a human lie detector"" she says letting Greg know that hes not going to be able to put anything over on her father. Disaster piles upon disaster as Greg is effortlessly put in his place by Debbies medically eminent father and fiance injures the bride-to-be in a fiercely competitive water volleyball game floods the backyard wedding site with sewage by flushing a toilet hes been told not to touch lets Jacks precious cat outside and nearly destroys the house trying to retrieve it. Greg is finally kicked out of the house an hour into the picture leaving the young man to wonder if he really is as big a schnook as hes seemed for the past two days and Jack to decide whether hes an impossibly overprotective father. Having definitively established his credentials as a comic actor (and marked a B.O. high) in ""Analyze This"" last year De Niro hits the bulls eye here as a cagey and quirky hardcase who lets nothing slip through his naturally suspicious mind and sets fatal mindgame traps for ""opponents"" such as Greg as a matter of course. Although De Niro is not the first actor that comes to mind to play a WASPy patriarch actor socks over his characterization of military man with an unerring b.s. detector via an amazing array of condescending and critical facial expressions and twists of phrase. On more familiar ground is Stiller whose performance constitutes a virtual catalog of the varieties of shmuckdom and consequent embarrassment. Thesp puts across his numerous physical comedy scenes in good fashion and has his big moment in an airport scene where returning to Chicago with his tail between his legs hes humiliated to the breaking point by a schoolmarmish attendant (Kali Rocha). Polo (a regular on TVs ""Felicity"") is winsomely energetic as the young lady at the center of the tug-of-war Danner straightforwardly conveys suburban comfort and strong spousal support and Owen Wilson keenly underplays the Aryan-American god with whom Pam previously shared an outstanding physical relationship much to Gregs consternation. Only spot where script misses a beat is in the character of Pams pothead brother who serves a minimal function and seems like a chip off the ""American Beauty"" block of father-dominated weirdos. Directed by Roach with real comic verve and alertness to the humorous possibilities in every situation pic verily races along without ever seeming forced or losing steam. Craft contributions are spot-on down the line. Read Varietys review of Greg Gliennas original 1992 film.

(Phillip V. Caruso/Universal) The bottom line of any comedy has got to be Is it funny? I mean if people are laughing its a no-brainer right? So lets ignore the fact that ""Meet the Parents"" wont be cited in film classes around the country as one of the great comedies. Lets overlook its vision of WASPness which would be grounds for defamation if white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were an officially protected species. And lets just forget that this movie is distributed by Universal the most shameless purveyor of bad comedy in the Hollywood Hills. (Hey making both Flintstones movies is enough alone to merit this sweeping statement.) Because people are laughing. Or they will be. How could they not with Ben Stiller squeezing himself into a Speedo? Or Robert De Niro as a bullet-head dad who trains his kitty to use the can? ""Meet the Parents"" which began as a short film by comedian-director Greg Glienna has one provocative premise What if you visited your girlfriends parents for the first time only to come face to face with Travis Bickle? In other words Robert De Niro at his toughest. In this comedy as Jack Byrnes hes former CIA with a specialty in psychological profiling. And Jack loves his daughter see. Which is why he favors lie detector tests over polite conversation when it comes to checking out his little girls suitors. Male nurse Greg (Stiller) whos in love with Jacks daughter Pam (Teri Polo) has his work cut out for him. But when he hears that Jack has just allowed a suitor to marry his other daughter because the guy asked his permission Greg decides to make nice with the father-in-law from hell. ""Not many men in your profession huh Greg?"" asks Jack with that tight-lipped De Niro grimace. Its not a good start. But Greg is determined to keep trying - and thats what powers the movie. Hyper-sensitive Greg whos painfully aware that hes a Jew imprisoned in a Norman Rockwell home is so hot-wired to please that he messes up everything. Agreeing to say grace at the dinner table for instance is definitely a bad idea. But Greg gamely tries. ""Oh Dear God"" he begins. ""You are such a good God . . ."" And so on. The situation is clear. Director Jay Roach (who did both ""Austin Powers"" movies) knows his sight gags. One of the best involves the aforementioned Speedo which Greg has to borrow for the swimming pool when the airline temporarily loses his luggage. Roach also knows to play to the movies twin strengths Stiller and De Niro. Throw these guys together turn up the intensity. Stillers absolute discomfort as Greg is essential. That tension tweaks everything. At the dinner table (again) Jack reads a tortured confessional love poem dedicated to his late mother and her fatal bout with cancer. When he concludes Greg is forced to make some sort of polite comment. ""Amazing"" he begins as the Byrneses stare at him. ""So much love yet also so much information."" Speaking of too much information youll have to hear the rest of the jokes for yourself. MEET THE PARENTS (PG-13 108 minutes) - Contains strong language sexual situations and drug themes.
