(Sam Emerson) B The Last Song Starring Miley Cyrus Greg Kinnear; Director Julie Anne Robinson; Author Nicholas Sparks (Author) Jeff Van Wie; Release Date Wide 04/02/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 108; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted March 31 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT If you know anything in advance about The Last Song you know that it stars Miley Cyrus. You also probably have an opinion about her. She is after all the formidably successful teen Disney Channel hatchling who heads a global pop culture empire that now stretches from Hannah Montana mania to a line of Walmart clothing. But in order to get the most out of The Last Song its best to tune out your awareness of Cyrus celebrity. Or the fact that this mild girl-oriented tearjerker has been written specifically for the young star to expand her thespian range in a story machine-welded by indefatigable best-seller churner Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook) and coscreenwriter Jeff Van Wie. So forget all that. Just know that The Last Song stars a dark-haired up-and-comer in the role of a sullen teenage girl named Ronnie. Ronnie and her kid brother have come from New York City to spend a summer in an atmospheric Southern beach town with their divorced father. (Likable-dad player Greg Kinnear plays Dad.) Ronnies relationship with her father is pretty awful but their communication gets better after she meets a nice cute guy named Will (Liam Hemsworth) whose niceness makes Ronnie nicer too. And thats good because before this melodrama comes to its sand-and-surf conclusion Ronnie Dad Will and just about every single resident of this atmospheric Southern beach town will experience character-building challenges and heartrending sadnesses. These are guaranteed to result in tears for the sad fictional people on screen as well as for the satisfied real people watching in movie theaters. And heres the revelation Miley Cyrus is a really interesting movie star in the making with an intriguing echo-of-foghorn speaking voice and a scuffed-up tomboyish physicality (in the Kristen Stewart mode) that sets her apart from daintier girls in her celebrity class. As Ronnie turning moods on a dime the way girls her age do Cyrus sustains a perfectly believable demonstration of post-high-school precollege female longing. She shows anger vulnerability defensiveness. And she anchors a serviceable idealized drama about how a loving relationship between a father and daughter paves the way for that lucky daughter to one day find adult love.

You know the drill boy meets girl while we wonder whos going to die. But while Dear John had capable charismatic leads The Last Song stars a guy from Neighbours (Liam Hemsworth) and Hannah Montana (aka Miley Cyrus). Hemsworth is not so bad but Cyrus doesnt convince believing a toothy pout is a catch-all for any emotion but happiness. And her character pouts a lot teenage Ronnie is sulking with her father (Greg Kinnear) while spending a summer at his beachhouse. Her parents have split so shes wearing a lot of black but she starts brushing her hair when local hunk Will (Hemsworth) comes on the scene. As a chaste romance ensues things are enlivened by 13-year-old Bobby Coleman as Ronnies brother a cute characterful kid hes the one wholl get you laughing and blubbing. Anyone but Cyrus fans will find this one of the more inferior Sparks adaptations - and yes that includes Nights in Rodanthe.

"The Last Song One long tedious weeper | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Last Song One long tedious weeperMiley Cyrus is all growed up no longer content to warble youth-empowering pop songs as teen idol Hannah Montana to fatten the coffers of Disney Corp.Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth in a scene from Last Song.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraStaff ReporterTues. March 30 2010 The Last Song (out of 4) At major theatres. PG Miley Cyrus is all growed up no longer content to warble youth-empowering pop songs as teen idol Hannah Montana to fatten the coffers of Disney Corp.Yup shes grown up enough to play Ronnie Miller a sullen vegan woman-child forced to spend the summer with her estranged dad at his oceanfront home in Georgia with little brother in tow.Article Continued BelowThere she meets a gorgeous guy named Will whom -- natch -- she initially rejects befriends a girl who betrays her and later repents and becomes mother hen to a clutch of unhatched sea turtle eggs.Predictably over the course of the summer her mood -- like her wardrobe -- gradually morphs from black to happier shades her scowl replaced by a toothy smile.Fans hoping to hear Cyrus break into song are sure to be disappointed. She only briefly accompanies a tune on the radio at which point her boyfriend comments on how fabulous her voice is. (The BF is clearly trying to get to first base.)The ""Last Song"" of the title is not particularly stirring or memorable composed by Dad who is (spoiler alert . . . oops sorry . . . too late) dying of cancer.Its yet another adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks weeper littered with weighty prognostications on love. To wit ""Loves not always enough"" ""Love is fragile and were not always its best caretakers"" and ""Love is like a box of chocolates for people with severe lactose intolerance."" (One of those three is a fake quote. Guess which one.)There isnt a whiff of Macon County Line menace in the idyllic Georgia setting and thats kind of a shame if only because the film is so woefully short of dramatic tension.For instance will dad (played by Greg Kinnear who has the saddest eyes in showbiz) and Ronnie reconcile? Oh yes. Will the mystery of who really burned down the church be revealed? Again yes. Will the stained-glass window dads making to replace the one destroyed in the fire he thinks he set by accident be ready in time? Yes dammit yes enough already.All of which pretty much sums up the film kinda-yeah-like-okay-I-guess-whatever.Cyrus has a passable screen presence and newcomer Liam Hemsworth improbably tall with a couple of well-trimmed birds nest for eyebrows that accentuate his dreamy blue eyes is appealing enough to land his fill of future dreamboat roles.Their deep stares lingering (no-tongue) kisses and chaste embraces will reassure skittish parents and ensure a safe all-family rating. Plus their off-screen romance will help fuel what is certain to be a healthy box-office haul.But sadly without a single note of originality Last Song is an awfully long and tiresome tune.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Warner Bros. By Joe Morgenstern Updated April 2 2010 1201 a.m. ET A few more 3-D spectacles like ""Clash of the Titans"" and audiences will be clamoring for 2-D. Whats wrong with this sad fiasco goes far beyond its visual deficits but lets start there. The film a remake of a 1981 action fantasy loosely based on Greek mythology was shot with conventional cameras then hastily reprocessed into an approximation of 3-D in the wake of the stunning success of ""Avatar."" The result is 2.5-D a murkily virtual virtuality. You get an ambiguous sense of depth at a steep price that includes but isnt confined to the box-office surcharge that the studios have begun to impose on such attractions in a sudden frenzy of delusion and greed. Watch a clip from ""Clash of the Titans"" a remake of the cult classic featuring giant scorpions harpies blind witches Greek Goods and Liam Neeson in a shiny suit of armor. Video courtesy of Warner Bros. First of all the glasses you use to watch this production sit heavily on the nose--their so-called active-shutter technology involves built-in electronics--and they soak up so much light that day scenes turn into an unintended twilight of the gods while night scenes look as if someone forgot to light the set. Figures in the foreground range from partially modeled to inexplicably flat while computer-generated effects are occasionally impressive (the beheading of Medusa) but mostly indifferent (a big gold coin thats scaled out over the audience doesnt make it past the first few rows). Whats more the visual murk creates emotional murk; the experience is such a downer that its hard to find moments of up. Now living in a democracy means youre free to take the glasses off at any time without fear of retribution from Warner Bros. or the exhibitors. (Youre also free to choose a theater thats showing a 2-D version.) I removed mine after 40 minutes and discovered that the images on the screen were not only bright but reasonably sharp so the glasses stayed in my lap for the duration. Yet bright images cant sustain the illusion of life without drama and in that respect ""Clash of the Titans"" which was directed by Louis Letterier is strictly no-D. Sam Worthington--most recently and multidimensionally of ""Avatar""--is Perseus born of a god but raised as a man and pretty much played as a block of wood. ""I dont know why I was born or what I am"" he laments at one point and you can relate since the movie doesnt know what to do with him. Hes sent on endless battles to defeat Hades (Ralph Fiennes whispering and simpering) before that misshapen wretch can seize power from his fatuous brother Zeus (Liam Neeson squirming and declaiming) and turn the earth into a living hell. Having established Perseus as a fearless hunk however the misshapen script wont give him a girl to love. Hes got a beautiful guide in Gemma Artertons Io; she turns up every now and then to say do this dont do that or go this way instead of that way. Yet theres no chemistry between them because chemistry requires proximity and Io seems to be operating on some ethereal plane. (Though she could be just another victim of the disorienting photography.) And in a masterstroke of dramatic perversity Io is given to Perseus--as a gift from the gods--just before the movie ends. Presumably hell enjoy her but we dont get to watch. ENLARGE Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus in The Last Song. Touchstone Pictures The Last Song Disney has a lot riding on ""The Last Song"" a romantic tale that brings Miley Cyrus out of her preteen--and immensely profitable--Hannah Montana phase into the role of an amorous teenage girl. Many of the early reviews have heaped scorn on the film some aspects of which invite it. For one thing this is second-tier melodrama from Nicholas Sparks deaths favorite franchisee so the cliches come moist and shameless. For another Ms. Cyruss Ronnie Miller a piano prodigy living in New York with her mother and little brother must get through lots of anger at having to spend a summer in coastal Georgia with her estranged father whos played by Greg Kinnear. Thats a really bad idea. The young star doesnt yet have the skill to play anger interestingly and the director Julie Anne Robinson hasnt helped matters by keeping the camera on her face during tight-jawed glowers that sometimes stay fixed for the full length of a scene. Speakeasy The Last Song Tests Miley Cyrus Nicholas Sparks Box Office Appeal Nevertheless and at the risk of inviting scorn too I must say that ""The Last Song"" takes a sharp turn for the better when Ronnie and a poor big rich boy played by Liam Hemsworth fall in love. Hes handsome and charming while she becomes sweet and endearing. ""Youre not like other girls"" he tells her; its believable because she believes it. Some of the sappiness must be seen to be believed--a clumsy subplot involving violence and arson an ecologically correct salute to cute sea turtle hatchlings. But the movie moves Ms. Cyrus from where she was to more or less where she and her handlers wanted to be and Mr. Kinnears musician father Steve adds a generous measure of grace. Instead of telling Ronnie that shes not like other girls Steve tells her with genuine poignancy that she doesnt yet know who she is. Its an expression of faith that shell soon find out and that the discovery will delight her. The Secret of Kells ENLARGE A scene from The Secret of Kells. GKIDS From our vantage point--or disadvantage point--in time its impossible to project ourselves into the minds of the medieval monks who created the Book of Kells the magnificently illuminated manuscript that spent centuries at the Abbey of Kells and can currently be seen and studied at the Trinity College Library in Dublin. Were they performing an act of pure devotion or pursuing beauty as well? Theres no mystery though about why the people who made ""The Secret of Kells"" did what they did. This wonderfully strange and exquisite little feature was created especially for young children to celebrate the book through another kind of illumination thats been falling into disuse--hand-drawn animation. The story concerns a Celtic boy named Brendan who helps a master illuminator finish the book then protects it from Viking marauders. (The director was Tomm Moore and the co-director was Nora Twomey.) But the soul of the film lies in its ravishing colors and in exuberantly stylized images that pay homage to Celtic culture and design together with techniques and motifs that evoke Matisse Miyazaki and the minimalist cartoons of UPA. Since the emphasis is more on graphic variety than continuity theres almost a sense of too-muchness but thats fine; its another expression of devotion. Find related television listings at LocateTV. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE In Bruges (2008) Ralph Fiennes is the scarily explosive boss of two hit men played by Brendan Gleeson (who voiced Abbot Cellach in ""The Secret of Kells"") and Colin Farrell. He sends them to Bruges with instructions to wait--not for Godot though theres a bit of that feeling but for further instructions about who gets killed next. The violence can be shocking but Martin McDonaghs film is also very funny and a morality play thats deeply affecting. Jordan Prentice is a racist dwarf and Clemence Poesy plays Chloe a woman who is not but also is the person she seems to be. ENLARGE Little Miss Sunshine (2006) A dysfunctional-family comedy with a difference--the function progresses from dys to full and loving. Seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) wants to compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine in the California contest of the same name. To do so however she must mobilize her family a quarrelsome but entertaining group of depressives. Greg Kinnear is Olives father Richard a motivational speaker whose own will to win is following his career down the drain. The cast includes Toni Collette Steve Carell and Alan Arkin. Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris directed from an original screenplay by Michael Arndt. ENLARGE The Triplets of Belleville (2003) One viewing isnt enough to take in the eccentric pleasures of Sylvain Chomets animated feature. (Two of its producers Didier Brunner and Viviane Vanfleteren served in similar capacities on ""The Secret of Kells."")

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Last Song amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Antarctic Chronicles Clash of the Titans >> The Last Song In Hannah Montana The Movie Hannah Montana/Miley Stewart/Miley Cyrus throws herself a banging bubblegum beach party. Here she skulks through one shoulders hunched nose ring glinting combat boots laced to kill. And the bikini teens who venerate her other lives sneer. If you trust the tabloids this punk Miley may be the closest to her own personality. Certainly she had a hand in creating her when Disney gave her a Hannah-free breakout feature simply slated ""Untitled Miley Cyrus Project"" she said she wanted to do one of novelist Nicholas Sparks doomed big romances. Trouble was he was fresh out of books. So the Mouse strong-armed him into cranking out another and the rush job result is a Frankenstein of Sparks cliches. Miley plays a piano prodigy who abandoned the ivories when her parents divorced. Forced to spend the summer with her estranged dad (Greg Kinnear) and brother (Bobby Coleman) shes immediately and inexplicably latched onto by Sparks most stalkerish dreamboat a Vanderbilt-accepted mechanic environmentalist and volleyball champ (Liam Hemsworth). For 30 minutes theyre grating. The stretch where they fall in love is a music video. But for 10 minutes their romance--and the film--blooms and deepens before the merciless tear factory starts cranking. This is Mileys vehicle but the strongest scenes are between Kinnear and Coleman. Their father-son bond deserves its own movie free from the heavy-handed play-it-safe gloss the studio has glommed onto its prize teen even as she struggles to rebel.

As a talented pianist who resentfully leaves New York to visit her divorced dad (Greg Kinnear) in his southern coastal small town Cyrus alternates between surliness and sarcasm before tumbling for a local teen heartthrob; at that point shes supposed to glow but she fails to engage noticeably with the other actors. Director Julie Anne Robinson making her feature debut must have been chosen for her malleability because theres nothing distinguished about her work here. With Kelly Preston.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Dont think of ""The Last Song"" as a Miley Cyrus movie. Think of it as a Nicholas Sparks chick flick. Hes the novelist/screenwriter who has given us ""The Notebook"" and ""Dear John"" among others. So you wont be surprised that ""The Last Song"" written expressly for Miley features young love divorce a terminal illness reconciliation and a wedding. In other words this movie is so sentimental that youll need a hanky -- or a package of Kleenex if youre a teen girl. Teen girls are the target audience for ""The Last Song"" because they grew up with its star Miley Cyrus on Disney Channels ""Hannah Montana"" and they like seeing shirtless stud muffins playing beach volleyball. Theyll dig the story lines too involving a just-graduated-from-high-school girls relationships with a dreamy boy who has depth a distant dad who is artistic and witty and a little brother who is helpful and lovable. Ronnie (Cyrus) and Jonah (Bobby Coleman) are driven by their mom (Kelly Preston) from New York to spend the summer at their dads rustic-chic cabin on a ritzy island off Georgia. Ronnie a piano prodigy has never forgiven her composer dad (Greg Kinnear) for leaving the family; in fact she hasnt touched a piano since his departure a few years ago but an unwanted scholarship to Juilliard is awaiting her. First-time director Julie Ann Robinson gives us Miley as a rebellious skanky-haired nose-ring-wearing pouting cliche. Soon after arriving on the island the New York teen falls in with some outsider neer-do-wells before reluctantly falling for Will (Liam Hemsworth) a hunky blueblood who can quote Tolstoy in two languages and tune up his pickup truck too. Their summer love has its ups and downs mirroring her situation with her dad. With a piano as the peacemaker Ronnie and her father reconcile and suddenly her nose ring disappears and her hair looks salon-styled. Feed Loader Touchstone Pictures Ronnie reconnects with her father played by Greg Kinnear In interviews to promote this movie Miley has stressed that she is planning to take a break from music and concentrate on acting. On the big screen just as on TV her smile works better than her pout (why do you think her dad Billy Ray Cyrus dubbed her Smiley Miley?). Shes believable as Ronnie partly because she too is 17 and at a crossroads in her life. (Can you say ""Goodbye Hannah Montana""?) Still its not likely that ""The Last Song"" will do for Mileys dramatic career what Sparks ""A Walk to Remember"" did for teen pop star turned actress Mandy Moore in 2002. Miley fans should not let the title of ""The Last Song"" lead you to think she sings in this movie. Her only warbling is to harmonize with Maroon 5s ""She Will Be Loved"" on the radio while riding in Wills truck. She does however contribute a couple of numbers to the soundtrack. The most memorable acting is by Coleman 12 a veteran of a dozen films. Hes not the usual cute-as-a-button little dude but like the kid brother in ""The Blind Side"" he gets a lot of great lines and delivers them with aplomb. As the father Kinnear has a certain absent-minded charm though he looks more and more like Hugh Laurie of TVs ""House"" as this movie plays out. The hopelessly handsome Hemsworth simply seems to be auditioning for the role of a young Matthew McConaughey. But offscreen he got the girl too -- Miley that is -- so you could say that he has the best of both worlds.

"Movie Review The Last Song - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Movie Review The Last SongMiley Cyrus. Shirtless hunk. Romance. You know this tune already. After all its by Nicholas Sparks. For some tears will flow. For others eyes will roll.March 31 2010|By Michael Ordona There arent a lot of surprises in store when a film is struck from Nicholas Sparks and is called ""The Last Song."" There will be young love in the picturesque South there will be a battery of contrivances keeping those crazy kids apart and there will be tragedy and much rending of hair.""Last Song"" is one of those maudlin romantic melodramas you just cant warn folks off. Theyre going to see it though they know the story before they get in the car. Sullen half-heartedly goth teen Ronnie (Miley Cyrus sans ""Hannah Montana"" trappings) is dropped off with energetic kid brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) for a coastal summer with estranged musician dad Steve (Greg Kinnear). Piano prodigy Ronnie has quit playing out of spite; Dad patiently bears her teen angst. Despite -- because of? -- her sulking Ronnie catches the eye of dreamy local stud Will (Liam Hemsworth) whose shirtlessness is explored in depth. Spoiler alert Wills terrible secret is that hes perfect.There are bells and whistles -- swimming in aquarium tanks which is an awesome first-date trick if you can get away with it again and again; the usual wan rivalries; an unconvincing threat from a minor character -- but the two strands that matter are whether Ronnie will forgive her father and reconnect before the coda and whether she will forgive Will for whatever wrong grace note hes hit thats so awful she would turn a deaf ear to him.But this is what its come to with modern romance. Its just too easy to communicate these days when its important. So the crafters of heavy-handed fluff must rely on audiences goodwill to accept that characters who were willing to go to ""Say Anything"" lengths for someone just a scene ago suddenly cant find a name in their contact lists. In ""Dear John"" Sparks resorted to Sept. 11 and autism as plot points. Here the scale is smaller but the theatrics are equivalent. Even more than in most specimens of the genre the characters are die-cast figures whose positions on the board were not to question though little justification for their moves together or apart is forthcoming. The acting is similarly an unconnected series of camera-ready smiles and poses. Only Kinnear survives the attrition sort of.Giving serious consideration to a widget such as ""Last Song"" is like dancing about architecture. Those hungry for this kind of calculated faux-emotional escapism can order the usual from this familiar menu and really whats wrong with that? There was audible sobbing in the screening this reviewer attended so somebody cares. But for those wondering if the continuing popularity of such exercises might make this one worth the ticket price the same effect might be achieved by writing names and obstacles (make some tragic) on index cards and tossing them in the air.calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWhy Miley Cyrus mattersSeptember 10 2013Review Miley Cyrus Wonder World concert at Staples...September 24 2009Miley Cyrus Teen Choice performance sparks debateAugust 12 2009Hannah Montana takes Miley Cyrus on a (safe) voyage of...April 10 2009Miley Cyrus album misses the top spotApril 2 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewMiley CyrusEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-last-song31-2010mar31,0,5786816.story",200,thelastsong8,thelastsong,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Huffing through the early scenes of The Last Song with black leather boots and a frozen pout Miley Cyrus plays author Nicholas Sparks idea of a rebel which is to say Ned Flanders idea of a rebel. Her nose is pierced (modestly) she shoplifted (once) shes a vegetarian she listens to music unlikely to be covered on American Idol and she hasnt followed through on an unsolicited admittance offer from Juilliard. (She doesnt drink however lest anyone mistake her for a woman of loose morals.) Based on Sparks novel The Last Song offers a taming-of-the-shrew scenario so relentlessly bland and old-fashioned it makes Dear John the Sparks adaptation from two months ago look like Last Tango In Paris. Taking the tiniest of baby steps out of the Disney brand--shuffling right on over to Touchstone in fact--Cyrus stars as a disenchanted 17-year-old still reeling from her parents divorce. An overqualified Greg Kinnear plays her father a musician and artist who retreated to a beachside home on Tybee Island Georgia where he labors over the stained-glass replacement window for a small church recently damaged in a fire. Unlike her eager-to-please little brother (Bobby Coleman) Cyrus isnt so quick to forgive her dad for abandoning them so she goes under the boardwalk to sulk with the townies. When resident hunk Liam Hemsworth shows her some attention she initially rebuffs his advances but after a few kindnesses a trip to the aquarium and a beach volleyball game shes more or less putty in his hands. This being a Nicholas Sparks scenario the big question isnt ""Hows this blissful summer going to end?"" but ""Whos got cancer?"" and on a related note ""Whos going to take solace from the sea and/or sunset?"" To be fair the element of surprise isnt high on Sparks dramatic agenda. What he really wants is to dampen Kleenexes whether through the symbolic care of baby sea turtles or sob stories about long-lost siblings or an unfinished piano composition that could use the Juilliard touch. But save for Kinnear whos relaxed and confident enough not to press the emotions too hard the cast doesnt have the chops to give much life to those big tear-jerker moments. That The Last Song manipulates is a given; that it manipulates so incompetently is unforgivable.

"The Last Song review Its Young Love Inc. and hard to buy |       NJ.com comments The Last Song review Its Young Love Inc. and hard to buy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 30 2010 at 629 PM updated March 30 2010 at 637 PM View/Post Comments TOUCHSTONE PICTURESMiley Cyrus is the troubled teen and Liam Hemsworth portrays her boyfriend in ""The Last Song."" ""The Last Song"" is a new teen-oriented romantic drama starring Miley Cyrus and based on a book by Nicholas Sparks. Unsurprising and inoffensive the movie is likely to delight sad young girls and bore bitter old critics. But its even more likely to fascinate marketing students because ""The Last Song"" is the story of two huge commercial brands -- and two very different aims. The Last Song (PG) Touchstone (107 min.) Directed by Julie Ann Robinson. With Miley Cyrus Liam Hemsworth Greg Kinnear Bobby Coleman. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys review TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains mild sensuality and violence. The first product is the Nicholas Sparks Romance -- and its trademarks have all been carefully preserved here. Theres the coastal Southern setting the chaste young love that goes wrong the character with the tragic secret the unexpected reminder of mortality the final uplifting ending. The second product is smiley Miley Cyrus -- but her well-known image has been just as carefully revamped. This is her first time not playing Hannah Montana or herself and the point is to present the not-quite-18 celebrity as a young adult and a real actress. The first brand comes off better than the second. Its easy to make fun of Sparks books which often feel not so much written as word-processed. Yet their well-worn combination of survived tragedy and chaste love also undeniably works. (By the end of the screening the young woman behind me was sobbing happily.) Cyrus is more problematic. Its an awkward age for any actress but she tries too obviously. Her attempts to be hard-edged and troubled just come off as bratty; coupled with her chipmunky appeal (and scratchy untrained speaking voice) its the worst of both worlds. And it doesnt help that her on-screen (and apparently off-screen) boyfriend is the lunky Channing Tatum-Lite actor Liam Hemsworth. Or that their courting consists of him dousing her in milkshakes or mud or dropping her in giant aquariums or hosing her off in the backyard. Get a room? More like get a towel. The typically pleasant and underrated Greg Kinnear though is very good as Cyrus estranged father (the whisper-thin plot has her spending a summer with him). Young Bobby Coleman is excellent as Cyrus younger brother (hes that rare creature an adorable child actor who doesnt know it yet) and newcomer Carly Chaikin plays the ""bad girl"" -- always the best part -- with an exciting mixture of wildness and vulnerability. Halfway in I began wishing desperately that Chaikin was playing the lead -- but that wouldnt have served either of the big brands behind this movie both of which have their own aims. The Original Nicholas Sparks Romance Factory accomplishes its goals. The New Miley Cyrus Acting Company falls a bit shorter. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Last Song Drama. Starring Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Julie Anne Robinson. (PG. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To watch ""The Last Song"" is to feel a little sorry for Nicholas Sparks. If hes like almost every other writer he didnt write the screenplay as a cynical exercise but in the hope of doing something worthwhile. And then that hope imploded with the performance of Miley Cyrus who makes her debut here as the star of a dramatic feature. Of course Cyrus made sense from a box office perspective - thats the horror the devils bargain of it all. But at any point in the process as the agents were being contacted and the offers being made did anybody have her do a screen test? And if she did one did anyone take the dollar signs away from their eyes long enough to actually see it? Because the bottom line here is that Cyrus is ghastly in ""The Last Song"" bad not just in one or two ways but in all kinds of ways. It was a disservice to the audience to the material and to Cyrus herself that she was put in this position. Cyrus cant think onscreen which means she really cant act. All she can do is play an attitude. Cast as a teenage girl in pain over her parents divorce Cyrus plays one note - rage - in scene after scene. Theres no motivating anguish underneath the anger. Its all surface snarling and sneering and within minutes she alienates the audience. She makes herself repellent and doesnt seem to know it.

Photo Handout MCT Movie review One-note actress in Last Song 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Its in the script for example that as soon as Ronnie (Cyrus) arrives with her little brother to spend the summer with her father (Greg Kinnear) the nicest handsomest boy in town (Liam Hemsworth) takes an immediate interest in her. But nothing in either Cyrus performance or manner indicates why he should. Though Cyrus moves well enough within the controlled atmosphere of her music videos ""The Last Song"" reveals her as an ungainly presence galumphing from scene to scene. Her face which turns down when it should turn up is without wit and her smile is not warming or convincing. She has the look and aura of a character actress minus the acting and the character. Then again charm can go a long way onscreen toward covering up performance flaws. Alas Cyrus either has no cinematic charm or does one of the best jobs of suppressing it in living memory. So ""The Last Song"" has a problem. The whole mechanism is constructed around our caring about the emotional development of a character we very quickly wish would disappear. But ""The Last Song"" has more than a Miley Cyrus problem. It also has a script problem and this is where we can stop feeling sorry for Nicholas Sparks and start taking pity on Julie Anne Robinson a TV director making her feature debut. Did Robinson feel reluctant to challenge Sparks over scenes that make no emotional sense? There are at least a half-dozen of them in ""The Last Song"" - false crises false arguments false reactions. The plot construction is weak. Incidents dont flow one into the next. Instead one thing happens. Then another (unrelated) thing happens and then another. Though much of the film involves teenagers talking among themselves the teenagers in ""The Last Song"" sound nothing like any teenagers who have ever walked the earth. Greg Kinnear may be warm and precise as Ronnies father but the movie is otherwise a tepid puddle of mush. Theres an idea about life being sold here something about people being imperfect that they make mistakes that they screw up. This is said at least three times over the course of the film. But in the end this idea continues people mean well and everything works out fine. Thats a lie and this movie is the proof. -- Advisory This movie contains adult situations.

Starring Miley Cyrus Bobby Coleman Liam Hemsworth Hallock Beals Nick Lashaway Carly Chaikin Nick Searcy Kate Vernon Kelly Preston Greg Kinnear Director Julie Anne Robinson Running time 148 Release Opened Mar 31 2010  Editorial Review The Last Song Is the weeper a keeper?By Dan KoisWednesday March 31 2010""The Last Song"" starring teen pop star Miley Cyrus is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks which means that its title might as well be ""There Will Be Tears."" Just like ""The Notebook"" ""Message in a Bottle"" and every other Sparks adaptation ""The Last Song"" hews closely enough to the Sparks pattern of romance and bathos that tears will flow as copiously in the audience as they do on screen. But can ""The Last Song"" succeed in its other less obvious objective to make a viable grown-up movie actress out of Cyrus the star of Disneys ""Hannah Montana"" franchise? Thats less clear.In ""The Last Song"" Cyrus tries on some emo-inspired black outfits a nose stud and a bad attitude as she not-quite-convincingly plays troubled high school senior Ronnie Miller. Fresh from a shoplifting arrest at home in New York Ronnie is shipped off along with little brother Jonah to their fathers beach house in some alternative version of Georgia where no one has a Southern accent. You may not think summer at the beach sounds like much of a punishment but Ronnie - a piano prodigy who hasnt played since her parents broke up - sure does and she spends the movies first half-hour yelling at her dad (Greg Kinnear) and staring out at the sea.Salvation comes of course in the form of a boy - in this case hunky Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth). We know hes perfect for her because he quotes Tolstoy because hes rich and hot and because hes just damaged enough to trigger Ronnies rescue impulses. The summer romance moves so fast that a mere two scenes after a swoony first kiss at sunset Will is writing ""FOREVER"" on Ronnies Chuck Taylors.And its no spoiler to anyone who has seen a Sparks movie that soon afterward someone gets sick and eventually dies.Its not hard to make a sad satisfying movie out of the ingredients assembled here final hugs brave smiles crying kids and piano tributes. But it is hard to make a good one and ""The Last Song"" in the end isnt very good despite nice performances from Kinnear and Bobby Coleman who plays Jonah with a welcome absence of smart-alecky kid-brother shenanigans.First-time film director Julie Anne Robinson cant get much out of the slack screenplay (written by Sparks and Jeff Van Wie) and mostly lets the soundtracks never-ending acoustic guitar do the emotional heavy lifting. Cyrus is game and appealing but shes not nearly enough of a natural actress to pull off the emotional whip-cracks the story puts Ronnie through.Will ""The Last Song"" resonate with a certain generation of young women the way say ""The Notebook"" has? Im not sure. The audience I saw it with responded with as many giggles as sniffles and after the screening two women in their early 30s chatted happily in the elevator seemingly unaffected by ""The Last Songs"" tragic end. Then one of them brought up ""The Notebook."" Before we got to the parking deck they had both dissolved into tears.Kois is a freelance reviewer.PG. At area theaters.

Miley Cyrus sizable t(w)een audience will surely lend its ears to ""The Last Song"" a soapy meller that transitions the young pop star from the Disney Channel to the bigscreen while giving girls what theyd seem to want and nothing more. Shirtless boys cute animals a dress-shopping excursion and a good cry all factor into the Nicholas Sparks-adapted tale of Ronnie Miller (Cyrus) a New York City kid forced to spend a summer with her divorced dad (Greg Kinnear) in seaside Georgia. Opening March 31 in a strategic mid-spring-break release ""Song"" should sound like ""ka-ching"" at the B.O. Reportedly initiated by the star who wished to emulate the 2002 Sparks-sourced Mandy Moore vehicle ""A Walk to Remember"" ""The Last Song"" is a predictable but not unpleasant bid to reassure young fans -- and their moms -- that the rapidly maturing Cyrus still holds family values. Arriving at Dads beachfront house with tall black boots and a chip on her shoulder Ronnie makes fast friends with a questionable young woman named Blaze (Carly Chaikin) and eventually falls in love with a volleyball-playing hunk (Liam Hemsworth). But thank heavens she also helps in the restoration of a Baptist church protects a batch of turtle eggs from a hungry raccoon and returns to piano playing after years of thinking it silly. Following in the footsteps of ""Jailhouse Rock"" ""Purple Rain"" and countless other pop-star vehicles pic uses the story of a rebellious characters spiritual conversion to fortify a musicians fan base. However only the last song in ""The Last Song"" is sung by Cyrus; her current chart-climber ""When I Look at You"" plays over the end credits. The rest of the soundtrack features comparatively harder pop from the likes of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club the better to characterize Ronnies ultimate redemption. As Steve Miller aka Dad an earnest scruffy Kinnear is the sole beneficiary of the films mild laugh lines -- at least until his character starts to cough signaling co-screenwriter Sparks umpteenth move into tear-jerking territory. As the boyfriend who turns out to be filthy rich Hemsworth is just as cute as he needs to be. Cyrus alas hasnt yet learned not to act with her eyebrows and overbite. But she does show off her considerable chops as a pianist and remains reasonably likable throughout. Aside from an unfortunate scene in which Ronnie is silenced by a kiss (and a pushily romantic soundtrack tune) ""The Last Song"" directed by TV vet Julie Anne Robinson maintains a healthy respect for girls. Louise Frogleys costume design including clothes spoiled by mud and a spilt strawberry shake is perfect. Georgia lensing by John Lindley looks beach-bright and otherwise undistinguished.

Its the worst of both worlds as Disney cash cow Miley Cyrus makes the most dubious ""dramatic"" debut of any singer since Britney Spears in ""The Last Song"" -- a risible Nicholas Sparks tear-jerker that makes the recent similar film derived from Sparks ""Dear John"" look like ""The Notebook"" by comparison. Displaying approximately 11/2 expressions the teenage Cyrus pouts her way through a fire a wedding and a funeral -- not to mention intervening in an abusive relationship digging out guilty secrets and resisting overtures from her dad whom shes never forgiven for her parents divorce. PHOTOS SHIRTLESS SHOTS OF LIAM HEMSWORTH Along with her annoyingly precocious younger brother (Bobby Coleman) Cyrus -- whose character has improbably been raised in New York City -- is being forced to spend the summer in a sun-dappled Southern beach town with her dad. This impossible role is played by Greg Kinnear who manages to recite purple prose like ""love is fragile and were not always its best caretakers"" with a straight face. This being the sort of movie where the audience knows whats going to happen about 45 minutes before the characters do Kinnears makeup and demeanor from the first shot (not to mention the high mortality rate in Sparks adaptations) rather obviously telegraph that he may not make it till the final reel. Miley is also making a halfhearted attempt to resist romantic overtures from a volleyball-playing rich boy portrayed by bland Aussie hunk Liam Hemsworth who has become Cyrus boyfriend in real life -- something not at all reflected by their total lack of on-screen chemistry. Though a blond ex-girlfriend and the heros snobbish mother try to split them we know theyve bonded over her trying to help sea turtles hatch on the beach. Sparks himself collaborated on the very moist screenplay whose occasionally hilarious excesses are underlined by Julie Anne Robinsons ham-fisted direction and Aaron Zigmans schmaltzy score even though they are already IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS WITH EXCLAMATION POINTS I should mention that Cyrus character is a pianist whose youthful reputation is such that Juilliard has accepted her without an audition -- despite the fact that her piano solos in the film have been doubled by an obviously older pair of hands. Because ""The Last Song"" is an attempt to position Cyrus as an actress her singing is limited to briefly accompanying a song by Maroon 5 on the radio. ""Wow YOU CAN REALLY SING"" says the boyfriend. To paraphrase ""Citizen Kane"" that thankfully isnt my department. But act? I dont think so. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next New Twilight novella on tap for June before next movie h...

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday March 30 2010 1028 PM Title Coming-of-age drama about a teens summer romance. With Miley Cyrus Greg Kinnear. Director Julie Anne Robinson (148). PG Violence mature themes. At area theaters.No Miley Cyrus fans ""The Last Song"" does not refer to Cyrus desire to hang up her Hannah Montana wig.In fact neither Hannah nor her high spirits are anywhere to be found in Julie Anne Robinsons underwhelming romance.Actually tweens raised on the pop energy of ""Hannah"" and ""High School Musical"" will be thoroughly bored by the generic story (and disappointed by the title; Cyrus plays some piano but barely sings).Meanwhile the PG antics and Robinsons flat direction are unlikely to interest their big sisters or moms.For her debut as a more mature actress Cyrus and her team chose a script from Nicholas Sparks (and co-writer Jeff Van Wie). But of course shes still only 17. So were stuck with the mildest version of the Sparks formula most recently seen in the strikingly similar ""Dear John.""Cyrus plays Ronnie a high school grad spending summer in Tybee Island Ga. with her musician-father (Greg Kinnear).Shes still smarting from her parents divorce and nursing a major attitude. This means ignoring her acceptance to Juilliard and befriending kids who spend all night partying under the boardwalk. (She herself declines -- Disney still has an icon to protect after all.)Her anger softens a bit when she meets Will (Liam Hemsworth) a pretty boy with unexpected depth. They bond they break up and somebody develops an ominous Movie Cough that brings everything into perspective.Its hard to believe this bland starlet is the same spunky kid who bounced through the Hannah Montana movie just last year but its only fair to cut Cyrus some slack.It cant be easy to transition through adolescence so publicly especially when you have to worry about finding new fans while pleasing old ones.So who was the movie really made for? Mostly it seems for Cyrus herself who needed to take the first hesitant step in another direction. Thats understandable especially for someone whose career has been so carefully packaged.But she cant always play it this safe Growing up means taking risks even if the whole world is watching.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Can nothing break Miley Cyruss grip on our hearts? Last year she confessed that the love expressed for Jay-Z on her hit single ""Party in the U.S.A.  was fraudulent. Yet we continued -- to quote the song -- moving our hips like yeah. When her tutorials with ""American Idol contestants produced some of the worst live singing since the previous week enthusiasm for her new movie marched on.""The Last Song based on a Nicholas Sparks novel that Sparks co-adapted improves negligibly over ""Hannah Montana the Movie in which Cyrus wrestled with whether or not to bite the Hannah that feeds her. This time the waggily arms bug eyes and synthetic truculence suggest that you can take the girl out of Montana but you cant take the Montana out of the girl. She plays Ronnie a sullen 17-year-old New Yorker dropped off for the summer at the quaint North Carolina beach house of her composer father (Greg Kinnear). Her younger brother (the mercilessly spunky Bobby Coleman) goes with her.Ronnie never misses an opportunity to make dad feel bad for splitting up with her mom (Kelly Preston). Shes so spiteful that she hasnt touched a piano in years and refuses to attend Juilliard which has accepted her on the basis of her reputation. Presumably the admissions officers moved their hips like yeah. But a kiss from a boy allows her to drop the moody-teen act. Will (Liam Hemsworth) plays beach volleyball. He carries 1 percent body fat. He fixes cars at the local garage. He saves turtles with the wildlife rescue. Hes rich. And he too might be in New York for college.Their romance is touch-and-go. An ex-girlfriend of Wills tries to make Ronnie jealous. His familys snobbery grates. He withholds too much crucial information for too long. A normal girl would be able to reason past all this. A normal boy would quit while hes ahead. But Will is anything but normal. Its true that he has the generic American handsomeness of Paul Walker and Channing Tatum but with the fuller lips and nose of Tyrese Gibson. From a distance he looks like John Krasinski. Shockingly Hemsworth is Australian. Unlike a lot of non-American actors who play Americans he sounds like he comes from somewhere other than the classroom of a dialect coach. So what if that somewhere is behind the register at American Eagle Outfitters? I at least know where that is.The director Julie Anne Robinson makes sure that any scene that might culminate in thought or reflection instead becomes a montage set to music. In 90 seconds Will fights at a wedding hatchling sea turtles waddle to the ocean and a character has a sudden collapse. Sparks is not a man of discretion. Even a passing familiarity with his books leads you to believe hes a maudlin death panelist. ""The Last Song is as blunt a title as ""Hot Tub Time Machine. Whose song it is youll have to see for yourself. But the finale reveals that its author must have been thinking about the shower scene in a work of soft-core pornography.In ritualizing death Sparks whose formula of beaches and bad news runs aground here crosses over into bathetic profanity. His characters die because its all he can think to have them do. This is the sort of petty recriminating movie that has to punish its characters bad attitudes by making them sit at bedsides or cater at fancy weddings. (One girl on the verge of homelessness could buy herself a month of shelter simply by putting her 500 sandals on eBay.)A more convincing star could make this a degree more tolerable although in Cyruss defense not much more. Shes cute whether shes smiling crying or wearing a pretty lavender dress. Itd be nice to see her do some acting but that doesnt appear to be high on the movies list of priorities. Allegedly this is the film in which Cyrus gets all like dramatic. If by ""dramatic one means pouty sullen and cute then OK. But its not tragedy you sense behind those big brown eyes.

As many of his books tell stories of young love clinging to the trellis of hope they make ideal vehicles for actresses transitioning from teenage to adult roles. His familiar motifs of love blooming across class divisions and despite unforeseen tragedy and family feuds have made him the undisputed Kaiser of Kleenex.In the tradition of Mandy Moore Rachel McAdams and Amanda Seyfried Miley Cyrus - the artist formerly known as Hannah Montana - does Sparks in The Last Song an effective and relatively restrained tearjerker for daddies and their daughters.Cyrus plays Ronnie short for Veronica a Gothish 17-year-old. She is a piano prodigy who hasnt been near a Steinway since her parents divorce three years ago. Despite Ronnies nimbus of negativity people are drawn to her. Reflexively she pushes them away. ""Thats what Im good at"" she tells her mother.Then Ronnies mom (Kelly Preston) deposits daughter and preteen son Jonah (Bobby Coleman) for the summer at dads weathered beach house (Wilmington N.C. in the book but Tybee Island Ga. in the movie). Her hope is that the spawn will reconnect with their estranged parent (Greg Kinnear as Steve).Bolting from dads house Ronnie runs smack into Will (Liam Hemsworth) a hunk playing beach volleyball. Hes interested in Ronnie. Shes interested in maintaining her pose of indifference and buries her nose in Tolstoys Anna Karenina you know the one with the famous opening line about all unhappy families being unhappy in their own way?This low-key film from veteran TV director Julie Anne Robinson (from a screenplay by Sparks himself) is properly focused on character. (This is in stark contrast to most Sparks adaptations which feature thrashing seas and summer storms as correlatives of the characters emotional weather.) Crisply Robinson establishes Ronnies fear of intimacy as fear of abandonment. Her father broke her heart. Why should she trust him - or any male?As Ronnie Cyrus is two-note Petulant or tentatively hopeful. Despite (or because of) years of TV training Cyrus lacks emotional range. She moves with self-consciousness as though acutely aware of the camera. Still her moods are relatable - especially when Ronnie dedicates herself to protecting a nest of turtle eggs and Will sees turtle duty as a way to get close to her.The early sequences of the film seem rushed introducing the audience to a number of characters who are significant to the subplots but fairly disposable and one-dimensional in the main story line. The three parallel love stories of daughter and dad girlfriend and boyfriend sister and brother are nicely handled. Robinson is a sympathetic director of actors allowing almost everyone their dignity. For the most part she keeps this emotionally charged story in the schmaltz-free zone.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Last Song  (out of four)Stars Miley Cyrus Greg Kinnear Liam Hemsworth Kelly PrestonDirector Julie Ann RobinsonDistributor Touchstone PicturesRating PG for thematic material some violence sensuality and mild languageRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Why The Last Song comes out less than two months after its tearjerker clone Dear John is a mystery only competing studio execs and best-selling novelist Nicholas Sparks could explain. Both films -- the earlier released by Sony and this one by Disneys Touchstone Pictures-- come off as calculated attempts to milk the most box-office dollars from melodramatic material. And given the success of films based on Sparks books like 2004s The Notebook its a shrewd move. Sparks wrote both the Dear John and The Last Song novels but the new film is his first screenplay. TRAILER Get a sampling of The Last Song Its not news that studio movies are more derivative than ever. On Friday the repurposed version of 1981s Clash of the Titans opens and in two weeks the American remake of the little-seen British comedy Death at a Funeral hits theaters. On the horizon Iron Man 2 Sex and the City 2 and Toy Story 3. But at least those movies waited a respectful period for the original to get cold. The Last Song has much the same formulaic story as Dear John. Miley Cyrus sulks and sneers her way through her first dramatic role. There is a modicum of chemistry between the rebellious Ronnie and the polite and ecologically minded Will (Liam Hemsworth). But perhaps to hedge her shaky dramatic bets about halfway through the movie Cyrus bursts into song along with the radio. Hemsworth duly compliments her lest we forget her claim to fame. Ronnie has left New York reluctantly to spend the summer in Georgia with her estranged father Steve (Greg Kinnear). She tends to walk around in a snit ignoring his efforts to connect. A gifted pianist she has stopped playing just to spite him. Miraculously she has been awarded a scholarship to Juilliard despite the concerns of her mother (Kelly Preston) that Ronnie barely graduated high school and ""failed her SATs"" -- a remarkable feat given that its not a pass/fail test. But Sparks has never let realism get in the way of his trained focus on audiences tear ducts. The overbearing sentimentality is leavened by Kinnears grounded performance. Whether in a comedy (Little Miss Sunshine) or drama (Auto Focus) Kinnear lends intelligence and believability to his roles. When the story revolves around the romance its mostly predictable beach montages and goofy antics. But things improve when gears shift to probe Kinnears character. His affability invests the sappy tale with some authenticity. As in Dear John a hunky blond guy and sassy girl meet cute on the beach. Both films contend with obstacles impeding the course of true love fraught familial relationships senseless tragedies youthful criminality and life-threatening illnesses. All the obvious elements combine to manipulate the audience into a weepy time at the movies -- again.
