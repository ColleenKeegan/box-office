Itas borderline infuriating. 114 Shares Share 94 Tweet 20 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo Gemma LaMana/Best of Me Productions As presented in the opening scenes of the latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation The Best of Me Dawson Cole the films male protagonist is the Nicholas Sparks-iest character you could imagine. Played as an adult by James Marsden Dawson works on an oil rig reads Stephen Hawking books in his spare time sends cash money home in an envelope and looks up at the stars at night; hes a soulful strapping wandering working-class romantic. And of course he has a soul mate The beautiful Amanda (played as an adult by the great Michelle Monaghan) now a wife and mother who also likes to look up at the stars especially as an escape from her raging finance-bro hemorrhoid of a husband (Sebastian Arcelus). When a mutual acquaintance of Amanda and Dawsons passes away at the ripe old age of 92 he leaves behind his rural Louisiana cottage to the two of them. And thus we learn of what happened lo these many years ago -- how Amanda and Dawson came together and what drove them apart. As these tales go what we find out is not particularly melodramatic at first though it is predictable. Amanda (played as a teen by Liana Liberato) was a beautiful wealthy headstrong popular girl. Dawson (played as a teen by Luke Bracey who looks so comically unlike James Marsden that its legitimately distracting) was a long-haired outcast from the wrong side of the tracks with a white-trash family that looked like a gang of 19th-century train robbers. Both of them however wanted more out of life. Dawson liked to read physics textbooks on water towers by himself while the sun was setting; Amanda wanted to go to Tulane and study child psychology and public policy. As I will never tire of saying these things live or die by the chemistry of their leads. And both sets of leads -- both the young and ""old"" versions of Amanda and Dawson -- seem like they belong together. In particular Monaghan strikes a good balance between regret and anticipation. Her wide observant eyes and half-smile convey her hesitant desire; we sense that this is a woman with a complicated inner life full of regrets. And just in case you dont catch that sense of suggested regret the film makes sure to give her lines like ""I had so many plans I dont know what happened"" (This is the point where I feel compelled to note that Monaghan also currently stars in the far superior independent drama Fort Bliss out now in theaters and on VOD. She gives one of the best performances of the year in that film; go see it.) Theres a weird imbalance to The Best of Me that almost undoes the whole movie. For the most part the film is lush and calm Amanda and Dawson do a lot of circling around one another and they spend a lot of time in lovely settings (rows of weeping willows auburn sunsets sparkly lakes etc.) talking about what happened all those years ago ... without actually telling us what happened all those years ago. They dont have to tell us of course; the flashbacks will eventually do so for us. But that also means that this otherwise quiet movie is back-loaded with wild melodrama; it deliberately goes off the rails in the final act as both the crazy events of the past and the crazy events of the present converge. The imbalance doesnt help the movie; it feels manipulative rushed -- as if somebody remembered that this being a Nicholas Sparks movie it hadnt yet hit its Audience Teardrop Requisition Quota. Of course movies based on Sparks books are meant to be obvious and melodramatic. Thats why anybody watches them in the first place. But this also mandates that the wild plot twists and the revelations and the tearjerking climaxes be handled deftly; theyre part of the main attraction after all. And in The Best of Me the melodrama feels so hurried and half-baked that the end result isnt just disappointing. Its borderline infuriating.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 17 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 17 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Michael Hoffman Starring James Marsden Michelle Monaghan Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato Classification PG Country USA Language English When handsome socially awkward bayou boy Dawson Cole falls for perky ambitious rich girl Amanda it seems the couple may triumph despite his (curiously all-male) drug-dealing hillbilly family and her rich snob father. But tragedy intervenes and years later they meet for the reading of a common friends will. Passion is rekindled but how long can it last? Around two hours is par for the course for a movie based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. After 18 books and half as many movies (The Notebook Dear John A Walk to Remember) Sparkss preposterous approach has crystalized into cliche An adorable couple in a greeting card-pretty setting finds and loses and rediscovers love while destiny does distressing things to them for the audiences entertainment.Director Michael Hoffman (The Last Station) sticks to Sparkss moist emotional formula. The sunlight is golden the accents rural (this ones set in Louisiana) people die sagacious letters are read aloud. As the older Dawson and Amanda James Marsden (27 Dresses) and Michelle Monaghan (True Detective) emote with careworn sincerity while their peppy younger selves are played by non-lookalikes Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato ignorant that destiny is warming up in the bullpen.

If youre looking for the standard tropes of a Nicholas Sparks film adaptation The Best of Me has all of em the rain-soaked makeout session the disapproving rich parents the all-binding tragedies the masculine man-hands clasped against a womans jawline--seemingly to prevent a bobblehead. But what you might not be prepared for is the comprehensive unpleasantness that shrouds this new film just to get cheap rises out of the audience. And its done in such a pummeling manner that you might wonder if that violent actioner playing in the next theater over at the multiplex isnt so nasty after all. The story takes off in an innocuous Sparksian fashion Gorgeous rich lass (Liana Liberato then Michelle Monaghan as the married 20-years-older version) falls for gorgeous backroads boy with spectacular abs (Luke Bracey and later James Marsden). And theres more The handsome guy escapes his evil drug-dealing pa (Sean Bridgers putting the ick in sick here) to live with a Sparks specialty the Sensitive Grizzled Old Coot (played warmly by Gerald McRaney) whose name naturally is Tuck. As teens the lovebirds embody more variations on the authors themes Scarred Hot Guy Who Really Likes Physics But Breeds Trouble and Spunky Girl Interested In Social Work Who Loves Him Against All Odds. But how long will their feverish dalliance last with tragedy upon tragedy (and thats a low estimate) constantly getting in their way? Oh cruel fate. But then Tucks death years later reunites the former sweethearts. Even with lowered expectations toward escapist fare taken into account the film is a long slog with Marsden and Bracey conveying little but Crest smiles and smolder while Liberato and Monaghan are stuck doing endless cry-face. (Its a particular letdown to see Monaghan saddled with such drivel after her triumphant turn earlier this year as a similarly but far more interestingly unhappy wife in HBOs True Detective.) For all of the eventfulness it jams into a (poorly edited) two-hour package The Best Of Me ends up extracting the best of absolutely no one.

Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden star as a pair of former high school sweethearts in ""The Best of Me."" (Photo Peter Iovino)Nicholas Sparks movies inhabit their own universe. Its a place where love is a mystical force characters are painted with the broadest brush strokes possible and tragedy is inevitably lurking around the corner.Its a place where romance reigns supreme if your idea of romance was frozen in time at age 11 and its a place where cheesiness rules especially if you like your cheese covered in goop with a side order of sap.""The Best of Me"" is Sparks through-and-through which is to say it hits all of these parameters. It plays like a Greatest Hits for the author Its got the time-shifting element of ""The Notebook"" the crazy turns of ""Safe Haven"" and its shot through the gauzy filter of all of his movies.James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan are Dawson and Amanda ex-lovers brought back together after the death of Dawsons father figure Tuck (Gerald McRaney). We flashback to their early years (Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato play their younger selves) and watch their love affair blossom in the face of their differences Her family is rich his family is made up of mentally and physically abusive drug-runners. That old story.Time rips them apart and the film centers on whether these two actually belong together because of love. (Amanda is married with children but her husband is a drinker so its a wash.) The Louisiana setting leads to lots of shots of gardens and big beautiful trees which make the film unfold like a Lifetime movie with especially high production values.As a drama it fails but the camp value is high making it more fun than your average would-be weeper. Its silly but at least its not a slog.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaThe Best of MeGRADE C-Rated PG-13 for sexuality violence some drug content and brief strong languageRunning time 118 minutes 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1wa6VGo MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/10/17/campy-best-hits-sparks-marks-review/17379913/,200,thebestofme4,thebestofme,detroitnews

"The Best of Me makes love feel as real as a plastic rose review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Best of Me makes love feel as real as a plastic rose review There are no miracles in a Nicolas Sparks movie although there are moments in The Best of Me when you might be fooled. Dont fall for it.James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan star in The Best of Me the latest Nicholast Sparks novel to land on the big screen.  (MCT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 16 2014The Best of MeStarring Michelle Monaghan James Marsden Liana Liberato and Luke Bracey. Directed by Michael Hoffman. Opens Friday Oct. 17 at GTA theatres. 117 minutes. There are no miracles in a Nicolas Sparks movie although there are moments when you might be fooled.Such as when a sunbeam hits your eye just so. Or when youre staring at the stars and they twinkle back. Or when youre about to kiss someone in a garden and a flower suddenly presents itself for plucking.Article Continued BelowDont fall for it. Such things are as carefully sculpted as James Marsdens beard stubble in The Best of Me the latest gaseous emission from the Sparks melodrama machine. Marsdens stubble is no mere fashion statement. Its a failed attempt to disguise the fact that his character Dawson doesnt look a bit like Luke Bracey who plays the younger Dawson of 21 years earlier. This was back in more innocent times when working on an ocean oil rig seemed like a cool job for a humble grease monkey who yearned to be a physicist.This was also before the damn rig exploded tossing Dawson into the brink but not before hed heroically saved a couple of other lives as well as his own. He survived a fall that would have killed men of lesser destiny.Granted this may all seem pretty miraculous (the doc called it that) or at least golly-gee coincidence of a high order. Especially the way it all ties into news of the death of a beloved mentor (Gerald McRaney) which requires a return trip to Nowheresville Louisiana for the funeral whereupon Dawson has an unexpected meeting with ex-sweetheart Amanda played in flashback by Liane Liberato and in current times by Michelle Monaghan. (The two women dont look at all like each other either.) Dawson and Amanda were torn apart by fate or maybe it was poor hick Dawsons tragic inability to communicate with rich chick Amanda. Theyre brought together again by what might be destiny or maybe just a funeral.Such heartfelt thoughts are supposed to lull you into ignoring the many inanities and dialogue calamities in the script blamed on Will Fetters who is fond of romantic horticulture ""Pain has deep roots"" and ""Despite everything else the flowers still grow"" and similar rot.As I said this may all seem like some kind of miracle.But rub the pixie dust from your eyes and note how carefully each scene has been buffed and puffed to within an inch of its artificial hide.See that red dress Amanda likes to wear? Notice how its exactly the same shade of red as the Stingray sports car that Dawson suddenly acquires and the colour of the labels on the product-placement Budweiser they take on a picnic? You might start wondering if the flowers in the garden mentioned above are all made of plastic.Theres nothing divine about any of this except for the money The Best of Me is likely to ring up at the box office this week. For the record the movie has reportedly been directed by one Michael Hoffman. But since its based on one of Sparks bestselling novels (are there any other kind?) it may well have spontaneously birthed itself.Which is still no miracle just a regrettable inevitability.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Gemma LaMana / Relativity Media) Robert Abele Best of Me is a Nicholas Sparks romance that is ridden with every cliche in the genre Author Nicholas Sparks (""The Notebook"" ""Dear John"") never met a romantic cliche he didnt gently lay down atop a bed of roses in front of an orange-glow fireplace and Hollywood has always been there to film it.This 15-year affair -- going back to ""Message in a Bottle"" (and we got the message) -- continues with ""The Best of Me"" an opposites-in-love-then-apart-then-back-and-maybe-but-no weepie seesaw that could test even the most amenable to Sparks-ian heart-tugging. Painted to numerical specifications by director Michael Hoffman this one stars James Marsden as Dawson a heroic (check) hunky (check) Louisianan oil rigger of poor stock (check) who -- upon hearing of the death of an irascible-but-sweet surrogate father (check) -- is reunited with Amanda the rich-girl flame he left behind 20 years ago (check) played by Michelle Monaghan. Shes now married (check) but unhappy (check).Flashbacks to their unlikely romance (check) -- played by actors who look nothing like Marsden or Monaghan and in younger Dawsons case strangely older -- reveal golden times (check) cut short by awful circumstances (check) and regretted choices (check check check). And yet somehow that still isnt enough. Hes got an abusive criminal dad and is a secret smartie reading physics books on the water tower later Stephen Hawking on the oil rig. Shes got a father who tries to buy Dawson off then a drunk for a husband an abandoned calling and a child lost to leukemia. Dawsons surrogate father (Gerald McRaney) is a shotgun-toting widower who grows flowers. Everyone talks about destiny. They look at the stars. They dance to old records. They jump into the lake. Twice. Photos A behind-the-scenes look at filming around the world for television and movies as seen from the streets. Marsden and Monaghan are fine actors but youd swear The umpteenth time Monaghan has to look frozen in love/disappointment/heartsickness/wonder shes adding a frisson of ""Again really?"" And when this swollen case of meant-to-be-itis crams in prison and a heart transplant you might be staring too wondering if the title ""The Best of Me"" more accurately indicates a K-Tel package of every tear-jerker trope in existence. Check. Please.""The Best of Me.""MPAA rating PG-13 for sexuality violence drug content brief strong language.Running time 1 hour 58 minutes.

Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden star in this film adaptation of the book by Nicholas Spark. VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 928 p.m. EDT October 16 2014Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato in a scene from The Best of Me(Photo Relativity Media)Movies based on Nicholas Sparks weepy romance novels are the cinematic equivalents of paintings by Thomas Kinkade Schmaltzy set in bucolic locales and bearing an ultra-familiar stamp.The Best of Me is just the kind of cliched sentimental claptrap weve come to expect from these adaptations ( out four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).What makes it slightly better than the others is an affable low-key chemistry between James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan as star-crossed lovers.But the talented actors -- who shouldnt stoop to such overheated material -- are only on screen for about half the movie. Their teenage selves played by Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato are much less compelling.The unmistakable formula for Sparks adaptations -- this one makes nine and another is planned for next year -- remains intact The setting is a scenic Southern state a pretty couple from markedly different backgrounds falls madly in love but the course of their romance does not go smoothly.USA TODAYThe Best of Me continues streak of sopping wet Nicholas Sparks movie kissesThe ingredientsare consistent kindly elders terminal illnesses parents who range from clueless to cruel a shirtless hunk who is endlessly caring a sweet woman who stands by her man. Other hallmarks playful swimming scenes spontaneous slow dancing and tasteful softly lit lovemaking that focuses on faces not body parts. All this leads up to the money shot the over-arching grand gesture intended to induce copious amounts of tears -- usually occurring when the couple is separated by contrived circumstances. The Best of Me meets the necessary checklist as it traces the romantic arc of Dawson and Amanda from their teens in the early 90s to the present day. We first spot Dawson (Marsden) on a Louisiana oil rig. Just before he heroically risks his life to save some fellow workers following an explosion he can be spotted sitting on the deck reading Stephen Hawking. In his youth he built a telescope. In other words hes a brawny brainiac. Here the apple falls many football fields away from the tree since Dawsons cartoonishly villainous father (Sean Bridgers) runs what looks like a crackhouse. Wherever his dad goes hes flanked by a pair of seemingly inbred brothers with gap-toothed grins and egregious mullets. He mocks his son for reading and abuses him physically. Dawson runs away. Hes taken in by kindly widower Tuck (Gerald McRaney) Naturally Dawson and Amanda meet cute. Riding in a convertible filled with arrogant jerks Amanda clambers out to assist Dawson as he helps a friend with a stalled car. Shes a rich girl but no snob. She sees past Dawsons trashy family and into his loving heart. She encourages him to go to college. She admires his mind and his mechanical prowess and has a demure appreciation for his chiseled abs.Bracey is particularly badly cast. He bears not the slightest resemblance to Marsden (playing his older self). And the 25-year-old actor cannot believably pass for 17. The 19-year-old Liberato fares a notch better bearing at least a passing resemblance to Monaghan.The former high school sweethearts are reunited in their late 30s when they meet while clearing out Tucks house after his death as specified in his will.Their romance is as overwrought and mawkish as it is filled with forgettable tunes from such 90s bands as Toad the Wet Sprocket and the Spin Doctors.The Best of Me is not the worst adaptation of Nicholas Sparks but audiences can certainly choose better. 44 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1w9zW4M,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/16/the-best-of-me-review/17343855/,200,thebestofme10,thebestofme,usatoday

Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden star in this film adaptation of the book by Nicholas Spark. VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1113 a.m. MST October 16 2014James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan (and two actors who dont look like them) play lovers separated by tragedy who are brought back together. Sappy and ridiculous.James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan rekindle a lost romance in the attest Nicholas Sparks adaptation ""The Best of Me.""(Photo Relativity Media)Story HighlightsCritics review 1.5 starsJames Marsden and Michelle Monaghan are wasted in trite roles.The film is based on yet another Nicholas Sparks novel.The story goes from predictable to ludicrous.The irony of so many romantic movies is that they arent romantic.Instead theyre lazy. They require nothing of the audience other than to show up and sit there while boy meets girl boy loses girl etc. And yet they are a cottage industry; evidently there is a sizable market for movies that do all the work for you.So maybe ""The Best of Me"" will make a killing. Its based on a Nicholas Sparks novel which is a surefire indication of what well get a love story about as moving and genuine as a ballad crooned by a studio-manufactured boy band. They hit the right notes but theres not a drop of soul.There is however a convoluted plot that relies on flashbacks and two sets of actors for the same roles along with a final-act twist that is jaw-droppingly manipulative.Whats not to like?Related azcentral.coms newest movie reviews | Fall movie guideWhile recovering from an explosion on the oil rig on which he works Dawson (James Marsden) receives a phone call from a lawyer asking him to come to his small hometown -- an old friend has died. Meanwhile Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) a woman in the midst of a birthday party with her husband and child receives a similar call. The two arrive separately and run into each other at the home of the friend. Its awkward and there is mention made that they havent spoken in 21 years. But they agree to meet at the lawyers office tomorrow.When they arrive they learn that their friend Tuck has left them his cottage -- jointly. One can sell to the other or they can keep it together. More awkwardness ensues.More Qamp;A with James MarsdenAs do flashbacks. Now Dawson is played by Luke Bracey who looks nothing like Marsden Amanda by Liana Liberato (ditto). The resemblance is so off that it takes you a little while to figure out whats going on. We learn that Dawson had a horrible childhood eventually moving in with Tuck (Gerald McRaney) a gruff old coot with a tender heart. Dawson and Amanda a nice rich girl fall in love and start one of those unlikely romances in which you sit up on the water tower and talk about how beautiful the world is below.But what do you know? Tragedy intervenes they go their separate ways and it takes the balance of the movie to find out what and why.Fine. Thats a familiar variation on the plot of any number of romantic movies. But thats not the end. No director Michael Hoffman isnt done with us yet. Theres still some serious tugging at heartstrings ahead.Its all rather pretty and the little town is idyllic. Well except for the inbred cretins Dawson is related to. (Sean Bridgers is actually kind of good as his father in a creepy sort of way.)So youll laugh youll cry youll be swept away -- about as much as you would be by artificial roses. Movies like this may look like the real thing but theyre not.AZCENTRALThe Best of Me (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe Best of MeDirector Michael Hoffman.Cast James Marsden Michelle Monaghan Luke Bracey.Rating PG-13 for sexuality violence some drug content and brief strong language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Theres something unmistakably poignant about the sight of Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden circling each other with barely concealed romantic longing in ""The Best of Me"" though not for reasons anyone probably intended. The latest soap product to roll off the Nicholas Sparks assembly line this tale of two former lovers reuniting after a 21-year separation also functions as a study of two terrific actors struggling to overcome the relentless mediocrity of their material. With its ill-motivated swerves into violent tragedy and the near-fatal miscasting of one pivotal role the Relativity release seems likely to jerk as many laughs as tears from its target audience though Sparks fans might still turn out in sufficient date-night droves to continue the authors string of Hollywood hits. Sparks has cranked out a fresh slab of romantic hokum every year or so since 1996 and the studios have largely kept pace with his output hitching themselves to a high-yield cash cow that has produced at least one genuine four-hankie classic (""The Notebook"") and any number of lucrative duds (""The Last Song"" and ""The Lucky One"" among others). Like many films adapted from the authors work -- this time by writers Will Fetters and J. Mills Goodloe with Michael Hoffman directing -- ""The Best of Me"" spins a tale of young love imperiled by class prejudice set against a curiously deracinated Southern backdrop and infused with the sort of fuzzy-headed spirituality that often finds its characters peering skyward as though straining to see their fates written in the stars. One such stargazer is Dawson Cole (Marsden) a handsome 39-year-old mechanic who miraculously survives an oil-rig explosion and wonders if he could be destined for some higher purpose. Right on cue he learns of the death of his old friend and mentor Tuck (Gerald McRaney) prompting a return to his Louisiana hometown. There Dawson has an awkward reunion with his high-school sweetheart Amanda (Monaghan) from whom he separated 21 years earlier under mysterious circumstances and with whom he now jointly owns the plantation-style house where they used to spend hours in Tucks (and each others) blissful company. Exactly what transpired between the couple is cleared up in lengthy flashbacks to the autumn of 1992 when Amanda (now played by Liana Liberato) falls in love with Dawson (Australian thesp Luke Bracey) -- never mind that her father is one of the richest men in town while the Coles are all mullets and bullets a clan of white-trash neer-do-wells led by the unrepentantly nasty Tommy (Sean Bridgers clearly enjoying himself). When Tommy beats up Dawson one time too many leaving him with a lingering shiner that must have given the continuity supervisor a mild headache Tuck welcomes the young lad into his home -- an act of charity and friendship that sets a tense rivalry with the Coles in motion. A good kid plagued by a crushingly low sense of self-worth Dawson is too moody and withdrawn at first to respond to Amandas affections but he soon comes out of his shell as signaled by the vigorous baring of his torso. Before long he and his g.f. are making out in the rain jumping into a nearby watering hole and getting frisky by the fireplace while the Cowboy Junkies cover of ""Sweet Jane"" plays in the background. (With Amandas spirited encouragement Dawson also considers going to college; we know this because we see him burying his nose in a physics textbook.) Meanwhile back in the painful present the now ex-lovers struggle to make sense of their renewed attraction complicated by the fact that Amanda is now married with children. Conveniently enough her husband (Sebastian Arcelus) is a total jerk. Monaghan and Marsden (stepping into a role originally intended for Paul Walker before his death last year) are effortlessly appealing hugely talented actors who dont often get the leading-role showcases they deserve. While this isnt the vehicle to turn those fortunes around their scenes together are easily the movies finest as the grown-up Dawson and Amanda subtly negotiate the emotional distance between them and then gradually acknowledge that their love for one another remains unchanged. Theres sufficient drama in these moments to render superfluous the movies preposterously overplotted third act recklessly endangering characters in whom we have zero investment to begin with; to call it ""manipulative"" would be giving it far too much credit. Liberato (""If I Stay"") supplies a warm vivacious presence as Amanda and McRaney gives a gem of a performance as the lovable old coot who helps bring the star-crossed lovers together. But as the young Dawson the 25-year-old Bracey proves a distractingly odd choice on a number of levels; seemingly cast for his ability to look wounded and withdrawn he comes off as merely dull uninvolving and far too old for high school. Even if there were any resemblance between the two Braceys hulking uncharismatic performance would make him a poor fit for Marsden whose wry quicksilver charm may be his defining attribute as an actor. (""Somehow you have gotten even better-looking"" Monaghan tells Marsden at one point earning the films biggest and truest laugh.) Its gotten to the point where every new Sparks movie feels less like a standalone work than a minor variation on its predecessors (this years model of an attractive but unreliable automobile) and Hoffman (""The Last Station"" ""Gambit"") is hardly the helmer to break the mold. At times there seems to be a weird visual disconnect between foreground and background as if the characters had been digitally superimposed over a series of carefully processed Louisiana backdrops; the results feel not just artificial but thoroughly disposable. And insofar as ""The Best of Me"" is unlikely to be hailed as the best of anything audiences may as well console themselves by looking ahead to the star-crossed lovers of ""The Longest Ride"" and ""The Choice"" two new Sparks adaptations already in the works.

Rich says January 20 2016 at 603 am I did agree somewhat with some of the criticism in the review but overall I thought it was reaching. One thing unmentioned which I did find questionable was how Dawsons heart ends up being donated to Amandas son. Reply Jake says August 28 2015 at 1143 pm I dont agree with your haughty dismissal of this movie. Im able to enjoy a poignant love story and watch the performance of two very fine actors without Shakespearean dialogue. Anyone who has a lost love will understand. Reply Alex says October 16 2014 at 415 pm I could have told you Bracey would make a terrible young Marsden all you need to do is look at a picture of them. Who let this happen?

A long-dormant romance is rekindled after two decades. Director Michael Hoffman (157). PG-13 Sexuality violence. Area theaters. As any fan of ""The Notebook"" knows some Nicholas Sparks adaptations deserve to be praised as cozy romantic escapism. And then there are those gauzy odes to overwrought sentimentality that embarrass everyone. Like say ""The Best of Me."" We begin in the present day when former high school sweethearts Dawson (James Marsden) and Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) are living miserable lonely lives miles apart. A friends death brings them back together after 20 years. While they return to their Louisiana hometown we flash back to when they met as teens. In 1992 popular Amanda (now played by Liana Liberato) and troubled Dawson (Luke Bracey) fall madly in love. They share a magical summer filled with swimming holes and Spanish moss and stargazing from the town water tower. But then Dawson gets in serious trouble while tangling with his meth-dealing dad. Suddenly our young lovers are up a creek (sorry). He goes one way she goes another. By the time they reunite will it be too late? Luke Bracey and Liana Liberto play a younger version of the couple in The Best of Me. (Gemma LaMana) The answer to this question is so ludicrous and so utterly unsatisfying that it highlights every flaw we were previously willing to overlook for fantasys sake. Why for example is teenage Dawson played by a 25-year-old who looks nothing like Marsden? What are smart talented actors like Marsden and Monaghan even doing in such forgettably generic roles? And how did director Michael Hoffman who made ""Soapdish"" and ""One Fine Day"" and the Oscar-nominated ""The Last Station"" choose such mawkish material in the first place? There have been times when the right team has been able to transcend the gooey schmaltz of Sparks stories. This effort however sinks like a rock thrown into a sun-dappled lake shaded by magnolia trees sparkling under a sky of shooting stars. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews the best of me james marsden michelle monaghan liana liberato luke bracey michael hoffman Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan star in ""The Best of Me"" based on a Nicholas Sparks novel and sporting the usual tropes of doom hope fate and clunky dialogue. Photo Handout / McClatchy-Tribune News Service The Best of Me review Some of the worst of Nicholas Sparks 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Hes an oil-rig worker who reads Stephen Hawking an expert mechanic and did I mention hes gorgeous? This heroic humble specimen of perfect middle age also gardens. And cooks. His name? Dawson Cole. Because of course. Welcome back to the world of Nicholas Sparks with its kisses in the rain and unconvincing obstacles. This time around its ""The Best of Me"" directed by Michael Hoffman. Hoffman made ""The Last Station"" and ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"" (with Kevin Kline and Rupert Everett) so thats not the worst possible start. Indeed the film is an improvement on previous Sparks moody-doomed-love opuses such as ""The Last Song"" and ""Dear John."" If that is damning with faint praise the cogs here are the same as in his previous love machines The rough saint from the wrong side of the tracks and the princess who must watch him suffer; the tortured contrivances that keep them apart; some disaster intended as a surprise; and lots and lots of violins. Dawson (James Marsden) survives an accident and wonders if that indicates some deeper purpose in his life. He all but sprouts magnificent wings to carry him to his beautiful sacrifice. But first hes reunited with long-ago flame Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) and here come the flashbacks. Young Dawson (the magnetic Luke Bracey love child of Heath Ledger and Andy Gibb) has a meth-head family who drive him away. Taken in by an angelic veteran (Gerald McRaney) his new home becomes the vernal bower in which he romances Young Amanda (Liana Liberato). Rest assured some awful happenstance will keep them apart until they become Marsden and Monaghan and then there will be an even more improbable plot device in the stars. Because you know fate. Details are fudged. Didnt she quit drinking? Does his truck have a trapdoor? Is it normal to stand around in front of a rifle that people are struggling over? Despite all this and some real howlers in the breathless romance-y dialogue the actors are appealing enough and Hoffmans direction calm enough to qualify ""Best"" as better than its predecessors. Thats not much though and though the cinematography is pretty and the formula intact it seems unlikely that even fans of this sort of thing will be reaching for hankies. Much like M. Night Shyamalans Sparks very name on a property builds an expectation of landing in a certain familiar spot. Consumers of his previous products will suspect the truth. This time though the contortions required to pitch that softball provoked guffaws in the screening this critic attended. There are plenty of laugh lines as well ""You want me to fall back in love with you? How do I do that ... if I never stopped?"" ""Would you do one thing for me? Would you forgive yourself?"" For fun you can play IMDb roulette and guess which actor is saddled with which clunkers. That might be the best part of ""The Best of Me."" Michael Ordona is a Los Angeles freelance writer.

Telling the story of Dawson and Amanda -- high school sweethearts torn apart by cruel fate but reunited later in life when the death of a mutual friend brings them back to the small town where they grew up -- ""The Best of Me"" has to its sole credit a great cast James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan play the current version of our star-crossed lovers with Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato as their 1992 teenaged selves. See video James Marsden Michelle Monaghan Give Love a Second Chance in Nicholas Sparks The Best of Me (Video) All four are charismatic and easy to watch with a natural and engaging connection inside both couples regardless of timeline. (There is in fact one cross-time cut with a hint of flair -- like John Sayles in-camera time jumps in the classic ""Lone Star"" -- but other than that the film simply stumbles between eras.) The bad news is that no matter how charming or fizzy the chemistry between the actors might be theyre still trapped in the dead fake melodrama and brainless coincidences of a Nicholas Sparks story. Sparks best-selling novels and many film adaptations (""The Lucky One"" ""The Notebook"" ""Safe Haven"" et al.) have cemented his position as the Thomas Kinkade of American novels -- stunningly tacky yet strangely popular a brand defined by its blandness. Sparks stories are to actual romance what pro wrestling is to actual sports A loud overdone mix of sweaty clinches and implausible events leading  to a conclusion you knew well before the start never mind before the end. Director Michael Hoffman (""One Fine Day"" the recently dumped ""Gambit"" remake) shoots in Louisiana where the weather is conducive to sweat-sheened makeouts and the tax breaks are conducive to low-cost film making. The script by Will Fetters (whos written a prior Sparks-daptation ""The Lucky One"") and J. Mills Goodloe withholds and withdraws every time it might explain why Dawson and Amandas high school love in 1992 fell apart in the name of building fake suspense. Goodloe and Fetters are also not helped by Sparks novel itself which requires huge amounts of coincidence and tragedy to move forward much like a SUV demands constant fill-ups.  And the dialogue with soapy clunkers like ""I know you love my daughter ... but I cant have her anywhere near your family"" and ""At the end of it all I can say what it was like to love someone"" is so square and heavy it lands with a thud the instant it leaves the actors mouths. Also read Will Nicholas Sparks Best of Me Ignite the Passion of Notebook Dear John? With its never-ending string of secret wills tragic accidents felonies failures letters left behind by the recently deceased and criminal parents replaced by kindly mentors ""The Best of Me"" attains a state of humid hysteria as its characters kiss in the rain fight in the dirt and cry out all their feelings. But its all formula and a formula as pernicious and as profitable as any comic-book movie or other franchise defined primarily by the Roman numerals after its title. The technical workings of the film are all top-notch even if it seems its a shame that for example cinematographer Oliver Stapleton -- who has shot films as diverse and distinct as ""Earth Girls Are Easy"" ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""The Shipping News"" -- is reduced to capturing shirtless men gardening or long pans of Spanish moss hanging from the trees. Also read Brad Pitt Tank Saga Fury Ready to Rumble Past Gone Girl at Box Office Editor Matt Chesse after cutting challenging films like ""World War Z"" and ""Warrior"" now has to sew together off-the-rack montages where our leads dine on crawfish and laugh as a jangling song selection from the unremarkable soundtrack plays over any and all dialogue. A fish as the saying goes rots from the head down and its Sparks with his tacky writing and postcard-simple version of every subject from romance to relationships to sin to the South whos the source of that rot here. With a seemingly endless series of endings -- surely meant to tie up loose ends but instead strangling any sign of life out of what has gone before -- ""The Best of Me"" epitomizes the worst of modern big-screen romance as a one-man factory keeps pumping out movies in which familiarity and quantity not freshness and quality have become what the audience is conditioned to reward.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Sunsets willows autumn leaves old barns tree swings water towers--default desktop backgrounds or the mise-en-scene of a Nicholas Sparks adaptation? Sparks very specific imprint of tearjerker kitsch--tales of once-in-a-lifetime romance that invariably involve illness or death--comes pre-packed with its own imagery; just add one competent middle-brow director and two or more good looking leads and voilaThe Best Of Me is neither the best Sparks adaptation nor the worst; its merely the most recent. Directed by Michael Hoffman (The Last Station) the movie centers on Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) and Dawson (James Marsden) high school sweethearts who are reunited two decades later by the death of a friend who has named them the joint executors of his estate. Dawson is a scruffy hunky oil rig worker who reads Stephen Hawking bestsellers at lunchtime; Amanda is an unhappy housewife whose husband Frank (Sebastian Arcelus) takes business calls at the dinner table goes golfing with his buddies and generally does the kinds of things that are considered normal in real life but signify a crumbling marriage on-screen. While Amanda and Dawson are busy boxing up knickknacks the movie flashes back to 1993 where she (Liana Liberato) is a rich kid with the unlikely dream of someday becoming a lawyer and he (Luke Bracey who looks neither like a teenager nor anything like James Marsden) is a smart kid from a family of Depression-era hicks who sit around in waistcoats playing poker and listening to old-timey music. She badgers him into taking her out for a date while hes fixing up a vintage pick-up. They eat gelato while sitting on the town water tower jump off piers into ponds and bond over the Cowboy Junkies cover of ""Sweet Jane.""As the relationship of the young Amanda and Dawson falls apart in one timeline their older selves drift back together in the other. Thats a fairly simple maudlin structure and it remains that way until the movie reaches its over-heated soapy third act which throws in an accidental death an emergency heart transplant some meth-gang shoot-outs and assorted other ludicrous twists. One of the quirks of Sparks adaptations--which can either be endearing or irritating--is that theyre incapable of treating romance on its own terms; as far as theyre concerned its not true love unless its predestined and somebody gets cancer. Theyre romances in the same sense that a cake is a meal.

Jody Mitori James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan in ""The Best of Me"" If youre anything like Amanda and Dawson youve never forgotten your first love that summer you spent skinny-dipping in the bayou rebuilding the carburetor of a classic Mustang and reading physics textbooks atop the old water tower. But if youre an actual human being with functioning brain cells youll recognize ""The Best of Me"" as the most synthetic hairball that Hollywood has coughed up since--well since the previous adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel.Before he was a best-selling romance novelist Sparks was a pharmaceutical salesman and hes still peddling drugs. This particular placebo is about high school sweethearts who are separated by tragedy and then reunite for a funeral 20 years later. Amanda (played as an adult by Michelle Monaghan) is married to a cartoonishly insensitive stockbroker (Sebastian Arcelus) and is preparing to send their son to college. Dawson (James Marsden) never married and he spends his nights on a Gulf Coast oil rig gazing up at the stars and dreaming of his lost love. Soon after a miraculous vision of Amanda saves Dawsons life in a boiler explosion he receives word that an old friend has died. Tuck (played by Gerald McRaney in the flashback sections) was the widowed mechanic who sheltered teen Dawson (Luke Bracey) when his meth-dealing pappy (Sean Bridger) thought the boy was getting too uppity with all that book-learnin.Tucks bayou cottage is where dirt-poor Dawson wooed rich girl Amanda (Liana Liberato) and in his will Tuck wants the two estranged lovers to divvy his property. So they are forced to reunite in the countryside where Amanda sees that Dawson is hunkier than ever when hes bent over the hood of a hot rod. (On the other hand Marsden -- who inherited the part after Paul Walker died -- doesnt look a thing like Bracey an Australian actor who seems to be twice as old as tiny tousle-haired Liberato.) The backstory of how the lovers were separated which involves the death of an innocent bystander is only the second dumbest turn of events in this utterly phony flick. The real whopper is saved for the final few minutes when yet another character is sacrificed on the bonfire of banalities.Sparks would be delighted if this movie were compared to his other story about reunited lovers but compared to ""The Notebook"" ""The Best of Me"" is the coffee-stained outline of a sales pitch for sleeping pills.What ""The Best of Me""  One star out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 157  Content sexuality violence some drug content and brief strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Photo Relativity Media MOVIE REVIEW The Best of Me Running time 188 minutes. Rated PG-13 (language sexual situations). At the Empire 34th Street others. When the Kindle first came out people found it liberated them to read trashy books free of neighborly judgment. There should be a similar bag-over-the-head disguise given to viewers of Nicholas Sparks movies which traffic shamelessly in a set of romance tropes reassembled slightly each time. Luke Bracey and Liana Liberto star as young Dawson and Amanda in the flick.Photo Gemma LaMana Youll have your hero who does manual labor by day and reads serious books by night (here its James Marsden on an oil rig with a Stephen Hawking tome). Therell be a free-spirited young woman with at least one rich mean parent whose love will burn for him despite their cruel separation (this one is Liana Liberato who grows up into Michelle Monaghan their sole shared resemblance a long mane of wavy hair). And dont get me started on the gorgeous bayou houses the handwritten letters the post-coital breakfasts on wraparound porches. The sunlight never glaring always dappled. The particulars in ""The Best of Me"" for what its worth are that teen sweethearts Dawson (initially Luke Bracey who looks craggier than the Marsden he grows up into) and Amanda (Liberato/Monaghan) are reunited after two decades by the death of an old friend (Gerald McRaney). Through a lawyer he asks them to come to his house and scatter his ashes. Shes unhappily married; hes just cheated death after an explosion on the rig. You get the feeling something just might start up between them again. It seems that the spark is still there for Dawson (Marsden) and Amanda (Monaghan).Photo Gemma LaMana Via flashback we see their early-90s selves falling in love despite his dirtbag abusive dad (Sean Bridgers) and her condescending country-club one. Dawsons taken in by a kindly old coot named Tuck (McRaney) who becomes the father he never had. But tragedy strikes; the lovers are torn apart. When they meet up again shes chilly -- but her eyes still light up at the sight of him in a motor oil-stained tee. Like the artificially sweetened junk food it is this all goes down pretty easily. Bracey makes a winning greaser type and you root for the couple. But neither really has any edge Theyre fundamentally nice people to whom bad things happen and that makes them sympathetic but not all that interesting. The films final act does make one surprising move which is to completely out-schmaltz itself. Director Michael Hoffman once made the great comedy ""Soapdish"" so he must get why audiences will be giggling rather than choking up -- which is the reaction I imagine Sparks intended as he wrote the scene longhand by candlelight on his wraparound porch.

Comments click to enlarge The Best of Me Video Rated PG-13  117 minutes  2014 To satisfy the dying wish of an old friend two former high school sweethearts (Michelle Monaghan James Marsden) reunite at a secluded cabin after 20 years apart; shes a rich housewife married to a dopey-looking businessman and hes a hunky oil-rig worker whose criminal relatives want him dead. That may sound like the premise for a Russ Meyer movie but this is adapted from a romance novel by Nicholas Sparks so all the laughs are unintentional. Director Michael Hoffman whos seen better days (Restoration Game 6) delivers the glossy perfume-ad aesthetic one expects from this sort of thing.

James Marsden plays Louisiana oil rigger Dawson a noble six-pack roughneck who reads the works of Stephen Hawking and likes to gaze wistfully up at the stars. Several hundred miles away Michelle Monaghans disillusioned wife and mother Amanda is wondering where her life went off the rails. Could there have been something between them long ago? Suddenly were flashing back to 1992 where a pair of fresh-faced school kids played by twentysomething actors who look absolutely nothing like their present-day counterparts fall crazy in love. But will Dawsons scenery-chewing redneck family scupper this burgeoning romance? Its entirely possible that the lead characters name is a sly in-joke on Sparkss part because the flashback scenes here are so unnervingly redolent of turn-of-the-millennium teen TV weepathon Dawsons Creek that you half expect James Van Der Beek and his Mount Rushmore forehead to come blundering in at any moment. It all comes to a head with the most woefully misjudged jaw-on-the-floor last-act twist in recent cinema history - which is saying something. Movies this silly crass and manipulative really shouldnt be allowed to exist in 2014. But were guiltily glad that they do.
