Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson are Chon and Ben Californian entrepreneurs whose special brand of weed has made them counterculture icons. Chon is a former soldier Ben is a cowardly trustafarian and theyre both - happily - in love with O (Blake Lively) a blonde mother-sister-surfer-whore type who gives both these overgrown adolescents all the love sex and attention they could possibly need. Thats until shes snatched by sadistic Mexican drug lieutenant Lado (Benicio Del Toro) on the orders of temperamental kingpin Elena (Salma Hayek).This is the scrappy happy Stone of U-Turn rather than the arch-satirist of W or the dogmatic documentarian of South of the Border. Savages can be a lot of fun particularly when Del Toro and Hayek are allowed to chew the scenery - youll not find Mexican villains this sleazy and grotesque outside of soap opera. Stones political instincts arent entirely suppressed - a deconstruction of the drug war arrives in the form of corrupt DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta) while a troubling torture scene riffs on black-ops rendition.But too much of the film feels tired. Kitsch and Johnson are game but their buddy-buddy shtick involves zero chemistry and neither character is remotely likeable. Lively is a bore she delivers a series of cod-poetic voiceovers like a bored Valley girl reading a Hallmark card. Stone revs his engines and chucks in some off-kilter angles a few film-stock shifts and a handful of noisy bloody shootouts but it all smacks of trying too hard to mask the absence of strong material. The result is not nearly savage enough.

What I know about the internecine workings of Mexican drug cartels you could fill in an egg cup--and still have enough space left over for the egg. But this I know Its a subject and a subculture that has got to be more fascinating than anything in gonzo director Oliver Stones deadly hateful preposterous and cliche-riddled movie Savages. He even makes the violence look dull. Based on one of those Don Winslow carnage epics that appeal to grown men who still read comic books Savages boogies to the beat of an assault weapon cutting back and forth between the cold-blooded drug lords in Tijuana and the stoner gringos of Southern California fighting it out for billions in the Baja Peninsula. The convoluted plot which would be difficult to decipher with the aid of a microscope is as familiar as any one of a thousand cable network television series--and Mr. Stones dialogue is as wooden as a rocking chair possibly because his script was co-written by the dubious Shane Salerno (Alien vs. Predator) and novelist Don Winslow whose grasp of the way real people talk is as phony as reality TV. The American potheads unconvincingly depicted as tattooed hunks with romantic notions of Butch and Sundance on reefer are Chon (camera-ready Taylor Kitsch who keeps stalling his PR-funneled elevator to pop stardom by pushing the down button) and Ben (Aaron Johnson the British star of such monumental motion picture milestones as Kick-Ass). Best friends since high school Chon is a combat veteran who worked as a Navy seal in Iraq starting the business by smuggling cannabis seeds from Afghanistan and Ben is a soulful Berkeley graduate who invests his share of lucrative profits from the weed trade in noble world causes. Together in Laguna Beach they share tattooed washboard abs and cuddle up in the same bed with a bottle blonde named O (Blake Lively). Its a perfect soft-core porn arrangement (lots of nipples but no real nudity) until their wacked out menage a trois is rudely interrupted by greedy and villainous drug lords from  south of the border ruled by Goth queen Elena (Salma Hayek in a tossable wig of lacquered bangs looking like a cross between Louise Brooks and Cleopatra) and her depraved henchman the psychopath Lado (Benicio Del Toro who has traveled down this homicidal highway before in better films than this). The best smoke in the world apparently is not from Thailand Jamaica or Saigon but mass produced in Chon and Bens pot factory a foundation with branches in Africa Asia and West Hollywood. Elena and her ruthless gang want a piece of the boys 15 million satisfied customers by forcibly encouraging them to join the Mexican work force but when they resist (opting to retire and--are you ready?--invest their illegal fortune in solar energy) she kidnaps O and threatens to cut off her fingers one by one. In retaliation the boys kidnap Elenas beloved daughter and war erupts. Stirring the pozole is Dennis a creep from the Drug Enforcement Agency who plays both sides against each other rejoicing in the ensuing brutality and torture. Dennis is played with demented glee by John Travolta who looks like a Pleistocene Era warthog. They are all savages and when Mr. Stone runs out of ideas about what to do with them he borrows every crime-thriller cliche from Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction to Tony Scotts Man on Fire bathes the bloody decapitations and rapes in the glow of lush cinematography then distracts the viewer with camera tricks black-and-white conversions cell-phone images classical music and finally a maddening finale narrated by O. Then the movie backs up like a VHS tape on rewind and theres an alternate cop-out ending even more infuriating than the first. Mr. Kitsch is pretty despite the unnecessary battle scars on his face designed to illustrate character but signifying nothing more than the hours he spent in the makeup chair. Mr. Johnsons changing moral compass from pacifist to killing machine is as contrived as Mr. Travoltas epiphany from invulnerable monster to sympathetic family man. Ms. Hayek as the Mother Goddam of the Mexican drug cartel is the best thing in the movie. To be fair the actors all work hard to keep the audience awake but the sloppy direction and drugged-out script make Savages hard to rise above. Continuity and logic have never been Oliver Stones strengths but this movie is barely credible. What makes drug lords hard to arrest is their unexceptional ordinariness. In real life they all look like plumbers and accountants. The predators here are so beautiful and exotic and camera-ready that any law enforcement officer with half a brain would have no trouble spotting them a block away. Worse still theyre boring. They blow off their victims kneecaps and you dont even notice. These are neither good people nor interesting savages and theyre not worth caring about. Neither is the movie. rreedobserver.com SAVAGES Running Time 130 minutes Written by Shane Salerno Don Winslow and Oliver Stone Directed by Oliver Stone Starring Aaron Johnson Taylor Kitsch and Blake Lively 1/4 Comment Filed under Aaron Johnson Benicio Del Toro Blake Lively Don Winslow Drug Cartel marijuana movie Movie Review Oliver Stone Pot Selma Hayek Taylor Kitsch Weed Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://observer.com/2012/07/savages-rex-reed-oliver-stone-taylor-kitsch-aaron-johnson/,200,savages(2012)2,savages(2012),com/2012/07/savages-rex-reed-oliver-stone-taylor-kitsch-aaron-johnson/

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 6 2012 Save for later Saved Savages actor John Travolta (l.) makes a cameo as a corrupt DEA agent. Francois Duhamel/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Oliver Stone is back in form with ""Savages"" which will be good news only to those who liked Stones form to begin with. Based on the acclaimed 2010 novel by Don Winslow its about a pair of extremely successful southern California pot growers the blonde bimbo they share and the vicious Mexican cartel that wants into the business. I suppose you could call it Stones version of ""Jules and Jim"" plus beheadings torchings bombings and strafings.Chon (Taylor Kitsch) is an ex-Navy SEAL and his partner in crime is Ben (Aaron Johnson) who is as hang-loose as Chon is hot-wired. Together theyve built up a vast business derived from Afghanistan cannabis seeds that are exponentially more potent than the competitions. Ophelia (Blake Lively) or O as she likes to be called is their mutual love object. She likes being in the middle of the men. ""For me"" she says ""they are one big man."" O fittingly is kidnapped by the cartel while shopping in the mall.Its ironic that Stone whose scripts for Alan Parkers ""Midnight Express"" and Brian De Palmas ""Scarface"" were a big influence on Quentin Tarantino should have made a movie that seems like a Tarantino spin-off. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The torture quotient is high and the human consequences cartoonish. ""Savages"" does keep the eye engaged if not the mind. Salma Hayek in a Cleopatra wig has an over-the-top turn as the cartels leader and Benicio Del Toro looking more toothsome than usual plays her henchman a man so ruthless hes well amusing. (Truly bad guys are always more fun than bad guys.) John Travolta has a pungent cameo as a corrupt DEA agent. The 50 best movies of all time Video Savages clip Monitor Movie Guide ""Savages"" isnt about anything except flashily directed mayhem. In this nest of vipers its the slitheriest varieties that survive - at least for a time.

The film follows a pot-growing threesome as they wage war against a Mexican drug cartel. Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern Updated July 5 2012 540 p.m. ET One of the two men in the menage a trois at the heart of Oliver Stones ""Savages"" wants to get out of the business of selling high-grade dope and into renewable energy. Hes already in it though. The movie renews the energy of depleted themes--drug violence drug wealth California dreaming Mexican cartels--and regenerates the career of Taylor Kitsch who gives the menage its strong ostensibly steely side. The violence is graphic the dialogue can be awfully arch and the style is often mannered but this long dense adventure takes surprising side trips into thoughtfulness ruefulness whimsy and romance. Its high-grade entertainment sustained by a buoyant spirit. ENLARGE Taylor Kitsch Blake Lively and Aaron Johnson in Savages. Universal Studios The trilateral love commission with its overtones of Butch Sundance and Etta (or for that matter Jules Jim and Catherine) is comprised of Mr. Kitschs Chon Aaron Johnsons Ben and Blake Livelys O as in Ophelia--""the bipolar basket case"" she explains helpfully ""who committed suicide in Hamlet. "" O further explains that Chon is cold metal Ben is warm wood and together they make one man. That contrast diminishes as time goes by; both men change in substantial ways. (The supercharged script was adapted by Shane Salerno Mr. Stone and Don Winslow from Mr. Winslows novel.) At the outset though Chon a Navy SEAL veteran of Iraq and Ben a Berkeley graduate with degrees in business and botany seem very much as O describes them. Partners in a Southern California enterprise that promotes--at least for them--better living through botany they grow and distribute weed of such legendary quality that a powerful cartel from south of the border offers big benefits in exchange for part of their product. Its an offer they cant refuse but they refuse it all the same a decision that changes the threesomes fate. While the savagery of ""Savages"" first emanates from the cartel the story tracks the increasingly desperate measures that Chon and Ben take to secure the safety of the woman they adore and to exact sweet revenge. After two flops not of his own making--""John Carter"" and ""Battleship""--Mr. Kitsch makes Chon a man of few words and deep feelings a knight of honor who reminded me of Russell Crowes Bud White in ""L.A. Confidential."" Mr. Johnson portrays Bens quirks and complexities with an admirable absence of comment--the glib idealism that has him touting the potential of a 10 solar panel in rural Africa the wimpiness that leads him to see the Mexican thugs as businessmen rather than the savages Chon sees. (The movie is tough on liberal optimism.) Ms. Livelys first task is to be as beautiful and seductive as O must be to keep her two guys hungry and happy; she is that and then much more when events test Os talents as a survivor. John Travolta is an American drug enforcement agent of fungible integrity; the actor plays the relatively small role with hardly a trace of the florid tropes he often favors. Benicio Del Toros Lado is a savage impure and simple who can make cutting a steak seem ominous; give him a nail gun and hed be as malign as Javier Bardems Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men."" The movies great surprise and delight is Salma Hayeks Elena a svelte monster with a Cleopatra haircut who runs the cartel. Ms. Hayek gives a showstopper of a performance in a shrewdly conceived role not because her Elena is given to flashiness but because shes quick-witted scarily focused improbably droll and--the biggest surprise of all--capable of genuine human feeling. Thats evident in the movies best scene when Elena and O come face to face as captor and captive and O revealing a sweetly banal attitude toward life rambles on about her days at a community college and her charmed existence with Chon and Ben. ""Do Americans always talk like that?"" Elena asks when O finally subsides. ""Do you ever think about the future?"" Her questions arent meant to be hostile. Shes genuinely baffled by this golden child and touched by the motherly instincts that Os tenderness provokes. ""Savages"" which was shot by Dan Mindel is all over the place stylistically--its spirit is so inclusive as to welcome brightly lighted recollections of ""Beach Blanket Bingo."" And the runtime is too long by at least 10 of its 130 minutes. (A character played by Uma Thurman was reportedly excised.) Thats not a surprise in an Oliver Stone production Mr. Stones filmmaking energies have always resisted safe containment. But his direction is nicely loose when its not action-taut; theres a playfulness that seems to say What the hell lets let things take whatever course they need to take. Its an unlikely formula for success. The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone star in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Watch a clip of the film. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures. A full appreciation of ""The Amazing Spider-Man""--theres plenty of fancy action to appreciate--requires not only a willing suspension of disbelief but a suspension of memory. The truly amazing thing is that most of what happens to Peter Parker in the first half of the film has already happened in previous chapters of the Spidey saga. Some differences exist to be sure. Peter is played by a different actor--Andrew Garfield instead of Tobey Maguire. Instead of being bitten by a single spider hes now munched on by several. But he gets the same lecture on responsibility from Uncle Ben goes through the same grief over Bens fate discovers the same superpowers in belabor-intensive ways invents the same uniform and mask. This hugely elaborate production is supposed to be the reboot of a foundering franchise but rebooting a computer wipes the silicon slate clean. In the movie whats old is old again. Whats new comes courtesy of technology. Spideys webslinging has been upgraded to spectacular laserlike marksmanship. The flying sequences in unexceptional 3-D have Spider-Man swooping swinging and soaring around midtown Manhattan with ever greater maneuverability. Yet even these blessings of the digital domain are mixed. Theyre oddly joyless demonstrations of hypergymnastics extravagant motion with meager emotion. ENLARGE Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man. Columbia Pictures At one point in fact the movie completely blows an opportunity for airborne wonderment. Its the moment when Peter/Spidey takes his girlfriend for her first cobwebbed ride. (Her name is now Gwen not Mary Jane and shes played by Emma Stone not Kirsten Dunst.) Secretly together in her bedroom they want to leave the apartment without her parents knowing hes been there so they leap out of the window Gwen hanging on to him for dear life. Yet we never get to see her reaction let alone experience the plummeting descent and presumed upswoop from her point of view The next shot shows nothing but two tiny dots swinging past the camera at the end of a very long web. The director Marc Webb presides over many elisions and lapses. We dont see the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) into the giant mutant known as the Lizard; the process starts in a taxicab but the next thing you know the Lizard is scaling the Williamsburg Bridge in all his enormous monstrosity. (Smaller lizards start swarming around the city but the story loses track of them just as it loses track of a villainous scientist played by the splendid Indian actor Irrfan Khan.) Peter needs to penetrate the inner sanctum of a supposedly impenetrable laboratory where deadly pathogens are being manufactured so he simply goes online does a quick bit of Googling gets the info he needs slips into the lab and wanders around unnoticed. Gwen a student at the high school Peter attends--they both look old enough for doctoral programs--conveniently works at the lab when she isnt in class. ENLARGE Andrew Garfield Jamie Trueblood/ (c) Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection Related Speakeasy Andrew Garfield Pulls Off Spider-Mans Mask Theres a sense of filling time with lame contrivance. In a convenience store Peter witnesses an argument about a penny that offends common sense. When it looks like Spidey is too weakened to prevail in the climactic battle with the Lizard everything pauses for a dopey interlude in which all the construction cranes on Sixth Avenue position their booms at a 90-degree angle so Spidey can swing from one to the next with greater ease on his trip uptown or maybe downtown. Yet the mystery that sets the plot in motion--what happened to Peters parents after they disappeared--is never resolved. (This Uncle Ben is played by Martin Sheen while Aunt May is now played by Sally Field made up to look absurdly haggard. Blue-collar women wash their hair too.) The film does open the heros soul to more than the nerdiness and repression of earlier incarnations. Peter Parker is now given to rage scorn humor and romance though the ragged script--credited to James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves--gives the star little chance for emotional nuance. Which brings us back to the need for suspension of memory. If you can forget what you know about how appealing Mr. Garfield was in ""The Social Network""; about how sensationally witty Ms. Stone was in ""Easy A"" (she has been reduced to a foil for Peters moods and needs); about the excitement of sexual tension (theres almost none between Peter and Gwen); about the pleasures of well-crafted drama (scene after shaky scene drifts off tentatively) and about movies that deliver on their promises (this origin tale turns into a wait-for-the-next-episode tease) then you can watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" without a sinking sense of being gypped. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com ENLARGE DVD Focus Miss Bala (2011) The Mexican drug wars seen from Mexico entirely through the eyes of a beauty-contest winner. Laura (Stephanie Sigman) a 23-year-old innocent from Tijuana falls into the clutches of the Baja California narco gang that engineered her triumph. (The ironic title means ""Miss Bullet."") Gerardo Naranjo the filmmaker who wrote this shockingly powerful film with Mauricio Katz never insists on symbols--theres too much action and agonizing suspense for that--but its irresistible to see his heroine as a stand-in for her beautiful country increasingly a hostage to savage crime. Frida (2002) Salma Hayek produced and stars in this English-language feature directed by Julie Taymor about the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and her tumultuous love affair with the muralist Diego Rivera; hes played by Alfred Molina. The film is inventive and gorgeously colored from the opening shot of a peacock in a garden to later renderings of Kahlos paintings as tableaux vivants. But the script based on Hayden Herreras biography resembles Riveras murals--its writ large broad and flat with spasms of agitprop style that come together as heavily as the ox-yoke eyebrows on Fridas face. Easy A (2010) The movie that made Emma Stone a star. I know Im like a broken record in recommending it but this high-school comedy directed by Will Gluck from an elated and elating screenplay by Bert V. Royal hasnt received the respect or success it deserves. Ms. Stone plays Olive Penderghast an Ojai Calif. high-school student who goes to class in a bustier emblazoned with the scarlet A of an adulteress. How she reaches this point is a convoluted story and a hilarious one. Suffice it to say that Olive identifies intensely with Hester Prynne the outcast heroine of ""The Scarlet Letter."" --Joe Morgenstern Explore More Gleason Review Inspiration Off the Gridiron Jason Bourne Review Looping Old Loops Indignation Review Life and Love in the 50s Star Trek Beyond Review Boldly Going Where It Has Been Dont Think Twice Review Making It Up as We Go Lights Out Review Flickering Frights Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The film is impressive. It has a bit of the cinematic whoop-de-doo of his noxious Natural Born Killers in which serial killers became existential heroes celebrated for attaining absolute freedom. But the perspective is different wry but mournful the savagery never a kick. The senselessness of the carnage gets to you. You think It doesnt have to be this way. It is this way thanks to forces Stone explored in Wall Street Money Never Sleeps in which unfettered capitalism tore families apart. The principal family here is a surrogate one a menage a trois consisting of innovative marijuana growers Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and their rich girlfriend O (Blake Lively) short for Ophelia. (She narrates.) Ben insists he can run his business with minimal violence using some of the profits to do good works in Africa trusting to Chon -- a knotted-up Iraq war vet -- to employ force on the rare occasions its called for. Its a remarkably gentle arrangement. O loves both men opposites whose spirits can be said (if youll forgive the woo-woo) to commingle inside her. But business intrudes -- a video via the Internet from the Baja cartel starring a man in a skull mask and seven severed heads ""These guys were stupid. Be smarter."" The Mexican cartel wants a piece of the business in return for wider distribution of the dope. The local DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta) -- who takes money from all sides -- tells the boys ""Dont fuck with Wal-Mart. Embrace the change."" Fatted his hair thinning Travolta gives his first truly middle-aged performance and his best in years. His Dennis is amoral but not inhuman. He has kids to feed and a wife dying of cancer. Everyone has a family to support even the scariest assassin Lado (Benicio Del Toro) who doles out grisly punishments with chilling precision. Del Toros face is all dark hollows as if his coal-black eyes had scorched his own visage in the mirror. His boss Elena (Salma Hayek) took over the cartel after the deaths of her husband and sons. If this were a Quentin Tarantino movie the character would be camp a mythic revenger but Hayek gets the balance between public shows of power and private woe just right. Of her precious daughter the only family left she says ""Shes ashamed of me and Im proud of her for it."" Savages is based on a book by Don Winslow that reads like notes for the screenplay he co-wrote with Shane Salerno and Stone. (Theres a thank-you to Stone in the acknowledgements.) The plotting loosens in the second half but thats part of the films integrity The emotional crosscurrents force the melodrama off the usual tracks. Kidnapped by Elena the impatient entitled O doesnt stand on ceremony. She gets close to her captor to the point where Elena almost -- almost -- treats her like a daughter. But if the characters recognize their common humanity it doesnt stop them from killing. As Ben the idealist does ghastly things to save O and the carnage ramps up you feel an infernal machine at work. Its business. Theres a weird two-fer ending by the way The books finale and one more on top of it. Its a puzzler but not a letdown. How do you resolve a movie as irresolvable as Savages without seeming glib? This way the high-as-a-kite way. An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified Shane Salerno as Steve Salerno.

Comments click to enlarge Savages Video Rated R  130 minutes  2012 A brutal Mexican drug cartel tries to muscle in on the booming pot business of two Laguna Beach dudes (Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson) whose partnership includes a laid-back menage-a-trois with a bronzed So-Cal beauty (Blake Lively); when the Americans refuse to cooperate the Mexicans kidnap the woman and threaten to behead her. The movie marks Oliver Stones return to the hyperbolic drug thrillers of his early screenwriting career (Midnight Express Scarface) and the dualistic protagonists--Kitsch an Iraq War veteran helps Johnson a genial hippie find his inner beast--are heavily reminiscent of Platoon (though the script was adapted from a novel by Don Winslow). The real schism here however is between the brainless fun of the action plot and Stones cheap exploitation of the cartels real-life sadism.

Francois Duhamel/Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Universal Studios Savages Director Oliver Stone Genre Crime and Mystery Thriller Running Time 131 minutes Rated R for strong brutal and grisly violence some graphic sexuality nudity drug use and language throughout With Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson Benicio Del Toro Emile Hirsch Blake Lively In English and Spanish with subtitles Watch Clips From Savages - Deals Not Offers Deals Not Offers Credit Universal Studios From Savages - I Made You I Made You Credit Universal Studios From Savages - Love Story Love Story Credit Universal Studios Often Im asked ""Whats the worst movie ever made?"" and I say ""I dont know but my own least favorite is Oliver Stones Natural Born Killers."" The early script by Quentin Tarantino was heavily revised and the final film became a celebration of serial killers now existential heroes with absolute freedom. Beyond the bombardment that was Stones direction the worldview was abominable. The thriller Savages is in the same brutal druggy realm of Natural Born Killers but Stone has evolved in the past decade and a half and the new film has a deeper more complicated perspective. The violence isnt a kick. Its horrifying senseless. Amid the mayhem you think ""It didnt have to go down this way."" Why does it? Business. That was the point of Stones last film Wall Street Money Never Sleeps -- that business could ravage anything even family. The family in Savages is surrogate but ideal. Its a menage a trois two buddies Chon and Ben and their rich California girlfriend O short for Ophelia who narrates. Their business is growing marijuana innovative strains of it using part of their profits to build villages in Africa. Aaron Johnsons Ben is the idealist Taylor Kitschs Chon the angry haunted Iraq War vet; the men are opposites loved equally by Blake Livelys O because together she tells us they form the perfect whole. Its a remarkably gentle arrangement until harsh reality intrudes in the form of a video e-mail sent from the Baja cartel in which a man in a skull mask displays seven severed human heads. The Mexicans demand a share of Chon and Bens business in return for giving them wider distribution -- and the corrupt local DEA agent Dennis played by John Travolta thinks their course of action should be a no-brainer. Pot-bellied with thinning hair Travolta gives his best performance in ages as a man whos thoroughly amoral but not inhuman. Hes a realist and the reality he thinks is that the war on drugs is insane and breeds more insanity. He rationalizes taking a piece of everything because he has kids to support and a terminally ill wife. Every character talks about his or her family even the scariest the Mexican assassin Lado played with demonic gravity by Benicio Del Toro his face all black hollows. Lados boss Elena is played with relish by Salma Hayek in a jet-black Prince Valiant wig. Elena took over the cartel after the deaths of her husband and sons and says of her daughter the only family left ""Shes ashamed of me and Im proud of her for it."" To get Chon and Ben to cooperate she has Lado steal what they love best -- O a kidnap victim just mouthy and entitled enough to appeal to Elenas motherly instincts. Are Ben and Chon more in love with each other? Its not clear since they pull out all the stops to get O back. Even Ben the humanitarian will do anything no matter how ghastly for the sake of his family. Savages is based on a book by Don Winslow that reads like notes for the screenplay he co-wrote with Shane Salerno and Stone. The narrative gets looser as the movie goes on the characters mixed-up emotions forcing the melodrama off its tracks. But the melodrama comes back with a vengeance an infernal machine that cant be turned off. Stone the cackling nihilist of Natural Born Killers is now Stone the tragic romantic.

"Young Savages have nothing on Hayek Travolta and Del Toro |       NJ.com comments Young Savages have nothing on Hayek Travolta and Del Toro Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 06 2012 at 808 AM View/Post Comments Francois DuhamelBenicio Del Toro is an example of whats right with this movie other bright spots being Salma Hayek and John Travolta. Blake Lively at left doesnt fare as well. Oliver Stones ""Savages"" is a movie about border-crossing drug-dealing criminals and its got great performances from a beautiful actress and two scene-stealing actors. Unfortunately theyre the supporting players. Thats because the stars here are Blake Lively Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson. The boys are high-end dope dealers who run afoul of a Mexican cartel; the girl is their shared romance. Sort of ""Jules and Jim"" -- and joints. Except that theres nothing to these people. Livelys heroine is particularly vapid. (Kidnapped at one point she whines to her captors that itd be nice if they gave her some salad once in awhile. Also some marijuana.) Her lovers if anything are even less developed emotionally and dramatically never moving beyond an initial ""Hes the brain/Hes the brawn"" setup. Even by the end Johnson is still a pothead poser Kitsch a lunkhead loser. Oddly though theres another trio here -- John Travolta Salma Hayek and Benicio Del Toro. And theyre terrific. Travolta -- minus his toupee plus some poundage -- is a clownishly corrupt DEA agent trying to play several sides at once. Del Toro is a similarly untrustworthy criminal selling people out compulsively. And Hayek is absolutely wonderful in a high-camp performance as the millionaire matriarch of a Mexican drug cartel dripping in diamonds and bullying worthless men with more relish than anyone since Joan Crawford hung up her anklestraps. These three pros are great but unfortunately theyre in a different movie. Actually there are a few different movies in ""Savages"" and most of them dont work. Theres that menage-a-trois romance -- which never evokes any real romance. And theres an ugly drug melodrama complete with chainsaws and literally eye-popping torture scenes. (Lets not forget that early in his career Stone wrote De Palmas ""Scarface."") But neither of those scenarios engages abandoning you to faint hope that a nostril-flaring cleavage-baring Hayek will flounce back. Or that the story will resolve itself -- despite the length things still feel rushed and confused. (An entire character played by Uma Thurman has been cut.) Yes there are some big explosions here and over-the-top villainy. And after recent more self-consciously ""serious"" filmmaking -- ""World Trade Center"" ""W."" the ""Wall Street"" sequel and a couple of leftish documentaries -- its nice to see Stone attempting a fierce frenetic thriller. But despite his typical tricks and tics -- hyperfast editing mixed-up film stocks -- this is more reminiscent of pulpy career low points such as ""U Turn."" The occasionally sharp tone of Don Winslows original novel has been lost and the films ending isnt much more than a joke. In an intentionally funny scene a disgusted Hayek -- an icy villain but the only real adult around -- sneers at the pot-addled Lively for being unable to concentrate. You wish she could step off the screen and give Stone a lecture as well. He needs to focus too and maybe return to the stripped-down straight-forward filmmaking of ""Salvador."" And Kitsch? After this -- and ""Battleship"" and ""John Carter"" -- he just needs to lay low. And maybe find a new agent. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence nudity sexual situations strong language and drug and alcohol abuse. Savages (R) Universal (127 min.) Directed by Oliver Stone.

Yes their girlfriend. Dont bogart that girlfriend dude. Starring Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson Blake Lively Salma Hayek Benicio Del Toro Director Oliver Stone Running time 210 Release Opened Jul 6 2012  Editorial Review Stones sign of the high timesBy Ann HornadayFriday July 6 2012There are two maybe three Oliver Stones the revisionist historian who drives Washington literalists batty with such lurid re-imaginings as ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" the straight-ahead mainstream auteur who limns the American experience in such magisterial dramas as ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Platoon"" and the all-to-the-wall hellion who extrudes that same experience through hallucinatory dreamscapes and lurid violence in genre films such as ""Natural Born Killers."" The snap crackle and pulp of Stones rock-and-roll inclinations fuels ""Savages"" his big bad boy of an adaptation of Don Winslows novel. A candy-colored black valentine to titillation garish brutality and groovy post-fin-de-siecle excess this ode to cinemas most exploitative pleasures finds Stone chronicling Americas dark side at its most sun-kissed. Drenched in light and sprawling across the screen in an anamorphic splash of wide-screen extravagance ""Savages"" is a B-movie striving for an A-plus a decadently energetic summer escape with bloody action bold visuals and bodacious attitude to burn. For filmgoers who can remember as far back as 2005 ""Savages"" could be described as the movie ""Domino"" tried so frenetically to be. With a filmmaker whos both a storyteller and a stylist at the helm material that in the earlier film fell victim to fatal incoherence here makes sense -- albeit depraved lightweight sense. As O (Blake Lively) explains in the detached So-Cal voiceover that threads through the film she has been living in a blissed-out menage a trois in Laguna Beach with Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Johnson) marijuana dealers who grow the the best product in the country commanding up to 6000 a pound. When they come into the sights of a Mexican cartel run via Skype and sadistic torture by a savvy leader called Elena (Salma Hayek bewigged to resemble Uma Thurman in ""Pulp Fiction"") they become embroiled in a battle that will ultimately involve Elenas chief enforcer Lado (Benicio Del Toro) and Chon and Bens most important U.S. contact Dennis (John Travolta). As zoned-out as Livelys voice and on-screen performances are theyre arguably well-suited to O a drifting privileged California girl whose heedlessness turns out to mirror some issues in Elenas own life. And it takes the latter character to observe the real romantic dynamics behind the threesomes idyllic housekeeping arrangement the push and pull between Chon -- a former Navy SEAL still haunted by what he saw in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and Ben a progressive pacifist who uses his ill-gotten gains to bring laptops and solar cells to Africa. ""Bens a Buddhist. Chons a Baddist"" O says in her narration underlining the contradictory tensions that Stone emphasizes throughout ""Savages."" Casting Ben and Chons struggle as a mom-and-pop operation (okay mom-and-pop-and-pop operation) against a big-box store the director manages to make an otherwise throwaway crime story chime with real-time politics from the recession to the recent victory of the Institutional Revolutionary Pary (PRI) in Mexico. Of the films three protagonists only Ben -- played with wide-eyed vulnerability and warmth by Johnson -- develops any real dimension. Still if the pretty but vacant members of the central trio never come fully into focus the films supporting players jump out with explosive often hilarious vividness. Travolta and Del Toro especially make the most of their characters finally coming together in one of the movies funniest scenes. The perversities predilections and pitiless viciousness that drive ""Savages"" arent for the faint of heart -- and a provocative switcheroo in the third act will certainly draw mixed reactions -- but those who partake of the cinematic substances on offer are likely to catch a strong if immediately forgettable buzz.Contains strong brutal and grisly violence some graphic sexuality nudity drug use and profanity throughout.

Photo Salma Hayek is the brains in the Mexican drug gang in ""Savages."" Watching Oliver Stones past few movies one couldnt help wondering whether the real story was the decadence going on behind the camera. I enjoyed ""Any Given Sunday"" for instance but its unexplained use of clips from the chariot race in ""Ben-Hur"" seemed like something somebody thought up at 4 a.m. after ingesting enough substances to stun a camel. With ""Savages"" though Stone lets the amoral drug-running degenerates on the screen handle the crazy for him keeping a cool hand and a steady eye. This Elmore Leonard-style noir about lowlifes versus dirtbags is nasty vicious fun. Peace-loving Ben (Aaron Johnson) and steely eyed Chon (Taylor Kitsch) grow some of the best weed in California if not the world. So a Mexican drug gang (muscle Benicio Del Toro brains Salma Hayek) offers to fold the boys ""indie"" business into the Baja cartels global concern. Ben and Chon can even keep 80 percent of the take. Moreover they enjoy the continuing support of a bought-and-paid-for DEA agent (John Travolta). Travoltas doughy cheerfully corrupt lawman is the most adorable sleaze in the picture. PHOTOS BLAKE LIVELY amp; OTHER GOSSIP GIRLS AND BOYS ON THE BIG SCREEN Ben and Chon do exactly what you or I would do when given a generous offer by men who buy machine-gun rounds by the shipload refuse and prepare to flee the country. But first though they tell their shared lover (Blake Lively) that theyll all live happily in Indonesia. This um joint girlfriend remarks that the situation is akin to the point in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" when the bandits take their lady friend to Bolivia. Didnt they die in the end? ""Well not the girl"" she remembers. Because she needs one last stroll through the mall to stock up on Manolos the little blond princess is captured thrown in a dungeon and held without even a subscription to InStyle. The girl subjects her captors to nonstop weapons-grade whining about how she deserves ""maybe a clean room at least maybe a salad once in a while."" And how are her jailers supposed to get any sleep with her phosphorescent teeth glowing all night like a supernova? The boys because brainless size-0 blondes are so scarce in the state of California scheme to get her back. Their next great idea is to make war on the gang shoot its desperadoes steal its money and use it to buy back the girl. Lets hear it for boyish exuberance. Chon does have a few tricks though Hes a veteran of the Iraq war where he learned how to build I.E.D.s and say things like ""Go Sunni on these bastards"" and ""May Allah be with you."" (Wait which side did he fight on in Iraq?) Though not quite up to the Leonard standard the tough-guy chatter is a delight as meaty and pulpy and pungent as a slab of beef thats been left out in the sun. Often the ruthlessness is wry even funny. ""Bury them like men -- whats left of them"" says Del Toro extra frightening with a molded poof of hair that makes him look like an alcoholic country-western singer in 1978. He tells an assistant henchman in the last words the unfortunate underling will ever hear ""It didnt work out. Youre too sensitive"" and remarks to another guy ""A man takes care of his family I respect that"" while dousing him with gasoline and putting a tire around his chest. Still on some odd occasions the writing sounds like Carrie Bradshaw. (On sex with a soldier ""I have orgasms he has war-gasms."" If one friend is a Buddhist the other is ""a bad-ist."") A lifetime ago Stone wrote ""Scarface"" whose extravagance bordered on camp but despite its excesses ""Savages"" is never unintentionally funny just gritty and mean. The run time is more than two hours yet its also tight no drag no waste no message.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 06 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 05 2012 712PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Oliver Stone Written by Shane Salerno Don Winslow Oliver Stone Starring Blake Lively Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson Salma Hayek Classification 18A Genre thriller Year 2012 Country USA Language English You really want to believe in Savages Oliver Stones resurrection as a disreputable pulp director. With its drained-out greasy colour scheme and arsenal of visual tricks sexual kink and Itchy and Scratchy cartoon violence his new film is intended to signal the 65-year-old directors return to the amoral trippy filmmaking of Natural Born Killers and U Turn rather than the journeyman professional who gave us World Trade Center and Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. Watch Savages the official trailer So why does Savages feel so calculated cutesy free of suspense and trashy only in the uninteresting sense? No doubt Stone is trying. Savages is diligently whipped together from Don Winslows bestseller with juddering hand-held shots and spasms of black-and-white and computer imagery but it all feels more like flexing atrophied muscles rather than creating a believable experience.The first misstep is the casting. Theres Blake Lively as Ophelia Sage a.k.a. ""O"" (can Oprah sue for copyright infringement?) with her tangled tresses slack smile and Lauren Bacall hooded eyes. Her opening voice-over with its strained post-Buffy jokes (a beheading is someone ""going Henry VIII"") is Gossip Girl after graduation.Then theres Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson as her superbuff Abercombie amp; Fitch duo of lovers with whom she shares a Laguna Beach home. Chon (Kitsch) is a former Navy SEAL who brought some magic marijuana seeds back with him from Afghanistan. Ben (Johnson) is a sensitive genius botanist who has developed the weed strain into some killer THC content. We know this because O tells us so but the characters remain one-dimensional. We see a lot of them hanging around their lavish beachfront house in the tub or the pool taking turns with O (always partly dressed) while sampling their herb.Then whoa some heavy Mexican buzz-harshing cartel dudes contact them by Skype to show them some hideous al-Qaeda style videos of their enemies being decapitated and hung up on hooks to send them a message (complete with a sad-face emoticon). The Mexicans work for Elena (Salma Hayek) a pint-sized diva in plunging necklines and a Cleopatra wig who wants a piece of Ben and Chons business. When they show up for a meeting the Mexicans clean up good wearing suits and acting more like mall developers than gangsters It seems they want to buy into the boys high-grade pot action. As jumpy crooked drug-enforcement agent Dennis (John Travolta) explains the cartel is Wal-Mart and its out to absorb their boutique operation.The villainous Elena arranges for her right-hand psycho Lado (Benicio Del Toro) to kidnap O to make sure the boys capitulate. And naturally the crafty Ben and ruthless Chon pretend to go along with the demands while launching their own insurrectionist war against the cartels incursion.Stone typically isnt remotely subtle about his political points swipes at capitalism and references to the war on terrorism. Once Chon and Ben decide to cross the moral line theyre pecs deep into kidnapping torture improvised explosive devices - the whole desert war package all in sunny Southern California.Meanwhile poor O is kept in a cell where she is forced to eat pizza and watch episodes of The Bachelorette while Del Toro as her psychopathic guard under a pompadour as big as an armadillo keeps wiggling his eyebrows ominously. In her Tijuana palace Elena gets foot rubs from her maid talks in a Darth Vader-disguised voice to the gringo boys via Skype and threatens her underlings with extermination.As with most comic-book movies the apparently insurmountable problems are easily solved by superhero abilities. Chon and the squad of expert killers he has on speed dial can rip off the cartel hoods with ease. Bens computer genius buddy (Emile Hirsch in a small role) can falsify records and move money around the world with a click of a computer mouse. Although were supposed to feel the burden of Bens transformation from peaceful do-gooder to blood-soaked killer it feels as weighty as a puff of smoke.There is an intriguing war going on here but its conducted between two generations of actors. Those shameless middle-aged hams - Travolta who wheedles and sparks like Peter Lorre on meth Del Toro as an oozing sore of a reprobate and Hayek as a telenovela Lady Macbeth - cruelly blow the pretty trio of young stars off the screen. There are no good guys in Savages but only the really bad guys hold an iota of interest.

Photo Credit Francois Duhamel advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two pot dealers try to rescue their shared girlfriend from the clutches of a Mexican drug cartel. BOTTOM LINE Oliver Stones latest attempt at provocation is merely a post-toke daydream of sex and violence all hollow shock value and no depth. CAST Blake Lively Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson LENGTH 210 Oliver Stones ""Savages"" tells the story of two pot dealers whose shared girlfriend is kidnapped by a Mexican cartel. Given its mix of drugs sex capitalism and warfare I expected an incendiary combination of Stones ""Natural Born Killers"" ""Platoon"" and maybe even his politically perverse documentary ""South of the Border."" Instead ""Savages"" is a juvenile fantasy of bullets breasts and bongs -- not such a bad thing if Stone would just admit it and stop staging the film as a profound ethical wrestling match. Co-written by Stone Shane Salerno and Don Winslow (from his noirish jive-talking novel) ""Savages"" is so hollow and hypocritical that it cant even decide on an ending. Youll get more than one but its no bargain. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch (on dinger No. 3 this year following ""John Carter"" and ""Battleship"") play Ben and Chon boutique growers living in a Southern California bungalow with O (Blake Lively) whos as emptily erotic as her name. Everyone is let off any moral hooks Ben (Aaron Johnson) is a budding George Soros who improves African villages while muscleman Chon only kneecaps dirtbags who deserve it. But when the Baja cartel swoops in (John Travolta plays a corrupt DEA agent in the middle) do-gooder Ben finds himself forced to do bad. Stone tries to plumb the depth of these characters but theyre skin deep and alarmingly dumb. (""Dope is supposed to be bad"" says O ""but in a bad bad world its good."") Salma Hayek as drug honcho Elena Sanchez and Benicio Del Toro as Lado the worlds deadliest Mexican gardener are broadly entertaining but ""Savages"" never seriously addresses the real drug wars currently depopulating Mexico. The films mess-with-your-head finale meant as a clever fake-out is just a cop-out.

""Its been a four-year on-and-off effort"" Stone said. ""There are 10 one-hour episodes. Thats like making a 10-hour movie but in a classic documentary style."" Stone says that the series will be ""mainstream"" but that its not intended to reinforce what you think you already know about the countrys history since 1945.

Directed by Oliver Stone. Starring Blake Lively Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Two happy hunky dope growers love a gorgeous woman - agreeably gymnastically in the same beach house and often at the same time. Then shes kidnapped by a brutal Baja drug cartel with a flair for decapitation. The boys plot to get her back. People get shot. Cash gets stolen. Benicio del Toro playing a b-b-bad-to-the-bone Mexican killer glowers in close-up. So. What part of this is boring? All of it. Complain as loudly as you like about Oliver Stone - his politics posturing and relationship with the facts - but until now he hasnt directed a film thats flat-out dull. ""Savages"" isnt dull for lack of trying. Its dull because Stone a master of pugnacity and packaging has finally made a movie vacant of everything but style All those flashy graphics super-exposed colors and hyper-kinetic rewinds cant cover for a complete and utter dearth of real ideas. Theres just nothing going on under the cover. The script - by Stone Shane Salerno and Don Winslow from Winslows novel - is terrible. Its terrible in the macro (could the plot be less intelligible?) and in the micro (could a single line get any more brainless than ""I have orgasms he has wargasms?""). Emotions such as they are pitch from icy disinterest to hair-ripping sentimentality with barely time to pause in the middle for cynicism. The acting isnt bad but the characters as written boast roughly the depth and heft of a spork. The hunky marijuana boys are Chon (Taylor Kitsch) the damaged veteran and Ben (Aaron Johnson) the dreamy Buddhist with the bouncy hair and you could not find two less-interesting drug fiends anywhere in the movies. Their shared gal pal is O (Blake Lively) short for Ophelia but the feeble Shakespearean allusion matters less than the homage to Pauline Reages 1954 female-bondage novel ""The Story of O."" The film does all that we expect of a little ultraviolence shoot-outs squished eyeballs bare butts in the act of humping. Thank goodness for John Travoltas small snappish role as a complicated DEA agent. In his best scene he mixes it up with del Toro swaps threats and exhortations pleads a little yells a little mourns his dying wife and ultimately concludes ""You cant trust anyone any more""  Amy Biancolli is a Hearst movie writer.

Everything leads up to a pair of drawn-out climactic resolutions that seek to be all things to all people.This tale of a pair of California marijuana farmers-turned-millionaires and their shared Laguna Beach bunny never achieves the Pulp Fiction-style intrigue it aspires to amid vicious dealings with Mexican drug cartels kidnappings and endless double-crossings. VIDEO Hayek turns on the mean in SavagesMORE Red Carpet Report Savages LA premiereBased on Don Winslows fast-paced snarky novel the film waters down the edginess of his page-turner. It does however occasionally draw upon his too-cool-for-the-room prose stylings. Narrator Blake Lively (who plays O short for Ophelia) describes one of the two main protagonists as ""a Buddhist and the other as ""a Baddist.""O is the leggy blond gal pal of pot entrepreneurs Chon (Taylor Kitsch) who is a former Navy SEAL and Ben (Aaron Johnson) a peace-loving UC-Berkeley grad who uses some of his business proceeds to build schools in Third World countries. The two are best pals who formed a highly successful homegrown industry.They also share the affections of O. The story hinges on the premise that the two men polar opposites in outlook and ethics will do anything for her. But the ardor underlying their willingness to risk everything for her never feels convincing. And O is a vapid shopaholic who scarcely deserves their heroic efforts. In Winslows book the threesomes back stories are explained making their unusual relationship a tad clearer.About the movieSavages out of fourStars Taylor Kitsch Blake Lively Aaron Johnson Salma Hayek Benicio Del Toro John TravoltaDirectorOliver StoneDistributor Universal Pictures Rating R for strong brutal and grisly violence some graphic sexuality nudity drug use and language throughout Running time 2 hours 10 minutes Opens Friday nationwideSavages comes off as director Oliver Stone trying to rekindle his Natural Born Killers mojo from 1994. But when the bigger-name stars show up here in cartoonish roles things feel more silly than gritty.Benicio Del Toro plays Lado a nasty enforcer in a Mexican drug cartel run by the ruthless Elena (Salma Hayek). Shes a mega-powerful and vicious drug lord who cant get her college student daughter to return her calls. John Travolta plays a cynical DEA agent on the take. Johnson who is British is believable enough as a hippie weed grower and Kitsch is better in this hawkish role than in his earlier movies John Carter and Battleship (though thats not saying much). Lively doesnt do much but look miserable stoned or blandly smiley.When the Tijuana-based cartel demands that Ben and Chon partner with them a turf war ensues that while never boring also is never wholly convincing. When contrasted with tense and smart drug-running thrillers such as Traffic which also starred Del Toro Savages seems all the more flimsy and gratuitously lurid.While the cinematography is consistently striking the story ricochets among ironic humor brutal violence and awkward stabs at genuine emotion.While Savages aims for provocative and dynamic it comes off as predictable and strained.

"Review Oliver Stone overdoes the brutality in Savages - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Oliver Stone overdoes the brutality in Savages Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Its that kind of a story where things got so out of control"" says O the narrator of""Savages.""Shes talking about the plot but she might be talking about the filmmaking as well. Adapted from the bestselling Don Winslow novel ""Savages"" has a lot going for it including a pip of a story a propulsive narrative drive and the uber-cool blacker-than-night attitude and language of author Winslow who told one interviewer ""I dont know that Id want to visit my brain except with a gun and a flashlight."" Initially Oliver Stone is an asset as well (besides directing he has co-written the screenplay with Shane Salerno and Winslow). As a filmmaker hes often shown an affinity for ruthless people acting ruthlessly and theres a pulp side to his directing personality that meshes well with this self-consciously amoral story of a drug-dealing menage a trois facing off against a rapacious Mexican cartel. Leave the kids at home for this one. Please. PHOTOS Savages premieres in L.A. But Stone is also a director who has often felt that anything worth doing is worth overdoing and his weakness for bloody excesses of all sorts undermines much of his good work. You might not think that a motion picture called ""Savages"" could be too violent too savage but you would be wrong. Some of that material of course comes right from the book like the opening sequence of a homemade video put together by the Baja Cartel a group that makes up for in violence what it lacks in cinematic sophistication. The video shows what happens when the cartels decapitation squad has finished ""going all Henry VIII"" on some unfortunate rivals. That scene is intended for best friends Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) buddies since high school and Laguna Beach-based partners in a multimillion-dollar business that grows some of the best most potent marijuana in the world -- weed that sells for 6000 a pound to people who consider themselves lucky to get it. Filling us in on the details with lots of verbal style (""Laguna is where God parked himself on the seventh day"") is O short for Ophelia. Played by Blake Lively O lets us know that Ben is a mellow botanist who is into renewable energy while Chon is a former Navy SEAL with a hair-trigger temper who came back from combat ""with a lot of cash but no soul."" O also tells all about Ben and Chons sexual lives something she knows a great deal about because she shares a bed with both of them. ""Together they make one complete man"" she enthuses. ""They have one thing in common me."" Though no ones going to be winning any acting awards here Kitsch (""Battleship"") Johnson (John Lennon  in ""Nowhere Boy"") and Lively (""Gossip Girl"" ""The Town"") make this threesome as convincing as its going to be. The films starry-eyed idealization of the relationship has to be at least borderline believable in order for the essential contrast with the cartels cutthroat cynicism to be effective. Impressed by the potency of Ben and Chons weed the Baja Cartel intends to swallow their business whole. ""They are Wal-Mart"" someone tells the boys ""and they want you for a specialty aisle."" Ben and Chon reject the cartels offer and the drug lords retaliate by kidnapping O the only thing in the world that means anything to our heroes. The cartel refuses to let her go unless some very onerous demands are met. Do Bamp;C have what it takes to confront these scary and dangerous people and if they do what will going to war take out of them? Much of the juiciest acting in ""Savages"" comes from performers playing the storys more morally compromised characters. Salma Hayek does her best Wicked Witch of the West imitation as La Reina Elena head of the Baja Cartel and Benicio Del Toro all but oozes evil as Lado her enforcer. Best of all is John Travolta who gets it just right as Dennis a genially corrupt Drug Enforcement Administration agent.Though it could be argued that the violence and torture these people bring with them is essential to this kind of story there is a key difference between how the novel and the film treat the material.  In the book Winslows style is so hip that the violence though quite explicit is coolly held at arms length. Nothing is allowed to disturb the fabric of the writing. Stone on the other hand has a counterproductive tendency to get infatuated with violent extremes for their own sake. His weakness for what the Motion Picture Assn. of America calls ""strong brutal and grisly violence"" overpowers everything else at those overdone moments the tension in the scenario dissipates and you fall out of the movie. The story of  ""Savages"" is too strong to destroy even with key elements of the novels plot tampered with. But the hurt can be put on this material and thats what has happened here.

But this drug-war thriller is not nearly so feral as such previous Stone rampages as U-Turn and Natural Born Killers. Occasionally it even seems righteous. Adapted from Don Winslows 2010 best-seller Savages pits laid-back hedonistic Californians against brutal hegemonic Mexicans. The former are the happy Laguna Beach threesome of Chon Ben and O (Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson and Blake Lively); the latter are led by Tijuana-based Elena (a bewigged Salma Hayek) with Lado (a pompadoured Benicio Del Toro) as her north-of-the-border enforcer. In the middle is a doubly corrupt DEA agent (a balding John Travolta). Elenas cartel is being squeezed in Mexico so shes decided to hit a soft -- and lucrative -- target. Ben a botanical genius with a Bono-like taste for globe-trotting altruism cultivates ""some of the best weed in the world."" He doesnt like gangster tactics but he does have muscle His longtime pal Chon is a former Navy SEAL and Iraq war veteran. Both guys are sexually entwined with O the dope-loving party girl whos also the films narrator. Ben and Chon dont want to work for Elena and so are insufficiently deferential to her emissary (Demian Bichir Oscar-nominated last year for A Better Life). Initially they dont realize hes making them an offer they cant refuse. Elena listening in on the conversation is angered by their remarks. (Apparently unconcerned about being traced characters in the movie regularly video-chat with each other and even send incriminating images of their brutal murders across the Net.) To assure the deal Elena has O kidnapped and demands a substantial ransom. With the help of their money launderer (an Emile Hirsch cameo) Ben and Chon try to raise the cash. When that doesnt work Chon calls his old battle comrades -- and the ""basically Buddhist"" Ben has to determine if he loves O enough to kill to get her back. This being an Oliver Stone movie his decision is not hard to anticipate. One inevitable irony here Stone and the film are on the Yanks side yet Hayeks and del Toros performances register more strongly than do the one-dimensional turns of Lively (petulant) Johnson (cool) and Kitsch (naked). i O (Blake Lively) Bens and Chons girlfriend has a not-so-friendly chat with Lado (Benicio Del Toro) an enforcer for the Tijuana cartel that kidnaps O to ensure a drug deal goes through. Francois Duhamel/Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Universal Studios O (Blake Lively) Bens and Chons girlfriend has a not-so-friendly chat with Lado (Benicio Del Toro) an enforcer for the Tijuana cartel that kidnaps O to ensure a drug deal goes through. Francois Duhamel/Universal Studios Savages is flashy in the directors usual manner with slow- and fast-motion footage lurid animations and sequences in washed-out or hypersaturated color. Unlike in some of Stones movies however these stylistic tics make a certain narrative sense. When the color drains from images of O for example that might signify her fate; early in the story she cautions that just because shes narrating the tale doesnt necessarily mean she survives it. This isnt one of Stones political films but it does offer parallels between the Iraq war and the narco one. In particular a grisly torture scene illustrates the argument made by critics of ""enhanced interrogation"" People subjected to horrific pain will say whatever they think their tormentors want to hear. When not questioning the ""war on terror"" Stone needles another rogue American institution the movie biz. The director furnishes Savages with multiple outcomes as if to mock those Hollywood test-screening audiences who always seem to want a happy ending. With a boost from Jeff Lynnes ""Do Ya"" the filmmaker delivers one. Its not enough to justify the movies sadism or its over-padded length. But the playful way Stone flips the mood demonstrates a command of the material he hasnt shown in more than a decade.

While I agree with a lot of Stones political opinions even at the nuttier edges I dont think his espousal of various left-wing causes is all that important when it comes to the goodness or badness of his films. (I can definitely live without the hero worship directed at Venezuelan despot Hugo Chavez displayed most embarrassingly in the 2009 documentary ""South of the Border."") Overall I much prefer Stone in his debauched libertarian pop-entertainer mode to his self-assigned role as dispenser of morality political wisdom and conspiracy theory.So heres what I can tell you about Stones new ""Savages"" Within the first five minutes youve got six or seven different kinds of imitation film stock (I assume its all done digitally these days) ranging from black-and-white perfume-commercial shots of a woman walking on the beach to homemade Mexican torture videos cacophonous layers of reggae and trance-pop and classical music at war with each other and a female narrator informing us that just because shes telling us the story doesnt mean she isnt dead. Adapted from a minimalist pulp novel by Don Winslow (who co-wrote the screenplay with Stone and Shane Salerno) this Southern California neo-noir with Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson as a couple of high-end pot growers who share the same blissed-out blond chick (Blake Lively) is on its most obvious level execrable racist softcore and sadistic tripe. But Im not claiming I didnt have a good time ""Savages"" is enjoyable in a way thats almost but not quite intentional camp; its like eating a dinner made by a 7-year-old with cake for every course interspersed with Jell-O Pepperidge Farm goldfish and chocolate sprinkles.After the hectoring tedium of his 2010 ""Wall Street"" sequel its a relief to discover that the pedal-to-the-metal balls-to-the-wall drugged-up and lunatic Oliver Stone of ""U Turn"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""The Doors"" is not gone forever. Note that I am cleverly avoiding the question of whether those movies are actually any good although I will defend ""The Doors"" as an authentic American classic of its own idiotic sort. Like those three pictures ""Savages"" takes on the chaotic underside of the social revolution wrought in America during the 60s and 70s which is always Stones principal subject. Arguably hes still addressing the aftermath of the 60s in films that venture pretty far afield like ""W."" or ""World Trade Center"" and while ""Savages"" positions itself as an up-to-the-minute fable of the new millennium its very much set in the world the hippies of Stones generation made.For a straight male director Stone has always been exceedingly interested in showcasing sweaty young hunks to their best advantage and in ""Savages"" -- largely shot in extreme close-up by cinematographer Dan Mindel -- the homoerotic content gets cranked to 11. (Im not questioning Stones sexual orientation by the way; I think its just unusually overt male narcissism.) ""Gossip Girl"" star Blake Lively plays a beach-house rich-girl type just called O -- her real name is Ophelia which even she says is an overly obvious clue about her destiny -- who narrates most of the plot in voice-over. This is frequently necessary since Stone and his troika of editors have cut the film in what they must think is dazzlingly contemporary fashion but actually resembles an especially coked-up music video circa the George H.W. Bush administration. O is something like a shared lifestyle accessory second only to their beloved bong for ultra-macho ex-Navy SEAL Chon (Kitsch) and long-haired hippie-surfer dreamboat Ben (Johnson) who are the brawn and brains respectively behind an Orange County boutique weed-growing operation. (She refers to them as ""the Buddhist and the baddist."") Sometimes O gets it on with each of them separately but when the dope is truly outstanding they all end up in a big art-directed dogpile of lingerie tattoos and white-people dreadlocks. Ben and Chon are not quite depicted as being bisexual all over each other but pretty close. You Might Also Like Theres a heckuva lot of plot getting in the way of the story here to purloin a phrase from movie-critic Zen master Joe Bob Briggs most of it having to do with Ben Chon and Os bucolic cannabinoid Laguna Beach existence coming under attack from a sinister Mexican drug cartel (who speak among themselves conveniently enough in English). The good thing about Mexican drug cartels from a filmmakers point of view is that they do such awful things in real life that you pretty much get free rein to depict their members as a bunch of snakelike sadistic mexicano bastards with bad taste and Bettie Page wigs besides. OK only Salma Hayek sports such a wig in her tyrannous black-widow role; I suppose Benicio del Toros mariachi-band pompadour and Pancho Villa mustache are the real deal. In addition to those two we get Demian Bichir as a duplicitous suit-wearing lawyer a velvet glove over the iron fist. Its like a whos-who of terrific Latino actors all playing the most fearsome stereotypes.Very likely Stone and Winslow are making a point of some kind although I cant be sure (and Im not even sure its worth making). Its not like Ben and Chon and O arent also stereotypes of a different sort privileged and hedonistic gringos with a permanent sense of entitlement and no thoughts of the future. Theres a leaden intentional irony to Winslows title; both the Mexican and American characters view the other side as barbarians. When Elena Hayeks character has O kidnapped to enforce a bargain with Ben and Chon the two forge a tentative mother-daughter relationship mostly based on Elena lecturing O about how irresponsible and unladylike she is. But thats one of the few scenes in ""Savages"" where you can be fairly sure whats going on dramatically speaking. A lot of this movie has the feeling of an experimental film or a graphic-novel adaptation or say Richard Kellys ""Southland Tales"" where you feel like you didnt do the introductory reading and youre constantly scrambling to keep up. One thing I feel pretty sure about is that the plot of ""Savages"" is largely beside the point as is the massively irritating performance by John Travolta as a balding and corrupt DEA official. I watched this movie stone cold sober at a Manhattan press screening without benefit of Ben and Chons high-grade product and it still seemed closer to a drug trip -- part ecstatic fantasy part cautionary nightmare -- than to a normal three-act narrative. If this movies ""about"" something its about Kitsch and Johnson and Livelys luxuriant young bodies and the second-unit beach photography and watching stuff blow up in the desert and seeing a guy get tortured to death in a manner that would have shocked Torquemada. This isnt Oliver Stone in his didactic Dickensian mode but rather Oliver Stoned in search of Whitmanesque trash-culture transcendence. Heres a spoiler for you That initial question about whether O is alive or dead? Ive seen the whole movie and I still dont know. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 Theres a fine line between pulp and pretense with Oliver Stone. From his early directorial outing 1981s The Hand (Michael Caine loses his appendage but it comes back ferociously) to his 1991 hallucinogenic rock bio The Doors to his hyperactive homicidal-twosome movie 1994s Natural Born Killers Stone has a tendency to inflate what is essentially genre fare with grandiosity with portentous gab. More about Savages >> And when hes not busy rewriting history (Nixon W. JFK) or examining war (Platoon) or football (Any Given Sunday) or finance (Wall Street) or 9/11 (World Trade Center) the prolific filmmaker screeches his car wheels back onto B-movie turf drugs sex and guns. Which is where Savages adapted from the novel by Don Winslow comes in. Opening with ominously shaky video of masked goons and cowering hostages Savages is all about a trio of beautiful Laguna Beach pot dealers who run afoul of a Mexican cartel and of the DEA. But its also in a big way a love story of three bronzed So-Cal hedonists Ben (Aaron Johnson) Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and O (for Ophelia - played by Blake Lively) who live together in beachfront splendor happily toking drinking and menage-ing as the sun sinks gloriously into the sea. In fact before Benicio Del Toro (as the villainous cartel enforcer) and John Travolta (as a double-dealing Drug Enforcement agent) make their hambone entrances I thought Stone was redoing Truffauts Jules and Jim two guys and a girl love pulling them every which way. It is Livelys O who supplies the purple-prose voice-overs that run through (or run over) Savages starting with this canny conundrum ""Just because Im telling you this story doesnt mean that Im alive at the end of it. Its that kind of a story where things got so out of control. . . . "" A few more of Os bon mots ""Dopes supposed to be bad. But in a bad bad world its good."" And this one describing her sex life with Chon a veteran of several tours of Afghanistan - and the muscle so to speak in the outfit ""I have orgasms"" she says as we watch Chon and O acrobatically going at it. ""He has wargasms."" Subtlety has no place in this world this movie. Just watch Salma Hayek as Elena the boss behind the Mexicans. In her stiletto heels and jet-black Bettie Page do shes a Latina vixen - dealing out tarot cards and death sentences with equal ardor. When its time to hop the plane from Baja for a meet across the border she calls her destination Gringoland - with utmost contempt. And who knows if it was Del Toros idea or Stones but at a particularly crucial - and criminal - moment as a very bad thing is about to occur the actor twirls his mustache menacingly like a Mexican Snidely Whiplash. Yes Savages is that kind of story. Savages  (out of four stars) Directed by Oliver Stone. With Aaron Johnson Taylor Kitsch Blake Lively Benicio Del Toro Salma Hayek and John Travolta.

Its not at all for the faint of heart. The heroes are pot dealers -- pot entrepreneurs really -- and their interactions with a Mexican drug cartel that wants their business are as bloody as the headlines would have you believe. Heads get blown apart and eyeballs dangle. There are chainsaws. The operating assumption is that blowtorch hyper-realism is the only appropriate approach to this subject. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters The films based on the well-regarded crime thriller by Don Winslow (who had a hand in the script along with Stone and Shane Salerno) and its central irony is that two young dudes who could have become say website millionaires decided instead to go into the marijuana industry. Ben (Aaron Johnson) is the brains a Berkeley business/botany double major with an idealist streak; he plows his profits into Third World sanitation projects. Chon (Taylor Kitsch) is the muscle back from Iraq and Afghanistan with bad scars and worse memories. Their product with its 33 percent THC content is popular enough to let them live the Laguna Beach dream. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below And popular enough to attract a Baja group headed by Elena ""La Reina"" Sanchez (Salma Hayek) a chic Tijuana drug lord and noodgy mom. Ben and Chon get an offer from Elenas lawyer (Demian Bichir); added incentive is provided by Lado (Benicio del Toro) a paunchy grinning enforcer who goes about his bloody business accompanied by a landscaping crew. If del Toro werent in ""Savages"" it would be a much lesser film; the actor imbues his character with street smarts and sly cruelty and hes an old-school joy to watch. In a way Lado is a comic variation on Javier Bardems killer in ""No Country for Old Men"" and the best way to follow the storys switchbacks and double-crosses is to keep your eye on the fox. The other major character in ""Savages"" is O -- California shorthand for Ophelia -- who is Ben and Chons shared girlfriend and the films narrator filling us in on the details in a dreamy tone that lets us know shes not nearly as bright as she thinks. Another actress might have pressed harder on that unreliability but Blake Lively makes her limitations work for her; she plays O without playing down to her. (Only late in the film when Livelys required to emote the heavy stuff does she fall short.) ""Savages"" skips from one set-piece to the next each done with propulsive flair. Few can over-direct as engagingly as Stone; he gets cinematographer Dan Mindel to soak the visuals in rich decadent hues and he has three editors on hand I guess because theres so much cutting to be done. The film rockets along beautifully sustained not by its violence -- thats just a dealers cost of doing business -- but Stones incredulity that Ben and Chon could ever think it would be otherwise. There are moments of domesticity that leaven the movie with humor and soul. Johnson and Kitsch (whos had a bad year what with ""John Carter"" and ""Battleship"") create a compelling pothead Mutt and Jeff one gently naive the other itching for battle. They both love O but they love each other more with an honesty that sidesteps the usual movie panic about such things. When O is kidnapped by the cartel she becomes something of a surrogate child to Elena whose own daughter (Sandra Echeverria) wants nothing to do with her. Even the corrupt DEA agent played by an antic John Travolta has a sorry situation at home. Not that Stone wants us to feel bad for these people -- they all deserve whats coming to them. But the film successfully manages a double vision that lets us engage with the characters while standing at an amused horrified distance. For all Ben and Chons efforts to rescue O a few throwaway beach shots of willowy California blondes hint at how unremarkable she really is. The director is so intent on de-romanticizing this story that he ends up shooting himself in the foot. ""Savages"" builds to a climax that is parched and bloody and nihilistic more or less as in the book -- and then backtracks for a second ending that is patently ridiculous Stone thumbing his nose at us for bothering to care. But hes not the director for such meta-stunts; they call for a scalpel and Stone wields a hammer. When the screen briefly fades to white at a crucial point very near the end you might want to consider getting out while the going -- and the movie -- is still good.

Now we come to ""Savages"" a vaguely sleazy pulp drama that addresses those topics obliquely but is mainly filled with the directors other favorite things sex drugs and violence. In other words its vintage Stone albeit without as much cocaine-fueled editing as in say ""Natural Born Killers."" Based on Don Winslows 2010 novel and set in Laguna Beach Calif. ""Savages"" is the sun-baked story of two beach-bum friends Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) who run a simple marijuana operation. Ben the pacifist double-majored in business and botany at Berkeley and has the unkempt mane and wispy facial hair to prove it. Chon an Iraq veteran with scars both physical and emotional is rougher meaner. While Bens professionalism and easygoing nature prevent most of the violence typically associated with a drug business Chon handles whatever problems do arise. They are a complementary pair. Nobody knows this better than O (Blake Lively) their girlfriend. Yes their. In her function as narrator O -- her name is short for Ophelia -- informs us that Ben and Chon are both the love of her life and that their yin-and-yang personalities comprise for her one complete partner. The fellas are cool with this arrangement. The three of them share a beach house and a lot else. This idyllic three-sided relationship is disrupted as are so many things by a Mexican drug cartel. Headed by a vain treacherous she-devil named Elena (Salma Hayek) the organization seeks greater control of the California pot market and is particularly interested in the highly potent strain of weed that Ben and Chon (mostly Ben) have cultivated. Their business has benefited from the cooperation of a corrupt DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta) who runs interference with the feds but theres not much he can do to protect them from Tijuanas most notorious and decapitation-happy band of drug lords. Other key players include Elenas top henchman Lado (played by a leering sinister Benicio Del Toro) and Alex her well-dressed lieutenant (Demian Bichir). Alex is the one who meets directly with Ben and Chon to make an offer to absorb their business with Elena safely tucked away in her Mexico palace watching via webcam. But it is entirely Elenas decision to escalate matters when the bros decline her offer. Stone who co-wrote the screenplay with the novelist Winslow and Shane Salerno (""Aliens vs Predator Requiem"") lets it go mostly unspoken that all of this violence and death would be erased if the War on Drugs were ended but the point remains as subtext. Chon has been trained to kill by his government and uses tricks he learned from Iraqi insurgents to help fight Elenas cartel but Stone doesnt dwell on these facts either. In most instances where Stone has a choice between hammering a message home and telling an entertaining story he goes with the latter letting ""Savages"" function as nothing deeper than a gritty and glib damsel-in-distress action caper. In that respect its his most purely enjoyable no-ax-to-grind movie since ""Any Given Sunday."" (Of course ""enjoyable"" is a relative term. ""Savages"" has scenes of brutal violence that are difficult to watch. But you know what I mean.) Among the leads Johnson is more convincing as a hippie-dippy do-gooder than Kitsch is as a butch battle-scarred killer but the relationship between Ben and Chon feels authentic (or as authentic as a strictly heterosexual relationship between two men who have equal shares in the same girlfriend is liable to feel anyway). Lively despite her narrator duties has little to do story-wise. The real fun is in the less savory characters. Travolta is energetically nutty as the conniving DEA agent with Del Toro just as magnetic as the cruel assassin (who literally twirls his mustache on at least one occasion). But my favorite performance is Salma Hayek as the villainous yet surprisingly nuanced cartel chieftain a fiery Spanglish-spouting vixen who lands just this side of campiness. Its hard to tell how seriously were supposed to take any of this lurid guns-and-drugs ludicrousness; Johnson and Kitsch especially seem to be taking it more seriously than anyone else. To me Hayek strikes the right balance between thinking too hard about the storys inherent nonsense and sitting back and enjoying the ride.

I just dont believe the one thats at the center of Oliver Stones latest ""Savages."" Fans of Don Winslows acclaimed novel which I have not read have obviously embraced these characters in both the source material and his recently-published sequel but somewhere between the page and the screen (Winslow gets co-adapter credit with Stone and Shane Salerno) these central characters have been reduced from real-seeming people to glossy convenient archetypes. The key word being ""glossy"" as Stone and cinematographer Dan Mindel (""John Carter"" J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek"") introduce us to brainy and committed Ben (Aaron Johnson) tough guy Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and breezy O (Blake Lively) under a gleaming California sun that makes everything look like a Bain du Soleil commercial. Also read Oliver Stone at Savages Premiere What Audiences Will Take From My New Movie (Videos) Ben grows extraordinary marijuana with sky-high THC counts and devotes much of the proceeds to third-world schools and local medicinal co-ops with Chon providing the occasional muscle needed to keep the bad guys from harshing Bens mellow. O (short for ""Ophelia"") loves them both leading to sex scenes with each (and both) where her flesh is always more covered than the boys. Thats what happens when you date a girl with a no-nudity contract. Ruining their buzz is a Mexican drug cartel that wants in on their action. The guys are initially resistant to the idea and decide to pull up stakes and flee but the narcotraficantes kidnap O to force Ben and Chons hand. Once things get personal Ben and Chon go on the offensive attacking the cartel all the way up the food chain to godmother ""La Reina"" Irena (Salma Hayek) while scummy DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta sporting his natural hairline for once) plays both sides. Its almost a relief when O gets nabbed because thats the moment when ""Savages"" segues from being a ludicrous druggy SoCal fantasia to a pulpy trashy noir flick. The movie doesnt get any less ridiculous but at least it develops a pulse as both camps live up to the title and commit monstrous acts upon one another. Also read Oliver Stones Savages Trailer Comes Out With Guns Blazing (Video) Things fall apart at the end in a way that wont be revealed here but the climax smacks of either screenwriter desperation directorial indecision or ""this worked in the book"" -- in any event the last few minutes manage to fritter away a majority of whatever goodwill ""Savages"" has accrued. Speaking of screenwriter desperation the use of narration often feels like a tip-off that the filmmakers are taking the lazy way out of bringing us into a story; thats definitely the case here and having Blake Lively as the narrator certainly doesnt help matters. (Nor do lines like ""I have orgasms; Chon has war-gasms."") Johnson reveals a side of himself not shown in earlier films like ""Kick-Ass"" while Kitsch is perfectly serviceable as a character roiled with inner torment. If ""Savages"" happens to follow ""John Carter"" and ""Battleship"" into box-office oblivion Kitsch wont have to shoulder any of the blame for his participation. Also read Oliver Stone Interrogates Stars of Savages (Video) Its the old pros who walk away with the movie from Benicio Del Toro as a creepy cartel enforcer to Travoltas sleazy Teflon Fed. Hayek from her stentorious line readings to her Dragon Lady wig chews the scenery with picante relish; you almost wish she could have replaced Julia Roberts or Charlize Theron in their Snow White movies because this is one evil queen. Stone and his crew go out of their way to balance things out -- both the Mexicans and the gringos have a sensitive guy who pukes when someone dies -- but its hard to escape the notion that the heroes such as they are are the white folks while the villains are almost all brown. Thats the kind of argument to save for a more serious movie where all the characters arent cartoons. Ultimately the best thing about ""Savages"" is that its never dull. Just dont be fooled into taking it remotely seriously for even a second. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Area theaters. The living in Southern California is easy for Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Johnson) entrepreneurial marijuana growers in Oliver Stones fast furious ""Savages."" The two former high school buds the center of a hugely popular pot ""empire"" thats given them money and power in their 20s compliment each other Chon is a former Navy SEAL taut and serious while Ben is a laid-back Zenster his white-bread face crowned by Rasta dreads. As they get drawn further into a side of their business neither wanted to be part of director Oliver Stones aggressive crime thriller movie gets much darker. Almost everyone in this well-played film Stones most testosterone-filled since ""U-Turn"" (1997) pays for whatever mellowness they sought or sold. By the end the orangey colors that start the film end up looking like a Dreamsicle thats become a nightmare A big part of Chon and Bens early utopia is Ophelia (Blake Lively) the girlfriend they share who in a voiceover informs us she calls herself ""O"" and resents her given names Shakespearean connection. She lounges in their big house makes love to each guy (separately and together) and in general serves as Etta Place to their Butch and Sundance 2.0. Then the guys successful lab-tested cannabis attracts the attention of Elena (Salma Hayek) ruthless leader of a Mexican drug cartel. She sends her lackey Lado (scene-stealing Benicio Del Toro) to scare them. When they resist her offer to cut into the business it results in Os kidnapping. Chon and Bens DEA connection Dennis (John Travolta) who buys medical marijuana for his cancer-stricken wife suggests the dudes play ball. So they do their way They put one of Elenas political pals (Demian Bichir) in the DEAs spotlight then kidnap Elenas estranged daughter (Sandra Eccheveria) instigating a swap that has bad trip written all over it. Working from a novel by Don Winslow Stones landscape of corrupt innocents is beautifully nuanced allowing every character no matter how drug-war-weary a chance to be shell-shocked. Kitsch star of ""John Carter"" and ""Battleship"" finally reverses a bad year. he and Johnson hold their own against a towering Del Toro a sexy slithery Hayek and an enjoyably weaselly Travolta. Lively follows through on the promise she showed in 2010s ""The Town"" camouflaging steeliness in bleached-out blond beauty. Stone relies on his leads to guide us into this hyper-charged inferno and they fit his juiced-up approach like James Woods and Woody Harrelson did in Stones equally hopped-up ""Salvador"" and ""Natural Born Killers.""

How liberated from an agenda is this movie? Its about two marijuana dealers in Laguna Beach who run afoul of a Mexican drug cartel and the film has nothing at all to say about either undocumented immigrants or the war on drugs. Yet you can feel how alive Stone is to the material. He stamps every scene with his darkly combustible cinematic personality. Based on a novel by Don Winslow Savages is grandiose underworld pulp staged with screw-tightening skill and a taste for nasty kicks that spills over into sadism and dread. Its like a jacked-up Miami Vice told from the point of view of the criminals. The film is narrated in a Sunset Boulevard-meets-Kill Bill way by Ophelia (Blake Lively) known as O a free-spirited California blonde who lives with and loves two guys and is their anything-goes siren-goddess. Chon (Taylor Kitsch) a scarred sexy hunk of an Afghanistan war vet is the tougher and more volatile of the men. His friend and business partner the gentler Ben (Aaron Johnson) is a wispy-bearded nihilist hippie. The two went into the drug game together with a crop of ""primo"" marijuana seeds that Chon smuggled back from Afghanistan after enlisting in the military for that purpose. Theyve harvested those seeds into a greenhouse crop that yields weed with THC levels of 33 percent (the best high anyones ever had). But the popularity of their product threatens the cartels business which is why the gangsters come calling like a vicious corporation that talks ""partnership"" when it means ""hostile takeover."" Run by a ruthless matriarch (Salma Hayek) from her hacienda the cartel issues a warning in the form of a creepy Internet video of a dungeon full of freshly decapitated victims. But Chon and Ben are too arrogant to know what theyre dealing with. So the gangsters kidnap O and place her in the dungeon where they threaten to hack off her fingers. Savages is violent enough to risk turning off a portion of the audience. Yet even as the movie descends into blood-spattered exploitation its revving up the suspense. When characters are threatened with stuff this brutal youd better believe theres something at stake. To get O back Chon and Ben must become masterminds and warriors. They have to descend into savagery themselves. Stone presents some bravura set pieces from a pulse-quickening encounter with a highway cop to an incendiary multivehicle heist to every scene with Benicio Del Toro as a very scary sociopath. As for Taylor Kitsch he wipes away any lingering John Carter cobwebs with his explosive performance and John Travolta is funny and desperate as a DEA agent up to his ears in slime. Exciting as it is Savages does slide off the rails during the last half hour. The film goes from intense to indulgent plausible to preposterous. But its still a pleasure to see Stone settle into this dark groove. B+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

O (Blake Lively) the Blondifornia kidnap victim of a Mexican drug cartel spits in the face of her brutal jailer Lado (Benicio Del Toro) -- a big wet ball of phlegm as if shes been saving it throughout her incarceration for just this moment. Lado wipes the spittle off and licks his fingers then leans down and dries his face in her long hair. Its icky all right but the scene also turns the strange intimacy of captor and captive into a little epiphany of sensuous sado-tension. After a decade or so of suppressing his more lurid instincts Oliver Stone is back in the bat-crap-crazy mode that made his Oscar-winning rap-sheet rep. In turning Don Winslows 2010 novel Savages into a movie the writer-director returns him to his favorite early theme -- the wages of drugs in his screenplays for Midnight Express and Scarface -- and the Latin American locations and ambiance of Salvador and his documentaries on Fidel Castro (Commandante) and Hugo Chavez (South of the Border). At its wayward best Savages summons the craftily addled mania of prime Stone product like Platoon Natural Born Killers and U Turn movies about people driven to the edge of madness in film vehicles that go over the edge with them. (MORE Corliss on Natural Born Killers by subscribing to TIME) Early reviewers of Winslows book noted that it seemed ready-made for a Stone film. That may say more about the advanced age of the critics since the novel with its outsize bad guys and cross-border violence would also be suited to a younger generation of meta-action pictures Quentin Tarantino (who wrote the original script for Natural Born Killers) or Robert Rodriguez. But Stone got the gig allowing the 65-year-old enfant horrible to reclaim the bloody territory that he founded and they appropriated and repopulated. As timely as this weeks headlines -- the movie actually anticipated Sundays Mexican elections won by the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- Savages is also a bicultural fantasy of a heros blood lust and a drug bosss maternal devotion. Before her kidnapping O for Ophelia is the shared lover of soulful Ben (Aaron Johnson) and gritty Chon (Taylor Kitsch). When not enjoying groovy three-ways of bong-enhanced sex with O the lads run a nice little Laguna Beach marijuana business selling medicinal weed legally but making their real money shipping the stash out of state. Ben of the wispy beard and mild disposition is the genius chemist a Luther Burbank of pot. Chon a former Navy SEAL who acts as executive enforcer came back from Afghanistan with useful guerrilla skills and a strain of grass that Ben alchemized into a plant so potent that as the novel notes it ""could almost get up walk around find a lighter and fire itself up."" The two guys might be Esau and Jacob but without the messy birthright part or Jesus and Rambo; O calls them ""the Buddhist"" and ""the baddist."" (MORE Corlisss review of Oliver Stones South of the Border) Now Ben and Chon have the chance to become the Ben amp; Jerrys of dope. That Mexican cartel losing market share and foot soldiers to a rival operation has proposed to distribute the lads business for a modest 20% vig. No matter that altruistic Ben wants to chuck it all and save the Third World; the Mexicans led by La Reina Elena (Salma Hayek) with Lado as her steel muscle are loathe to take no for an answer. Besides as Dennis (John Travolta) a corrupt federal agent whose dying wife Ben and Chon have been supplying with pain-relieving cannabis tells them you dont say no to Walmart. ""This stuffll be legal in three years"" Dennis says so get rich now. ""Embrace the change."" Adapt or die. In the Darwinian negotiations with the cartel Ben and Chon are at a serious disadvantage. They lead with Orange Country bravado -- the sassy banter the subtle sneer -- while Elenas gang commandeers their computer to show them snuff videos of previous transgressors kills one of Chons men in his car and abducts O. They could be two surfers who stumbled into an ultimate-fighting cage with Godzilla. The boys are in the big leagues now and their adversaries treat them with contempt; ""Cheech and Chon"" Lado calls them. In retaliation they have only two possible ploys seizing a huge load of cartel weed with the help of Chons old SEALs brigade and kidnapping Magda (Sandra Echeverria) the daughter Elena loves. (MORE Corlisss cover story on Oliver Stones Platoon) Were supposed to root for Ben Chon and O because I guess theyre American. And unlike Lado they dont shoot sleazy lawyers in the legs before murdering them; nor do they end a brief job-evaluation interview with a young underling by saying ""It didnt work out youre too sensitive"" and blowing his head off. Too bad that the three heroes-by-default are pretty vapid compared with the villains. Kitsch rebounding from less compelling leads in John Carter and Battleship has the requisite grits for Chon; but Johnson the young English actor who seized the screen in Nowhere Boy and Kick-Ass cant save Ben from hippie dippiness. Lively who got the role after Jennifer Lawrence skipped out to do The Hunger Games shouldnt have. An insufficient siren for her lovers and a whiny captive to boot -- dissatisfied by her grub she virtually begs for arugula -- O has only one function in the plot as bait. And frankly her life isnt shown as being worth saving. The veterans though know how to have evil fun with their characters. Shea Whitman does fine by the corrupt lawyers role a California slime bag who goes from top dog to dead dog in about a minute flat. Emile Hirsch nails the breezy amorality of his small part as Ben and Chons money-launderer. Hayek in Elizabeth-Taylor-as-Cleopatra wig has maternal gravitas to match her business-titan cojones. Travolta 35 years into movie stardom and here brandishing an endangered-species hairline always perks up when playing baddies; his Dennis is a bad cop and master salesman who can make any commodity seem attractive including his own life to the murderous Lado. Del Toro whose performances are too often the sum of their mannerisms lives creepily inside Lado next to whom Al Pacinos Tony Montana in Scarface is a neutered puppy. Youll be pleased that in one of Savages shoot-out climaxes (yes there are two) this rancidly savory character takes longer to die than Mel Gibsons Jesus. (MORE Corliss on the Oliver Stone-scripted Scarface) And if you dont like the plot or the performances just watch the damn movie. Cinematographer Don Mindel obviously looked at the grand work of Robert Richardson on 11 early Stone pictures. Mindel will backlight a face framed in gaudy red flora and supersaturates the desert landscapes with a sickly glow that make them seem like nuclear testing grounds after the big boom. Stone and his three editors keep these hallucinogenic images churning at lunatic speed and add gimmicks of their own when Ben and Chon must transport a stash from Laguna to Mexico in five hours we see a countdown digital clock with a moon scampering across the screen to suggest fleeting time. The whole picture moves like that nearly overcoming the flaws of conflicted rooting interest and whatever qualms a Ben-like viewer might have about closeups of executions. Savages isnt great cinema but its a very alive movie about people who probably ought to be dead.

Savages Good Director Oliver Stone. Cast Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson Blake Lively. Rating R for strong brutal and grisly violence some graphic sexuality nudity drug use and language throughout. For instance when an Oliver Stone movie begins with a group of men being held hostage on their knees crying and you hear the sound of a chain saw start up well you know what to expect Over-the-top Stone the best kind the kind that stirs the pot. And thats just what you get in ""Savages."" About time. If ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" put you to sleep ""Savages"" should wake you up; it seems to have done the same for Stone. Its based on a novel by Don Winslow but in style and temperament its all Stone (who like Winslow contributed to the screenplay). While making such movies as ""JFK"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" Stone seemed fearless both in what he put on screen and how he put it there. A lot of that spirit returns here. Interview Taylor Kitsch Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Johnson) are best friends even though their perspectives on life differ. Chon is a former Navy SEAL a shoot-first kind of guy. Ben is a botanist who wants to change the world. As a colleague puts it he goes ""all Bono"" and makes trips to Africa to help the poor. But they have pooled their talent in an unusual enterprise They grow the best marijuana in the world. This has made them enormously wealthy as their fabulous Laguna Beach digs illustrate. And they share everything -- including O short for Ophelia (Blake Lively). She refers to both of them as the love of her life and some early scenes make a case for it. Its Os narration that opens the story (and lamentably continues throughout). The happy threesome is living the good life free of law-enforcement interference thanks to a bought-off DEA agent named Dennis (John Travolta). But then one day a Mexican drug cartel comes calling wanting in on their action. Its led by Elena (Salma Hayek) and she means business -- its her henchmen wielding the chain saws in the opening scene. Shes losing out on business to a rival cartel so she wants to expand into Chon and Bens turf. Despite a subtly threatening offer from Alex (Demian Bichir) one of Elenas lieutenants Chon and Ben pass Chon in insulting fashion. None of this sits well of course and soon with the help of the lethal Lado (Benicio Del Toro) O is kidnapped. Chon and Ben must figure out ways to come up with the money to free her which is when things get really gruesome. This is in fact one of the more violent movies in recent memory. But Stone doesnt let anyone off easy. Violence has an effect here has meaning has relevance to the story. And thats a good thing; otherwise it would be hard to stomach. Kitschs character is one-note -- hes the muscle the stone-cold killer. Livelys O is somewhat vapid by design. Johnson has the trickiest role of this bunch as Ben must go from pacifist to death-dealer in short order. Johnson so good as a young John Lennon in ""Nowhere Boy"" is up to the task. But the supporting cast is where the film really shines. Travolta doesnt have a lot of screen time but his weaselly agent is suitably amoral. Hayek is convincingly menacing as the ruthless Elena -- who like everyone else in the film has a weak spot. But Del Toro is tremendous having a blast as the slippery Lado. Just his look -- with his blown-back hair mustache and aviator sunglasses he looks like he stepped out of 1975 -- is hilarious. His methods are less funny however. Lado doesnt let distractions like morality get in the way of his work. As with the best Stone movies -- this isnt one of them but its plenty good -- there is a lot of humor most of it of the pitch-black variety. And hes back to mixing up the look of film sometimes from scene to scene or frame to frame giving it all a head-trip excitement including the ending. Hes not showing off with his message as much as with his technique perhaps but in ""Savages"" Stone still gets his point across in stylish provocative fashion.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Both Savages central pot-growing threesome and the Mexican drug cartel they tangle with get labeled with the titular insult of Oliver Stones new film and oh do they earn it. Kidnapping decapitations rape torture--marijuana may be on the verge of legality in California but as a business it justifies some nasty means to its ends. Savages is a bright messy smear of a movie adapted from Don Winslows novel of the same name one thats violent sultry and entertainingly sleazy while falling short of the satirical edge the material necessitates. Like Wall Street Money Never Sleeps and W. Savages feels like Stone softballing something he should be skewering--in this case SoCal entitlement and faux-progressive hypocrisy. Fortunately for Savages the aesthetic attributes of its cast along with some scene-stealing performances from the south-of-the-border side of its drug feud give the film enough appeal to carry it through a rambling runtime. Blake Lively plays O nee Ophelia a mall-loving Orange County beach bunny who narrates the film in a dazed voiceover. Shes in an unconventional but sincere relationship with both Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) best friends who run a high-end cannabis business. (The guys dont fool around though one observer suggests the only way this arrangement could work is if they loved each other more than their mutual girlfriend.) When they turn down a partnership proposal from a cartel run by Elena (Salma Hayek) she has Lively kidnapped to demonstrate it wasnt intended to be optional. Soon Kitschs dead-eyed former soldier has convinced Johnsons hippie Buddhist that theres a right time for force (and the occasional immolation). Johnson Kitsch and Lively compare themselves to Butch Sundance and Etta but theyre at most a diet version vacant but pretty. (Stone shoots Livelys windblown tresses like theyre a special effect.) Hayek though is ferocious as a ruthless crime lord turned metaphor for first-generation self-loathing and Benicio Del Toro as her henchman Lado is magnetic as he slides from amusing to frightening. He and a surprisingly solid John Travolta playing a corrupt D.E.A. agent are the only two figures with the luxury of approaching the escalating conflict with a sense of humor. Its something the film itself could use more of though there are flashes--like Lively demanding from her cartel captors a ""salad every once in a while""--that offer a promise of what could have been and indicate the double-take ending should have felt more stinging than cop-out.

"Review Savages - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Savages The good the bad the boring  Savages John Travolta and Taylor Kitsch in ""Savages."" John Travolta and Taylor Kitsch in ""Savages."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Taken from Don Winslows novel the Oliver Stone fulminator""Savages"" proves that marijuana cultivation sales and distribution are the right way to live large and menage a trois it through endless summer days and nights with your bromantic best pal and your special lady friend. Life is beautiful and Laguna Beach Calif. is full of beautiful people nearly as beautiful as you.Your marijuana business may receive unwanted interest from representatives of a Mexican drug cartel and there may be some torture and head-removal by chain saw related to your interactions with that cartel. But with luck those things will happen to lesser players in your story not you. Main players in a moment but first the supporting cast.Best of show here Benicio Del Toro. The Oscar winner stayed on the right side of the law in ""Traffic""; here in Stones film which Stone adapted along with Shane Salerno and Winslow Del Toro oozes ooze as the scuzziest Mexican drug lord in existence. His character Lado works for the head shoulders and cleavage of the Baja cartel La Reina portrayed by Salma Hayek in what appears to be a sampling of a million different telenovela villains. Each time Del Toro rolls into the frame in ""Savages"" about to put the hammer down on an unfortunate colleague or submit to a verbal pistol-whipping from Ms. Big he sends up the material ever so slyly.A generation ago (in the Bond film ""License to Kill"") Del Toro transcended the limited opportunities afforded by a garden-variety henchman. Hes still transcending those boundaries without trashing the material which comes more or less pre-trashed the actor affirms his character actor wiles with every sinister flourish. How can you hate a guy who loves his job so much?""Savages"" is a silly and self-serious movie but its juiciest turns (John Travolta activates his exposition-heavy dialogue nicely as a jumpy double-dealing Drug Enforcement Administration officer) offer some distraction from the torpor generated by the scripts central trio. There is Chon ex-Navy SEAL and recent Iraq War veteran played by Taylor Kitsch. Aaron Johnson is Chons friend and business partner the pacifist Ben who believes in peace love helping the worlds poor and turning some of his drug profits over to righteously noble causes. Narrating the film Blake Livelys O (for Ophelia) bounces between the two and in voice-over establishes the desired tone of blase fatalism. ""Just cause Im telling you this story doesnt mean Im alive at the end of it"" she says.When the Baja crew tries to muscle in on the white boys action ""Savages"" flirts with indictments of the war on drugs in between scenes of flamboyant brutality. In one such bit recent Oscar nominee Demian Bichir (as La Reinas legal adviser) is seen with his eye dangling out of its socket after a bullwhip interrogation. Its not as if Stone is above this sort of pulp. But as rejiggered for the movies ""Savages"" has trouble making us care what happens to the beautiful people -- the untouchables -- at the center of the sun-baked fairy tale.

"Savages | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; savages ) Savages (United States 2012) July 04 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Savages is a drug-fueled crime delirium that doesnt break much new ground in the genre but offers a volatile concoction of violence heroism and amorality that is compulsively watchable. The director is Oliver Stone a filmmaker often associated with controversial material but Savages represents a straightforward non-political film that feels closer to what we have come to expect from Michael Mann than Stone. Theres no ulterior motive here; the directors goal is to bring Don Winslows novel to life on the screen and he does so effectively. The screenplay has its share of twists and turns but none are of the sort that stretch credulity and there are individual scenes in which the degree of suspense and tension escalates to edge-of-seat levels. The biggest problems with Savages are several narrative dead spots and the introductory sequences (obviously modeled after those in Martin Scorseses Casino) which are needlessly convoluted. Lengthy expository scenes should do a better job of setting up the backstory than these do. Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Johnson) are mismatched drug dealers. Chon a veteran of several tours in Afghanistan is a cold killer who thinks nothing of putting a bullet into the head of someone who double-crosses him. Ben on the other hand is a pacifist who follows Buddhist teachings and uses his share of the profits to fund overseas philanthropic enterprises. Both men are in love with Ophelia (Blake Lively) and she is in love with them. The trio cohabits in a state of unconventional domestic bliss where threesomes are regular occurrences and everything occurs through a haze of marijuana smoke. (Remember though its Ben and Chon not Cheech and Chong.) Ben and Chons brand is in great demand due to its high percentage of THC. A Mexican cartel led by crime lord Elena (Salma Hayek) wants to ""partner"" with Ben and Chon. She sends her lawyer Alex (Demian Bichir) to secure the deal. Ben and Chon are split over whether the ""partnership"" is a good idea. After consulting with a corrupt DEA agent (John Travolta) they decide to spurn the offer. Unwilling to let go of the opportunity Elena unleashes the dogs. She sends in psychopath Lado (Benicio Del Toro) to kidnap Ophelia. Thematically Savages illustrates how even the most laid-back and cultured men can be ruled by their base primal instincts when circumstances warrant it. But this isnt intended to be a deeply philosophical motion picture. It appeals on a visceral level offering bad guys with black hearts gruesome violence and the thrill of being unsure how things are going to resolve. The ending may generate a degree of dissatisfaction with some viewers; it can be seen as either a brilliant case of misdirection or a cheat. I side more with those who interpret it as the former but I can understand the viewpoint of the latter. It is gratuitous but it adds flair to the resolution. I think I would have enjoyed the movie equally without it though. From an acting standpoint Blake Lively makes a compelling case that she doesnt have what it takes to play this sort of a role; she lacks the chops to carry the elements of the movie in which she is expected to dominate. Its hard to accept that her Ophelia is the kind of sex goddess muse who inspires men to kill or to die. We feel the connection between Taylor Kitschs Chon and Aaron Johnsons Ben. These two have a full-blown ""bromance"" but the same degree of chemistry is not evident between either of these men and Lively. Her most convincing scene is one in which she shares a meal with Salma Hayek. John Travolta is Savages highest profile actor but his role is secondary and his performance is unremarkable. The scene-stealer is Benicio Del Toro who is frighteningly good as the sociopath Lado; this guy who belongs in a James Bond movie. Stone avoids the stylistic excesses that have damaged some of his previous efforts. The film begins in black-and-white with shaky cam action but the director quickly reverts to a more traditional approach. He finds a tripod and the action switches to color. With the exception of some filters to add tint to certain scenes Stones approach is refreshingly unadorned. There are few instances in which filmmaking technique interferes with an appreciation of the story or the suspense it begets. Savages delivers a more satisfying motion picture experience than nearly all of the higher profile bigger budgeted summer blockbusters.

Savages is a movie of its moment though both its good guys and bad guys (if theres really even a difference) are unquestionably the 1 percent of their industry--that is the weed trade. The setting is the 100 miles surrounding the California-Mexico border circa right this minute (a subplot involves Mexican elections which took place in real life on July 1) with Stone focusing on the human and fiscal politics of Californias twin pot economies one quasi-legal and the other criminal--a split that the film suggests can only last for so long.California dudes Ben and Chon (Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch) are dragged into a turf war with the expansion-minded Mexican cartel run by Salma Hayeks drug-war widow Elena and her brutally amoral deputy Lado (Benicio del Toro). The Mexicans regularly show their power by creating and disseminating videos documenting torture and beheadings. Eighty miles over the border in Laguna Beach Ben and Chon supply their ultra-potent genetically engineered strains to legal medical dispensaries but make their real money illegally shipping out of state. The product and its profits fuel the boys lifestyle of neo-hippie decadence embodied by the business partners enthusiastic bedroom sharing of poor little rich girl turned earth-mother floozy Ophelia (Blake Lively). Both sides consider the other to be ""savages""--which we know because they say it aloud multiple times. (Maybe when doing press for his last film Stone had one too many journalists ask ""But wait--what does Money Never Sleeps actually like mean?"")More than two hours long--and building to two endings one romantic-tragic and one quasi-ironic and romantic-ludicrous--Savages is bloated with plot and exposition much of which is related via the incessant voiceover of Ophelia who goes by O. (as she tells us . . . via voiceover). ""Just cause Im telling you this story doesnt mean Im alive at the end of it"" she says at the beginning of the film introducing the possibility of narrative innovation that the movie to come doesnt fulfill. Other pearls of wisdom delivered through this device ""Hes always trying to fuck the war out of himself. I have orgasms; he has wargasms"" and ""Dopes supposed to be bad but in a bad bad world its good."" Sometimes paraphrasing Stone himself at his most stoner-utopian (see the recent Hollywood Reporter interview in which the filmmaker declared ""I believe the grass is Gods gift"") O. is made quite literally the voice of the movie a responsibility the character is too wispy to shoulder. Lively is both appropriately spacey and convincingly vulnerable but as a point of identification O. is too naive and self-absorbed to care about even at her most victimized.Film Details Savages RatingR GenreDrama Running Time130 More Info Trailer The films micro-time-capsule approach is interesting but Stone Winslow and co-screenwriter Shane Salernos indulgence in both above-the-law fantasy and the only-in-Hollywood notion that love trumps business are more potent than any point theyre trying to make about our real world. Of course the law itself--represented by Travoltas fed who works both sides to serve only himself and whose never-seen wife is said to be using reefer for the pain of her cancer--is both corrupt and hypocritical. Its more indicative of the films lack of interest in character that psychological exploration of Chon a veteran of our Middle Eastern wars who smuggled sweet pot seeds out of Afghanistan and employs his former fellow soldiers as sniper-enforcers back in the States is limited to O.s deduction that ""he came back with lots of cash but no soul.""Soul is something Savages has in short supply not least because Kitsch and Johnson register as blanks on-screen. In contrast Hayek and del Toro both sporting apparently intentionally terrible wigs give big scenery-chewing performances and earn our interest and empathy even while committing heinous acts. Their knowing camp particularly contrasted by the dishwater petulance of the trio of white people the movie seems to want us to root for at least gives us something to laugh with rather than at.

If you can persuade yourself of this bad idea then the scuzz-violent pop-opera-drenched Savages is for you. Narrated in Blake Livelys slurriest most wayward-babe growl the movie feels cool in a strained way one that would ignore 20-plus years of gun-toting hyperverbal Tarantino cinema. Three tanned Laguna Beach pot dealers are our heroes ex-military Chon (Taylor Kitsch) softhearted Ben (Aaron Johnson) and the woman they seem to share--unrealistically--as a bed partner ""O"" (Lively). Soon enough--and its amazing how predictable the faux-provocative script (based on Don Winslows novel) is--here come the scary Mexicans sending our trio spooky e-mails snatching up their beloved blond and generally calling for tough tactics. Stone and his actors make this pulp watchable enough but hes a director whos a lot more fun when grafting his histrionic nerve onto weightier subjects presidents wars James Woodss ego. This time Stone is just sloshing around in the shallow end. When John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro show up for extended cartoonish dialogues youll wonder what year it is and let out a sigh of relief that the moment is long gone.

Yes the in-your-face filmmaker is back and in a big way. He returns to bloody fine form with ""Savages"" a sexy vicious and altogether riveting thriller thats the ""Born on the Fourth of July"" directors best movie in years.Based on the acclaimed best-selling novel by Don Winslow -- who co-wrote the crackling good script with Shane Salerno and Stone -- this lurid excursion into film noir territory insightfully exposes the California-Mexico marijuana business spices it up with heady references from Shakespeare then pushes the boundaries of an R rating with hot sex and cover-your-eyes brutal violence.Stone has never lacked ambition; when hes on fire his risk-taking pays off. Sometimes though he overshoots and misses. Unlike in the all-too-tame ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" he maintains a mostly tight grip on ""Savages."" If you enjoyed Stones ""U Turn"" but only wish there were more muscle in its narrative structure you will dig this. But if you hated that movie with Sean Penn Jennifer Lopez and Nick Nolte I have three words for you Flee flee fleeEither way theres no denying that ""Savages"" tells one hell of a confident story is stylishly directed and bursts with terrific performances.Advertisement ""Gossip Girls"" Blake Lively -- who stunned everyone in Ben Afflecks ""The Town"" -- stakes a bold claim as one of our most impressive young actresses striking the perfect tone as the voice-over narrator and acing a challenging part as O short for Ophelia. The rich Laguna Beach free spirit she plays shares love and body with two extremely successful pot dealers the tightly wound war vet Chon (Taylor Kitsch of ""Battleship"") and the do-gooder UC Berkeley botanist grad Ben (Aaron Johnson of ""Kick-Ass"").Their sun-kissed bacchanalian surfer days -- theres even a brief menage a trois -- come to a crashing halt when the Mexican Baja Cartel led by the ruthless Elena (Salma Hayek) all but demands a merger to jack up profits.Ben hopes to retire from the drug operation and just as the trio tries to leave the country Elenas vile henchman Lado (Benicio Del Toro) kidnaps O. From there the plot twists and turns dragging in a fascinating cast of characters -- including Elenas slick attorney (""A Better Lifes"" Demian Bichir) a cyclist (Emile Hirsch) whos a whiz with numbers and shuffling accounts and a shifty DEA agent (John Travolta).Thats a huge cast to keep in check but Stone draws out astonishing performances from each. Hayek tears into her villainess role while a volatile Kitsch bounces back from a string of duds. Johnson makes us feel the interior conflict roiling inside complicated Ben. My favorite scene though comes when Del Toro -- who creates one of the most odious villains of late -- and Travolta verbally joust in a kitchen. Its Travoltas best performance in some time and together they create acting magic.Theres quite a bit of directing magic from Stone as well who gives the film grit and style to spare aided by a nifty soundtrack that includes a great cover of David Byrnes ""Psycho Killer.""Stone occasionally falls back on some irksome directing tricks that call way too much attention to themselves like shifting to black-and-white every so often and hitting us over the head with an ending that overstates the symbolism of the plot. But thats kind of why we like the guy. With ""Savages"" Stone gets his mojo back -- and pulp-fiction fans are all the better for it.Savages    1/2Rating R (for strong brutal and grisly violence some graphic sexuality nudity drug use and language throughout)Cast Blake Lively Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson Salma Hayek Benicio Del Toro John Travolta Demian BichirDirector Oliver StoneRunning time 2 hours10 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Savages (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Savages (R) Oliver Stones ferocious tale of a drug war gone wrong is a repellent ridiculous mess. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/3/2012 Editor rating 1 With Savages director Oliver Stone sets aside the highfalutin airs of his last few pictures (Wall Street Money Never Sleeps W World Trade Center) and cuts loose with his idea of a fun summer movie -- a lurid fast-paced thriller about two California pot farmers whose mutual girlfriend is kidnapped by a rival Mexican cartel. This is the Stone of Natural Born Killers and U Turn and Any Given Sunday a director whose flair for absurdist excess and merciless satire can turn off viewers of milder sensibilities. But Savages is something those other movies were not Aggressively defiantly stupid. Based on Don Winslows well-regarded page-turner (he also co-wrote the script) the movie has a propulsive energy that suits Stone well as he recounts exactly how Chon (Taylor Kitsch) an ex-Navy SEAL and veteran of two tours in Afghanistan and Ben (Aaron Johnson) a college grad who majored in business and botany built a marijuana empire that turned them into millionaires. Using surreal visuals and montage Stone lays in the details needed to make you buy the movies central premise -- that these two ordinary guys with no connection to organized crime and no experience in the drug trade became happy-go-lucky beachfront kingpins. Those early scenes also introduce one of Savages more preposterous conceits The lovely bird-brained Ophelia (Blake Lively) who prefers to go by ""O"" and lives in carnal communion with the two guys letting them take turns with her in the sack and sometimes just sharing her bed with both of them at the same time. Even for an Oliver Stone movie the scenario is an awful lot to swallow. What kind of woman would ever agree to this? What two heterosexual men no matter how close would be comfortable with this arrangement? But you go with it at least initially because the entire plot hinges on their harmonious three-way union a bromance with a woman thrown in for sexual release. So when Ophelia is kidnapped by Elena (Salma Hayek) a Mexican drug lord who wants to force the gringos to share their profits the guys resort to desperate measures to get her back. How else will they have sex? The title of Savages is meant as a bitter joke Everyone in the movie from Elenas murderous goons (led by Benicio Del Toro) to a crooked DEA agent (John Travolta) to the likable heroes will commit extreme acts in order to get what they want. The war on drugs turns everyone into animals. Thats the only political statement Stone is out to make here other than smoking pot is not necessarily a bad thing. The rest of Savages is supposed to be pure if brutal entertainment pulp fiction with an unusually graphic punch. Stones reliance on practical effects (real blood squibs actual fireballs instead of CGI) is refreshing in an increasingly sterile action-film landscape and there are a couple of expertly executed set pieces such as an armored raid by Chon and Ben on a rivals camp or Ophelias suspenseful shopping spree at a mall that prove the director remains in full control of his prodigious technical gifts. This is a grand-looking movie (the cinematographer is Daniel Mindel who also shot Star Trek and John Carter) and the editing is precise. Stone takes moments many other directors might ignore -- such as a potential speeding ticket that threatens to erupt into violence -- and expands them into big memorable beats. But to what end? The superb craftsmanship and care behind Savages only helps to underscore what an asinine unconvincing picture this is. Kitsch Johnson and Lively are all young beautiful actors but they have the combined screen presence of a cactus During a dinner scene when Ophelia name-checks Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid your mind drifts for a moment wondering what Savages might have been like if Paul Newman Robert Redford and Katharine Ross in these roles. Then you realize they would have never starred in such a crummy half-baked movie. Stone hasnt been controversial for a while now -- even his much-hyped biopic of President George W. Bush was greeted by yawns -- and you can feel him pushing Savages to extremes eager to regain his edge. Instead though he comes off as desperate. Theres an inexcusably prolonged torture scene in the movie that is obviously meant to outdo the ear-slicing bit in Reservoir Dogs. But where Tarantino used suggestion and restraint and bleak ironic humor Stone just gives us repeated close ups of grotesque gore and the sight of a talented actor humiliating himself for the sake of shock value. The scene goes on for so long it becomes offensive because you get the feeling Stone regards the audience as idiots. Savages is filled with similarly insulting elements Del Toros pathetic Mexican accent which is as convincing as that of the Taco Bell chihuahua; the incessant voice-over narration by Lively which makes you wish her captors would tape her mouth shut; the ridiculous premise that a woman such as Elena who spends her days sitting on pillowed couches getting foot massages could really maintain control of such a dangerous volatile crew of killers. Worst of all what pushes Savages from merely mediocre into outright awful is the ending a bait-and-switch cop-out of such enormous proportions it becomes the biggest shock in the movie. After rubbing your face in garish excess for more than two hours the film punks out and turns into a Lifetime movie. Savages talks the talk but doesnt walk the walk For the first time in his hallowed career Stone comes off as a poseur.

A Pulpy Movie About the Drug War With Savages Oliver Stone Turns a Pulpy Novel About the Drug War Into... A Pulpy Movie About the Drug War Eric Kohn Jul 3 2012 1108 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Don Winslows 2010 novel ""Savages"" was a kaleidoscopic encapsulation of the war on drugs that read like a movie pitch an unabashedly pulpy blood-soaked smoke-filled gonzo-inflected and extremely sultry look at every facet of the drug trade from the perspective of its participants. Unsurprisingly erstwhile chronicler of countercultural excess Oliver Stone chose to adapt Winslows novel and the result is a fabulously adrenaline-charged work thats too messy to represent a comeback for Stone but certainly marks a return to form. Taking a screenwriting credit alongside Winslow and Shane Salerno Stone tackles this sun-soaked California tale of young marijuana growers tussling with the territorial Mexican cartel by borrowing the books breathless forward motion and wily tone. Winslows free-associative writing style assumed the voice of its uniformly criminal protagonists and at times even devolved into a screenplay itself. Too ambitious for its own good Winslows eager style allows it to swing from page to page for the same reason. Stone boils down the essence of this approach by laying out its various power players through the voiceover narration of Ophelia (Blake Lively) nee O a freewheeling stoner who spends her days cavorting around with entrepreneurial weed peddlers Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch). The two men share a posh life with O that extends to the bedroom but otherwise have little in common. Ben the brains of the operation is a hippie buddhist who applies his dough to charitable causes abroad while menacing ex-Navy SEAL Chon uses his overseas training to provide the muscle for their operation. In the novel Winslow had the gall to blatantly compare their seemingly ill-fated threesome to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (as did Stephen King in a generous pull quote) and the movie makes the same brash connection. Needless to say ""Savages"" trades the emotional depth of that earlier achievement for trashy fun. Stones uneven direction veers from near-amateurish genre antics to an enjoyable awareness of those same standards. Even when it doesnt hold together the plot barrels forward in fits of violence and increasingly high stakes. The trios lifestyle hits a wall when the Baja Cartel a powerful operation led by the feminine powerhouse dubbed ""Elena the Queen"" (Salma Hayek) demands a cut of Ben and Chons profits. When the boys turn up their noses Elena sics her ferocious henchman Lobo (Benicio Del Toro) on their new enemy and orders him to kidnap O. With Ben and Chons shared girlfriend in captivity they scramble to gather the dough necessary to spring her free. The ensuing barrage of hold-ups shootouts and further kidnappings unfold in underwhelming doses. ""Savages"" clicks better when it relegates the conflict down to a series of terse exchanges that illustrate the drug trades mutually assured destruction. Challenging the cartel Ben and Chon face down a stalwart operation characterized by John Travoltas corrupt DEA agent Dennis as the ""Walgreens"" to their grassroots effort. ""Dont fuck with Walgreens"" Dennis warns. Chon doesnt take orders from anyone ""You want us to eat your shit and call it caviar"" he tells the Cartel a line that comes back to haunt him. After its first hour ""Savages"" sags from its reliance on this grimy sensationalism. However its shortcomings are largely rectified by an enthusiastic ensemble. Kitsch and Johnson handle their thin roles well enough and Lively rises to the challenge of sending up Os carefree materialism but the movie predominantly belongs to its older supporting characters. Hayeks scowling boss is balanced by Travoltas whiny cop and Del Toros cartoon thug. Unfortunately they arent the stars of the show as much as the spectacle. Stone adopts a restless visual scheme for each scene that gives the impression of ""Natural Born Killers The Next Generation"" even using the occasional black-and-white footage in true ""NBK"" tradition. However the eager stylistic flourishes cant distract from the overall derivative nature of the material. Winslows storytelling relies on personality types already done to death on the likeminded satiric exposes of American drug trade seen on the television series ""Weeds"" and ""Breaking Bad."" The existence of both shows several years into their lifespans indicate that this aggressively dark tale lacks a fresh edge. Nevertheless Stone manages to deliver the guilty pleasure shoot-em-up that the material begs for and while he cant make the wild ride last he does find a way to editorialize with it. The single greatest deviation from the source material is the movies ending which turns away from the ""Butch Cassidy"" reference point in favor of something closer to ""The Sting."" Stone eventually arrives at a crowdpleasing finale thats at once troublesome and provocative. No matter how unsettling ""Savages"" gets it retains the DNA of a fairy tale. That takeaway creates the perception of the war on drugs as a fantasy played out in the minds of its participants and in that regard it represents Stones most radical political statement in years. Criticwire grade B- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Universal releases ""Savages"" nationwide this Friday in the wake of an aggressive marketing campaign that should help it land a respectable performance on opening weekend although it faces steady competition from ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" for now followed by ""The Dark Knight Rises"" later this month.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Francois Duhamel) Francois Duhamel This film image released by Universal Pictures shows John Travolta  left and Taylor Kitsch in a scene from ""Savages."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Francois Duhamel) As much as any director alive Oliver Stone understands the role of violence in world affairs. And unlike fellow action auteurs Martin Scorsese Quentin Tarantino and Francis Ford Coppola combat-veteran Stone has walked the walk so the horror is never just an apocalyptic pose.The director of ""Platoon"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" has been relatively low-key in the past decade as if current events had outraced his imagination or his ability to critique them. But after treading water with ""World Trade Center"" ""W."" and ""Wall Street 2"" Stone has caught a mighty wave with ""Savages."" At the confluence of altered states and state-sanctioned violence this drug-fueled thriller is Stones most successfully provocative picture since ""JFK.""Based on the timely novel by Don Winslow its the story of two complementary California pot dealers. Ben (Aaron Johnson) is a brilliant botanist who spreads his seed to needy chemo patients. Chon (Taylor Kitsch redeeming a young career that was almost sunk by ""Battleship"" and ""John Carter"") is a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who has monetized the marijuana and ensured prompt payments from legitimate dispensaries and disreputable characters alike. In laid-back Laguna Beach the longtime friends share a sea-view mansion and sleep with sweetly hippie-ish Ophelia (Blake Lively). When their idyll is invaded by a Mexican cartel that sends them a torture video as an invitation to collaborate Buddhist Ben is ready to sell his stake. But Chon is confident they can battle the banditos with the help of Dennis (John Travolta) a DEA agent who is on their payroll because his wife has cancer and needs their cannabis.Before the two dudes can respond to queen-bee Elena (Salma Hayek) her bad lieutenant Lado (Benicio Del Toro) kidnaps Ophelia and issues a deadline. Ben is left with little choice but to go on the offensive and his initiation into Chons worldview of violence is powerfully dramatized.The movie wouldnt work without a first-class cast. Travolta makes a wonderfully selfish schlub and Del Toro is as memorably malevolent as Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"" without a gimmicky wig. ""Savages"" is so rooted in the real world of the 21st century that even the computer-delivered death threats get under our skin. Be forewarned -- this narco nightmare is tougher than ""Traffic."" Its also smarter than ""Scarface"" which Stone wrote during his manic phase in the 80s.Notwithstanding a divisive do-over ending ""Savages"" is the work of a sophisticated craftsman. After decades of digging beneath the surface Stone understands the synthesis of good and evil in a way that weekend savages cannot.

The disreputable Oliver Stone of old makes a largely welcome reappearance with ""Savages."" Pungent nasty and teeming with colorful crooked types the writer-directors most vibrant (and violent) work in some time is a bracingly sordid saga of two young pot growers the Orange County princess they love and the vicious Mexican cartel they get entangled with; imagine ""Jules and Jim"" with bombs and beheadings and youre halfway there. Even when it softens the impact of Don Winslows scorching novel this R-rated Universal release bristles with tension and will likely enjoy a brief B.O. high that should last longer in ancillary. An acidly funny chronicle of sex drugs murder and corruption of every stripe Winslows attention-grabbing 2010 novel seemed so tailor-made for Stone that it was fast-tracked into his hands shortly after publication. Following a string of films that found the director playing uncharacteristically nice with sometimes politically loaded material (""World Trade Center"" ""W."" and ""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"") ""Savages"" offers nothing more nor less than a rude blast of cinematic energy invigorating in its foulness and refreshing in its lack of self-importance. Populated by wasted beauties and ruthless thugs and shot through with moments of black humor and hair-trigger intensity this bloody scuzzy cocktail of a movie assuredly wont be to every taste. Something similar could be said of the Afghanistan-derived super-cannabis harvested and distributed by peace-loving environment-friendly Ben (Aaron Johnson) and his more volatile partner Chon (Taylor Kitsch) an ex-Navy SEAL whos not afraid to get nasty when their clients do the same. These Laguna Beach layabouts share not only a successful business but also a lover Ophelia aka O (Blake Lively) a blonde babe whose interests include shopping smoking pot and keeping her boys happy. ""For me they are one big man"" O murmurs in hazy voiceover one of several lines that may leave the viewer unsure whether to laugh or toke up. Even still the tonally tricky script (by Shane Salerno Stone and Winslow) seems inclined to take these characters at least somewhat seriously jettisoning much of the satirical distance and scalding humor that made the novel a merciless evisceration of affluent O.C. culture. Dan Mindels gorgeous beachfront cinematography lends the early scenes an idyllic dreamlike beauty that quickly fades when Ben and Chon turn down representatives of the Baja California cartel who want to mass-market the duos extremely potent product. Soon O is kidnapped (from the mall natch) taken to Mexico and locked up in a grungy Mexican compound run by ball-breaking cartel queen Elena (Salma Hayek) and her vile deputy Lado (Benicio Del Toro). Rounding out this human circus are Lados dapper colleague (Demian Bichir) and a dirty-dealing DEA agent (John Travolta proudly displaying a receding hairline) both of whom in keeping with the storys topsy-turvy moral logic turn out to be more sympathetic than expected. Preposterous as much of it is the tale nonetheless generates a certain cross-cultural fascination as these narcissistic nihilistic but highly resourceful kids find themselves down Mexico way. Indeed the rest of the plot propelled by shootings stabbings and a few well-placed explosives plays out like a contest to see which of these two warring factions can best live up to the description of the title. For all its moment-to-moment ferocity the film becomes a kinder gentler thing than its source material defanged by Os wispy philosophizing narration and a twisty cop-out of an ending. Yet if ""Savages"" never quite captures the novels diamond-hard sarcasm it offers other satisfactions in its visceral immediacy its overriding sense of danger and a clutch of performances that whatever ones reservations about the characters cant help but court the viewers emotional investment. Because Ben Chon and O are written to seem so vacuous from the outset their occasional flashes of pluck and intelligence register as virtual epiphanies. Admittedly Kitsch doesnt have much more to do than play a slightly screw-loose killing machine while Lively tends to stay in damsel-in-distress mode before gradually asserting herself in the final stretch. That leaves Johnson (""Kick-Ass"") to do most of the dramatic heavy lifting as desperate circumstances push Ben from gormless pacifist to fierce man of action. Holding the screen to far more galvanizing effect is Del Toros loathsome Lado looking murderously unstable even when hes not shooting guys in the kneecaps. And Hayek wearing a long Cleopatra wig sinks her teeth into her meatiest role in some time as a formidable yet not invulnerable crime boss who has made enormous sacrifices to build authority in her domain. Up-to-the-minute technology provides a key storytelling assist as both sides use TV and computer screens to negotiate with threaten and spy on each other. Video footage including some grisly evidence of the cartels more unspeakable crimes is deftly interwoven by a trio of editors who maintain an electric pace throughout. Stylistically the picture isnt quite as unhinged as one might expect or want though the intense color palette sometimes fades to monochrome in an attempt to convey a sort of druggy poetry. Shooting widescreen on 35mm with anamorphic lenses Mindel achieves a hot sizzling look that suits the locations (Malibu Los Angeles and Orange County) as well as Tomas Voths production design capturing lives of upper-class privilege and south-of-the-border squalor.

TWITTER Stoneas rendition of Don Winslowas drug-cartel drama is created with a jagged darkly trippy style that expresses the storyas tense uncertainties. To anyone who has missed the Oliver Stone of Natural Born Killers and U Turn while wading through the more recent and conventional likes of World Trade Center and Wall Street Money Never Sleeps Savages represents at least a partial resurrection of the directors more hallucinatory violent sexual and in a word savage side. This intense and unavoidably gory adaptation of Don Winslows wild best-seller about the incursion of Mexican drug cartel mayhem into the United States has been made in a jagged darkly trippy style that well expresses the storys tense uncertainties. But the pronounced superiority of the veteran supporting players to the young actors playing the central romantic threesome throws the balance off and leaves a high-caliber-sized hole in the middle of a film that should nonetheless play well to blood-and-guts-inclined men internationally. Winslows 2010 novel -- the prequel to which The Kings of Cool has just been published -- is so vivid and propulsive that you can practically see a movie in your head while reading it. For all its insane violence and dizzying plot turns the story spins on a fanciful but believable love triangle among Laguna Beachs two most successful independent pot growers/dealers and their hedonistic free spirit of a girlfriend. PHOTOS Blake Lively Taylor Kitsch Walk the Red Carpet at Savages L.A. Premiere With all the pressure the guys endure when a Mexican crime family puts the squeeze on them the center represented by the love story has got to hold; it should beguile entice turn you on and feel special as in Design for Living or Jules and Jim. Unfortunately the trio impersonated by Taylor Kitsch Aaron Johnson and Blake Lively seem rather junior league the Triple-A team where All-Stars are required. Theyre not bad just not good enough when they have to tangle with the unbridled likes of John Travolta Benicio Del Toro and Salma Hayek as assorted cohorts and adversaries. Livelys easygoing SoCal beach girl commonly known as O (as in Ophelia her birth name and orgasm a propensity for which she is well known) narrates the tale with noticeably less energy than the film itself possesses and an omniscience that makes no sense if you think about it. Within the first 15 minutes she gets it on with both Chon (Kitsch) a hotheaded and hard-bodied former Navy SEAL and sensitive save-the-world do-gooder Ben (Johnson) whos the best botanist ever to turn his talents to designer weed. Living in an enviable oceanside crib they make and distribute superdope for discerning patrons able to pay for it and live the great life as a result. PHOTOS Oliver Stone Happy Sane and at the Top of His Game But while U.S. law enforcement has been persuaded to look the other way such success attracts the notice of Elena (Hayek) a cartel queen whose losing battle with rival El Azul in Mexico has her looking for opportunities north of the border. Out of the blue Chon and Ben receive an offer theyre not at liberty to refuse -- to put their operation under Elenas blood-soaked umbrella. And just in case theyre thinking of cashing in and checking out which they are Elenas American-based goon Lado (Del Toro) kidnaps O and assures them the worst will happen to her if they make one false move. The script by Shane Salerno novelist Winslow and Stone illustrates how once infected with the cutthroat when-in-doubt-kill-em plague embodied in the drug lords m.o. its impossible to shake it; once youve crossed to the dark side you cant go back. The gangsters impose the rules of the game and its instant Lord of the Flies Everyone descends to the most brutal elemental survival of the fittest level of human behavior with no quarter given. STORY Blake Lively Smolders in a Zuhair Murad Strapless Gown at Savages L.A. Premiere (Video) To save O from execution -- held in a cage shes viewable from time to time on a computer feed -- Chon and Ben are forced into a covert game of one-upmanship with their criminal bosses while still appearing to play by their rules. Through the auspices of their surfer/stoner financial whiz Spin (Emile Hirsch in a brief amusing turn) they move their money around and to raise the rest of the cash they need to bail out O come up with an ingenious scheme they cant get away with for long robbing their bosses bagmen. This ploy stirs intense internal suspicion within Elenas organization which is further disrupted by documents the boys procure from frantic DEA official Denis (Travolta) whos compromised up to his disappearing hairline and often is forced to improvise to save his skin. Stone and his collaborators depart from the novel significantly in the films third act and smartly so partly by expanding the Dennis role and especially by developing a propriety interest in the imperious Elena on behalf of the powerless O creating some charged scenes and added emotional overlay (Os flighty mother a character in the book was played by Uma Thurman but the entire role was cut). The action-packed Middle East war-style climax also has been gleefully toyed with to provocative effect. THR COVER STORY Oliver Stone Uncensored I Was Crazy for Many Years But the storys progression moves ones interest and sympathies away from Chon and Ben whose personalities are defined at the outset and never acquire further weight or psychological dimension. Although as big-time drug dealers they are technically criminals from the beginning they certainly arent meant to be perceived that way by Winslow or Stone; Chons anti-social shoot-first/ask-questions-later impulses are seen to stem entirely from his combat experiences in Afghanistan while Ben is a latter-day hippie whose well-meaning urge to save the world marks him as ""the soft one"" in the eyes of Lado always on the lookout for an opponents weak spot. As Chons all-action personality is readily apparent on the surface Kitsch comes off reasonably well in his characterization of a battle-hardened vet who would seem to harbor a death wish. Forced to make a drastic transition from idealistic greenhouse genius to brutal if unwilling killer Ben is by far the more conflicted and complex role but his inner torment takes a back seat to the sweep of plot and action; he ends up being not very interesting something for which Johnson is unable to compensate. In a role that if one could pick any actress from the history of cinema would have been played most ideally by Tuesday Weld Lively doesnt really live up to her name coming off more slack than slacker. Crucially a chemistry among the three leads never takes hold to seduce the audience into investing deeply in the privileged moments of the trios inevitably short-lived romantic high. STORY Savages Star Blake Lively Describes Awkward Sex Scene With Taylor Kitsch (Video) As if receiving charges of electric current at regular intervals Travolta is manic and most amusing as the government agent forced into ethical and practical contortions to stay afloat; Del Toro entertainingly showboats while demonstrating dozens of ways to convey diabolical menace; and Hayek synthesizes ultimate elegance motherly concern and complete ruthlessness as the Lady Macbeth of the Mexican drug world. Stylistically Stone summons up many of the visual and aural tropes of his creatively assaultive works of 15 or so years ago to mostly strong effect; theres solarization and blood-soaked saturation alternation from color to black-and-white and film to computer/video images altered state-suggestive editing warping of time and anything else he can think of -- all appropriate to the occasion. The re-creations of cartel charnel house torture are gruesome and pushed to the limit of mainstream acceptability. The film is technically sharp and the highly varied score -- a mix of original and source music -- is marked by the exceptionally dramatic use of the opening of Brahms Symphony No. 1 in two key scenes.
