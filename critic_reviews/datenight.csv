By Peter Rainer Film critic April 9 2010 Save for later Saved In this photo Tina Fey left and Steve Carell are shown in a scene from Date Night. Myles Aronowitz/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Why are Steve Carell and Tina Fey wasting their time and ours by appearing in the miserable comedy ""Date Night""? Replenishing their bank accounts I suppose but still - there must be better movie material out there for such sharp performers. It used to be that television was the fallback position for movie actors most of whom only deigned to appear on the tube when they were over the hill. Nowadays TV fare especially dramas and (some) comedies - like Carells ""The Office"" or Feys ""30 Rock"" not to mention ""Saturday Night Live"" - are usually smarter and edgier than their movie counterparts. In ""Date Night"" Fey and Carell play a bored suburban married couple who decide to spice things up by going out for a fancy New York dinner. They end up enmeshed in a shootem-up scenario that is dumb even by the usual dumb Hollywood standards. Actors like James Franco Mark Ruffalo Taraji P. Henson and Mark Wahlberg whose role requires him to go shirtless throughout show up to no avail. Fey and Carell spend a lot of screen time flustered especially during the films climactic car chase in downtown Manhattan which also features an African-American cabby who is required to act like a popeyed racial caricature.Fey in particular seems uncomfortable with the shenanigans. If this film and ""Baby Mama"" and ""The Invention of Lying"" are any indication maybe she isnt cut out for the movies after all. Or more likely she just doesnt care enough about giving her best to movies. But Hollywood comedies desperately need her wicked asperity. Is she maybe holding out until Sarah Palin makes a run for president? Grade D (Rated PG-13 for sexual and crude content throughout language some violence and a drug reference.)

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Banksy Tags Himself Exit Through the Gift Shop was going to be a documentary about a graffiti artist. Then he and the director swapped jobs. By David Edelstein Published Apr 11 2010 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Paranoid Pictures) The acidly funny documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop the directorial debut of the British graffiti artist Banksy (real name unknown) is the happy upshot of an unhappy accident. As he explains on-camera (in silhouette under a hood his voice distorted) Banksy decided to have a go at more than a thousand hours of video shot by an obsessive Frenchman named Thierry Guettaunprecedented footage of guerrilla street artists at their clandestine labors among them Shepard Fairey Invader and Banksy himselfafter Guettas own assemblage turned out like the work of someone with mental problems an unimaginable nightmare. To get the unemployed sad-sack Guetta out of his hair Banksy gave him a metaphorical pat on the head and told him to go back home to Los Angeles and try making his own art. This leads to the documentarys final section in which Guetta having adopted the ridiculous nom de plume Mr. Brainwash attempts to conquer L.A. with an immense exhibition. So the films original director has become its subject and its prize subject its director. Narrated by Rhys Ifans with the dryness of a dessicated toad Exit Through the Gift Shop is both an exhilarating testament to serendipity and an appalling testament to art-world inanity. See AlsoRead a response to questions concerning Guettas identity on David Edelsteins blog the Projectionist. Banksy resists making Guetta an altogether loathsome character. The Frenchmans childhood was shattered by the sudden loss of his motherwhich led to his resolve to document everything which perhaps informed his zest for capturing on video the most impermanent of art forms. He is more a classic fool somewhere between Peter Sellerss Inspector Clouseau and Chance the Gardener. Where Warhol gave us a Campbells Soup can Mr. Brainwash gives us a Campbells Soup spray-can. Elvis Presley holds a Fisher-Price toy gun. The oeuvre is derivative of the derivative. Having endured the subway eyesores of the early eighties I hold a relativist view of street art If its good it justifies the vandalism; if it isnt it warrants imprisonment and/or the forfeiture of a hand. But there is no questioning Banksys art. As shown in Guettas footage his satirical assaults on politics and culture in settings as various as the alleyways of London the barrier wall of the West Bank and a ride at Disneyland are affronts of geniusstinging with a lingering afterburn. As a director hes just as explosively succinct. May he vandalize our screens for decades to come. From the sixties to the eighties mainstream moviegoers were righteously appalled by grindhouse revenge flicks and their attendant splatter leaving us young punks to whoop it up at such haute gutbucket fare as Stuart Gordons Re-Animator and the Japanese Lone Wolf and Cub series (with its samurai hero lopping off limbs while pushing a baby in a cart). Such heady times Now a generation weaned on Quentin Tarantino has made geyserific gore both hip and common (in both senses). And here comes Kick-Ass to clean up at your neighborhood multiplex and lower the killing age. Based on a comic by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. the movie opens a bit like the 1999 comedy Mystery Men with its nerdy protagonist (Aaron Johnson) who dreams of becoming a superhero and celebrity. But when the touchingly inept teen in his green-and-yellow wetsuit gets a knife plunged into his gut (in close-up) reality kicks in with a vengeance. Vengeance kicks in with a vengeance. Beyond its high-hemorrhage quotient and recurrent F- and C-words Kick-Ass brings something more transgressive to the party. The most gleeful (and dexterous) executioner is a pixieish blonde 11-year-old (Chloe Grace Moretz) who calls herself Hit-Girl. Her ex-cop dad (Nicolas Cage) once framed by a mobster has schooled her in the art of lowlife-cleansing. Theres a disconnect when you watch Should a girl this agethe actress herself saybe allowed even to see this thing? Is whats onscreen a form of child abuse? Do we splutter in outrage or relax and dig the Grand Guignol spectacle? In schizoid fashion I both spluttered and enjoyed myself. Moretz has aplomb and when Cage underplays the monomania he reminds you what a droll comic actor he can be. Director-panderer Matthew Vaughn fetishizes the little girl and her virtuosic scissor-knife work the hyperbolic weaponry the can-you-top-this carnage. Theres even a teen-sex angle Johnsons nerd superhero pretends to be gay so he can have nonthreatening sleepovers with a luscious classmate. Kick-Ass is a compendium of all sleazy things and it sings like a siren to our inner Tarantinos. As she proved in her Sarah Palin impersonations Tina Fey has a gift for charting the continuum between vanity and insanity. On the posters for Date Night she stands beside Steve Carell in a gauzy blue party dress spattered with mud her hair splayed outbut with her right hand shes smoothing the ends in a cool sexy way. Thats what she does brilliantly the teensy neurotic (or obsessive-compulsive) gesture thats totally at odds with whats happening in the moment. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 09 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Date Night Directed by Shawn Levy Written by Josh Klausner Starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell Classification 14A Tina Fey is really funny. Steve Carell is really funny. Date Night stars Tina Fey and Steve Carell. Ergo Date Night must be really ... sorry I wish it worked that way almost as much as the studios do. But no. All that starring talent isnt exactly wasted here; its just diluted watered down enough to demote ""really funny"" to sort of funny now and then here and there some of the time. Hey its the movie biz. This much can be said for the script It dares to go where even Shakespeare feared to tread venturing beyond the wedding that ends the typical comedy and plodding on into the boggy territory of happily-ever-after-land - deep into a good yet weary marriage. And this much cant be said for the script Neither Tina nor Steve both fine writers had a hand in it. Alas Josh Klausner did a scribe who as his press notes boast ""did additional screenplay work on Shrek the Third."" Bravo Mr. Klausner. Anyway Tina and Steve play a self-described (more than once) ""really boring couple from New Jersey."" Supportive partners theyve got the demanding jobs the two kids the book club and a regularly scheduled ""date night"" that has come to seem like work too - even their getaways are routine. As for sex their foreplay requires foreplay mutually considerate chatter about whether to do it. After one such exchange decidedly anti-climactic Tina leans across the bed and politely offers ""I could rally."" See sort of funny although like all the pictures best lines she probably ad-libbed it. Unfortunately the ad-libs are intermittent and more unfortunately still are obliged to hang off a plot. So one evening the boring couple seeks to spice up date night by driving into Manhattan to eat at a hot new restaurant. Without a reservation they steal a latecomers table assuming their name and thus ushering in the ever-wacky Mistaken Identity yarn. Well goodbye boredom hello thuggish mobsters and crooked cops and bullets whizzing and cars careening. Apparently for the old married duo all this is new and interesting; Of course for the old moviegoer its just a different brand of boredom. No doubt the night leads the twosome on quite the merry ride. It takes them to a Central Park pond to flee the bad guys in a very slow motorboat. It takes them to the West Village to do more fleeing in a very fast Audi which locks bumpers with a very yellow cab which prompts a very long attempt to find a laugh in this automotive mating. It takes them on repeated visits to an apartment that houses a consistently shirtless Mark Wahlberg - Tina seems to enjoy that. It takes them to a strip club and a required bout of pole dancing - Steve does not seem to enjoy that. Mainly though it takes director Shawn Levy (of Night at the Museum infamy) away from where he should be going not tapping the talent at his disposal but yes diluting it. Happily once in a while the plotted mania pauses for a reality check whereupon Tina and Steve are freed to do some improvising again. Like when theyre broaching the subject of marital infidelity even of the fantasizing variety and a dutiful wife who is also a salaried worker who is also a harried mother comes clean about her unfaithfulness. ""Yes"" she confesses ""I sometimes fantasize about being alone."" Thats more than sort of funny because its more than sort of true. Amid the forgettable big-budget shtick of Date Night its the little moments that stick. One is just a passing flicker hardly registering on the screen but its my favourite a tiny yet telling detail from the portrait of a lasting marriage. The man looks with genuine affection deep into the womans eyes and noting his gaze she runs a finger quickly over her cheek before asking ""Do I have something on my face?"" Ah so love endures.

After all Steve Carell and Tina Fey are among Americas funniest folk. Hes an ""Office"" fixture. When that shows over shes trying to keep writers and boss Jack Donaghy in line on ""30 Rock."" So do the duo have chemistry in ""Date Night""? Absolutely. Does the often raunchy PG-13 comedy deserve them or serve their talents? Absolutely ... not. Directed and produced with broad strokes by Shawn Levy ""Date Night"" suggests that there comes a moment in making of a major release when the filmmakers and their studio handlers think ""Well we could make a deft comedy but why? The familiar will do the box-office trick just fine."" Perhaps that sounds cynical. The screenplay by Josh Klausner proves that the easy laugh isnt always the best. For every moment of sweet timing -- in particular Carells -- theres an equal and opposite moment of comedy-writing laziness. A snotty host at a ""hot"" restaurant? In New York City? Really? Claire and Phil Foster of Teaneck N.J. are a loving couple in a rut. Even their ritualized time away from their youngsters their ""date night"" has become a flat-footed dance of routine. They go to the same restaurant order the same food and then make each other smile with conjectures about the back stories of the other couples dining nearby. All of this changes when another couple (played by Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) confide at a frightening book club meeting theyre splitting up. If this seemingly happy pair can go south fret the Fosters how stable is their own marriage? After a long day as a tax attorney and real-estate agent as well as parents Phil and Claire find sustained friskiness in short supply. The film does a sweet job with the exhausted couples bedtime ""will we wont we?"" minuet. On Phils endearing whim they head into Manhattan for dinner at a overly popular restaurant. Even more impulsively Phil takes the reservation of a no-show couple -- the Tripplehorns. Alas theres a reason the Tripplehorns dont show. The Fosters naughty bit of identity theft plunges them into deep waters. The sharks include two corrupt cops a mobster (Ray Liotta) and other unsavory sorts. All the Fosters wanted was a dinner out. The dual case of mistaken identity -- between baddies and innocents -- at the restaurant is a laugh-out-loud scene. Like too many instances in ""Date Night"" however a fairly sublime moment turns familiar and ridiculous. There will be car chases way too much gunplay and yes a pole dance before the nights over. Music star Common and Jimmi Simpson team up as the bad apples in pursuit of the Fosters. Taraji P. Henson is a New York police detective. She suspects something is altogether too right with the Fosters. There is no good reason a movies leads should have the most nuanced performances. Yet for the most part ""Date Night"" asks only the expected from its other actors. One exception is Mark Wahlberg who appears as one of Claires former real-estate clients and phew a security specialist. The other bizarrely compelling turns belong to James Franco and Mila Kunis as an outlaw couple. They may live on the edge but the pair have more in common with the Fosters than they or the hapless suburbanites can imagine. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

A movie pairing Steve Carell and Tina Fey the Magic and Bird of TV comedy Date Night has a blank checks worth of potential.As it turns out Date Night isnt great. But its fine funny enough to keep you engaged. Who knows maybe in its post-theater life when it hits the cable-TV circuit and is on every five minutes and you have the chance to watch it 18 times in a month it will become one of those movies. You know the kind - think Forgetting Sarah Marshall - one of those movies that are full of little Easter-egg moments that you discover as you watch again and again and quote endlessly.As a movie that you get in a car and drive to a theater to see? Not so much.Director Shawn Levy and screenwriter Josh Klausner try to heighten the big-screen appeal of Date Night by introducing action-movie elements to the romantic-comedy formula. It has various gunfights and car wrecks culminating in maybe the most improbable and overlong car chase in recent movie memory. Movie Information Date NightRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Shawn LevyActors Steve Carell Tina Fey Mark Wahlberg Kristen Wiig Mark Ruffalo James Franco Common and Mila KunisRun time 88 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (sexual content crude humor)Synopsis Tina Fey and Steve Carell are a married couple that becomes the victim of mistaken identity in this comedy.More movies from GuideLive.comThis approach does have its high notes - Mark Wahlberg as a super-studly and ever-shirtless spy - but for the most part its just a lot of frantic sound and fury without much comic payoff. In this regard Levy reminds viewers that he did direct both Night at the Museum films.To the extent the movie works it works in the interplay between Fey and Carell. As a married-with-children couple trying to avoid becoming just another husband and wife sleepwalking through life ""Phil"" and ""Claire"" try to jazz things up with a night on Manhattan - hip restaurant maybe a little dancing. But a case of mistaken identity lands them on the wrong end of a gang of corrupt politicians and killers.At one point while scrambling up a fire escape Claire tells Phil ""Remember Im doing everything youre doing in heels."" The reference to the famous Ginger Rogers quote is funny and apt Carell and Fey really are like Fred and Ginger so smooth and sure-footed in their comic grace(lessness) and timing.The movie also uses some well-placed cameos as comedy booster rockets particularly James Franco and Mila Kunis (speaking of Forgetting Sarah Marshall) as Taste and Whippit a pair of low-life lovers who teach Phil and Claire valuable life lessons.Date Night may not set theaters on fire the way an adrenalized shot of transgressive mayhem like The Hangover did. But give it time and repeat broadcasts and it will likely insinuate itself - Carell twisting in unmanned discomfort as he tells the buff and bare Wahlberg to ""shirt up"" - into pop culture consciousness. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Starring Steve Carell Tina Fey Mila Kunis James Franco Mark Wahlberg Kristen Wiig Director Shawn Levy Release Opened Apr 9 2010  Editorial Review Funny? You bet your minivan its funnyBy Michael OSullivanFriday April 9 2010Every week on ""The Office"" and ""30 Rock"" Steve Carell and Tina Fey make us laugh at the inanities of the American workplace and the absurdities of network television.Just imagine what they could do with a stripper pole.In ""Date Night"" you dont have to imagine. The high point of the movie comes when the two actors -- he dressed in a cheesy nylon track suit she dolled up like one of Miss Kittys saloon girls -- encounter the aforementioned furnishing in the back room of a seedy New York sex club and proceed to disport themselves on and around it in as increasingly lubricious a manner as you are likely to ever see at least from these two normally buttoned-down performers. At one point Carell runs his tongue along the length of the shiny chrome shaft (germaphobes be warned).Like so much of this movie -- which follows the misadventures of a self-described ""boring married couple"" from New Jersey who are mistaken for blackmailers when they take someone elses reservation at a popular Manhattan restaurant -- it aint what Carell and Fey do; its the way they do it. How their characters CPA Phil Foster and his real-estate agent wife Claire even get to that stripper pole is less important than what they do with it when they get there.Regardless of the silliness of the situation -- or in truth because of it -- theyre a joy to watch.The premise of the movie is itself somewhat run-of-the-mill. Directed by Shawn Levy (""Night at the Museum"") from a script by Josh Klausner the story looks like just another ""The Out-of-Towners"" A couple of middle-aged fuddy-duddies get in trouble in the big city and spend 90 minutes going through contortions to clear their names to mildly amusing effect. In the hands of say a Greg Kinnear and a Sarah Jessica Parker the thing could be a disaster.Its not. Not by a long shot.Thats because Carell and Fey have something that no movie no matter how predictable can stifle. Its called chemistry but its not the romantic kind. Instead its the power that each of them has to crack the other up. One recurring gag involves Phil and Claire making fun of neighboring diners at their regular weekly dinners out. They never look like theyre worried about entertaining us so much as each other. Be sure and stay through the closing credits for outtakes of the two improvising these and other bits.Aiding Carell and Fey in their efforts is a talented supporting cast. That includes James Franco and Mila Kunis as the real blackmailers -- hilariously nicknamed ""Taste"" and ""Whippit"" -- along with Mark Wahlberg as a black-ops consultant whose help the Fosters seek.Hang on -- black ops?I know It doesnt make sense. It doesnt have to. All it needs to do is make us laugh.Contains obscenity plentiful crude humor and some gunplay.

Photo 20th Century Fox Licensing/Merch The brilliant improvisational skills of Steve Carell and Tina Fey -- plus their great chemistry together as a New Jersey couple being chased around Manhattan by a couple of thugs -- help make the generic action comedy ""Date Night"" a reasonably amusing way to pass Saturday night with a significant other. Fey and Carell are Claire and Phil an accountant and a real-estate agent with demanding jobs a couple of kids a large suburban house and a marriage that seems to have settled into a boring routine that includes brief obligatory sex. When he learns some friends of theirs (cameos by Kristen Wiig and Mark Ruffalo) are splitting up Phil who still adores his wife decides to spice things up by moving their Friday ""date night"" from the local bistro to a snobby Manhattan restaurant. PHOTOS TINA FEY AND STEVE CARELLS ON-SCREEN DATING HISTORY VIDEO DATE NIGHT REVIEW Unable to get a last-minute reservation he steals someone elses. Before you can say ""North by Northwest"" theyre having guns waved in their faces by the thugs (Common Jimmi Simpson) who mistakenly think Claire and Phil are a couple of blackmailers with incriminating evidence. What follows is basically a PG-13 version of ""After Hours"" with more than a bit of ""The Out-of-Towners"" thrown in. Its set in a largely unrecognizable Manhattan where motorboats glided through Central Park Greenwich Village townhouses come equipped with large underground garages and the traffic is so sparse that lengthy high-speed chases are actually possible. The derivative and predictable script provides showy amusing parts for a self-parodying Mark Wahlberg as a shirtless security consultant the couple turns to for help James Franco and Mila Kunis as a tattooed LES couple up to no good and Ray Liotta as a Mafia boss. Also on hand are William Fichtner as a kinky district attorney and recent Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") as a NYPD detective. Carell and Fey though carry the proceedings on their backs. These two brainy and attractive TV charmers deliver occasional zingers that rise above the generally dumb proceedings which include an impromptu dance at an erotic club thats funny almost in spite of itself. Its a tribute to the leads comic chops that they are completely believable as an overwhelmed suburban couple even when their characters behavior (two break-ins guys?) defies all logic. The inventiveness of director Shawn Levy (the ""Night at the Museum"" franchise) is basically limited to a gag involving a pair of conjoined vehicles. Levy does keep things moving at such a rapid clip that ""Date Night"" including the outtakes -- which run during the final credits and are funnier than anything in the movie -- is over in less than 90 minutes. Just before it wears out its welcome. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next The Misfortunates Read Next The Misfortunates Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16058 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Date Night Steve Carell and Tina Fey make date rate | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDate Night Steve Carell and Tina Fey make date rateChemistry between Steve Carell and Tina Fey as a ""boring couple"" who inadvertently tear up Manhattan makes silly but fun Date Night movie work.A ""boring couple"" played by Tina Fey and Steve Carell get more than they bargain for when they plan a night on the town.  (Myles Aronowitz)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 8 2010Date Night Steve Carell Tina Fey Mark Wahlberg Kristen Wiig and Taraji P. Henson. Directed by Shawn Levy. 88 minutes. At major theatres. 14ASilly sillier silliest.There is only one remotely believable thing in Date Night an action comedy that defies all laws of logic and physics. But its the most important thing.Article Continued BelowIts the chemistry between Steve Carell and Tina Fey playing a ""boring couple from New Jersey"" who manage to turn Manhattan upside down while supposedly enjoying a romantic night off from their kids and cares. Theyre mistaken for the prey of a New York mobster (Ray Liotta) and nobodys listening to any explanations.Watching Carell and Fey in action trading quips and dodging gunfire as they attempt to make their way home to white-picket-fence suburbia makes you wonder why its taken so long to bring these two gifted comics together. They click like a flamenco dancers heels.Date Night is the kind of movie that used to be called ""madcap"" back in the good ol days when all you needed for a hit movie were great leads strong cameos and non-stop frantic fun. Its a combination thats easy to describe but hard to find and you might have to go back 40 years for a good comparison. Im thinking of another madcap romp 1970s The Out of Towners which starred Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis as a squeaky clean Ohio couple lost on the greasy streets of Gotham.That film satirized the madness of modern life as does this one. But Date Night kicks it up an extra notch adding in the paranoia of the 21st century where nobody really wants to trust anybody because its all too easy to fake identities and concoct alibis.Thats the trouble awaiting the Fosters tax account Phil (Carell) and real estate agent Claire (Fey) when they uncharacteristically do something bold and impersonate another couple to gain access to a snooty restaurant. Hey the other couple failed to show so nobodys the wiser right?Wrong. Two toughs (Jimmi Simpson and rapper Common) interrupt the Fosters dinner asking them politely but firmly to step into the alleyway to discuss things. The Fosters learn that theyre wanted for more than two plates of falsely acquired seafood risotto.You can safely switch your brain off from this point in the movie as director Shawn Levy demonstrates why hes made so much money directing two installments of the Night at the Museum franchise with more surely to come. Hes a dab hand with comic action scenes a skill that reaches absurd heights here but hes been less successful with romantic comedy. His 2003 romcom Just Married featured Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy as American newlyweds on a European rampage didnt have half the sparks that Date Night effortlessly strikes.But its all mainly due to Carell and Fey who take the episodic script by Josh Klausner (co-writer of Shrek the Third and the upcoming Shrek Ever After) and use it as a springboard for improvised laughs.Tops amongst a strong supporting crew is Mark Wahlberg who satirizes his beefcake image by playing a shirtless playboy who also happens to be an military-trained identity sleuth. Hes more bemused than bothered as the Fosters drag him into the search for the real couple they need to unmask before they can get that mobster off their tails.There are also strong comic turns by Kristen Wiig as Claires nutty friend Taraji P. Henson as a querulous NYPD cop William Fichtner as a dubious Manhattan D.A. and James Franco and Mila Kunis as junkies whose love makes no sense at all.But then neither does Date Night which more than gets by on the strength of its manic match-ups.

"Movie review Date Night - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Movie review Date NightTina Fey and Steve Carell are funny sure but its an unfulfilled Date Night.April 09 2010|By Kenneth Turan FILM CRITIC gt;gt;gt; Think of ""Date Night"" as a half-a-loaf comedy. No its not set in a bakery but though it is funny it will likely leave you hungry for more as you consider the age-old perception that having half a loaf is better than none at all. If youve been anywhere near a moving bus or a stationary billboard lately you know that whats on offer on the plus side is the presence of a pair of supremely amusing people Steve Carell and Tina Fey. In both their television and feature work these two are phone-book funny They can make you laugh by reading anything at all. When you throw in their gift for physical comedy and their world-class reaction shots -- plus adept costars like Mark Wahlberg -- you know that theres going to be things here to make you smile. That said as written by Josh Klausner and directed by Shawn Levy ""Date Nights"" story of a romantic night in Manhattan that goes completely awry is fairly standard stuff. It is diverting and it gives these two their first chance to work together yet you cant help but wish that the film functioned on as high a level as its stars do. Carell and Fey play Phil and Claire Foster a self-described ""boring couple from New Jersey"" whose exhausting jobs in business and real estate and demanding young children leave them with precious little energy to keep the romance in their lives. That condition rises to the level of a crisis when a couple in their circle Brad and Haley Sullivan (a woefully underutilized Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) announce they are splitting up. What he and his wife have become Brad mournfully tells Phil is ""the most excellent roommates."" Determined not to let that happen to them the still-in-love Fosters decide to forsake their usual date night at the Teaneck Tavern in favor of an exciting evening out in Manhattan at a hot new restaurant called Claw. ""I want this night to be different"" Phil says and so it turns out to be. Claw is in fact so much the hot spot that the Fosters cant get a table. In an unusual act of bravado that becomes one of the films running jokes they take an unclaimed reservation by passing themselves off as a couple called the Tripplehorns. It turns out however that the Tripplehorns have come to the attention of big-time crime boss Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta) who sends a pair of goons to threaten them with death unless they come up with a flash drive that belongs to him. Not being the Tripplehorns and blocked by the script from confiding in the police the Fosters have no idea where to turn until Claire remembers hunky former real estate client Holbrooke Grant (a very funny Wahlberg) who just happens to be a security expert. The interaction between these three much of it involving Grants hot Israeli girlfriend (Gal Gadot) and his refusal to put on a shirt is the consistently funniest part of the film. Also good are the always reliable duo of James Franco and Mila Kunis as the real Tripplehorns. Sort of. All this is good as far as it goes but the problem is the good parts dont last long enough. Instead of keeping the film strictly funny director Levy who commissioned the script and whose credits include the audience-friendly ""Night at the Museum"" franchise becomes overeager for our approval with uneven results. Intent on touching as many cinematic bases as possible ""Date Night"" contrives some awkward and self-consciously poignant moments between Phil and Claire and the kind of super-elaborate car chase Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn would have had no part of. Its as if there are so few movies for adults made these days the filmmakers want to make sure no one in the theater feels left out. None of this would be troublesome except for the knowledge of how funny Carell and Fey are when the film is smart enough to use them well. This is vividly demonstrated in the outrageous gag reel outtakes placed at both the beginning and the end of the final credits. When we see what these two can do the feeling is inescapable that ""Date Night"" has left some laughs on the table. kenneth.turan latimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSmart List Steve Carell and Tina Fey in Date NightAugust 8 2010Date Night is no one-night standMay 17 2010For Tina Fey and Steve Carell Date Night rings trueApril 9 2010Steve Carell and Tina Fey could link arms again with...December 17 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewTina FeyEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-date-night9-2010apr09,0,2631928.story",200,datenight12,datenight,latimes
"Date Night reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Date Night reviewed. Date Night reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 8 2010 841 PM Date Night The funniest comedy of the year. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Date Night have a nightcap with our Spoiler Special discussion Tina Fey and Steve Carell in Date Night Date Night (Twentieth Century Fox) may be the funniest movie of the year so far--one-quarter of the way through a year thats been remarkably weak for comedies. This is a movie that Im inclined to grade on a serious curve because while it never achieves full-on laugh-riot momentum it gets one crucial element of comic filmmaking right in a way that few recent comedies have. Its cast down to the smallest role with genuinely funny performers people who understand how to time a joke deliver a setup underplay a deadpan glance. Though the material--an often-formulaic script by Josh Klausner directed by Shawn Levy of the Night at the Museum franchise--isnt always worthy of their talents Tina Fey and Steve Carell (and many of their co-stars including Mark Wahlberg James Franco and Mila Kunis) manage intermittently to elevate Date Night to giddy heights. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The films setup is belabored but the slow pace of the early scenes gives Carells and Feys characters a chance to emerge. Phil and Claire Foster are a middle-aged New Jersey couple he a tax accountant she a real estate agent whove settled into a domestic rut. From the moment their two small children dive-bomb their bed at 5 a.m theyre packing lunches settling quarrels cooking cleaning and working till theyre so exhausted they can barely drag themselves out for their once-a-week ""date night"" at the local Teaneck Tavern. Familiar as these early scenes feel--really couldnt directors just save time by inserting a title card that reads ""Imagine deadening suburbia here""?--the scene at the tavern establishes an important detail Phil and Claire enjoy one anothers company. Advertisement Looking around at the nearby tables they play a game in which they imagine their fellow patrons bizarre conversations and their ad-libbed non sequiturs crack them (and us) up. Knowing the Fosters are capable of having fun--theyre bored with their routine not with each other--sends us into the films second act with a rush of goodwill. When theyre snubbed by the maitre d at an achingly trendy seafood joint called Claw Phil and Claire impulsively claim the reservation of a no-show couple named the Tripplehorns. Soon two menacing-looking dudes (Common and Jimmi Simpson) show up to ask them to leave and assuming the jig is up Phil and Claire shame-facedly allow themselves to be hustled from the restaurant. Outside the thugs hustle them into a car at gunpoint shouting something about the ""flash drive."" As it turns out the Tripplehorns are scam artists involved in a dangerous (and overplotted) intrigue involving blackmail a mob boss and a crooked district attorney. Perhaps in the attempt to add some action-movie mojo to its middle third Date Night works far too hard to convince us that this ""wheres the flash drive"" business either makes sense or matters. All we need to know is that the bad guys want something theyre falsely convinced Claire and Phil have--the classic wrong-man setup straight out of North by Northwest. All the shootouts and car chases just take time away from what we really want to see which is how these two normal people react to the spiraling insanity of their situation. And of course how they interact with the characters they meet during the course of the night. James Franco and Mila Kunis get only one scene as the real (or are they?) Tripplehorns but they turn it into a hilarious and weirdly touching portrait of dysfunctional con artists in love. Mark Wahlberg--who Ive always maintained is better cast as a comedian than as an action hero--plays a perpetually shirtless black-ops expert who cant stop exchanging charged innuendo with Claire. The movies comic high point is a pole dance that Phil and Claire find themselves forced to perform for the corrupt DA (William Fichtner killing it in a tiny role) whos so deeply perverted he finds their hastily improvised ""sexy robot"" routine arousing. Its probably evident from the foregoing that watching Date Night is more like dinner at the Teaneck Tavern than an edgy evening at Claw. Its pleasures are comfortable and small-scale things like Fichtners delicious cameo as the horny DA or Tina Feys trick for following up a punchline with a mumbled analysis of why it fell flat. But in a moment when comedys principal gambit seems to be excess--more profanity more outrageous grossout gags more stunt casting--this movies sense of pacing and proportion is a welcome departure. The one place Date Night should have permitted itself more excess would have been allowing its actors more flights of fancy. Some of the biggest laughs in the movie come during the outtakes under the final credits in which Fey and Carell ad-lib variations on their lines each funnier than the last (and most funnier than the version that made it into the final cut). Comics this talented provide an exception to the axiom that a movie is only as good as its script With the right kind of on-set improvisation it can be made better. By boxing its lead couple into a conventional action story line Date Night throws away its chance to be the funniest movie of the year without any asterisk. Become a fan of Slate on Facebook.

Watch a clip from the film ""127 Hours"" starring James Franco. Video courtesy of Fox Searchlight. The title refers to the time it took Aron Ralston the real-life mountain climber played sensationally well by James Franco to extricate himself from a slot canyon into which he had tumbled during a solitary wilderness hike in Utah seven years ago. Extrication required amputation--Mr. Ralstons left-handed severing of his right forearm which was pinned between a chalkstone boulder and the canyon wall. Because this agony is depicted vividly albeit briefly you may go in with your eyes wide open but not keep them that way throughout. (My own approach was a combination of sidewise glances and defensive squints.) To justify such a harrowing sequence any mainstream movie would have to be exceptional and this one certainly is--its exciting stirring often funny sometimes lyrical and unusually thoughtful. And with that one egregious exception genuinely pleasurable. The film is an intriguing match-up of style and substance. On the face of it Mr. Ralstons experience which he recounted in his book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" would seem as confining for the camera as it was for the hero. (The book was adapted by the director and Simon Beaufoy.) And the feeling of confinement can be extreme. Against all physical logic were wedged right in there with Aron watching his struggles from a fairly hard place of our own. Yet that confinement co-exists with surreal freedom. Mr. Boyles gorgeously reckless ecstatic style --developed in such earlier films as ""Trainspotting"" and ""Millions"" as well as ""Slumdog Millionaire""--allows him to break out of the canyon with the greatest of ease by tapping into the flow of Arons memories fantasies fears and epiphanies. Thus his camera tilts skyward to see the slow transit of a raven that Aron saw every morning and drills down to the whirling video drum of the fallen climbers minicamcorder (or the point of his blunt knife as it approaches a bone inside his arm). Yet the camera also hurtles across a mesa at warp speed to the bottle of water that Aron recalls having left in his truck; constructs exquisite dreamscapes from cherished moments in his family life; revisits his lover whos played by Clemence Poesy and the pretty young hikers he chanced to meet just before his fall; studies voluptuous sandstone shapes and in a single literally breathtaking shot pulls up and out of Arons strait prison for a birds-eye view of the vast and silent land that surrounds it. (The directors of photography were Anthony Dod Mantle who shot ""Slumdog"" and Enrique Chediak. As in ""Slumdog"" A.R. Rahmans score drives the narrative with relentless force.) ENLARGE James Franco as stranded climber Aron Ralston in 127 Hours Fox Searchlight Visual and dramatic fugues notwithstanding the film is essentially a one-man show and Mr. Franco was an inspired choice to play the man. Theres no one quite like him in--or conspicuously out of--Hollywood these days. As a charmingly cheerful exponent of the Robert Mitchum screw-it-all school of acting he finds time to direct make fine art contribute articles to various publications (including this one) and is currently pursuing doctoral studies at Yale. But whats so valuable to his performance in ""127 Hours"" is his very American cheerfulness combined with quick intelligence. When Aron takes off for his fateful adventure his high spirits which the actor and his director convey brilliantly are an expression of his heedlessness--he hasnt bothered to tell anyone where hes going. Its entertaining in a foreboding way to watch this outdoorsman set out with equipment that John Muir could never have dreamed of--superstrong climbing ropes gleaming pulleys digital wristwatch-cum-altimeter a tiny Petzl lamp affixed to his cap. His cool gear gives him a seductive sense of security while his little still camera in tandem with his digicam will let him narrate what may be the last hours of his life. Thats not why the cameras went into Arons backpack of course. They were there because this is an age of ritual self-dramatization so entertainment becomes fascination as Mr. Franco charts Arons progression from happy narcissism to solemn awareness of mortal peril. And to an acceptance of personal responsibility ""Its me"" Aron reminds himself. ""I chose this. I chose all of this."" His solemnity seems just as authentic as the jauntiness it banishes which is saying a lot. (The only passage that struck me as false though enjoyable was one that makes indirect reference to ""Slumdogs"" game-show madness.) ""127 Hours"" treats profound issues with unforced wisdom and uncommon grace. The story is one of survival through almost unthinkable self-mutilation but the subject is self-discovery. By the time Aron raises himself up from the bowels of the earth into the blazing sun he knows who he is and we do too. Fair Game Watch a clip from the film ""Fair Game"" starring Naomi Watts. Courtesy Summit Entertainment Naomi Watts is Valerie Plame and Sean Penn is her husband Joe Wilson in ""Fair Game"" a political drama that explores the mysteries of the Washington scandal that erupted in 2003 shortly after the start of the Iraq war. Since Doug Limans direction is astute the acting is first-rate the script--by Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth--is smart and the story is an important one its also mysterious that the film is less than the sum of its well-crafted parts. Part of the answer lies in the storys peculiar nature. Anyone who saw ""All the Presidents Men"" let alone read the book or lived through the period can tell you what it was about--a pair of reporters whose revelations helped to topple Richard Nixons presidency. The same clarity cant be found in the source material for ""Fair Game"" which was based on the book of the same name by Ms. Plame and ""The Politics of Truth"" by Mr. Wilson. Theirs is an ambiguous tale of intrigue and betrayal culminating in her being outed as a CIA agent thanks to White House leaks that were widely seen as revenge against Mr. Wilson. (A former ambassador and career diplomat he had written a New York Times op-ed piece denying the truth of one of the Bush administrations most compelling justifications for invading Iraq.) ENLARGE Naomi Watts as the embattled Valerie Plame in Fair Game. Summit Entertainment More on ""Fair Game"" A Qamp;A with Valerie Plame Wilson and Joe Wilson A Qamp;A with Director Doug Liman ""Fair Game"" has its own chilling power accompanied as it is by a drumbeat about weapons of mass destruction that turned out to be nonexistent. Mr. Liman and his colleagues evoke that tumultuous not-so-long ago time with a documentary style that incorporates TV speeches by President George W. Bush Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (""We dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."") And the co-stars could hardly be better--especially Ms. Watts who must be the most agreeably self-effacing star in todays movie universe. Yet most of the scenes depicting the couples domestic life are borderline-banal and they miniaturize the political drama that plays out partly in public partly in the shadows but almost always in a middle distance just beyond emotional reach. Due Date Watch a clip from the film ""Due Date"" starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. Courtesy Warner Bros. Todd Phillips who put himself on the comedy map by directing ""The Hangover"" is back with ""Due Date"" a road movie with mismatched buddies played by Zach Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. Mr. Galifianakis was endearing as well as hilarious in ""The Hangover"" but Ethan the extravagantly fey goofball he plays this time soon wears thin--chubby but thin. Mr. Downey can turn anything into a laugh line but the character he plays here a father-to-be named Peter whos trying to get home in time for his childs birth is little more than a foil for his co-stars antics--a foil both angry and dull. ENLARGE Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis as mismatched road-trippers in Due Date. Warner Bros. Pictures The basic problem is the script which is credited to three writers plus the director--seldom a good sign. Never mind that its a retread of ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles"" minus the trains and minus John Candy. Retreads can hold the road but this one doesnt despite some sporadically funny stuff. What for example are we to make of Ethan confronted for the first time by the Grand Canyon saying ""I couldve sworn I read it was man-made""? Or mistaking Mexico for Texaco after getting himself and Peter high on cannabis clouds in the confines of their car? Jokes like these leave you yearning for less. Four Lions This media-obsessed comedy set in London and directed by Christopher Morris  is an adolescent stab at a grown-up subject. Its The Gang That Couldnt Bomb Straight a boob quartet of Islamic extremists--three Muslims by birth and a kind of soccer hooligan turned nutjob jihadist. (In a twist of whimsy offered as irony another young Muslim who comes on as a fanatic proves to be a passionate pacifist.) Mr. Morris and his writers--four of them in this film as well--like to torture logic with absurdist dialogue and some of their gangs escapades are amusing rather than laughable. Yet ""Four Lions"" lacks a moral base. If the terrorists are hapless clowns the cops are silly fools and the closest the movie comes to political satire is the terrorists penchant for videotaping themselves. The only reason to see it is Riz Ahmeds performance as Omar the supposed brains of the operation. Mr. Ahmed reminded me a bit of Robert Carlyle. Hes dynamic quick-tongued and intense. And much too classy for this tatty room. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Date Night (2010) ENLARGE James Francos breakthrough on the small screen came with a starring role in ""Freaks and Geeks."" On the big screen of course he came to prominence in the ""Spider-Man"" movies as Harry Osborn Peter Parkers best friend and the son of Spideys arch-enemy. In keeping with his unbedazzled attitude toward acting he has also played a wide range of lesser roles. In this comedy about the superbly absurd adventures of a suburban couple played by Steve Carell and Tina Fey Mr. Franco and Mila Kunis are a low-life duo named Taste and Whippit. Go (1999) Before Doug Liman directed ""The Bourne Identity"" he did this piquant bouillabaisse of nihilist comedy. Always leaping before they look the barely postadolescent blunderers of ""Go"" keep suffering dire consequences from dimly perceived causes. They may be many things--spontaneous irrepressible and pretty funny--but they arent poster children for impulse control. The prime mover is an 18-year-old supermarket clerk named Ronna (Sarah Polley deftly deadpan all the way). John August wrote the script set in Los Angeles and Las Vegas on the day before Christmas. Mr. Liman did his own cinematography as he did in ""Fair Game."" Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958) This leisurely sweet-spirited Italian comedy directed by Mario Monicelli was conceived as a spoof of the now-classic ""Rififi"" a mesmerizing French-language heist film directed three years earlier by the American Jules Dassin that created the template for decades of heist films to come. Mr. Monicellis take-off in its turn became the granddaddy of movies about bumbling thieves. The marvelous cast includes Marcello Mastroianni Vittorio Gassman Renato Salvatori and as a once-crackerjack safecracker closing in on senility the legendary clown Toto. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Its too plain too pale like a weatherman from New Jersey which is how he landed a supporting role in Anchorman. His features dont carry the comical devilishness of Jim Carrey or even the mischievousness of an Adam Sandler or Will Smith. If you were to run into him on a street corner oblivious to his fame you wouldnt turn back for a second. Hes too ordinary to make a lasting impression.All of this might work to his favor on the small screen where he plays the clueless boss Michael Scott on The Office. It should backfire on the big screen where everything is epic now and so 3-D. But comedy isnt a branch of mathematics--the formula actually works in reverse. The Office might have the critical backing and the Emmys but its a dwindling import that nobody will talk about in 10 years (do they still even talk about it now?). Its on the big screen that Carell has made his mark from The 40-Year-Old Virgin  to  Get Smart. Which brings us to the latest example Date Night.The premise is like Charlies Angels  without the angels a New Jersey husband (Carell) and wife (Tina Fey) go out for a peaceful dinner in Manhattan are somehow mistaken for a couple blackmailing a corrupt district attorney and spend the rest of the night on the run. If the stars had been--for example--Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler it wouldnt be worth catching even on TBS. But Carell is such the unusual film actor (he got his start on The Daily Show after all) that he can make even the most mundane line pop. Hes also unmatched when it comes to physical comedy--i.e. the chest waxing in the 40-Year-Old Virgin. Paired with Tina Fey (a writer who also played a fake anchor on Saturday Night Live) the movie easily succeeds as mainstream popcorn entertainment. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Has there been any other comedian at the movies who continuously takes a tired premise and makes it so delicious your gut hurts? (Or maybe it hurts from all the laughing.) Because Carell has such a gentle onscreen presence he brings out the best in his female leads. Who knew that Anne Hathaway had action-babe potential before Get Smart? Or that Catherine Keener could be so Julia Roberts-lovable in Virgin? He also transformed the normally dramatic Juliette Binoche in Dan in Real Life a better romantic comedy than anything Hugh Grant has done in the last 10 years. In Date Night Carell is the cake batter that holds up Feys icing. Their breezy banter is a throwback to old-fashioned movie stars which is funny since shes not a conventional movie star either. When she cast herself opposite longtime friend Amy Poehler in Baby Mama it was like watching an endless SNL skit.Carell might not get the onscreen recognition that he deserves--yet--but give him time. Like Ben Stiller hes a thinking mans comic with the potential for crossing over into drama. Stiller is now getting rave reviews for his performance as a tortured man-boy in the Noah Baumbach film Greenberg. But it doesnt seem so great when you compare it to what Steve Carell accomplished in Little Miss Sunshine. When Carells character appears at the start of the movie with bandages around his wrists from an apparent suicide attempt his eyes are full of sorrow in a way that almost makes you take a step back. Who knew that Steve Carell had such range? If he ever takes on Hamlet sign me up for a front-row seat.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Director Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum) tosses in a museum of cliches from gun battles to car chases. Theres even an embarrassing strip-club sequence in which both stars get to bump and grind. And I havent even mentioned the star cameos Kristen Wiig and Mark Ruffalo as soon-to-be divorcees from New Jersey; James Franco and Mila Kunis as the couple the Fosters impersonate to steal their reservation at a chic Tribeca restaurant; and Common and Jimmi Simpson as the hoods who want them dead. Best of all is Mark Wahlberg in a nifty bit of self-satire as a shirtless weapons expert. Still if youre thinking all the star shine sounds like padding youd be right. Date Night which superficially resembles Martin Scorseses After Hours is too soft to go for the turbulence roiling under this tamped-down marriage. But watching 30 Rocks Liz Lemon and The Offices Michael Scott spark each other is enough. Stay for the outtakes -- theyre improv delights suggesting the movie that might have been if they had just left it all to Carell and Fey.

Steve Carell and Tina Fey star in ""Date Night."" Photo 20th Century Fox Review Date Night 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Date Night Comedy. Starring Steve Carell and Tina Fey. Directed by Shawn Levy. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It helps in ""Date Night"" that Tina Fey and Steve Carell really do seem married. Theyre about the same age. Theyre equally good looking. They have a benign aura but with a sense of humor that sneaks up and stings in ways that the victim doesnt always know. And they seem very at home with each other like old friends - or like people who have been married for a long long time. Though ""Date Night"" doesnt aspire to be much besides being funny and providing a strong showcase for its two comedians it does one equally important thing up-front. Before it revs up the plot machinery it establishes the specific terms of the marriage. The Fosters live fairly well but both have demanding jobs and theyre too exhausted to invest much in the relationship. Because theyre both nice people they feel they should invest more and they are gentle with each other in ways that are comical and recognizable. A vacation (without the kids) might rekindle the romance but what they really need is an adventure - one to show them different sides of themselves and each other one to demonstrate that their marital functionality is up to challenges bigger than figuring out who drives the kids to school. Believing in Fey and Carell as a married couple gives the whole story a context. The movie takes them on a date from hell but that date serves the true purpose of date night more than just another meal at a restaurant. Yet alongside this theres the parallel fun - that of remembering Fey and Carell as a pair of gifted sketch comedians and of watching them ply their skill and play off their public images in concert with each other. Josh Klausner (""Shrek the Third"") wrote the screenplay but it really does seem as though some of its funniest lines were ad-libbed. Either that or Klausner deserves credit for tailoring a screenplay so completely to his actors so as to make it seem that they wrote it. The movie borrows a device straight out of Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest."" The Fosters a New Jersey couple wanting to jazz up their date night go to Manhattan in the hope of getting into a hot upscale restaurant. But they dont have a reservation and theyre treated like bridge-and-tunnel trash by the maitre d. Determined to get in anyway they take the reservation of a no-show couple and have a great meal - that almost turns into a last supper. It turns out that the no-shows - the Tripplehorns - have been targeted for death by mobsters and corrupt police. And now everyone thinks that the Fosters are the Tripplehorns. You know the evening has taken a turn when two thugs show up asking ""Did you really think you could steal from Joe Miletto?"" It gets even scarier Joe Miletto is played by Ray Liotta. Lots of the humor comes from the pairing of these square eminently sane suburbanites against the madness and violence of the city slickers. There are funny lines as when the wife worries aloud about getting ""whacked off"" by the mob - combining ""whacked"" and ""bumped off"" to get a phrase that doesnt quite mean what she thinks. And there are nice set pieces of physical comedy as when the two are forced to pose as erotic dancers and perform in a strip club. Mark Wahlberg has an amusing featured role as a government agent who looks like an underwear model and never wears a shirt. Best of all the filmmakers know when to pull the plug. ""Date Night"" clocks in at 88 minutes and would not have been as funny at 89. -- Advisory This film contains mild violence and sexual situations.

ABOUT THE MOVIEDate Night   1/2 (out of four)Stars Tina Fey Steve Carell Mark Wahlberg James Franco Mila Kunis Taraji P. Henson Ray Liotta Director Shawn LevyDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for sexual and crude content throughout language some violence and a drug referenceRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Tina Fey and Steve Carell make Date Night an absurd and wildly amusing night to remember. This is the rare screwball comedy that is superbly paced cleverly plotted and hilarious from start to finish. Fey and Carell are ideally cast. Their respective improvisational talents and razor-sharp comic timing make them one of the most engaging on-screen couples around. And their chemistry is palpable. Whether hashing out marital problems giddily running from the law enduring a harrowing car chase or staring into the barrel of a mobsters gun they nail it every time. Equally skilled in verbal banter and ridiculous physical gags neither is afraid to look ridiculous -- and both frequently do. TRAILER Get a taste of the mayhem INTERVIEW On the set with Fey and Carell BAD DATE? Share your horror stories with us They play Phil and Claire Foster an ordinary couple living in the New Jersey suburbs. Married with two children their well-ordered lives include weekly date nights. These consist of eating the same food at the same local restaurant their conversation drifting to imagining the more interesting lives of diners nearby. After hearing their best friends (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) are getting a divorce driven apart by their humdrum lives Phil and Claire are worried. So Phil decides to take Claire to the hot new Manhattan restaurant she has been dying to try. When the arrogant maitre d scolds them for not making a reservation months before they slink off to wait indefinitely for a table. Phil makes an impulsive decision and grabs the reservation for a no-show couple. Initially aghast Claire quickly embraces the notion. It turns out to be a terrible idea. The concept is a well-worn one A case of mistaken identity spirals out of control. Everything that can go awry does -- and then some. The story could easily have run adrift in formulaic silliness. What makes this action comedy work so well is Phil and Claires sensible mundane quality. Some of the best comedies involve average folks careening through a series of loopy misadventures. Think The Out of Towners After Hours The Daytrippers or Little Miss Sunshine. Here the alchemy of smart casting offbeat situations and clever dialogue creates an ideal fusion of concept process and players. Director Shawn Levy has left a trail of forgettable comedies in his wake. Among them What Happens in Vegas Just Married and Cheaper by the Dozen. But he strikes comic gold here with a script by Josh Klausner. Date Night is simply irresistible.

Their spot-on comic teamwork salvages this routine mistaken-identity comedy. Its still more a smiler than a laugher but without Steve Carell and Tina Fey the movie would be as boring as the drab suburban couple they play. Borrowing the premise of ""True Lies"" the film tells us theres nothing like a spate of gunfights and car chases to spice up a staid marriage. Phil and Claire Foster live in a state of quiet desperation New Jersey. Hes a tax accountant shes a real-estate agent and their life is mind-numbingly routine. Their scheduled ""fun"" activities include a tedious book club and date night at a steak joint where the waiter knows them by name. They are so exhausted from work and wrangling their over-energetic kids that their love life is a fading memory. The bedtime negotiation in which they let each other off the hook for not wanting to have sex is one of the films highlights. But when an effort to kick the excitement up a notch goes horribly awry their domestic tranquility starts to look pretty good. When they impulsively head off to a hot Tribeca restaurant and impersonate a couple of no-shows who had a reservation theyre swept up into a whirligig of comedy-thriller shenanigans. On the run from a pair of gunmen (rapper Common and Jimi Simpson) they cross paths with a shrewd police detective (Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson) a menacing mobster (Ray Liotta surprise surprise) and a couple of lowlife grifters (James Franco and Mila Kunis) whose relationship problems sound eerily like the Fosters. Mark Wahlberg contributes a self-mocking flashback to his days as a Calvin Klein underwear model. He plays a former client of Claires with a background in military security who takes a break from his own lusty date night to give the couple a hand. When he appears bare-chested at his apartment door Feys look of thinly veiled desire and Carells mortification are funnier than the scripts half-baked punch lines. ""Date Night"" is directed by Shawn Levy whose kiddie comedies ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" ""The Pink Panther"" and the ""Night at the Museum"" movies prove how lucrative inoffensive mediocrity can be. He doesnt know how to use his performers to their best advantage. DATE NIGHT  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual and crude content throughout language some violence and a drug reference. Carell and Fey are funny with their faces not their bodies and in physical comedy scenes where theyre supposed to be funny-awkward theyre awkward-awkward. A pole dancing scene in a strip club and a roll on the grass on their suburban doorstep are painful to behold. Fey looks as if half her concentration is going toward not toppling out of her high heels. Theyre great in close-ups though with years of TV practice. They can telegraph anxiety humiliation and exasperated affection in a glance. They give the film a boost even Levy cant deflate. ""Date Night"" does have one standout sequence of knockabout comedy though. Theres an extended scene of Fey and Carell racing through the streets in a pair of cars that have been mashed together grille to grille in a head-on collision. They shout directions at each other while pounding on the accelerator slamming the brakes and steering in opposing directions. Its a pretty good visual image for marriage if you ask me.

The man who thinks that his wife cant take a joke sometimes forgets that his wife took him.Date Night a tour-de-farce with Steve Carell and Tina Fey as a couple in a marital rut ticklishly ribs such maxims. Here are a mild-mannered New Jersey mom and dad - a Realtor and an accountant - confused for shakedown artists a case of mistaken identity that launches them on a Manhattan misadventure.As written by Josh Klausner and directed by Shawn Levy Date Night is the opposite of a madcap comedy. Given the thoughtful leads its definitely a sanecap affair. The marrieds lose their wits and find their wit - the quality that originally made them an ideal fit.The Fosters Phil (Carell) and Claire (Fey) are a painfully ordinary suburban couple stuck on the shoals of midlife. If you saw them at a restaurant youd no doubt peg him as a Boy Scout troop leader and her as a girls vice principal.Everyone else at the neighborhood taproom burns with sexual heat. The Fosters? They radiate . . . reliability. Phil and Claire worry about the impending bust-up of the couple theyre closest to (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) but cant share their anxiety because theyve each been sworn to secrecy. Their deepest fear is that theyve become friends without benefits.Usually they greet their scheduled date night with the enthusiasm one might bring to an IRS audit. Then one Friday Claire pours herself into a flirty cocktail dress and Phil is immediately inspired to take her to a trendy seafood place in Tribeca. When they pretend to be another couple in order to score a table they are mistaken for blackmailers in possession of an incriminating flash drive.With their matching deadpans and mirroring trick of speaking out of the side of their mouths Phil and Claire are all the more eccentric for their ordinariness. Carell and Fey mine the humor of predictable characters acting unpredictably - and frequently they strike gold.For Phils spreadsheet smarts and Claires Realtor composure prove to be forceful weapons in intimidating corrupt cops mobbed-up politicians and mobsters.From the evidence of the outtakes shown over the closing credits Carell and Fey ad-libbed much of their material. But if Klausners script didnt provide them with their best lines his well-constructed scenario provided them with a springboard for some thrilling verbal high-dives.And Levy whose heavy directorial hand in Night at the Museum earned him the rep as the McG of family film shows that he is capable of subtler effects. The visual humor of the unapologetically square Fosters sack-suited and cocktail-dressed hipping themselves out by wearing their clothes back to front is nicely done. (Still the sight of the Fosters performing a PG-rated pole dance in this PG-13 film may have been funnier in concept than in execution.)The funniest visual joke is an extended sequence where the Fosters stolen sports car is conjoined in grille-lock with an oncoming taxi.Instead of the obligatory car chase we get a slapstick metaphor of a stalled and unwieldy marriage. At first husband and wife are driving not with but against each other. Ultimately it takes both of them each behind the wheel of a different vehicle to synchronize their efforts and work together - which made me laugh and cry at the same time.In addition to Carell and Fey Date Night boasts a deft supporting cast that includes Mark Wahlberg well-used as Claires hunky ex-client Taraji P. Henson shrewd and sexy as a policewoman and Ray Liotta as a none-too-bright wiseguy. Best of all are a very droll James Franco and Mila Kunis as the downtown hipsters for whom the Fosters are mistaken.Date Night  (out of four stars)Directed by Shawn Levy.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + On their respective NBC shows -- ""30 Rock for her ""The Office for him -- Tina Fey and Steve Carell are two sides of the same coin. Their comedy depends on weathering humiliation. Their co-workers dont take them seriously as managers of people or hormones. Feys Liz Lemon has had to play dumb so long she might actually believe it. Carells Michael Scott actually is dumb. The joke is always against them.Ive always wondered why the cross-promotional minds at NBC havent figured out a way to get Liz and Michael together for an evening. It would go hilariously bad. ""Date Night -- a new movie that casts Fey and Carell as of all things long-married parents in suburban New Jersey -- is not what I had in mind. There are moments few of them funny. Heres some advice for screenwriters using ""Romantic Comedy for Dummies to shake up the genre Skip the chapter on couples on the run.""Date Night is another of those movies that jams the comedy of remarriage (or in this case the alleged comedy of rekindling) with the chase thriller. In the last five months Sarah Jessica Parker Hugh Grant Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston have all tried a formula that worked only when Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase were doing the running -- and almost not even then. Both romantic comedies and thrillers live by their screenwriting. A decent version of either is hard to come by. An entertaining combination of the two is tantamount to ambidexterity.At this point I would settle for a little monodexterousness. ""Date Night comes close then gives up in pursuit of a more obviously commercial movie. Fey and Carrel play the Fosters who decide to upend their routine night out with a spontaneous trip to Manhattan where they pretend to be another couple to get a table at a hot restaurant. Its complicated but the actual couple is mixed up with the mob.Theres promise right up to the moment the Fosters toast with empty glasses -- an omen of terrible luck. After a close-up of the clinking glasses were dragged into the movies Twilight Zone. The Fosters are chased all over Lower Manhattan by gun-toting automatons who cant seem to hit their targets even when theyre in a boat 15 feet away. We learn a scene or two later that theyre police detectives but theres no joke about how taxpayers cant even afford decent crooked cops. (One of them is played by the rapper Common an insinuating presence and promising actor whos a goony blank here.)""Date Night manages to live down to its store-brand title. But it might have worked as a serious comedy about two people trying to resex their marriage and air their mounting grievances. There are only ribald jokes at the hapless Fosters expense. (The only thing that scares American movies more than sex is sex between married people.)The filmmakers dont care about the nuances of marriage. And theyre not obligated to care but their alternative priorities -- car crashes shootouts ""Cannonball Run pileups and city-government scandals -- are like something out of a ""Police Academy sequel. The chase does turn up blips of laughter with a shirtless Mark Wahlberg and a couple played by a shamelessly skuzzy James Franco and Mila Kunis (Mark Ruffalo Kristen Wiig Taraji P. Henson Leighton Meester and Ray Liotta also have small empty parts).Fey and Carell are at their best when they break the character and flash some satirical leg making fun of restaurants or strip clubs or celebrity. Its amazing how these two famous people are still convincingly disdainful of fames trappings and observant of certain annoyances and everyday realities. Lousy movies of course are some of those annoying realities. And for now theyre as doomed to star in them as we are to watch them.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Date Night amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Square The Joneses >> Date Night Is it because Steve Carell is so likable that Hollywood always casts him as a goon? A dork is fine--hes made his reputation with dorks--but post-40 Year Old Virgin hes played a series of mouth-breathers. Date Night isnt a good movie but his character is the right direction. In it Carell is allowed to be an actual leading man not a subversion of one. Hes handsome and capable--a man who gets laid on the regular--even though once again his innate kindness is spun to mean effeminate. Carell and Tina Fey make great fictional marrieds. Fey makes credible a comic strip swirl of emotions shes brave but insecure tomboyish but jealous a control freak who wants her man to take control. They get along so well as people that you can always understand why these two people got hitched a core premise thats shockingly absent from most spousal trauma sitcoms. Smartly writer Josh Klausner hasnt framed them as spiteful; their biggest fears arent adultery or hatred its that theyve become just ""excellent roommates."" But other than setting Carell and Fey free to improv some of their best lines thats the only smart move Klausner and director Shawn Levy make. Once the plot gets underway and Fey and Carell must dodge baddies (Common and Jimmi Simpson) whove mistaken them for thieves its easy to see that this flick is just a skeleton praying its leads will bring it to life. They have kids (Jonathan Morgan Heit and Savannah Paige Rae) who barely register best friends (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) who vanish--even the crooked couple who gets them into this mess (James Franco and Mila Kunis) disappears after one scene. In place of these very funny talents were given...car chases? And shoot outs? And a long scene where Fey and Carell dance the Robot at a mobsters strip club? Talk about playing against your strengths. Date Night proves that Fey and Carell can do anything--even crack jokes while dodging bullets in Central Park. But they shouldnt have to. And forcing them to carry a half-baked rom-com action flick is the worst torture of all.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Date Night Steve Carell and Tina Fey play a fundamentally solid married couple who have been together long enough to take each other for granted. Having traded the electricity of new infatuation for the security of sleepy middle-class suburban parenthood this complacent pair looks for a shock to the system to revive their relationships dormant romance. And thats just what they get once they venture into the city for a night of danger violence and slapstick shenanigans in Shawn Levys thoroughly okay action-comedy. The suburban New Jersey couple begin their travails when Carell impulsively decides to impersonate a mystery pair known as ""the Tripplehorns"" in order to steal their reservations at a hip discriminating Manhattan eatery. But hes unaware that the real Tripplehorns are low-life hustlers (James Franco and Mila Kunis) wanted by unsavory sorts on both sides of the law. Soon Carell and Fey are running for their life from corrupt cops (Common and Jimmi Simpson) and seeking regular help from a scene-stealing Mark Wahlberg who--playing a James Bond-like acquaintance of Feys whose glamorous existence and impressive pectoral muscles make Carell look milquetoast by comparison--mounts a serious challenge to Matthew McConaugheys reign as the King Of Cinematic Shirtlessness. Though it often defaults to flailing slapstick wedded to rote action Date Night occasionally stumbles onto moments of emotional honesty when the subterranean currents of resentment and boredom in Fey and Carells marriage puncture the surface. In one of the films sharpest gags Franco and Kunis flat-lining relationship woes serve as a funhouse-mirror reflection of Fey and Carells own issues except in the younger couples case they involve handjobs in champagne rooms instead of driving kids to soccer practice. Yet whenever the film threatens to develop real comic momentum or pathos it grinds to a halt for arbitrary thriller mechanics that recall the glut of gratuitous diamond-smuggling comedy subplots of the 1980s. Theres something genuine and more than a little sad at the core of Levys poorly staged modestly amusing comedy but it isnt the part that involves flash drives blackmail and glowering gun-toting bad guys.

(20th Century Fox) Joe Neumaier Thursday April 8 2010 321 PM Title Date Night Halfway into ""Date Night"" theres a scene in which Tina Fey and Steve Carell playing boring suburbanites stuck in a madcap mistaken-identity Manhattan misadventure try to sneak past the hostess at a swanky restaurant. Feys hair is lying on her face Carells is all poofed up and both of them are wearing their clothes backward to look ""hip."" Its unexpected casually hilarious and exactly whats right and wrong about this wannabe-wild comedy. When youve got two of TVs funniest performers front and center you dont need much to make things click. So some of ""Date Nights"" best moments are simply Fey and Carell quipping deadpanning or bantering often all at the same time. And the duo are fine in the movies early bored-with-their-lives moments. The trouble is too much of director Shawn Levys 80s-ish lark is filled with noise when it really needed more quietly silly stuff. Carell and Feys Phil and Claire Foster are frazzled New Jerseyans tired of their usual work/kids/collapse from exhaustion routine. Phils plan for a fun night in the city goes awry when they steal the dinner reservation of another couple. Saying theyre ""the Tripplehorns"" Phil and Claire get a table -- and lots of trouble. Turns out the actual Tripplehorns are in the midst of an extortion attempt that involves a tough mobster (Ray Liotta who else?) a dirty D.A. and a pair of crooked cops. Now the Fosters have to dodge bullets as they try to solve the blackmail scheme and shake the bad guys. Screenwriter Josh Klausner apparently didnt trust them to do that on their own so there are several visits to a buff ex-commando (nicely underplayed by Mark Wahlberg) with high-tech surveillance equipment that drives the story. Its only one of many unnecessary distractions that Levy (""Night at the Museum"" ""The Pink Panther"") leans on during the 92-minute running time. Another is a bickering twosome (James Franco and Mila Kunis) who are sort of a skank-universe version of Phil and Claire. Theres also a monotonous car chase featuring a screaming cab driver that belongs in a 1985 time capsule. But then the whole movies ""dangerous New York"" conceit feels ""After Hours"" and premillennial. Through it all Carell and Fey are charming and sly and even manage to be genteel while bumping and grinding through a strip-club routine. Neither of them are joke hogs; as in their previous big-screen efforts theyre happy to toss laughs back and forth (this should however be as high-concept as Carell gets -- meaning no more ""Get Smart"" shtick). The two of them absolutely work. Its just a shame theyre all dressed up with nowhere to go. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Comments Date Night Video Rated PG-13  88 minutes  2010 Tina Fey and Steve Carell star as a bland suburban couple whose night on the town turns dangerous when theyre mistaken for another couple who happen to have evidence incriminating a popular politician. If the end-credit outtakes are any indication Fey and Carell improvised about 90 percent of their dialogue which is clever enough but also weirdly disjunctive--as in a Bob Hope vehicle the threatening situations are constantly belied by all the easy quipping. The action plotting is quick and clean though and there are some funny supporting turns from Mark Wahlberg as a perpetually shirtless security specialist and James Franco and Mila Kunis as the bickering young couple who hold the key to the mystery. Director Shawn Levy delivers his usual middle-of-the-road product (Cheaper by the Dozen The Pink Panther Night at the Museum); with Ray Liotta William Fichtner Taraji P.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; date-night ) Date Night (United States 2010) April 07 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres a reason why so many action/comedies are failures. This is as true for more obvious misfires like The Bounty Hunter and Cop Out as it is for minor infractors like Date Night an affable but ultimately forgettable example of the genre. In too many cases the films are designed primarily for their comedic value with the thriller/action elements shoehorned in as filler. Invariably this means that the chase scenes shootouts etc. are obligatory and uninteresting and often seem to be obstructing more interesting aspects of the story. Successful action/comedies are typically developed primarily as thrillers with the humor layered on top. Date Night comes uncomfortably close to The Bounty Hunter at least insofar as its ""high concept"" goes a married couple rekindle their romance while fleeing from a group of gun-happy bad guys. Its hard to argue that the screenplay for Date Night is more clever than that of The Bounty Hunter but its nearly a half-hour shorter (which is a blessing) and features tangible chemistry between the leads. Steve Carell and Tina Fey click in a way that Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston dont. That more than anything is why Date Night proves to be tolerable whereas The Bounty Hunter is something of an endurance trial. Phil and Claire Foster (Steve Carell and Tina Fey) are a happily married couple whose marital intimacy has been reduced to occasional ""date nights"" as a result of the pressures represented by two careers and two children. On one such date night Phil decides to try a walk on the wild side and take Claire to a trendy new Manhattan restaurant without making the necessary month-in-advance reservation. As the Fosters hang around the bar waiting for a table to open up they hear the hostess repeatedly calling for ""the Tripplehorns."" Correctly deducing that the Trippehorns are not on the premises Phil decides to steal their reservation. The tactic works out well for a few minutes - until it becomes apparent why the Tripplehorns stayed away. A couple of intimidating bad guys - Armstrong (Jimmi Simpson) and Collins (Common) - arrive to retrieve ""the flash drive"" from Phil and Claire - something they dont have. Chases and other examples of staple action mayhem ensue until the Fosters determine that the only path to safety lies in obtaining the flash drive from the real Tripplehorns and handing it over to (a) the cops (b) no-nonsense DA Frank Crenshaw (William Fichtner) or (c) NYCs current mob boss (Ray Liotta). For help they go to a laid-back ex-secret ops guy named Holbrooke (Mark Wahlberg) who rarely wears a shirt has a history with Claire and is involved with sexy Israeli woman who wants to know if a foursome is in the cards. The scenes that dont feature car chases Mexican standoffs and other assorted action devices are mostly enjoyable. The set-up will be familiar to many suburban moms and dads whose nuclear families have not fallen prey to dysfunction and the keenly observed humor in everyday married-with-children situations is expressed in a manner that exaggerates only slightly for effect. Take away the silliness of the mobsters and their crooked cop allies and Date Night might work as a big-screen sit-com - an arena in which both Carell and Fey have shown themselves to be capable. The pleasure to be found here is in watching the stars interact not seeing the stunts and special effects. Even in the midst of the films action sequences theres time for a pleasant interlude in which Phil and Claire contemplate their marriage - its a gem that reminds us how enjoyable the movie can be when it switches into a lower gear. Unfortunately director Shawn Levy may not understand how to do action effectively but that doesnt stop him from trying. Carell and Fey have been surrounded with an interesting and high-profile supporting cast. Jimmi Simpson and rapper-turned-actor Common portray gun-toting villains who are a bit more serious than the typical action/comedy bumblers. Taraji P. Henson is the police officer who wonders why a couple from the suburbs has become mixed up in crimes across the city. Mark Wahlberg who spends most of his screen time bare-chested acts a little spacey. Recognizable names with small parts include Ray Liotta (frothing at the mouth as usual) William Fichtner Mark Ruffalo Kristin Wiig Mila Kunis and James Franco. As dynamic as the duo of Carell and Fey might be they prove unable to reverse the trend of padded and forgettable action/comedies. Nevertheless they lend a degree of panache to an unremarkable script that allows Date Night to go down smoothly. No one is going to remember the movie in a month (or in many cases the day after seeing it) but for Mommies and Daddies seeking a nights break from their children its adequate entertainment.

Steve Carell and Tina Fey are thoroughly believable - endearing even - as a happily married couple fighting off a bout of the midlife blues in Date Night. The pairing of the television comedy titans may seem like a gimmick but Carell and Fey genuinely seem to like each other and they bounce off each other with the natural chemistry of ... well an old married couple. The early scenes in Date Night which depict the day-to-day routine of Phil (Carell) and Claire Foster (Fey) as they juggle careers with raising their two adorably boisterous kids in suburban New Jersey should be all boring set-up. But some of the funniest stuff in the film comes out of that exposition. Carell and Fey play their characters completely straight but they inject great observational humor into their depiction of an ordinary couple leading ordinary lives Theres a considerable ring of truth to the look on Feys face when its time to get up in the morning or the way Carell collapses on the couch after arriving home from work begging his kids for just a couple of minutes before he plays Lego wars with them. But once the guns come out and the car crashes begin Date Night loses the funny. The movie was directed by Shawn Levy whose previous work (Night at the Museum The Pink Panther Cheaper By the Dozen) could be used by Websters to illustrate the definition of the term ""hack for hire"" and the script is credited to Josh Klausner who previously wrote the soul-crushing Shrek the Third. Like Whats Up Doc? Foul Play and Into the Night Date Night is a hybrid of romantic comedy and action picture built around some flimsy instance of mistaken identity. The film depends on the fact that Phil and Claire do not do the logical thing when thugs start chasing them up and down Manhattan after they steal someone elses reservation at a trendy restaurant. But the actors have already shown us how smart and relatable their characters are so you cant ever buy into the premise. You suffer through the dull contrivances of Date Night for the scenes in which Carell and Fey are given room to riff and to do their thing. Fortunately there are a lot of such moments (the blooper reel that plays over the end credits implies the films biggest laughs were all improvised). Theres a great running gag involving the Fosters repeated visits to the bachelor pad of an ex-super spy (Mark Wahlberg) who never seems to have a shirt on as well as a terrific scene in which the couple breaks into the apartment of two hoodlums (James Franco and Mila Kunis) who dont appreciate being held at gunpoint by a pair of suburbanites. Date Night is littered with funny moments - its a lot more amusing than the trailer suggests - but the movie must eventually surrender to its irrelevant plot and Levys impersonal direction and you leave the theater satisfied yet strangely displeased. Thats what happens when good actors are stranded in a lame movie that is not worthy of their talents. Carell and Fey deserve better material Heres hoping they get another chance to work together soon. Date Night (1/2 out of ) opens Friday March 9 at South Florida theaters.

(Myles Aronowitz) B Date Night Starring Steve Carell Tina Fey; Starring James Franco Mark Wahlberg; Director Shawn Levy; Author Josh Klausner; Release Date Wide 04/09/2010; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted April 7 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT In their respective hit television series The Office and 30 Rock Steve Carell and Tina Fey play neurotic characters who are amusingly single -- his Michael Scott and her Liz Lemon are in their distinctive ways pathologically bad relationship material in a world built for couples. Yet the appeal of both gifted comics is rooted in emotional maturity. Carell and Fey (each married in private life each a parent) project an intellectual sharpness and an understanding of whats important in life -- and whats ridiculous -- that are the hallmarks of endearingly sane adults capable of sustaining both a hot career and a warm marriage-with-children. Date Night a robustly overbusy caper comedy in which Carell and Fey play a too-settled suburban mister and missus embroiled in unsettling urban mayhem draws smartly on its stars considerable strengths. As the characters wiggle their way out of scrapes during a bizarro night in New York City the actors hold steady as grownups a rarity in a world of rom-coms about flighty girls and lost boys. And as a result even when the action veers into tedium the leads provide their own excellent entertainment. Box office champ Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum) directs this soft-edged all-American couples comedy with a nod of the chin to TV sitcoms and a tip of the hat to William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles in their Thin Man movies. The movie is a Walter Mitty fantasy for the modern kids-playdate set. As extensive TV advertising has already made clear Carell and Fey play Phil and Claire Foster happy if bored married New Jerseyites with two midlevel careers two kids and a weekly ""date night"" at a local suburban eatery thats as predictable as an episode of The King of Queens. But when Phil seizes on the couples-therapy-approved notion of perking up their marriage with dinner at a Manhattan hot spot the result of his thoughtful gesture is a case of mistaken identity that leads to a rendezvous with corrupt cops mobsters thieves and -- scariest of all -- imperious restaurant maitre ds. In the way of such adventures in wonderland one close call turns into another and husband and wife come to see each other in a new light Phils not the downtrodden wimp he appears to be on the surface; Claires the Tina Fey-ish wry babe weve known she was from the start. Cool costars in small roles include William Fichtner as a sleazy DA James Franco and Mila Kunis as a couple of grifters Ray Liotta as a gangster (what else?) and Mark Wahlberg in a buff and funny homage to his shirtless Marky Mark days as a handy shadowy ""security expert."" For kicks Kristen Wiig and Mark Ruffalo have a tiny pointed bit as divorcing Jerseyites. Id love to see these two in their own his-and-hers caper based on Hepburn and Tracys Adams Rib. Meanwhile in the way of such escapades the action is broadly stupid -- dully routinely smash-automobiles-up stupid as Levy and screenwriter Josh Klausner attend to the needs of an imaginary audience segment. Who comes to a comedy starring Steve Carell and Tina Fey raring for a slapstick car chase in which Carell shrieks ""Waaaaaa"" like hes Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone? Theres no fear that Phil and Claire wont survive their dangerous night on the town. No worries either that their marriage wont be strengthened by their own personal After Hours experience during which the Fosters will learn that the grass is plenty green right where they are in New Jersey (a magical Garden State indeed in which Gossip Girls Leighton Meester moonlights as a babysitter). Date Night is a conservative comedy with mainstream values and easy-to-follow lessons. (Lesson one Dont steal somebody elses reservation at a Manhattan hot spot) But with Carell and Fey collaborating the movie becomes far more interesting than its plot or structure. Phil is a kind resourceful appreciative husband and father. Plus hes funny. Claire is a quick-witted adaptable perceptive wife and mother. Plus shes funny. For this 21st-century Nick and Nora Charles the flame is kept alive despite his nighttime anti-snore nose strip and her nighttime bite guard -- thanks to a shared appreciation of the hilarity of nose strips and bite guards.

Date Night Fair Director Shawn Levy. Cast Steve Carell Tina Fey Mark Wahlberg. Rating Rated PG-13 for sexual and crude content throughout language some violence and a drug reference. RELATED Off with their shirts Spotlight Steve Carell Sexy and funny Good thing because without them ""Date Night"" would be an unqualified disaster. Even with them its an uneven proposition veering wildly from genuinely funny scenes directly into ridiculousness and back again. But every time Shawn Levys movie makes that journey its harder to get back on solid footing. Carell and Fey so funny as the stars of ""The Office"" and ""30 Rock"" respectively play Phil and Claire Foster a stereotypical busy married couple. Hes a tax consultant shes a real-estate agent and they typically work themselves to exhaustion every day before feeding their kids collapsing into bed and starting the whole routine again the next morning. (Very realistic by the way.) They do manage a weekly date night and after learning that their friends (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig funny in little more than cameos) are splitting up because their marriage has gotten stale and predictable Phil and Claire decide to spice things up. They venture from their home in New Jersey to a pretentious seafood place in New York (Claw where they answer the phone by saying ""Claw youre welcome.""). Adrift without reservations they steal those of a no-show couple. Big mistake. Aside from being branded socially unacceptable (a running joke) theyre set upon by a couple of thugs (Common and Jimmi Simpson) who thinking Phil and Claire are the people who are supposed to be at the table want the immediate return of a flash drive that belongs to a mob boss (Ray Liotta). Thus begins a chase that takes the Fosters through Manhattan which includes a stop at the apartment of a buff former client of Claires played with winning bemusement by Mark Wahlberg who never quite manages to put a shirt on. Better still is a stop by the apartment of the real couple who had the Claw reservation Taste and Whippet two stoners hilariously played by James Franco and Mila Kunis who act out a low-rent version of the frustrations and stagnation thats been nagging at the Fosters marriage. Its the best scene in the movie. Unfortunately it leads directly into the stupidest car chase in memory. But not as it happens the stupidest scene in the movie. That comes soon after when Phil and Claire have to perform a pole dance for a twisted district attorney (William Fichtner nicely sleazy). Maybe it sounded good in the script but its flat and ridiculous onscreen not funny at all. Too bad. There is some funny stuff here particularly the asides between Carell and Fey who have a comfortable chemistry. You can certainly believe that theyre a harried married couple. Its harder to believe that they would stop in the middle of literally running for their lives to have the classic ""you dont appreciate me"" argument. That they conduct it in an engaging way is one of many examples of them rising above the material. Levy tries to bring some sense of edge to the story but its fake smoothed out for easy consumption. If only hed taken more real chances then ""Date Night"" might have been something more than just a series of hit-and-miss set pieces with funny people in them. But Carell and Fey are good enough together that one good idea could come of it crossover episode Better that than a sequel. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

A romantic comedy with action edge and genuine chemistry between its leads ""Date Night"" scores a home run. As a suburban couple whose evening out goes disastrously wrong setting off a boisterous Gotham pursuit Steve Carell and Tina Fey are ideally suited both to each other and to the material. Helmer Shawn Levy (""Night at the Museum"") tempers his customary flair for action with an unexpected capacity for warmth making an uncommonly engaging date movie that should also score at the box office. From their deadpan comedic styles to their brunet good looks Fey and Carell are so well matched it seems almost inconceivable that this is their first onscreen pairing. As Phil and Claire Foster a couple whose marriage is overrun by the demands of their energetic kids and their exhausting work schedules theyre like your neighbors. And in a sense they are having been in most of our homes already Currently fronting two of NBCs workplace sitcoms Carell (""The Office"") and Fey (""30 Rock"") both benefit from the audiences familiarity with their personae. So when they discover that their good friends Haley and Brad (Kristen Wiig Mark Ruffalo) are splitting up largely out of boredom Phil and Claire decide to take a night out to rekindle their romance. Arriving at the absurdly elitist eatery Claw theyre told they have no chance of a table; when another couple fail to arrive for their scheduled slot Phil spontaneously opts to assume their name -- the Tripplehorns -- and snag their table. That fateful decision sparks a series of events that veer from mildly uncomfortable to truly alarming but never lose their sardonic edge. When two thugs (Jimmi Simpson Common) show up insisting the ""Tripplehorns"" accompany them to a dark alley Claire is more concerned with preserving her risotto but it soon becomes clear these guys mean business. A brush with a lethal weapon and an involuntary trip to the Central Park Boathouse are only the beginning of their woes The night leads them into contact with a quizzical police officer (Taraji P. Henson) a shirtless security agent (Mark Wahlberg relishing the role) and a tattooed glue-sniffing young couple (Mila Kunis and James Franco). Rounding out the cast are William Fichtner as a D.A. in the Eliot Spitzer mold and an uncredited Ray Liotta as a Mafia boss. Technical elements are fine throughout with particular credit due the staging of a car chase that raises the bar for sequences of this sort. With a script credited to Josh Klausner (a writer on the upcoming ""Shrek Forever After"") ""Date Night"" also reaps obvious dividends from Fey and Carells comfort with improvisation (as the outtakes during the closing credits make clear); their verbal dexterity easy banter naturalistic charm and in particular willingness to mock themselves help forge an immediate alliance with the audience. And when Fey delivers a monologue about the exhaustions she feels as a working mom women watching will nod their heads in agreement. At times pics domino-style series of spontaneous adventures gallery of unsavory characters and brushes with peril suggest a lesser version of the nocturnal black comedies ""After Hours"" or ""Into the Night"" -- but those were rated R and this one is resolutely PG-13. Thats a little too bad as it would be fun to see where Fey and Carell could really go if let loose and if ""Date Night"" had even further embraced its edginess. Nevertheless its a date worth making.
