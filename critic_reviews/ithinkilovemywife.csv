"I Think I Love My Wife Think again | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesI Think I Love My Wife Think againChris Rocks I Think I Love My Wife asks us to consider why a nerdy New York investment banker would want to cheat on his smart and sexily beautiful wife with a self-absorbed stage-four clinger who despite being easy on the eyes puts his job and family life in jeopardy.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. March 16 2007  (out of 4)Starring Chris Rock Kerry Washington Gina Torres Steve Buscemi. Written by Chris Rock and Louis C.K. Directed by Chris Rock. 94 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowChris Rocks I Think I Love My Wife asks us to consider why a nerdy New York investment banker would want to cheat on his smart and sexily beautiful wife with a self-absorbed stage-four clinger who despite being easy on the eyes puts his job and family life in jeopardy.But the bigger question is why would a superbly talented stand-up comic be so discontent with his lot that he feels compelled to write and direct movies - and one so disappointing as I Think I Love My Wife?Saddled with the weight of an unfocused cliche-ridden script a tiresome voice-over narration that drones on and on and acting by Rock thats as wooden as Pinocchio I Think I Love My Wife staggers in predictable circles for 94 long minutes.In this remake of New Wave French director Eric Rohmers 1972 film Chloe in the Afternoon Rock abandons his trademark grin and dons serious suits and wire-rimmed glasses to play Richard Cooper a Wall St. up and comer who has a huge home in the burbs two adorable kids a gorgeous wife Brenda (Gina Torres) and a stagnant sex life.""Im bored out of my f--kin mind"" complains Richard.Enter Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington) a buddys ex-girlfriend who swears she only wants to be friends.She shows up at Richards office almost daily in flimsy frocks demanding time and attention.Who knows why shes so relentless (the movie never tells us) but Richard is naturally flattered - tempted. Nikki gets busy showing the married man how much fun hes missing with antics like tossing dollar bills from his skyscraper office to watch the mad scramble on the sidewalk below. They go for lunch. They hang out. She uses the n-word with flair - a word that shows up with jarring frequency second only to the f-bomb which gets dropped constantly. Predictable scenes ensue. Theres the chance meeting in a lingerie store where Brenda is buying sensible undies and Nikki is picking up a couple of tea-bag sized thongs. A Viagra-gone-wrong episode follows. And of course Richard finds the only pharmacy in the world where condoms are still kept behind the counter - and its staffed by a clerk with the voice of a foghorn.Rock falls flat repeatedly in his new ""serious actor"" persona despite drawing from the kind of marriage-is-hell material thats been the foundation of his brilliantly funny stand-up routine. The one bright spot in I Think I Love My Wife is the delightfully hangdog Steve Buscemi as George the office philanderer who tries to make Richard see sense about the risky game hes playing with Nikki as big deals start to crumble at the office. Richard is experiencing all the guilt and danger of an affair without any of the sex - although Nikki keeps pushing and Richards resolve is wavering.Will he or wont he? By the time the pivotal scene unspools were long past caring.

"Chris Rocks buppie romantic comedy. Slate Sign In Sign Up Chris Rocks buppie romantic comedy. Chris Rocks buppie romantic comedy. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 16 2007 118 PM Chris Rocks Buppie Angst I Think I Love My Wife should have been funnier. By Dana Stevens Chris Rock and Gina Torres When Chris Rock decides to direct co-produce co-write and star in a remake of Chloe in the Afternoon a 1972 Eric Rohmer film about the adulterous temptations of a married man you know going in that youre in for something raunchy explicit and devoid of the subtlety of the French original. But the most shocking thing about I Think I Love My Wife (Fox Searchlight) isnt the language the sex or the racial humor. Its the fact that its not a funny movie. At all. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Im still puzzling over the notion that Rock--who just the other night as a guest on the notoriously self-serious Inside the Actors Studio was making me laugh about twice per minute--is even capable of making a movie this unfunny. Especially with a script co-written by Louis C.K. whose sadly short-lived HBO sitcom Lucky Louie actually did what this movie only proposes to do bluntly dissect the preposterous institution of marriage. But then Lucky Louie had a real female human being in the cast Louies shrewd foul-mouthed wife Kim played by Pamela S. Adlon. I Think I Love My Wife plonks two paper dolls into the ""place girl here"" slots Gina Torres as the nice-boring-sexless-schoolteacher wife and Kerry Washington as a gorgeous tramp who goes by the Prince-worthy name of Nikki Tru. Advertisement These two inert cutouts stand around symbolically while Rocks buppie investment banker Richard Cooper agonizes in perpetual voiceover about the possibility of an afternoon liaison with the tantalizing Nikki. Said possibility presents itself almost daily as the girl hangs around his office in chicly revealing outfits taking him out for long lunches and asking for inconvenient and possibly dangerous favors Could he hop on a plane to help her move out of her gangster ex-boyfriends apartment? Could he come to a nightclub and meet her latest crush a guy known only as Compassion? Any resemblance to Chloe in the Afternoon ends with this setup square-bait married dude contemplates nooky with trouble-gal only to reaffirm his marriage at the last minute (and if you think that constitutes a spoiler just read the movies title). I Think I Love My Wife is a bland formulaic romantic comedy with really creaky--I mean Vegas-creaky--jokes about frigid wives crazy nymphos and God help us Viagra which is the occasion for a cringe-inducing boner gag that like Nikki herself shows up uninvited and then far overstays its welcome. There is at least one moment in the film that gets a legitimate laugh when Rock does a bit about women who dress too provocatively on the subway platform. This openly nasty rant is funny because it resembles Rocks stand-up style which uses his natural sweetness as a foil for the expression of some really hostile and aggressive impulses. During Rocks best stand-up moments you go ""Wow this nice guy thinks like that?"" Unfortunately the rest of I Think I Love My Wife tamps down that aggression just enough to let it leach out in the form of laugh-free misogyny. Rock is such a gifted comedian that its painful to watch him chafe in this physically and emotionally restricted role. He looks uncomfortable in Richards conservative suits and ties and his usually mobile face is oddly stiff and blank. Kerry Washington (Ray The Last King of Scotland) seems to be having fun vamping as the purring Nikki but her part is almost nonexistent Every opportunity to explore what motivates this woman to behave like such a needy manipulative jerk is thrown away. Steve Buscemi as Richards aggrieved co-worker George is a trooper as ever--that guy could enliven an eight-hour documentary about sewage--but hes barely used while a potentially suspenseful subplot about Nikkis ex (played by The Wireselectrifying Michael K. Williams) is inexplicably discarded after one scene. The one novelty this film brings to the reaffirmin-my-marriage comedy subgenre is the fact that it concerns black people--black people whose upscale Westchester existence makes them nearly indistinguishable from white protagonists in a similar movie but black people nonetheless. Rock has a few interesting observations about race that set his characters apart from the usual romantic-comedy suspects For example when cataloguing the predictable topics of discussion at an all-black dinner party Richard lists Michael Jackson and the condemnation of gangsta rap. As part of her haranguing Richards wife gets after him for using the N-word around the kids. But these moments serve as decoration in a movie that has little else on its mind than how fine Nikki looks in her lingerie and high heels. Not that Im taking Rock to task for failing to take on the whole of American racial politics in a little sex comedy. He doesnt have to be any blacker or whiter angrier or nicer than he already is I just want him to be funny. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Movie review ""I Think I Love My Wife"" with Chris Rock Kerry Washington Gina Torres Edward Herrmann Steve Buscemi. Directed by Rock from a screenplay by Rock and Louis C.K. based on the Eric Rohmer movie ""Chloe in the Afternoon."" 94 minutes. Rated R for pervasive language and some sexual content. Several theaters. To sum up ""I Think I Love My Wife"" Marriage is boring. But that doesnt mean you can stray. Thats essentially the movie for 94 long minutes. Chris Rock (who also directed and co-wrote) plays Richard Cooper a Manhattan investment banker with a lovely wife named Brenda (Gina Torres) two cute kids and an elegant home in the suburbs. Hes bored because Brenda wont have sex with him anymore -- all she wants to do is watch home-improvement shows on television and to discuss maybe getting a minivan. Enter Nikki (Kerry Washington) a hip-swinging breasts-pushed-up-to-the-sky perpetually smoking temptress who long ago used to date one of Richards friends. Shes Brendas opposite and shes got her sultry eyes fixed on Richard. Will he stray? Will we care? This would-be comedy which borrows its premise from Eric Rohmers 1972 film ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" is a bit like ""Fatal Attraction"" but without the sex and without the bunny boiled on the stove. In other words in depicting a boring marriage it gets pretty boring itself. Rock is a very funny standup comedian but a mostly one-note actor. As a director he never finds a way to pop ""I Think I Love My Wife"" free from its predictable course. It just plods along Nikki and her cleavage keep showing up at the office Brenda and her cardigans keep falling asleep on the couch and a frustrated Richard dances between them torn between making himself happy and doing the right thing. And as a writer Rock -- with collaborator Louis C.K. -- never makes the film funny enough. There are bits that work some of which feel borrowed from Rocks routines a dinner out with another couple turns into a discussion of Michael Jackson (the one subject on which everyone -- male or female white or black -- has an opinion); a sprightly fantasy in which Richard imagines what single life would be like. (He bops along in a park cheerfully asking beautiful women ""Would you like to have sex with me?"" ""Sure"" they reply.) But the comedy that works is overshadowed by the ""comedy"" that doesnt work most notably an extended Viagra joke that culminates in a medical intervention that should have the men in the audience cringing. In the end ""I Think I Love My Wife"" has little to say (other than that men shouldnt stray from their boring wives just because well hip-swinging women who smoke in nonsmoking areas are bad news) and it doesnt have enough laughs to work as pure comedy. Rock the writer/director isnt doing Rock the actor any favors here nor is he doing many for the audience.

But wait -- who is that? 1 / 2 Back to Gallery I Think I Love My Wife Comedy. Starring Chris Rock Kerry Washington Gina Torres and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Chris Rock. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to SFGate.com/movies.) More married couples than would care to admit are likely to relate to ""I Think I Love My Wife"" a mostly sweet-natured comedy about the titillation of adultery. Chris Rock stars as a suburban family man who can honestly state ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman"" -- a hottie from the past who pops back into his life determined to mess it up -- although hes obsessed with the possibility. Rock can be seriously funny but his sharp-edged humor hasnt translated well on the big screen until now. He makes his character Richard Cooper likable as well as comical so youre prone to forgive him his lustful feelings. As writer director and producer Rock presumably had near total control over his latest vehicle and hes made intriguing artistic choices that dont always work but deserve credit for their audacity. To begin he adapted ""Wife"" from the most unlikely source since Jane Austens ""Emma"" became the basis for the teenybopper favorite ""Clueless."" For his inspiration he chose ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" -- a 1972 French export from cerebral director Eric Rohmer consisting of a lot of talk about the intricacies of relationships and almost no action -- and stuck surprisingly close to the basic story line. Like the French husband Richard pines for his single days and imagines all the fun hes missing. His ""Chloe"" is named Nikki and its apparent shes a bad girl from her entrance holding a cigarette up to her tempting lips. Kerry Washington proves herself a most-convincing femme fatale. Her Nikki is an eyeful turning up at Richards office in outfits that leave little to the imagination. His prim schoolteacher wife (Gina Torres in a thankless role) is no match especially since raising their children while continuing to work has left her with zero energy for sex. Did I mention that a lot of married folks will relate? Onto this romantic triangle Rock and co-writer Louis C.K. have grafted an insightful sidebar on survival tactics for upper-middle-class blacks in a predominantly white culture. Richard is an investment banker in a stuffy Manhattan firm that reeks of old money. When a black bike messenger crams into an elevator full of employees and starts loudly mouthing the lyrics consisting primarily of obscenities to a song on his headphones Richard scurries to the back to distance himself from the only other person of color. A co-worker (Steve Buscemi proving hes still the master of the deadpan expression) is a notorious ladies man whos managed to escape office gossip. But once Nikki starts calling Richard at work and making her presence felt its all anyone at work can talk about. The movie subtly implies that Richard is being held to a higher standard. Rohmers film distinctly lacked belly laughs while the new version offers jokes aplenty -- too plenty perhaps. Richards ongoing monologue delivered in voice-over has the ring of Rocks stand-up act. At one point he bemoans the limitations of ogling women in suburbia saying ""If you stare at soccer moms too long theyll post your name on the Internet."" You expect a pause to allow for the audiences laughter. A director other than himself would surely have restrained Rock from going overboard with shtick like Richard being afflicted with a dreaded side effect of Viagra. (Hint The ads warn you about it.) In another unlikely episode at a restaurant Richard struggling to control his sexual longings becomes irrationally angry when he and his wife are served by a waitress in a very low-cut top. He dashes over to the maitre d and yells at him ""Is this Hooters? Cause if it is you owe me some f -- buffalo wings."" Its a funny line for a comedy skit but implausible that someone like Richard with his instinct to blend in would ever say it. Rock might have gotten away with this and the Viagra scene if theyd been presented as fantasies. Instead they take you out of the movie. As uneven as ""I Think I Love My Wife"" often is it still has an emotional resonance lacking in most films about relationships. By dealing with temptation in even a quasi-realistic way it affirms that like comedy monogamy is hard. -- Advisory Sexual content and language.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Sunday March 18 2007 1239 PM View the photo gallery Read also Rock solid I Think I Love My Wife Comedy about a married New York banker who has a case of the seven-year-itch and a hot-to-trot friend anxious to scratch it. With Chris Rock Kerry Washington. Director Chris Rock (130). R Language sexual content. At area theaters. Director co-writer and star Chris Rocks ""I Think I Love My Wife"" may be the first movie to turn the Cialis four-hour erection warning in its TV ads into a comic set piece. But is that enough to satisfy Rocks audience? Could be. Its a very funny sequence starting with his character - New York banker Richard Cooper - popping a Viagra (I guess Cialis wouldnt pony up the product placement fee) after a romantic dinner with his wife and finding her sound asleep when he gets to bed. Four hours and some standout sight gags later hes in an ambulance being treated by a female paramedic for severe priapism. (Men there is a long needle involved so heed those warnings.) I wish the movie could hit that high with some consistency. But for each joke that is fresh there are at least three that fall thuddingly flat. Rock suffers a problem common to comedians moving from sketches to features - he cant quite get his performance level above caricature. To his credit he has made more of this than youd expect from the lame premise. Cooper is a one-time party boy now two kids into a marriage that has turned cold. Hes got a bad case of the seven-year-itch and everywhere he looks are women with the power to cure. In particular there is Nicky (Kerry Washington) a serious hottie from his past who hasnt settled down. Sensing his vulnerability she comes on to him with a fury that would scare away men twice as horny as he is. Most of the movie is devoted to Coopers ability to resist Nickys temptations while being helpless to stop her from leading him around Manhattan like a beagle on a leash. With his marriage and even job finally on the line will he summon the strength to ditch Nicky or surrender to her totally? Again there are moments along the way that lift this up and the singsong ending discovers a surprising nuttiness that is both sentimental and laugh-out-loud funny. If you get that far with a smile on your face youll float out of the theater. At this point though Rock is a filmmaker-in-the-rough. His movie overlaid with his unnecessary narration poses as a sophisticated comedy with black central characters who will cross over to white audiences. The Coopers - his wife (Gina Torres) is a teacher - live in upscale Westchester County and their friends are equally well-educated and affluent. But Rock cant resist the rank vulgarisms and epithets (both the F and N words flow freely from the soundtrack) that the R-rating allows him and which he obviously believes is expected of him. If hes right and the movie draws both his HBO and concert fans and the crossover audience there are a lot of moments where only half the crowd will be laughing. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Photo Fox Searchlight I Think I Love My Wife 1 / 2 Back to Gallery In I Think I Love My Wife Chris Rock plays Richard Cooper a guy whos got it all high-paying job palatial house angelic children and a gorgeous wife who fixes him lovely dinners most of them chicken. The only problem is they dont have sex. Brenda (Gina Torres) doesnt want to have sex; shes either tired annoyed or her face hurts. Plus Brenda wears massive panties which rank somewhere between floral house dresses and plantar warts on the cinematic sex-o-meter of comparative hotness. Richard tries to persuade her into lacy thongy things but no dice. As a result Richard is bored. The qualifier he uses to emphasize his boredom cannot be printed here but the upshot is a high incidence of the blahs which he expresses by ogling dishy women on the train to his Manhattan job as an investment banker. And wouldnt you know one day a dishy woman materializes in his office flirting her little red dress (just about) off making suggestive comments that drive Richard to the point of distraction or -- could it be? -- adultery. He then spends the rest of the movie approaching this same tiresome point noodling around with a curvaceous vixen while his job and marriage suffer. Just her name should trigger an alarm Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington) a club-hopping tease with a porn-star name. Shes bad news baby and so is the film. Rock directed and co-wrote (with Louis C.K.) I Think I Love My Wife from Eric Rohmers classic etude on marriage and temptation Chloe in the Afternoon updating their source with sitcom timing and bountiful bad words. Not much of it is particularly funny despite Rocks ubiquitous presence and a jaded effigy of Steve Buscemi as Richards philandering but happily married boss. There are a few bike-messenger-in-elevator gags and the N-word gets tossed around during perfunctory cracks at race-savvy humor. Viagra makes a lasting cameo. In one scene Rock goes ballistic over white meat; in another he sings. Rock the director (last at the movies in the less-bad Head of State) controls the camera squarely but cant get a handle on tone. Rock the actor wears the role like its choking him his starched shirts and power ties cramping far more than his style. The man we know and love as Chris Rock is nowhere to be found The lopsided smirk isnt cocky the staccato huffing is gone. Washington a stand-out as a grieving lover in The Dead Girl does up the sex-bomb bit with a full range of kiss-me pouts and sky-high heels while Torres guards the domestic front with a brave grin as big as her bloomers. Periodically Buscemi oozes in on a glaze of corporate wisdom issuing pronouncements on marriage and life. Despite its talented cast narrative compactness and provenance in the French New Wave I Think I Love My Wife slogs through drama and comedy as though both were a duty as onerous as a sexless marriage. Rarely do characters display anything approaching logic unless their 180-degree turnarounds are part of a geometry proof. Rarer still are moments when Richards plight connects in any realistic or meaningful way with the eternal human struggle for monogamy -- and hot sex. ""To be honest"" Richard whines in narration contemplating his booty-free existence ""I dont know how much more of this I can take."" He thinks he loves his wife? Thats nice -- ambivalent but nice.

A successful investment banker in New York he forgoes lunch for efficiencys sake. He also likes to wander taking pleasure in late afternoons in Manhattan. Hes been married to Brenda a lovely schoolteacher for seven years. They have two kids. Richard is quick to let the audience know in a voice-over that grates more than charms that they are no longer having the sex that made that possible. They visit a therapist who gives them the sort of advice Richard might consider if the woman offering it and scribbling notes knew what she was talking about. But hey shes not hitched. Yes Richards experiencing a seven-year itch. Watching him scratch it is about as much fun as watching your dog suffer with fleas. Chris Rock the man who plays Richard in ""I Think I Love My Wife"" is a stand-up comedian. This fact weighs heavily on the often shrill comedy. Directed and written by the talented comic the movie suffers from the overblown notes of a punch-line-driven routine. Rock and co-writer Louis C.K. based their film on the 1972 French film ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" about Frederick - a faithful if fantasizing businessman - who begins a precarious flirtation with an old acquaintance. Theres something lovely about Rock finding in the last of Eric Rohmers ""Six Moral Tales"" an opportunity to say something fresh about middle-class life and marriage for the hip-hop (and beyond) generation. And ""I Think I Love My Wife"" should be treated as a failed experiment more than a crass disaster. Rohmers film is wry and meditative and oh so French. It begins with a rumination about reading. Fredericks girl-watching is tinged with musings about a woman (his wife) Woman (the ideal) and the women he encounters in Paris. Rocks fantasies are more booty call than contemplative. Had Rock made Richards hankerings less immature his comedy would hit truer notes. As it is Richard is a more pathetic than empathetic character. He may chalk up his wandering lust to boredom but too often it has the markings of arrested development. If you see Rohmers picture for the first time after ""I Think I Love My Wife"" youll be struck by how unglamorous Chloe is. Not so her counterpart in Rocks film. Kerry Washington (""Ray"") plays Nikki the woman who shows up out of the past and tips Richards world over. Gina Torres holds down the fort as wife Brenda. Years earlier Nikki drove Richards best friend to the brink. When she arrives unannounced at the offices of Pupkin amp; Langford she looks like an escort. Dressed for seduction morning afternoon or night Nikki is meant to put the hint of doubt in the title. But Washington has to work too hard against her skimpy wardrobe to add layers to her character. Steve Buscemi plays Richards philandering colleague. Never troubled by his dalliances hes intended to remind us and Richard that he is truly the better man. Ultimately the responsibility for convincing us of this rests with Rock. But Richards piercing tone makes him more than an unreliable narrator. Hes a hysterical one. And that doesnt mean funny.

"Rocks Wife is not a marriage made in heaven - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Rocks Wife is not a marriage made in heaven By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 16 2007 Chris Rocks comedy ""I Think I Love My Wife"" is based on Eric Rohmers 1972 study of fidelity ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" the last and least of the French directors six moral tales. Its an inspired stretch for the comedian; if only the movie were as stinging as his stand-up. ""Wife"" is more alert than the first film Rock directed the mild political satire ""Head of State"" but its failure is fascinating almost willful.Rock who wrote the film with Louis C.K.  plays Richard Cooper a Manhattan investment banker and father of two whos bored with his suburban life. The sex is gone from his marriage to a schoolteacher named Brenda (Gina Torres ) and his primary outlet for that frustration is sexual fantasy. In his narration he rhapsodizes about the beauties he sees on the commuter train in the park and on the streets. He dreams of being single and all the lewd ways he could tell a strange woman hed like to have sex.He wants to cheat but presumably the opportunity hasnt fully presented itself. Then suddenly it does in the body and spirit of Nikki Tru  whom Kerry Washington plays as a mysterious aperitif of fun danger ditsy elegance and desperation. The character has no real human traits. Shes a figment turned nuisance. But Washington gives her a degree of depth that I wish a filmmaker would really do something with. The actress is capable of so much more than looking scrumptious. Nikki shares a first name -- and more -- with the temptress of a certain vulgar Prince classic. Bodaciously attired (her sleeveless red dress with the empire waist is a stunner) and frequently paired with a cigarette Nikki would seem to be the ideal opportunity for Richard to alleviate his frustration. Yet he doesnt. Instead they just hang out.Recently back in New York Nikki is the long-ago ex of an old friend and her life appears to be a mess. Her every inexplicable visit to Richards office brings skepticism from his co-workers (including a sleazy Steve Buscemi) and new requests for favors. Richard can you write me a job recommendation? Can you help me look for an apartment? Can you help pack up my old place? (This requires a last-minute trip to D.C.)The idea seems to be that Nikki is a blessing and a curse. One minute shes getting Richard to trade iPods with her (she loves the Foo Fighters). The next shes getting him beat up by her current ex (Michael K. Williams  Omar Little from the most recent season of ""The Wire"") and nearly fired from work. Shes a nut.Brenda the wife meanwhile is left to wonder whats gotten into her husband. Hes using the N-word around the kids and playing air guitar in the living room. Suddenly its like Rock is redoing the Kevin Spacey part in ""American Beauty."" But the film isnt about the angst of middle age or the stress of a marriage on the fritz not really. Nor is it a remake of Rohmers marital delicacy so much as a correction. Men dont choose not to have sex with women Rocks movie says. Women chose not to have sex with men and this makes men crazy. Rohmer was fairer to the wife in his movie. Torres is good in Rocks but the part requires her to be prim enough to make Richard feel naughty in the presence of Washingtons freak.""I Think I Love My Wife"" is actually a long version of Rocks great bit about old sex versus new ""New [sex]"" for instance ""is illiterate"" The point of that joke is love the one youre already with. Of course to get to that in the movie we have to sit through one absurd Viagra sequence (Richards unstoppable erection requires an ambulance) and a trippy song Rock and Torres lip-synch to each other.Rock could be making movies as culturally sharp about loves vicissitudes as Woody Allen or Albert Brooks . Lord knows he has Allens same knack for whimsy and Brookss exasperated wit. Surely there must be a dozen little urban satires vivid social X-rays of black America or painfully funny essays on the nature of all things extramarital lurking in this man. Despite the trappings ""I Think I Love My Wife"" isnt one of them.The movie instead is a work of giddy self-sabotage that seems determined to matter and not matter at the same time. For every perceptive observation about marriage (one dinner sequence about the sad social fate of married buppies is outstanding) there are two knowingly atrocious ones that feel like scenes from C.K. and Rocks cult-classic blaxploitation gag ""Pootie Tang ."" Its Rocks prerogative to goof off but hes too smart to just throw scenes at the camera. Richard thinks he loves his wife. Rock appears to think he loves filmmaking. How many more of these indifferent exercises until he knows for sure? Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"I Think I Love My Wife | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; i-think-i-love-my-wife ) I Think I Love My Wife (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Upon occasion cinema can make for strange bedfellows. Consider for example I Think I Love My Wife. This relationship comedy marries the sensibilities of French New Wave auteur Eric Rohmer with the youth-friendly sometimes raunchy humor of Chris Rock. Yet as strange as it might seem the unlikely juxtaposition works. Putting aside The Departed I Think I Love My Wife represents one of the best re-makes in recent years and its because rather than merely regurgitating Chloe in the Afternoon Rock adopts the framework of the story and some of the key ideas and reworks them for a new audience in a different culture. The focus has changed but the essence remains the same. Richard Cooper (Chris Rock) is a happily married man. His wife Brenda (Gina Torres) is a great companion cook and mother. Theres only one problem - theyre not having sex anymore. This causes Richards eyes to roam and his imagination to wander - not that he would ever do anything to endanger his seven years of wedded bliss or so he thinks until Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington) enters his life. Eight years ago she was the squeeze of a buddy and he hasnt seen her since then. Now she wanders back into his circle of friends with the force of a hurricane. He begins meeting her daily for seemingly innocent dalliances - quick lunches errands and visits to an auto show. Soon however it becomes clear that Nikkis intentions are not so innocent and Richard despite his resolve to remain faithful is weakening under her seductive influence. One of the best things about I Think I Love My Wife is that the film takes the time to develop the three principals beyond the stereotypes that underlie the characters. Brenda is more than just the tired wife who has lost her sexual appetite - shes a woman balancing motherhood and career and she feels that her husband doesnt appreciate her difficulties. Nikki isnt a scheming vixen - shes trying to figure out life and love and what it means to be the oldest women on a club scene dominated by twenty-somethings. And Richard is torn between desire and temptation as represented by Nikki and stability and comfort as represented by his family. Rock develops Richard as a three-dimensional individual by underplaying the character. Its a smart move by the writer/director/actor and it humanizes the protagonist. Theres chemistry between Rock and both of his co-stars. His on-screen relationship with Torres is companionable and occasionally thorny. He and Washington sizzle their interaction crackling with unresolved sexual tension. Steve Buscemi and Edward Herrmann have supporting roles as Richards best friend and boss respectively. I Think I Love My Wife is more serious than what one might initially expect from Rock although elements of his comedy are sprinkled throughout. (The Michael Jackson stuff in particular.) Generally however this is a serious (although not somber) effort. It represents a mature movie made with an older audience in mind. However there are a couple of bizarre missteps that are at variance with the overall tone. In one scene Richard ingests a Viagra tablet hoping to boost his sexual performance. The resulting series of mishaps is the kind of thing one might expect from an off-color TV sitcom. Then theres the final scene in which the characters unexpectedly break into song at a most inopportune time. It is - to say the least - an odd way to end the movie. Chloe in the Afternoon made in 1972 as the last of Eric Rohmers ""Six Moral Tales"" concentrates on the definition of infidelity. The movie asks a seemingly simple question with a complex answer Can there be infidelity in the absence of sexual (physical) contact? This question remains in the background in I Think I Love My Wife. Here Rock is more interested in examining how a modern marriage can survive the pressures that threaten if from within and (especially) without. In doing so he has crafted a persuasive and intelligent motion picture that should have appeal beyond his core audience. (In fact the degree to which it will appeal to his target demographic is an open issue.) What is missing in depth and philosophical intent is compensated for with humor and humanization.

"I Think I Love My Wife Married but Looking washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies I Think I Love My Wife Married but Looking Chris Rock and Gina Torres as a married couple who want different things -- or do they? -- in the unconventional romantic comedy. (By Phil Caruso -- Fox Searchlight Pictures Via Ap) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 16 2007 He says Please. Please? Pleasepleasepleaseplease She says Dont you ever think of anything else? On that fault line exactly is sited Chris Rocks ""I Think I Love My Wife"" -- that moment in a marriage (seven years being the legendary benchmark) when somehow her sexual heat has eroded under the friction of motherhood career and the general complexity of living. To him thus cut off the possibilities of something more exciting hotter younger or well what the heck older baggier sleazier dirtier just for crying out loud different have never seemed so enticing. The movie which Rock directs stars in and wrote with Louis C.K. as a modern take on Eric Rohmers 1972 Frenchie ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" chronicles the misadventures of the married man who seems to have it all and who is tempted to chuck that all for something more exciting but must ultimately decide which is more important frolic or family? Its for the child-man in all guys and its very funny in a cruel sort of way because its so tough on that most delicate of subjects the complete folly of the adult male particularly when certain poisonous masculine toxins have been released into his blood and its all rushed down here rather than up there. Rock plays Richard Cooper prosperous investment banker suburban dad with beautiful wife beautiful kid beautiful house completely fulfilled except ""I am so [bleeping] bored"" as he proclaims in voice-over. His wife Brenda (Gina Torres) is just too tired too often. Their sex life has turned into the big sleep. Someone might say Hmmm isnt that what massage parlors are for? But not Richard. He just walks around in a kind of state that might be called ""dazed arousal."" His eyes roam scan -- searching searching searching -- and fix when he spots a woman he finds attractive. He imagines intimacy exploration liberation the fabulous sex of damnation and betrayal. It feels so good because its so wrong (I assure you this could never refer to me; I just heard about it from some of the fellas.) Still hes a dreamer not a hustler until . . . enter stage left on cue bad girl. Shes an old college friend Nikki Tru (equally beautiful Kerry Washington) all lips eyes curves and availability. Shes between jobs between men and ""just wants to be friends."" I suppose feminists have a right to be offended at this portrait of a gal on the make and Washingtons pouty breathy eyelash-fluttering posings dont help (but remember Rock is directing her). She seems to represent more an idea of an available woman than an actual person. It should also be said that the movie which seems to be quite a traditional rom-com in its perky TV ads is actually quite hard-edged blunt and earnest about the things men want and the things women dont want. But its central issue is Will he or wont he? We watch with comic rapture as she becomes a larger and larger part of his life and we see the danger signs way before he does. Soon hes tending her increasing demands -- job recommendations lunch dates that drift into afternoons that sort of thing -- at considerable strain to his own career. His secretary and his best office buddy (Steve Buscemi underused) try to counsel him. He becomes Nikkis ""friend"" but the conversation between them is becoming increasingly intimate. Does race play a factor in any of this? Of course it does. For one thing as an African American Richards fragility of life seems so much more amplified. His very blackness makes him subject to higher rules of behavior as Rock makes clear in a nifty comic aside earlier A young black man enters an elevator listening to rap on his iPod while repeating the lyrics which are ugly and hostile. All the whites react with horror; Richard shrinks to nothing because he cant afford to be seen as ""that kind"" of African American. A few minutes later same elevator a white guy gets in -- iPod same spew of lyrics same hostility and aggression. This time Nobody notices. I also suspect that underneath its sex-com conventions a deeper battle is being waged Nikki represents the attractions of the thug life the liberations of no longer needing the man of claiming some sense of authenticity. But she also represents the instability of that lifestyle the irrationality the irresponsibility. Shes never on time or shes early. She has to flout the rules by smoking. She vibrates with danger. Shes like gangsta rap a kind of fever dream of freedom without cost or consequences. Meanwhile sensible Brenda is the path of the straight and true Not really authentic but secure. She wont let rap into the house she hates the N-word even when used colloquially and the Others must be coded in conversation as ""W-h-i-t-e-s"" for the childrens ears because she doesnt want the kids growing up hyper-aware of their racial identification. At the same time the movie is hilarious. A comic set piece involves Coopers attempts to pick a fight with Brenda so that he can storm out of the house and be with Nikki. He chooses as his battleground the chicken dinner he has prepared and does a brilliant riff on the meaninglessness of chicken after so much of it. Its every twisted crazed must-win-at-all-cost flame-up that everyone familiar with marriage will recognize. Then theres his encounter with Viagra which I cant describe but which has to be one of the funniest scenes in the decade and should easily push the movie over the 100 million mark by week 3. I Think I Love My Wife (94 minutes area theaters) is rated R for pervasive profanity and some sexual content.

Chris Rock; Release Date Wide 03/16/2007; Runtime (in minutes) 94; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Posted March 14 2007 -- 1200 AM EDT I Think I Love My Wife has got to be the unlikeliest French New Wave classic ever to be retrofitted by a famous African-American stand-up comedian best known for his stinging social commentary -- at least until Dave Chappelle remakes Jean-Luc Godards Breathless as a hip-hop caper. As generations have before him Chris Rock responded deeply to the pleasurable intelligence of Chloe in the Afternoon one of the six self-described ""moral tales"" made by the great French master Eric Rohmer -- a mature 1972 study of a man faithful to the wife he loves whose fidelity is challenged by the reappearance of a sexy available woman from his past. But as few auteurists might have done Rock -- director as well as co-writer and uneasy hero of his own movie -- has taken Rohmers marvelously probing psychologically refined exquisitely yakky and deeply French movie and turned it into a coarse-talking race-conscious tonally challenged life-crisis comedy. Now its about Rock as a sex-starved daddy named Richard a prosperous suited-up banker. Each weekday morning Richard kisses his beautiful wife and two adorable kids goodbye and departs his handsome suburban house for the commuter train into shining Manhattan all the while ogling sexy strangers. ""Shes like a painting"" he informs us about one ""a painting Id like to mount."" Richards lovely nurturing schoolteacher spouse Brenda (Gina Torres an elegant comedian) is perfect in every way but one--shes uninterested in sex. (""My face hurts"" is one of her sitcom excuses.) And eventually Richard who wants sex with his wife but isnt inclined to seek it elsewhere retreats into a kind of defeated fantasy life. As he puts it in a running interior monologue that has somewhat less panache than that of the conflicted hero of the original ""Im bored out of my f--in mind."" So far the guys more Everybody Loves Raymond than Masculin-Feminin. Then one day the porno-provocatively named Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington from Ray working every come-hither eyelash) former girlfriend of an old buddy sashays into Richards ultra-beige (indeed ultra-white) corporate world ostensibly seeking an employment letter of recommendation. Maybe shes auditioning for a road production of Showgirls? Nikki upsets all that beige in her skimpy devil-red baby-doll dress and Richards eyes go yowza-wowza. (In truth Rock looks kind of terrified.) You know Nikkis up to no good because she smokes constantly in forbidden places like offices and restaurants. Its not long before he and Nikki are meeting on sunny city afternoons and doing -- not what you think since Rohmers interest lies not in the Doing It but in the moral vertigo of teetering on the precipice of Doing It. But the two are certainly doing something. As Richards more battle-hardened colleague George (another perfectly pitched supporting turn by Steve Buscemi) puts it ""Shes f--in you -- you just dont know it."" (In a nice shout-out to The King of Comedy Richard toils at the firm of Pupkin amp; Langford; in an even nicer shout-out to Rocks beloved hometown the movie is shot all around NYC.) The EW convention of F-bleeping makes discussion cumbersome because so much of the script (co-written with fellow comic Louis C.K.) is filled with naked raunchy talk of f--ing and its accoutrements -- conversation perfectly tailored to Rocks stand-up world but forced and distracting in a movie with such sophisticated aspirations. Actually some of the movies best bits are sharp observational moments perfect for a one-man act on HBO especially when the star gravitates toward the subject of blackness in a white American world and even more specifically upper-middle-class blackness in an undisciplined N-word-using African-American pop-oriented culture. But those arent the bits that drive the essentially conservative movie comfortably toward its safe morally inevitable conclusion. Rock isnt yet a natural actor -- he uses the same pursed facial expressions to convey lust fear guilt and dismay at being served chicken by his wife one too many times. And in directing his second feature after the equally ragged but more relaxed political comedy Head of State he cant yet translate his skills as a brilliant comedian into equally sharp focus; his cinematic skills are only mild. Given his good taste in French art he might be better off teaming up Dave Chappelles Block Party-style with a stronger visual interpreter like Michel Gondry. I think Id love that.

The main drawback is that under director Rock actor Rock doesnt possess quite the chops to pull off this character and the humor and flights of fancy are simply too low-key for a movie that lists ""Irresistible Fantasy Woman No. 1 No. 2 and No. 3"" in its credits. Beyond Rocks most fervent loyalists box office should be modest though liaisons with DVD and other platforms could be steamier. Writing with fellow comic Louis C.K. whose stand-up act also zeroes in on the vagaries of marriage Rock has rather ambitiously chosen to take a stab at reworking the 1972 Eric Rohmer film ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" though any number of middle-aged male fantasies -- from ""10"" to ""The Woman in Red"" -- could have provided the template. Rock plays Richard Cooper a successful employee in a New York investment firm who per extensive voiceover narration is in the throes of an outwardly idyllic but sexually dormant relationship with wife Brenda (Gina Torres) the mother of his two adorable kids. Hes outwardly happily but flatly bored -- experiencing the equivalent of an eight-year itch which leaves him prone to fantasizing about women he passes on the streets or the subway. Along comes Nikki (Kerry Washington) the ex-girlfriend of one of Richards old pals who arrives seeking a favor and injects an element of excitement into his life -- though her repeated visits to his office not only set tongues wagging but also begin to negatively affect his work. Undeniably attracted to her Richard is quick to say nothings happening between them although he slowly begins to realize this amounts to the worst of both worlds -- all of the guilt with none of the adulterous fun. None of this is lost on Richards co-worker George (an underused Steve Buscemi brightening things up whenever hes onscreen) a sort of reverse ""Guide for the Married Man"" who counsels Richard that unlike many husbands hes not the type that can stray without pangs of conscience. Rock previously directed ""Head of State"" but the tone here remains mostly flat even with narration that brings to mind his rightfully lauded CW series ""Everybody Hates Chris."" By failing to maximize Richards central predicament the most intriguing elements are all peripheral such as Richard and Brendas banter about using the ""N word"" or bitching about W-H-I-T-E-S in front of the kids and other issues pertaining to the rising black middle class. Ultimately the entire movie boils down (""builds"" is giving it a bit too much credit) to whether Richard will succumb to temptation killing time until then with scenes that are alternately amusing improbable or strained -- the most absurd coming when he bribes a restaurant maitre d to have a distractingly pretty waitress stationed elsewhere. The one breakthrough involves Washington who after a variety of roles that recently included ""The Last King of Scotland"" is unleashed as a full-blown seductress and should see her cachet rise dramatically on the lad-mag circuit. Yet as written Nikkis motivations remain so vague as to keep her perhaps inevitably more a symbol than a character. The qualified title meanwhile wryly addresses the schizophrenia that plagues Richard throughout the story but culminates in a payoff that given all that precedes it rings a trifle hollow. And when Nikki teasingly tells Richard hes ""not in love youre in loyal"" shell no doubt speak for many Rock fans who seeing the comic far from his ""A"" game will do so less out of love than loyalty.
