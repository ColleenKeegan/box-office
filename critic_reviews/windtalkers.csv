The culture of the U.S. Marine Corps is quite the opposite--gung-ho machismo in full cry. Yet in World War II the latter had a desperate need for the former specifically for an unbreakable code based on the Navajo language which could be openly spoken on the radio in combat. Windtalkers is a (heavily) fictionalized account of this coupling. John Woos film concentrates on a non-com Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) a Marine ordered to guard one of the code talkers...

The hook is to show how Marines recruited Navajos to radio secret battle positions -- and that those code carriers must be killed if theyre about to be captured. Its a situation thats never played as powerfully as might be expected from helmer John Woo. ""Windtalkers"" is a powerful premise turned into a stubbornly flat derivative war movie. The contempo hook is to show how Marines recruited Navajos to radio secret battle positions via the unbreakable code of the Navajo language -- and that those code carriers must be killed by their fellow soldiers if theyre about to be captured. But its a predicament thats never played as powerfully as might be expected from director John Woo who knows his way around the world of men and guns and moral quandaries. Though delayed a year by MGM from its original release Woos first English-language venture into period setting and wartime fits the current patriotic mood but with battle carnage guaranteed to repel female viewers pic wont come close to the B.O. reach of Woos previous summer blockbusters. John Rices and Joe Bateers purely functional script fails to interject interesting dramatic detail and character into the clash of cultures as Marine grunts battling Japanese in the bloody struggle for the Pacific island of Saipan in 1944 learn to understand an elite group of Navajo-born Marines. Instead war movie cliches pile so high you expect Audie Murphy to leap over the ridge at any moment. And in what could have been one of his most fascinating subdued roles as a loyal extremely effective but traumatized Marine Nicolas Cage is held back every step of the way by the scripts numerous shortcomings. Pic intercuts between Adam Beachs Ben a Navajo recruit leaving wife and child behind on the reservation as he trains to become a ""code talker"" at Camp Pendleton and Cages Joe as he loses everyone in his platoon during a vicious close-up battle in the Solomon Islands. When Ben along with pal Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie) is assigned to code-talking duty with troops shipping out of Hawaii Joe is already on the island recuperating from eardrum damage. He cheats his way through a hearing test with aid from a nurse Rita (Frances OConnor) who has a soft spot for him and is assigned to serve as guard to the Navajo code talkers -- with orders to protect the code at all costs. Ben is Joes charge -- babysitter is Joes term -- and the script formulaically makes certain they dont get along for most of the pic. The invasion of Saipan has Joe pulling off moves that would make Sergeant York blush while Ben is frozen by fear at the bloodshed around him. Pics remaining 95 minutes depict the U.S. landing and march up the island led by Hjelmstad (Peter Stormare) whose origins judging by Stormares bizarre accent are somewhere mysteriously between Stockholm and New Orleans. Portrayal of troops taking a Pacific island the various multicultural elements and the recurring voice-over presence of OConnors Rita as she writes letters to Joe is too close to ""The Thin Red Line"" to ignore. If anything the new pics paint-by-numbers approach underlines the sheer originality of the Terrence Malick epic. ""Windtalkers"" routinely alternates between battles rest stops around the campfire and various personality clashes and bonding of the most obvious sort. As enthusiastic as Joe is morose and withdrawn Ox (Christian Slater) gets chummy with Charlie performing duets on harmonica and Navajo flute. Ignored by Joe who doesnt hide his quiet racism Ben is assaulted by obnoxious bigot Chick (Noah Emmerich). Ben gets inspired as Joe continues to kick butt and after many aggressive but visually uninspired action scenes Woo constructs a pair of set pieces more worthy of his oeuvre. The first in which Ben poses as a Japanese soldier and Joe as his captive is pics most exciting which allows Woo to revisit some of his favorite situations such as the ""impossible"" standoff. Final action climax cant match the intensity of preceding sequence in which Joe must perform a deed that almost totally embitters Ben toward him. Woo fans will be impressed by virtual p.o.v framing of hand-to-hand combat but will surely miss helmers signature ballet-like moves which had to be sacrificed for period actions credibility. Graphic carnage is unevenly realized however and grander panoramic vistas of battles are much less convincing than the fixed-bayonets action more akin to the HK gun battles on which Woo wrote the book. Cage constantly struggles toward a rich complex characterization of man fighting off contradictory impulses to fight or to quit and run but the portrait remains incomplete. Probably the fullest realized Indian screen character since the days of ""Little Big Man"" Beachs Ben goes from innocent to warrior but along a strictly simplistic Hollywood path. Slater brings more spunk to Ox than exists on paper but like other support including Emmerich Stormare and Mark Ruffalo is leashed to purely bit-part material. Physical production mostly shot on Oahu is solidly pro but never breathtaking. Composer James Horner quotes other composers -- this time Aaron Copland and Jerry Goldsmith.

Their native language was one code the Japanese couldnt crack - unless they captured a Navajo and made him talk. According to this movie the Marines allocated a bodyguard to each op with a secret injunction to protect the code at all costs. So it is that battle-hardened Joe Enders (Cage) keeps his distance from fresh-faced Ben Yahzee (Beach). Hong Kong exile (and practising Catholic) John Woo would seem well placed to appreciate the ironies here. The war in the Pacific was marked by savage xenophobia on both sides. It does not go unremarked that the Navajo could pass for the enemy - which is how some GIs treat them. Yet the Native Americans are risking their lives for a country stolen from under their feet. Insofar as this is actually a film about belief systems Woo conjures several quite moving scenes celebrating the courage and conviction which allows individuals to become comrades. But the screenwriters struggle to integrate the coded transmissions with the action and the flamboyant set piece battles feel like so much empty rhetoric. The climax is especially contrived. An absorbing effort all the same.

Hollywood has yet to release any battle films that were made after the sad awakening of September 11 but the pictures that were kicked into development by ""Saving Private Ryans"" success are establishing new boundaries for onscreen violence. ""Windtalkers"" is a textbook World War II melodrama with enough carnage to convince the ""Black Hawk Down"" crowd that its an unflinching depiction of real combat. Well maybe it is and maybe it isnt. But no amount of burning blasting stabbing and shooting can hide a weak script. This is supposed to be the story of Pvt. Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) one of the many Navajo radio operators who relayed combat instructions during World War II via a code that was based on their native language. The enemy never managed to break the code -- Japan and Germany had no Navajos -- but that didnt stop them from torturing any apparent American Indians they captured to see if theyd spit out the answers. So Yahzee is teamed up with Sgt. Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) a physically and spiritually wounded combat veteran whose mission is to protect Yahzee ... or to kill him if it looks like hes about to fall into enemy hands.

Photo Credit Stephen Vaughan W-246 NICOLAS CAGE (right) Joe Enders and ADAM BEACH as code-talker Ben Yahzee in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures epic drama WINDTALKERS. Photo Credit Stephen Vaughan Photo HANDOUT Empty Windtalkers / Cage cant overcome scripts limits in Woos bloody tale 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WINDTALKERS War drama. Starring Nicolas Cage Adam Beach and Christian Slater. Directed by John Woo. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Windtalkers"" tells a lukewarm story about some unknown heroes of World War II Navajo radio operators whose encoded transmissions based on their ancient language helped win the war in the Pacific. It features a handful of convincing battle scenes under the sure hand of director John Woo and a lead actor Nicolas Cage who does his best to wrest a full-bodied performance from an undernourished script. Cage may go down with the script but he goes down trying. He grunts sweats and bleeds. He talks slowly as if trying to impart some underlying anguish. Its a strenuous effort and the audience feels the strain. He plays Enders a Marine assigned to protect the Navajo code even if that means killing code-talkers about to fall into enemy hands. Unfortunately Enders as written is a cipher so his moral dilemma lacks emotional force or meaning. We come away from ""Windtalkers"" thinking fine but who cares? Like ""The Sum of All Fears"" and ""Bad Company"" ""Windtalkers"" was originally scheduled for a fall 2001 release then postponed because of the Sept. 11 attacks. The movie has not aged well in storage. It dates from that weird brief period about two years ago in which Americans were actually nostalgic for World War II a nostalgia born out of an illusion of safety which has since evaporated. ""Windtalkers"" had a built-in context then -- the world was interested -- but now the story has to stand on its own. At least the battles work. We first meet Enders in the midst of one a nasty one in which his entire company gets wiped out while he escapes with an ear injury. The makeup people have a good time with that ear injury. For the rest of the movie his scar gets redder or paler varying from scene to scene with no rhyme or reason. When Enders leaves the military hospital he is partnered with a Navajo code-talker named Ben (Adam Beach) and told that he has to ""protect the code"" at all costs. Because he knows he might have to kill Ben hes surly and unfriendly which means that he never reveals himself. Enders also doesnt open up to Ox (Christian Slater) a soldier who shares his assignment. And he never answers the friendly letters of a pretty nurse (Frances OConnor) who for reasons difficult to grasp takes an instant liking to him. He stays locked down. Maybe were just meeting Enders too late. At this stage of the game his only mode of communication is battle and his only creative expression is killing. Its a measure of Cages focus as well as a tribute to the intelligent battle choreography that it doesnt seem ridiculous that Enders takes the Japanese-held island of Saipan virtually single-handedly. In old war movies there were battle lines. In ""Windtalkers"" its just horrifying chaos with the enemy popping up on all sides as in a video game. This is the modern way of filming battles so theres nothing here that would particularly identify the scenes as the work of John Woo -- except perhaps for the blood. A soldier gets his leg blown off and we see the stump. Another soldier is set on fire. There should be a payoff for all this difficult viewing since ""Windtalkers"" is not trying to be a military history but a story about people. For Woo who made his name directing sleek cinematic bloodbaths in his native Hong Kong the movie is an attempt to make a film of emotional depth and richness. But despite some feints in a soulful direction the picture has none of the interior quality of a multifaceted war film like Terrence Malicks ""The Thin Red Line."" Woo is all about elegant surfaces not inner conflicts. The best the movie can manage are some sweet interludes in which Ox (Slater) and his code-talker try to collaborate musically trading phrases on the harmonica and Navajo flute and finding their way toward harmony. Its all very nice but it leaves Enders out of the picture and he is the picture -- all scowling enigmatic and empty. Advisory This film contains graphic violence.

"USATODAY.com - Windtalkers intersperses action with contemplation Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/14/2002 - Updated 0256 AM ET Windtalkers intersperses action with contemplation By Mike Clark USA TODAY A Nicolas Cage character battles mental demons again in John Woos long-delayed Windtalkers but this time out the actor is uncommonly restrained. And Woo comes through with the voluminous action scenes fans have come to expect -- minus the trademark operatic flourishes synonymous with Hong Kongs Hard-Boiled or Hollywoods Face/Off (a Woo movie where Cage wasnt restrained). Read more below Video View trailer of Windtalkers Both mild modifications in style seem in keeping with a World War II epic that is half-visceral but also half-contemplative. Windtalkers deals with a specialized communication by code in a fact-based story whose screen telling is overdue. It further operates in a rarefied though not quite unique screen genre which includes 1951s Go for Broke and 1995s The Tuskegee Airmen. Each film tells how minorities -- in this case Navajo Indians -- made an essential contribution to the war. Windtalkers (out of four) Stars Nicolas Cage Christian Slater Adam Beach Peter Stormare Noah Emmerich Frances OConnor Director John Woo Distributor MGM Rating R for graphic violence and language In a 2 1/4-hour narrative that never flinches from the specifics of U.S. Marine casualties a recently wounded and promoted Cage comes out of recuperation assigned to a unit headed for Saipan in 1944. Its key members -- so important that Sgt. Cage is ordered never to allow their capture -- are Navajo ""code-talkers"" capable of communicating in a manner the Japanese tried but never learned to decipher. Even if Cage could understand it he might have trouble hearing it. His left ear has been maimed in battle leaving him with balance problems that contribute to his apparent depression. In contrast with Cages effective underplaying co-star Adam Beachs plot-central Navajo (fictional Ben Yahzee) is all unassuming confidence personable but no pushover even when hes a target of initial prejudice. Straightforward almost to a fault the movie has several major story components conquered racism the code battle scenes (incessant) and Cages state. Windtalkers is capably made and certainly impresses by carrying its length but it doesnt expand 60 years of World War II screen literature by very much. Of all possibilities it is most haunting in its portrayal of a doomed wartime relationship between Cage and a pretty Navy nurse (Frances OConnor) whose overtures hes too funked out to reciprocate. Woos other Hollywood movies have been limited by built-in silliness from Hard Target to Mission Impossible II. But this perfectly modulated subplot has surprising emotional depth despite its brevity a promising sign in any action specialists career.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Because the Navajo language relies so much on complex subtle nuances of pronunciation these code talkers as they were called were able to translate code into their own tongue - the Navajo word for ""hummingbird"" meant fighter plane for instance and ""beaver"" meant mine sweeper - and elude the Japanese who had broken every other enciphered transmission. Beginning in 1942 some 400 Navajo men were eventually trained as code talkers and the specialists were considered so crucial to winning the war that they were guarded by fellow Marines. This particular amazing little-known sidebar story is however not so easily adapted to movie purposes - how do you dramatize the sedentary activity of donning radio headsets for a cause? The solution in Windtalkers a big old-fashioned American war pic of the ""every guy in the unit signifies a type"" variety seizes on the notion that those Marine guards were more concerned with protecting the code itself than the lives of its talkers. The movie is a history lesson that leans hard on the dramatic potential of a hypothetical Not that theres any record that such a thing happened (and not that its legal for a Marine to be ordered to kill a fellow Marine) but would or could a patriotic moral soldier take the life of one of his own comrades who has fallen into enemy hands for the greater good of the mission? ""Windtalkers"" billows and bulges with scenes of angst and soldierly bonding. As Joe Enders a battle-scarred sergeant assigned to guard Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) Nicolas Cage winces with Ambivalent Hero Fatigue. Christian Slater as easygoing Marine guard Ox Anderson milks the pauses between combat for all theyre worth by wah-wahing on a harmonica in the gloaming accompanied by the Navajo hes assigned to protect Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie) on wooden flute. In a clunky educational demonstration of the sins of bigotry belligerent squad member Chick (Noah Emmerich) sinks to ""Injun"" baiting. But since the movie is directed by John Woo the drama trains its sights on Woos favorite target duty and friendship caught in the crosshairs. What really interests the filmmaker - famed for his action sequences but fascinated as seen in such Chow Yun-Fat-powered Hong Kong classics as ""The Killer"" (1989) and ""Hard-Boiled"" (1992) by the spiritual dimensions of the standoff - is how a pair of Navajo Marines relate to the non-Navajo soldiers assigned to protect them. What turns him on is how those relationships between men shift strain deepen and are reconfigured by chance and choice. And though this makes for an unsteadily stacked story - we barely learn how the code talkers did what they did and Navajo off-duty life as depicted is a never-ending pageant of sacred ritual solemnized by wood smoke and sunsets - it also makes for a fascinating Woo movie. ""Windtalkers"" is a fresh contribution to the cinematic literature of American WWII movies from a Chinese-born director with a flair for the imagery of spiritual battle. Real battle too. Woo re-creates the 1944 Battle of Saipan as a sweep and jumble of madly busy vista - men running shooting dying spurting blood - and intimate detail. And he embeds his action with the various signature images Woo-ists look forward to Wings flap overhead (not doves this time but avian none the less). Enders pauses in a ruined Japanese hut to tend to a sick child. He draws a picture of a Christian church in the flour dusting a kitchen table. Then its back to battle. The script by John Rice and Joe Batteer teeters between the blunt (""What a magical pile of Navajo horses--"" Chick sneers at Whitehorse) the didactic (""Its my war too Sergeant"" Yahzee informs Enders) and the what-the-hell (Fifty years from now we may be ""sittin down with the Nipponese drinkin saki"" that same chatty Chick marvels miraculously gone psychic). But Woo restrains his cast going for underplayed performances that step nimbly over the worst script landmines - and stay out of the way of ""Windtalkers"" bigger wordless ambitions. Cage and Slater who have each worked with the director before (on ""Face/Off"" and ""Broken Arrow"" respectively) display a respectful modulation that keeps the focus on the ensemble while Beach (""Smoke Signals"") and especially the Navajo newcomer Willie are never overwhelmed by the patriotic mantle theyre assigned to carry. ""Windtalkers"" blows this way and that but theres no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass true to himself. Besides which he leaves a visual calling card In one tense confrontation Chick and Yahzee face each other with guns drawn and pointed at the other mans face. The gesture is code for ""John Woo was here."" Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.
