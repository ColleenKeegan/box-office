Keir Gilchrist (left) and Zach Galifianakis (right) star Kind Of A Funny Story (K.C.Bailey/Focus Features) Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald10/7/2010 Editor rating 2.5 Craig the anxiety-ridden teen protagonist of Its Kind of a Funny Story seems to have a pretty decent life. Hes got brains well-off if somewhat clueless parents admission to a prestigious New York public high school and grand ambitions that stand a chance of being realized (maybe not the daydream about being president but certainly the hopeful wishes for some eventual unspecified success). But Craig (Keir Gilchrist of United States of Tara) cant stop thinking about killing himself. Hes depressed in love with his best friends girl sick from the pressure of his fathers plans for him and he has randomly quit taking his Zoloft. So early one Sunday morning he checks himself into a psychiatric ward. Its Kind of a Funny Story follows Craigs five days - the minimum requirement for a designated potential suicide ... in the hospital during which he gets scared meets a kind psychiatrist (Viola Davis) and makes friends with other troubled patients including Bobby (Zach Galifianakis of The Hangover). Craig also falls for a pretty girl who happens to be in his coed ward and admits that his life isnt so bad - just in time. The film was directed and written by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck the team behind the Half Nelson about the complicated friendship between a junkie teacher and his middle-school student. Its Kind of a Funny Story is far lighter in tone more formulaic and easily forgettable. Unlike Half Nelson a poignant piercing in-depth character study its more comedy than a realistic portrait of depression so theres never any doubt that things will work out just fine for Craig. The movie is amusing at times with the sort of gentle humor that inspires you to smile to yourself rather than guffaw. The filmmakers rely on an array of emo tricks (ironic narration funky architectural drawings of a city that come to life an impromptu musical performance of Under Pressure sung by the patients in full glitterwear) for laughs and the results are more or less positive. This is a film about depression though and it comes awfully close to trivializing its subject by suggesting that all Craig needed really was a cute girl to like him back. But the cast is effective enough at reflecting mild irreverence throughout and the scripts low-key humor keeps the story from becoming unbearably maudlin. Its Kind of a Funny Story lacks substance but after youve spent a short time in this ward you have to agree with Craig These crazies arent so bad.

Adapted from a novel by Ned Vizinni Its Kind of a Funny Story marks the first time the pair have not worked from their own material and the lack of an authentic connection to the characters and story is palpable.Set over a single week in a surprisingly charming clean and hospitable New York psychiatric ward the film monitors the mildly volatile mental health of preppy weed Craig Gilner (Keir Gilchrist) as he trades indie-lyric platitudes with shouty nutbag Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) and nervously woos self-harmer Noelle (Emma Roberts). Its a light comedy of teen dysfunction that soft-peddles complex insight in favour of breezy sentiment simple plotting and musical interludes. There are a few traces of old Boden/Fleck to saviour such as the dreamy Broken Social Scene soundtrack and the pleasingly laid-back performances from the cast. But this feels like a more anonymous work one for which the pair have opted to test out the neat new toys their inflated budget has afforded them at the expense of developing a visual style that feels fitting to this story and its concerns. The only real surprise is the casting of gangly oddball Jeremy Davies as one of the ward overseers and not one of the loonies. A pleasant movie but no more.

The reviewer calls it anonymous and it absolutely is. Its stuffed with cliche. The most disappointing thing about it - and there isnt much thats any good; cant really think of a thing - is its horrible short-windedness. Family and friends visit the in-patient just long enough to have 4 to 6 sentence exchanges of dialogue and then leave so that the film can move to its next unrewarding scene. All conversation is merely functional. None of the characters are believable or rounded. I went to see this because it was by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck but its just a common-denominator comedy-by-numbers. A lame film from people I thought were skillful. A real pity.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 6 2011IainFeaturedI saw this at the LFF last year and whilst I can see where this reviewer has come from I took a more positive look on the film. Yes theres nothing new here you can predict whats going to happen and watching anyone acting as mentally unstable can be a bit cringe worthy particularly in comedies. All that said though I really enjoyed it Theres one particular music scene (sound track is great too) that had me grinning ear to ear and I left the cinema with a big smile on my face. Basically if you like indie-esque comedies then you should like this and it isnt as smug as the majority of this genre.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89081/its-kind-of-a-funny-story.html,200,it'skindofafunnystory1,it'skindofafunnystory,timeout

Bailey (c) 2010 Focus Features Review Its Kind of a Funny Story has charm 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Its Kind of a Funny Story Comedy-drama. Starring Keir Gilchrist Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A depressed teenager checks himself into a mental ward sees how crazy everybody else is - ""My beds on fire"" - and feels suddenly cured. But he finds out that no sorry he cannot leave. He must stay for a legally mandated five days. When he is told this he is understandably crestfallen and so are we in the audience. We know If hes not getting out were not either and at first the prospect of a long stretch doesnt seem promising. How on earth will he fill the time? How will the filmmakers? How will the audience? And then gradually what seems awful becomes human what seems foreign becomes familiar and about halfway into this sincere and surprisingly lovable movie a vacation feeling sets in. He doesnt want to leave and neither do we. Based on the novel by Ned Vizzini and written and directed by the team that created ""Half Nelson"" Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" ambles along and has a feeling of randomness about it but in fact its tightly plotted. Every moment however seemingly haphazard and casually presented is keyed to the progress of a young man from lost to not so lost. The possible pitfalls are many. First of all they have to make us believe it Pep talks dont cure depression and neither do fleeting moments of exhilaration or even insight. So the incidents presented have to be both authentic in a quotidian sort of way and yet slyly and convincingly transformative. ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" isnt flashy but it gets there. The journey is aided immeasurably by the casting of Keir Gilchrist as young Craig. He has dark sensitive eyes and a probity about him that wins you to his side and makes you believe that this is one valuable kid. Gilchrist though in no way self-indulgent or self-consciously theatrical just has one of those faces that shows every calibration of thought and emotion. He can use this quality dramatically or comedically as the occasion demands. This is a seriously talented young actor. The presence of Zach Galifianakis in the cast might lead people to assume that the movie is funnier than it is. But ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" is more of a drama with some laughs than a comedy with funny parts and Galifianakis role as a husband and father who has fought suicidal depression his whole life is a sober one. Bobby (Galifianakis) takes the newbie under his wing and in a droll but straight-faced way shows him around. The movie taps into a curious truth about life and a particular variety of relationship that exists in the world but thats rarely if ever depicted in movies Theres a special mentoring bond that can sometimes develop between a thoroughly screwed-up adult and a slightly less screwed-up teenager. No matter how screwed up the adult is he knows more than the kid. And the kid so used to being lectured by functioning members of the older generation feels less intimidated and more able to learn from this kind of older person. A beautiful thing in this film which is fairly lovely throughout is the way Galifianakis looks at Gilchrist. On the surface he looks impassive but theres a lot behind that gaze Knowing amusement a certain impatience and most of all a longing to be back at that stage of life again before the mistakes were made and with every possibility still available. Not everything in ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" cuts that deep but neither does it cut corners and Craigs blossoming friendship with a teenage girl (Emma Roberts) is especially well played and genuine. -- Advisory Drug talk sexual situations and mature themes.

By Peter Rainer Film Critic October 8 2010 Save for later Saved Zach Galifianakis (l.) and Keir Gilchrist are shown in a scene from the movie Its Kind of a Funny Story. K.C. Bailey/Focus Features/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Movies about psychiatric ward patients are usually equal parts exploitative and inspirational. From ""The Snake Pit"" to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" to ""Girl Interrupted"" we are encouraged to see the patients as outcasts from a society too sane - too emotionally straitjacketed - to accommodate them.""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" based on the semiautobiographical novel by Ned Vizzini is the latest variant on this sentimentalism. Craig Gilner (Keir Gilchrist) is a bright severely stressed-out 16-year-old Brooklyn boy who checks himself into a mental health clinic. Because the youth ward is temporarily closed he finds himself in the adult ward where one of the patients the spacey sarcastic Bobby (a very good Zach Galifianakis) becomes his mentor and confidante without ever entirely fessing up about his own life.Craigs overbearing parents (played by Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan) are highlighted as the prime reason for his predicament. This is standard in a genre in which parents are routinely made out to be the bad guys. Craig also finds himself attracted to the shy frail Noelle (Emma Roberts) and for a while it looks as if were going to be subjected to a new-style version of ""David and Lisa."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden the films co-writing-directing team are too principled to tip the film into the slacker reaches of sorrow. Even though the various patients too often come across as cutesy case studies Fleck and Boden for the most part avoid working their lives up into some grand-scale ""Cuckoos Nest""-style microcosm of humanity.

"Its Kind of a Funny Story | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; it-s-kind-of-a-funny-story ) Its Kind of a Funny Story (United States 2010) October 10 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its rare that a story set within the confines of a mental ward/hospital/asylum cannot be said to owe a debt to Milos Formans One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest. Its Kind of a Funny Story is a case in point. Even though the basic narrative bears little resemblance to the central story of the classic 1975 drama one central aspect is much in evidence the sense of camaraderie (almost family) that develops among the inhabitants of the place. Whether there with the goal of eventually returning to society or shut away because that will never be a possibility they bond and draw strength from one another. Whether this is an accurate depiction of how things are in real life I cannot say but its almost always how they are in the movies. As the tale begins the 16-year old lead character Craig (Keir Gilchrist) informs the audience via voiceover narration that he has been having vivid dreams of killing himself. Frightened that he might act upon these while waking he checks himself into a mental institution. Almost immediately he feels that he has made a mistake but the only way out is to endure the mandatory five-day (minimum) observation period. His parents (Lauren Graham Jim Gaffigan) are supportive but a little mystified as to what landed their son in his current predicament although its plain to us that the high-pressure academic demands of his father have something to do with it. Instead of holing up in his room Craig does a little socializing forming a friendship with the gregarious Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) who is open about everything except the reason hes in the hospital. He also begins a tentative romance with Noelle (Emma Roberts) who might be enchanting enough to make him give up his obsession with Nia (Zoe Kravitz) the girlfriend of his best friend Aaron (Thomas Mann). The movie co-written and co-directed by the team of Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden (from the novel by Ned Vizzini) balances the right amounts of seriousness light comedy and whimsy. Some of the dream and fantasy sequences are characterized by an ethereal quality (such as an immersion into the animated world of Craigs imaginary city which is eerily like the one in Inception) or an overt campiness (a lip-synching to the Queen/David Bowie song ""Under Pressure""). As far as mental ward tales go this one is a soft-sell without a lot of the hard drama that typifies ""breakthroughs"" and without the horror elements that often creep in around the edges. No one is force-fed their drugs or subjected to inhumane practices and the psychiatrist (Viola Davis) is empathetic and kind-hearted. The point of the movie is that Craig comes to appreciate what he has. He makes the conscious decision to let go of the self-imposed pressure that led to his ""cry for help"" (its doubtful that suicide was ever a real option) and allow himself to embrace the inner artist he has hidden away from his family and friends. Finding a kindred spirit in Noelle is a source of immense help and comfort and she is clearly better for him than Nia whose interest in Craig becomes apparent only once his hospitalization imbues him with an off-kilter celebrity status at their school. The strongest relationship is the one between Craig and Bobby. As the former learns more about the life of the latter he discovers what it really means to have problems. The acting is strong with Galifianakis doing an especially good job as the likeable Bobby. The element of reticence in the performance is perfectly in keeping with what one would expect from a man whos hiding a few things. And although Bobby generally comes across as a nice easy-going guy there are times when cracks in his personality provide a glimpse of something darker - those are the instances in which Galifianakis shines. (Its a shame that Its Kind of a Funny Story may be too small for the actor to receive some kind of recognition at Oscar nomination time). Lead performer Keir Gilchrist is a relatively fresh face although he bears a resemblance to a younger Justin Long. Hes believable in the role and displays chemistry with Galifianakis and his same-age female co-stars Emma Roberts and Zoe Kravitz both of whom are equally good. Its Kind of a Funny Story is aptly named because theres enough comedy to leaven an otherwise serious tale and allow the viewer to depart the theater in an upbeat mood. Its probably a tough job to pack a theater for a movie that takes place within the confines of a mental hospital - that kind of setting does not sell tickets - but the production is more uplifting life-affirming and enjoyable than one would suspect. Yes clichA(c)s abound but they are more than counterbalanced by the strength of the characters and the voice of the lead. Theres a lot to like about this little film.

They require stories that relate to the pressures of success the romantic obsessions that drive or threaten to derail them and the fugitive hopes they might harbor of becoming a different person than the one their parents expect. ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" based on the first-person novel by Ned Vizzini follows bright depressed Craig Gilner (Keir Gilchrist) as he checks into the psych ward of a Manhattan hospital. Hes having suicidal thoughts. But as he hands his shoe laces over to an orderly hes having second thoughts. Yes hes blue. Hes has a crush on his best friends girl (Zoe Kravitz). Hes blocked about writing an essay for a prestigious summer school gig. Yes hes part of the Zoloft nation. But does he really belong on Three North among a population of wounded idiosyncratic characters? How to explore mental illness -- particularly depression -- without cheating on the pain people face and keeping the wry energy of the book? Its a balancing act that filmmakers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck dont quite pull off. For instance Craig has an immediate hankering for Noelle (Emma Roberts). The lovely teen bears the faint scars of a cutter but we never quite connect with whatever leads her to slash and bleed. This is a strange failing for the tag team who has handled the wounded so well in previous outings. The duo have an impressive track record with ache and ecstasy. They wrote and directed ""Half Nelson"" (about a drug-imbibing teacher and his high school student) and ""Sugar"" (a wise wonderful work about a Dominican baseball pitcher who gets a shot at the majors.) Part of the problem is Gilchrist who looks like a young Justin Long and an even younger Keanu Reeves. He is not entirely expressive and while this may capture the shuttered aspect of depression it doesnt help make him an entirely compelling protagonist. Zach Galifianakis brings his frumpy brand of nimble performance to Bobby the floors leader of a sort. The heavily bearded actor can be found everywhere these days. There he is in previews of the upcoming comedy ""Due Date"" opposite Robert Downey Jr. There he is on the small screen in the second season of the HBO series ""Bored to Death."" Viola Davis does an able job as Dr. Minerva the hospitals shrewdly sensitive shrink. This is not ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" with its angry interrogation of authority. There are a number of incandescent moments here. An art therapy class illustration turns into a beautifully rendered animated sequence of a densely beguiling cityscape. Lines of the classic tune ""Under Pressure"" take on teary heft performed by people seen but so often avoided. And a scene involving Craigs shut-down roommate Muqtada is full of grace. ""ITS KIND OF A FUNNY STORY."" PG-13 Drama. 1 hour 41 minutes. Directed and written by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck; from the book by Ned Vizzini; photography by Andrij Parekh; starring Keir Gilchrist Zach Galifianakis Emma Stone Zoe Kravitz Viola Davis Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 08 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English First reaction to Anna Boden and Ryan Flecks new teen psychiatric movie is that it might be called Its Kind of a Thin Movie. The film follows 16-year-old Craig Gilner (Keir Gilchrist) a bright stressed student who enters a Brooklyn psychiatric hospital for five days bonds with an older patient (Zach Galifianakis) and starts a romance with a girl (Emma Roberts) and realizes his problems arent so bad. Talk about the long road to recovery. Video Galifianakis on Funny Story At least the filmmakers cant be accused of resting on their laurels. The pairs previous smart hard-nosed dramas were Half Nelson which starred Ryan Gosling in an Oscar-nominated performance as a drug-addicted junior-high teacher and Sugar about a Dominican baseball prospect who gets lost in the American minor-league system. Neither made much money but the two films set the filmmakers up for something larger with a bigger budget and expectations for higher ambitions than are shown here. Unexpectedly Boden and Fleck have exchanged tough social realism for chatty first-person ruminations and imaginative flights of fancy that feel like The Catcher in the Rye reimagined by John Hughes. The film begins on the morning that Craig - in love with his best friends girlfriend fretting about getting into an elite summer school for future executives and having tossed out his meds - is struggling with fantasies of throwing himself off the Brooklyn Bridge. Instead he sensibly checks himself into a Brooklyn hospital emergency department. Hes subsequently surprised to discover hes in for a minimum five-day stay and because the youth ward is temporarily closed he has to stay with the adults. Scary? Not for a moment. The fellow patients are portrayed as more colourful ethnic pageantry than psychological distress. One African-American man (Lou Myers) walks about the clinic shouting prophetically ""Itll come to you."" An acid-casualty Hassidic Jew Solomon (Daniel London) complains of loud noise and Craigs roommate an Egyptian man (Bernard White) sleeps all day. The psych ward turns out to be an opportunity for bonding and self-affirmations Craig discovers he can sing and draw. The constant use of voiceover freeze frames and a too-cute fantasy sequence in which the entire ward performs the David Bowie-Queen collaboration Under Pressure just feels way too eager to please. While the other characters on the ward provide the kooky backdrop Craig soon bonds with the two relatively adjusted folks the older Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) and Noelle (Emma Roberts) a pretty girl his own age. The charismatic rumpled Bobby (a tame version of Jack Nicholsons Randall Murphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest) is unemployed and estranged from his family but he soon becomes Craigs guide and partner in harmless acts of rebellion including dressing up as a doctor to leave the ward from time to time. Galifianakiss performance is toned down from his usual comic bluster but he steals the movie by default. The nominal protagonist Gilchrist ( The United States of Tara) barely registers. Emma Robertss character Noelle has lots of presence but no context. Shes a pretty girl with a bad habit of cutting herself but otherwise seems precociously mature. Rounding out the cast is Viola Davis as the wards shrink Dr. Eden Minerva dolling out saintly wisdom that helps Craig discover his inner artist. The movie skitters across the surface of its potentially tragic subject dishing out moments of whimsy and poignancy like a short course of intelligence-numbing anti-depressants Though it may make you feel temporarily better its probably not worth the icky aftertaste.

He tells the admitting doctors he is suicidal but really hes more pre-suicidal casting around for a dramatic way out of his rather un-dramatic teenaged problems (getting into a top college having a girlfriend). Once inside he realizes he doesnt want to be there at all -- ""I thought you guys could do something quick"" he says wistfully eying the exits -- but hes obligated to stay five days. Let the healing begin. (See TIMEs Fall Entertainment Guide.)The movie is an adaptation of Ned Vizzinis young adult novel and shares with it the central gag that Craig is stuck with the adult crazies since the childrens psych ward is being remodeled. This contrivance means that Craig gets to befriend messed-up grown ups like Bobby (Zack Galiflanakis in a mellower take on One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nests Randle McMurphy) and share a room with a muttering Egyptian man named Muqtada (Bernard White) while at the same time falling for the teenaged cutter Noelle (Emma Roberts) down the hall. For Craig who lives under the constant pressure of paternal expectations (The normally laid-back Jim Gaffigan plays his dad as a never-ending source of stress) being on psychiatric lock-down is like Match.com with life lessons. (See the all-TIME 100 best movies.)In its notion that life in a mental ward can be really neat -- even Craigs mom (Lauren Graham) comments not completely ironically that it seems like a nice place -- the movie teeters perilously close to both the gooey and offensive. Despite the pleasant loopy energy and fine performances -- Galiflanakis conjures a surprisingly sad character and I grew fond of Gilchrist with his impenetrable black eyes and rosebud mouth -- you walk out of it shaking your head. Shouldnt the impulse to make a cute movie set in an insane asylum be grounds to have ones head examined? It seems especially weird and surprising that co-writers and directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck should have chosen a project like this for their third feature film after displaying such sure-footedness in their critically lauded Half Nelson and Sugar.But its worth considering precisely whom the movie is meant for. Its not labeled as such but Its Kind of a Funny Story is squarely aimed at young adults. Its a teen romance with a public service message like cinemas cooler answer to the ABC Afterschool Special. (The generations that grew up on those lessons in the 70s 80s and early 90s mocked them mercilessly but have we been able to forget them?) Teen suicide is a lamentable problem that doesnt seem to be going away. Witness Rutgers student Tyler Clementis tragic plunge off the George Washington bridge on Sept. 22 Massachusetts teen Phoebe Prince hanging herself in January and the remarkable spate of deaths in Palo Alto Calif. last year in which five high school students committed suicide on the tracks of the local commuter rail in the course of just seven months. Palo Alto is arguably one of the nations most intense breeding grounds for youthful success and its issuant pressures and as Craig tells us in goofy little flashbacks thats the kind of community he lives in too. (The Bullying of Seth Walsh Requiem for a Small-Town Boy.)So while it may seem trivializing to have a boys suicidal urges take the kind of fortunate twists that in the space of a few days land him kisses from two pretty girls and the rediscovery of a forgotten talent the impulse that lands young Craig in the hospital is not something to be scoffed at. His problems in comparison to the ones the adult inmates have are far easier to surmount. Craig (and his parents) need an attitude adjustment more than anything else. Like all teens particularly troubled ones he needs someone empathetic to listen and offer help. Craig is not being bullied at school or having his intimate encounters broadcast on the Internet; his woes are sort of ""depression lite"" compared to these cases with national profiles. Given the Clementi case youd have understood if the distributors had panicked and pulled Its Kind of a Funny Story from its release date out of fear it might be considered seen as trivializing teen suicide. Thats a tough call; Id say the message that gaining outside perspective on ones problems can make a huge difference to a teenager isnt a bad one to send out into the world at this point. (Read how to bully-proof young girls.)Morever the movie makes a valuable point about teens and depression Craigs popularity skyrockets amongst his friends when word gets out that hes in a mental ward. Teens love drama; even the girl he adores from afar Nia (Zoe Kravitz) is suddenly interested in him. The realization of this irony -- that popularity is based on bizarre and unreasonable factors and should therefore should not be taken seriously -- is a reiteration of something our knowing pop culture has been playing with for years. (Think of 1989s Heathers where a mean girls popularity grew by leaps and bounds after her supposed suicide.) But this fact might not necessarily be obvious to teens. And for them Its Kind of a Funny Story is not likely to seem tasteless or trivial. It may even speak to them.

Craig Gilner is bicycling up to the entrance of a mental health clinic. This bright 16-year-old is stressed out from the demands of being a teenager. Before his parents and younger sister are even awake Craig checks himself into Argenon Hospital. But the youth ward is temporarily closed -- so he finds himself stuck in the adult ward. One of the patients Bobby soon becomes both Craigs mentor and protege. Craig is also quickly drawn to another 16-year-old displaced to the adult ward the sensitive Noelle who just might make him forget his longtime unrequited crush Nia. During his five days stay Craig learns more about life love and the pressures of growing up. Starring Keir Gilchrist Zach Galifianakis Emma Roberts Viola Davis Zoe Kravitz Aasif Mandvi Lauren Graham Jim Gaffigan Daniel London Adrian Martinez Director Anna Boden Ryan Fleck Running time 141 Release Opened Oct 8 2010  Editorial Review Not much to get psyched aboutBy Ann HornadayFriday October 8 2010Theres very little thats even kind of funny in ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" which cant accurately be described as a comedy but isnt a true drama either. Keir Gilchrist stars as a Brooklyn high school student named Craig who pronouncing himself overwhelmed by ""grades girls two wars impending environmental catastrophe and an imploding economy"" commits himself to psychiatric care at a hospital. The youth ward is full so Craig spends five days in the adult ward where he learns lessons about life and growing up from its motley clientele. If youre thinking ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest of a Boy Interrupted"" youre keying into one of the major problems with ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" which is that so many elements from its setup to scenes of therapy sessions and hallway high jinks seem as canned as the blandest dayroom Muzak. Gilchrist delivers an unobjectionable but undistinguished performance as a teenager whose journey ultimately feels frivolously low-stakes. And Emma Roberts has been woefully miscast as a patient named Noelle who as a character reminiscent of Angelina Jolies volatile troubled child in ""Girl Interrupted"" needs more ballast than Robertss decidedly non-edgy persona. (The cuddly whack-jobs who populate the rest of the ward are played in throwaway performances by such otherwise terrific actors as Jeremy Davies Daniel London and the redoubtable Viola Davis here completely wasted as Craigs therapist.) The most memorable performance in ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" belongs to Zach Galifianakis most recently seen in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" and ""The Hangover."" Galifianakis has the kind of portly deadpan presentation that made him amusing doing next to nothing in those movies. Hes amusing here too but he also manages to bring emotional gravitas to a character who unlike Craig stands to lose everything when his hitch at the hospital is up. Adapted from the Ned Vizzini novel by co-directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" counts as a surprising misfire from the team that brought audiences such assured intimate films as ""Half Nelson"" and ""Sugar."" Whereas those early efforts exuded ease and naturalism the freeze frames and lip-syncing musical number in ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" feel forced and inauthentic. Lets hope the teams flirtation with too-hip-for-its-own-good filmmaking is as brief as Craigs own mental health break.Contains mature thematic issues sexual content drug material and profanity.

ABOUT THE MOVIEIts Kind of a Funny Story    (out of four) Stars Keir Gilchrist Zach Galifianakis Emma Roberts Viola DavisDirectors Anna Boden and Ryan FleckDistributor Focus FeaturesRating PG-13 for mature thematic issues sexual content drug material and languageRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Mental illness is not inherently funny. But people acting crazy can be. TRAILER Is it Funny to you? Its Kind of a Funny Story is notable for the easy chemistry of its ensemble cast. And the title based on Ned Vizzinis 2006 novel of the same name sums it up deftly. There is both poignancy and humor -- sometimes at the same time -- in this tale of an emotionally stressed teen who checks himself into a mental hospital. Sixteen-year-old Craig (Keir Gilchrist) feels as if he might crack under the pressure of being an overextended and sensitive college-bound high school student. Fearing that hes suicidal Craig checks in without telling his parents (Jim Gaffigan and Lauren Graham). As it happens the youth ward is temporarily closed and he must take up residence in the adult psych ward. The first person he meets is Bobby perfectly played by Zach Galifianakis in his most complex role to date. We know the actor can play weird from his goofy turn in The Hangover. But the subtler sadder aspects of his performance are a happy surprise. His comic timing is razor-sharp but his serious moments with Craig whom he takes under his wing are even more impressive. Craig finds himself drawn to Noelle (Emma Roberts) a funny but troubled teenage girl he meets on the ward. Once checked in hes compelled to stay for five days making progress in sessions with staff psychiatrist Dr. Minerva (Viola Davis). Craig meets a diverse group of adults during his stint people he would never come across in his ordinary life. At times the film recalls One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Little Miss Sunshine with its blend of angst broad comedy and singular characters. An unexpectedly amusing musical/dance sequence to the tune of David Bowie and Queens Under Pressure feels a bit like glitter rock meets Bollywood -- adding a rousing flourish to a gently comic story. Writer/directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have made a substantive departure from their previous superb -- but little-seen -- films 2006s Half Nelson and 2009s Sugar. Their offbeat sensibility serves them well for this good-hearted and more mainstream tale except when things get predictably silly as the inmates briefly run the asylum. Gilchrist 18 is a gifted expressive actor. Theres an inherent honesty in his angst-ridden and self-deprecating performance. Psychological problems tend to be portrayed as adult issues or those plaguing seriously disturbed or abused young people as in Girl Interrupted. Craig however is not that guy. He gets good grades and has friends and parents who love him. A victim of the pressures young people face navigating the murky waters of contemporary life hes not crazy just a little unwell. And though his problems are solved a bit too tidily by finding a girlfriend and having a pizza party we get the sense that Craig learns something about embracing life that will serve him in adulthood. Its hard to set a movie in a psych ward and not come off depressing condescending or foolishly zany. Its Kind of a Funny Story is a humanistic comedy that walks a tightrope of emotions and moods and manages to stay balanced.

Weinstein Company By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 8 2010 1201 a.m. ET In ""Nowhere Boy"" a modest and enjoyable account of the young John Lennon (who would have been 70 this week) the camera glances fleetingly at a small ""Strawberry Field"" sign in front of a Liverpool house. What would we have thought of Sam Taylor-Woods debut feature if the fruit of the sign had been blueberry or if the heros touchingly young band mate had been a kid named Peter instead of Paul? We might still have found her film to be modest and enjoyable albeit less resonant a coming-of-age drama about a gifted youngster caught in a no-boys land between a stern aunt who raises him and a loving mom whos too tormented to mother him. ""Nowhere Boy"" a movie that chronicles John Lennons life. More Yoko Ono on Nowhere Boy Aaron Johnson on Playing John Lennon in Nowhere Boy John is played by Aaron Johnson who makes him a strong presence and a credible one. You can imagine that Lennons prodigious outpouring of pop poetry--the movie ends before the Quarrymen became the Beatles--was beginning to form in the fertile mind of this likable 15-year-old with a cocky facade and a tender soul. The creative process is almost audible in a silent moment when John turns an adoring gaze on the curvaceous body of his first guitar. (The reliably fine shooter Seamus McGarvey did the cinematography.) The script adapted by Matt Greenhalgh from a memoir by Lennons half-sister Julia Baird is flagrantly Oedipal; almost every scene between John and his mother is sexually charged. The curse is taken off most of these encounters by Anne-Marie Duffs eloquent work in the mothers role--beautiful as a seductress in spite of herself affecting as a woman with a wild childs impulses. And ""Nowhere Boy"" which was directed by a woman gives another enviable role to the brilliant Kristin Scott Thomas. Her Aunt Mimi isnt beautiful at least on the outside she buries her features beneath thick powder marches around in dowdy clothes and looks old beyond her years. When the time comes for truths to be told though Ms. Scott Thomas fires off volleys of passion that transform Mimi from a prim martinet into a powerfully loving influence in Johns life. ENLARGE Above right Ms. Scott Thomas and Sergi Lopez in Leaving. IFC Films Leaving Kristin Scott Thomas is the best though not the only reason to see ""Leaving."" Catherine Orsinis French-language drama starts with a departure that isnt what it seems to be. The actress looks exceedingly beautiful as Suzanne a doctors wife and devoted mother who once had her own career as a physical therapist. After 15 years of domesticity she hopes to revive her practice as soon as a builder finishes work on her home office. But shes taken out of her comfortable bourgeois life by the builder instead of the office (his name is Ivan and hes played by the excellent Spanish actor Sergi Lopez.) ""It hit me"" Suzanne tells her husband in an effort to explain her uncontrollable passion ""I didnt ask for it."" Nor did she ask for the trials that ensue. For a triangular tale with a familiar premise this compact feature which was written by the director with Gaelle Mace proves to be uncommonly interesting. (And beautifully photographed by Agnes Godard with long shots that tell more than most movies close-ups.) Suzannes folie damour slowly changes to a folly of another sort while her love for the hard-working Ivan comes up against chilling issues of class. Along the way Ms. Scott Thomas finds or creates lovely moments like the one when Suzanne tells Ivan teasingly that she wont leave his bed unless he tells her to then realizes to her quiet astonishment that she truly doesnt want to go. Life as We Know It Opposite singles who have a strong mutual dislike for each other are unexpectedly thrust together when their best friends die and the couple leaves their daughter 1 in their friends guardianship. In the wonderful world of tell-all trailers you dont have to see ""Life as We Know It"" to know what its about or how the story is worked out. As the website reveals--nay proclaims--Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel have a first date from hell followed by the discovery that the friends who introduced them have died and left a will designating them as the ones to raise their baby daughter. If that sounds ever so slightly contrived you might be a candidate for the online excerpts. Turning on your computer costs a lot less than two tickets to a multiplex and you dont have to worry about gum on the floor. If you insist on investigating the big-screen version be forewarned that the charming co-stars--shes a gifted comedienne and hes skillful too--contend against coarse direction as well as the clanking machinery of the plot. The movie will surely find an audience since it speaks to young peoples anxieties about marriage and parenting. But what are two particularly engaging performers doing in a dump of a comedy like this? ENLARGE Diane Lane and John Malkovich in Secretariat. Disney Enterprises Secretariat More Why Malkovich Is Fun to Watch A family film about one of the fastest racehorses in history ""Secretariat"" stumbles along beneath the weight of leaden life lessons. Theyre dispensed at frequent intervals by Diane Lane who does better than anyone had a right to expect since she is saddled with dialogue of exceptional dreadfulness. Ms. Lane plays Penny Chenery the owner of the Triple Crown winner a Colorado housewife and mother who in the 1970s took over a Virginia stable from her ailing father. (John Malkovich dispenses some of his trademarked acting tricks as Lucien Laurin the horses French-Canadian trainer.) The lessons are feminist in a narrow sense though theyre meant to be broadly inspirational--never give up run your race to see how far you can run etc. etc. As if the script werent clumsy enough the movie even mangles a wordless moment when Penny seeks to inspire her hay burner by looking him in the eye. His eyes are dead while her barely suppressed desperation makes her look like a horse wheedler. Tamara Drewe A young newspaper writer returns to her hometown in the English countryside where her childhood home is being prepped for sale. ""Tamara Drewe"" makes a strong case for rhinoplasty and a stronger one for the pleasures of comedy. This bucolic frolic was directed with unflagging elan by Stephen Frears from a script with a layered lineage Moira Buffini adapted a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds which was in its turn a contemporary riff on Thomas Hardys ""Far From the Madding Crowd."" The heroine of the title returns to the Wessex village of her birth with a cute new nose and newfound confidence to go with it. Once an ugly duckling known to the locals as Beaky she is now absurdly glamorous and given the unchained nature of her id extremely dangerous. (Its hard to visualize an outsize schnoz on Gemma Arterton the lovely actress who plays her but flashbacks to Tamaras childhood help.) The storys literary underpinnings are hilariously represented by the denizens of a seedy writers retreat situated near Tamaras old house which she has come back to reclaim after her mothers death. Some denizens are dazzled by her charms others are undone by them. I found myself rooting for Tamara to reconnect in the deepest way with handsome Andy her childhood friend--Luke Evans makes him a son of the soil who would have had Hardys vote--and I was shocked by her home-wrecking exploits with a fatuous scrivener though her heedlessness is exactly the point. The scintillating cast includes Roger Allam Bill Camp and Tamsin Greig. Dominic Cooper is a fatuous rock star and Jessica Barden is a wondrously funny teenager and slatternly deus ex machina who adores him. A dog named Boss--the credits say hes played by Albert Clark so make of that what you will--has the dubious distinction of turning a placid herd of Belted Galloway cows into killers. Inside Job If Charles Fergusons polemic documentary were merely depressing it could take its place alongside the dreariest of downer dramas from Bulgaria or the former East Germany. But ""Inside Job"" has the added value as well as the cold comfort of being furiously interesting and hugely infuriating. Its a scathing examination of the global economic meltdown that began more than two years ago and continues to affect our lives. Takes a closer look at what brought about the financial meltdown in the movie ""Inside Job."" Extremely cold comfort can be taken from the case that serves as an introduction. ""There is nobody unaffected in Iceland"" we are told. Well before 2008 that small island nation privatized its banks; then economists paid by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce wrote reports that praised the perilously fragile banking system. But no nation is an island these days. Cataclysmic events that began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG sent concentric tsunamis around the globe and the film reserves special fury for its contention that ""this crisis was not an accident--it was caused by an out-of-control financial sector."" (Mr. Fergusons co-writers were Chad Beck and Adam Bolt. Matt Damon delivers the narration with seething calm.) As circumstantial evidence ""Inside Job"" puts the toys of that sectors beneficiaries on display--the private jets the horses the houses and yachts--and lays out some of the astronomical salaries theyve received as rewards for failure as well as success. But Mr. Ferguson also provides historical context for his provocations--the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s the steady march of deregulation the advent of exotic derivatives. Iceland isnt the only place where the film contends the financial industry ""has corrupted the study of economics itself."" Among others interviewed on the subject Glenn Hubbard dean of Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Business is unresponsive and visibly shaken during a withering interrogation about his connections to financial-services firms. And the Obama administration gets as much of a drubbing as any other ""Its a Wall Street government"" a former president of the Greenlining Institute says. ""Its status quo."" After seeing ""Inside Job"" you dont have to be a tea partier to feel the anger thats sweeping the land. Its Kind of a Funny Story A clinically depressed teenager gets a new start after he checks himself into an adult psychiatric ward in the movie ""Its Kind of a Funny Story."" Think of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" blissed out on Wellbutrin and youve got a slight sense of ""Its Kind of a Funny Story."" The film itself is fairly slight Im not sure what it adds up to. Still I enjoyed every moment of its beguiling saga of a depressed teen named Craig who checks himself into a Manhattan hospital and ends up in an adult psychiatric ward full of wouldnt you know it screwy people. The directors were Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck; they adapted the screenplay from Ned Vizzinis young-adult novel. Craig is played by Keir Gilchrist from ""United States of Tara""; hes got a sweet spirit and a cockeyed Paul Simon smile. Of the patients he meets the most appealing is Noelle (Emma Roberts) and the most mysterious--and funny surprising and touching--is Bobby whos played with sensational verve by Zach Galifianakis. From time to time theres a bit of Mickey and Judy putting on mental illness; these arent tragic figures and arent meant to be. But Craig eventually comes to a useful understanding of where he belongs in the spectrum of human suffering. Id like to think of this graceful little movie as a fantasy about empathy as therapy.

"Movie review Its Kind of a Funny Story - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie review Its Kind of a Funny StoryScreenwriters Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck study teen angst dropping a troubled boy in a psych ward but its Zach Galifianakis who is the cure-all.October 08 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Zach Galifianakis foreground and Keir Gilchrist star in ""Its... (KC Bailey / Focus Features )""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" is kind of a perfect coming-of-age comedy with its bittersweet fun set loose in the adult psych ward of a Brooklyn hospital where this clever case of teenage depression identity and self-esteem is examined. But then theres nothing like being surrounded by serious craziness to put your own in perspective which is exactly what happens to bright success-obsessed 16-year-old Craig Gilner a bundle of complicated charm thanks to Keir Gilchrist ( ""United States of Tara""). The real revelation though is Zach Galifianakis best known until now for his turn as the slightly disturbed brother-in-law-to-be in "" The Hangover."" As Bobby the psych wards resident depressive-philosopher Galifianakis works his characters insights and neuroses like worry beads a effortlessly unceasingly and to marvelous effect. Weve already come to expect good things from the writing-directing team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck though theyve tended to traffic in far heavier emotional fare a character studies like ""Half Nelson"" in 2006 anchored by Ryan Goslings standout performance as a teacher in a drug-fueled downward spiral mixed in with excellent documentary work. Its nice to see that the filmmakers are equally adept at comedy a setting a brisk pace balancing light and dark moments keeping the dialogue crackling and the humor intelligent and indulging in inventive flights of fancy along the way. Thats no easy task to pull off since theyre tackling the very real pressure-cooker world of Type A teens who are forever worried that whatever they achieve will never quite be enough (and who like Craig often come with at least one Type A parent). Using Ned Vizzinis popular youth novel as the movies foundation the filmmakers have held fast to the books black comic sensibility but cracked opened Craigs world. Some characters have been bulked up Bobby most notably and pretty troubled teenage cutter Noelle with Emma Roberts dancing beautifully on a tightrope of appealing and enigmatic. But above all Fleck and Boden break the fourth wall brilliantly and frequently and that inventiveness is one of the films great charms. Craig moves seamlessly between conversations with us and his hospital stay when the moments are sometimes real sometimes imagined and sometimes rendered as complex cityscapes in pen and ink. Cinematographer Andrij Parekh an indie veteran who has collaborated frequently with Boden and Fleck does a masterful job of keeping those many worlds turning giving each a texture all its own. The story begins in crisis Craig is considering a suicidal dive off the Brooklyn Bridge both a boyhood touchstone and a short bike-ride from home a so meaningful and convenient. His is a typical teenage world of extremes where everything spells devastation and disaster a the cool girl he cant get the As he wont make the colleges he wont get into the life he wont have and then there is that problem of the projectile vomitinga|. Of course his best friend Aaron ( Thomas Mann) has won the heart of the cool girl Nia (ZoA<< Kravitz) gets the grades without studying and will no doubt have the vomit-free life Craig longs for. Craig has been in and out of therapy on and off Zoloft but coping like everything else eludes him. Instead of a leap off the bridge though Craig takes a leap of faith which is essentially the message of the movie (which thankfully comes with no heavy-handed pronouncements no ominous music). It is quite simply Dont be afraid to get help. Indeed asking for help the fear someone might find out you got help and actual help become the fast-moving emotional roller coaster that Craig will ride throughout the film. The story unfolds over the five days that Craig will be held for a basic psychological evaluation a not exactly the quick fix he was looking for when he showed up in the local emergency room. Though the days announce themselves usually on a black and white title card time is otherwise a very fluid proposition with counseling sessions visitors group activities meals chance encounters phone calls parents and patients turning up in such a random way that it keeps everyone a on screen and off a a bit unsettled. Its a neat trick that turns the film into an unpredictable grab-bag of funny tender ironic insightful poignant hopeful moments that keep surprising you. The dynamic between Craig and Bobby where wisdom is exchanged and the dynamic between Craig and Noelle where love and trust is the issue form the heart of the film. But a cast of exceedingly well-drawn characters surrounds them with a particularly nice turn by Viola Davis as the rock-steady hospital psychiatrist. Everything moves along to an extensive and appropriately angst-y alt-rock soundtrack as smartly mixed as the rest of the film. Music therapy day comes with a cover of the Queen- David Bowie classic ""Under Pressure"" that is manic and crazy (in a good way) and captures exactly what being a teenager is all about a kind of like ""Its Kind of a Funny Story."" betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCritics Notebook Movies show a kinder gentler side in...January 1 2011A Funny Story about two directorsOctober 7 2010Its Kind of a Funny Story Hospital misfitsSeptember 12 2010Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-funny-story-20101008,0,2180035.story",200,it'skindofafunnystory14,it'skindofafunnystory,latimes

The film skirts most (not all) of the potholes in its path and comes out the other side an imperfect but charming and heartfelt film. Droopy-voiced Keir Gilchrist stars as Craig a high-schooler with normal problems and an oversized case of teen angst. Overdue chemistry reports college applications girl problems and decent but clueless parents drive him up the wall and in his dreams over the railing of the Brooklyn Bridge. You see he chose to lay off the antidepressants that his family and doctor made him believe he needed and began to see life for what it is which is not always fun. He tells the emergency-room intake nurse ""I want to kill myself."" She hands him a clipboard and says ""Fill this out."" And so he finds himself on a mandatory five-day stay in the cuckoos nest. Gilchrist (of HBOs ""The United States of Tara"") is solid and sympathetic with twinges of embarrassment sneaking into the portrayal. He doesnt announce his emotions in capital letters. As the straight man to a gallery of oddballs he greets each new eccentric with a vaguely baffled disengaged deadpan. Among the patients are the charismatic wiseacre Bobby (Zach Galifianakis in a show-stealing semi-dramatic turn) and Noelle (Emma Roberts) a gifted unpredictable girl working out her own issues. Shes not the stablest log in the pond but shes winsome bright and interested and thats enough for Craig. A relationship begins to develop and every so often Bobby drops in to add a sardonic viewpoint. Craigs therapist Dr. Minerva (the always excellent Viola Davis) offers sound advice and Craig finds himself beginning to relax among the head cases. The ward is more homey and welcoming than his school or his familys apartment; its a place where you dont have to put on pretensions or walk on glass. The patients and staff convince the cloistered Craig to break out of his shell. He begins to have a genuine relationship with a girl who has a few problems of her own. For all its challenges its a lot more rewarding than fantasies about his best friends unattainable girl. Roberts is better than a stock love interest bringing a bruised kindness to the role that balances the films melancholy tone. Galifianakis who has been shoved down our throats for the past season or two as the hot new comic of the moment does his best work to date in a serious role. ITS KIND OF A FUNNY STORY  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for mature thematic issues sexual content drug material and language.  Where Lagoon. Writer/directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are not working at the high level of their earlier films ""Half Nelson"" and ""Sugar."" There are missteps in their showy use of animation sequences of still images and an exaggerated fantasy vignette that transforms the patients into a glitter band rocking out to David Bowies ""Under Pressure."" On the positive side they handle the actors well and have an innate sense of how to use locations to suggest emotion. A getaway to the hospital roof carries a worrisome undertone; Its a long way down from there. As always they give us a sense of connection to characters stuck in awkward dilemmas. In the end theres no panacea for Craigs problems; things dont get tied up neatly with his folks. But you feel hes heading down a good road. You ache for these people but not without hope.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + I guess it had to happen. With ""Its Kind of a Funny Story the filmmaking team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck go amiably soft on us. I wouldnt call it a sell-out but the latest from the duo who gave us the taut 2006 character drama ""Half Nelson and the wrenching 2009 minor-league baseball saga ""Sugar is their approximation of a Hollywood movie A feel-good teen fable about a New York City mental ward. In their defense few studio directors would be able to bring the warmly democratic touch to this subject that Fleck and Boden manage without even seeming to try. At the same time you sort of wish theyd tried harder.Based on a well-regarded 2006 autobiographical novel by the young writer Ned Vizzini ""Funny Story is about what happens when a privileged son of Park Slope Brooklyn hits the wall. Craig Gilner (Keir Gilchrist Toni Collettes son on TVs ""United States of Tara) feels like he cant keep up at his super-overachieving Manhattan high school (Vizzini went to Stuyvesant). Hes crushing on the girlfriend (Zoe Kravitz) of his best friend (Thomas Mann). And hes dreaming about jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge.Arriving at a hospital early one Sunday morning desperate for help Craig gets more than he bargained for when hes sent to 3 North the adult psych ward for a mandatory one-week stay. But I have to be at school tomorrow he yawps. Tough responds the wards head doctor (Viola Davis). Welcome home says Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) the wards orderly. Wait Bobby just likes to wear scrubs; hes actually one of the patients.So is Noelle (Emma Roberts) a pretty sardonic teenager with a Stooges T-shirt and scars on her wrists. Other patients in Craigs new community of lovable misfits include his roommate Muqtada (Bernard White) a depressed Egyptian who never leaves his bed; Solomon (Daniel London) a Hasidic Jew who freaked out after too many hits of acid; the tender Humble (Matthew Maher); and the hostile Johnny (Adrian Martinez). But Bobby takes the cake for sheer charismatic dysfunctionality -- hes the Randle Patrick McMurphy of 3 North.Which makes Craig his Billy Bibbit I suppose except that ""Its Kind of a Funny Story is more interested in gentle human comedy and easy life lessons than rebellion and tragedy. (Tellingly theres no Nurse Ratched here.) Boden and Fleck try their hand at what are for them whimsical touches deadpan freeze frames candy-colored fantasy flashbacks and a full-on musical staging of Queens ""Under Pressure with all the 3 North patients and staff taking part. Its the sort of thing that ""Glee does twice an episode without breaking a sweat.Maybe thats being mean but it hints at whats largely missing from ""Its Kind of a Funny Story genuine emotional pain. Still the movies an often charming example of ""Cuckoos Nest Lite and I imagine that any teenagers who feel misunderstood and overwhelmed (oh right that would be all of them) will relate to Craigs upper-middle-class angst. Hes a kid whose childhood innocence ended with 9/11 global warming and relentless college prep. You feel for him even as you cant help thinking about the people with real problems.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

In literature theater and film teenagers can be found grappling with depression addiction eating disorders suicidal urges.And for all the pain depicted (the gnashing of teeth the slashing of wrists) theres something romantic too about the idea of being taken out of school and home and put in a clean white room. There are attendants with pills a sloping lawn with a garden perhaps and poems to read or Nick Drake to bob your melancholy head to.Of course the reality of a psych ward is something else.And in Its Kind of a Funny Story a smart but suicidal 16-year-old comes up against the real world of a New York City mental facility - well kind of like the title says.A gentle and not altogether successful adaptation of Ned Vizzinis popular young-adult novel Its Kind of a Funny Story hails from the filmmaking duo of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck ace indie neorealists (Half Nelson Sugar) trying their hand at something decidedly more commercial. The writing/directing team have cited John Hughes and his high school oeuvre as inspiration and influence - Ferris Bueller Interrupted. Theres even a musical fantasy number here and zippy little cartoon sequences in which the busy ""brain maps"" drawn by our young hero Craig (Keir Gilchrist) turn animated take flight and get too cute for their own good.So Craig contemplating a swan dive off the Brooklyn Bridge checks himself into a hospital one dark Sunday eve. And because theres construction in the juvenile wing he finds himself on the floor with the grown-up mental patients the catatonic the schizophrenic and the Galifianakis - as in Zach. The Hangover whackjob and stand-up comedian turns the volume down several notches to play Bobby a fragile soul suffering from bouts of despair and a general inability to cope with the business of living.But Bobby has aced things inside 3 North donning scrubs for covert off-floor missions and he and Craig form a friendship - two wounded dudes talking about ""bird-dogging chicks"" and the daunting responsibilities of fatherhood.Theres a girl too Noelle (Emma Roberts) wary and introverted with a seriously self-destructive side. Over the five days Craig spends in the ward he and Noelle go through their cuckoos-nest courtship.Gilchrist low-key and watchful brings considerable conviction to his role; his Craig is sympathetically drawn. Galifianakis gives his nutcase real dignity Roberts is wispy and sweet and Viola Davis delivers gravitas in her few minutes as the wards head administrator. However the casting of Lauren Graham as Craigs (understandably worried) mom and Jeremy Davies as a kooky kooky medic is egregiously predictable.And if theres a psych ward for motion pictures Its Kind of a Funny Story should check itself in. Boden and Flecks film suffers from bipolar disorder manic and silly one minute moody and muted the next.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Share Tweet With Sugar the follow-up to their powerful debut feature Half Nelson the writer/director team of Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden defied the expectations and conventions of the baseball movie to an almost perverse degree. It simply refused to give audiences the heartwarming payoffs theyre accustomed to getting. The arthouse duo appears to be making up for lost time however with Its Kind of A Funny Story an adaptation of a popular young adult novel that lovingly embraces all the crowd-pleasing formula that Sugar and Half Nelson eschewed. Keir Gilchrist stars as an earnest young man who checks himself into a mental hospital over stupid teenage stuff Hes nursing a painful crush on the girlfriend of an overachieving friend and is aquiver with anxiety over applying to a prestigious summer school program. Gilchrist hopes to pop in resolve his issues then pop out but discovers that he must stay in the hospital for a minimum of five days. Gilchrist soon falls under the sway of Zach Galifianakis a charismatic but troubled older patient who takes him under his wing. Galifianakis magnetic performance suggests murky psychological depths the film doesnt have the substance to plumb. Beneath his gnomic surface lies a surplus of pain and rage that slips out at inconvenient moments. Its revelatory work but Fleck and Boden too often relegate Galifianakis to the background to concentrate on the less compelling story of Gilchrist experiencing years worth of character-building life lessons in five action-packed days. Especially in its final act Story trades verisimilitude for hokey cliches and embraces a painfully banal romantic subplot where Gilchrist has to choose between the dream girl for whom hes long been pining and a quirky self-destructive patient played by Emma Roberts. Though engaging and sweet with a nice feel for the purgatory-like blankness of mental hospital life Its Kind Of A Funny Story suffers from a serious if not quite fatal attack of the cutes. The only known antidote for this crippling depressingly ubiquitous affliction is a straight dose of the truth--a quality that for all its good intentions and strong supporting performances the film lacks.

"Its Kind of a Funny Story review Filmmaking duo good even not at their best - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Its Kind of a Funny Story review Filmmaking duo good even not at their bestIts Kind of a Funny Story a 3 starsOctober 07 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticSome films are at once disappointing and successful worth seeing despite the limitations of their source material. How so? Let ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" explain it all for you. This is the third feature from the writing-directing team of Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. Their first film ""Half Nelson"" gave Ryan Gosling his most interesting role to date as a heroin-addicted high school teacher. Their second an even richer character study called ""Sugar"" followed a Dominican baseball player as he travels to America to make his bid for the majors encountering Arizona diner menus and Iowa cornfields and (ensuring an excellent films boxoffice failure) a career path quite unlike his initial great expectations. With ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" Fleck and Bodens first film based on a novel its a different story capped -- rightly or wrongly -- by an extremely happy ending the filmmakers do their best to earn. Theyve adapted Ned Vizzinis young-adult best-seller about a teenage boys five days spent in a Brooklyn psychiatric hospital. The point of view belongs to Craig ( Keir Gilchrist) a 16-year-old under persistent pressure from his parents ( Jim Gaffigan and Lauren Graham) to produce a crackerjack entrance essay for a schmantzy summer school program. Depressed and off his Zoloft Craig considers suicide but calls a hot line instead. Checking himself into the facility ( Viola Davis plays his supervising doctor) he finds an adoptive-uncle figure in Bobby ( Zach Galifianakis) who has been there awhile. Craig also finds romance thanks to fellow patient Noelle ( Emma Roberts) survivor of a cutting incident and a better match for Craigs personality than the boys long-pined-for high school classmate Nia (Zoe Kravitz). Fleck and Boden acknowledge ""The Breakfast Club"" as an influence here and you can see what theyre going for with their blend of pathos and humor. In key ways though their sensibility isnt anything like John Hughes. For one thing their commercial instincts are far less ruthlessly driven by ""types"" of kids and adults. And thats good. Fleck and Boden have a knack for lending a documentary daily-life quality to their exchanges. As a result an actor as potentially shticky as Galifianakis comes off movingly in a role you dont necessarily buy. Gilchrist keeps things very low-key even monotonously so but hes honest. Hes a prime reactor and doesnt force a single beat. The result is both a success and a disappointment. ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" divided into neat little daylong chapters in Craigs stay lacks the staying power and bittersweet layering of ""Half Nelson"" and ""Sugar."" Yet it holds together.

Bailey) B Its Kind of a Funny Story Genre Comedy Drama; Starring Zach Galifianakis Emma Roberts Viola Davis; Director Anna Boden Ryan Fleck; Author Anna Boden Ryan Fleck; Release Date Limited 09/24/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 101 Posted October 8 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Zach Galifianakis fits right in as a patient in a Brooklyn loony bin in the gentle the-kids-will-eventually-be-all-right drama Its Kind of a Funny Story. Thats not because the star of The Hangover is doing his surrealistic semi-stoned comedy thing here -- although as Bobby one of the wards more outsize personalities he sometimes does. (The comic cant help it.) But rather in keeping with the even-keeled and optimistic tone of this youth-oriented movie (written and directed by Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden and based on Ned Vizzinis semiautobiographical young-adult novel of time spent in a similar struggle) the densely built and bearded Galifianakis demonstrates in an impressive display of quieter dramatic skills that he knows when to dial it down. From the minute Craig (United States of Taras Keir Gilchrist) a possibly suicidal 16-year-old checks himself in for safekeeping Bobby keeps an avuncular eye on the nice stressed-out kid. Craig also meets a nice equally fragile girl (Emma Roberts) with whom he can share anxieties. And as if all this werent lucky enough Craigs empathetic shrink is played by Viola Davis -- although I miss the surprise of casting lesser-known actors a specialty of the filmmakers in their outstanding previous features (Half Nelson and Sugar). Its Kind of a Funny Story may be the first psych-ward drama to draw on John Hughes movies for tonal reference; the filmmakers have said that for inspiration they screened The Breakfast Club for the cast and crew. If the homage feels strained at times the energy level is revived by the inclusion of some lovely visual and aural grace notes including bits of sweet animation music by Broken Social Scene and the wacky sight of Galifianakis disguised in doctor scrubs.

Jones on 09.15.10 at 1200 PM Dying is easy but comedy is hard as the saying goes. Im not sure where drama fits in but Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck the writing and directing team who made Half Nelson (2006) and Sugar (2008) create a fine ensemble cast for this third feature by combining skilled character actors (Viola Davis Jeremy Davies Adrian Martinez) and professional comedians playing straight (Zach Galifianakis Jim Gaffigan Aasif Mandvi). The resulting story about a depressed high schooler (Keir Gilchrist) who naively checks himself into a hospital psychiatric ward and then discovers he has to stay five days for observation inhabits that wonderful and elusive space between comedy and drama where genuine human behavior resides. Ultimately the kids problems are less interesting than the whackos surrounding him but that prevents the movies coming-of-age narrative from becoming too pat like the space between comedy and drama the one between sanity and insanity is where real life takes place. Its Kind of a Funny Story opens in Chicago on October 8.

Hot for his best friends girlfriend stressed out over an application to a prestigious summer school and audaciously neglectful of his Zoloft 16-year-old Craig (Keir Gilchrist) commits himself to a psych ward after tepid fantasies of jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge start warming.Twenty years after Heathers had its anarchic way with tin-eared adult solutions to teen problems the specter of suicide still haunts student life (and attendant news-cycle opportunism) with the recent Tyler Clementi tragedy serving as a sad reminder. But while Heathers dove into truly dark corners of the adolescent psyche writer-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck work overtime to keep cuddly Craig safe from self-harm.Despite his privileged race class and access to superlative specialized public education Craig is posited as a universalized figure stressed out in a banal ""We all hate homework"" tenor with suicidal tendencies hazy to the point of insincere. Were never granted real-time access to his school life never shown incidents that might have set him off. Like most people he gives the idea of suicide some thought but thats about it. Through voiceover he describes the grim predicaments that send some people over the edge before assuring that ""my problems are less dramatic than that."" For Craig suicide is hyperbole. ""I just need you to help me"" he pleads to the E.R. physician blinking big coal eyes like a baby Keanu. And away we go.With this Young Adult riff on One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Boden and Fleck at first glance seem far afield from the sociorealism of their previous features Half Nelson and Sugar. Much as there was to admire about those films--particularly Andrij Parekhs searching cinematography and several strong naturalistic performances--there was also a nagging self-seriousness laundry-list liberalism (on race class drugs immigration etc.) an anthropological (and thus dimly exploitative) distance from characters and a willingness to cede story to good intentions. Rather than a humorous departure from such proclivities Its Kind of a Funny Story doubles down uniting broad comedy with leaden sloganeering for a super-sincere tonally awry amusement tour of post-9/11 despair.Besides Craig who at one point attributes his depression to war the failing economy and environmental uncertainty we meet an eclectic community of colorful New York characters mentally challenged by modern living a woman gone paranoid because of the Patriot Act; an acid-fried Hasid with sensitive hearing; a Tourettic schizophrenic whose random shout-outs play as punchline prophesy; a bed-bound Egyptian who offers cryptic Yoda-like nuggets of wisdom; and our heros in-house father figure Bobby (Zach Galifianakis taking his first step toward Robin Williams-paved sad-clown legitimacy) whos caught in a cycle of unemployment poverty and rage. ""What I would do to be you for a day"" he tells Craig but instead of a note of resentment or even a soft critique of entitlement its meant as affirmation. It really is great to be Craig whose election to the nuthouse does wonders for his ego and reputation. In five short days he learns that hes a master illustrator a natural singer (his performance of ""Under Pressure"" devolves into a risible lip-synched fantasy sequence featuring all the crazies decked out in glam wear) and drawn to traveling volunteering and saving the world.When classmates learn why Craigs not in school he becomes a small sensation in absentia recalling Ferris Buellers Day Offs wave of ""Save Ferris"" hysteria. But rather than mock the movie grants him his newfound notoriety--much like it lets his rocker cutter crush Noelle (Emma Roberts) sport peacock-chic cheek scars like Adam Ant Apache streaks. As the young lovers scamper down hospital halls and embrace on the roof with the skyline--and Broken Social Scenes brightly reassuring score--as accompaniment its clear their joy doesnt just come from realizing that life is precious but also that they lead precious lives. ""I used to think art was just bourgeois decadence"" a wiser Craig says in the end which is funny because thats kind of what this film is.

The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 17 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Sep. 16 2010 120PM EDT Comments Print /License AA The following short reviews of some of the films opening and screening on Friday Sept. 17 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival are by James Adams James Bradshaw Guy Dixon Rick Groen Liam Lacey Gayle MacDonald Dave McGinn J. Kelly Nestruck Johanna Schneller and Brad Wheeler. The star ratings are out of four. OPENING A Beginners Guide to Endings Jonathan Sobol (Canada) 2 STARS Writer-director Jonathan Sobol (a Canadian making his feature debut) is obviously enamoured with guys guys and here he gives us a fistful a wayward drunk gambling dad (Harvey Keitel) and the three grown sons he inadvertently screwed over the tough one (Jason Jones) the responsible one (Paulo Costanzo) and the womanizing one (Scott Caan). The story covers one frantic week in which they all attempt to change their lives and the plot is one of those where seemingly disparate threads escalate until they all come together in cathartic coincidence. While I got it I didnt quite buy it. Still its fun to watch the brothers punch each other around and I always love seeing J.K. Simmons who plays Keitels voice-of-reason preacher brother. But the revelation here is Jones the Hamilton-born actor primarily known as a correspondent for The Daily Show (and as Mr. Samantha Bee) who is as riveting as his handlebar mustache. J.S. Sept. 17 630 p.m. Roy Thomson; Sept. 18 1145 a.m. Varsity 8 ALSO SCREENING Bunraku Guy Moshe (USA) 3 STARS In this hyper-stylized mash up thats part western and part martial-arts flick Josh Hartnett plays a mysterious stranger who is out for revenge against a crime boss known as the Nicola the Woodcutter. At his side is Yoshi played by the Japanese actor and musician Gackt a warrior seeking to recoup a medallion in the Woodcutters possession. In a dystopian world without guns it is up to the two of them to fight their way through the many killers in the Woodcutters gang with the help of a bartender played by Woody Harrelson who knows how to navigate the treacherous world of the underground. With a graphic style that is reminiscent of 300 and Sin City the film whose title refers to a 400-year-old form of Japanese puppet theatre can sometimes venture into cartoonish territory. But with great chemistry between Hartnett and Gackt and incredible visuals the ambitions of director Guy Moshes sophomore feature more than make up for what it lacks in substance. D.M. Sept. 17 5 p.m. Scotiabank 2 Armadillo Janus Metz (Denmark) 3 STARS Like the recent U.S. documentary Restrepo this Danish doc takes viewers directly into combat in Afghanistan as it follows a Danish platoon on a six-month tour of duty. The film took the top prize at this years Critics Week at Cannes and its easy to see why. The cinematography is artistically varied and often shot amazingly in the direct line of gunfire and bursting mortar. Like Restrepo this is all about showing the rawness of war and the documentary has perhaps inevitably sparked debate in Denmark about the nature in which its forces are being used in Afghanistan. But theres another controversy of the more cinematic kind While the footage is expertly photographed all the different uses of filters and postproduction colour correction (to say nothing of the superb sound) - which gives the film an almost Apocalypse Now quality at times - is disturbing when were talking not about the mythology and madness of war but about showing real dead people in a ditch or actual children running from fighting. Itll depend on where the viewer stands in that debate. G.D.

Having spun two uncommonly smart tough-minded dramas with ""Half Nelson"" and ""Sugar"" writing-directing duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden make a gently disarming segue into pure comedy with ""Its Kind of a Funny Story."" Adapting Ned Vizzinis novel about a suicidal teens five-day stint in a psychiatric ward the filmmakers fully retain their offbeat sensibility and attentiveness to character while providing perhaps the sharpest showcase yet for Zach Galifianakis outsized talents. Result is easily their most commercial feature but in no way represents an artistic compromise suggesting Focus could parlay warm reviews into kind of a decent specialty haul. A beautiful nighttime shot of New York places us inside the head of 15-year-old Craig Gilner (Keir Gilchrist ""United States of Tara"") whos about to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge more to the disapproval than the concern of his parents (Jim Gaffigan Lauren Graham) and younger sister (Dana De Vestern). As he tells us in voiceover Craig may be dreaming but his desire to off himself is real enough stemming from intense academic pressure; a lifelong crush on his best friends g.f. Nia (Zoe Kravitz); and a recent unwise decision to go off his meds. Skinny awkward and prone to vomiting at random Craig consults a doctor (Aasif Mandvi) and inadvertently gets himself admitted to the hospitals psychiatric wing for a minimum five-day stay. But with the youth ward temporarily closed Craig is forced to take up residence in the adult ward run with calm smiling efficiency by Dr. Eden Minerva (Viola Davis) yet ruled by longtime patient Bobby (Galifianakis) who takes Craig under wing (so to speak) during his short stay. A genial wacko who likes to wear scrubs and displays an occasional belligerent streak Bobby initiates Craig into the wards group activities which include drawing and band performance; the latter builds to the films most out-there sequence a musicvideo-style performance of Queens ""Under Pressure"" that doesnt feel entirely organic but delights all the same as a nutty expression of team solidarity. The wards other residents include Craigs reclusive Egyptian roommate (Bernard White whose face only gradually emerges from beneath the bedcovers); a patient with extremely sensitive hearing (""Old Joys"" very funny Daniel London); and a comely 16-year-old Noelle (Emma Roberts) whom Craig naturally finds himself drawn to. Like some exceedingly benign coming-of-age spin on ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" conceives of a mental hospital as a place where a normal but stressed-out kid can work out his issues (in less than a week) in the company of older wiser if not necessarily better-adjusted companions. Yet while the film is fanciful its never precious and it has none of the smothering archness the eccentricity for eccentricitys sake one might expect from this kind of indie quirkfest. Fleck and Bodens touch is gentle at times lighter than air and they can coax laughs from their material with something as offhand as a quick cut (Boden as usual handled editing duties). While Gilchrist is winningly earnest as a teenager in the grip of suicidal paranoia the pic is most impressive as a conduit for Galifianakis electric comic persona. Where the recent studio-based ""Dinner for Schmucks"" showed the thesp at his most undisciplined ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" offers a lesson in how a little subtlety can go a long way. Here Galifianakis is metaphorically if not literally straitjacketed and theres something fiercely poignant about Bobbys deadpan scowl (making the actor at times resemble an angry overgrown owl) as well as his tender exchanges with Craig allowing him to be the father figure he clearly isnt to his actual briefly seen family. Counting down the days until Craigs departure the film gets a lot of mileage out of the single location to which its confined for most of the zippy 100-minute running time. The ward is colorfully populated but realistically assembled by production designer Beth Mickle and art director Mike Ahern furthering the sense that this ""Story"" is set in a twilight zone between fantasy and reality. Music is credited to Toronto-based band Broken Social Scene which also provided tunes for ""Half Nelson.""

Daily Edition Login to download Its Kind of a Funny Story -- Film Review 214 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS From its reliance on cutesy cutaways to the leads languid observations -- occasionally directly into the camera -- the treatment of the material seldom feels fresh or interesting. TWITTER The latest collaboration from the directing and writing team responsible for ""Half Nelson"" concerns a questionably suicidal 16-year-old who checks himself into a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately the heavily medicated vibe also extends to the film. ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" based on a 2006 semi-autobiographical novel by Ned Vizzini is a dramatically inert lethargic dramedy that isnt nearly as quirky and poignant is it perceives itself. From its reliance on cutesy cutaways to the leads languid observations -- occasionally directly into the camera -- the treatment of the material seldom feels fresh or interesting save for a sensitive Zach Galifianakis performance as a fellow patient. Despite the titles indication of being a quasi-comedy Focus Features could have a tricky time convincing a committed audience. Running the gamut from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" to ""Girl Interrupted"" psych ward movies have long captured the imagination of the worlds filmmakers. Vizzinis young-adult novel had the hook of taking in all the scenery from the p.o.v. of its reasonably sane if stressed teen protagonist who one day calls a suicide hotline and is advised to head straight for the hospital. Not quite sure of what hes gotten himself into Craig Gilner (Keir Gilchrist) finds himself being admitted as the newest patient at Brooklyns Argenon Hospital placed on the adult floor since the youth ward is closed for renovations. He almost immediately finds a mentor in the form of Bobby (an affectingly introspective Galifianakis) and a potential love interest in Noelle (a solid Emma Roberts) a troubled young woman with the self-inflicted facial cuts to prove it. Then of course theres the requisite assortment of wacky supporting roles. That unfettered matter-of-fact storytelling technique which has served Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden so well in the past simply doesnt serve the milieu this time around having the opposite effect of stifling the production rather than freeing it from conventionality. It also doesnt help that while its clear the filmmakers were in the market for a Zach Braff/Justin Long-type lead Keir a regular on ""United States of Tara"" isnt in possession of their easy charisma. The talents of the usually impressive Viola Davis meanwhile are wasted here in the role of staff psychiatrist Dr. Eden Minerva whose name proves more interesting than her scaled-back character. Only Galifianakis emerges as the one memorable patient running this otherwise unremarkable asylum.
