Comments Shoot Em Up Even if youre square enough to find celebrations of mass slaughter tacky its hard to deny that Clive Owen drives carrots through his opponents skulls with such stylish panache you forget real carrots arent lethal. Similarly the way he casually mows down a mob while spontaneously delivering a baby in the opening sequence makes it seem only reasonable that hed bully a prostitute (Monica Bellucci) into nursing it while the trio flee from cackling villainous Paul Giamatti or that shed quickly fall in love with her laconic abuser interrupting her maternal duties only long enough to raise some cash by giving a blow job in an alley. One can certainly be amused and entertained by writer-director Michael Daviss hyperbolic action frolics--I was--but not without feeling pretty low and stupid. R 87 min.

"Shoot Dont Bite the Bullet washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Shoot Dont Bite the Bullet Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday September 7 2007 ""Shoot Em Up"" is set in that modern hell where stories go to die the pop gunk hole of movies video games and graphic novels. It has no relation to life on Earth Mars or Alpha Centauri. Directed after a style that might be called I-read-too-many-comics-and-now-dont-know-whats-real by Michael Davis (see In Focus on Page 32) it stars Clive Owen (he has been better) as a freelance gunman who saves a baby from an assassination squad of black-leather-coat-wearing (warning Dont buy a black leather coat or Owen will come and kill you) thugs led by Paul Giamatti (he also has been better). On the run with the baby the gunman teams with lactating prostitute Monica Bellucci (she has been much better) to try to -- well what? Get away? Who can tell? Its just gunfights strung together without a whisper of coherence or meaning. The fights are staged so that they all look the same and the principle is always the same The gunmans multiple antagonists never hit and he never misses. John Woo at least had fun with this sort of thing 20 years ago. And Giamatti? What the heck is he doing here? -- Stephen Hunter Shoot Em Up R 87 minutes Contains violence profanity and sexual content. Area theaters.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post |I dont need a lot of research to be confident in stating that never before have I seen a movie open with the hero delivering a baby during a gun battle severing the umbilical cord with a gunshot and then killing a villain by penetrating his brain with a raw carrot. Yes a carrot will do that in this movie. It will do a lot of things. ""Shoot Em Up"" written and directed by the gung-ho Michael Davis is the most audacious implausible cheerfully offensive hyperactive action picture Ive seen since oh ""Sin City"" which in comparison was a chamber drama. That I liked ""Shoot Em Up"" is a consequence of a critical quirk I sometimes notice I may disapprove of a movie for going too far and yet have a sneaky regard for a movie that goes much much further than merely too far. This one goes so far if you even want to get that far you have to start halfway there which means you have to be a connoisseur of the hard-boiled action genre and its serio-comic subdivision (or sub-basement). The film opens in one of those grimy cityscapes where a little graffiti might brighten things up. A man with 10 oclock shadow (Clive Owen) sits on a bench eating a carrot. A pregnant woman is chased past him by men intent on murdering her. ""Bloody hell"" says the man a phrase I find so much more elegant than ""What the foosball underwater clockmaker kitchen"" if you enjoy creating acronyms. He defends the woman in a hail of gunfire while delivering her baby ramming the carrot into his victims cranium and finding himself on the run with an infant in his arms which is how Owen spent much of ""Children of Men"" also with people shooting at him so you could say he looks right at home. The Owen character is named Mr. Smith. The leader of his enemies is Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti). No Mr. Brown around anywhere but Tarantino seems to hover over the action like a guardian skycam. I am not sure why Mr. Smith is so capable during acts of violence but it may be because Owen practiced up while he was being considered for the role of James Bond. Yes that might explain the scene where he continues a gun battle while jumping out of an airplane without a parachute. That was probably one of the scenes Michael Davis drew by hand thousands of drawings to give the illusion of animation when he made his pitch to the studio. This is a determined guy. I remember 10 years ago he wanted me to see his ""Eight Days a Week"" at the Slamdance film festival. I was covering Sundance which is itself three full-time jobs but he kept after me ominously brandishing a carrot. I made the trek uphill in the snow to a hotel lobby where his film was being shown and found a spot on a sofa. And the movie was a wonderful comedy about a kid so in love with a girl that he sets up camp and lives in her front yard a whole summer before she finally agrees to go out with him. So theres your auteur theory at work Davis likes movies about men who will go to any lengths for a woman. Comedy is a tricky genre to give an unknown indie his start however so Davis switched to the usual indie port of entry horror making among others a movie about road kill that wants to kill you. ""Shoot Em Up"" will become I suspect some kind of legend in the murky depths of extreme action. What elevates it from the depraved to the deserving is a sense of style a sense of warped humor and the acting. Clive Owen brings what credibility there could possibly be to his character and makes us believe it as much as we possibly can. Paul Giamatti Hollywoods favorite nerd is surprisingly teeth-gnashingly evil. And Monica Bellucci is DQ the hooker with the heart of gold who becomes Mr. Smiths partner and the babys surrogate mother. I thought and thought about what ""DQ"" could possibly stand for and finally had my eureka moment Dairy Queen. The plot (two words that should be followed by a hollow laugh) involves Mr. Hertz being hired by Sen. Rutledge (Daniel Pilon) political party unspecified who is running for president but learns he is dying and can only be saved by the bone marrow of infants. In the old days when political campaigns didnt run so long there would have been no time to impregnate surrogate volunteers and harvest their offspring another argument against the extended presidential campaign season. Man am I gonna get mail from people who hate this picture. Ill fall back on my stock defense Did I or did I not accurately describe the film? You have been informed. Now eat your carrots.

Seconds later a car comes crashing out of nowhere and this angry geezer gets out and threatens to kill the woman. So Owen strolls over and shoves his carrot through the guys mouth and then get this delivers the womans child by shooting the umbilical cord. Then all hell breaks loose with as many as a dozen gunmen appearing from nowhere. Owen kills them all. In the first two minutes.What follows is a relentless barrage of improbable shootouts so plentiful its like watching someone play Halo on Xbox. It transpires that mind-reading hitman Mr Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and his platoon of thugs have been hired to kill the child because of a bone-marrow racket being perpetrated by an unknown authority figure. This is seedy morally defunct low-IQ cinema for airheads its toe-curlingly violent and mostly plain nasty but quite fun in a debauched kind of way. It deserves a couple of stars but only for Giamatti who stands out as an effective badman.

Cheesy one-liners an absurd carrot motif and a relentless succession of mainly unimaginative action sequences - although the scene in which a naked Clive Owen kills a series of villains while simultaneously bringing Monica Bellucci to ecstasy has a certain verve. But mostly it is like the fantasy of an indulged teenager who fancies himself as a bit of an auteur. It may be a pastiche although I doubt that it has that intelligence but if so it is a very inferior example.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 25 2007NickyFeaturedBrilliant film.

"Shoot Em Up Noisily absurd plot | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesShoot Em Up Noisily absurd plotIf John Woo had directed a Bugs Bunny cartoon written by the creators of South Park  the result might be something like Shoot `Em Up  but with a crucial difference Bugs Bunny cartoons were always less than 10 minutes long.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Sept. 7 2007 Starring Clive Owen Paul Giamatti and Monica Bellucci. Written and directed by Michael Davis. 91 minutes. At major theatres. 18A   Article Continued BelowIf John Woo had directed a Bugs Bunny cartoon written by the creators of South Park the result might be something like Shoot `Em Up but with a crucial difference Bugs Bunny cartoons were always less than 10 minutes long.Written and directed by the hitherto direct-to-DVD processor Michael Davis Shoot `Em Up comes off the screen with both the subtlety and velocity of a hurled brick. After witnessing several leathered-up thugs chasing a pregnant woman down an alley the tersely-named (and equally leathered-up) Smith - who is played with phoned-in cool by Clive Owen - takes a disgusted chomp of his dont-take-me-seriously carrot and proceeds to atomize said thugs in a virtuoso display of amped-up synthetic carnage.Along the way he uses the vegetable as a lethal weapon helps deliver the baby by shooting through the umbilical cord and demonstrates a way with a tossed-off quip that would probably be infinitely more amusing if actually funny. Example after dispatching yet another bevy of thugs who have burst in on Smith and the wet-nursing prostitute Donna (Monica Bellucci) while they are in a state of amorous entanglement - from which they do not disentangle - Smith quips ""Now thats shooting your load."" And thats exactly what the relentlessly out-to-wow kiss-kiss-bang-bang Shoot `Em Up does from opening to closing credits as it careens through a noisily absurd plot about artificial insemination political corruption lactating hookers and guns guns guns.Pursued pointlessly by the pipsqueak assassin played by Paul Giamatti Smith and the scarlet Madonna played by Bellucci make their merry mayhem-jacked way through the barely disguised streets of Toronto with their baby their bullets and their value-added movie star bodies clearly having way more fun than anybody being shot at by a virtual army of ACTRA members has any reasonable right to. And certainly I might add than I did.And yes the ""Whats up doc?"" line is actually used.But I like my cartoons the same way I like Giamatti short and funny.

Photo Credit James Dittiger/New Line Cinema Description Clive Owen stars as Mr. Smith in New Line Cinemas action thriller SHOOT EM UP. Photo Credit James Dittiger/New Line Cinema Photo James Dittiger Review Shoot Em Up a bloodbath without guilty fun to redeem it 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Shoot Em Up Action thriller. Starring Clive Owen Paul Giamatti and Monica Bellucci. Directed By Michael Davis. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Shoot Em Up"" is not only the title of Hollywoods latest descent into nonsensical mayhem but pretty much sums up the entire inane plot as well. A mysterious loner named Smith (Clive Owen) uses 18 guns to protect a newborn whom a gang of thugs want dead. The thugs shoot at the apparently bulletproof Smith and he shoots back with far greater success. Bang bang theyre all dead. Roll closing credits. There are signs that writer-director Michael Davis intended this movie to be a spoof along the lines of ""Grindhouse"" - upbeat music accompanying the sound of gunshots for example and death by insertion of a carrot. Announcing that he doesnt like old guys wearing ponytails Smith takes aim at one and blows it away. But Davis is no Quentin Tarantino. Gallons of blood spurt during ""Shoot Em Up."" Being bloody however is not the same as pulpy and Davis lacks the winking eye that makes pulp movie fiction such a guilty pleasure. You never get the urge to laugh inappropriately at torture scenes such as a characters fingers being methodically broken one by one. You might however want to cry at the waste of talent that went into this mindless bloodbath including Peter Pau Oscar-winning director of photography for ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and Colin Chilvers whose visual effects in the first ""Superman"" won a special achievement Oscar. Even more distressing is the presence of Owen and Paul Giamatti. I understand the concept of working as much as possible while youre hot but its a slippery slope. Sean Penn once said his former friend Nicolas Cage ""has become a performer not an actor."" If the supremely gifted Owen and Giamatti dont want that said of them they need to realize that the movies actors say yes to are revealing and can and will come back to haunt them. Giamatti appears as Hertz (what not Avis?) a former FBI profiler gone over to the dark side as the gangs ring leader. Giamatti looked far more comfortable lifting a glass of wine in ""Sideways"" than a pistol. Gunfights just arent his thing which is a good thing. Owens deadpan portrayal of Smith is initially amusing. Hes first seen sitting on a bench Forrest Gump-like waiting for a bus when a very pregnant woman dashes by. He winds up delivering her baby by C-section during a barrage of bullets that kills her. Smiths awkward relationship with this quickly orphaned kid is the only part of the movie with even a whiff of humanity. He makes himself the gangs target by appearing to still have the infant whom he has pawned off on a prostitute (Monica Bellucci not given anything to do except look beautiful) while he investigates the evil plotters. The reason the baby must die slowly seeps out and makes about as much sense as everything else in ""Shoot Em Up."" The reason the movie got made remains a mystery too. -- Advisory Extreme violence.

Owens shadowy character Smith is minding his own business when he spies a very pregnant woman fleeing from a car full of gunmen on the streets of Manhattan (none-too-convincingly impersonated by Toronto). A chase and a heavy crossfire ensues with one bad guy killed by a well-aimed carrot. Smith not only delivers the baby - he severs the umbilical cord with a bullet. When the woman doesnt survive the hail of bullets Smith enlists the help of a lactating hooker (Monica Bellucci) to serve as a wet-nurse while our hero tries to figure out why someone is now trying to kill the baby. The answer is ridiculous Hertz (Giamatti) and his men want to eliminate the baby who was conceived through artificial insemination before agents of an ailing presidential candidate (Daniel Pilon) can harvest the babys bone marrow for his benefit. There are many more absurd plot twists and an elaborate back-story for Smith. But basically theyre an excuse to spoof over-the-top action sequences - bullets whizzing by a newborn - and to provide Owen the opportunity to deliver a nonstop stream of cheesy James Bond-ish one-liners (""talk about shooting your load""). Director Michael Davis who is graduating from made-for-video cheapies handles the material with great style and wit especially when Smith is forced to conduct a shootout in the nude while having sex with Bellucci. Cast against type the normally schlubby Giamatti seems to be having a ball even though his characters pursuit of Smith is constantly interrupted by calls from his nagging wife. ""Do you know why a gun is better than a wife?"" he exasperatedly asks a henchman. ""You can put a silencer on a gun."" You know Quentin Tarantino is probably over the hill when he can be so parodied with such deadly precision in ""Shoot Em Up."" SHOOT EM UP  Hits the target. Running time 87 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence sex profanity). At the Empire the Chelsea the East 86th Street others.

Action thriller about a mysterious gunman a hooker and the abandoned baby theyre protecting from a mob. With Clive Owen Monica Bellucci Paul Giamatti. Director Michael Davis (120). R Action-violence language sexuality/nudity. At area theaters. If the price of a ticket to writer-director Michael Davis aptly titled ""Shoot Em Up"" was based on the number of bullets fired - or bodies hit (pretty much the same) - you couldnt afford it. Throw in a per-laugh surcharge and Donald Trump couldnt afford it. This is likely the fastest-moving intentionally funny action movie ever made. Its as if the 21 Bond movies and four ""Die Hards"" had been distilled to remove their body fat (that is character development buildup rest stops etc.) and left us with only the killing and the punch lines. Clive Owen plays a mysterious gunman named Smith who is as quick of wit as of trigger and whose exterior cool masks a heart as warm as the muzzle of a recently fired .357 magnum. That heart gets him in immediate trouble. In the long and representative pre-credit opening he comes to the aid of a woman giving birth who is being chased by gunmen eliminates the brigade-size force and escapes a warehouse carrying the womans corpse with the baby still in her arms. The rest of the movie tracks Smiths efforts to protect the baby find out why he is endangered and eliminate the army of black-clad killers chasing them through an unnamed American city (actually its Toronto). Helping Smith is DQ (Monica Bellucci) a hooker whose specialty is lactating for diaper-clad clients and whose role in the film is wet-nursing the baby and falling in love with Smith. The supervillain of the piece is Mr. Hertz (a very funny Paul Giamatti) a gun lobbyist involved in a scheme to harvest bone marrow for a sick potentially vote-shifting U.S. senator. This plot detail goes by faster in the movie than it took me to type it. What you need to know is that the gunfights are nonstop inventive and deliriously audaciously entertaining. While making love to DQ in one scene Smith kills a half dozen intruders without losing his - or her - ardor. In another scene he takes on a batch of armed skydivers while in free fall. And theres more much more if you can afford it. Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Monica Bellucci is a prostitute who helps Mr. Smith protect a baby in the action film Shoot Em Up. Photo New Line Shoot Em Up 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Suppose you bought tickets for Shoot Em Up and didnt know what you were getting into. Maybe you never saw the poster; maybe the title wasnt a tip-off; maybe you were looking forward to a nice bland film about duck hunting. But within minutes of nestling yourself into a flame-retardant cushion youd know. In the very first scene Clive Owen stabs a guy through the head with a carrot. Splicch all the way through. He rescues a pregnant woman from murderous thugs then plays midwife while popping them off in a hail of gunfire (""Push -- bang pow -- Push""). And when the woman at last gives birth to a bouncing baby boy Owens character cuts the umbilical cord with a bullet. Splaatch blood on her face. At this point your choice is to get up and go or settle in for a twisted comic ride -- because those first splicch-splaatching minutes are just the beginning. Many many more people die from many many more gunshots dispatched under increasingly wacky circumstances. Visualize overkill. Visualize Owen shooting men in black leather while in coitus with Monica Bellucci. And this Owen in a parachute shooting men in black leather while plummeting to earth. James Bond has nothing on this guy. We never learn much about him other than his alias -- Mr. Smith -- and his violent annoyance with rude and distasteful people especially unrepentant coffee slurpers and jerks who park their Beemers in handicapped spots. We also learn that when he shoots he never misses unless his target is Paul Giamatti as the combed-over psycho-dweeb in charge of killing the pregnant woman and her baby. The woman dies at the start but the baby survives to get schlepped around an urban nightscape while Owen and Bellucci (as a lactating hooker) dodge every bullet in their path. Bad guys as Roger Ebert long ago observed almost always miss. Writer-director Michael Davis cheekily exploits this and every other pot-boiled stereotype just as he exploited various slasher road-flick cliches in 2003s Monster Man. It wasnt dreadful -- stupid and revolting yes but not without a certain sticky wit. Davis makes no bones about making B movies and theres no mistaking Shoot Em Up for anything else. It seems destined for cult status Some day I predict college students will belt out Owens deadpan one-liners (""Im a British nanny and Im dangerous"") at midnight screenings across the land. Like Quentin Tarantino without the aesthetic posturing the film is giddy with pop references (spaghetti Westerns Bugs Bunny Giamattis Sideways and John Woos balletic gunplay) and embraces the sloshy fun of exploitation genre-tweaking -- but it isnt art. It doesnt try to be art. If you accused it of being art Clive Owen would shoot your bloody head off. Theres barely an ounce of pretense in this mock-schlocky ode to ultraviolence even as its washed-out colors and gritty mise-en-scene recall that earlier Owen-as-au-pair movie Alfonso Cuarons fine Children of Men. Davis makes a few mistakes one of them with the plot He actually tries to invest it with politics. Hello? Maybe the message about gun control is meant to be ironic but I think it whooshed past my ear in a shoot-out. Also I could have done without the torture scene but then I always can. Even Giamatti and Owen cant make that funny -- whether were prepared for it or not. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Keter Manor 4x6-Foot Storage Shed for 339 + pickup at Walmart Fredericks of Hollywood Sale and Clearance Up to 77% off +...

Shoot em up Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2007) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shoot-em-up-2007,200,shoot'emup16,shoot'emup,rogerebert
"Hits and misses aplenty in clever and sleazy Shoot Em Up - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review Hits and misses aplenty in clever and sleazy Shoot Em Up Paul Giamatti (left) plays a hit man and Clive Owen is a mysterious stranger out to protect a motherless newborn in Michael Daviss over-the-top action movie. (james dittiger/new line cinema via ap) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 7 2007 The gleefully sleazy new action movie ""Shoot Em Up"" pits a mysterious Man With No Name against a sadistic hit man and Im guessing about three-quarters of the budget went to ammunition. Really though this is a battle of acting schools. In one corner we have Clive Owen as the glowering hero barely twitching a facial muscle while the bodies stack up like cordwood. In the other corner is Paul Giamatti as the deadly nerd villain chewing on the scenery as though it represented his first meal in months.Who wins? Its a genre piece so you can probably guess. In practice though ""Shoot Em Up"" is a disreputable but rakishly enjoyable Mexican standoff in which hambone and cold fish fight each other to a draw. Absolutely not for feminists lovers of period films and anyone whose sensibilities are bruised by over-the-top stuntwork its a cocktail made up of three parts testosterone to one part brains.Writer-director Michael Davis wastes no time gunning the engine into the red. We see a carrot-munching Owen waiting for a bus in a lousy section of town and then a terrified pregnant woman (Ramona Pringle) is running by him fleeing a mob of gunmen. The hero decides to intervene; within minutes two dozen men are lying in pools of blood. Only then do the opening credits roll.The woman gives birth then gets dead leaving Owens character - hes eventually called Mr. Smith but even thats a placeholder - in charge of the newborn. This is a gag in itself the sad-eyed killing machine as Mr. Mom shooting off an umbilical cord with a gun. Needing to feed the baby he does the obvious He finds a lactating hooker named DQ played by the Italian arthouse sexpot Monica Bellucci. Im not sure they cover this in ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting."" Maybe in the next edition.Leading the hordes of black-clad assassins is Mr. Hertz (Giamatti) a sarcastic middle-management type with serious anger issues. Hertz is always being interrupted mid-hit by his wife calling on the cellphone; there are a few har-de-har locker-room jokes about the old ball and chain that are funny once and then just dumb. In general ""Shoot Em Up"" is never quite as witty as it thinks it is at least when the characters open their mouths.When theyre shooting though - or leaping or driving or stabbing each other in the neck with carrots - its another matter entirely. Davis seems to have taken the film as a personal challenge to create action sequences that are faster higher crazier than any seen before. Mr. Smith doesnt share Bugs Bunnys taste in vegetables for nothing; a sizable chunk of the movies DNA comes straight from a Warner Brothers cartoon.For instance The baby lies on a playground merry-go-round with Smith several yards away when the killers appear; he uses bullets to get the kid spinning out of easy-target range. Later Smith blows away eight or so gunmen while simultaneously having sex with DQ. The film climaxes (if you will) with a shoot-out in free-fall thousands of feet above the earth; the scene plays like 3D chess with bullets.Why does everyone want the baby dead? Theres an explanation that involves a presidential candidate (Daniel Pilon) a fascist gun manufacturer (Stephen McHattie) bone marrow and surrogate mothers and if you buy any of that I know an online businessman in Nigeria who has a deal for you.No ""Shoot Em Up"" exists for its crunching ballet of flailing bodies and spinning cars for its ghoulish black humor and for its hopped-up boys-only party vibe. If the Maxim audience didnt already exist this movie would single-handedly invent it.By now you already know whether this is a movie you need to see or drive several miles out of your way to avoid. Even if youre in the latter camp its worth noting that Owen gives off fumes of class - he cant help it really - and Giamatti has a highly entertaining time slumming it. Filmmaker Davis isnt quite in the same league though at least not yet. ""Shoot Em Up"" is extremely clever without actually being smart. Its the Coen Brothers for Dummies.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

And hes right. For a good deal of its blood-soaked breakneck 87 minutes writer-director Michael Davis over-the-top action pic is fun. Borrowing by the bucketful from John Woo Quentin Tarantino and Chuck Jones Shoot Em Up offers nonstop fusillades ridiculously gruesome maiming and murders and the big joke of a mysterious hero whose weapon of choice is a carrot. At one point this blue-eyed Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) actually chomps down on one of his very firm very orange root vegetables and cracks ""Whats up Doc?"" And then Giamattis Mr. Hertz counters with a game ""Oh youre a wascally wabbit."" A hundred bodies may kerplunk to the ground necrophilia and back-alley sex-for-hire get tended to and the f-word ricochets around with the thwacking frequency of ammo fire but Shoot Em Up really is just Bugs Bunny vs. Elmer Fudd. Its an R-rated gravity-defying live-action cartoon. Davis whose previous titles include dabbles in stalker horror romantic comedy and even a kiddie flick orchestrates a propulsive series of action set-pieces. From the get-go things are wild a close-up of Owen looking worn and raggedy on a bus bench in the dead of night and then a woman runs by her stomach swollen clearly in labor. And then a guy with a gun comes after her. Owens Mr. Smith doesnt want to be bothered but he cant help himself. He goes down the alley extracts the woman from her predicament and then extracts the baby from the womb. All the while bullets from Giamatti and his gang fly. It takes a while to figure out why Hertz and his thugs want to exterminate the baby but Smith does. He drops by a brothel to see if his dark-haired dishy prostitute pal (Monica Belucci) will help him watch the newborn. And so this hooker with a thick Italian accent gets sucked into the mayhem. Of course theres time for a love scene but its a love scene and a shootout - Owen and Belucci go at it as a swarm of stunt guys break through windows and doors guns ablazing. Smith returns fire and returns to his lovemaking - simultaneously. Owen maintains a terse deadpan attitude throughout even as his character seethes with contempt at the fools and hypocrites of the world. (One rant about 40-year-old men who sport ponytails is priceless.) Giamatti acquits himself with villainous glee while the only thing lacking suppleness from Belucci is the awkward English of her line readings. Theres no point to all this really and Davis ""homages"" can be pretty shameless. (The movies central image - of a heroic gunman firing off rounds with one hand and sheltering a tiny infant with the other - is straight out of Woos Hong Kong action masterpiece Hard-Boiled.) But for sheer audacity and adrenaline-fueled carnage Shoot Em Up hits its target pretty much dead on. Shoot Em Up  (out of four stars) Written and directed by Michael Davis.

"The dreadful ""movie"" Shoot Em Up. Slate Sign In Sign Up The dreadful ""movie"" Shoot Em Up. The dreadful ""movie"" Shoot Em Up. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 7 2007 345 PM Lactating Hookers And other low points of Shoot Em Up. By Dana Stevens Clive Owen in Shoot Em Up I know Im typing myself as hopelessly unhip by not rolling with the amoral ""fun"" of Shoot Em Up (New Line) a grubby little action spoof with a thrown-together script a mystifyingly top-notch cast and a body count to rival the war in Afghanistan. After all its not meant to be taken seriously Its a parody of sadism-as-entertainment not an example of it I get it that as soon as graphic novels or video games are invoked as references in a movie were all supposed to chuckle indulgently at the content. But I refuse to relinquish my right to be repelled by this nasty piece of work. Not least among Shoot Em Ups aesthetic crimes is its barefaced (not to mention tediously redundant) larceny from a truly great work of popular art Warner Bros. cartoons. Our nihilistic hero Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) is munching on a carrot Bugs Bunny-style when a pregnant woman rushes by pursued by an armed man. During the ensuing gun battle Mr. Smith manages to kill a man using only a carrot deliver the baby sever the umbilical cord with a bullet and carry the woman and child to safety. But the mother is killed by a member of the assassins gang leaving Smith responsible for the newborn. Thats where your lactating hooker comes in. Advertisement Donna Quintana a bizarre concoction of a character played (or should I say phonetically sounded out) by Monica Bellucci spends her days in a specialty brothel suckling middle-aged pervs (how her milk came in at all will be explained later in some maudlin downtime between gunfights). Shes conscripted as a wet nurse for the infant whom they name Oliver after Oliver Twist. But like that orphan the poor lads troubles are far from over. As it turns out a crazed gangster/businessman named Hertz (Paul Giamatti) is bent on killing the baby in order to protect the secret of a dying U.S. senator whos breeding babies for a last-ditch marrow transplant. These goings-on are intimately yet incoherently connected with the gun lobby thus allowing Mr. Smith the unique opportunity to advocate for gun control between pauses to reload. Believe it or not that plot sounded better on paper than it reads on the screen. If all of this nonsense was played as a genre pastiche--like the Airplane movies say or last years delightful Hot Fuzz--Shoot Em Up might have been lighthearted in tone. Instead Michael Davis who seems to have scribbled the dialogue with one hand while operating a gaming joystick with the other hides behind some vague notion of camp as a pretext to imagine awful things happening to peoples bodies. Innumerable (and indistinguishable) baddies are eviscerated tortured thrown out of planes and impaled on root vegetables--but hey its all in the name of protecting a baby. The way the infants helplessness is milked indiscriminately for tears laughs or thrills according to the plots demands is another of the movies moral low points. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Clive Owen is making a career of delivering newborns and smuggling them to safety against impossible odds--he performed the same office in last years sublime Children of Men a work so profoundly divergent from Shoot Em Up that it seems misleading to call them both ""movies."" Owen Giamatti and Bellucci--all fine actors at the peak of hireability--must have been coming off a collective coke bender when they agreed to be in this murky straight-to-video-looking piece of crud (which gets extra points off for doing the lamest job ever of trying to pass off Toronto as New York. Why not just set the movie in Canada and be done with it?). Davis has cited John Woos cult classic Hardboiled (in which Chow Yun-Fat rescues a baby in the midst of a gunfight) as an influence proving once again that watching cool movies is a less-than-sufficient apprenticeship for making cool movies. He would have done well to recruit script doctors from the participants in Slates recent action-movie one-liner contest who might have stepped in to prevent some of the worst pre- and post-gunshot wisecracks in recent memory ""He who leads from the rear takes it in the rear""; ""Guns dont kill people ... but they sure help""; and perhaps most painfully for the Chuck Jones fans among us ""Whats up doc?""

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shoot-em-up ) Shoot Em Up (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Ever since people saw him in a tuxedo in Croupier Clive Owen was considered the likely successor to Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. It remains unclear whether the producers passed over Owen in favor of the lesser known Daniel Craig or whether (as some reports indicate) Owen turned down the opportunity to play the superspy preferring not to have the baggage along with the paycheck. Whatever the case Shoot Em Up provides an opportunity to glimpse what might have been. While Owen does not play a character with any zeroes in his moniker he does a lot of the same kind of stunts that are expected from any self-respecting 007. Of course though his moves might be pure Bond his manner and appearance are not. No martinis (shaken or stirred) no chic gadgets no cool cars and no impeccable threads. Just two-day stubble and clothing that hasnt been washed in a week. Then again if your leading lady is Monica Bellucci do you really need anything more? There arent many Bond girls who can hold a candle to her. Theres a little bit of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in Shoot Em Up although this production isnt as smart or as slick. Shoot Em Up is one huge send-up of the action genre and pretty much consists of shoot-outs and chases overtaking each other like waves rolling onto a beach each more over-the-top than its predecessor. Everything is played for laughs and the body count easily hits the triple digits although its tough to keep track accurately. Its all carnage and mayhem all the time. One scene gives new meaning to the term ""coitus interruptus"" and theres a strong argument that when Clive Owen is in a nearby car its best to use your turn signal. When it comes to road rage this guys pretty intense. Owen plays a bum who goes by the name of Mr. Smith. Hes a most extraordinary bum because he seems to be a hybrid of Bond and Superman. An act of foolish gallantry gets him into trouble he tries to save a pregnant woman from assassination. She gives birth then gets hit in the head with a stray bullet. This leaves Mr. Smith with a baby to care for - a baby whose life is wanted by Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti) for reasons yet to be revealed. Needing help with the infant Mr. Smith turns to the only woman he knows a lactating prostitute (Bellucci) who initially rebuffs him until she has a heart-to-heart chat with Mr. Hertz. Pretty soon its this version of Mr. and Mrs. Smith (plus baby) on the run from about six dozen hitmen and a score (or so) of highly trained government agents. They shoulda brought more guys. When it comes to truth in advertising Shoot Em Up delivers. You want gunfights you get gunfights - big wild and crazy. The problem with the film is that its a one joke concept. Even at a slim 85 minutes it wears out its welcome. The first half hour is great fun. The second half-hour is okay. Past the hour mark however exhaustion - the stepchild of repetition - sets in. Plus there are a couple of graphic torture sequences that cast a pall over the proceedings rather than adding to the general sense of gleeful havoc. Then again director Michael Davis is all about breaking down barriers here so he likely relishes the jolt of discomfort these scenes will provide just like he probably doesnt care that elements of his audience will have trouble with the extremes he goes to regarding the ""baby in peril."" (Interesting that this is the second movie in which Owen has been stuck protecting a baby - not that there are any other similarities to Children of Men.) Hard-core action fans will enjoy what the film has to offer even if it runs 50% longer than it needs to. There isnt a credible moment in the entire enterprise and thats intentional. Any review that uses the terms ""preposterous"" or ""unrealistic"" in a pejorative sense has missed the point. I like Shoot Em Ups audacity and its willingness to push the envelope beyond the limits of good taste. In the end its a little too long and uneven to recommend outright but I wont deny having enjoyed aspects of what Davis is offering. Drinking the full adrenaline-with-a-wink cocktail might be too much but theres nothing wrong with sampling it.

He fires them two at a time leaping across rooms -- blam blam blam -- in glorious slow motion. He fires them in the middle of the sky after plunging out of a plane without a parachute. He blasts away at an overly coiffed hairdo (""That ponytail doesnt make you look young hip or cool"") at an umbilical cord that needs severing at a team of assassins who burst into the room where hes making love -- an activity he keeps on doing the entire time that hes shooting. Smith in other words does exactly what youd expect the hero of a bloody trashy volcanically depraved action movie to do. He just does it a little bit...more so and thats the rollicking good joke of Shoot Em Up which has the inspiration to send up over-the-top action movies from Tango amp; Cash to Die Hard by nudging their slam-bang kinetic overkill right to the breaking point -- but not past it. Michael Davis the writer-director of Shoot Em Up recognizes that the action genre long ago devolved into knowing self-parody. The signature taglines the nonchalant perfection of the heroes bullet-blasting moxie -- all of this is so stylized its already a joke. Clive Owen plays Smith as the classic megaplex loner-nihilist a Bogart-meets-Bruce Willis with a heart of gold and he does it absolutely straight which is really the ultimate wink. Smiths ""lovable"" trademark is chewing on carrots like a film-noir Bugs Bunny. (He also uses them as weapons.) He teams up with a hooker (Monica Bellucci) who helps him to save an orphaned infant -- a nod to John Woos great Hard-Boiled. Paul Giamatti as the villain has just the right feral sadistic sweatiness and he does great exasperated takes on the words ""God damn it"" Shoot Em Up isnt out to be the Airplane of ballistic blowouts (e.g. National Lampoons Loaded Weapon 1). In two scenes out of three it could just about pass for the thing its satirizing. But then its pulpy violent excess will tip over...into slightly more excessive excess. Thats its silly scuzzball joy.

Director Michael Davis makes the transition from straight-to-DVD stinkers to the bigscreen in conspicuous fashion with an action movie that is violent and vile in equal measure. When hitman Paul Giamatti is dispatched to assassinate a pregnant woman not-so-innocent bystander Clive Owen intervenes on the babys behalf unleashing a firefight of epic proportions. Good taste is the first fatality in this gonzo thrill-seeker sure to offend mainstream dispositions yet too stylistically audacious to dismiss outright. Like ""Running Scared"" and ""Boondock Saints"" before it shamelessly sordid pic which opens Sept. 7 will likely fall short theatrically but find its audience on DVD. As Mr. Smith (Owen) is minding his own business a car comes careening around the corner in pursuit of a pregnant woman. Smith pulls a carrot from his trenchcoat and takes a hearty bite a gesture meant to set the tone for the cartoonishly over-the-top action sequences to come. A better indicator comes moments later when Smith drives the carrot through the would-be assassins skull or shortly thereafter as he delivers the womans baby amid heavy crossfire severing the umbilical cord with a well-aimed bullet. Smith survives the opening action scene -- a jaw-dropping ordeal for both its ingenuity and sheer tactlessness -- but the anonymous woman isnt so lucky leaving Smith in charge of the orphaned infant. Luckily he just so happens to know a lactating hooker DQ (Monica Bellucci as a Madonna-whore hybrid) who with understandable reluctance agrees to assume the mothers role in this dysfunctional family. After a little snooping the couple uncovers a convoluted plot by which an ailing presidential candidate (Daniel Pilon) plans to harvest bone marrow from surrogate babies (typical of Davis sense of humor the artificially inseminated mothers provide the off-color pun of the movies title). Giamatti is in gruffly manic mode as Hertz a short-tempered assassin with no more luck than Elmer Fudd in capturing his prey but a nearly inexhaustible supply of henchmen to assist the cause. Hertz sets one trap after another to ensnare Smith and kill the child thwarted at every turn by clever tricks that would make even John Woo jealous. Smiths backstory is never revealed but its clear the character is no stranger to heavy artillery and ordnance with a MacGyver-like skill for devising impromptu Rube Goldberg contraptions. Owens rugged persona lends itself to the hard-boiled hero. (Could any other actor make eating carrots look cool? In this film-noir world the vegetable supplants cigarettes while conveniently doubling as a deadly weapon.) And though Owen claims he was never offered the role of James Bond Davis action-movie homage revels in those details sidelined in ""Casino Royale"" -- namely groan-inducing one-liners and degrading sexual shenanigans. The directors inspiration was Chow Yun-Fats baby-saving scene in ""Hard Boiled"" and Davis elaborately choreographed set pieces demonstrate no shortage of invention. Still its hard to appreciate the action without thinking of the baby tucked under Owens arm like some kind of football in peril at all times. The films gentlest scene features the helpless child stashed in a grimy bathtub for lack of a bassinet watching wide-eyed as Smith demonstrates the different parts of his pistol. Moved by this display of tenderness DQ promptly seduces him but their sexual romp is interrupted by the arrival of Hertzs goons. And so it is that ""Shoot Em Up"" features all stages of life -- intercourse birth and death (but mostly death) -- meted out amid elaborate gun battles. At one point Smith and DQ discover the baby doesnt cry in the presence of heavy metal -- which makes up the majority of the films soundtrack lending a gnarly energy to the whole affair. Nor does it seem to mind heavy gunfire which is just as well since the child has known little else in its short life. Somewhere in all this lies a statement about gun control a mixed message if ever there was one and New Line shouldnt be surprised to find this pic in the sights of concerned parents. Though it belongs to the same questionable new category of exploitation film as ""Smokin Aces"" and ""Domino"" theres nothing to say Davis audacious style wouldnt function equally well with less offensive material. One can only imagine how his energetic talents might have redeemed ""The Pacifier."" Shoot Em UpProductionA New Line Cinema release of a Montford/Murphy production.
