In August Lily finds stability and strength. And in Lily Fanning - as watchful and still as the young Leonardo Di Caprio - has a role that reveals her acting depths.August presides over an apiary that produces ""Black Madonna"" honey. And in this cinematic pieta more vinegary than sweet she brings the bruised and broken Lily back to productive life.The film is set in the rural South in 1964 when relations between black and white can be most uncivil even though President Johnson has signed the Civil Rights Act. A violent encounter with her father sends Lily and the family housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) looking for a safe harbor. But when they leave the family peach farm Rosaleen who is black and wants to register to vote is roughed up and arrested by bigots. Lily liberates her.Lily treasures a memento of her mother an image of a black Madonna and child that leads her to the Boatwrights Victorian a peaceful island in a stormy sea of racial and gender inequality.Gaily painted Pepto-Bismol pink the Boatwright sanctuary is home to August and her sisters June and May likewise named for the months of their birth but otherwise unlike their earth mama sister ever accepting and cheerful. Fierce June (Alicia Keys) is the thinker a musician and NAACP activist disapproving of Augusts past work as a Mammy. Emotional May (Sophie Okonedo) is the empath who feels - and frees - the pain of others. In the Boatwright hive the three sisters show Lily and Rosaleen different ways of how to thrive.Prince-Bythewood whose prior feature was the wonderful Love and Basketball has empathy for her characters even Lilys violent father T Ray (Paul Bettany scary good). Though her material skirts the cliche of the ""magic Negro"" that mystical black who helps a Caucasian become more spiritual Prince-Bythewood shows the difference between a black matriarch as a Mammy and a black woman as a mother figure.Though the filmmaker relies a little too heavily on 60s pop and Ramp;B tunes to set the tone her visual rhythms are original and get the most out of an ensemble that includes Nate Parker (The Great Debaters) as Neil Junes swain.Rogier Stoffers the gifted Dutch cinematographer who shot Mongol beautifully captures the lush rock-dotted landscape (North Carolina doubling for South) without making it look picture postcard-y.The filmmakers give Latifah and Fanning room to create characters that breathe in the sweet smell of clover and breathe out the contented sigh of independence.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 18 2008 Save for later Saved Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox About video ads View Caption of The honey runs thick in ""The Secret Life of Bees"" and so does the treacle. The cloying dullness sets in early although not from the first frame which begins with a girls voice-over narration telling us ""I killed my mother when I was 4 years old."" This sounds like something Mickey Spillane might have cooked up.In fact the movie written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood is derived from a popular 2002 novel by Sue Monk Kidd which is mostly set in South Carolina shortly after the passage of the Civil Rights Act. This setting allows the movies talented but underutilized cast to try out their Deep South accents while sashaying wriggling cooing and weeping.Dakota Fanning is Lily who accidentally shot her mother and now years later is stuck in a physically abusive relationship with her father (Paul Bettany) from whom she flees with the family housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) into the warm embrace of beekeeper August Boatwright (Queen Latifah) and Augusts sisters May (Sophie Okonedo) and June (Alicia Keys). (What happened to July?) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The secret haven August provides far away from Lilys father is a ramshackle home painted the color of - as one character says - Pepto-Bismol. But all is not well in paradise. Weepy May is emotionally unstable; June who plays a mean cello and is all too clearly supposed to represent the fiery new civil rights generation is having boyfriend issues. In the midst of it all is August with her voluminous benevolence. Shes such an idealized matriarch that even Queen Latifahs prodigious gift for down-home humor cant quite humanize her. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Among the cast Hudson is the most neglected. Although she has ample screen time in the early going and is very fine she practically disappears from view once the scene shifts to bee country. Since the relationship between Lily and Rosaleen with its echoes of Carson McCullers and Harper Lee is the most resonant in the film it seems grossly negligent to skimp on it in favor of the ensuing melodramatics.Fanning thankfully is growing out of her grating adorableness phase. She is now poised to embark on a journey far more treacherous than Lilys in ""The Secret Life of Bees."" I am speaking of the move from girlhood to young adulthood a passage that has capsized the careers of so many child actors. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for thematic material and some violence.)

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 17 2008 338 PM The Secret Life of Bees Just sweet enough. By Dana Stevens Dakota Fanning and Queen Latifah in The Secret Life of Bees I resisted seeing The Secret Life of Bees (Fox Searchlight) at first on the grounds that theres nothing harder to write about than synthetic treacle. But the movie directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood from a best-selling novel by Sue Monk Kidd is something far rarer Its authentic treacle. Or rather as long as were using the metaphor of a sticky sweetener here authentic honey like the high-quality product harvested by the movies trio of beekeeping sisters. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Slate V The critical response to movies opening this weekend. Advertisement If the phrase ""trio of beekeeping sisters"" has already set off your gag reflex you can stop right here. This movie is exactly as sentimental as it sounds on paper and it wont convert anyone from cynic to romantic. But if you have a high tolerance for mass-market uplift--if youve ever sniffled your way through a long-distance commercial or been legitimately inspired by a corny platitude--The Secret Life of Bees will do very nicely. Its hard to roll your eyes when theyre full of tears. The film begins in 1964 as Lyndon Johnson has just signed the Civil Rights Act into law. Dakota Fanning plays Lily Owens a 14-year-old growing up in South Carolina with her abusive father T. Ray (Paul Bettany) and devoted housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson). After Rosaleen is beaten by racist thugs on her way to register to vote she and Lily escape together to a town called Tiburon where Lily has reason to believe she can learn the truth about her long-dead mother. Theyre taken in by the aforementioned beekeeping sisters serene matriarch August (Queen Latifah) nascent activist June (Alicia Keys) and tenderhearted but simple May (Sophie Okonedo). Are you still with me or have I lost another contingent with the words serene matriarch and tenderhearted but simple? Monitor your insulin because theres more to come including a wholesome romance between Lily and a shy teenager who helps out with the beehives (Tristan Wilds half a world away from the Baltimore gangbanger he played in The Wire). But Ill still defend this movie against all comers if only because of the crackerjack chemistry of its ensemble cast. Fanning who suddenly looks startlingly like the teenage Jodie Foster may also manage to match Fosters longevity on-screen; shes left her moppet self behind without a second glance. Hudson as the long-underestimated Rosaleen telegraphs her characters years of tamped-down resentment with the dry wit of the great Hattie McDaniel. Then there are the sisters. Alicia Keys in addition to being a fine songwriter and one of the best-looking human beings alive can really act. I believed completely in her June Boatwright a woman so stubbornly independent she cant admit she needs anything or anyone. British stage actress Sophie Okonedo takes what could have been a deadly role--a holy-fool type not far from Tropic Thunders dreaded ""full retard""--and invests her with physical specificity and a complex inner life. Queen Latifah basically just radiates her usual Latifian air of confidence and reassuring warmth but thats enough. I want her to come over to my house conduct a motivational seminar and then help me winnow down my wardrobe. As a document of Southern race relations in the early 60s The Secret Life of Bees is about as useful as The Fairy Chronicles. Its multiple conflicts are all resolved too patly and its dream of a black female utopia could be read as a version of the ""magic Negro"" narrative. (Mistakenly I think; unlike say the noble African neighbor of In America these women have complex motivations and real flaws and the black characters on-screen far outnumber the white.) But if you approach the film as young-adult fare (though neither it nor the book its based on were marketed as such) its gentle virtues start to shine through. Bees doesnt want to be topical or edgy or explicitly didactic; its a well-kept beehive of a movie warm sweet and buzzing with life.

(It wasnt though it did make Good Morning Americas reading list.) The 2002 novel is a coming-of-age story about a white girl Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) who flees her abusive father and in the company of her black nanny Rosaleen finds refuge and surrogate motherhood with three Afro-angelic sisters who run a bee farm. Why did Kidd a white woman choose these heroines? ""I grew up surrounded by black women"" she told one interviewer. ""I feel they are like hidden royalty dwelling among us."" So Bees is another entry in the long tradition of books and movies about whites being nurtured and schooled by the example of the black underling. (Youve heard of Huckleberry Finn? Gone With the Wind?) The novel is set in rural South Carolina in 1964 which is just about the time it would have automatically been turned into an Oscar-nominated movie. The obvious reference point is To Kill a Mockingbird whose girl narrator Scout Finch is 6 to Lilys 14 and whose fictional setting is Maycomb Ala. instead of Bees Tiburon S.C. But that was back when most big films tended to serious sentiment. Today the dominant tone is irreverence sarcasm facetiousness. Can a time-capsule movie like this one have any resonance today? Can it find an audience to nurture in the old noble now-discredited Hollywood traditions? I hope so because adapter-director Gina Prince-Bythewood has made an honorable movie wonderfully attentive to the skills of its excellent cast that turned this devout cynic into a believer. ""I killed my mother when I was four years old"" Lily says at the beginning of the film. ""Thats all I know about myself."" For the past 10 years she has been raised by -- been the prisoner of -- her father T. Ray (Paul Bettany) who runs a peach farm. Lily is dreamy wistful self-hating and suicidal; T. Ray is a sullen beast punishing the girl by making her kneel on grits (coarse-ground corn meal to those of you -- those of me -- who are ignorant of Southern cuisine). Lily has her own roiling karma. No question she is bad luck for the people she loves. Two of them die violently two more are attacked by racist whites. Lily wants to die too; and when she runs away and discovers the Caribbean-pink house of the three Boatwright sisters its as if shes died and gone to heaven. August (Queen Latifah) who runs the bee farm is the matriarch of the clan beaming wisdom and common sense to a child voracious for any human touch. May (Brit actress Sophie Okonedo) has long been in mourning for her dead twin sister April. Her emotions are deep and constantly near the surface; she is given to weeping and keening when she sees the pain of others. June (Alicia Keys) a teacher is the no-nonsense one. With her high forehead Afro coiffure and commanding hauteur she is a preview of militant black women like Kathleen Cleaver and Angela Davis -- and the least maternal of the Boatwright brood. The film is full of sweet subtle touches. In the book Lily daydreams of meeting her mother Deborah in heaven; and after 10000 years telling Lily she was not to blame for her death Deborah would spend the next 10000 fixing the girls ratty hair. (""She would brush it into such a tower of beauty people all over heaven would drop their harps just to admire it."") The movie doesnt make a big declamatory deal of this but after a few days with the Boatwrights Lily looks magically presentable pretty -- because for once shes been cared for.

ABOUT THE MOVIE The Secret Life of Bees  1/2 (out of four)Stars Queen Latifah Dakota Fanning Jennifer Hudson Sophie Okonedo Alicia Keys Paul BettanyDirector Gina Prince-BythewoodDistributor Fox Searchlight PicturesRating PG-13 for thematic material and some violenceRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY A sweetly inspiring movie is a tough thing to pull off. At any moment it can veer into cloyingly sappy territory. The Secret Life of Bees walks that sticky line rather adeptly never getting too sentimental though it comes dangerously close and has its predictable aspects. Based on the popular spiritually tinged novel by Sue Monk Kidd the movie version is less treacly and more straightforward than the book. As directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love amp; Basketball) it becomes a tale of personal exploration the search for love and family. Its setting North Carolina in the early 1960s heightens its languorous mood even as it touches on the racial tensions of the time. STORY Sisterly bond is no secret for Bees co-stars CLIP Get inside the hive of The Secret Life of Bees Dakota Fanning is maturing into a fine young actress and she is just right as Lily Owens a girl being raised by an angry father (Paul Bettany). After her black caregiver Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) is taunted and beaten Lily flees taking Rosaleen with her. Obsessed with learning more about her late mother Lily has pieced together clues that lead her to the home of August Boatwright (Queen Latifah) and her two sisters May (Sophie Okonedo) and June (Alicia Keys). August keeps bees and has a profitable honey-making operation that entrances Lily. She also forges a friendship with Zach Taylor (Tristan Wilds) Augusts teenage godson who has dreams of becoming a lawyer. The films dialogue faithful to the book tries too hard to be prophetic and folksy. Its hard to imagine a 14-year-old thinking or talking the way budding writer Lily does in the narration ""(The bees) showed up like the angel Gabriel appearing to the Virgin Mary. I know its forward to compare my small life to hers but I have good reason to believe she wouldnt mind."" The ensemble cast is the films strongest asset. It shouldnt need remarking upon but since the civil rights movement is key to the story The Secret Life of Bees is noteworthy for featuring so many African-American women as strong and multidimensional characters. The Secret Life of Bees is hampered by over-earnestness and tugs too intently at the heartstrings. But those who were moved by the book are likely to find this adaptation affecting and emotionally satisfying.

Characters deliver high-toned aphoristic speeches and the interior of the big pink house where the Boatwright sisters live becomes a platform for scenes that often feel staged like a play.By Susan WalkerENTERTAINMENT REPORTERFri. Oct. 17 2008 Starring Dakota Fanning Jennifer Hudson and Queen Latifah. Written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood based on the novel by Sue Monk Kidd. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14A   The Secret Life of Bees comes to the screen trailing its literary origins. Characters deliver high-toned aphoristic speeches and the interior of the big pink house where the Boatwright sisters live becomes a platform for scenes that often feel staged like a play.Article Continued BelowSo its a good thing that director Gina Prince-Bythewood got herself some women who can really act. Dakota Fanning has a job to do amidst this pageant of broken hearts broken heads and racial hatred during the Civil Rights era to keep the audience focused on Lily and the burden of guilt and sense of abandonment she carries.Because of her outstanding performance Bees avoids becoming just another feel-good movie. Lilys awful secret is revealed in an opening flashback her earliest memory coincides with her mothers death. But what really hurts is the knowledge impressed upon her by her father T. Ray (Paul Bettany) that her mother abandoned her before she died.Now 14 Lily knows kindness only from the black housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson). The pair heads for Tiburon where Lily knows her mother once went because its written on the back of a picture of a black Madonna. That picture leads them to the African-American Boatwright sisters. August Boatwright (Queen Latifah) runs the honey business which she initiates Lily into; June (Alicia Keys) is a cellist and schoolteacher; and May (Sophie Okonedo) a gentle soul in permanent mourning for her twin sister. Lily blames her own presence for the bad things that start to occur after she arrives. ""My whole lifes been nothing but a hole where my mother should have been"" she says.Juggling history literary intentions profound emotions and some larger-than-life characters Prince-Bythewoods movie nearly sinks under sadness. Quite a bit of honey is applied to make the awful truths palatable but The Secret Life of Bees curtails the sappiness with performances - especially Fannings - that are grounded in reality.Read Susan Walkers interview with Jennifer Hudson in tomorrows Star.

Queen Latifah and Dakota Fanning in Secret Life of Bees. Photo Sidney Baldwin Movie review Secret Life of Bees is so sweet 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Secret Life of Bees Family drama. Starring Queen Latifah Dakota Fanning Jennifer Hudson Alicia Keys Sophie Okonedo and Paul Bettany. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Once upon a time in a small South Carolina town there lived a warmhearted beekeeper who made honey so sweet and delectable that people came from all around to stock up. Her name was August and her honey-making sisters were May and June. ""The Secret Life of Bees"" doesnt actually begin this way but it might as well. Suffused with a golden glow the movie looks and sounds like a fairy tale. It stays faithful to Sue Monk Kidds popular novel in which the lives of a black family and a white one (not to mention a swarm of bees) play out against the backdrop of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. As in a fairy tale bad things as well as good happen to its 14-year-old heroine Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) In the opening scene a gun goes off and her mother drops to the floor dead. Brought up by an abusive father (Paul Bettany) whom she calls T. Ray not being able to bring herself to say Daddy her sole protector is the family housekeeper Rosaleen (Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson). The story is set in motion when Rosaleen defiantly attempts to register to vote. After all President Lyndon Johnson has just told her on TV that its her right. When she is beaten up Lily decides its time for both of them to flee. The runaways feel a magical pull to a big pink house headquarters of a thriving honey company featuring on its label a biblical Mary with black skin. Lily has an affection for bees inherited from her mother and when she sees these jars they resonate with something deep inside her. A half hour into the movie audiences are asked to take a leap of faith. August Boatwright the queen bee of the bee operation saunters into the living room with its magenta fabric walls. Queen Latifah plays her with a regal bearing and an outpouring of love. August hears Rosaleen and Lilys plight exaggerated by the youngster and decides that the two will stay against the objections of her uptight sister June (Alicia Keys who could use another gesture besides a scowl to show shes upset). Director Gina Prince-Bythewood (""Love amp; Basketball"") uses many lovely scenes to capture the idyll these newcomers are welcomed into. In one scene August takes Lily to the honey house and under a veiled hat teaches her the intricacies of beekeeping. In another Lily and the emotionally fragile third Boatwright sister May (Sophie Okonedo) cool down from the Southern heat with a hose and proceed to get everybody else wet leaving them on the grass laughing. Of course it cant last. The rest of the world is sure to intrude on this peaceful existence. And it does in ways that show that you cant legislate people to overcome their ingrained prejudices. Fanning becomes more accomplished as she gets older. She holds her own as an actress with Bettany whose stark and chilling portrayal of Lilys mean father makes you think underage kids running away is a good idea and with Queen Latifah who emanates sweetness without it ever coming across as false. With her pained expressions and difficulty in talking Okonedo an Oscar nominee for ""Hotel Rwanda"" lets you see inside Mays troubled soul. At times ""The Secret Life of Bees"" borders on sticky sweet. But Prince-Bythewood makes you care about the characters and hope they live happily ever after.

While its by no means as dire as Dakotas last such effort the despicable melodrama ""Hounddog"" its surprising that a promising African-American director like Gina Prince-Bythewood (""Love amp; Basketball"") would choose a story in which the black characters exist primarily to help the white protagonist. Instead of coping with a rape as in ""Hounddog"" Fannings character Lily as a 4-year-old accidentally shot her mother to death. Again shes provided with an abusive father (Paul Bettany) from whom she flees as soon as she turns 14 in 1964 North Carolina. Taking along her housekeeper Rosaleen (Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson of ""Dreamgirls"") after an ugly racial incident they seek refuge at the pink home of three beekeeping sisters. The oldest the wise aphorism-spouting August (Queen Latifah) runs the thriving honey business; June (Alicia Keys) is a civil rights activist initially resistant to Lilys charms; and May (Sophie Okonedo of ""Hotel Rwanda"") is a little slow and inevitably headed for a tragic ending. Price-Bythewood has encouraged fairly broad performances from these formidable actresses for characters who arent terribly well developed in her script which is based on a best seller by Sue Monk Kidd. In the end this schmaltzfest is all about Lily and her attempts to connect with her long-dead mother. ""The Secret Life of Bees"" showcases Fanning who is growing into an impressive teenage actress - even if a scene where she licks honey off an older boys finger is well creeptastic. THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES Sticky as honey. Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 (child abuse racial violence). At the Harlem USA the East 19th Street the East 86th Street others.

Fortunately the cast cuts through a cloying script and boosts unsure direction with sharply focused performances. Dakota Fanning plays Lily Owens the 14-year-old daughter of abusive T. Ray Owens (Paul Bettany). Having lost her mother to violence Lily has only her housekeeper Rosaleen Daise (Jennifer Hudson) for friendship. This being 1964 South Carolina however Rosaleen has her own troubles which escalate when she challenges a local racist. RELATED BUZZWORTHY BEE MOVIES Soon the two are on the run looking for both physical and emotional shelter. They find it in the home of the beekeeping Boatwright sisters who sell honey throughout the South. The eldest August (Queen Latifah) is kind and practical while May (Sophie Okonedo) is loving but emotionally disturbed. Only the ever-suspicious June (Alicia Keys) is unwelcoming. Despite Junes hesitation Lily and Rosaleen are allowed to stay in this unlikely haven. Each finds some kind of peace despite an awareness of the ugliness awaiting in the outside world. Prince-Bythewood creates a warm environment but not a realistic one. Period details stand out when they should blend in and the plot threads are woven together too carefully. More problematic is the directors evident discomfort with the heavy themes shes forced to confront. Fanning is sexualized in decidedly uneasy ways while many of the black characters come across as regrettably underwritten. On the other hand nearly all of these fine actresses are able to rise above the movies troubles. Okonedo is stuck with the sort of thankless only-in-the-movies role that does her no favors. But Latifah brings her usual calm authority and an elegant Keys is imperious without being off-putting. As for Fanning she continues to prove herself a natural who can handle anything thrown her way. Its worth wondering though if she should have to. ""Bees"" is certainly a step up from her last film the odious ""Hounddog"" which tackled sexual and racial issues in a far more disturbing manner. Still while her co-stars are old enough to make their own choices perhaps somebody should consider choosing projects a little more carefully on her behalf. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Adapting novelist Sue Monk Kidds acclaimed coming-of-age novel screenwriter-director Gina Prince-Bythewood evokes a turbulent moment in the life of a girl and in the history of our nation. The time is 1964 the ink on the Civil Rights Act barely dry and the letter of the law ignored by racists in Jim Crow South Carolina. Fourteen-year-old Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) and her harsh father T. Ray (Paul Bettany) have shared a combative relationship in the decade since her mother was killed. Lilys steadiest source of care is Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) a kind stubborn housekeeper who acts as a substitute mother and best friend. When T. Rays belligerence erupts Lily and Rosaleen leave home setting out for nearby Tiburon where Lilys few keepsakes of her mother suggest shell find answers about day her mother died. What they find is much greater than they expected. Theyre taken in by the Boatwright sisters who live in a Pepto-Bismol pink home and operate the finest apiary in the region. Over the course of a summer the girl learns the role the Boatwrights played in her life years earlier. The sisters are a formidable team. August (Queen Latifah) is the matriarch guiding the household affairs with a sure steady hand. June (Alicia Keys) is aloof and politically engaged a Black Power activist wary of the white teenager. Childlike emotionally fragile May (Sophie Okonedo) accepts the newcomers immediately. The affection and friction between such temperamentally distinct siblings is an eye-opener for Lily who is convinced that she is unlovable. August teaches Lily to tend the beehives with the love that every living thing requires and gradually shares secrets about her late mothers past helping Lily take the next step to maturity. Its not all milk and honey however. Lily develops a crush on a cute African-American boy and their first date at a movie theater teaches them a painful and frightening lesson about intolerance. Shaken and saddened but wiser Lily is ready to take the next step on her journey to adulthood. The mentoring is handled with unforced homespun wisdom. Fanning gives a strong assured performance as Lily who is as self-absorbed and petulant as she is good-hearted and brave. There are moments when her emotions seem forced but anyone who has seen a 14-year-old girl in the midst of a tearful meltdown will recognize that element of overacting in real life too. Shes evolved by the finale toughened but still tenderhearted. Hudson whose acting has been stilted in ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Sex and the City"" takes an impressive leap forward giving us a proud but underpriveleged woman determined to fulfill her potential. In fact theres hardly a performance onscreen that isnt transfixing. Plan your weekend around this one. THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic material and some violence.

"The Secret Life of Bees (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Secret Life of Bees (PG-13)  All sugar -- and very little spice. Dakota Fanning and Queen Latifah are shown in a scene from ""The Secret Life of Bees."" Photo AP/Fox Searchlight Pictures Sidney Baldwin. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald The kind of movie so heartfelt and earnest it makes you feel like a grouch for not surrendering to it The Secret Life of Bees emotes mightily but says precious little. Theres something too perfect and precious about writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewoods adaptation of Sue Monk Kidds bestseller about a 14-year-old girl named Lily (Dakota Fanning) who flees her abusive father (Paul Bettany) in 1964 South Carolina. Lily and another girl her former caretaker Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) take refuge in the home of the Boatwright sisters who harvest bees on their farm and run a successful honey business. August (Queen Latifah) the eldest immediately takes a motherly interest in the runaways. June (Alicia Keys) the middle sister treats them resentfully. May (Sophie Okonedo) the youngest is happy for the added company. Life lessons quickly come to all involved some having to do with the just-signed Civil Rights Act which has only managed to agitate rednecks to more vicious acts of racism. Lily befriends a black teen (The Wires Lincoln Taylor) and their budding wholly innocent romance proves problematic for the locals. Rosaleen blossoms into a young woman. The contrarian June makes life difficult for her boyfriend (Nate Parker). Mays eccentric overly sensitive personality is the source of tragedy. And August pours the wisdom and Hallmark-card insights over everybody. The Secret Life of Bees is beautifully shot by Rogier Stoffers (who also shot the Genghis Khan epic Mongol) and the performances are all fine. Especially good is Keys who continues to prove herself a surprisingly strong actress and who the camera cannot get enough of. But this is woefully familiar material and Prince-Bythewood overdirects the film draining it of the messiness of real life in favor of a syrupy sweetness that threatens to drown you. Appropriately enough the movie leaves you feeling like youve been chugging honey. Cast Dakota Fanning Queen Latifah Jennifer Hudson Alicia Keys Sophie Okonedo Lincoln Taylor Nate Parker Paul Bettany.

Dakota Fanning top and Jennifer Hudson star in The Secred Life of Bees a well-intentioned film about race and reverence in the summer of 1964. Photo Sidney Baldwin AP The Secret Life of Bees 1 / 1 Back to Gallery TheSecret Life of Bees is a deeply felt well-intentioned film about race and reverence in the summer of 64. Like the ambrosia at the center of the plot it moves slowly and tastes sweet. But a little bit of honey goes a long way. And somewhere between the first spoon and the last -- between the tears and the revelations between the softly melodic preachifying on love and the nature of bees -- it gets to be too much. Written and directed by Love amp; Basketballs Gina Prince-Bythewood from the best-selling novel by Sue Monk Kidd The Secret Life of Bees tells of a child with a tragic past and a seemingly hopeless present Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) a blond wisp of a girl who accidentally killed her mother at the age of 4. Now 14 she lives with her abusive father (Paul Bettany chucking his usual English decorum) in South Carolina. She craves affection feeling not just unloved but unlovable. But for all her pain Lily has spunk. She has a stash of relics that belonged to her mother including a mysterious print of a black Madonna. And she has Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson once again a wounded spirit) a kind black housekeeper determined to vote under the Civil Rights Act. When Rosaleen gets beaten by racists on her way to register Lily springs her from the hospital and heads off on a search of her mothers story. The Madonna herself leads the way as Lily spots her on a jar of honey at a store. This in turns leads them to the beekeeping idyll of the three African-American Boatwright sisters prickly June (neo-soul singer Alicia Keys) Earth mother August (Queen Latifah august by definition) and the vulnerable grieving May (Martian Childs Sophie Okonedo). Rosaleen and Lily help with the cooking and the hives in exchange for room and board. And Lily meets a fine young teenager (Tristan Wilds 90210). They also learn about the ""Daughters of Mary"" -- a mostly female congregation that gathers around a pump-fisted black Madonna on Sundays praying for strength and deliverance. And Lily learns how it feels to be loved. Flush with Rogier Stoffers creamy photography the film has a leisurely late-summer dreaminess that would feel like nostalgia if it werent for all that contemporary music (India.Arie Sam amp; Ruby) on the soundtrack. Girl bonding is the first order of business; the bees themselves are second laid out as a metaphor for the veiled complexities of life. Everyone has a secret pain. Jim Crow hardships in the outside world provide stark contrast to the race-blind attitudes of the Boatwrights matriarchal utopia. As in The Cider House Rules the bee yard has its own set of precepts but theyre not a microcosm of societys -- theyre more of a rebuttal. Dont be afraid. Dont be an idiot. Dont swat. And above all says August ""Send the bees love ... because every livin thing wants to be loved."" Some of this dialogue turns a bit gluey in the actors mouths as though it were clipped from herbal-tea boxes or a discontinued line of sympathy cards. The ladies devotion to Mary supposedly the heart of the matter seems cursory and precious. And as much as I love Queen Latifah I can take only so many buttery aphorisms from a single character no matter how wise. Yet the movie works some magic. It jerks some tears. When tragedy struck in the later reels and Fanning turned on those sad wide gray-blue blinkers of hers unleashing torrents of saline I was right there with her. Call it schmaltz if you like but The Secret Life of Bees portions out colorblind lessons of healing and hope. With a teaspoon of honey -- or a case of the stuff. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Columbia Mens/Womens Vent Cush Flip Sandals for 15 + free...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post It is the 1960s and the 28-acre Boatwright spread in Tiburon S.C. is more refuge than hive. Sure matriarch August is depicted in ""The Secret Life of Bees"" with a knowing smile and emotional heft by a Queen named Latifah. But in this warm adaptation of Sue Monk Kidds beloved debut novel her sisters May and June are hardly worker bees. Yes the home is a sturdy vessel amid the roiling waters of the civil rights era. As proof a ships wooden figurehead holds a place of honor in their parlor. Sundays the room is transformed into a church of can-do spirituality a place to pay tribute to past survival and envision future triumphs. This is where Lily Owens and Rosaleen come to live in the summer of 1964 shortly after President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. Amid her dead mothers scant possessions 14-year-old Lily finds an image of a black Madonna and child. Its artwork for the Boatwrights honey jars with ""Tiburon"" written on the back. (Artist Charles Bibbs designed the image.) Dakota Fanning and Jennifer Hudson play Lily and Rosaleen. The former flees her father. Caretaker Rosaleen is escaping further retribution after standing up to an ignorant man on a town street. Directed by Gina Prince- Blythewood ""The Secret Life of Bees"" maintains a smartly calibrated balance between the personal and the historic between nature and culture. Sunbeams illuminate motes of pollen floating in the woods. Hives that seem hushed on closer inspection reveal the cooling buzz of a thousand wings at work. Sister Junes cello notes waft out the screen door. But signs of change and social strife abound. And the director (who debuted so well with ""Love amp; Basketball"" in 2000) doesnt shrink from visions -- or epithets -- of ugliness. A group of men rushes a segregated movie house balcony where Lily and Augusts godson Zach (Tristan Wilds) sit watching a surf flick. The film (like Kidds novel) knows the pitfalls of what could be called ""mammy narratives."" It pays heed to the coming-of-age story of a young girl without sacrificing the already rich lives of the women who come to care for her. The female stars of ""The Secret Life of Bees"" are a casting directors dream. Latifah Hudson Alicia Keys and Sophie Okonedo. Theres a lot of gold in them thar names -- Oscars and Oscar nominations Golden Globes Grammys -- and likely more to come. Okonedo is especially luminous as the deeply empathetic May. A twin who lost her match years earlier shes taken on the worlds sorrows. A low-slung stone wall dotted with folded pieces of paper runs along the property. This is Mays Wailing Wall. ""Those bits of paper"" August tells Lily ""are all the heavy feelings May carries around."" Playing Lily with a haunted quality is Fanning arguably the most intriguing performer of her young generation. The Georgia native looks at times feral -- blond hair dulled eyes encircled -- the way a kid under duress might look. The story opens with her mothers tragic death but is also colored by the time Deborah Owens up and left T. Ray and Lily. Fanning captures the way a young aware girl might raise herself with that painful knowledge. Lily and Rosaleens arrival is met with a patient openness by August and May. June is the exception. Sultry voiced Keys has an earlier-era movie-star smolder but she brings unexpected fierceness to the sister who wears an NAACP T-shirt and capri pants. She makes boyfriend Neil (Nate Parker) work and wait for a sign she might marry him. In a late scene of solidarity you can imagine her pulling out a revolver to resolve the standoff. Paul Bettany has the thankless task of playing T. Ray a punishing man hardened by work and disappointment. Its difficult to scrounge sympathy for him. Yet Bettany finds some hard seed of truth in the farmers furious gestures. T. Ray batting rotting peaches into the night air angry that Lily has run away is such a moment.

Comments The Secret Life of Bees This adaptation of Sue Monk Kidds best-selling novel affords Queen Latifah and Alicia Keys good roles but thanks to Gina Prince-Blythewoods treacly screenplay and plodding direction the movie quickly congeals into a mess of sentimental cliches. Set in South Carolina in 1964 it stars the annoyingly precocious Dakota Fanning as a spunky teen grieving for her dead mother; after fleeing her abusive father (a mumbling Paul Bettany) shes taken in by the rural black family of beekeepers that once sheltered her mom. Latifah projects authority and warmth as the oldest sister and Keys strikes sparks as the middle sister an outspoken civil rights activist but Sophie Okonedo (Hotel Rwanda) is too mannered as the feeble youngest sibling. Jennifer Hudson adds some grit to a project that might have worked better as a Hallmark TV special. PG-13 110 min.

"Secret Life of Bees The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; secret-life-of-bees-the ) Secret Life of Bees The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli When it comes to movies that touch the heart few have a more delicate yet undeniable impact than Gina Prince-Bythewoods The Secret Life of Bees. Adapted from the novel by Sue Monk Kidd the production achieves something few literary interpretations succeed at bringing out the inner voice of a character without resorting to an incessant voiceover. This is due in no small part to the mature nuanced performance of Dakota Fanning whose talent continues to develop as she ages. By resisting the temptation to over-emote Fanning makes Lily an individual worthy of sympathy and admiration. The story unfolds against the backdrop of the Civil Rights tumult of 1964 in the South. The films approach to bigotry and discrimination is unflinching. By not softening the edges of some of the racially charged confrontations The Secret Life of Bees earns a PG-13 rating. In recent years there has been an upswing in movies dealing with this period of American history (most of them about the integration of sports) but few have presented as honest an appraisal as this one. Often elements are toned down in order to attain a PG rating. (The Express for example.) Lily Owens (Fanning) is a wise-beyond-her-age 14-year old whose primary education has been at the School of Hard Knocks. As we see in a prologue she accidentally killed her mother when she was just four years old and that event has shaped her life for a decade. Her father T. Ray (Paul Bettany) is frequently drunk and more frequently neglectful. Her sole source of affection is her nanny Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson). Its a lonely life for Lily but she endures because she has no choice. Two events occur to upset the status quo. T. Ray spitefully dispels Lilys most cherished notions about her mother and Rosaleen is beaten and arrested after insulting a white man. (In 1964 South Carolina looking askance at a white man could be deemed a punishable offense.) Determined to run away Lily packs a bag and sneaks Rosaleen out of the hospital room where she is under guard. Lilys destination is a town whose name she discovered on one of her mothers possessions. Once there Lily and Rosaleen find their way to the home of the three Boatwright sisters August (Queen Latifa) June (Alicia Keys) and May (Sophie Okonedo). Prosperous and generally respected in their community the Boatwrights are known for making some of the best honey in the area. Its not the bees that draw Lily to them however but their possible connection to her mother. The Secret Life of Bees effectively colors the background and fills out the secondary characters while never losing its focus on Lily. The setting is one of powerful contradictions with America teetering on the brink. The hope of a better future - the ""dream"" of Martin Luther King - is counterbalanced by the anger and prejudice of the present. The beauty of the countryside is contrasted with the close-mindedness of the towns. And Lily comes close to truth only while living a lie. The Secret Life of Bees offers a twist on a common theme of racially sensitive stories. One often criticized approach to such films is to offer a white character who becomes a champion of the undertrodden and by joining them catalyzes their salvation. The reverse occurs here the white character Lily is saved by the black ones. They show her that its possible to find joy in even the most seemingly joyless of situations and that love is possible for those who believe themselves to be unloved and unloveable. For Lily this isnt just a coming-of-age story; its a tale of redemption. And its through her quest to find forgiveness and affection that The Secret Life of Bees provides its most stirring emotional impact. The cinematography is beautiful and evocative transporting viewers back a half-century to a time when so many material things are familiar while attitudes are in many ways so different. The film spends a little time teaching the basics of bee-keeping and honey-making and while it falls short of a Discovery Channel-style dissertation about the subject these scenes hold a certain fascination. Of course theres symbolic significance to this as one can deduce from the title. The Secret Life of Bees doesnt refer only to what happens in the colony; it has more universal implications. For Fanning this is a leap forward from Hounddog. Her character here is in many ways similar to the girl she played in the earlier movie but the nature and quality of the performance is much different. Given the superior material of The Secret Life of Bees and the sure-handed direction of sophomore filmmaker Prince-Bythewood Fanning shines in a role that requires her to teeter back and forth between adult and child displaying decisiveness one moment and uncertainty the next. Jodie Foster was the same age as Fanning when she received an Oscar nomination for Taxi Driver; it would not be surprising for comparisons to be made. The parts are not similar but the strength of the performances are. The other actress to stand out is unsurprisingly Queen Latifa whose intense screen presence makes her a force to be reckoned with even when shes simply standing in the background not saying anything. Latifa is the most generous of actresses never stealing scenes from her co-stars and its this quality that makes the performance all the more impressive. When one thinks of the acting in The Secret Life of Bees Fanning comes to mind first but Latifa isnt far behind. The rest of the cast is solid but unspectacular. Alicia Keys and Sophie Okonedo are fine (but no more) as Augusts sisters. Considering that she won an acting Oscar and brought some needed energy to Sex and the City Jennifer Hudson is a little disappointing bringing little of distinction to a character who too easily fades from the foreground. If theres a sense that the films ending is a little abrupt thats a credit to the filmmakers. Lily is such a vibrant character and her world is so expertly formed that we want the story to extend beyond what could reasonably be considered its natural end-point. Its hard to imagine that The Secret Life of Bees wont be part of many Oscar conversations. It has the intelligence craftsmanship and heart to win over both critics and regular movie-goers.

"Movie review The Secret Life of Bees -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Secret Life of Bees -- 2 out of 5 stars Lily Owens (Fanning) escapes her lonely life and troubled relationship with her father by fleeing with her caregiver and only friend to a town that holds the secret to her late mothers past. Taken in by the intelligent and independent Boatwright sisters Lily finds solace in their mesmerizing world of beekeeping. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The thing about honey is that its not just sweet but awfully gooey.That goes for the new film The Secret Life of Bees too. Is the sweetness worth the stickiness in this maudlin American Sisterhood of the Traveling Green Tomatoes? Its a writerly coming-of-age piece set in the Civil Rights summer in South Carolina. But its also precious self-conscious a hug you give at arms length.Dakota Fanning awkwardly leaving her child star days behind is Lily a 14 year-old whose last memory of her mother (Amy Adams) is of accidentally shooting her during a fight between her parents. Her sullen redneck father (Paul Bettany very good) doesnt know how to cope with her. Only Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) the housekeeper understands the child. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 has just passed and Rosaleen brimming with pride takes Lily with her to town so that she can register to vote and buy Lily her first training bra. Racists beat Rosaleen and she and Lily flee to a town Lily only knows because its name is scribbled on the back of a picture of her mom. In tiny Tiburon Lily tries to piece together what made her mother happy about this place years before.Thats where she meets the Boatwright sisters bee-keepers black women of culture and kindness. August (Queen Latifah) is the queen bee June (Alicia Keys more an exotic presence than an actress) is her testy cellist sister and May (Sophie Okonedo of Hotel Rwanda) is the damaged sibling a woman who feels every emotion so keenly that she has built a Wailing Wall behind their big pink house.Based on Sue Monk Kidds novel The Secret Life of Bees is a movie is nicely anchored in a trio of very good performances. Bettany lets us see the pain and loss behind T-Rays hatefulness. Hudson starts living up to her Dreamgirls Oscar with a subtle turn here. And Latifah handles the bee-keeping metaphors with ease. Life she says is like the bee yard.""Dont be afraid. But dont be an idiot. Dont swat. Above all send the bees love because every little thing wants to be loved."" Writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood did Love amp; Basketball years back and shes still working on the surface. Theres rich if predictable material here but she cant make it sing or give the bees the visual poetry that Ulees Gold had. It doesnt help that the film has too much voice-over narration read by Fanning or that shes grown up into a calculating actress determined to sexualize every tween role.But for all the goo Bees is still a wholesome and warm film about a girl finding acceptance at a time when black America was doing the same.

Youre going to need them with The Secret Life of Bees Gina Prince-Bythewoods film based on Sue Monk Kidds novel. Nothing wrong with a weeper of course as long as it earns its tears honestly. Bees does for the most part largely through performances that rise above the sometimes too-pat material to convey - and elicit - real emotion. Dakota Fanning plays Lily Owens a 14-year-old girl growing up in South Carolina in 1964. After a family tragedy shes being raised by T. Ray (Paul Bettany) a hard bitter man whos cruel to her. When he trashes her mother Lily hits the road along with their housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) who has been beaten by a gang of racist thugs (and then arrested) for trying to register to vote. They wind up at the home of the Boatwright women three sisters who own a honey business. August (Queen Latifah) tends to the bees. June (Alicia Keys) is stern practically daring anyone - including Lily - to cross her. Yet she also plays the cello. May (Sophie Okonedo) is somehow off a bit emotionally and mentally; she never recovered from the death of her twin sister. Unable to escape her sadness she spends a lot of time at the wailing wall she built for herself writing notes about her feelings and poking them into the rocks. Lily and Rosaleen thrive with the Boatwrights. Lily learns about beekeeping from August while Rosaleen works with May in the kitchen. (June mostly reads and sulks when not fending off proposals from her boyfriend.) August has an almost preternatural calm about her which sets the tone for both the household and the film. Its a comfortable life but not trouble-free. Racism will rear its head again - the Civil Rights Act has just been signed enraging some Southerners - Lily must cope with guilt and questions about her past and of course its only a matter of time before T. Ray shows up looking for her. Fanning proves - again - that shes successfully transitioning from child actress to out-and-out good actress. Latifahs calming presence is as soothing as Bettanys is jagged and dangerous. Keys is fantastic a simmering rage kept barely below the surface (most of the time). Best of all is Okonedo. May struggles in many ways yet Okonedo embodies her with pride and a sense of dignity - and a terrible sadness as well. Her performance as well as the others elevates Bees to the place where its not all honey but has a little sting too. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

From B-movie beginnings The Secret Life of Bees a family drama set in the civil-rights-era South chugs along pleasantly like a television special tailored for the crossover female market. Which is basically what it is though it drops tantalizing hints that it has more on its mind than a benign tale of substitute mothering across the color line. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - When next we meet the bereft white tot its 1964 the year Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. Lily (the ever-capable Dakota Fanning) has grown into a teenager under the dubious care of her bullying father (Paul Bettany doing a glassy-eyed imitation of Brad Dourif on a bender) who bolsters his daughters self-esteem by making her stand on a pile of grits for hours and feeding her conviction that she murdered her mother. Sensitive and insecure Lily dreams of bees swarming out of her bedroom walls and thinks of escape. When her caregiver Rosaleen (played with more guts than talent by Jennifer Hudson) gets beaten up by white-trash racists on her way to register to vote the two young women make a break for safety which they find in the home of the three black Boatwright sisters motherless themselves but more solidly equipped for life by upbringing and adversity than Lily.Bees is adapted from the novel by white Southern writer Sue Monk Kidd and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood whose well-received 2000 movie Love amp; Basketball blended lively commercial instincts with a powerful sense of street-level racial politics. Commerce gets the upper hand this time around bathing the Boatwright habitat in a honeyed glow with the soundtracks jaunty Motown music tempered by a soft guitar when the legacy of Southern racism pokes in its unwelcome head. The sisters are sweetly folksy Little Women relentlessly role-modeling the good life for Lily. Damaged child-like May played with cloying innocence by British actress Sophie Okonedo (Hotel Rwanda) dispenses universal goodwill. Headstrong musical June (Alicia Keys) whos active in the fledgling NAACP shows Lily how to push back. And the fact that the eldest August (Queen Latifah) makes honey for a living tells you all you need to know about what she can do for our poor confused runaway.Doubt must be harbored about any movie in which Queen Latifah is made to say ""Ever lil thing wants to be loved"" without rolling her eyes. Latifah is a favorite of mine whose pride in her physical bounty reminds me a lot of another favorite. Like Dolly Parton Latifah deftly juggles maternal warmth with come-hither sexuality but her twinkly benevolence contains a hidden warning Im here to get along with everyone but dont test me. As the glamorous singing matriarch Motormouth Maybelle she eclipsed a capering John Travolta and almost everyone else in Hairspray. But stately black actresses approaching middle age always run the risk of getting locked in as the face of Black Equanimity -- and here Latifah succumbs without a struggle.

Sep. 13 600pm In a key scene August whose smiling dignity is inspired by Southern legends of the Black Madonna explains to her eager new apprentice Lily all the different ways in which bees show their love by building solid families and communities. Thats nice but for a movie with serious black aristocracy (the Will Smiths) behind it Bees waters down its own compelling racial subtext which seeks to recover the civil-war era for those black women who made life better for the white female bosses on whom they also depended. Only near the end when August reveals the nature of her connection with and ambivalent love for Lilys dead mother does the film fleetingly complicate the hoary old Gone With the Wind-fed delusion that the love of poor black nannies for their white charges was pure and undiluted.

In the screen version of Sue Monk Kidds smash-hit novel The Secret Life of Bees 14-year-old Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) escapes the clutches of her redneck father (Paul Bettany) in 1964 South Carolina by running away from home accompanied by her caretaker Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) who is wanted by the police. (She had dared to insult the racists who tried to prevent her from registering to vote.) In a small-town general store Lily spots a jar of honey with the mysterious image of a black Madonna on the label. Seeking the source of the jar she and Rosaleen meet August Boatwright (Queen Latifah) a maternal beekeeper who lives in a cozy pink house and is just as hearty and sweet as the honey Bees she harvests. The two are invited to stay for a while and so they move in go to work and get to know August and her sisters the regal gifted June (Alicia Keys) who teaches cello and lowers her shield of pride for no one (even the handsome beau who adores her) and the childlike May (Sophie Okonedo) who is prone to sudden crying jags. When you read The Secret Life of Bees you know why the book sold 5 million copies. Kidd is a seductive writer with a voice that carries just enough moonlight and magnolias to evoke the desultory Southern lyricism of To Kill a Mockingbird. Each character vibrates with mystery. In the movie version adapted by writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love amp; Basketball) the architecture of the plot is about all that remains apart from a few stray thoughts about queen bees as metaphors. The film has no poetry or atmosphere; it presents the Boathouse women as TV-movie wisps of characters. Latifah glows with benevolent strength Keys glowers like shes warming up to star in The Angela Davis Story and Okonedo is a tremulous wallflower. This has the unfortunate effect -- far different from the books -- of making it seem as if these women had been placed on earth in order to help one confused distraught white girl find her way. Fanning may look 14 but perhaps because shes been playing precocious kids for so long she still acts younger without the sensual curiosity of the books heroine. Lilys romance with a black teenager Zachary (Tristan Wilds) should be incendiary but it falls flat and her connection to the death of her mother is a Big Event that haunts the movie far too mechanically. Over the years weve all seen too many anachronistic ""magic Negroes"" in movies like Forrest Gump and The Green Mile. The saintly African-American matriarchy of The Secret Life of Bees may appear benign by comparison. Yet the film set in the civil rights era has a dated musty piety that too often evokes the liberal message mongering of that time. The Secret Life of Bees is a lesson -- or rather a whole series of them -- we no longer need to learn. Of course its also a divine-sisterhood-defeats-all chick flick and on that score theres no denying that its cliches are rousingly up to date.

Like a mouthful of honey ""The Secret Life of Bees"" is cloyingly sweet and gooey and youre not quite sure you can swallow it undiluted. Based on Sue Monk Kidds popular 2002 novel about Southern sisterhood during the civil rights movement and toplining Dakota Fanning and Queen Latifah the Fox Searchlight release should attract fans of the bestselling tome and arthouse patrons but will be held back from breakout biz by poor word of mouth. Helmer Gina Prince-Bythewood who adapted the book apparently had one instructive word for her actors (""earnest"") and one for her d.p. (""signify""). Opening in 1964 South Carolina the story follows young Lily (Fanning) from the storys rather terrific opening line (""I killed my mother when I was 4 years old ..."") and a perilous relationship with her abusive father (a very good Paul Bettany) to the motherly embrace of the beekeeping highly cultured August Boatwright (Latifah) and her sisters May (Sophie Okonedo) and June (Alicia Keyes). The Civil Rights Act has been signed and the South is not reacting well especially toward women like Lilys housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) who are sick of racist abuse. When Rosaleen is arrested -- after being assaulted by rednecks -- she and Lily flee like a distaff Huck and Jim and end up at Chez Boatwright. ""Its like they got their own spot in the world where the outside dont come in"" Rosaleen says dreamily. The movie is full of lines like that. Like ""Secret Lifes"" score -- almost exclusively contempo pop and all too deliberate -- the film has no use for its own time or even place and seems intent on giving the actresses all the room they need to be as broad as possible. The characters as written are little more than one-dimensional which doesnt make for interesting nuanced drama. But the performers do the best with the faux-profound platitudes theyre given. Latifah is all nobility and empowerment which may be the kind of thing that brings audiences in (it certainly made the book popular). Fanning has grown out of the juvenile roles that made her famous but retains her openness and vulnerability. Pop star Keyes is a revelation in her third bigscreen role (after ""Smokin Aces"" and ""The Nanny Diaries"") and Okonedo always first-rate shows enormous sensitivity playing the simple-minded May.
