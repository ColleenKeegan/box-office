In short she falls out of a tree the trauma of which apparently rids her body of its deadly ailment--and definitively kills the audiences suspension of disbelief. Accepting such an event as a ""miracle"" is a hard pill to swallow for those who might not subscribe to the religious foundation the film stands upon. Doctors aiding Annas recovery initially dismiss her gargantuan bloated stomach and months-long vomiting spells as ""acid reflux"" scoffing as they say things like ""Well Im the doctor and thats my diagnosis"" when their authority is questioned. By the time we encounter the third in a series of sweepingly generalized groups classified under the umbrella of non-believers (journalists and restaurant staff are portrayed as godless monsters just like those pesky doctors) its obvious that Miracles From Heavens goal is not to endear viewers to its spiritual ways but rather cast judgment on those who dont follow its teachings. You cant endear when youre subtly insulting and Miracles From Heavens otherwise good intentions are lost in its confusing mix of uplifting spirituality and judgment. Further adding to the films identity crisis Garners never-ending pursuit of her on-screen daughters cure is punctuated by an obscure cinematic language one that features characters breaking into random asides for upwards-facing pleas to the sky above multiple sermons from a local preacher (John Carroll Lynch) and intermittent musical numbers from Christian rock groups peppered throughout. These moments are well intentioned but the film too often registers as a pop-up book version of scriptural text with live-action footnotes padding an otherwise simplistic one-track narrative. Niche cinema often appeals to few and great niche cinema can speak to anyone once they sit down in front of it but Miracles From Heaven is prickly by nature knowing exactly who its audience is as it expects their pre-established religious convictions to fill the gaps in its shoddy craftsmanship. Miracles From Heaven stands firm atop a sloppily made case for faith over logic and spirituality over science and for that its challenging to view as a film instead of judgmental ideology in cinematic drag. Despite what Miracles From Heaven tries to show us ""believing"" is still a challenging concept to sell even if the next film built around the idea is filled with characters who arent simply products of luck and circumstance.

In the dark of a theater a good movie transports the viewer obliterating scaffolds of skepticism and cold logic.""Miracles From Heaven"" is not a good movie.It is testimony a dramatization of a spiritual memoir of the same name in which a sick little girls near-death experience takes her beyond the mortal plane and sends her back home with a miracle. It is a movie by believers about believers for believers to the exclusion of all else custom-tailored for private church-group showings.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Jennifer Garner plays a mother whose faith is tested after her daughter develops a rare incurable illness in Miracles From Heaven. VPCPeople of faith should be offended that Hollywood filmmakers think this little of them.The Beam family is postcard perfect. The churchgoing clan -- mother Christy (Jennifer Garner) father Kevin (Martin Henderson) and a trio of daughters -- is loving and sweet on their spacious Texas ranch which they have just drained of equity to launch a veterinary business. They are blessed and pretty people the very model of nuclear-family perfection.RELATED Jennifer Garner finds faith again in Miracles From HeavenThat is until middle daughter Anna (Kylie Rogers) gets sick. Very sick. Her sudden onset of violent vomiting spells swollen belly and constant pain prove to be symptoms of a serious -- and incurable -- gastrointestinal disorder that without a miracle will eventually take her life.Good thing the word ""miracle"" is right in the title.The illness of a child always opens the door to certain theological questions. Why does a loving God let the innocent suffer? Why do bad things happen to good people? Anna weary with pain asks ""Why do you think God hasnt healed me?"" How does a mother answer that? They are good questions except that ""Miracles From Heaven"" is less about finding faith than defending it.Mexican superstar Eugenio Derbez plays a doctor who treats the daughter of Christy (Jennifer Garner) in the inspirational drama ""Miracles from Heaven."" Exclusionary to the core People of faith should be offended that Hollywood filmmakers think this little of them. (Photo TriStar Pictures)This is a world of carefully calculated straw men where doctors are cocky and cynical reporters are atheists (rude ones at that). The film is peppered with unbelievers who try to get in the way and who will come around in their own good time probably to the heavily produced strains of Christian rock performed by Georgia band Third Day. This isnt storytelling; its a commercial for Jesus made for people who already believe in him.The laziness on display doesnt stop at the sort of tepid theological musings most people resolve at summer Bible camp. Queen Latifah plays one of the movies few characters of color Angela a divorced and struggling waitress who drops everything and offers to take Christy and Anna in town to see a specialist on a tour of Boston. Angelas flashy braids ""urban"" attitude and beat-up jalopy are played for yuks as she ferries the Beams around from aquarium to art museum and points beyond because hardscrabble Black Boston waitresses are falling all over themselves to make random White Texans smile.This is inexcusably tone-deaf. ""Miracles From Heaven"" is exclusionary to the core barring entrance to everyone not already in its close-knit evangelical crew giving fist bumps at a Christian rock concert.Its soulless targeting of a key demographic hungry for faith-based entertainment is mercenary and the faithful deserve better.

Its a good Christian film that plays to its audience and preaches the importance of neighborly values.When Anna (Kylie Rogers) an active little girl who loves climbing trees begins complaining of abnormal stomach pains her parents take her to a series of doctors who misdiagnose her ailment as lactose intolerance and acid reflux. (""The Rings"" Martin Henderson looking for the world like Billy Ray Cyrus plays Annas father Kevin.) Finally they learn she has a disease called psuedo-obstruction motility disorder which leaves her bloated and unable to pass food.It is recommended that Anna see a leading pediatrician based out of Boston which puts a strain on the familys already tight resources. There Christy and Anna befriend Angela (Queen Latifah) a waitress who takes them around the city and becomes their Boston tour guide.Between the church-set scenes Christian rock montages and discussions of prayer faith is never far from the focus. ""Miracles from Heaven"" stays fairly grounded save for a late-in-the-game set piece that recalls the more fanciful parts of ""What Dreams May Come.""That sequence sets the film in another realm but whats important is ""Miracles from Heaven"" believes its own story and aptly passes it on to viewers.Its faith in itself never wavers.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaMiracles from HeavenGRADE BRated PG for thematic material including accident and medical imagesRunning time 109 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1pt2BnD MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/03/15/review-faith-based-heaven-preaches-community-values/81835216/,200,miraclesfromheaven3,miraclesfromheaven,detroitnews

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Mark Jenkins March 16 Christy (Jennifer Garner) grows frustrated when a steady stream of doctors cant diagnose whats wrong with her sick daughter Anna (Kylie Rogers) in ""Miracles from Heaven."" (Chuck Zlotnick/Sony Pictures Entertainment) Mexican-born California-based director Patricia Riggen has developed something of a specialization in marvels. Just a few months ago her fact-based drama ""The 33"" celebrated the combination of technology and luck that saved 33 Chilean miners who had become trapped deep underground. In 2007 Riggens ""Under the Same Moon"" sent a young Mexican boy across the U.S. border on a providential quest for his mother. With her latest film Riggen has gone fully supernatural In ""Miracles from Heaven"" a little girl receives medical care from the physician upstairs. The movie is based on a 2015 memoir by Christy Beam whose daughter made a most unusual recovery from a severe gastrointestinal condition. It was produced by the team that made ""Heaven is for Real"" adapted from a similar account of a childs religious experience. The new film should draw the same sort of admirers -- and detractors -- as the earlier one. Religious belief aside ""Miracles"" is the weaker of the two films. Stretched across nearly two hours it tells a story that would have been adequately laid out in a 30-second television spot. The question is never what will happen to 10-year-old Anna (Kylie Rogers) who suffers a bloated belly and chronic pain. The only issue is how long she and the audience will have to wait to find out. When the film begins Anna is living with her mother (Jennifer Garner) her veterinarian father (Martin Henderson) and two sisters on a Texas ranch. The family regularly attends one of those Protestant churches that seems to have traded the choir for a Christian-rock band. Based on her memoir of the same name Christy Beams (Jennifer Garner) daughter is suffering from a serious digestive disorder. After a near-death experience falling out of a tree she is subsequently cured of the disease. (Sony Pictures) In this somewhat fictionalized account Annas affliction arrives suddenly. A series of condescending doctors misdiagnose the problem until Christy becomes angry and despondent. She even stops going to church. Eventually Christy takes her daughter to Boston Childrens Hospital pushing past others on the waiting list for an appointment with the leading expert Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez). Hes competent and compassionate and spends a lot of time at play with his patients. No wonder he has a nine-month backlog. Although Dr. Nurko makes Anna somewhat better a lasting cure would require one of two things divine intercession or a medical fluke. The movies title has already telegraphed its choice. The plight of ailing children and desperate parents can touch the hearts of anyone who has a kid or who has been one. And Garner proves effective as the fierce if occasionally weepy mama bear. But the movie is stuffed with filler notably an annoying interlude with a Waitress with a Heart of Gold (and a car of tin) played by Queen Latifah in a case of racial stereotyping. While waiting for the advertised miracle some viewers may wish for divine intervention of another sort -- not from this movies God who appears as a delicate butterfly but from the cranky Old Testament one. He could sweep away the cardboard supporting characters as easily as he did the Egyptians in the Red Sea. PG. At area theaters. Contains a child in peril and medical unpleasantness. 109 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Producers of faith-based films are ramping up the star power and tamping down the evangelical messages to reach audiences beyond Christian church-goers. (Chuck Zlotnick/Sony Pictures via AP) Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Miracles from Heaven 3.0 stars Starring Jennifer Garner Queen Latifah Kylie Rogers Directed by Patricia Riggen Written by Randy Brown Duration 109 minutes Related Stories Jennifer Garner finds faith in Miracles From Heaven Its hard to argue with the success of Sonys box office-minded faith-based movie arm Affirm - leaning as it does on ""name"" actors and directors and compelling often real stories that entertain even us heathens. Even a movie like the recent Risen - about a Roman investigating the ostensible hoax of Christs resurrection (for which it earned the nickname CSI Judea) - doesnt make you feel like youve just been to Sunday school. This is also true of the Jennifer Garners four-hankie sick-daughter-saved-by-prayer movie Miracles from Heaven notwithstanding the fact that it opens in church with one of two performances by a Christian rock band. (Just as an aside I believe Christian rock ill serves both rock and Christianity and I say this as a survivor of Catholic folk masses.) But thats how they roll in the Texas town where Miracles from Heaven happens (not coincidentally one of the movies producers is pastor T.D. Jakes of Heaven Is for Real fame). The real story as told in a book by mom Christy Beam is that their daughter Anna (Kylie Rogers) suffered a rare ""motility disease"" that made her incapable of digesting food the prognosis for which was eventual and painful death. After years of suffering Anna accidentally fell down the hollow trunk of a large tree and had to be rescued in a media-magnet event. Anna claimed to have while concussed talked with God. After recovering from her injuries anomalously she became ""asymptomatic"" of a supposedly incurable disease. Miracles from Heaven wrings this story for everything its worth and is ultimately saved from mawkishness by the utter believability of Garners performance as a mother who would do anything to save her daughter. One tour de force scene takes place at the Boston office of a top pediatric motility specialist Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez) where Garners Christy begs with almost elemental force to have her daughter moved up a nine-month waiting list. Martin Henderson (Greys Anatomy) plays the veterinarian dad Martin whose everything-is-going-to-be-alright mantra clashes with moms desperation and shaken faith. And the actresses who play the three daughters are uniformly adorable - not least of them Rogers who manages to convey both spunk and suffering with the aplomb of any accomplished adult actor. Exact details are malleable here the waiting-room scene was made up certain characters were composites and Queen Latifah - her 100-watt smile in ""on"" position - plays a Boston waitress-turned-pal who in real life is a white Irishwoman. None of it really affects the storys impact (and the colourblind casting is a positive). Also to its credit Miracles from Heaven takes a few shots inside its own circle at the judgmental faithful (there were actually parishioners who told Beam she or her daughter or both were clearly being punished for something). This contravention of the lessons of Job is shot down effectively by familiar-face John Carroll Lynch as cool Pastor Scott (who also hired the Christian rock band but well cut him some slack). Saved or not its a hard heart indeed that wont well up at certain teary moments in Miracles from Heaven. So be warned.

Photo Credit Sony Pictures / Chuck Zlotnick advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A girl with a severe medical condition is inexplicably cured. Based on a said-to-be true story.CAST Jennifer Garner Kylie Rogers Queen LatifahLENGTH 148RATED PG (some squeamish medical sequences)BOTTOM LINE Garners solid performance helps elevate a potentially preachy movie to the level of passable drama. ""Miracles From Heaven"" tells the supposedly true story of Anna Beam a young girl with a life-threatening medical condition who after a near-death experience and a brush with God is suddenly cured. Its almost but not quite a repeat of 2014s ""Heaven Is For Real"" about a little boy who wakes up from surgery knowing things only God could have told him. Whats interesting about the newer film -- both were produced by the megachurch pastor T.D. Jakes -- is the relative delicacy with which it handles its none-too-subtle material. Faith-based films are traditionally a tough sell for secular audiences but a mainstream star can help box-office prospects. Here its Jennifer Garner as Annas mom Christy a churchgoing woman living in suburban Texas with three children and a handsome husband Kevin (Martin Henderson). Garner a terrific emoter whose eyes seem made for crying (""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"") is a fine choice as a woman losing her faith as her middle daughter descends into illness. (The films other box-office draw Queen Latifah plays a friendly waitress for about three minutes.) advertisement | advertise on newsday Anna (Kylie Rogers impressively natural and rarely cloying) has an intestinal disease that prevents her from digesting food; it distends her little belly and leaves her in chronic pain. Much of the film effectively puts us inside the lives of the stressed-out Beams as they struggle to pay for expensive treatments and fly Anna to Boston to see a specialist (a likable Eugenio Derbez). Its to the films credit that when young Anna begs for death to end her misery we feel the horror and helplessness reflected on Christys face. This is where ""Miracles From Heaven"" directed by Patricia Riggen (""The 33"") and written by Randy Brown from Christy Beams book differs from other movies of its ilk. Unlike ""Heaven Is For Real"" which spent its running time proving that miracles happen -- and QED that God exists -- this film shows us a family weathering a crisis. Thats a situation that religious and secular audiences alike can empathize with. ""Miracles From Heaven"" occasionally wags a told-you-so finger at nonbelievers. But in a genre that tends to hector and bludgeon thats some kind of improvement.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Mar. 15 2016 600PM EDT Last updated Tuesday Mar. 15 2016 600PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Patricia Riggen Written by Randy Brown Starring Jennifer Garner Martin Henderson Kylie Rogers Classification PG Country USA Language English If youve ever found your eye wandering while driving down a highway youve likely spotted a bumper sticker displaying the words ""Jesus is coming. Look busy."" Studio executives must do a lot of driving too because Hollywood has taken that message to heart churning out an impressive number of faith-based films over the past few years. Jennifer Garner talks fashion and religion at Miracles from Heaven premiere (AP Video) You know the type treacly prayer-driven affairs such as Facing the Giants When the Game Stands Tall War Room and To Save a Life - movies designed to look like mainstream dramas comedies and romances but with copious scenes set inside churches and always at least one character finding themselves redeemed through the power of religion specifically evangelical Christianity.Of course Hollywoods embrace of the genre is likely more financial than devotional. If something like 2014s Heaven Is for Real can cost only 12-million (U.S.) but go on to earn 101.3-million then Id imagine producers have come-to-Jesus moments every Monday morning once the box office figures roll in.To add to these religious awakenings is Miracles from Heaven the latest offering from Sonys Affirm Films label which specializes in producing movies that preach to the choir. Yet this new film strategically opening just a week and a half before Easter is a slightly more curious product to come out of the faith-based film machine.Basically Miracles from Heaven boasts a genuine movie star in Jennifer Garner easily the highest-profile performer to latch on to the genre (sorry Nicolas ""Left Behind"" Cage and Greg ""Heaven Is for Real"" Kinnear). Why exactly Garner decided to star in the film is a matter between the actress and her god but lets hope there was a sizable paycheque involved because Miracles from Heaven is mostly an embarrassment.The film is competently shot by director Patricia Riggen and decently acted by Garner as far as melodramas go. But it contains such an insulting message - essentially everything will be fine as long as you pray pray hard and pray specifically to Jesus Christ - and is delivered in such a forced manner that it undermines any semblance of cinematic art or entertainment. This is not a film at least as most filmmakers and audiences imagine the form. This is proselytizing pure and simple.Adapted from Christy Beams memoir the film follows the Texan mother (Garner) as she deals with the debilitating health of young daughter Anna who suffers from a severe digestive disorder. After getting the cold shoulder from the medical establishment (save one kindly doctor in Boston) Anna finds herself cured after enduring a near-death experience. Doctors are amazed. The familys pastor suggests its a miracle from above. And the little girl herself recounts a visit to heaven during her traumatic experience complete with imagery seemingly left from What Dreams May Comes cutting-room floor.And thats about it. Audiences are given the choice to either accept that yes the power of Christian faith healed this little girl. Or ... well I guess you just hate seeing healthy little girls dont you? Theres little room for middle ground. Even one of the films non-believer characters - a journalist naturally - comes around to the power of the Almighty.The movies insulting ethos is laid bare with a third-act quote from the little girl playing Anna (an actress whose name I wont mention here since her career is far too new to be forever associated with this film). Asked by Christy whether people will believe her tale Anna replies ""Not everyones going to believe and thats all right. Theyll get there when they get there.""Yes the filmmakers suggest you dont have to leave the theatre embracing the power of God. But eventually youll come around. Theyre praying that you do.

Photo Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Miracles From Heaven Running time 109 minutes. Rated PG (children in peril). The sweet sincerity of ""Miracles From Heaven"" makes it hard to dislike. If you cant be sentimental when dealing with a dying little girl when can you be? And in a brilliant twist this is a dying-kid movie in which the kid does not die. Jennifer Garner is perfectly cast as an alternately indomitable and terrified Fort Worth Texas-area mom Christy Beam. She is a Christian mother of three whose faith is shaken when her middle daughter Anna (Kylie Rogers who is spirited without being cloying) is struck by a mysterious ailment that doctors at first dismiss as acid reflux or lactose intolerance. Many breathless trips to the ER reveal that the disease is a rare incurable intestinal disorder the only expert on which is a Boston-based specialist Dr. Nurko (a delightful Eugenio Derbez) who has a 9-month waiting list for appointments. A Texas doctor tells Christy that spaces open up only when patients no longer need Nurkos care. ""You mean when sick people get better?"" she asks. ""No thats not what I mean"" he says. The clock is ticking. Medical expenses are piling up and the house has already been remortgaged so that Christys husband (Martin Henderson) can get his veterinary business going. As her daughter weakens Christy decides to take the girl to Boston and beg for an appointment. ""Miracles"" a wholesome slice of niceness shot in a honey glow suggesting a Metamucil commercial and stocked with friendly loving supporting characters such as a gently funny pastor (John Carroll Lynch) is based on the travails of a real family As seen in the closing credits the Beams are almost as adorable as their screen counterparts. Their story took a bizarre twist when Anna fell inside a hollow tree and the Lord seemed to change his mind about the way he was treating them. If you dont believe in such things the movie suggests thats fine but ""Spontaneous Remission From Heaven"" just isnt as good a title. Any Christian movie dealing in miracles is likely to be too sweet for some but this one is gently moving rather than pushy about its religious elements. It does take some strange detours though notably when a waitress (Queen Latifah) suddenly drops everything to befriend Christy and Anna and takes them on a wacky trip around Boston that does nothing to advance the plot. And a fantasy sequence involving animated butterflies and walking on clouds is a bit over the top. But then again a childs vision of heaven is bound to be pure cotton candy.

"Review Miracles From Heaven delivers a fact-based doozy but also offers more human miracles - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Miracles From Heaven delivers a fact-based doozy but also offers more human miracles Jennifer Garner in ""Miracles From Heaven"" Chuck Zlotnick / Sony Pictures Jennifer Garner left stars as Christy Beam whose ill daughter falls headfirst inside a dead tree trunk and becomes stuck for hours in ""Miracles From Heaven."" Jennifer Garner left stars as Christy Beam whose ill daughter falls headfirst inside a dead tree trunk and becomes stuck for hours in ""Miracles From Heaven."" (Chuck Zlotnick / Sony Pictures) Katie Walsh In recent years theres been a mini-trend of faith-based films concerned with proving the existence of heaven. Based on true stories films such as ""Heaven Is for Real"" and ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" take up this task. Ostensibly following on their heels is the Jennifer Garner-starring ""Miracles From Heaven"" based on an amazing -- and weird -- true story. But although the film is centered on Christian-based faith it argues for the power of miracles that are more terrestrial and quotidian.Garner plays Christy Beam mother to Anna (Kylie Rogers) who suffers from a debilitating incurable intestinal disorder. After months in the hospital one day Anna is playing with her sister climbing a tree when she falls headfirst 30 feet inside the dead tree trunk. She is stuck for hours. When firefighters pull her out not only is she unharmed but shes miraculously cured. That premise is the one presented in all of the films marketing. But ""Miracles From Heaven"" manages to be more than that. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Patricia Riggen who also directed last years ""The 33"" the story of the Chilean miner rescue brings to life the despair felt by the family during Annas illness. Much of the film is centered on Christys tireless search for a cure for Anna. Losing her faith questioning why such a small kid is in such pain Christy has a hard time recognizing the small miracles that occur daily during their ordeal -- the small kindnesses of a receptionist who helps her or a friendly waitress Angela (Queen Latifah) who offers friendship when Christy and Anna need it most.Even the love shown by their specialist Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez) is in itself a small miracle. We come to realize that the larger more amazing miracles are made up of all these small tokens of love and selflessness. Riggen effectively creates a sense of how intimidating hospitals and medical procedures are for a child often shooting from Annas perspective. The emphasis on Anna and Christys experience of these trials is a smart choice as both Garner and Rogers are strong charismatic performers. Garner is compelling as the dedicated mom questioning everything she believes while fighting for her daughters life and young Rogers gives an impressive performance as Anna struggling to maintain her sunny outlook while coping with pain and suffering.

The ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" star appeared to believe it was cathartic for the... (Nardine Saad) In terms of religion Riggen and writer Randy Brown who adapted Christy Beams book emphasize the power of community offered by the Beams church which is of the contemporary fun spiritual-rock-band variety. But even this tightknit group has its ups and downs especially when some question Annas ordeal.While the film runs a bit long and the heartstrings-tugging becomes overwrought overall this family melodrama is surprisingly effective even for those of little faith. There are those who can choose to see it as unassailable evidence that heaven exists but the film reaches beyond that audience and provides confirmation of the more human miracles that exist in everyday life if you choose to see them.Walsh is a Tribune News Service critic.------------Miracles From HeavenMPAA rating PG for thematic material including accident and medical imagesRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesIn general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on March 16 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Faith in everyday miracles - Director Patricia Riggen puts a human face on her `Miracles From Heaven. - MOVIE REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Reviews Entertainment Movies Jennifer Garner Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-miracles-from-heaven-review-20160316-story.html,200,miraclesfromheaven9,miraclesfromheaven,latimes

However this spring number of faith-based movies are available to audiences including the clearly Easter-focused ""Risen"" and ""The Young Messiah"" and the upcoming ""Gods Not Dead 2."" Now joining them is ""Miracles From Heaven"" based on Texan Christy Beams book inspired by the story experienced by her family and particularly her daughter Anna. A very earnest Jennifer Garner plays Christy showcasing the seemingly insurmountable struggle she underwent to find a cure or a treatment for Annas mysterious and clearly deadly digestive disorder. Suddenly after a freak accident -- a frightening fall into a hollow tree on her familys rural property -- Anna not only is cured but reveals her miraculous recovery was thanks to her being transported into the presence of the Almighty. Without question this movie does elicit ""feel-good"" emotions -- largely driven by Garners ability to exude genuine maternal devotion and the charm of young Kylie Rogers who is convincing as Anna especially making believable the pain the little girl must have undergone. Queen Latifah clearly was comfortable portraying a Boston waitress who befriends Christy and Anna as they struggle for an appointment to see a specialist who reportedly is the worlds leading expert on Annas condition. That gastroenterologist is ably played by Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez who adds a wonderful touch of humor and love as pediatric physicians often do as they treat kids facing really tough medical challenges. My problem with this film is that screenwriter Randy Brown and director Patricia Riggen went for the obvious choices and easy avenues to accomplish tear-jerking moments as we witness Annas journey. Of course its terrific that the young girl has recovered and continues to live the normal life wed wish for any of our children. However I constantly had the sense I was witnessing a formulaic Hallmark Channel-type approach that really did not elevate this genre in any new ways. Part of the blame goes to composer Carlo Siliottos soundtrack which swells up and down in a cheesy manner throughout the entire film. 1/2 Columbia Pictures presents a film directed by Patricia Riggen and written by Randy Brown based on the book by Christy Beam. Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG (for thematic material including accident and medical images).

Brighton Sharbino (clockwise from left) Martin Henderson Jennifer Garner Courtney Fansler Eugenio Derbez and Kylie Rogers in ""Miracles From Heaven."" Photo Chuck Zlotnick AP Miracles From Heaven has more than faith on its side 1 / 2 Back to Gallery As one might expect from a Christian film ""Miracles From Heaven"" centers on faith -- and a major miracle -- but its also a decent family drama about a mothers tribulations in caring for her sick child. The handsomely shot ""Miracles"" is not a sequel to the hit ""Heaven Is for Real"" but its from the same producers -- and theyve upped their game. There are several reasons for this a better script with universal themes and the right balance of faith sentiment and conflict. The movie gets off to a precious start as we see the impossibly cute Beam family on their impossibly cute ranchette in Texas. Theres a joke about hell being in California and every person of color seems to have left the state. The house of worship seems quaintly cozy in a place thats famous whether fairly or unfairly for its mega-churches. Soon enough though the film settles down and begins its intimate if unoriginal story which is based on true events. Anna a 10-year-old bookworm has been vomiting regularly but no one can figure out why. After some painful trial and error her parents discover that she has a rare -- and incurable -- intestinal disorder. Anna is slowly but surely dying. There have been plenty of movies about untreatable diseases so much of the watchability factor hinges on the performances and fortunately for ""Miracles"" the cast is solid particularly Jennifer Garner who plays Annas mother Christy. The anguish of Christy -- and her resulting crisis of faith -- is written across Garners face and its palpable. Garner who has a natural screen presence clearly understands motherhood and even the most hardened of souls will find it hard not to sympathize with her plight. Kylie Rogers effectively underplays her role of Anna John Carroll Lynch makes for an appealingly nonjudgmental pastor and Wayne Pere has a memorable turn as a dying girls journalist father. Queen Latifah usually a welcome presence in any film shows up as a waitress who befriends Christy and Anna but their meet-cute at a restaurant doesnt ring true. It seems as though the character has been inserted into the story for a dose of humor but a dose of depth to go along with it would have helped. Its not giving away too much to reveal that a miracle will come along to rescue Anna but how that miracle transpires is quite unexpected. It would have been easy to get carried away with this plot development but director Patricia Riggen and screenwriter Randy Brown are careful not to overplay their hand -- a decision that works in the films favor. Indeed the emotional and spiritual core of this movie doesnt rest solely with the big miracle. The most important theme is rooted in the premise that everyday miracles surround us if only we pay attention. Thats an appealing message to people of all faiths. David Lewis is a Bay Area freelance writer. Miracles From Heaven Christian family drama. With Jennifer Garner Kylie Rogers Queen Latifah. Directed by Patricia Riggen. (PG. 109 minutes.)

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Early on when Miracles From Heaven is busy establishing its main characters warm openhearted regular-folks piety Texas mom Christy Beam (Jennifer Garner) goes around to each of her three daughters bedrooms for a ""prayer check."" She isnt just checking to make sure theyve said their prayers (though she is doing that); she also asks them to share one prayer each with her. This sequence is probably also intended to provide a glimpse into the characters of Abbie (Brighton Sharbino) Anna (Kylie Rogers) and Adelynn (Courtney Fansler) but theres something slightly pushy and overeager about the movies use of this strategy just as Christys request feels both like motherly involvement and a security checkpoint.Maybe the movie provides that checkpoint for the courtesy of general audiences. Movies like Miracles From Heaven Sonys would-be successor to its heaven-proving blockbuster Heaven Is For Real arent intended for cynical consumption and thats fine. The problem is that theyre barely intended to be movies at all. Stories that lead inextricably toward divine intervention dont have a lot of options other than killing time. Any real character shading or cinematic style beyond holy golden light might undermine the movies objective reality that God exists heaven is real and miracles happen. It is after all based on a true story.And so Miracles From Heaven proceeds with the hour-plus of setup leading to a little girl falling into a tree. Opening with narration just a few degrees shy of explaining how Websters dictionary defines the word ""miracle"" the movie spends just enough time with the Beam family to register token sadness when middle daughter Anna is diagnosed with a rare intestinal disorder--that is after protective supermom Christy shouts down several young foolish doctors and successfully wrangles an older and therefore wiser doctor capable of seeing that Anna isnt just suffering from lactose intolerance. Anna begins treatment living in near-constant pain only able to eat from a tube and never out of danger. As Christy fights for better care she begins to question her faith. How could a truly loving God (played here by a patch of clouds in the beautiful blue sky) allow her daughter to suffer this way? (The existence of other miscellaneous worldwide suffering had apparently never registered with her.)To describe the various other bits of plot business that lead up to the movies key event--Anna falls into a large hollow tree hits her head hard and regains consciousness cured of her disorder--would synopsize almost the entire movie. In fact Annas fall should constitute a spoiler as a detailed description of something that happens half an hour or so before the movie ends normally would. But the accident is the movies entire reason for being fully summarized in the films trailers. So Miracles From Heaven is stuck pretending its a normal watchable movie where important or at least entertaining things happen before the 75-minute mark. When Christy and Anna interrupt an impromptu doctor-soliciting trip to Boston to interact with a kind and mildly zany Queen Latifah character who befriends them and takes them on a stock-footage tour of the city it seems to be out of some deference to the idea that movies have supporting characters sometimes played by famous actors.The unifying pre-miracle story is supposed to be Christys crisis of faith most clearly demonstrated in a scene where her husband (Martin Henderson) looks chilled by her refusal to take his ""itll all work out"" as an answer to impending financial health and family woes. Beyond any religious considerations a successful and talented actor like Garner might be drawn to this material because it offers a conflicted leading role for a woman over 40. Miracles From Heaven is too dramatically inert to oblige Garner with a great character but it does offer plenty of tearful monologues and mini-monologues at least one pleading for doctors to help her daughter one where she questions her faith and one finally about the miracles that surround us every day. In addition to a tear-duct endurance challenge for the actors that last monologue seems like an olive branch to the less dogmatic members of the audience; if you dont buy a medical oddity as a straight-from-God miracle surely you can at least acknowledge the miraculous nature of human kindness.The human part proves tricky though. The angelic Anna never once registers as a person; no matter how many times she mentions her single would-be quirk (shes interested in Paris) she remains intestinal-distress fodder and eventually kind of a smug little moppet sanguine in her faith even as she approaches deaths door. Her late-movie revelation to her parents about her visit to heaven--which attempts to evoke Monet but quickly turns into the most Lisa Frank afterlife since The Lovely Bones--has the calculated poise of a press conference. It feels especially like spin given that a doctor in the movie actually offers a potential (albeit extremely vague) medical reason for Annas recovery.Spun or not Miracles From Heaven has its audience and that audience will likely be satisfied by its grab-bag imitation of a satisfying narrative (though even that audience might wonder why the movie has to run closer to two hours than 90 minutes). Its like a comic book movie heaped with too much nerdy mythology for a streamlined story with the distinction that some comic book movies sometimes have exciting action sequences. Sony ""the studio that brought you Heaven Is For Real"" might have done well to just admit that it has a franchise on its hands and affixed Miracles From Heaven with a post-credits scene of Colton Burpo turning up to invite Anna to join the heaven truthers.

TWITTER 3/16/2016 Jennifer Garner toplines a drama about family and faith that may actually be able to preach beyond the choir. The inspirational memoir Miracles From Heaven transfers to the big screen as a wholesome crowd-pleasing drama one whose subject is faith and gratitude. The tone is frequently more searching than self-satisfied and the harrowing medical crisis that drives the family story gives it the nonreligious urgency to preach beyond the choir. So too does Jennifer Garners down-to-earth lead performance as Christy Beam a ferociously dedicated mom doing her best to keep it together in trying circumstances. Churchy but not too churchy with only a couple of outright mentions of Jesus and just a soupcon of condescension toward those who Dont Believe this is in some ways basic New Age-friendly self-help delivered through a high-stakes narrative. Opening midweek to get a jump on Easter break family audiences (though the storys medical aspects might be disturbing to young children) the Columbia release looks primed for a celebratory box-office bow much like its producing teams previous faith-based release Heaven Is for Real. Working with a better script (by Randy Brown) than she had for The 33 director Patricia Riggen taps into the same sense of spiritual wonder that characterized some of the earlier movies more potent moments. But in this case she and her regular d.p. (and husband) Checco Varese cast the visions of awe in a pastel palette that reflects a childs point of view. Theres the awe-tinged light of an aquarium perfect cumulus clouds and storybook trees one of which will figure prominently in the story. Most effective theres the partly animated climactic sequence that expresses a young girls experience of heaven. That girl is Anna Beam a wise-beyond-her-years 10-year-old Texan whos exceptionally well played by Kylie Rogers. As her parents Garner and Martin Henderson have the down-home all-American air of a former homecoming king and queen who are devoted to their three girls. Kevin has just opened a veterinary clinic leaving them financially strapped and Christy stressed about it while he only shrugs his sturdy trust-in-God shoulders. Hes a rock and a somewhat blank one. What he calls his faith others would classify as what-me-worry nonchalance and its easy to understand why Christy loses her faith for a while especially after Anna their middle daughter becomes desperately ill. But Christy never loses her sense of purpose or tenacity. She refuses to accept glib diagnoses of lactose intolerance and acid reflux for Anna whos in constant pain her stomach distended. Pushing for real answers she gets them and theyre devastating Anna has a rare and incurable intestinal disorder that makes it impossible to digest food. Set against the fluorescent chill of emergency rooms Garners fury is a force of nature but never over the top. Riggen and Varese signal the terror of the situation through shots of empty hospital corridors -- a harsh contrast to the warmth of the Beams white clapboard house. (In both cases David R. Sandefurs production design is effectively low-key.) Refusing to sit patiently on the months-long waiting list of Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez) a leading specialist at Boston Childrens Hospital Christy flies cross-country with Anna where the kindness of strangers -- and an experimental drug -- offer hope. Brown (Trouble With the Curve) provides obvious comic relief in the aptly named Angela (Queen Latifah) a Boston waitress who takes Christy and Anna under her wing. Latifahs unfussy turn as the spunky good Samaritan almost saves her scenes from being cloying though her presence in the story feels truncated some of it sliced and diced into an unfortunate and mildly cheesy montage. The screenplay is at its weakest in the Boston sequences and Riggen has a tendency to push too hard. A hospital pillow fight is an especially unconvincing stab at laughter-through-the-tears. Lovely at first but quickly overstated is Annas communion with a Monet canvas at a Boston museum a moment abetted by Carlo Siliottos swelling score which is more effective in its darker suspenseful passages than when its plucking heartstrings. Derbez is by contrast successful at conveying Nurkos combination of serious physician and performing clown for his young patients. With Christy and Annas regular follow-up trips to Boston the story sidelines Kevin 13-year-old athlete Abbie (Brighton Sharbino) and Taylor Swift-adoring 6-year-old Adelynn (Courtney Fansler). The movie is essentially concerned with the relationship between Christy and Anna whose special bond is signaled in their first scene together. Though Rogers must deliver some of the screenplays smuggest and most cringeworthy lines her performance is emotionally compelling. And its hard to imagine another Hollywood star who would be as persuasive as Texas native Garner is in this change-of-pace role. That Christys spiritual well-being rests on her return to church is one of the key places where the films potentially broad appeal narrows -- even if that church features lively rock numbers (performed by Christian band Third Day) and a relatively nonjudgmental pastor (John Carroll Lynch). Beam and the filmmakers interpret Annas sudden recovery when it arrives as proof of God and they emphasize the inadequacy of science to explain. Among those who trust reason over faith theyre not likely to change any minds but they could touch a few hearts.

Related links Miracles premiere in Burleson shines spotlight on Beam family Director Patricia Riggen makes mark with Miracles from Heaven Miracles From Heaven takes Burleson familys story to Hollywood By Maricar Estrelladfw.comPosted 552pm on Tuesday Mar. 15 2016 Tuesday Mar. 15 2016 Saturday Mar. 19 2016 By Maricar Estrella Fort Worth Star-Telegram There comes a time in every familys life when something happens to test the limits of their love. For the Beams the test came when their middle daughter Anna was stricken with two rare and devastating digestive disorders. The Burleson familys story has been well-documented in media reports and the 2015 book Miracles From Heaven penned by Annas mom Christy Beam.For the uninitiated heres the spoiler alert In December 2011 Anna fell headfirst into a hollow cottonwood tree. After a six-hour rescue she came away unscathed no broken bones no injuries and seemingly healed from the disorders that afflicted her. The girl later told the story of meeting God in heaven who told her ""You have to go back Anna. Its not your time."" The film adaptation tells the true-life tale of the Beams with such intensity and urgency that a box of tissues may not be enough to keep up with the water works.The movie introduces us to the seemingly idyllic world of the Beams pre-diagnosis. The churchgoing family owns a sprawling Burleson property filled with dogs cows and green pastures. While husband Kevin ( Martin Henderson) prepares to open a veterinary clinic mom Christy ( Jennifer Garner) runs the show at home keeping track of their three daughters Abbie ( Brighton Sharbino) Anna ( Kylie Rogers) and Adelynn ( Courtney Fansler). She even micromanages bedtime prayers by asking each girl what they prayed about.When Anna short for Annabel begins to show symptoms of what would later be diagnosed as pseudo-obstruction motility disorder and antral hypomotility disorder the familys life is turned upside down. Along the way the family gets much-needed support from a Boston waitress ( Queen Latifah) who provides comic relief in the tense storyline and a kind and cooky expert physician Dr. Samuel Nurko (a delightful Eugenio Derbez).Director Patricia Riggen is no stranger to based-on-a-true-story cinema. She most recently helmed The 33 about the 2010 Chilean mining accident.In Miracles Riggen keeps the pace of the film intense allowing the tale to unfold chronologically so the audience feels the ebb and flow of a family in crisis. The story also gives a balanced interpretation of faith. Faith isnt a commitment but a struggle. And the struggle is real for the Beam family which is evident by Garners nuanced emotional portrayal of the matriarchs roller-coaster ride with religion. Garner told the Star-Telegram in a recent interview that she didnt ""see it as a faith-based film.""""Its about family that drew from faith in their life. ... This is something that gets them through this"" Garner said.And yet it is fairly evident that this is a faith-based film. It is co-produced by Dallas pastor T.D. Jakes and Franklin Entertainment which previously released 2014s Heaven Is for Real. Major moments in the film are set in church and even little Annas middle name is fittingly Faith.Those who may be turned off by a faith-based film should keep an open mind and heart.Theres a pivotal moment in the movie and the book when Anna (played with such maturity by Rogers) is fraught with unspeakable pain and tells her mother ""I just want to die."" Its a moment that hits hard to anyone who has ever held a loved ones hand in a hospital. In a 2015 Star-Telegram interview Christy Beam said ""Every parent can relate even if their child doesnt have a chronic illness because theres always some kind of struggle that requires courage and faith.""Whether you are a believer or a not theres no denying the power of a familys love.

Updated July 30 2016  553 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews A mothers faith is tested in Miracles From Heaven By Jake Coyle Associated Press Mar 15 2016 (...) The rise of the so-called ""faith-based film"" -- typically low-budget films that are almost uniformly evangelical -- has occurred largely in a bubble of its own like a sheltering harbor for Christian believers at that heathen meeting place the multiplex.""Miracles From Heaven"" a film whose title even Hallmark would blush at is an attempt to expand the reach of the faith-based film a little beyond the flock. To do so it has armed itself with two things the star power of Jennifer Garner and a full barrage of sentimentality. The fate of a sick 10-year-old girl precariously hangs in the balance.The film directed by Patricia Riggen (""The 33"") is adapted from the memoir of Christy Beam whose Texas family is jolted when one of their three daughters Anna (played sweetly by Kylie Rogers) is found to suffer from a rare disorder that leaves her chronically unable to digest food. ""Based on real events"" is how the film presents itself and some of its best qualities are in depicting elements of life -- the frightful anxiety of parenthood the struggle to find meaning amid hardship -- that dont often make it into the movies.But the course of ""Miracles From Heaven"" is never in doubt. When Garner as Beam intones in the opening voiceover questions of where miracles come from the films title has already stated the answer. Just as certainly will it turn out well in the end for Christy who strays from her faith while watching her daughters belly painfully swell and Anna whose health deteriorates while the family desperately searches for a knowing doctor.For those girding for religious propaganda that is here. And the Beams -- a white churchgoing flannel-shirt-wearing Texas family with horses on their pastoral homespun ranch -- offer little that deviates from the most stereotyped limited view of whos Christian.But to the films credit its more distinguishing characteristic is an earnestness to recognize the small and large gestures of kindness that alter lives. Its not the most radical epiphany but in ""Miracles From Heaven"" it feels genuine. Garner is of course a better performer than many of these films have had and her white-knuckle maternal worry propels the movie to something a touch better than the Lifetime movie youd expect. Several years after ""Dallas Buyers Club"" Garner is back in hospital halls this time as a pleading parent of a patient. Along the way a handful of people brighten Annas journey a playful doctor (Eugenio Derbez) an exuberantly friendly waitress (Queen Latifah incredulously playing a Bostonian) a thoughtful boy at school.""Miracles are everywhere"" is the movies concluding ethos something that might also be said of Terrence Malicks bursting-with-life films the latest of which was his LA version of the prodigal son tale ""Knight of Cups."" The connection between radically different elevations of moviemaking is maybe a little silly.But its a reminder that just as ""miracles"" are all around spirituality in the cinema is too and it should be sought out in films that exceed the narrow boundaries of ""faith-based.""What ""Miracles From Heaven""  Two stars out of four  Run time 149  Rating PG  Content Thematic material including accident and medical images Tags Miracles From Heaven Jennifer Garner View (...) comments Most popular Old Standard Fried Chicken will close this weekend Smash-and-grab burglars hit original Sweetie Pies location in Dellwood Mellow Mushroom pizzeria opens in Sunset Hills Half-century-old Webster Groves Bookshop is closing Today in Pokemon Go Shootout in Vegas security risk in Israel finding Yuri in Russia Latest Disney movies help autistic boy find his voice in Life Animated Woody Allens Cafe Society is a bittersweet treat A trio of misfit mothers lose control in Bad Moms Jason Bourne is back doing what he does best Eat That Question taps into Frank Zappa Quick links Comics/games Movie times Pop off forum Reel Time movie forum TV listings The Blender Tube Talk Sign up For Go Sneak Peek Pick up this Sundays paper for the Craft Beer Special Section Get your tickets for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Arts + Craft Brewfest See ads from todays newspaper Manage your services Feast Magazine Ladue News St. Louis Best Bridal STL High School Sports Products and features Apps Archives Calendar Chats Comics amp; games Contests E-edition Forums Newsletters Our events Press releases Tools and services Advertise with us Autos Classifieds Contact us Homes Jobs Newspapers in Education Page reprints Post-Dispatch store Site help Subscriber services (c) Copyright 2016 STLtoday.com 900 N.

"Miracles From Heaven Review Jennifer Garners Faith-Based True Story | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Miracles From Heaven Geoff Berkshire Associate Editor Features geoffberkshire 28 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Sony March 15 2016 | 0300PM PT Jennifer Garner carries a faith-based successor to sleeper hit Heaven Is for Real. The very premise of ""Miracles From Heaven"" offers an argument against its own existence. If there are miracles everywhere we look who wants to waste time on a movie this middling? Not that faith-based audiences will object to the unapologetic manipulations in such an innocuous slice of inspirational hokum especially when its served up with the utmost sincerity. Instead the frequently fickle crowd should turn out in droves for a pic thats a spiritual successor in every way to 2014s sleeper hit ""Heaven Is for Real."" This similarly ""based on a true story"" tale of a child who claims to have visited heaven and lived to share the good news looks perfectly poised for a blessed run at the box office during the same Easter-season window. Helmer Patricia Riggens pic (arriving months after her previous film ""The 33"") may be preaching to the choir but those unlikely to sing along werent going to show up anyway. With that in mind its almost surprising that ""Miracles From Heaven"" takes any risks at all. From a blunt acknowledgement of the holier-than-thou attitudes of certain churchgoers to a sustained focus on a womans crisis of faith throughout her childs life-threatening battle with a rare illness the film isnt all homilies and hallelujahs. Although theres plenty of that too. Scribe Randy Browns adaptation is based on the memoir of Texas mother-of-three Christy Beam (played by Jennifer Garner) whose daughter Annabel (Kylie Rogers) developed chronic stomach problems as a preteen was ultimately diagnosed with an intestinal motility disorder and nearly died. While Christys veterinarian husband Kevin (Martin Henderson) and their other two daughters -- the eldest Abbie (Brighton Sharbino) and the precocious youngest Adelynn (Courtney Fansler) -- did what they could to support Annabel its Christy who labors endlessly to find a way to save her daughters life. Even if it means temporarily relocating to Boston and crashing the office of sought-after specialist Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez like a less cloying Patch Adams) without an appointment. Christys fierce commitment to Annabel becomes the films backbone and its a credit that the bulk of the running time is spent grappling with Annabels illness and the hopelessness that overtakes both mother and daughter. Getting the appropriate diagnosis was enough of an ordeal but learning from Dr. Nurko that there is no cure pushes the family to the brink and causes Christy to back away from her formerly unshakeable faith. In a welcome gender reversal from the father-son dynamic of ""Heaven Is for Real"" Garner and Rogers deliver fully committed performances that credibly convey the physical and mental anguish endured by sick children and their caregivers. This is standard disease-of-the-week telepic stuff (and Riggens blandly antiseptic visual approach can hardly be dubbed cinematic) but rendered with enough detail to practically qualify as a horror movie for parents. As Annabels crippling pain takes its own toll on Christy the film raises inevitable questions about Gods plans and what happens when a child loses her will to live. (After all if heaven is waiting for real why endure unthinkable misery?) But eventually ""Miracles From Heaven"" gets around to its big miracle Annabels spontaneous remission a development with no medical explanation after she suffers a terrifying fall into the center of a hollow cottonwood (convincingly reproduced by production designer David R. Sandefur) in the familys backyard. The disappearance of her disease shocks everyone but its Annabels gentle insistence that she took an out-of-body trip to heaven (depicted via visual effects somewhere between Peter Jacksons garish ""The Lovely Bones"" and a Monet painting that captivates Annabel in a Boston museum) when she was unconscious that firmly reconnects Christy with her Christianity. The whole ordeal is wrapped up in a bow when kindly Pastor Scott (an underused John Carroll Lynch) invites Christy to speak during church where she delivers a quote dubiously attributed to Einstein (""There are only two ways to live your life. One as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle"") and a nonbelieving journalist (Wayne Pere) whose own daughter shared a hospital room with Annabel springs to Christys defense after an outburst from a skeptical parishioner. Cue the slow clap-turned-standing ovation crescendo. It would be enough to make auds choke on sentimentality if only that werent the reason they bought a ticket in the first place. In a move to underline the storys bona fides the pic closes with footage of the actual Beam family happily at home. Seeing their smiling faces after everything weve witnessed may not prove the existence of miracles but its sure to galvanize true believers to spread the word and boost the bottom line.

Ashley P. says July 21 2016 at 1020 am I was very surprised by the acting skills by all the actors...not just by the big stars but the lesser known as well. The movie was very touchy and me and my husband really enjoyed it. I pray that the critic will experience the love of God and know that miracles do exist. I pray that your heart will be forever changed. Be blessed. Reply carol says July 17 2016 at 434 pm I feel your editor is anti-Christian. Perhaps if I was uneducated and unable to make my own decisions I would take his word. I ask the question who wouldnt want to see a movie that gives us hope and shows us the love of a family? Do we not have enough garbage thrown at us each day that we deserve to believe? Dare to have hope? Reply Mac White says June 3 2016 at 1004 pm This movie was amazing and for all the people who are critisising it you should realize that if this was your daughter or son you would be devastated. so stop posting all of these mean comments because you never know what can happen inyour life it just might come and bite you in the butt. Reply Janine Rozelle says April 10 2016 at 945 pm Great Movie - GOD is Awesome  Reply Dennis Davis says April 9 2016 at 143 pm This critic is extremely bias and it shows if you cant deliver an unbiased report then its time to find another line of work Reply Cheryl Crowe Junkin says April 8 2016 at 830 pm This was an awesome movie and I enjoyed it very much. The critic who wrote this will someday meet our God and it may be too late for him to believe in miracles. I pray for his soul. This movie had NO foul language or references and it was a pleasure to sit through. The message of miracles needs to be widened to open the eyes of non-believers The doctor in this movie was also wonderful we need more doctors like him. Reply Debra Seiling says April 4 2016 at 1124 am Miracles From Heaven was an inspiring true story. In addition to being grateful that this little girl was miraculously healed this movie helps us see that we need to trust the instincts that Christ gives us. We need to be prayerful about being open to assist others when led so God can do miracles in the lives of others. Reply Ron Swaim says April 2 2016 at 433 pm If it had been about an atheist or global warming you would have given it 100%. The media is out of control. Reply Barry Burchfield says March 27 2016 at 829 am After reading this review I find myself surprised not at all by the critics loathing of anything related to decency and his condescending attitude toward people of faith. Simply put he reminds me of the character who lost his daughter to cancer while talking to the mother in the hall of the hospital. He was polite but preferred that the daughter not fill his daughters head with false hope. His alternative is no hope. Ill cling to my ""false one"". Im not angered by you I pity you. Reply RC says March 23 2016 at 702 am I understand being a critic but it feels that this reporter is giving us his feeling on religion. I didnt think reporters were suppose to write based on their own feelings. Keep your feelings and religious views out of your story. Reply D. Wilkins says March 22 2016 at 1149 am So sorry this critic feels this movie is middling and people shouldnt waste their time seeing it ""IF miracles happen all the time"". Does he realize he himself is a miracle? Every bone in his body every body part functioning so he can live and breathe He should thank God everyday. Would he rather watch our politicians argue and act like 4 year olds? My opinion seeing hope instead helplessness is better. Reply timothy bradberry says March 22 2016 at 754 am If you listen to the critics the only movies youll be seeing are the ones that only connect with their out of touch with reality lives I choose to believe in God and that life is a miracle from birth to death and the choices I make in it shall affect me eternally I choose grace and salvation from my LORD. Reply Zulaika Reyes says March 25 2016 at 459 pm I believe in God who is are father hope and savior. and my ever thing. Some time I dont follow what he want because of the evil earth we live on but praying to him makes my life a whole lot better. Amen Reply JM Kayne says March 20 2016 at 248 am Highly recommended  Reply resa scott tusa says March 19 2016 at 1115 pm Believe in god and Faith.resa Reply Kat says March 19 2016 at 1009 pm Believers will understand and appreciate this movie. I need to say nothing else. Reply Earl Gibbs says March 18 2016 at 159 pm ""Miracles from Heaven"" is a great film. Im grateful that the Beam family had the courage to share a very personal and sacred experience with the world. It is my belief that some are allowed or commanded by God to return to mortality after passing through the portal of death for the express purpose of inspiring hope and faith in seekers of truth. Reply kathym says March 16 2016 at 415 pm Saw it this afternoon very worth watching. Theater was packed and not a dry eye in it Reply Connie McGuire says March 16 2016 at 1258 pm I love this movie - didnt expect that good Reply justahunch says March 16 2016 at 1014 am You couldnt pay me to see this. Well actually that might cause me to see it if the figure was good enough. Reply Fay says March 16 2016 at 943 am Saw this movie last night and it was the most awesome inspiring movie Ive seen in a long time in a world full of so much negativity I can only have good thoughts on this movie. Truly worth watching and I consider a must see. Reply artzylady says March 16 2016 at 715 am My reason for wanting to see this film is more about the medical miracle and not the heaven is for real aspect although I am a Christian. The hook that got me interested was how this child was cured after sustaining a head injury. How freaky is that? Ill admit sentimentality does play a role but that isnt the main reason Ill be buying a ticket to see this film as the author suggests. Reply RockyP.Johnson says March 16 2016 at 650 am Colton Burpo the boy from Heaven Is for Real says his story is true. It was someone else who has said that his own (different) story about dying and coming back wasnt actually true. Colton Burpos story didnt involve him dying; he had a near-death experience and he maintains he had a trip to Heaven during it. Interesting And a good film too. Reply Beau Martin says March 15 2016 at 728 pm This movie and story is NOT TRUE just like the last one where the little boy admitted it didnt happen... READ UR BIBLE AND U WILL UNDERSTAND WHY IT ISNT TRUE... Reply Dennis Davis says April 9 2016 at 156 pm Youre wrong it is based on a true story Reply D.b.bury says June 6 2016 at 150 pm Dennis how do you know its true? Pure speculation.if you read any of apostle Pauls epistles an study youll know this is impossible.satans work is visible if you wish hard enoughGods time is not our time would she be better off dying for heaven JJK says March 15 2016 at 604 pm JJ needs to do the Alias movie ASAP. I love Jennifer Garner more than I will ever love you know the man she was married to. Reply Artiewhitfox says March 15 2016 at 306 pm Dont people learn? Heaven needs to be in us. They will be like Jesus who is good to people. Saying die with a smile is not being good to a person.

Credit Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures Until it delivers an eye-rolling scene near the end ""Miracles From Heaven"" is an unexpectedly effective tear-jerker. More surprising still that late diversion doesnt negate much of the movies early sincerity.""Miracles From Heaven"" is based on ""the incredible true story"" of the Beam family. Anna (Kylie Rogers) the middle child of three daughters of Christy (Jennifer Garner) and Kevin (Martin Henderson) begins experiencing pain that worsens until the cause -- a rare and potentially fatal intestinal disorder -- is diagnosed.Christy proves to be a determined mother flying with Anna from their Texas home to implore a specialist in Boston to treat the girl. Yet despite Christys Christian faith -- the opening of the movie shows the Beams preparing for church -- she begins to doubt God as Annas condition worsens.Adapted by Randy Brown from Christy Beams memoir the film directed by Patricia Riggen focuses much more on the familys love and sacrifices than on its specific creed. Even scenes set in a church look to uplift viewers rather than convert them. The stresses of parenthood and illness are the main emphasis here and if the film follows the formula of an inoffensive Lifetime movie that works well enough to keep the tale perfectly watchable.Only near the end when Anna is found to be mysteriously cured after falling unconscious does the story veer toward the mawkish. Anna relates leaving her body and visiting a vague heaven (a scene thats sped through as if even the filmmakers had their doubts) leading Christy to deliver a final sermon on rediscovering faith.Ms. Garner remains dedicated throughout and a scene in which she begs a receptionist for help is especially heartfelt. Queen Latifah in a minor role as an implausibly friendly waitress offers the required comic relief. Whether the actresses believe the girls story I cant say. But they know how to act as though they do.

Of course in reality thats only part of the definition. Any unexplained welcome situation necessarily needs the person or people involved in the event itself to decide that its a miracle. This poses a problem for the cinematic retelling of a story that its author is convinced is miraculous. In fact its a problem facing almost all recent faith-based films; faith is an unseen force and film must give audiences something to see. ""Miracles From Heaven"" then qualifies as a success It delivers its miracle without strain. Also Read Hollywood Hallelujah Expect a Wave of Faith-Based Movies This Year Based on the memoir by Beam ""Miracles"" tells the story of young Anna Beam (Kylie Rogers ""Space Station 76"") whose unexplained digestive disorder leads Christy to battle with a variety of doctors and misdiagnoses. Confidently told that the situation is merely lactose intolerance or acid reflux Christy remains unconvinced. Anna vomits everything she eats and is in near-constant pain. Desperate for an answer the mother and daughter travel from Texas to Boston with Christy begging her way into seeing Dr. Samuel Nurko (Eugenio Derbez ""Jack and Jill"") a leading pediatric gastroenterologist. Once there Anna is diagnosed with intestinal motility disorder a paralysis of the G.I. tract a degenerative condition with no cure. Also Read 5 Takeaways From Jennifer Garners Vanity Fair Cover Story Driven away from church by fellow members who blame sin for the childs illness Christys doubts overwhelm her. ""I dont have faith in anything. I cant even pray"" she tells husband Kevin (Martin Henderson ""The Ring""). Anna too succumbs to hopelessness in one of the more honest depictions of childhood depression in recent mainstream film. A good-hearted pastor (John Carroll Lynch ""American Horror Story"") and waitress (Queen Latifah) intervene but nothing can solve the medical or spiritual crisis. Then comes the miracle of the title and it either happened that way or it did not. Thankfully thats mostly beside the point since much of the strength of this film lies in its reasonably restrained script from Randy Brown (""Trouble With the Curve"") which refuses to force itself onto skeptical viewers and its calm un-showy direction by Patricia Riggen (""The 33""). She makes only occasional moves into fluffy-cloud-based religious kitsch wisely focusing instead on human beings trapped between belief and despair. See Video SXSW Nicolas Cage Deeply Aware Hes an Internet Icon Almost none of the recent crop of faith-based movies would allow space for unresolved conflict between people of faith or give child characters the opportunity to discuss their own possible imminent deaths or to visually suggest that even the miracle promised by its title may have been a product of human imagination. ""Miracles"" allows for all of this setting itself apart from angry paranoid Christian films like ""Gods Not Dead"" and even from the much kinder yet still more sure-of-itself ""Heaven Is For Real."" Meanwhile the films real power comes from Garner whose solid memorable work anchors everything around her. Her anxiety spills into every frame she occupies as she demands answers worries about health insurance coverage and refuses to smile or stifle her anger. She is real and tough in ways her film work has seldom given her the chance to be. Shes the bridge the story needs to avoid being pigeonholed as another smug Evangelical advertisement and her performance elevates ""Miracles"" to a Christian film worthy of the name.
