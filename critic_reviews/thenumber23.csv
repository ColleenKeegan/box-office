"Number 23 Doesnt add up | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNumber 23 Doesnt add upThere are 23 letters in the phrase ""Joel Schumachers bad movie.""Fri. Feb. 23 2007  (out of 4)Starring Jim Carrey Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston. Directed by Joel Schumacher. 95 minutes. At major theatres.14A  Article Continued BelowThere are 23 letters in the phrase ""Joel Schumachers bad movie.""You might question this. Not the number of letters - I checked - but which bad Joel Schumacher movie I might be referring to. There are so many of them and the number is getting close to 23. Make sure you include The Phantom of the Opera and Batman amp; Robin in your count.The bad movie I refer to is The Number 23 his latest. Its a voodoo thriller starring Jim Carrey who plays a man who believes that the number 23 is out to get him. Why all those other numbers are leaving him alone is beyond me but 23 does seem to get up to all kinds of badness.Julius Caesar was stabbed 23 times. Charles Manson was born Nov. 12 (11 + 12 = 23). The Mayans believed the world would end on Dec. 23 2012 (20 + 1 + 2 = 23). My brother stole my pogo stick when I was 23 and broke it into 23 pieces.Okay so I lied about the pogo stick. But it makes about as much sense as this movie which is so dark and dense -Schumacher should never attempt noir - it looks like a convenience store camera shot it.Jim Carrey is an animal control officer named Walter Sparrow who runs afoul of an evil dog while on the job. The pooch causes him to be late for a date with his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen). While waiting she buys him a hand-bound novel called The Number 23. Its about a freaky gumshoe named Fingerling (also played by Carrey) who enjoys rough sex with a hottie named Fabrizia (also played by Madsen).While enjoying said rough sex Fingerling becomes obsessed with the number 23. It causes bad things to happen (see above regarding Caesar Manson Mayans and pogo stick). Sparrow spends the entire movie reading the novel. He is a very slow reader and an even slower thinker. Despite the helpful suggestion from Agatha and family friend Isaac (Danny Huston) that hes merely losing his marbles all 23 of them Sparrow insists hes about to 23 skidoo or worse. I think I became convinced this is a bad movie about 23 minutes into it.Scariest thing of all is that Carrey actually believes this stuff. Ive discovered something else. There are 23 letters in the phrase ""Jim Carrey needs quick help.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Number 23"" with Jim Carrey Virginia Madsen Logan Lerman Danny Huston. Directed by Joel Schumacher from a screenplay by Fernley Phillips. 95 minutes. Rated R for violence disturbing images sexuality and language. Several theaters. OK Im starting to get worried about Virginia Madsen. There she was so radiantly sane and lovely in ""Sideways"" not so very long ago and now here she is this weekend showing up at the multiplexes in two different movies married to two more-or-less insane men each time with a teenage son who has a bizarre name. In ""The Astronaut Farmer"" (review on page 21) shes Audie married to astronaut-wannabe Billy Bob Thornton with a kid named Shepard Farmer. Now in ""The Number 23"" shes Agatha (note the alliteration) the spouse of addled conspiracy nut Jim Carrey and their offspring is Robin Sparrow. What gives Virginia? Whats going on Virginias Agent? And what I shudder to ask is next? Steve Buscemi? A kid named Oscar Nomination? I mention all this mostly to avoid going into the mess that is ""The Number 23"" but it cant be helped Such is my lot as it is apparently Virginias lot to focus her loving wifely gaze on someone whos losing his grip. (For the record she does it very well but would somebody please give her a better role?) This incoherent psychological thriller directed by Joel Schumacher and written by first-timer Fernley Phillips is the tale of a regular guy named Walter Sparrow (Carrey) who becomes obsessed with a novel that appears to be telling the dark story of his own past. Along the way the authors obsession with the number 23 becomes Walters and were treated to a lot of examples of numbers that add up to 23 which means a lot of scenes in which people say things like ""Whats 14 plus 9? 23"" and look haunted. The novel a seemingly random birthday gift to Walter from Agatha comes to life as a film-within-the-film staged by Schumacher as a blood-drenched noir complete with corpses femmes fatale a weirdly bleached-out room in which everything seems draped in white sheets (what is it laundry day?) an evil dog named Ned and a fleabag hotel with ominous crimson stains on the wall. All of this is intercut with numerous scenes in the Sparrows very dark Craftsman home in which Walter acts bizarre and Agatha and Robin stare at him with familial concern backlit nicely against their homes blood-red walls. Hmmm. This territory is certainly a stretch for Carrey; however in this case it probably would have been better to atrophy. Disguised in Tom Cruise bangs and perpetual stubble he throws himself into the role and gives an earnest hardworking performance; hes not at all bad but the baggage he carries from his comic performances is all too apparent. Many of Walters lines come off as funny but you sense they werent intended that way. ""The Number 23"" soon dissolves into incoherence with seemingly random scenes (Agatha in some weird red cave Ned the dog turning up everywhere The Steps to Heaven) that just add up to confusion. Schumacher directs with his usual heavy hand letting the images fly by as ponderous music plays. At one point Carrey says ""Ill be honest. I didnt get it."" At last something on which we can agree.

Starring Jim Carrey Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston. Directed by Joel Schumacher. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Number 23"" weighs in at a lean mean 95 minutes. It wastes no time getting started and once its going it keeps going providing no long discursive conversation that might allow for a popcorn or restroom run. Take care of those details before walking into the theater -- and then buckle up and get ready for a ride. [Podcast Mick LaSalle on Number 23 Days of Glory Amazing Grace.] Other filmmakers would do well to learn from the economy with which director Joel Schumacher and screenwriter Fernley Phillips approach this material. ""The Number 23"" juggles two stories -- one in the real world the other a parallel story from a novel that the protagonist is reading. The juggling is accomplished elegantly in both senses of the term -- with concision and also with stylistic elan. The movie looks terrific and though it always keeps moving it never feels headlong or rushed. This is a very good movie that could have been better still Alas the denouement is just a little off. This is not to say that ""The Number 23"" eventually falls apart -- it never comes close -- but it does have a finish that depends too much on coincidence and it resolves in a way that the script itself curiously enough admits is not quite satisfying. No more can be said to someone who hasnt yet seen it except to add that the resolution doesnt exactly strike. It just sets viewers up for a grand slam and then scores on a bunt single. It tells the story of a fellow who becomes obsessed with the number 23. Its an obsession that comes virtually out of nowhere. Jim Carrey plays a seemingly happy-go-lucky dogcatcher and the only hint that theres something askew about him is his constant stubble and a bad haircut that suggests a man without a woman in his life. In fact hes married to a nice lady played by Virginia Madsen. With ""The Number 23"" Madsens place in the current cinema becomes clear. After an early career of playing temptresses she has now in the wake of ""Sideways"" become the actress who can make you believe she loves anybody. Take some whacked-out character who looks like he slept in his clothes and Madsen has enough warmth to make you think she not only loves him but maybe even loves him because hes a wreck. Unfortunately this nice wife happens to pick up the wrong novel in a used bookstore about a detective who sees 23 everywhere and believes the number is out to get him. She gives the novel to her husband to read and he starts seeing weird parallels between himself and the detective in the story. And -- no surprise -- he starts developing his own obsession with 23. You might too. ""The Number 23"" has a nutty insistence about it that could inspire paranoia in latent cases. Even the healthiest among us will within 23 hours or so of seeing the movie start adding up addresses and birthdays to see if they come out to ... that number. Schumacher does something interesting with the pictures look. In the beginning the real world is brightly lit and the world of the novel -- introduced in an artful and thoroughly impossible (computer-generated) tracking shot -- is dark and noirish. And then subtly as the film progresses the two worlds start looking alike. Of course this parallels the change in our heros consciousness as he transforms from a most happy fellow to a driven paranoid fanatic. ""The Number 23"" makes good use of Carreys glib but distant quality that friendly but unknowable essence that hints at something tortured and out of control behind the smile. Yet surprisingly the one element that he doesnt quite manage to rope in here is a sinister vibe. Watching Carrey its easy to believe hes nuts but something benign within him makes it difficult to see him as potentially evil. Still this is a quibble. Carrey owns this movie. Hes in virtually every scene and theres no taking ones eyes from him. -- Advisory This film contains blood violence and shocking images.

Photo New Line Cinema The Number 23 1 / 2 Back to Gallery To refute The Number 23s numbing numerology I predict it wont finish 23rd at this weekends box office. But it could come close. How do we loathe thee The Number 23? Let us count the ways. For starters an initially intriguing concept never adds up. Dogcatcher Walt Sparrow (Jim Carrey) finds a battered book called The Number 23 and is consumed by it. The story not only strangely echoes his life but also suddenly warps it. Everything it seems adds divides subtracts or multiplies into some form of 23 or 32 or something. Whichever. Those two numbers signal dread and doom and Sparrow cant stop thinking about them or seeing them everywhere. This leads him to try what people routinely do in movies and TV but rarely attempt in real life become an amateur detective. Hot on the case of a mysterious murder Sparrow digs up clues -- and even a grave -- with help from his gung-ho son (Logan Lerman). Is Sparrow fated to follow the books Fingerling a pulpish detective whose steamy sex life and violent bent Carrey also plays in dreamlike scenes unveiled while he reads? Or does the number have ""no magical meaning"" as Sparrows wife (Virginia Madsen) sensibly asserts? By the end its hard to tell given the films hopeless fragmentation obtuse plot uneven tone and slap-happy styles from director Joel Schumacher. Yes Schumacher -- the man who turned the Batman franchise into a goofy homoerotic fantasy and who bombed in his last outing with The Phantom of the Opera. He did direct taut thriller Phone Booth so its not like he lacked a clue here. But rather than boosting suspense he indulges in nonsense changing film stocks washing out scenes and overplaying the edgy computer tricks. For a film that tries melding David Finchers grimness to David Lynchs creepiness The Number 23 is an empty hybrid of slow-go horror. Its casting problems start with No. 1. Carrey bless him still fights a battle he never may win to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor. A comic sense is ingrained in his hard-drive -- and our conditioning. That doesnt hurt him when hes playing a bored everyman who finds a book. But when things get serious Carrey cant keep up. Even a big moment -- when the sinister dog hounding Sparrow pops up in front of his car -- is riddled with inadvertent mirth. Aside from one large surprise and some jolting imagery this alleged thriller lacks punch. A dogcatcher starts obsessively counting numbers and goes wacko. So what? Have I reached 23 reasons for disliking the film? Not yet? No matter. None of this adds up anyway. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Bushnell Off Trail GPS for 29 + free shipping Husky Stubby 45-Piece Wrench / Socket Set for 15 + pickup at...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post One thing for sure no one reads a page-turner as slowly as Jim Carreys character in ""The Number 23."" After a series of coincidences set in motion by a burly dog named Ned Walter Sparrow an animal-control worker is late to meet his wife Agatha. So she waits browsing a used-book store called a Novel Fate. There Agatha (Virginia Madsen) finds a red-bound copy of a detective novel she thinks Walter might like. His initial response is the sort of rebuke that ensures a comeuppance. ""Why should I have some writer fill my head with nonsense?"" he quips. ""Ill wait for the movie."" For audiences who like their thrillers dank with the smell of red herrings the movie is nearly worth the wait. As for Walter not only does the tattered copy of ""The Number 23"" draw the happily married father into a noirish story about a detective named Fingerling his femme fatale lover and a blond bent on suicide the book torments Walter with echoes of his own life. Paranoia and conspiracy theories come from an overaccumulation of meaning. Soon Walters not chasing down the number but being harassed by it menaced by it. For several weeks the distributor of this film has had its local publicists send reviewers e-mail missives with headers like ""Feds charge 23 in ecstasy marijuana ring"" ""N.Y. fire forces 23 from apartment"" ""Father charged in freezing death of 23-month-old girl"" and so forth. For a brief time it was clever. Then spooky-kooky became annoying. The easy revenge now would be to give you 23 reasons to avoid the movie. But much of ""The Number 23"" directed by Joel Schumacher is compelling. Fingerlings world is not unlike other dark provinces Schumacher (""8mm"" ""Flatliners"") has escorted us to. And cinematographer Matthew Labatique textures Fingerlings world with shadow and grain a blurring of night and daylight noir and our daily lives. Newcomer Fernley Phillips screenplay eventually binds itself into too tight a knot. But it also has some admirable ambitions about family responsibility memory. The movie hints at the different ways books and movies burrow into our imaginations. Books put voices in readers heads mix up our pronouns. Recounting Chapter Five Walter substitutes ""I"" for Fingerling. When did the pronoun shift in identification occur? Like many readers might Walter populates Fingerlings account with images of himself and the folks in his life. He even recasts Agatha as sex-and- death-courting fatale Fabrizia. Is this overidentification simply a husband and dads way of exploring fugitive desires or something more dangerous? ""The Number 23"" proves movies arent the only things that tempt sequels. Actors take on projects that reprise particularly successful roles. Think of these films as personal sequels. (Jodie Fosters ""Panic Room"" and ""Flight Plan"" for instance.) With its psychological convolutions and a likable protagonist ""The Number 23"" feels like a version of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" the wondrously gnarled romantic drama by Charlie Kaufman. The novel in the movie was penned by one Topsy Kretts. That ridiculously literal pseudonym alone would have most of us tossing the paperback into the remainder pile. But doesnt it sound a lot like Lemony Snicket? A number of Carrey vehicles seem referenced here. Although the actor delivers a smirk-free turn whenever Walter declares - and he does often - ""Im not a detective"" you want to yell back at the screen ""No youre a pet detective"" As the movie pursues its final revelations the narrative knots begin to to wear thin. That is an unfortunate event. A thriller should never become a Houdini act in which our interest is solely in seeing the filmmakers escape the narrative binds with which theyve trussed their tale.

"Suspense rhythm never equates to The Number 23 - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Cracked beyond repair Unthrilling thriller Number 23 is seriously flawed By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 23 2007 The only fright in the nominal thriller ""The Number 23"" is how shaggy gaunt and wiped out Jim Carrey looks. Standing around in too many scenes wearing a white tank top with tattoos on his back and a saxophone in his hands he could be auditioning for a film about Iggy Pops unknown jazz years.Carrey plays Walter Sparrow a dogcatcher who suffers from ""graphomania"" and numerological compulsion. This means he spends the whole movie keyed up over the number 23 scribbling equations and formulas everywhere including on his own body and his own home. Alas the writing is quite literally on the wall and its complete gibberish.Walter narrates the events that transpire after his all-too-patient wife a baker named Agatha (Virginia Madsen) introduces him to the James M. Cain-lite ""novel of obsession"" that shares its title with the movie. The pedestrian vaguely queasy prose (""You can call me Fingerling"") obsesses both the dogcatcher and director Joel Schumacher who gives us gauzy reenactments of the books pulpy noirish doings.They feature Walter as the detective Fingerling investigating murder and more and Agatha in a black wig playing a whorish Italian named Fabrizia. Whorishness being this books stock in trade theres another sexpot (Lynn Collins). She exposes the detective (I cant type that name again) to her own paranoia over the number 23.Shes called Suicide Blonde like the old hit INXS song only you cant dance to her. Indeed the names in this film seem to be a parody of symbolism. A case in point Walters teen son is called Robin Sparrow.For Walter the books numeric paranoia is contagious and he cant stop 23-ing. The movie follows crazily along delivering psychopathology reminiscent of ""The Shining"" montages straight out of recent bargain-basement horror not to mention a random shot of ""Dogs Playing Poker."" (If youre truly interested in the cinema of numeric affliction and writing on the body skip this movie and try the films of Peter Greenaway.)Its depressing to see Carrey go in so deeply for this sort of claptrap the way he does in the preposterous climax which is like an unwelcome riff on sequences from ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Incidentally ""23"" does inspire longing for the memory-purging services in that movie.First-time screenwriter Fernley Phillips is the mind behind this thriller. And his script seems to have sprung from the same writers workshop that gave us last years ""Stranger Than Fiction"" which also featured a paranoid sap the lady baker in his life a work of dubious literature some unconvincing analysis of said literature the bogus use of a musical instrument as a prop an anonymous urban setting and several aggravating ideas about destiny as culminating in the rush on an oncoming city bus.""The Number 23"" is the sleazier movie. But the lurid is all that really seems to interest Schumacher anymore. Hes never been much of a filmmaker and ""23"" has no real rhythm or suspense. Like a bad music video (which is to say like most of Schumachers movies) the whole thing is production design and runaway editing. Yet his prolific career has lasted three decades.Focused on a sort of pop youth movie he gave us his best stuff in the 1980s and very early 90s (""St. Elmos Fire"" ""The Lost Boys"" ""Flatliners"") but never outgrew the slickness of that era refusing to put his style to any penetrating use. So nearly everything he touched -- ""Batman Forever"" ""Batman amp; Robin"" ""8MM"" ""Flawless"" ""Bad Company"" ""Phone Booth"" ""The Phantom of the Opera"" -- turned to schlock.Schlock can be fun just not here. ""23"" is like spending more than 90 minutes watching somebody else complete a Sudoku puzzle. I know what youre thinking No Sudoku puzzle should take more than 90 minutesWesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Then I remembered an old Bob and Ray radio skit in which the roving reporter Wally Ballou interviews a man who plans to build his own tunnel beneath the Hudson River. The man explains that he is doing this because hes tired of paying tolls to go in and out of Manhattan. But isnt building a tunnel like that hard? Wally asks. ""Not really"" his subject replies. ""What you do is get a shovel dig down for a while and then dig straight out."" The movies hero played by Billy Bob Thornton is the space-cadet soul mate of that amateur sandhog. The difference between the movie and the radio skit is that the movie takes its subject seriously. Really seriously and ever so earnestly -- its all about uplift. Charles Farmer isnt supposed to be a space cadet. In the hoary tradition of Frank Capra -- never has a Capra knockoff mustered more cliches -- Farmer is supposed to be a little guy with a big dream and a bigger heart a guy who puts himself and his loving family through some difficult times but still a fearless guy with a can-do spirit who becomes a national hero because he wont let anyone stand in the way of his dream not even if it means taking on those heartless bigwigs in Washington. ENLARGE Its clear from the very first shot -- an astronaut on horseback beneath a vast Western sky -- that the movie will be for better or worse something special. Maybe the rider is crazy a cowboy with a Buzz Lightyear fixation who goes around half-suffocating himself in a space suit and helmet. But a shiny silver rocket stands on its tailfins in his barn. Then maybe hes a crackpot tinkerer who actually believes that his home-made spaceship can break the surly bonds of Earth. Or maybe its a parody of the cockeyed optimism dispensed by the rocket-boy drama ""October Sky"" or of the hapless Wernher von Braun biopic ""I Aim at the Stars"" (for which Mort Sahl suggested the alternate title ""I Aim at the Stars but Often Hit London""). But no this is Billy Bob Thornton a specialist at playing no-nonsense guys who are eccentric but perfectly sane. And the filmmakers -- the director Michael Polish and his writing partner (and twin brother) Mark Polish -- want us to understand that Charles Farmer has the right stuff. An aerospace engineer and former Air Force pilot Farmer was on his way to becoming an astronaut until tragedy struck in the sort of overworked back story thats supposed to confer plausibility. Whats more one of Farmers astronaut buddies played by an uncredited Bruce Willis comes to check out the project takes one look at the rocket and says evidently on the strength of its sheen ""You built this thing? That is some serious engineering"" This movie is some muddled imagineering. Its a glib fantasy that soars beyond the misinformation belt into the vacuous realm of misinspiration. No one asks pointed questions about anything but money of which Farmer seems to have woefully little. His clueless wife Audie played by Virginia Madsen and his bright-faced kids have bought so fully into his insanity (which is meant to be seen as wisdom) that his 15-year-old son takes on the job of flight controller. When things go wrong (before they go inspirationally right) Audie starts to lose faith but she finally sees the light and declares in one of the dumbhead classic lines of all time ""Without the rocket were just a dysfunctional family"" And with the rocket they are what? Just props for a preposterous premise. (Useful props an appealing intimacy suffuses several scenes with the family at the kitchen table.) The oddest thing about this very odd movie is that it doesnt seem to know what to make of itself. Here it is positing faith perseverance and family values as the basic ingredients of Farmers climactic blast-off. Yet bogus uplift gives way to genuine downdraft in a coda that finds the hero chatting casually with Jay Leno. Suddenly the astronaut Farmer is just sly old Billy Bob doing yet another guest shot on yet another broadcast of the Tonight Show. Thats a new definition of weightlessness. Amazing Grace ""Amazing Grace"" is a case of good works done well. This admirable historical drama directed by Michael Apted from a script by Steven Knight tells the personal and also rousingly political story of how the pioneering abolitionist William Wilberforce struggled to end the slave trade in the British Commonwealth in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. (The slaves provided cheap labor for Jamaicas sugar plantations.) Wilberforce as played by the excellent Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd has his own struggle; he is torn between his passion for politics and his love of God. To resolve the conflict he does Gods work in a House of Commons that views the enslavement of black Africans as an economic necessity and that resists his best efforts for decades. The film takes its title from the hymn that was written by Wilberforces friend and mentor John Newton a slave trader turned monk to atone for his sins. Newton is played by Albert Finney who is far from the only formidable actor in a cast that includes Michael Gambon Ciaran Hinds Rufus Sewell Benedict Cumberbatch Toby Jones Bill Paterson and Romola Garai. The Senegalese singer Youssou NDour makes his acting debut as Oloudaqh Equiano an African slave who bought his freedom settled in London and wrote a best seller about his life. The Number 23 ENLARGE Jim Carrey in The Number 23. In ""The Number 23"" Jim Carrey plays a dog catcher Walter Sparrow whos beset by obsessive thinking Everything in his addled brain adds up to 23. (Virginia Madsen is once again the heros clueless wife.) The movie adds up to nothing at all despite Joel Schumachers efforts as director Matthew Libatiques stylish cinematography and layer upon layer of droning complexity. Mesmerized by a mysterious novel with the same title as the film Walter finds frightening parallels between his life and that of the books murderous detective Fingerling a role that Mr. Carrey also plays. Theres little in this first script by Fernley Phillips but bloodless notions -- nothing that might qualify by the light of day as entertainment. Yet the film has its own grim fascination as an example of another kind of obsessive thinking -- the process through which a studio apparatus is brought to bear on developing an idea that defies development. Starter for Ten If James McAvoys dynamic performance as the young doctor in ""The Last King of Scotland"" was overshadowed by Forest Whitakers portrait of Idi Amin as how could it not have been Mr. McAvoy gets his chance to shine as the star of ""Starter for Ten"" a surprisingly agile and delightfully warm romantic comedy set in the 1980s with a not-so-hot-for-export title. (Its a catch-phrase from a real-life British quiz show called ""University Challenge."") Hes Brian Jackson an earnest working-class nerd whose desire ""to know everything"" stands him in good stead as a member of Bristol Universitys academic team on TV. As bright as he is though he cant figure out how to choose between Alice Eves drop-dead gorgeous (and very funny) Alice whose Flashdance sweater hangs so low off one shoulder that it threatens to capsize her and Rebecca Halls funny (and utterly enchanting) Rebecca a campus activist with a gift for self-irony. Rest assured that Brian finally gets it right and that ""Starter for Ten"" gets things right too. Tom Vaughan directed -- in an auspicious feature debut -- from David Nichollss smart lively script.    DVD TIP ""Rory OShea Was Here"" (2005) a flawed but enjoyable comic drama set in contemporary Dublin stars James McAvoy as a severely disabled young Irishman with a spectacularly able mouth. Romola Garai who plays William Wilberforces wife in ""Amazing Grace"" is Siobhan a supermarket clerk -- I described her in my review as ""surely the most beautiful supermarket clerk in the Western world"" -- who becomes Rorys live-in attendant.

Save for later Saved By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 23 2007 Save for later Saved Just in case one dreadful movie this week - ""The Astronaut Farmer"" - isnt enough for you heres another. Thematically ""The Number 23"" actually parallels that other film Both are about an obsessed husband and family man and eerily both costar Virginia Madsen who really should tell her agent she no longer will be accepting any more ""clueless wife"" roles.Tonally however ""The Number 23"" couldnt be further removed from ""The Astronaut Farmer"" which at least was entertainingly awful. By contrast ""The Number 23"" is bleak and brackish. It makes you want to cover your eyes and clutch your ears. Hows that for a quote line?Jim Carrey plays Walter Sparrow a dogcatcher who seems unbalanced from the start although we are supposed to be charting his gradual descent into madness. As a birthday present his wife Agatha (as in Christie?) presents him with a murder mystery ""The Number 23"" that she picked up in a secondhand book store. Walter is immediately taken with the similarities between this mysterious tome which features a ""noirish"" detective named Fingerling and a femme fatale named Fabrizia and events in his own life. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In particular he is overtaken by Fingerlings obsession with the number 23. He sees the number or its permutations everywhere and is terrified that like Fingerling he will commit murder. In nightmarish reenactments Carrey plays Fingerling in the film and Madsen is Fabrizia. Its not exactly a blessing to play two stupid-silly roles. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Why would Carrey allow himself to be in such a movie? Hes been trying to stretch himself for years and at least once in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" he managed to successfully convert his patented comic hysteria into dramatic hysteria.But in ""The Number 23"" he might as well be making scary faces in front of a mirror. Its not his fault exactly. Director Joel Schumacher is in his dried-blood mode here. (Remember ""8MM""?) Theres almost no way for an actor to drill through the grunge.If we are going to watch a movie about a man trying to unlock the secrets of his past it would helpful if we had some idea of his present. Walter is such a tortured riddle that he never remotely elicits sympathy from us. In fact the only entity I felt sorry for in ""The Number 23"" was Ned a big white mutt that Walter has it in for. When he tries to run Ned down in his van I was much more concerned about Neds safety than Walters sanity.The press kit for this movie provides a helpful list of enigmas surrounding the number 23 including the fact that - very scary - ""The Number 23"" opens in theaters Friday.Heres a prediction ""The Number 23"" will score 23 on metacritic.com. Grade F Rated R for violence disturbing images sexuality and language.

"Carreys Number 23 Fuzzy Math -- and Moviemaking washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Carreys Number 23 Fuzzy Math -- and Moviemaking Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 23 2007 I wonder what the crusty old studio boss Sam Goldwyn would have said to Jim Carrey about the script for ""The Number 23."" I think it might have gone . . . something like this ""What are you nuts? Kid whatsa matter with you? What we need is some nice fresh new cliches. This cliche is too old. Guy thinks he may have murdered a chick and may soon murder his wife. But he dont know? Who wrote that a dumb genius? Youre funny kid. You do that thing with your arms all twisty and make your face go goo-goo like pudding and wear that funny hair But instead you want to . . . act ?"" And the world would indeed have been better off then than it is now with ""The Number 23"" in the place of the humble but undoubtedly amusing ""Ace Ventura 7."" The movie seems like nothing so much as a vanity project giving comic genius Carrey a chance to show serious licks as a thespian. And baby does he thesp He chews the scenery the lighting the wires all the doughnuts and most of the electricians trucks Stuntmen beware. Script girls run for your life. Virginia Madsens hairstylists hit the deck Good Lord. He plays a dogcatcher named Walter Sparrow. Its probably not the first but its got to be one of very few heroic dogcatcher movies. The setting is a small California town and the dog he tries to catch is Ned who bites him which makes him late to meet his wife Agatha (Madsen) so she kills time in a secondhand bookstore where she spies a red volume by one ""Topsy Krett"" called ""The Number 23"" which she buys and gives to him. Hoo-hah then the acting really begins. It seems that author Krett is doing riffs on the strange melodies concealed within the bland confines of the number that starts with 2 and ends with 3 and has nothing in between. It turns out that this is a most interesting number to a certain turn of mind with almost limitless mathematical possibilities (see Wikipedia for a brief intro to 23ology). All sorts of patterns and conjurations may be arranged to yield it in some strange place such as my birth date 3-25-46. If you subtract 25 from 46 you get 21 then add the 3 you get er 24 which is one more than 23  Pretty amazing huh? But the book isnt a disquisition its actually a novel about a man who sees 23 everywhere until theres nothing but 23 and as he reads the book the dogcatcher starts seeing the number 23 everywhere. Hmmm 23rd nervous breakdown anyone? Maybe its me but I hate nervous-breakdown movies. Along with other debased pop formats like amnesia movies and hes-chasing-himself movies theyre a lot less interesting to watch than to make. The director Joel Schumacher and the cinematographer Matthew Libatique are Carreys enablers. Schumacher whos old enough to know better gives the movie a jittery quality as if hes having a nervous breakdown too and a symptom seems to be that he puts lights in strange places. Libatique is also having a nervous breakdown and his symptoms include the urge to splatter O-negative red everywhere. This is the reddest movie ever made and it posits a world in which a nice bourgeois housewife like Madsens Agatha decides to paint her living room the color of a fresh murder. Somehow both the book and the movie lead Carreys Sparrow to the murder 13 years earlier of a young woman by her professor. On the 23rd of February Sparrow becomes convinced that the murderer is actually author Topsy Krett but that annoyed fellow -- hes in prison for life for the crime -- denies that he killed the girl. Who killed the girl? Who wrote the book? Why does Walter now get all goober-skinned when his hands caress the handles of the various butcher knives that Schumacher has carelessly left all over the set? And will Libatique find a hue of red between magenta crushed peach dawn and heart-transplant deoxygenated purple to fling before the cameras hungry eye? Oy. As Sam Goldwyn said Include me out. The Number 23 (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for graphic images of murder victims violence psychological intensity and profanity.

I think of an actor who is frictionless and elastic who has the slightly detached quicksilver quality of a talk-show host trying to work up a moment of ""sincerity."" In his straight roles (it feels wrong with Carrey to use a word like serious) his eagerness to please becomes the most prominent thing about him and he can seem ineffectual with those pleading eyes and that gawking jaw -- a nerd parading himself for no good reason with the lightness of a clown. For a while as I watched him in The Number 23 Joel Schumachers glossy ""dark"" thriller about murder numerology and you know whats ""real"" I experienced the awkwardness I have so often felt at movies like The Majestic or the remake of Fun With Dick and Jane when a Jim Carrey ordinary-guy performance isnt working. Tall and goosey with a shock of hair that falls over his eyes (he now looks like a 45-year-old choirboy) Carrey plays Walter Sparrow a sweet mopey dogcatcher married and with a teenage son. As a birthday gift from his wife (Virginia Madsen) Walter receives a handmade novel that looks as if its been typed and pasted together by your basic everyday paranoid schizophrenic conspiracy theorist. Its called The Number 23 it was written by someone named Topsy Kretts and its full of coincidence? you decide hugger-mugger about the number 23. The movies official press kit offers such spooky examples of the ""23 enigma"" as ""Kurt Cobain died in 1994 1+9+9+4 = 23."" A little too much of this sort of thing and you really could go crazy. Let us put aside for a moment the books sinister mysteries. Simply accepting Jim Carrey as an average husband and parent requires a backflip of suspended disbelief. Yet its one that a lot of audiences may find they want to take if only because Carrey doing his first creepy-junky puzzle horror thriller throws himself into blood-bucket acting with a commitment thats scary enough to hold you. (It isnt hard to see why The man needs a hit.) As Walter reads the book we see him imagine himself as the main character a sexy disheveled detective by the name of Fingerling. Think Carrey imitating Rick Springfield acting like Bogart in a moody cologne commercial. As we watch Fingerling with his stubbled scowl his snaky tattoos and -- yes -- a saxophone plunges into a compulsive back-clawing love affair with a dangerous siren (also played by Madsen). He also becomes fixated on the number 23 an obsession that spreads like a virus to Walter who begins to see the number everywhere adding together the digits of this birthday or that address only to end up over and over again with 23 (or 32 -- which as he breathlessly proclaims is ""23 in reverse""). Are you terrified yet? As Walter jabbers on about hidden numerological signs were only too aware that those numbers are as arbitrary in their patterns as the script needs them to be. There are moments when I groaned and giggled at The Number 23. Yet after a while a compelling thing starts to happen. As Walter searches for the key to the books code (is it a warning? a confession? both?) the stylized overeager quality of Carreys acting -- the very fragility of his impersonation of an average fellow -- begins to work for the movie. When he points a knife at his wife quivering like a madman because just maybe hes channeling the spirit of a killer Carrey plays the moment with a conviction more startling and genuine than his typical aw-shucks sweetness. Walters personality as it turns out truly is a conceit a happy-face mask strapped over a soul of anxiety. He moves into a flophouse with rotten green light and stains on the walls and hes drawn into the books images -- of a suicide a students affair with her professor a bedroom murder -- which become interlaced with his own nightmares. Is Walter being driven to commit a murder too? Schumacher parades these visions with a flash-cut trippiness that one remembers from movies like Jacobs Ladder or The Butterfly Effect -- thrillers gloppy with omens overly drenched in ""mood."" But the films assaultive shock editing holds you and so does its mystery which is like The Da Vinci Code with insanity and violence in place of highbrow signifiers. By the end youll want to stick around if only to crack the Jim Carrey code Is he a real actor after all or is the rabid urgency with which he keeps trying to be the most real thing about him?

"Number 23 The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; number-23-the ) Number 23 The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Since this is a thriller there must be a twist. One goes into a movie like The Number 23 with this expectation. However not only is the twist telegraphed early but it is presented in a clumsy and unconvincing manner. Other films have employed a similar plot device to good effect. (I will refrain from naming titles since that would constitute unnecessary spoilerage.) The Number 23 shows how not to do it. The film has a few things going for it. Matthew Libatiques cinematography is evocative and there are isolated individual scenes that work when dissociated from the movie as a whole. But as a cohesive piece of entertainment The Number 23 is largely a failure. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) is leading a seemingly normal life with a seemingly normal wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) and a seemingly normal son Robin (Logan Lerman). (Its necessary to throw in a ""seemingly"" here and there because of the nature of the production.) Everything changes the day his wife purchases a copy of a book entitled The Number 23 at a used bookstore. The book is about the obsession of the main character a detective named Fingerling with the number 23 in its various permutations. Walter becomes obsessed with the book. He senses an eerie connection between himself and Fingerling and like the protagonist he believes theres something important about how often 23 appears in his life. A psychologist friend (Danny Huston) suggests that he sees 23 everywhere because hes looking for 23 everywhere but Walter ignores this sensible advice and begins to imagine conspiracies and murders. The most interesting thing about The Number 23 is the number 23 and how it can be construed to arise in seemingly any circumstance. (This often requires a lot of fudging.) This is a real pop culture phenomenon sometimes referred to as ""The 23 Enigma"" or ""The 23 Curse."" (Every person has 46 chromosomes 23 from each parent. The tilt of the Earths axis is 23 degrees. 9/11/2001 9+11+2+1=23. The date Titanic sank - 4/15/1912 4+1+5+1+9+1+2=23. And so ona|) Unfortunately despite several lengthy discussions about numerology in the movie this is largely a red herring. It does not figure prominently in the solution of the mystery and thats one of several reasons why the film is disappointing and anti-climactic. Another big problem is that the ""reveal"" occurs about 20 minutes before the ending. This requires us to endure a quarter hour of tedious exposition as the filmmakers hold our hands and take us painstakingly through every incident to show how everything fits together. Its not all that complicated to begin with and its annoying when a movie adopts such a patronizing attitude toward an audience. Most thrillers demand a certain degree of attentiveness from viewers. The Number 23 allows bathroom visits and nap taking because it summarizes everything in the final 15 minutes. Whether or not the explanation is convincing is another matter altogether. Its hard to argue that Jim Carrey is completely miscast as Walter but he is perhaps not the best choice for someone with such extreme mood swings. Carrey in ""serious actor"" mode is fine playing a normal guy (which is Walter for about a third of the running length) but he lacks the intensity and desperation that are eventually required as obsession grips the character and pulls him under. On the other hand when depicting the adventures of Fingerling in several neo-noir sequences hes a solid match. Virginia Madsen suffers from the same issue that has plagued her since Sideways (and perhaps before that) underuse. Aside from her few brief appearances as the character of Fabrizia opposite Fingerling she isnt given much to do that falls outside the spectrum of standing by her man. Danny Huston shows up a few times in the requisite psychologist part but hes not integral to the story. Ultimately the limitations of the actors are not what sinks The Number 23; its the writing and direction. Joel Schumacher has what could best be called a checkered history and this is not one of his better films. The movies premise while not brilliant is solid and could have been used to develop an edge-of-the-seat thriller with a genuine surprise or two. As it exists however The Number 23 feels perfunctory and is developed in such a way that few people are likely to leave the theater satisfied. The movie isnt sufficiently lurid or campy to be enjoyable on an exploitative level and its not well enough crafted to work as a more serious form of entertainment. The Number 23 is a lot closer to a zero than to its title denomination.

Gimmicky numerology plus Jim Carrey minus narrative coherence equals ""The Number 23"" a visually and psychologically murky thriller that given its heros paranoid obsession with the titular number plays like a very grungy episode of ""Sesame Street."" Noirish fantasy sequences and red herrings galore fail to enliven this straight-faced but silly exercise from helmer Joel Schumacher while the prospect of Carrey in downbeat thriller mode promises to intrigue as many potential audiences as it turns off equating to likely midrange numbers at the box office. Fernley Phillips first produced screenplay is structured around the ""23 enigma"" which states that all significant events names dates and times are somehow connected to the number 23. Witness the historical evidence Julius Caesar was stabbed 23 times; Shakespeare was born on April 23 1564 and died on April 23 1616; and the Titanic sank on April 15 1912 and obviously 4+1+5+1+9+1+2=23. (Of course by the same logic Shakespeares date of birth adds up to 25 but never mind.) The phenomenon begins to haunt middle-aged dog catcher Walter Sparrow (Carrey) soon after his wife (Virginia Madsen) tellingly named Agatha gives him a mystery novel bearing the same title as the film. As he reads the book creepily narrated by a detective named Fingerling (also played by Carrey) Walter realizes he and the protagonist have an unsettling number of things in common. And like Fingerling Walter concludes that everything in his life -- from his birthday to his social security number -- is overshadowed by the dreaded 23. The book-within-a-movie unfolds in a series of stylized neo-noir tableaus soaked in Carreys vaguely Philip Marlowe-esque voiceover as Fingerling murders his black-wigged moll Fabrizia (also Madsen) in a jealous rage and frames her lover (Danny Huston unctuous as ever) for the crime. Life all too quickly imitates art and Walterstarts having dark visions of stabbing his wife while their close friend Isaac (Huston again) hovers semi-lecherously in the background. Script compounds its mysteries by adding a dead woman an ominous dog and enough wacko higher-level math to make auds feel like theyre trapped in a numerology seminar. Eventually Walter gets a grip and with Agatha and their son Robin (Logan Lerman) sets out to discover who the books author is and why hes playing all these sinister mind games. As the revelation nears Phillips self-consciously twisty screenplay repeatedly favors cleverness at the expense of clarity and it remains too enamored of its central gimmick to mutate persuasively into either a probing psychological study or later a moving family drama. Worse still Schumacher (returning to contempo thrillers after ""The Phantom of the Opera"") never finds the requisite visual strategy to convincingly render the films parallel worlds. The scenes from the novel contain some striking images including one room thats flooded in futuristic white as well as generally more off-kilter compositions but the films dreamlike dissolves repeatedly undercut any kind of suspenseful rhythm. As he proved most recently in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (which plumbed the depths of his subconscious much more inventively) Carrey has gifts far beyond the range of dumb comedy; here however hes simply miscast in a role that would have benefited from a lesser-known character thesp. Wearing his hair uncharacteristically long the actor seems wrong for the role of a husband and father from the start although later twists do shed some light on why this might be the case. Still neither Walter nor Fingerling makes a very compelling central figure and Carreys need to imbue the former with a darkly humorous streak is distractingly palpable. Madsen is OK as Walters wife and rather less so as the trampy Fabrizia suggesting as did ""Firewall"" that the gifted actress may want to avoid supporting-spouse roles in her post-""Sideways"" career. Pics overall look is deliberately drab and cheerless relying heavily on grubby greens and browns although the color red recurs throughout as a bold if obvious motif.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Jim Carreys Unlucky Number His new bid for seriousness doesnt add up. Among the problems Joel Schumacher. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis Illustration by Sean McCabe  (Photo Christine Loss/Courtesy of New Line Cinema) The Number 23 revolves around an ordinary man who finds a book called The Number 23 and begins to see that number everywhere (1112 on the bedside clock11+12 = 23)which triggers fevered hallucinations of himself as a gumshoe chasing a suicide blonde in settings reminiscent of a fifties pulp novel as well as nasty encounters with a half-dark half-light mutt called Ned with a predilection for cemeteries. Its not the stupidest premise of all time. In Darren Aronofskys brilliant Pi a mans obsession with a mathematical constant spirals into an existential maelstrom. Jonathan Carroll churns out fast enjoyable novels in which portentous signs (among them pooches) foreshadow the trapdoor about to open under their protagonists so-called reality. No The Number 23 didnt have to be as narcotizingly bad as it is. The stars had to be in perfect alignment. The biggest star of course is Jim Carrey who obviously relished the chance to fall apart on camera. The problem is that hes never together on camera. As a hyperstylized clown he has the instincts (and the discipline) to modulate those ever-ready tics and spasms and rubber-jawed gyrations. Shackled by realismand by the seriousness of this enterprisehe can only act more catatonic His brain seems to be grinding emptiness. As his wife the demure Virginia Madsen is attentive to the point of self-effacement. Scene after scene consists of her (along with the other actors) watching the star in his impotent frenzy. BACKSTORY The 23 enigma is a numerological theory that says (were simplifying here but only slightly) that every event relates somehow to the number 23. But does this theory carry any weight on the other side of the multiplexs walls? Well the movie is Joel Schumachers 23rd and the combined letters in his and Jim Carreys names do add up to 23. Carrey also feels a deep connection with the enigma. He told People magazine Ive [been fixated on] the number 23 for years. Its everywhere. Each parent passes on 23 chromosomes; Earths axis is at a 23-degree angle. Psalm 23 is my mantra. Given a script by Fernley Phillips that feels like a film-school exerciseall structure no stuffingJoel Schumacher works his familiar anti-magic. Incapable like his leading man of establishing a baseline of realism he delivers one overdesigned overcostumed overlit image after another. Shot by computer-enhanced shot The Number 23 is impressive but those shots dont come from anywhere or build on one another. All the connective tissue is missing; theres no there there. Are there supernatural forces at work behind the recurring 23s? Or are we watching the return of the represseda guilty conscience eating through the protagonists facade of normalcy? I wont give away the ending which manages to be both preposterous and mundane. The movie is successful in one respect It proves that 23 is some bad-ass number indeed. The story of William Wilberforces exhausting twenty-year struggle to persuade the House of Commons to outlaw slavery in Great Britain Michael Apteds Amazing Grace is a beautifully chiseled blunt instrument. No its not subtle but how subtle was slavery? The movie opens with an ailing Wilberforce hopping out of his carriage to stop a man from beating a fallen horse (in close-up) and thats about as morally complex as it gets. Given that we dont need to be convinced that chaining men women and children in the holds of cargo ships (killing more than half) is a very bad thing the drama comes from how the hero confrontsand confoundsthe overweening self-interest of his opponents. It is instructive even today. Because Britains ruling class has no firsthand acquaintance with the stink of Africans dying in their own waste Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) lures a group of lords and ladies aboard a party boat where they are plied with food and wine until their vessel pulls up beside a reeking slave ship The noblewomen weep while the noblemen quail. When he is shouted down by his fellow legislators Wilberforce and a band of fellow abolitionists take their case to the peoplepublishing books and pamphlets manufacturing cameos organizing sugar boycotts and generating petitions with hundreds of thousands of signatures. Still unable to sway the majority they resort to a piece of legislative trickery I hope will inspire todays boringly fair-minded progressives. Amazing Grace isnt all politics It opens at the fifteen-year mark in Wilberforces crusade when hes broken in mind and body. Fortunately the wealthy bachelor is set up with the fetching fellow progressive Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) who fastens her big blue eyes on his well-sculpted face while he tells her the story of his movement and manages not to stare at her cleavage. After 90 minutes of flashbacks she gives him a second windinspiring him to round up the old abolition gang and give it one last push. I dont know if the epigrams that tumble from Wilberforces mouth are the work of the screenwriter Steven Knight or taken directly from the parliamentary record but their bite is surprising. You should hear him before he takes up the Africans cause risk being branded an appeaser by imploring this congress to bring the troops home before thousands more die in a losing war abroad. (Hes talking about America of course. I mean during the Revolution.) A lot of very fine actors have jumped on Apteds anti-slave ship to help him mark the bicentennial of the abolition of Britains slave trade. Gruffudd is every inch the five-foot-four Wilberforce plus another eight or so to allow him to loom over the diminutive Toby Jones who plays the sneering Duke of Clarence. Michael Gambon shows off his peerless timing as a lordly convert to Wilberforces cause and a young actor with the formidable name of Benedict Cumberbatch makes Wilberforces pal William Pitt (the Younger) a character of equal stature. Its fun to see Rufus Sewell usually a villain on the side of the angels and to watch Albert Finney use his groggy demeanor and phlegmatic voice to suggest the torment of John Newton the slave-ship captain turned pastor who wrote the hymn Amazing Grace to atone for the horrors over which hed presided. 1 2 Next Share this story...

As he reads on its like looking inside his head as the lonely boy protagonist becomes a moody detective Walters own unfulfilled ambition. Soon however his fictional alter-egos mind-addling obsession with the number 23 leads to kinky sex suicide and murder. How so? Well what with birth dates both personal and famous (Shakespeare Kurt Cobain) totalling the magic numeral not to mention other coincidences the maddening ubiquity of the number pitches the gumshoe right over the edge setting up the possibility that the same fate lies in store for Walter. The conceit has a buzz-factor - though the film eschews the most obviously spooky 9+11+2+0+0+1=23 - and an intriguing first half-hour draws us into the so-called 23 Enigma. But turning this into a workable plot is beyond writer Fernley Phillips as spiralling events tumble into inconsequentiality and gestures towards moral seriousness prove ill-founded. Schumacher keeps it pacy the murky cameraworks very cool Carrey suitably wide-eyed but its limitations are finally only too obvious.
