"A Spoonful of Cyanide The Chilly Borderline Nastiness of Saving Mr. Banks << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com A Spoonful of Cyanide The Chilly Borderline Nastiness of Saving Mr. Banks Courtesy of Disney Disney December 30 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print In Saving Mr. Banks Emma Thompson plays Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers. Its the early 1960s and Travers keeps her hair in a short close perm. She wears body-hugging tweed suits and her face is frozen in a clench of exasperation. Everything about her is tight which is meant to make her eventual emotional undoing seem psychological. Because Walt Disney really loves her book Travers has been flown from London to Los Angeles to help turn it into a movie. Hes been trying for 20 years and for 20 years the answer has been ""no."" But now shes broke and blocked and doesnt want to lose her house. So she deigns to visit a city she finds hideous negotiate with a man she finds smarmy and work on a film shes sure to detest. Traverss mornings and afternoons are spent first condescending to her driver (Paul Giamatti) and then in a bungalow on the Disney lot with Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) a veteran screenwriter and Robert and Richard M. Sherman (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman respectively) the legendary Disney songwriters. She might as well be at Alcatraz. But in her mind these men work for her not Disney. Travers wants the sessions recorded. She makes a withering comparison between Laurence Olivier and Dick Van Dyke and bemoans the songs that the Saving Mr. Banks audience already knows are classics. People are going to be tempted to say ""I didnt know Cruella de Vil wrote childrens books."" You know where this is headed -- not because theres a finished film to prove it but because Disney is played by Tom Hanks. The debonair geniality Hanks gives the role is so specific (hes graying tanned and moustached; he keeps his smoking a secret but you detect a polite cigarette musk about him) and the more he asks Travers to consider the happiness a Mary Poppins musical will bring to all the children of the world the Grinchier that Travers is meant to seem. Meanwhile the movie makes overbearing use of flashbacks to Traverss Australian childhood with Colin Farrell as her beloved drunken Irish father. Those are all a setup for a dramatic collision with the present that you can see coming after about five minutes. Very little of the history here appears to be true. Disney was more of a businessman about the adaptation and Travers wasnt the sourpuss shes supposed to be here. In fact an audiotape from one of the early sessions plays during the closing credits. Its of a scene reenacted in the film and Travers sounds kinder and more reasonable than Thompsons version. So what on earth is the point? And why would an actor want to play a role in what is effectively a sort of character assassination? The movie is written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith and directed by John Lee Hancock who made The Blind Side. Its almost lawyerly in its manipulation. What theyve done with Travers is subjugated her to a bunch of men. She rejects informality of all kinds and demands to be called ""Mrs. Travers"" even though she never married. There are parts here for Kathy Baker and Melanie Paxson whos terrific. Baker is credited as playing an executive but she seems like one of Disneys secretaries; Paxsons character actually is one. And Travers doesnt really talk to either of them. The movie winds up using all of Traverss childhood misfortunes (then those of her drivers daughter) against her. Its as though Traverss biography is the only reason she might object to a musical. Really isnt she to be admired for weighing the costs of working with Hollywood? In reality the finished version of Mary Poppins left her bitter (she disliked the animation sequences). In this telling the movie leaves her bawling. The whole thing leaves you with an appalling chill. It feels like a warning from Hollywood to the ambivalent creators of anything Take the spoonful of sugar or well force-feed it to you.

""When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?"" an exasperated Walt (played by Tom Hanks) demands of author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) after she rejects his invitation to join him at the Happiest Place on Earth.The makers of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" might be posing a similar question to moviegoers. When does anybody today get to see Walt Disney come to life in a Disney movie about the making of a Disney movie no less? We do here and its hard not to be charmed.""Saving Mr. Banks"" tells the story of how Disney who has promised his daughters to turn their favorite book ""Mary Poppins"" into a movie courts Travers its very reluctant author. ""Reluctant"" hardly sums up Travers attitude. For years she has rejected all offers to put ""Mary Poppins"" the book that defined her career on the screen.Travers agrees to travel to Los Angeles where a deal with Disney awaits her signature only because shes nearly broke. But that doesnt mean shell give in to music. Or animated penguins. Or made-up words. Or any other bright ideas from writer Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak).When Hanks and Thompson are on screen together ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a happy place indeed. Every scene in the writers room where the Shermans sketch out their songs and DaGradi lays out the script for Travers is a complete delight. The scene in which the brothers unfurl ""Lets Go Fly a Kite"" will make the audience want to leap up and dance along. Paul Giamatti is adorable as Travers LA driver.If this were the movie ""Saving Mr. Banks"" would be the feel-good delight of the holiday season. Instead director John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") and screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith tell two stories one the London-and-Hollywood tale of the making of ""Mary Poppins"" and the other the Australian-flashback tale of the making of P.L. Travers.The flashbacks serve to explain how Travers became the cranky absurdly difficult woman were coming to know growing up as Helen Lyndon Goff (played by Annie Rose) far from anywhere with a charming dissolute father (Colin Farrell) and a broken-spirited mother (Ruth Wilson). But they also drag the movie down into a sad swamp and the punchline that finally explains ""Mary Poppins"" is long in arriving.Every time we get engaged in one story the scene flips to the other and although the flashbacks are well-acted and frequently insightful there are too many of them and they occur too often. They also make ""Saving Mr. Banks"" -- youll understand the title better when you see the movie -- at least half an hour too long. After some of the grimmer flashbacks its with relief that we return to 1961 Hollywood where Mrs. Travers (""It is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger use my first name"" she protests when anyone calls her ""Pamela"") insists repeatedly that ""Mary Poppins"" (""never just Mary"") is not for sale. The charming but notoriously tough Disney has met his match with her.Stay to the end for scenes of the real players and audio of a meeting featuring Travers herself to be convinced that nobody is exaggerating how difficult she was. Pencil Thompson in now for an Oscar nomination and maybe a win and prepare to leave the theater humming the iconic songs.What ""Saving Mr. Banks""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 206  Content Adult situations in flashbacks Gail Pennington is the TV critic for the Post-Dispatch.

Travers gets prettified in this telling.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 19 2013 -- 359pm Disney Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) shows Disneyland to ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) in Disneys ""Saving Mr. Banks."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a shameless wad of corporate PR a feel-good self-serving Disney film about the making of a Disney film. The property in question is ""Mary Poppins"" and the new film dramatizes the culmination of a 23-year crusade by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) to win the film rights from the author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson). It was a power struggle between two people accustomed to getting their own way. The film slaps a prefab happy ending on the bruising collision of ego art and commerce. The story gives us Travers as a grown-up and child. In the 1961 scenes shes a prickly prissy old girl exasperated by Disneys relentless campaign to acquire her beloved childrens book character but in financial straits because of declining sales. Travers agrees to visit California the land of shallow sunshine and money-stuffed briefcases for two weeks of creative consultations on the proposed script. She half hopes the negotiations will collapse less than half believes that her invincible integrity will mold the project into a film she can live with. A second story line takes us repeatedly to 1906 Australia. Here Travers (under her birth name Helen Goff) gambols through a childhood of genteel poverty. Her whimsical father (Colin Farrell) a playful tippling bank officer is a link to their ancestral Ireland the land of myths stories and alcoholism. Mother (Ruth Wilson) observes her spouse with a mightily furrowed brow. SAVING MR. BANKS  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic elements including some unsettling images. The script by Sue Smith and Kelly Marcel offers ever-so-tidy connections between the modern-day fussbudget and the traumas of little Helens youth. Mrs. Travers demand that the ""Mary Poppins"" film not contain the color red surely links to the ketchup-scarlet stains on poor tubercular Papas handkerchief. In the Mary Poppins books a cool collected woman arrives seemingly out of nowhere and proceeds to impose on a chaotic household her ideas of order. Thats what Thompson attempts to achieve here laboring to bend Hanks creative funhouse to her will. Her performance is deliciously prickly and prissy. She knits her forehead into a perfect migraine of exasperation at her cheery chattering studio limo driver (Paul Giamatti). With screenwriter Don DiGradi (Bradley Whitford) and songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman) she wrangles over animation (she loathed it) the casting of Dick Van Dyke (""not one of the greats"") and lyrics that bend the rules of English grammar (they hide the title sheet of ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious""). Hanks Disney is a calm deliberate ""Father Knows Best"" type whose only vices are an afternoon whiskey and hints of off-screen smoking. With gauche chumminess he calls the starchy Mrs. Travers ""Pam"" and he hands out business cards pre-signed with his autograph when they tour Disneyland together. You can see why he and the glacially reserved Travers would disagree. The film rewrites history creating a London get-together in which Disney woos the old maid with a smarmy Dr. Phil-worthy amateur therapy session. He directly addresses her childhood grief and tells a cornball tale of his own youthful woe in Missouri where he delivered papers in blizzard conditions. The real Travers would have shut him down with a brisk ""we all have our troubles."" The film omits Disneys double-cross of Travers granting her script supervision but no say in the final cut a loophole that enabled him to jam in a troupe of animated tea-serving penguins. Disneys grasp of what moviegoers would enjoy was shrewd of course. ""Mary Poppins"" became one of the studios biggest hits and won five Oscars including best actress for Julie Andrews. It made Travers rich but not happy. Years later she wrote ""It was as if they took a sausage threw away the contents but kept the skin and filled the skin with their own ideas very far from the original substance."" Thats what ""Saving Mr. Banks"" does with the ""Mary Poppins"" back story. Travers reportedly cried tears of betrayal following the premiere and in her will explicitly forbade Disney from having any more access to her characters. But here shes delighted. This account isnt the heartwarming Disney version its the saccharine Mickey Mouse version. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Saving Mr. Banks | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; saving-mr-banks ) Saving Mr. Banks (United States/United Kingdom 2013) December 19 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli For an author of long-form fiction the writing process isnt merely technical. As absurd as it might seem the writer bonds with his or her characters to the point where they can become as ""real"" as any flesh-and-blood person. This is especially true when a character incorporates key aspects of someone from the authors past. Such was the case with P.L. Travers the writer of the popular Mary Poppins books which are arguably best known to children (and adults) around the world as a result of the 1964 movie adaptation. Saving Mr. Banks is an account of how that movie came into being despite a Travers 20-year resistance to the overtures of Walt Disney. Travers loved her characters so much that the thought of them being changed or degraded for the big screen was anathema. As an exploration of the ""making of"" process associated with Mary Poppins Saving Mr. Banks offers engaging material but the film gains emotional heft through a series of flashbacks that unveil why the characters in Mary Poppins possessed great meaning for Travers. Moving back and forth between 1906 Australia and 1961 Los Angeles the film provides a full portrait of the author who is played as a child by Annie Rose Buckley and as a sixty-something woman by Emma Thompson. The movies other standout performance is Tom Hanks whose interpretation of Walt Disney is said by those who knew the late Hollywood heavyweight to be spot-on even down to his little mannerisms. Disney is opening Saving Mr. Banks to mark the occasion of Mary Poppins 50th anniversary. As good a piece of drama as this is it also represents canny marketing since the film it references is being released in a restored Blu-ray version with a buffet of special features. Saving Mr. Banks serves as the appetizer; its almost impossible to watch this movie and not feel the urge to seek out a copy of the Julie Andrews/Dick Van Dyke musical. It has also been suggested that Saving Mr. Banks is the Walt Disney Corporations posthumous apology to Travers since her bitterness toward Disney deepened after the release of Mary Poppins (something not shown in the film). Saving Mr. Banks offers two separate stories that are interleaved to emphasize connections not initially evident. The first follows the exploits of eight-year old Ginty as she and her family settle in a ramshackle home and try to forge a life in territory that could best be described as ""isolated."" Her father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) views this as a great adventure and his passion fires Gintys excitement. Her mother Margaret (Ruth Wilson) is unenthused. As loving as Goff can be however he also adores the bottle too much and his alcoholism represents his downfall. The bulk of the narrative transpires in the early 1960s. Disney has flown Travers to Los Angeles in a last-ditch attempt to convince her to sell him the rights to Mary Poppins. He allows her to meet the would-be screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and the Brothers Sherman Robert (B.J. Novak) and Richard (Jason Schwartzman) who have been hired to write the songs. He gives her a chatty driver (Paul Giamatti) who talks up the beauty of Los Angeles and provides her with a personal tour of Disneyland. He allows her to critique the script and expresses to her what Mary Poppins means to him. History tells us that Travers relented but Saving Mr. Banks shows how difficult the process was. Those familiar with the behind-the-scenes negotiations that transpired more than a half-century ago laud the movies truthfulness. Richard Sherman the surviving member of the songwriting duo acted as a consultant. (Saving Mr. Banks is dedicated to Robert who died in early 2013.) Screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith and director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) should be commended for keeping the tone light while still achieving a significant emotional impact. The movie avoids commonplace traps; it never becomes maudlin and it doesnt transform Travers into a likeable elderly lady whose heart of gold is camouflaged by crotchetiness. Solid acting is one reason why Saving Mr. Banks works as effectively as it does. The cast is top-heavy with past Oscar nominees and winners. Hanks and Thompsons credentials are obvious but supporting players Paul Giamatti and Rachel Griffiths also have nominations on their records. As good as Hanks and Thompson are (and theyre both excellent) the strength of the secondary performers is a quality that elevates Saving Mr. Banks above the level of a by-the-numbers ""based on a true story"" tale. Thomas Newmans score is notable for liberally sampling familiar Disney themes especially those from Mary Poppins. No fewer than ten of the Sherman Brothers tunes are used in one form or another and a highlight occurs when Travers hears ""Lets Go Fly a Kite"" for the first time - the song that ""saves"" Mr. Banks. The musical connection and the use of clips near the end form an umbilical cord between Saving Mr. Banks and Mary Poppins and allow nostalgia to boost the films effectiveness.

Travers in Disneys ""Saving Mr. Banks""openign in the Dallas area on Dec. 20. By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 19 December 2013 1244 AM Updated 19 December 2013 1244 AM Related Stellar cast delivers a wildly energetic caper comedy in American Hustle (A-) Acting and music mesmerize in Inside Llewyn Davis the story of a 1960s folk artist (A) Even if Disney werent distributing Saving Mr. Banks it would be easy to mistake the movie for a particularly well-executed Disney commercial. Question How did Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) convince Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to turn her beloved book over to the House of Mouse in 1961? Answer According to this account by being Walt Disney of course.But beneath Banks crass self-aggrandizement lies a pretty charming portrait of two overly proud people butting creative heads. Yes charming. Thats what Disney does and it does it well enough to turn even this condescending pap into something palatable.Thompson is wonderfully precise as Travers the celebrated British author lured to sunny Los Angeles by the prospect of seeing her umbrella-toting nanny adapted for the movies. A steady stream of flashbacks explains her reluctance -- sort of. Her dad (an er charming Colin Farrell) was a bit of a dreamer and seemingly the happiest alcoholic in a sun-dappled Australia. As Pa neared his end Travers emotionally distant Ma (Ruth Wilson) enlisted a nanny to assist the changing of the guard. Paging Dr. Freud.If hes busy call Donald Duck. When Papa Walt wants to close the deal he takes Mrs. Travers as she insists on being called to Disneyland. It is after all the happiest place on Earth.When Saving Mr. Banks works its because of Thompson and Hanks and because of some lively artistic process scenes between Travers and the flustered Disney creative team (Bradley Whitford Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak all of them game). ""What is all this jollification?"" asks Travers and Thompson gives the words a daggerlike enunciation.If only Saving Mr. Banks werent so insistent that all we need is a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down. The denouement between Disney and Travers is cringe-worthy; it seems the great Walt was a keen psychoanalyst as well as a master showman. Forget your past troubles. Ride the Teacups. Itll all be OK.

"Saving Mr. Banks (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Saving Mr. Banks (PG-13) Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson star as Walt Disney and P.L. Travers in this drama about the making of ""Mary Poppins."" Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/19/2013 Editor rating 2 Saving Mr. Banks is two movies crammed into one cumbersome overlong drama. The good half is set in Burbank in 1961 when Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) after 20 years of requests finally gets author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to travel from London and visit the studio to consider signing over the film rights to her beloved Mary Poppins book series. Travers is fiercely protective of the novels and has great disdain for the Disney brand of entertainment (""These books dont lend themselves to chirping and prancing"" she huffs at him). But Travers is also broke and suffering from writers block so she agrees to consider Disneys proposal under certain conditions She will be involved in the writing of the screenplay she will have final say over every detail of the film -- and most important of all the movie will have no animated characters whatsoever. Thompson plays Travers as a stuffy unhappy woman who is irritated by everything and everyone (""It smells like chlorine and sweat"" she says of Los Angeles when she steps out of the airport). Her crusty demeanor along with the inspiration for her Mary Poppins books are revealed via constant flashbacks to her past when as a child (Annie Rose Buckley) she moved to the Australian outback and watched her banker father (Colin Farrell) slowly drink himself to death. Director John Lee Hancock (The Alamo The Blind Side) shoots Travers childhood in golden sleep-inducing hues and drenched with bathos that is at odds with the inherent darkness of what Travers suffered. There are also way too many of them constantly interrupting the fun of watching Travers collaborate with the screenwriter (Bradley Whitford) and composers (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman) trying their best to please this unpleasable woman. Hanks plays Disney like a saintly father figure -- he tells Travers he has chased after her for so long because he promised his daughters hed turn their favorite book into a movie -- and there are so few facets to him the movie borders on hagiography (when Disney takes a reluctant Travers to a visit to Disneyland the film also becomes an advertisement for its distributor). I wish Thompson would have had a little more fun with her portrayal of Travers -- theres no humor in her flintiness no sass to her constant dissatisfaction. When she pitches a fit at the proposal of casting Dick Van Dyke in the lead what should have been amusing comes off as annoying (imagine what Meryl Streep might have done with the role). But Thompson does manage to make Travers into a fascinating person -- a woman who refuses to compromise even if it means losing everything and doesnt care whom she offends in the process. Predictably by films end Travers icy heart will have melted a little (Paul Giamatti plays the chauffeur who gradually gets past her defenses) and the film of course became a huge success -- cartoon penguins and all. But outside of hardcore Mary Poppins fans who will relish the behind-the-scenes look at how the movies famous songs were composed and the characters designed most people will come away from Saving Mr. Banks feeling like they just sat through a feature-length ad for the magic of Walt Disney with Travers life tacked on as an afterthought.

"Saving Mr. Banks 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Saving Mr. Banks 4 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Mary Poppins one of 25 films to be preserved By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Dec 18 2013 1219 PM ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a Disney movie about a Disney movie that includes among its characters Walt Disney. I think they call that branding. Or maybe self-promotion I dont know. But its still a good movie buoyed by good performances from Emma Thompson Tom Hanks and almost as an afterthought an especially affecting Colin Farrell. Disney scholars may scoff that its not a warts-and-all portrayal of the struggle to bring ""Mary Poppins"" to the screen but that seems almost churlish in light of the enthusiasm Hanks brings to the film or the eventually melting icy facade Thompson puts up. This is exactly what Disney wants me to think isnt it? Eh so be it. Disney as you may know has a reputation for being somewhat um protective of its legacy its brand its products its place in the universe -- which is from the companys perspective at the top of the heap looking down on everything else. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" and its director John Lee Hancock dont do anything to change that exactly. But it does allow for a mild critique of the Disney method which typically entails using adorable animation and catchy songs to soften the sharp edges of fairy tales and legends. ""Poppins"" author P.L. Travers (Thompson) evidently had some sharp edges indeed. As the story opens her book sales have ground to a halt. She has resisted for about 20 years the advances of Walt Disney (Hanks) to turn her beloved novel into a film. Disneys daughters loved the book it seems and he promised them he would make a movie of it. Travers has turned up her haughty nose at every offer Disney has made. Now however she is obliged to accept with several conditions. Not only does she have script approval she demands that despite Disneys insistence the film will not be a musical and will not feature any animation. Perhaps you have seen the movie. ... She eventually sits down to work with screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and reluctantly the songwriting team of Robert and Richard Sherman (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman delightful). Her misery is palpable and she complains at every turn. Disney pops in from time to time to try to spur her on with mixed results. What becomes clear over time (and early on for the audience thanks to non-stop flashbacks) is where Travers reluctance to change her story comes from her upbringing in Australia where she began life as Helen Lyndon Goff the daughter of a loving but hopelessly alcoholic father (Farrell) whom she loved dearly. Thus when Disney insists that Mr. Banks the father of the family whom Mary Poppins works for must have a mustache we understand why Travers hits the roof. We also see what Mr. Banks looks like in the film which is a good indication of where the ultimate power in this relationship lies. Yet no victory for either side comes easy. Disney is desperate to make the film (which was released in 1964 and would become one of his studios biggest hits). And Hanks at the end of the film delivers a soliloquy about the power of storytelling that reminds you of how great Hanks can be. But really its Thompsons movie. A recording of the real Travers working with the songwriters and screenwriter both amuses because it sounds like she really was a pill to work with and intrigues -- it sounds like there was more to her character than what ""Saving Mr. Banks"" has shown us. As it exists though its still an interesting look at the Disney method -- Disney doesnt shy away from extolling the virtues of the very things Travers hates and even takes her on a tour of Disneyland -- and the making of a beloved film. Just dont get Travers started on Dick Van Dykes accent. ... Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks. Hollywood rarely sends itself a valentine much less a Christmas card but Saving Mr. Banks a mouthful of cotton candy about the persistent problems and insurmountable obstacles Walt Disney endured for 20 years trying to get Mary Poppins on the screen is the kind of Disney entertainment the great man himself would have loved constructed for the family market and wrapped in tinsel for the holiday season. The fact that it is entirely predictable historically questionable and replete with the Disney philosophy that everything in life--no matter how sad or sordid--deserves a happy ending is almost beside the point. In a time of dark cynical hopped-up movies about sex violence and hopelessness it adds some joy to a dismal year. Get your sugarplum early. It begins in 1961 when Disney (a mustachioed Tom Hanks) finally persuades P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) the brittle prune-faced author of the Mary Poppins books to travel from London to California to oversee preproduction plans for the movie without signing over the movie rights. Then it intercuts the parallel narrative of her childhood in Australia showing a little girl in the outback in 1906 restaging incidents in her life that inspired the characters in her stories. Born Helen Goff in 1899 she escaped a rough hardscrabble life and immigrated to England in 1924 where she wrote her first book about the flying nanny in 1934 under the pen name Travers which was her fathers first name. It was her unquenchable passion for her father (a dashing but tragic Colin Farrell in the calmest and most moving performance of his career) that forged the character of Mr. Banks the patriarch who hires Mary Poppins to look after his children. Based on both Peter Pan and her umbrella-carrying aunt (Rachel Griffiths) who kept the family in one piece after her father succumbed to alcohol and illness the flying nanny called Mary Poppins provided the sort of perfect G-rated literary sitcom narrative only Disney could have envisioned for the screen. There was just one titanic problem P. L. Travers herself. Distrustful of movies in general and suspicious of Disney in particular Travers implacably refused to sell her work to the persistent mogul but reluctantly agreed at last to make the exploratory trip to the land of oranges and idiots. From the minute she arrived she was nothing but trouble--selfish caustic exasperating and insulting to everyone who crossed her path. She was not at all amused by the fake cheerfulness at the studio or the toys and stuffed Disney animals planted in her suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She was even less charmed by the informality of ""Uncle Walt"" himself. But after 30 years of Mary Poppins books now in a sales decline she at least decided to investigate the possibility of a film version with myriad restrictions ""I wont have her turned into one of your silly cartoons"" Her demands included no singing no music no animation and total script approval. The biggest challenge was to convince her it would indeed make a wonderful musical. Rejecting every word in the proposed script turning every studio department into turmoil she swept through the Disney lot Mickey Mouse built like a mean-spirited rat catcher. She abhorred sentiment whimsy and show tunes. She didnt mind Julie Andrews because she was British but refused to approve Dick Van Dyke. Under no circumstances would she allow the use of the color red. She terrorized the Sherman brothers who wrote the score. One of the funniest moments is the look on Emma Thompsons stern face when they audition their first song. Its a frown of pure arsenic. If she couldnt tolerate ""Chim-Chim-Cheree"" imagine how the songwriters dreaded her inevitable reaction to ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."" No wonder it took two decades to acquire the rights to Mary Poppins and then it almost never got made. This is the crowd-pleasing behind-the-camera saga of that 1964 classic that catalogues detail by detail why. The screenplay by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith seamlessly captures two different eras with overlapping story lines that never intrude or confuse. Directed by John Lee Hancock with imagination and a flair for period details the 1961 Hollywood scenes on the bustling Disney lot in Burbank have a delicious retro feel that recreates the fashions foibles and feelings of period movies. (Throw them an idea and the Sherman brothers knock out Oscar-winning songs in less time than it takes to phone Chasens for take-out chili.)  The Australian flashbacks contrast the dark shadow of death inside P. L. Travers crude claustrophobic home with the blinding sunshine and sand of the pioneering outdoors. Compare the sunny optimism of the talking Pinocchios and wisecracking Plutos Disney sold to children with the despair of a real child whose father was always getting fired from his banking jobs always running out of money and drinking himself to death like the charming but irresponsible father in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and you see clearly why Travers wanted to save the tarnished reputation of her own cherished father imagined in her likeable but troubled Mr. Banks character from ridicule. The acting is top drawer although I could do without Tom Hanks big speech about the power of storytelling in movies with fairy-tale realism. Good as he is its Ms. Thompsons movie but even her calm and sturdy grip on the role fails to make Travers much more than a pickle-faced bully. Maybe she knew too much about the facts. There were times during the film when I got so tired of all the Dumbos and Bambis that I sided with her myself. But I surrendered to the films overall sweetness anyway and ended up smiling. It would be unconstitutional not to. What I dont buy is the movies fictionalized premise that what transformed P. L. Travers from cold marble and awakened her dormant heart was her dubious friendship with her limousine driver (Paul Giamatti) after he tells her about how much Mary Poppins meant to his disabled daughter. And we are asked to believe she changed her mind her personality and her firm grip on the Mary Poppins film rights--as well as the financial future of Walt Disney Productions--after taking her first ride on a merry-go-round at Disneyland. Its the kind of historical altercation that could only be made by the folks at Disney in honor of their founding father. The movies requisite happy ending with the author attending the Hollywood premiere bedecked in smiles is anything but accurate. In actual fact as many Disney biographies have made clear she hated the Hollywood experience Disney and the finished movie especially the dancing penguins. Before she died when Cameron MacIntosh sought her approval for the Broadway stage production of Mary Poppins her one stipulation was that no Americans be involved in any way. On the 50th anniversary of Mary Poppins Im still wondering what P. L. Travers thought of ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."" SAVING MR.

Cliched but well done and very moving. Francoissaid on Saturday January 11 2014 102857 AMTo Mike... Its kind of inferred that she would end up liking Walt Disney... and I think the film was actually made to show that it wasnt that easy to convince PL Travers not to show otherwise... or show another ending where she still didnt like him which we knew it was the case because if that wasnt there wouldnt be any Mary Poppins. I found the film to be enchanting and Emma Thompson was really hilarious. I agree with Richard. Mikesaid on Saturday December 28 2013 21710 PMI am usually in agreement with Richard in his reviews. Here is a rare time where I could not disagree with him more. This movie is just plain terrible. Though it is based on a true story this movie seemed to be made up. From the second I saw PL Travers and what a dislikeable person she is I knew she would change her mind and realize Walt Disney is not such a bad guy after all.

By Anthony Lane Joaquin Phoenix stars in a new movie directed by Spike Jonze.   Credit Illustration by Owen Freeman The hero of ""Her"" should be Him. Instead he bears the name of Theodore Twombly who sounds like the kind of nebbish that Preston Sturges used to dream up in his bath. Theodore is played by Joaquin Phoenix complete with a tragicomic mustache and a selection of unwise shirts. Those are not his fault but the fashion of the day like the high-waisted pants worn by all the men. Spike Jonzes movie which was shot in Los Angeles and Shanghai is set in a near but dateless future where the rough edges of existence have been rubbed away. The colors of clothes and furnishings though citrus-bright are diluted by the pastel softness of the lighting so that nothing hurts the eye. People ride in smoothly humming trains not belching cars. And Theodores cell phone reminds you of those slender vintage cases for cigarettes and visiting cards; if the ghost of Steve Jobs is watching he will glow a covetous green. This little flat box plus an earpiece that Theodore plugs in whenever he wakes up or cant sleep is his portal. It links him to OS1 ""the first artificially intelligent operating system"" which is newly installed on his computer. More than that ""its a consciousness"" with a voice of your choice and a rapidly evolving personality which grows not like a baby or a library but like an unstoppable alien spore. Theodores version is called Samantha and practically her first request is ""You mind if I look through your hard drive?"" She tidies his e-mails reads a book in two-hundredths of a second fixes him up on a date and when that goes badly has sex with him--aural sex so to speak but Theodore will take what he can get. No surprise really given that the role of Samantha is spoken by Scarlett Johansson. Had Jonze picked the voice of Marge Simpson say the film would have turned out very differently. As with all good science fiction the plot is locked into the moral and physical landscape. That is why Theodores friends are unfazed by his other half. Paul (Chris Pratt) proposes a double date with his girlfriend who chats to Samantha through the camera eye on Theodores phone while for Amy (Amy Adams) who already works in video-gaming and who has split from her dolt of a husband the notion of computer-generated desire sounds ideal. The only dissenter is Catherine (Rooney Mara) who was married to Theodore. They are finalizing their divorce and over lunch she mocks the solipsism of his new relationship. Mara is smart casting here; she more or less reprises her role from ""The Social Network"" in which she called Mark Zuckerberg an asshole and makes you wonder how far it is from Facebook to a world in which Theodore is the norm. What makes ""Her"" so potent is that it does to us what Samantha does to Theodore. We are informed cosseted and entertained and yet we are never more than a breath away from being creeped out. Just because someone browses your correspondence in a mood of flirtatious bonhomie doesnt make her any less invasive; and just because you have invited her to do so doesnt mean that you are in control. Who would have guessed after a year of headlines about the N.S.A. and about the porousness of life online that our worries on that score--not so much the political unease as a basic ontological fear that our inmost self is possibly up for grabs--would be best enshrined in a weird little romance by the man who made ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are""? And it is romantic Theodore and Samantha click together as twin souls not caring that one soul is no more than a digital swarm. Sad kooky and daunting in equal measure ""Her"" is the right film at the right time. It brings to full bloom what was only hinted at in the polite exchanges between the astronaut and HAL in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and toward the end as Samantha joins forces with like minds in cyberspace it offers a seductive nonviolent answer to Skynet the system in the ""Terminator"" films that attacked its mortal masters. We are easy prey not least when we fall in love. The human heart is where the tame things are. After watching ""Her"" why bother with ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""? The problem is not just that ""Her"" is a better film but that its a better Walter Mitty film--a more ambitious way of addressing the state of Mittyhood. When James Thurber published the original story in this magazine in 1939 it lasted for two pages and nothing happened; Mitty drove around town with his wife. His exploits--as a fighter ace as a surgeon and so on--stayed inside his head and refused to spring free. If his name has endured it is because his plight is eternal. His ancestor was J. Alfred Prufrock who talked of ""sea-girls wreathed with seaweed"" but never met any which was probably a good thing and his descendant is Theodore Twombly who can lie alone and sweet-talk his beloved without having to risk a kiss. All of which is tough on the new Walter Mitty played by Ben Stiller. This Walter does have reveries including the rescue of a three-legged dog from an exploding building but they dwindle after half an hour leaving Stiller--who directs as well as stars--to fill the time. The same dilemma greeted Danny Kaye when he took the role in 1947. Having exhausted his heroic imagination Walter swelled into an actual hero for the rest of the movie and the same applies here as he jets to Greenland and Afghanistan leaps from helicopters and tussles with sharks. So much for Mitty the non-achiever. At least Kaye was up against a decent villain Boris Karloff no less whose opening line was ""I know of a way to kill a man and leave no trace."" Stillers manly task is--wait for it--to find an errant photographer (Sean Penn) who doesnt have a cell phone. I thought I would faint from excitement. The result may be the oddest film of the season. It boasts an array of sublime backdrops and a yearning score but the climate of feeling is anxious and inward encapsulated in Stillers darting gaze and the movie itself keeps glancing backward at the lost and the obsolete. Walter works at Life which is closing down and preparing its farewell issue. His grail as he hops the globe is a single negative from a strip of 35-mm. film. This air of elegy infects the story and sucks the fun out of it. It kills a beautiful idea and leaves no trace. There are two stories in ""Saving Mr. Banks."" The first begins in 1961 at the end of a twenty-year campaign by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) to bring ""Mary Poppins"" to the screen. Hitherto the author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) has stated that she will not be moved lest Mary and her other creations be traduced or stretched into what she calls ""silly cartoons."" Now however in need of money she flies to Los Angeles there to be wooed into signing. In short this is not a film about a film but a film about winning the rights to a book. In fifty years time will audiences thrill to ""J. K. Rowling and the Contractual Clause of Fire""? The other story of which we see frequent clips in our heroines memory unfolds in Australia in 1906 where the young Travers--whose actual name was Helen Goff--moves with her family to a farmhouse. She has a harassed mother (Ruth Wilson) and an alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) who works in a bank and whom despite everything she adores. His first name is Travers which explains a lot. Indeed the entire movie is less of a drama and more of a prolonged explanation lightly therapeutic and Poppins-neat. The cause of Traverss long-concealed distress and its blithe effect on her fiction and on Disneys eventual film are clipped together as crisply as a hook and eye. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is itself a Disney product and you have to admire its nerveless promotional chutzpah--the way in which the narrative arc bends upward after Travers has been whisked to Disneyland and the tender (though invented) visit that Walt pays to her London home. It is the case that she was upset at the premiere of ""Mary Poppins"" though the tears that we see were not an outpouring of catharsis as the new film suggests but a burst of exasperation. And yet ""Saving Mr. Banks"" does the trick. We have to endure Colin Farrell who looks uncomfortable sounds un-Australian and even makes an unconvincing drunk. On the other hand theres a kick and a lilt to the scenes in which Travers ears pricked for solecism listens to the Sherman brothers (B. J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman) as they canter through their songs. The director is John Lee Hancock who does what he did with ""The Blind Side"" where he commandeered a true and jagged tale tidied up the trauma and made sure that everyone lived sappily ever after. Sandra Bullock carried the day then and now Emma Thompson repeats the process. ""Sun came out to say hello to you"" Traverss driver (Paul Giamatti) says as she arrives in Los Angeles. ""Dont be preposterous"" she replies and the movie is revived by that testiness and wit--the same qualities that rang through the fantastical briskness of the Poppins novels. Just as Mary rescued the wilting Banks family so Thompson saves the film. A spoonful of her medicine makes the sugar go down.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Saving Mr. Banks starring Tom Hanks reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Saving Mr. Banks Too Much Sugar Not Enough Medicine Saving Mr. Banks Too Much Sugar Not Enough Medicine Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 13 2013 636 PM Saving Mr. Banks Itll leave you feeling something short of supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. By Dana Stevens Tom Hanks in Saving Mr. Banks Stlll from Saving Mr. Banks (C) Disney. All rights reserved. Its a pleasing coincidence that the prestige studio picture Saving Mr. Banks--a Disney release in which Walt Disney figures as a major character--came out the same year as Escape From Tomorrow a gnarly little underground horror film that was self-financed by its director (newcomer Randy Moore) and filmed in part by a guerilla-style undercover film crew at Disneys Magic Kingdom. Escape from Tomorrow  (which I thought made for a better idea and poster than actual movie though some disagreed) explored some of the unsettling fears and fantasies bound up in Americans lasting devotion to that ubiquitous white-gloved mouse and his well-policed fixedly sunny utopia. Saving Mr. Banks directed by John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) does just the opposite It seeks to soothe its audience to reassure us (as Tom Hanks benevolent Walt Disney keeps reassuring Emma Thompsons uptight P.L. Travers) that if we just sit back and let Disney take charge everything will be fine. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. And everything is I guess if youre looking for a straightforwardly soapy comic melodrama that revisits a little-known moment in Hollywood history through a pleasantly nostalgic (and beautifully art-directed) scrim. But theres something obscurely creepy about this movies attempt to rewrite P.L. Travers decades-long standoff with Walt Disney over the rights to Mary Poppins as a kind of sexless meet-cute rom-com in which the twinkly eyed but iron-willed Walt slowly wins over the disapproving Mrs. Travers (as she insists on being called despite his repeated attempts to address her familiarly as ""Pam."") As the audience already knows Disney won the standoff Mary Poppins did eventually get made into a movie one that was a worldwide smash upon its release in 1964 and went on to win five Academy Awards and become a childrens classic. Travers made no secret of her dislike for the finished film (although Saving Mr. Banks suggests in one key scene that she may have been dissembling). If Mary Poppins was too sentimental and pandering a movie for Travers taste one trembles to imagine her reaction to Saving Mr. Banks which uses her artistic battles with the Disney production team as an unlikely springboard to Oprah-esque self-discovery. Its 1961 and Travers advised by her agent to sell the rights to Disney before she runs out of savings and loses her beloved London house reluctantly travels to Los Angeles to have a sitdown with the films prospective creative team. That team consists of Disney himself the screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and the films songwriters brothers Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak). In their early meetings Mrs. Travers is a nightmare stiff-backed snobbish and condescending she shoots down every idea from the casting of Dick Van Dyke as Bert to a set design that differs in the smallest detail from the Cherry Tree Lane of her imagination. Gradually Mrs. Travers begins to be won over by the irresistible songs the Sherman brothers are churning out by the day (we witness parts of the composition process of ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" ""Feed the Birds"" and ""Lets Go Fly a Kite"") but she continues to hold firm on one stipulation No animated dancing penguins or she walks. Hanks avuncular Disney and Thompsons prim Travers are too bland to strike sparks either off one another or in the viewers imagination. Advertisement During those long hours in the writers room Mrs. Travers needs to daydream about something so her mind wanders to her troubled childhood in Australia (in fact the film begins there in the first of an endless succession of honey-hued flashbacks). Played as a little girl by Annie Rose Buckley she was once the daughter of Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) a spontaneous and adoring but hopelessly alcoholic father whose inability to hold down a job left his family downwardly mobile and his wife (Ruth Wilson) angry and depressed. The screenplay aims to draw a parallel between the middle-aged Mrs. Travers unresolved feelings toward her long-deceased father and the onscreen fate of Mr. Banks the absentee work-obsessed father of the children Mary Poppins takes care of. But the analogy never sticks The overly industrious Mr. Banks bears little resemblance to the wastrel Travers Goff who if anything needed to spend less time flying kites with his children. And the films title notwithstanding very little time is spent on the process of developing Mr. Banks character or much else in the Mary Poppins script. If the 30-plus minutes of screen time devoted to those Australia flashbacks--including multiple slo-mo father-daughter horseback rides and soulful drunken apologies from Farrell--had been spent exploring what it was like to collaborate on a script with Walt Disney this might have been an interesting process film about the intersection between art and commerce in midcentury American entertainment. Instead the film Mary Poppins--from which we see a few short clips in a late scene--is treated mainly as a means to an end a stepping stone on P.L. Travers path toward embracing her inner child. For a movie thats all about what a swell idea it was to adapt Mary Poppins for the screen Saving Mr. Banks seems remarkably uninterested in what made the movie special. I will give Saving Mr. Banks this Its lavish production design makes life on the Disney backlot in 1961 look as candy-colored and deliciously artificial as it must have been. It features several rollicking in-studio performances of those timeless Sherman brothers songs. And it stars Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks two beloved veteran actors who make for agreeable company even when the characters theyre playing have been purged of every quality that might have made them interesting. (P.L. Travers bisexuality and fascination with Eastern religions spring to mind as does Disneys alleged anti-Semitism and his resistance to working with women in positions of power.) But Hanks avuncular Disney and Thompsons prim fussy Travers are too idealized and bland to strike sparks either off one another or in the viewers imagination. Their characters lack that tincture of real-life bitterness that would help us to choke down this giant spoonful of sugar. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 13 2013 Save for later Saved Tom Hanks as Walt Disney (l.) and Emma Thompson as author P.L. Travers in a scene from Saving Mr. Banks. Francois Duhamel/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Emma Thompson plays P.L. Travers the author of the book ""Mary Poppins"" in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" and she is anything but warm and fuzzy. Frosty and snippy is closer to the mark. The film directed by John Lee Hancock and written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith dramatizes the difficulties Walt Disney played here with gentle rigor by Tom Hanks encountered when he attempted to wrangle Travers into relinquishing the rights to her book. Since Travers despises animation and what she characterizes as Disney ""treacle"" the challenge is daunting.Through flashbacks to her childhood the filmmakers attempt to give Travers who grew up in Australia with a beloved but alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) some resonant low notes to counteract the shrill high ones in the early 1960s scenes. But the sequences with Travers berating her Disney collaborators and Uncle Walt himself are the liveliest. Thompson is very good at playing imperious and she even manages an unexpected trace of flirtiness in a few offhanded moments with Hanks. Travers was a handful and the movie though far from hard-hitting gives her her ornery due. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including some unsettling images.)

Travers in this soapy but potent fiction about the making of the Mary Poppins movie By Richard Corliss Dec. 12 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Francois Duhamel / Disney Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Walt Disney and P.L. Travers didnt get along. She fought his attempts to make a film musical of her Mary Poppins books and he didnt invite her to the 1964 Hollywood premiere; she flew in from London on her own to see the movie -- and hated it. The picture earned hundreds of millions of dollars and eight Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Actress (Julie Andrews) and Best Song and Score by Robert and Richard Sherman. But Travers felt so scarred by the Disney experience that she refused to sanction any Poppins movie sequels. When producer Cameron Mackintosh proposed a stage musical version of the film that had made her fortune Travers insisted that the Sherman brothers still active not be involved in writing new songs. The collision of the imperious British bisexual and the master manipulator from Kansas City could make for a sour-spirited expose like Clint Eastwoods J. Edgar. We might be treated to the volcanic struggle between an artist and his powerful patron -- say Charlton Hestons Michelangelo and Rex Harrisons Pope Julius II in The Agony and the Ecstasy. But the sponsor of Saving Mr. Banks which stars Emma Thompson as Travers and Tom Hanks as Disney is the Walt Disney Company which has positioned the movie to be a Christmas heartwarmer and a feature-length corporate self-tribute. (MORE Richard Zoglin on the Stage Musical of Mary Poppins) Whatever the character ambiguities in the original script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith (once included in the Blacklist of best unproduced screenplays) you can guess that Disney put it through the same severe vetting process that Travers applied to Walts Mary Poppins adaptation. Banks director John Lee Hancock last movie was The Blind Side another reality-adjacent fable of a strong personality (Sandra Bullocks Leigh Anne Tuohy) overwhelming a stubborn one (Quinton Aarons teen football prospect Michael Oher). Hancock applies his Blind Side strategy of Valentine vampirism -- he goes for both the heart and the throat -- to Banks assuring from the start that Mrs. T. doesnt stand a chance. I can hear Walt from his cryogenic crypt protesting ""Its a movie for Petes sake"" And the standard biopic certainly this one is at its best a simplified form of biography. Far less than best Saving Mr. Banks can be accused of whitewashing Walt even as he brainwashes Travers -- and of submitting its audience to the same emotional pressure. But the picture finally succeeds as the kind of fantasy that its two main characters consorted in individually and on one project together. (WATCH Emma Thompson Talks About the Dark Sides of P.L. Travers and Walt Disney) The veddy English Travers born Helen Goff in Australia took her pen name from her father Travers Goff an Irish banker in the Outback. This is the setting for the movies parallel story set in 1906 and interwoven with the scenes in 1961 London and Burbank. The flashbacks which are bathed in Nativity lighting and consume about 40 minutes of the two-hour film paint Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) as a convivial gent with big dreams who is driven to poverty and early death by his love of liquor. One sees this doting father and thinks of Johnny Nolan the singing waiter played by James Dunn in Elia Kazans 1945 film of the Betty Smith memoir-novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. And like Johnnys daughter Francie (Peggy Ann Garner) the girl Helen must come to realize that the man she adores is an alcoholic failure with doom as his destiny. Francie-Smith would overcome her loss by growing up to write a book about her family; Helen-Travers would transform her father into the harried sympathetic Mr. Banks and her take-charge aunt (Rachel Griffiths) into Mary Poppins the practical sorceress who becomes the Banks childrens nanny. (MORE Our 1934 Review of the First Mary Poppins Book by Subscribing to TIME) Walt Disney whose father Elias sent the boy into the cold with tattered shoes and strapped him when he returned home came to Hollywood and promoted a nostalgic fantasy of America in his movies and his theme parks. His link to Travers neither of these two creators could abide what was. In genius fits of DIY psychiatry they bent their harsh memories into the airiest artistic illusions. One wrote the other built dreams of what should have been. Thats why their works are still popular 79 years since the publication of the first Poppins book and nearly a half-century after Walt Disneys death. If there were a P.L. Travers Studio to produce Saving Mr. Banks we might have a different perspective. Hanks asked what Travers opinion of the film about her might be replied ""She would absolutely hate it"" But this movie is to cite Richard Schickels shrewd 1968 book The Disney Version. Indeed the Disney Theme Park version -- a scenic ride with a few curves and dips that seamlessly blends sentiment and Walts anachronistic world view. Travers slightly more acerbic take on life in her Poppins books is the eye-drop of medicine in Walts canister full of sugar. (MORE The TIME Review of Richard Schickels 1968 Book The Disney Version) From the start Travers and Walt are classic dont-invite-ems. She insists on being addressed as ""Mrs. Travers;"" he invariably calls her Pamela or Pam. He wants to be ""Walt;"" she says ""Mr. Disney."" Potato potahto -- and shes all starch. Loading the case against Travers the movie presents her as the standard frigid woman in need of thawing. Stern of mien popping her plosives like grenades her lips welded into a grimace of disapproval she growls at the parents of young children and complains about the balmy Los Angeles sunshine. (Thompsons portrayals are usually heartier and more delicate than this cartoon of pruny wrath.) Travers could be an ancestor of Cate Blanchetts character in Blue Jasmine the haughty foreigner who comes to California and collides with its laid-back manners. As depicted here the Disney studio in Burbank might be the Shire and its employees all those hobbits who never left home. Travers closest collaborators on the project -- screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and the Sherman brothers (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) -- are unfailingly cheerful and polite to the crabby Mrs. T.; they rarely sink into despair though she often pushes them in that direction and never rise to fury. Walts secretary Tommie (Kathy Baker) has the sunny spunk of a 30s movie working-girl like Glenda Farrell or Una Merkel. Tommie protects her boss when someone wants to barge into his office while hes sneaking a cigarette and keeps steering him toward his best instincts. (MORE TIMEs 1964 Review of Disneys Mary Poppins Movie) The strangest Disney denizen is Travers driver Ralph played by Paul Giamatti. Like the movies Travers and Walt Ralph harbors a secret pain a disabled daughter whose struggles give him strength. Described by producer Ian Collie as an amalgam of several Disney drivers Ralph is really a fiction of the films writers. Says Giamatti ""They needed a relaxed kind human being which is exactly what Ralph is."" He is more a beatific Buddha who deflects Travers cynicism with satori her wrath with a wreath of smiles. Imagine the polar opposite of the pure-evil slave-vendor whom Giamatti incarnates in 12 Years a Slave and you have the angelic ethereal possibly sedated Ralph who could exist nowhere other than in a Disney film. The plots dialectic like everything else in the film gets spelled out in the dialogue. ""Mary Poppins and the Bankses"" Travers says ""theyre family to me."" Not like family; family. Actual relatives -- her father and aunt. Walt is just as determined. ""I love Mary Poppins."" he dewily tells the author. ""And you youve got to share her with me."" The movie essentially describes a custody battle over the nanny; and before seeing the movie we know who wins. Mrs. Travers will say yes either by being converted or through grudging acquiescence. (MORE The Entrepreneurial Genius of Walt Disney) The miscreant Mrs. T. takes a while to see the light. Finding a fruit basket and dozens of Disney plush toys in her Beverly Hills Hotel room she loads the playthings in a closet and shies the fruit out her window toward the pool -- a preposterously heedless gesture for the character but one referenced in the fruit lying around Helens Outback home. The toys will return too Travers having flown back in anger to London sits alone in her flat her only companion a four-foot-high Mickey Mouse plush toy that she brought home with her. (Come On) As in tatty B-movies about rock n roll from the 50s through both versions of Footloose the moment must arrive when the puritanical adults start tapping their feet at the music the kids love. For Travers in the movie its ""Lets Go Fly a Kite"" the climactic number that liberates Mr. Banks from his propriety and servitude -- and is meant to prove to Travers that the Shermans understand the autobiographical touchstone of her books. Okay we accept that connection. But Travers must also be ground down to accept every aspect of the Disney theocracy at the Hollywood premiere she enters the theater on the arm of a Mickey figure as large as she. We are reminded of Harvey Kurtzmans 1954 Mad comic-book parody ""Mickey Rodent"" in which ""Darnold Duck"" sputters that ""Somehow ... the idea of a mouse ... 10 times bigger than the biggest rat ... this idea has always made me sick"" (MORE Corlisss Tribute to Harvey Kurtzmans Mad) The film argues that this defeat of Travers will (which never happened) was a triumph of Walts charm. Audiences not only know she sold Disney the rights to her first novel they want to see her agree to do it; otherwise the world would have been deprived of a movie it loved and loves. Yet Hancock Hanks and Thompson hint at a subtler shade that Travers a follower of the spiritualist George Gurdjieff (in the movie she is seen holding one of his books) was virtually mesmerized by the swami Walt. In the scene of Walt telling Travers that she must ""share"" Mary Poppins with him Thompson actually flinches as if shes ever so briefly enchanted by his hypnotic charm and must exert herself to snap out of it. A supreme salesman shaman or Svengali Walt will get what he wants. And Saving Mr. Banks will by hook or by crook -- actually by crook -- sell the hokum of its script to many a skeptic in the crowd. Me for example. Watching the movie twice and recoiling at every encounter of irresistible force and immovable object I finally gave in around the time Walt confides in Mrs. T. the memory of his rough childhood. (Or invents it. Who can say?) The critic in me acknowledges that Hanks brings an actors art to this anecdote the gentility of his manner colliding with and enriching the storys poignancy. The eight-year-old girl in me suppressed tears then let em flow even as I condemned both the movie for its ability to tap plangent emotions through trash art and my suggestible self for falling for it. I fought the feeling like a waterboard victim surrendering when the torturers found my weakness creamy nostalgia deftly applied. (MORE Tom Hanks on TIMEs List of Top 10 Movie Performances for 2013) ""Extraordinary how potent cheap music is"" said Noel Coward in Private Lives. He meant the best 1920s pop songs -- the whole grand silly symphony. Bad popular art can be potent too in spurts. Saving Mr. Banks tries to turn a lie about securing a books film rights into a parable about St. Walt and the Dragon Lady. I hereby denounce the movie and all its works (except for Hanks). But for a few moments there I was like the movies P.L. Travers helpless under the Disney spell.

Travers unlikely artistic partners in Saving Mr. Banks (DISNEY) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 13 2013 at 518 AM updated December 13 2013 at 519 AM comments In the new movie ""Saving Mr. Banks"" P.L Travers arrives in Los Angeles to sell Walt Disney the rights to adapt her book ""Mary Poppins"" -- once she gets an idea of what they really plan to do to it. She does and she finds it appalling. The set designs turn her middle-class family into aristocrats. The casting of Dick Van Dyke as a cockney chimneysweep is absurd. The lyrics dont scan properly. And dancing cartoon penguins? Why on earth are there dancing cartoon penguins? And of course sitting in the audience were supposed to smile at her stuffy completely wrong-headed views. I wanted to cheer her on. Van Dyke is still a loose-limbed treasure but is Bert werent likely to fool no one eh guvnor? The Banks is family is posher than it should be. The songs -- well anything sounds wonderful sung by Julie Andrews. But the penguins. Why do there have to be penguins? The thing is Travers was right. She was also a lot more interesting than this movie wants to let on. Were supposed to see her as a bit of a scold a stuffy old maid who only warmed up thanks to ""the happiest place on Earth."" In fact she was a rather bohemian lady who toured as an actress hung out with Yeats studied mysticism and in her 70s took off two years to go off and live with the Hopi Indians. So she was not exactly an old fussbudget. But she used proper grammar and had good taste and these days I suppose thats what passes for stick-in-the-mud crankiness. The best part about ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is not surprisingly Emma Thompson who we never see enough of onscreen. She may not be playing the real P.L Travers here but she certainly brings both power and delicacy to the character shes given. Her acidulous take down of everything L.A. has to offer -- from perpetually perfect weather to bad tea -- is perfect. Theres also some real feeling to one of her last scenes with Disney when she reflects on what to her ""Mary Poppins"" is really all about. (As the title tells you its not the kids Marys there for -- its poor old Dad.) Tom Hanks however looks nothing like Walt Disney and the image-polishing given his character is pretty intense although hardly out of the ordinary for the studio which has previously released several admiring documentaries on itself. Disney is a place with a sense of history -- and a commitment to hagiography. Unfortunately ""Saving Mr. Banks"" also has a commitment to cliches and the supporting cast is full of types -- the long-suffering agent the old sardonic secretary the schlumpy but lovable chauffeur who is a font of home-spun wisdom. (Note to Paul Giamatti It wouldnt hurt you to occasionally turn down a role.) Add in the constant flashbacks to Travers rural Australian girlhood and life with her roguishly charming but undependable father (who died of influenza by the way not a long bout with TB but no matter) and you have a desperately Oscar-hungry contrivance whose only hope lies with the terrific Thompson. So see it for her if you must -- or if you must see it concentrate on her. Or better yet read one of Travers original books -- which dont come with cartoons but do come with a wonderful tribute to women who came into chaos and set things right. Ratings note The film contains alcohol abuse. Saving Mr. Banks (PG-13) Disney (126 min.) Directed by John Lee Hancock. With Emma Thompson Tom Hanks.

Russell film ""American Hustle."" A con man (Christian Bale) along with his seductive British partner (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent (Bradley Cooper). Also starring Jennifer Lawrence. (Photo Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Dec. 12 2013 140 p.m. ET Ho hum another holiday season and another great movie from David O. Russell. Last year it was ""Silver Linings Playbook"" which was sensationally fresh and funny. This year its ""American Hustle"" which is sensationally fresh and funny in different ways. How does the guy do it? Where does he find the energy--not just his own which seems to be infinitely renewable these days but the comic energy that sustains his five stars? All of them--Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner--are at the top of their game in a hurtling roundelay that Eric Singer and the director based ever so vaguely on Abscam the sting operation of the late 1970s and early 80s in which the FBI recruited known con artists to ensnare a motley assortment of crooked public servants. WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern reviews the seven-time Golden Globe nominee ""American Hustle."" Photo ""American Hustle""/Sony Pictures. ""Some of this actually happened"" a title card declares blithely at the start. It doesnt say ""Inspired By Real Events"" a claim thats usually a preface to distortions of fact in the name of dubious drama. This is fiction with a dramatic license that authorizes anything but boredom and the first scene a wordless and hilarious meditation on the theme of hair loss gives us a taste of whats to come. ""American Hustle"" is a celebration of the con from the hapless duplicity of a comb-over to the elaborate deceptions--and self-deceptions--of high-functioning hornswogglers bent on being anyone but who they actually are. The quicksilver plot is a function of evolving motives shifting allegiances and intricate betrayals. All I can tell you without resorting to flow charts is that Mr. Coopers Richie DiMaso a loose-cannon agent of the FBI dragoons Mr. Bales sleazy con man Irving Rosenfeld into organizing the government-funded con; that one of the operations targets is Carmine Polito a Jersey pol played by Mr. Renner; that Irvings partner in things amorous as well as criminal is a temptress named Sydney Prosser (Ms. Adams) and that his quick-witted floozy of a wife Ms. Lawrences Rosalyn bears watching at every step of the way. But then every one of these characters bears watching even though the film is too long and the pace is occasionally exhausting; better a surfeit of riches than no riches at all. (Danny Elfman did the music. The production was designed by Judy Becker. The cinematographer was Linus Sandgren.) ENLARGE Amy Adams left and Christian Bale in American Hustle Columbia Pictures The first thing you may notice about Irving is that hes flabby--or as Sydney says of him ""not necessarily in good shape."" Flab is new for Mr. Bale a shape-shifter who has made himself skeleton-thin on occasion. But whats truly new in his performance--indeed in his career--is the subtlety of his comic style. Instead of going for laughs the actor concentrates on Irvings antic self-seriousness and his ardor not to mention his bling. (In a vision of romance that comes out of nowhere Irving and Sydney embrace in the back of a dry-cleaning shop he owns while plastic-bagged clothes on mechanical tracks swirl around them.) Sydney is a changeling a sort of Sybil with multiple personalities minus most of the mental-health issues. Ms. Adams has been a changeling too in a wide range of roles. Yet shes newly spellbinding in the intensity she brings to Sydneys passion and fierce ambition. Related Bradley Cooper and Director David O. Russell Talk American Hustle As the driving force behind the sting Richie burns bright with a dim sense of ethics; in a criminal-intent contest between him and Irving its unclear who would win. Whats more he perms his hair as Sydney does with rollers that tell you all you need to know about his vanity. Mr. Cooper gives him a newer model of the motor-mouth he deployed in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" plus boundless mania; the FBI agent sprays cockeyed notions like a showerhead in a spa. A friend from New Jersey told me he couldnt buy Mr. Renner as the Elvis-haired mayor of Camden but Im from Jersey too and I bought him with pleasure. Ms. Lawrence as Rosalyn on the other hand is beyond price. Yes she was brilliant in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" last year. Still its astonishing that this almost-newly-minted movie star is appearing simultaneously this year as the action heroine of ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" and as a marvelously crafty wife and mother whos been reading a self-help book called ""The Power of Intention"" with the intention of prevailing come what may. Comedy seems to come naturally to her though so far theres no sign of anything in acting that doesnt. High-energy comedy comes naturally to the filmmaker. He exults in free association emotional riffs in the craziness that underlies ostensibly rational behavior. The crosscurrents have crosscurrents in his films but the current that carries everything along here is announced by the first strains of music from the screen Duke Ellingtons ""Jeeps Blues"" with one of the most exuberant passages in all of jazz. David O. Russell does buoyancy better than anyone. Watch a clip from the film ""Saving Mr. Banks."" Author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) reflects on her childhood while meeting with filmmaker Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) during production for the adaptation of her novel Mary Poppins. (Photo/Video Disney) Saving Mr. Banks ""Saving Mr. Banks"" wraps a seduction inside a seduction with enjoyable results. Its a Disney film in every sense of the term. The seduction in the story is conducted by Walt Disney himself; hes played with savvy verve and genial authority by Tom Hanks. (John Lee Hancock directed with a graceful touch.) The year is 1961 and Walt--as he urges everyone to call him--has decided that the time has finally come to secure the rights to ""Mary Poppins"" from the books creator P.L. Travers; shes played with sparkling wit and deliciously acidic scorn by Emma Thompson. Since Mrs. Travers--as she insists on being called--has steadfastly refused to have her characters sullied by what she sees as Hollywood vulgarity Walt invites her to fly from her home in London to Los Angeles. There during two weeks on the Disney lot he and his staff charm her cajole her and try to reassure her by showing her how they intend to bring Mary Poppins George Banks and all her other beloved characters to the screen. ENLARGE Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) shows Disneyland to Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) in Saving Mr. Banks. Disney This is a rich idea for a movie about a movie and the cultural combat between the purist author and the motion-picture maestro provides lively entertainment. Mrs. Travers is on the wrong side--the losing side that will prove to be the winning side since we know what a triumph Disneys ""Mary Poppins"" turned out to be. Still Ms. Thompson elevates every element of a notably astute script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith. As a killjoy railing about ""jollification"" she turns the remarkable trick of making Mrs. Travers insufferable and endearing at the same time. (The cinematographer John Schwartzman turns his own trick of shooting in a style that combines at appropriate times a modern palette with Disney-bright cheer.) ""Saving Mr. Banks"" isnt just a saga of seduction and persuasion. The film examines the roots of the Mary Poppins myth and thus the core of its authors personality. It does that by flashing back with relentless regularity to Maryborough Australia where Mrs. Travers was born as Helen Lyndon Goff in 1899. Although this structure draws simplistic inferences as pop-psychological explorations often do Colin Farrell gives a standout performance in a relatively small role as Helens volatile father a bank clerk with a drinking problem and the flashbacks prepare the way for irresistibly affecting passages in which Walt and Mrs. Travers find commonality in their troubled childhoods. But thats where the other seduction comes in. Were asked to accept these two bright forceful people as reasonable versions of their real-life counterparts. The accuracy of their arguments in the ""Mary Poppins"" production meetings is in fact supported by some startling audio tape that plays over the closing credits. Yet the movie does to them as historical figures what Mrs. Travers feared Disney would do to her book and its characters. Theres no hint of Walt Disneys reputation as a tyrant--hardly surprising given the productions provenenance--or of Mrs. Travers as the tortured soul she was. Edges have been softened harshness has been transformed into happiness sprinkled with eccentricity. And the paradox of course is that were glad to be seduced. As Disney films go this is a good one. Watch a clip ""The Hobbit"" film sequel ""The Desolation of Smaug"" featuring Evangeline Lilly as the elf Tauriel and Orlando Bloom reprising his role as Legolas from ""The Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug The news is greatly encouraging about the second installment of Peter Jacksons ""Hobbit"" trilogy but Ill keep it short. Making it long would mean going into all the dramatis personae and dramatis creaturae of the J.R.R. Tolkien tale and what the good guys were doing when last seen in Middle-earth on the way to reclaiming the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the dragon Smaug. Suffice it to say that Martin Freemans Bilbo Baggins and Ian McKellens Gandalf the Grey are back along with the 13 dwarves led by Richard Armitages Thorin Oakenshield and that the latest lap of their journey is far more focused and much more exciting than the last one. ENLARGE The character Azog in The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug Warner Bros. Pictures Thats because everything that needed establishing has been established so the journeyers hit the road in expeditious fashion and Mr. Jackson and his virtuoso colleagues stage much of the action with the visual vocabulary of a good old-fashioned chase. (Dwarves in barrels rub a dub dub escape their enemies by floating down a white-water river.) Theres a stronger feminine presence this time thanks to Evangeline Lillys Tauriel--600 years old and never more beautiful--and an awesome dragon presence thanks not only to Smaugs blast-furnace breath but to his sub-basso voice which was provided before subsequent digital fiddling by Benedict Cumberbatch. My advice to ""Hobbit"" fans is not only to see this one but to see it as I did in 3-D projected at the normal rate of 24 frames per second. The film will also be shown in whats called High Frame Rate 3-D at 48 frames a second but that made the last installment look more like video than a regular movie. Smaug is scary enough without a turbo boost. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ""The Grifters"" (1990) ENLARGE The movies no con; its the real thing. John Cusack giving one of the best performances of his career plays Roy Dillon a two-bit con man in love with Annette Bening and Anjelica Huston plays Roys steely mother in this deft tough-minded comedy from Donald E. Westlakes adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Stephen Frears directed a flawless cast that includes Stephen Tobolowsky Jimmy Noonan Henry Jones and Sandy Baron. Dennis Gassner designed the production. Elmer Bernstein did the music. The cinematographer was Oliver Stapleton. ENLARGE ""F For Fake"" (1973) Orson Welles was one of the most extravagantly gifted figures in the history of film. (He made ""Citizen Kane"" when he was in his mid-20s.) By his own account he was also a total fake. That account is enshrined in this filmed dissertation on the nature of hoaxes and hoaxers. Mr. Welles holds forth on other fakes among them the illustrious art forger Elmyr de Hory and his blithely crooked biographer Clifford Irving. Yet he reserves his richest scorn and his greatest delight for his mendacious capacious self. ENLARGE ""Nine Queens"" (2000) Theres no honor among the Buenos Aires thieves of ""Nine Queens"" a Spanish-language debut feature by Fabian Bielinsky. Its hard to tell the con man from the mark but thats what were asked to do after two swindlers join forces to sell a supposedly rare set of forged stamps. Ricardo Darin is Marcos an experienced scammer searching for a smart associate who can learn the tricks of the trade. I wasnt smart enough to see what was going on in Mr. Bielinskys Mamet-like house of mirrors until the very end.

Travers feared and loathed above all else was a Disney-fied version of the tale she wrote about a magical nanny.Ironically the story highlighting the clash of wills between Travers (Emma Thompson) and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has undergone its own embellished Disneyfication in Saving Mr. Banks ( out of four; rated PG-13 opening Friday in select cities).Travers would have despised it. For the rest of us its an entertaining affecting deftly acted saga interspersed with illustrative flashbacks from Travers childhood. But a biopic it is not.It may not fully romanticize Walt Disney but it does add a sugary spoonful to his contentious relationship with Travers implying there was a conciliatory resolution.STORY Tom Hanks Emma Thompson duel in Saving Mr. BanksMORE Icons collide in Walt Disney taleREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersMOVIE CALENDAR DecemberFrom all accounts Travers remained bitter until her death at 96 about the musical made from her book. She reportedly approached Disney at the movies premiere in 1964 insisting he remove a key scene with Dick Van Dyke. .Disneys avuncular manner and distinctive voice are cleverly captured by the ever-affable Hanks. Those who knew Disney can best say if his persona was softened.. But the character of Travers (nee Helen Goff) is leavened with nary a 1/4 teaspoonful of sweetener.Ill-tempered and acid-tongued Travers defends her intellectual property more vigorously than the most assiduous lawyer.Alternating between disgruntled consternation and a scowl Thompson is fabulous as the author who must sell the rights to her beloved book due to money problems.Her fears of Poppins perversion into a cartoon or a too-cheery portrayal are unceasing.""Shell be cavorting and twinkling and grinning toward a happy ending like a kamikaze"" natters Travers.She heartily rejects a warbling Poppins.""Mary Poppins absolutely does not sing"" Travers argues. ""Shes not a giddy woman. She doesnt jig about. I wont have her be one of your silly cartoons.""But as history shows Disney prevailed.She called him ""a trickster a fraudster a sneak.""He called her Pam -- though she insisted on being addressed as Mrs. Travers.She wasnt always so surly and demanding. An exuberant child growing up in Australia her imagination was sparked by a charismatic father (Colin Farrell) who loved poetry.While it glosses over facts and skips a few decades in Travers life the film powerfully explores how art can be influenced by childhood trauma.As a girl Travers was entranced but also emotionally wounded by her mercurial alcoholic father who influenced the character of Poppins Mr. Banks.It was this key into her psyche that cracked the case for the boss. Walt Disney understood what it was to love a father who was harsh to his children.""Dont you want to finish the story and let it go and move on with your life"" he asked.As a father himself Disney had promised his daughters to make a movie of the classic book. He persevered for 20 years.The film is a gentle meditation on the responsibilities of parenthood-- familial and creative. Disney and Travers were each disappointed by unavailable fathers. Both felt powerfully connected to their creative offspring. Disney compares his love for Mickey Mouse to Travers dedication to Poppins.According to her creator ""Mary Poppins is the very enemy of whimsy and sentiment.""Not so Saving Mr. Banks.Sentiment is at its heart. The legions who grew up on Disneys Mary Poppins will find it delightfully satisfying to hear snippets of its enormously catchy songs and watch its captivating creative journey. 99 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bzh1DeHoliday Movie Calendar DecemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this December complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

Francois Duhamel/Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Walt Disney Pictures Saving Mr. Banks chronicles Walt Disneys (Tom Hanks) long campaign to persuade Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to allow his movie-musical adaptation of her books. Francois Duhamel/Walt Disney Pictures Saving Mr. Banks Director John Lee Hancock Genre Drama Running Time 125 minutes Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including some unsettling images With Emma Thompson Tom Hanks Colin Farrell Paul Giamatti Jason Schwartzman ""We tell ourselves stories in order to live."" That endlessly quoted line from Joan Didions The White Album echoes with more than the usual resonance for the two adversaries duking it out for control over the movie adaptation of Mary Poppins in Saving Mr. Banks. For 20 years Walt Disney reportedly on his young daughters say-so had tried to wrestle a green light from P. L. Travers who wrote the original novels about the discipline-minded governess who flew in through a London window to save a troubled family from itself. In 1961 Travers flew from London to Los Angeles invited by Disney to work for two weeks with writer Don DaGradi and the Sherman Brothers on the script and the score. Uncle Walt was hoping for compliance but like Mary Poppins Travers was no pushover. In fact she was a stubborn argumentative piece of work. Travers wrote tough-minded literature; the Disney machine made uplifting entertainment. Not to disparage either but Travers Mary Poppins was no Julie Andrews. She was an implacable termagant armed with a much tougher brand of love than Disney was prepared for. Anyone who really knew the character or the author might have predicted that this effort to mix oil and water would end in tears. Saving Mr. Banks does end in tears but theyre Disney tears as befits a movie about Disney made by Disney. Which doesnt mean you shouldnt see this beguiling piece of pop storytelling built on half-truths whipped into shape for a storybook ending that never was. i Travers braves the streets of Los Angeles with her driver Ralph (Paul Giamatti) after Disney invites her to collaborate on the film. Francois Duhamel/Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Walt Disney Pictures Travers braves the streets of Los Angeles with her driver Ralph (Paul Giamatti) after Disney invites her to collaborate on the film. Francois Duhamel/Walt Disney Pictures Thats pretty much what youd expect from the humane if expertly commercial hand of John Lee Hancock who did the same for the fact-based The Blind Side in which come to think about it Sandra Bullock was her own kind of Poppins a bossyboots savior throwing her weight around for the greater good. Like the Mary Poppins film Disney would eventually serve up Saving Mr. Banks is an affable enjoyable spoonful of sugar that sweetens into palatability the sinus-clearing bite of the books -- and the implacable iron lady who wrote them. To have a dragon like Mary Poppins on your side was a big thrill for us kids growing up in post-Depression postwar England. She may have been the T. rex of British nannies but she was a protector and a believer in kids ability to look out for themselves. There was more than a little of both in Travers whos played in the movie by Emma Thompson a vision in pursed lips hair permed within an inch of its life and the clipped syllables of a rigid defender of the queens English. Queen Victoria most likely. Revered and lusted after this side of the Atlantic as the blooming rose of Howards End Sense and Sensibility and Love Actually Thompson has far more kick to her when she mines the rich vein of fearsome British educators like her warty Nanny McPhee or the quietly anti-Semitic headmistress in An Education -- a gorgon so like my own girls-school principal that I left the theater shaking. Yet Thompsons schoolmarms always carry a barely suppressed undertow of fragility. So too her spinsterish Pamela Travers a famous but cash-strapped author whos a pill-popping neurotic beneath her cool poise. This Travers curls her lip at the giant Mickey Mouse placed in her hotel room by way of welcome only to cry herself to sleep later clutching him to her neglected bosom. Never mind that in real life Travers had a lively romantic history with both men and women and raised an adopted son alone. She was anything but the prim lonely virgin forever on the brink of hysteria that the movie makes her out to be. By every account she was no picnic either -- so by way of sympathetic explanation Hancock and screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith supply her with a plausible if awkwardly wedged-in back story. In flashbacks to her itinerant childhood in Australia we learn that Mrs. Travers is neither Mrs. nor Travers nor British by birth; she papered over a host of childhood sorrows with a self-invented construct. As a child she was Helen Goff a willing captive to her charming feckless father (Colin Farrell to the manner born) a failed bank manager and raging alcoholic who corralled his daughter into becoming his enabler and co-dreamer. The movie draws neat and possibly accurate parallels between Travers characters and the real-life people who helped and hurt the author as a little girl -- among them a practical Aunt Ellie played by the great Rachel Griffiths who brings forth potted plants from a carpetbag and ... well you know. Walt Disney played by an avuncular subtly conniving Tom Hanks in slicked-down hair and a toothbrush mustache gets his own Bad Dad back story too. But Disney has reinvented himself as the ultimate upbeat American and he wants this glum Brit to toe the line. Hed ultimately like her to be happy -- Disney wanted everyone happy or else -- but hes also a wily businessman who exploits his own sad tale to get Travers to sign on for creative changes she hated. (Among them that giddy suffragette mother and Dick van Dyke in the role of Bert the chimney sweep. Lets not talk about the dancing penguins which filled Travers with more bile than she could stomach.) Interviewed recently in The New York Times the surviving Sherman brother didnt remember his encounter with the holy terror very fondly. There are tapes of their sessions to back him up yet the movies funniest and sweetest scenes play out in the culture clash between Travers and the brothers played by B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman. Here as elsewhere -- I could have done without Travers relentlessly sunny driver played of all people by Paul Giamatti -- Hancock packs on the schmaltz. So far as I can tell though theres only one genuine potential whopper in Saving Mr. Banks. It comes right at the end when Travers breaks down in tears at the glitzy Hollywood premiere to which she had to invite herself because Walt Disney feared that she might make a scene. In the movie shes crying with relief at having her awful childhood symbolically turned into uplift. The historical record here is ambiguous though by many accounts Travers actually went to pieces because she loathed the way Disney had bowdlerized her work. Certainly she gave no more permissions until 1994 when Cameron Mackintosh came cap in hand for his Broadway musical adaptation. Were he alive today Walt Disney would have kvelled over the ending of Saving Mr. Banks. For her part Travers would have rolled her eyes or maybe filed suit. In one sense Disney won -- but do stay for the credits which come with a mischievous but I like to think loving tribute to the obstinate battle-ax who made his life miserable and his blockbuster movie possible.

"Saving Mr. Banks gets goofy about Mary Poppins review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSaving Mr. Banks gets goofy about Mary Poppins review Saving Mr. Banks starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson is the chim-chiminey-cheery account of how Walt Disney finagled the movie rights to Mary Poppins. Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as author P.L. Travers in a scene from Saving Mr. Banks.  (Francois Duhamel / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 12 2013Saving Mr. BanksStarring Tom Hanks Emma Thompson Colin Farrell Paul Giamatti Ruth Wilson Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak. 125 minutes. Directed by John Lee Hancock. Opens Dec. 13 at Varsity Cinemas. PGEarly in Saving Mr. Banks the chim-chiminey-cheery account of how Walt Disney finagled Mary Poppins from a mightily peeved author a certain star rodent almost kills the deal.P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) is appalled to find her Beverly Hilton hotel suite chock full of Disney souvenirs including a large Mickey Mouse doll. The Poppins scribe turns Mickey to the wall with the admonition ""You can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety.""Article Continued BelowThe command goes largely unheeded in the movie efficiently directed by John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) where blandness gets confused with nuance and melodrama threatens by way of flashback. We shouldnt be surprised. This isnt just a movie by Disney a studio where subtlety is rarer than a Goofy frown. Its a film largely about revered founder Walt played by Tom Hanks and the legend must be protected.When the story sticks to the 1961 mouse-and-cat game between Disney and Travers the tale being sold in the trailer and TV ads well its a jolly holiday with Mary. The smile curdles through frequent and tiresome strolls down the rocky memory lane of Travers impoverished Australian childhood. She grew up with a beloved but alcoholic father played by Colin Farrell and the constant flashbacks make for a whole other movie a drearier one.In the film we really want to see a mustachioed Hanks makes for a convincing Disney. He conjures up with a grin and wink Uncle Walts indefatigable optimism eternal boyishness and consummate salesmanship. Disney has been trying for 20 years to convince Travers to give him the movie rights to Mary Poppins and with her resolve evidently weakening (she needs the money) hes eager to close the deal -- even if she isnt.Thompson is equally grand as Travers although the screenplay by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith does the author few favours depicting her as the worst combination of snob bully and nitpicker. (To be fair the historical record including an audiotape of her played under the closing credits does suggest that Travers wasnt a whole lot of fun.)This creator of childrens stories apparently hates kids too. She caustically asks the mother of a cherubic infant seated near her on the London to L.A. flight ""will the child be a nuisance?""Travers disagreeable nature is only partially explained by her expressed concern that Disney will turn her whip-smart Mary Poppins into an animated simpleton ""careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze.""Her real fear is dishonouring the memory of her father who is the basis for the George Banks of the story the redeemable bank tycoon and household tyrant. Disney has his own family debt to honour he promised his young daughters that hell make a movie out of their favourite fictional nanny.Thats about as deep as Saving Mr. Banks goes even if it promises to tell us the ""untold story"" of how Mary Poppins was made.Theres no explanation for the Buddha statue and numerous bottles of pills that Travers unpacks in her hotel room (she apparently had interesting religious and health views). Disneys chain-smoking habit is a no-no for this picture which also skates around those dancing cartoon penguins in Mary Poppins -- Disney had promised Travers there would be no animation.We do get a feel for working inside the Disney laugh factory done up here in Mad Men style and colours especially in the scenes where house tunesmiths Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) engage in passive-aggressive wordplay war with Travers. How do you explain ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" to a woman who insists on always using the Queens English?Travers should have a greater problem with the anachronistic ""no problem-o"" uttered by Paul Giamattis limo-driving Ralph since its an expression thats more Bart Simpson than Mickey Mouse. The permanently chipper Ralph is more cartoon character than human though so at least they got that bit right.But let us not split hairs even if Travers would. Saving Mr. Banks is hard to beat as holiday entertainment. Endure the dull melodrama and give thanks that the sugar in the rest of the film is doled out by the spoonful not the shovelful.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By Peter Travers December 12 2013 More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> Dont gag. But this movie about how Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) finally persuaded P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to let him make a movie of her Mary Poppins books is a tasty swig of holiday cheer. Ms. Travers (Pamela to a select few) was a piece of work. And Thompson is a spit-spot pleasure in the role sharp-tongued and deadpan-hilarious. Mary Poppins the flying nanny to the very British Banks family could be stern. But for sass Pamela has it all over her creation played by an Oscar-winning Julie Andrews in the beloved 1964 film. Thompsons scenes with Hanks splendid at showing the conniving side of a goody-goody icon are irresistible fun. Meeting Disney on the studio lot in Burbank in 1961 she tells him she hates his silly cartoons abhors musicals and wants to return home to England and deny him film rights. More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> Pamela proves instantly allergic to California telling her driver (Paul Giamatti wonderful) ""It smells like chlorine and sweat."" She reacts badly to the Poppins script co-written by Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and worse to the less than supercalifragilisticexpialidocious songs of the Sherman brothers played with perfect comic pitch by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak. Does Ms. Travers have a heart? The script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith uses flashback to show she does. Pamela born Helen Goff is an Aussie girl (Annie Rose Buckley) raised on the rough outback by an adored workaholic father (an outstanding Colin Farrell) who fuels his doomed dreams with drink. In the Poppins books its the father Mr. Banks whom nanny Mary comes to save not the children. Director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) does his best to mesh past and present without rank tear-jerking. He doesnt always succeed. But Thompson and Hanks both worthy of Oscar nods certainly do. Thanks to them this movie about the making of a movie hits the sweet spot. Theres magic in it. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

(Francois Duhamel) By Ann Hornaday December 12 2013 Follow AnnHornaday A spoonful of sugar and all the cheap sentiment and facile whimsy it represents are precisely what author P.L. Travers abhors in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" a richly rendered engrossing dramatization of Walt Disneys efforts to adapt Traverss novel ""Mary Poppins"" into one of his confectionery extravaganzas. Played by Emma Thompson in a deliciously brittle turn Travers emerges in the film as a humorless imperious unfailingly prim martinet who when she arrives at the Disney studios in 1961 to collaborate on the script insists that everyone -- even Uncle Walt -- address her as ""Mrs. Travers."" Reluctant to hand over Mary Poppins -- never just ""Mary"" please -- Travers wages a two-week war of attrition on the screenwriter and composers assigned to bring the magical governess to the screen wearing the boys down with constant criticisms and suggestions all to keep her most cherished creation from becoming yet another casualty of Disney-fication ""cavorting twinkling . . . careening toward a happy ending like a kamikaze."" Thompson her perfectly powdered face topped with a crown of angry curls her mouth carefully drawn into a disapproving crimson grimace tucks into such succulent dialogue with relish dousing every line with an extra drop of vinegar for acidic good measure. The irresistible force to her unmovable object is Tom Hanks whose Walt Disney is all soft-spoken Midwestern manipulation unctuous and shrewd in equal parts. Unimpressed by the balloons and Mickey Mouse plush toys that greet her at the Beverly Hills Hotel ""positively sickened"" by the prospect of visiting Disneyland bored by California (Los Angeles smells of ""chlorine and sweat"" she announces upon her arrival at the airport) Travers is impervious to Disneys cajoling and flattery. To paraphrase a flinty sister-under-the-skin albeit from another era the ladys not for turning -- on one of Disneys carousels or otherwise. Even with Thompsons delectably dyspeptic portrayal of Travers shed be a difficult protagonist to root for were it not for the back story of ""Mary Poppins"" that ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is really about. What comes to light in the flashbacks that constitute their own period-piece-within-a-period-piece is that Poppins was a product of Traverss own childhood in Australia where she grew up as Helen Goff at the turn of the century the favorite daughter of an alcoholic bank manager named Travers Goff (played in a sad-eyed sympathetic turn by Colin Farrell). Compulsively toggling back and forth between 1960s L.A. and a Goff family farmhouse mired in addiction and financial worries ""Saving Mr. Banks"" doesnt always straddle its stories and time periods with the utmost grace. But the film -- which John Lee Hancock directed from a script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith -- more than makes up for its occasionally unwieldy structure in telling a fascinating and ultimately deeply affecting story along the way giving viewers tantalizing glimpses of the beloved 1964 movie musical in both its creation and final form. In addition to the evocative scenes of Traverss simultaneously idyllic and horrifying childhood the best moments of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" occur in the Disney rehearsal room where screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman) endure Traverss constant stream of invective. When the Shermans try out a little ditty for Dick Van Dyke that rhymes ""constable"" with ""responstable"" she immediately notes that ""responstable"" is not a word. ""We made it up"" they tell her. ""Well un-make it up"" she snaps. (Its revealing that the person Travers is kindest to a chauffeur played by Paul Giamatti is the films only fictional character.) How on earth could this marriage be saved? In ""Saving Mr. Banks"" its Disney himself who comes to the rescue when the genial mustached Hanks delivers a moving if cloyingly self- righteous speech about the role of storytelling (read Hollywood) in healing primal wounds. Its a self-serving moment easily dismissed as studio-sanctioned mythmaking. Still thanks to the particular story it tells and the marvelous actors channeling it ""Saving Mr. Banks"" succeeds in proving Disneys point. Catharsis is powerful medicine whether its delivered by way of a mouse with big ears a sharp-elbowed woman allowing bitterness to melt into long-buried grief or that dreaded delightful spoonful of sugar.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Saving Mr. Banks Share Comment ""Saving Mr. Banks"" may be the most entertaining two hours of corporate branding youll ever see. The film tells the story of ""Mary Poppins"" from the other side of the screen in the battle of wills between the lady who wrote the book -- the veddy British P.L. Travers played (delightfully) by Emma Thompson -- and the all-American pop visionary who made the movie Walt Disney (Tom Hanks enjoyable but miscast). ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is extremely canny and often great fun primarily in the scenes in which Travers locks horns with the Disney-ites. When all is said and done though its a drama about the joys of selling out and because the movies a Disney production theres little irony intended. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

(Francois Duhamel) B+ Saving Mr. Banks Genre Drama; Starring Colin Farrell Tom Hanks Emma Thompson; Director John Lee Hancock; Release Date Wide 12/20/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 120; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted January 7 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Theres something a little incestuous about a studio making a movie about one of its greatest box office triumphs. But Disneys backstage drama about how its whimsical 1964 kids classic Mary Poppins came to be is a delight. Have they sanded off some of Mouse House maestro Walt Disneys rougher edges and added a spoonful or two of sugar to help the medicine go down? Sure. But John Lee Hancocks film is a soul-stirring treat. Much of the credit has to go to Emma Thompson who plays Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers -- a humorless British battle-ax who keeps resisting Disneys siren call (and open checkbook) to sell the rights to her creation. Just the thought of Hollywood getting its trivializing mitts on her beloved character is enough to send Travers into scowling fits of apoplexy -- and Thompson gives a master class on playing the snippy sour lemon. It isnt just that Travers thinks so little of the movies. Its that her fictional umbrella-wielding governess means so much to her personally (we find out why through too-frequent flashbacks to her sad upbringing in rural Australia). Needing cash she heads to Los Angeles which she dismisses as smelling of ""chlorine and sweat."" There she comes face-to-face with Uncle Walt himself (Tom Hanks) a sunny born salesman peddling can-do optimism and Tinseltown fairy dust -- a cocktail shes constitutionally immune to which is saying something considering Hanks twinkly-eyed charisma. Travers bullies the films writer (Bradley Whitford) and the duo of composer brothers (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman). For her the Dream Factory is nothing short of a nightmare. Of course we all know how the story ends -- Julie Andrews performance is too etched into our collective childhood not to. But the trick here is how perfectly Thompson and Hanks portray the gradual thaw in their characters frosty alliance empathizing with each others equally miserable upbringings in a beautiful three-hankie scene late in the film. Saving Mr. Banks is a wholesomely square film about a wholesomely square film. But damned if its sugar doesnt go down like honey.

""Saving Mr. Banks"" starring Emma Thompson as the brittle Travers and Tom Hanks as a shrewd Disney throws a delightful glass of ice water onto the heartwarming 1964 classic ""Mary Poppins."" This being a Disney movie about a Disney movie you can expect your cockles to fire up again by the end. But the fun of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" lies in discovering that the woman who created the flying nanny immortalized by Julie Andrews on film was herself something closer to Cruella De Vil. Its a fascinating story in which Travers after stalling Walt for 20 years shows up in California to talk turkey. Shes rude to her chauffeur Ralph (an adorable Paul Giamatti) and appalled by songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) who keep churning out childish tripe like ""Chim Chim Cher-ee."" She wont allow animation (not even those penguins who dance around Dick Van Dyke) or for some reason the color red. ""You dont know what she means to me"" Travers tells Disney of her fictional creation. It turns out Travers is sitting on a childhood full of emotional pain much of it stemming from her alcoholic father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell). Through flashbacks ""Saving Mr. Banks"" tells this story as well connecting the psychological dots between the real father and the one that Poppins fans know as George Banks. It doesnt always work partly because director John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") forces the issue with superficial visual cues between past and present. 254 MoviesSaving Mr. Banks trailer What makes ""Saving Mr. Banks"" work is Thompson in a wonderful nuanced performance that walks a fine line between villain and heroine.

Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff ----- MOVIES ABOUT THE MAKING OF FAMOUS MOVIES ""Saving Mr. Banks"" about the rough road to get ""Mary Poppins"" to the screen is the latest film to prove that behind-the-scenes drama on the set can be as compelling as the actual film. Here are four other movies about the making of a famous movie. ED WOOD (1994) -- Tim Burtons biography of the cross-dressing director whose taste in movies was as bad as his taste in fashion really shines when re-creating scenes from ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" often cited as the worst film ever made. MoviesGolden Globe awards 2014 nominees RKO 281 (1999) -- Liev Schreiber played boy wonder Orson Welles in this account of the making of Welles masterpiece ""Citizen Kane"" and publisher William Randolph Hearsts campaign to destroy the thinly veiled screen version of his life. advertisement | advertise on newsday MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) -- Although much of this movie about the making of Marilyn Monroes 1957 comedy ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" focuses on her infatuation with a young film student the real sparks come from the tension between Monroe (Michelle Williams) and her director and co-star Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh).

Pico Blvd. Los Angeles; opens throughout Orange County at 7 p.m. Dec. 19 (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitDysfunctional family flashbacks gradually diminish this frisky depiction of the fight between private novelist P.L. Travers and extroverted entertainment god Walt Disney over his adaptation of her ""Mary Poppins."" Grade B Its enthralling fun to watch Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) focus his charm and instinct on flinty British novelist P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) as he campaigns to film her ""Mary Poppins."" But Disneys prime creation Mickey Mouse is the one who delivers the ultimate pop moment in ""Saving Mr. Banks."" Near the end lights cameras and hoopla disorient the ultra-private Travers during the gala premiere of ""Mary Poppins"" on August 27 1964. She looks too dizzy to enter Graumans Chinese Theatre. Precisely when she needs a friendly hand Mickey gallantly offers her his arm. Of course hes just a costumed greeter and Travers never changes her mind about hating Disneys cartoons. She even shields her eyes and moans at the penguins dancing with Dick Van Dyke. But for a moment she appreciates the never-say-die jollity of Mickey Mouse. A woman who considers herself an artist-intellectual and looks down on Disney as a peddler of gaudy sentimental kitsch she experiences the pleasure anyone can derive from this peppy can-do rodent. High culture and mass culture meet - and nearly everyone gets happy if not happy-ever-after. Why and how Travers book entered the Mouse House is the story of ""Saving Mr. Banks."" The director John Lee Hancock and his screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith swiftly set the stage for this agreeably theatrical movie. In 1961 sales had dried up for Travers books. After two decades of courting her Disney in addition to much-needed money offers her the unprecedented right of script approval. She agrees to confer in Burbank with the Disney Studios talented team - writer Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and the songwriting Sherman brothers Richard M. (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert B. (B.J. Novak). DaGradi and the Shermans produce sparkly ideas and Travers promptly douses them. Travers unpredictability brings this wet-blanket farce a rare crackle. Some of her notions are innocuous - for example she thinks ""Winifred"" is a warmer name for a mother than ""Cynthia."" Some are idiosyncratic - she insists that Mary Poppins would use a rollout tape-measure as did her own mother. And some are simply absurd - she banishes the color red. She becomes a comic mystery that even Walt Disney cant solve. Why is she so harsh and resistant to change? How do you solve a problem like P.L. Travers? Along with the suspense theres sacrifice and risk. The Shermans toiled on the score and adaptation for years - they didnt know Disney had not tied up the story rights. Schwartzman whirs with a canny kids vitality as Richard M. He generally defers to Travers. But Novaks s comical and stirring Robert B. spurs her anger. This wounded World War II vet who walks with a cane wont hold his tongue to please some haughty scribbler. Thompson savors Travers sharp edges yet the writer can also feel nicked by them herself. Gradually she lowers her guard with her studio-appointed driver (Paul Giamatti). Who wouldnt? The great Giamatti fleshes out a sentimental sunny salt-of-the-earth role; he gives the character a core of self-knowledge that evokes an honest response from Travers. With Disney shes wary and combative - and thats also understandable. Hanks Disney is simultaneously shrewd visionary ruthless and empathetic - especially when he tells Travers that he figured her out because he had a troubled childhood too. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is full of spunk whenever it bears down on their conflicting temperaments. Thompson bows new variations on being high-strung and Hanks reveals the savvy and energy beneath a beloved show-biz deity. But the movie nearly capsizes under the melodramatic weight of recurring flashbacks to Travers volatile youth. She grows up as Helen Goff the favorite daughter of Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) the alcoholic manager of a backwater Australian bank. Hes a charmer who can also be a mean drunk and a bumbler. But he loves entertaining Helen with wild farcical stories and he considers her a Celtic mystic like himself. To them he says the world is an illusion. The movie insists that Travers clings to her characters as literal representations of her actual family. Mary Poppins is her mothers Aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths) who restores order to the household. Mr. Banks is the banker father she cant save from ruin and an early death. Shes determined not to let Disneys script depict him as a cruel parent. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" parallels Dennis Potters superb screenplay for ""Dreamchild"" (1985) in which Lewis Carrolls Alice nearly 80 keeps remembering her childhood while preparing to speak at a Carroll centenary in Manhattan. That movie also dramatizes a grown woman grappling with distressing distant memories as she tours a modern magic kingdom. But ""Dreamchild"" smartly interweaves the flashbacks with Jim Hensons stunning renderings of Carrolls fabulous creatures. The flashbacks in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" though beautifully photographed and acted lack that kind of imaginative zest. They weigh the movie down. Still this film would be worth seeing just to hear Hanks Disney unsentimentally proclaim that his first priority is ""to protect the picture."" And many scenes are both blissfully funny and emotionally complete. After DaGradi and the Shermans grasp Travers one seminal point - Mary Poppins comes to save Mr. Banks not his children - they unveil his grand redemption he leads the exuberant anthemic number ""Lets Go Fly a Kite."" Then Travers starts capering around the rehearsal room with the writers as everybody sings along. Its as satisfying as Anna and the King of Siam asking ""Shall We Dance?"" in ""The King and I."" You wish shed spin around the floor with Disney too. Luckily Thompson and Hanks play out a spirited verbal pas de deux.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Saving Mr. Banks Video Rated PG-13  125 minutes  2013 P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) the persnickety British author of the Mary Poppins books travels to Hollywood in the early 60s to supervise their adaptation into a live-action feature produced by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks). Early rumors that this Walt Disney Pictures release would offer a glimpse of the real man--a selfish demanding and often unpleasant executive--turn out to be false unless you want to count the shot in which Disney can be seen putting down a cigarette. Hanks captures his affected innocence and oily charm though Thompson gives such a showy performance (""Pfft"" she exclaims periodically) that one expects her to open up an umbrella and float away. Screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith cross-cut laboriously between creative clashes on the Disney lot and Traverss childhood in Australia where she suffered the trauma of an alcoholic father (Colin Farrell); rest assured that by the end a little pixie dust will solve everything. John Lee Hancock directed; with Paul Giamatti Bradley Whitford and Jason Schwartzman quite funny as beleaguered songwriter Richard Sherman. By J.R.

Photo Franois Duhamel Walt Disney Pictures Saving Mr. Banks review Some will love it 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Saving Mr. Banks Drama. Starring Emma Thompson Tom Hanks and Colin Farrell. Directed by John Lee Hancock. (PG-13. 125 minutes.) ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a pleasant movie about the making of ""Mary Poppins"" filmed with grace and directed with care. It contains two outstanding performances by Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell and a performance by Tom Hanks as Walt Disney that is neither good nor bad but strange enough to be interesting. The film is too intelligent and well crafted to dismiss and too good to hate. Some people will love it and at worst most people will like it a little. And yet ... just something about it ... ""Saving Mr. Banks"" feels like a snow job. Maybe everything in it is true. Maybe Walt Disney really did have the patience of a saint. Maybe Pamela Travers (the author of ""Mary Poppins"") really did curl up in bed holding a stuffed Mickey Mouse. And maybe she really was deeply moved by the finished movie. I doubt it but no matter. If ""Saving Mr. Banks"" were 100 percent false and yet felt true that would be fine. But this has the self-conscious whiff if not of mendacity then of public relations. But then you cant really expect unbounded spontaneity when a studio makes a movie about its own founder and about its own movie - especially one about to have its 50th anniversary in 2014. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is set in two time periods the early 1960s lead-up to ""Mary Poppins"" with frequent flashbacks to Pamela Travers girlhood in the early 20th century. Early scenes In terms of story the 1960s scenes are much more entertaining - there is movement things happen - and yet the early scenes have an integrity about them. As directed by John Lee Hancock Colin Farrell doesnt necessarily play Travers father as he really was but rather the father that was recorded in a little girls memory as impossibly handsome unconditionally loving and tragically flawed. That bond between a father whos hopeless in the world and the little girl who worships him is the most poignant thing in the film. It goes a decent way toward ennobling the adult Travers who is not otherwise sympathetic but rather a brittle personality one under the constant misapprehension either that she is being attacked or that the world is in a conspiracy to annoy her. The casting of the naturally likable Emma Thompson softens this by making her seem vulnerable beneath the nastiness. But it does make one imagine that Travers was a piece of work. The frequent shifts back and forth through time constitute a clumsiness of the screenplay which Hancock and cinematographer John Schwartzman handle with panache. In one particularly lovely transition we see Travers as a child beautifully framed in the back door of a train. As the train moves away the camera lifts to catch the steam coming from the engine which dissolves into the sky of 1961. As the two story threads come together - that is as her past begins to affect what is happening in Travers present - the movie improves. It becomes less scattered. Yet even then the specific way in which the past exerts its influence feels a little too easy and neat. A key scene in which Disney talks to Travers in her London living room is presented as a tribute to his sensitivity forbearance and profound insight into the human heart. Indeed I suspect that its purely as a concession to realism that the movie doesnt depict Disney actually walking across the Atlantic to get there. Wig and mustache Which brings us to Tom Hanks who doesnt quite seem like Walt Disney but more like Tom Hanks in a wig and a mustache. His Midwestern accent goes in and out with a dash of John Huston here and some Lionel Barrymore there. Really there is no believing him for a second and yet like the movie stars of the classic era Hanks automatically gets some special exemption because theres no disbelieving him either. He just leaves us contentedly accepting that if Disney were a lot like Hanks hed have acted exactly like that. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Travers in ""Saving Mr. Banks."" (Francois Duhamel) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday December 12 2013 1200 PM Title Saving Mr. Banks Film Info With Emma Thompson Tom Hanks. ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers wants Walt Disney to go fly a kite. Director John Lee Hancock (206). PG-13. City Cinemas 123 Regal E-Walk. The slick but moving ""Saving Mr. Banks"" transcends its corporate pedigree to become a great Disney movie about making a Disney movie. A charming comedy-drama about the creation of the 1964 classic ""Mary Poppins"" this new release shows how creativity and pain can be a recipe for magic. Fairy tales we know are made of dark stuff under the spoonfuls of sugar. Not that P.L. Travers (an exquisite Emma Thompson) the author of the ""Poppins"" books ever wanted her work to be a movie at all. When we see her in the early 1960s shes resisted the overtures from mogul Walt Disney to make Poppins part of his Magic Kingdom. She finally relents due more to her financial hardship than the good-natured insistence of Disney (a great Tom Hanks). She flies from London to meet him and at his studio Mrs. Travers (as she insists on being called) fits in like a talking umbrella. She hates whimsy abhors animation and rejects the music of the Sherman brothers (Jason Schwartzman B.J. Novak). She has final say on the movie and is adamant ""Poppins"" have ""gravitas."" We learn why in flashback. In Australia in the early 20th century as a young girl she and her family had to constantly relocate because her beloved father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) let alcoholism destroy him. Whimsy was Goffs defense against his demons. It could not save him though or save his daughter from a tough childhood. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" though is rescued by Farrell and Hanks goes beyond mere imitation. The mustache and affability are right -- despite a forced Missouri twang -- and Hanks gets the essence of the man. When Kelly Marcels pearl-filled script has Disney gently reveal his own hurts and hopes the actors warmth is irresistible. P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson r.) doesnt seem too impressed with Disneyland or Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) in ""Saving Mr. Banks (Francois Duhamel) Thompson is a hoot and a half. Dressing down the Shermans or demanding that the color red not be in the film shes tart cranky and funny as hell. Mrs. Travers never really softens despite ""Poppins"" of course being made and released almost exactly 50 years ago. Director John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") adds a bit of cutesiness -- listen carefully for ""Heigh-ho heigh-ho"" as Mrs. Travers and her chauffeur (Paul Giamatti) cruise onto the lot -- but the sometimes flinty emotions are honest. Gorgeously shot and witty without being jokey ""Saving Mr. Banks"" saves itself from cookie-cutter emotion with just the right sprinkling of reality.

"Saving Mr. Banks movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Review Saving Mr. Banks Retelling of story behind Disneys Mary Poppins owes its zing to Emma Thompson as P.L. TraversDecember 12 2013|Michael PhillipsTom Hanks stars in ""Saving Mr. Banks."" (Franaois Duhamel/Disney)No feathers animated or otherwise will be ruffled by ""Saving Mr. Banks"" director John Lee Hancocks genial fictionalized account of how Walt Disney seduced ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers into allowing for 5 percent of the gross the supernatural caregiver to become a shiny Disney version of herself.Mainly the film is a testament to Emma Thompson. Shes swell as Travers the Australian-born resident of London who travels to Los Angeles in 1961 for a couple of contentious weeks in the pre-production life of the film released three years later.There are other fine actors on screen among them Tom Hanks as Disney and in a fabricated role of a limo driver and horn-rimmed sounding board Paul Giamatti. But Thompsons the show. Each withering put-down every jaundiced utterance lands with a little ping. Then she makes you cry by gum.If Thompson wins an Academy Award for ""Saving Mr. Banks"" well sometimes these Oscars go to elevator operators -- performers who lift routine material to a higher floor.Travers went into Disney negotiations for her stories film rights with certain rules in mind. No animation of any kind. An all-English cast. As little overt sentiment as possible. She had script approval and though the movie fudges this her own script treatment in development.But Disney won out. The songs in part won her over. Travers left LA with wildly mixed emotions but pleased with the financial prospects and ""Mary Poppins"" became a monster hit.With diagrammatic purpose ""Saving Mr. Banks"" breaks down its hard-shell protagonists exterior with a series of interlaced flashbacks revealing how and why young Georgia Goff became Pamela Travers. Saddled with a charming but alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) and a despondent suicidal mother (Ruth Wilson) the Goff girls living in the remote turn-of-the-century Australian outback were saved by the presence of their stern but loving aunt (Rachel Griffiths). This was the Poppins prototype the savior figure in the young Travers life.""Saving Mr. Banks"" turns Disney into a Chicago-born version of Sigmund Freud doggedly solving the riddle of his reluctant authors unhappiness to secure her legal approval to shoot ""Mary Poppins"" the Disney way.The writing scenes make for some rich high comedy. As Disney house songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak act as puppy dog foils. Screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith treat everyone gently and with the utmost respect.The sharper edges of the Disney/Travers relationship well-documented by various sources have been rounded off but the actors suggest what they can where they can. Travers personal life is not dealt with. Theres a single oblique reference to her own son. Some of this relates to streamlined storytelling; some of it I think has more to do with avoiding potential ruffled feathers. This is after all a Disney film in large part about Walt Disney to whom Hanks lends gravity sincerity and high true motivations for getting at Travers secrets.Director Hancock knows a few things about directing crowd-pleasing heartwarmers having made ""The Blind Side."" This one wouldnt work without Thompson. Happily she and Julie Andrews have something in common as performers a sparkle and a wizardly combination of wiles and ease.mjphillipstribune.com""Saving Mr. Banks"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic elements including some unsettling images)Running time 205Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesWATCH the First Trailer for Disneys Saving Mr. BanksJuly 11 2013Valerie Lawson talks Mary Poppins She Wrote and P.L...December 20 2013Saving Mr. Banks opens AFI Fest with a spoonful of Oscar...November 8 2013With Mary Poppins theres more to know under the umbrellaDecember 20 2013Disney film to show how ""Mary Poppins"" flew from book to...September 19 2012Find More Stories AboutMary PoppinsJohn Lee HancockTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-saving-mr-banks-1213-20131212,0,6476487.column",200,savingmr.banks32,savingmr.banks,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet This Christmas Disney buys itself the gift of historical revisionism with Saving Mr. Banks an extremely rose-colored portrait of the relationship between Walt Disney and British novelist P.L. Travers. As the story goes Disney spent more than 20 years hounding Travers for the rights to her most famous character the magical nanny Mary Poppins. He finally succeeded in 1961 but with the condition that Travers who was fiercely protective of her intellectual property got final script approval. The author rather notoriously made life difficult for the filmmakers objecting to everything from the casting of Dick Van Dyke to the inclusion of cartoon penguins to the very idea of her novel being turned into a musical. Eventually however she relented--by most accounts because she needed the money--and Disney went forward with his sentimentalized version of Mary Poppins. The irony of Saving Mr. Banks is that it takes this true story of Hollywood conflict of artistic integrity pitted against studio moxie and gives it the same warm-and-fuzzy treatment the company gave Poppins. One womans failed battle to stop her work from being Disneyfied has itself been Disneyfied.When it comes to vigilantly protecting an icon Travers has nothing on the gatekeepers at the Mouse House. In whats being sold as the first depiction of Walt Disney in a mainstream movie Tom Hanks turns up the benevolence--the twinkle-in-his-eye charm the bemused good humor--to portray the world-famous animation mogul. He finds a classic foil in Travers the infamously unyielding writer whom Emma Thompson plays as an incorrigible curmudgeon. Flown to Los Angeles to provide input on the preproduction of Disneys Mary Poppins movie she becomes an immediate thorn in the side of screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and the songwriting Sherman brothers Robert (B.J. Novak) and Richard (Jason Schwartzman). At its best Saving Mr. Banks is in that writers room mining differences of opinion for combative comedy; Novak especially has the Office-honed chops to make impatience funny. Its a pity then that Travers seems to suffer from a chronic case of the flashbacks Dramatizing her memories the film frequently leaps back in time to turn-of-the-century Australia where the author as a young girl watches hopelessly while her doting idealistic father (Colin Farrell terrific in a thankless role) succumbs to alcoholism. These little-house-on-the-Outback passages are meant to illustrate the personal parallels between the Travers life and work with Poppins patriarch Mr. Banks a clear stand-in for the actual father she lost. (He supposedly dropped dead when she was 7.) In truth they make the film feel like involuntary channel surfing--the equivalent of switching between a frothy showbiz comedy and a maudlin kitchen-sink drama. Why was Travers so adamant so stubbornly uncompromising about the adaptation of her work? To hear Saving Mr. Banks tell it there was a simple psychological rationale for her reluctance. (Short answer She had daddy issues.) That angle feels not just overly simplistic but also convenient Were the film to merely accept Travers distrust of Disney at face value it might risk suggesting she was right to worry about what this corporate giant would do with her beloved characters. So no shes just got a problem and its nothing that cant be fixed by a guided tour of Disneyland regular chats with a kindly chauffeur (Paul Giamatti rarely this upbeat) and a climactic Tom Hanks monologue thats about 25 percent honest emotion 75 percent emotional manipulation. Depicting its hesitant heroine as a kind of Scrooge figure whose cranky principled stance can only be conquered by the magic of Disney Saving Mr. Banks plays like a celebration of selling out. Naturally the film neglects to note how much Travers actually hated the finished Mary Poppins movie. Shed probably have hated this one too.

Travers Saving Mr. Banks tom hanks Walt Disney Entertainment News Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" (Credit Walt Disney Pictures) The great worm wrapped around the world eats his own tail and here we are Walt Disney himself becomes the protagonist -- the ever so mildly ironized protagonist to be sure -- of a Disney film which like all Disney films argues for an idealized marriage between art and showmanship for the sentimental unity of childhood and adulthood and for the healing of psychological trauma through mass-produced pleasure. Theres something to be said for those arguments if were honest and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" which stars Tom Hanks as a bluff and cheerful Walt Disney and the marvelous Emma Thompson as Pamela Travers author of the Mary Poppins books is a sneakily effective work of manipulation that should charm family audiences through the holiday season and beyond.As for the movies portrayal of the awkward prickly and sometimes antagonistic relationship between Disney and Travers which produced the 1964 hit musical ""Mary Poppins"" (which has just been released not coincidentally in a 50th-anniversary home-video package) its a weave of truthfulness mendacity cynicism and supposedly good intentions worthy of Walt himself. It bears about the same relationship to what actually happened as Julie Andrews sunny can-can-dancing family-healing and profoundly conformist Mary Poppins bears to the mysterious acrid sorceress of Travers books. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" which was directed by John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") from a script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith is a story about art and showmanship told entirely from the showmans point of view and thats certainly not surprising. Beyond that it eagerly assumes that the entire audience shares its Hollywood-totalitarian worldview and that we all understand that for the greater good of humanity this eccentric English lady with her precious little books needs to be steamrollered into surrendering her creation so it can be reshaped as a cracker-box message of family redemption complete with dancing penguins and Dick Van Dyke doing the worst accent work in the history of show business.Im not trying to convince you that the Disney ""Mary Poppins"" is a bad movie or that Travers was right with her high-handed creative-class bigotry about Disney cheapening and vulgarizing everything he touched. OK she was a little bit right but also she was wrong. The Julie Andrews ""Mary Poppins"" is a tremendous popular entertainment made and delivered by one of the worlds greatest showmen at the peak of his power and influence; my kids and very likely yours continue to enjoy it 50 years later. It captures bits of the Travers spirit here and there; it made her rich and it brought her millions of new readers. If Travers disliked its songs its sets its colors its general un-Englishness and the way it turned Mary Poppins into a ""hoyden"" and a ""soubrette"" (her words) she nonetheless cashed the checks. She famously cried during the Hollywood premiere (to which Disney had initially not invited her) and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" has the brass to portray those tears as joy or fulfillment or psychic liberation an interpretation that falls somewhere between artistic license and absolute horseshit.No words in any screenplay are worth less than the ones at the beginning that say ""based on a true story"" -- I mean isnt everything at some remove? -- but in general terms we can say that the outline of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is accurate. By the spring of 1961 when Disney flew Travers to Los Angeles to spend a week harassing and haranguing the storyboard artist and songwriters who were developing ideas for ""Mary Poppins"" he had spent more than 15 years pursuing the movie rights to her books which hed learned about from his young daughter Diane during World War II. He might never have gotten his way if Travers books had kept on selling but by the early 60s she was seen as a publishing has-been and badly needed money. The two had already had a face-to-face meeting in London sometime in the 50s (whereas in the movie they appear to be meeting for the first time) and she later described his manner as that of a man ""dangling a watch hypnotically before the eyes of a child."" But one may well ask who hypnotized whom because Disney would end up offering Travers an exceptionally generous deal quite unlike what he paid other authors She got 100000 (at least three-quarters of a million in todays dollars) 5 percent of the movies gross earnings and remarkably the right of script approval (although not she would learn later the right to final-cut approval of the film).Its also true as depicted in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" that Travers was ensconced at the Beverly Hills Hotel -- which prided itself then as now on delivering a proper English tea service -- and was taken to Disneyland and offered a tour of the companys state-of-the-art studios in Burbank neither of which interested her. These contrasts are a source of much of the comedy in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" in which Thompson plays Travers as a curt ill-tempered and exceptionally proper English lady a fish out of water in the promiscuous California sunshine and the informal corporate culture of Disney (where everyone from the janitors on up addressed the boss as Walt). You Might Also Like But as soon as we leave the general outline behind and get down to specifics ""Saving Mr. Banks"" stops bearing any resemblance to a true story and starts being a Disney movie a culture-clash comedy almost a platonic rom-com in which the uptight English chick has to learn important life lessons from her manly but relaxed American sweetheart deal with the unresolved trauma of her past pull the stick out of her ass and learn to live a little. (An important assist is delivered by Paul Giamatti playing Travers simple-minded chauffeur imbued with life wisdom. At least they didnt give the part to a black person.)Thompson is always a delight in any role and shes very funny playing Travers as a bastion of buttoned-down pride who uses the facade of propriety to conceal the fact that shes immensely arrogant and inconsiderate of others. ""Oh dear"" she says with a concerned look to a young mother while boarding the plane at Gatwick. ""Do you think the child will be a nuisance? Its an 11-hour flight"" Mary Poppins she informs Walt ""does not cavort Mr. Disney. She does not twinkle."" But this depiction of Travers as a tweedy upper-crust Englishwoman who finds all Americans to be uncouth barbarians is entirely a screenwriters archetype or stereotype and has almost nothing to do with the actual person.Pamela Travers whose birth name was Helen Goff had grown up in rural Australia -- a fact she never concealed though it comes in the movie as a big reveal -- had known William Butler Yeats in Ireland and had a long borderline-romantic friendship with the poet A.E. (aka George Russell) had lived for several years in New York and for two summers among the Hopi and Navajo people of the American Southwest had studied Zen Buddhism in Japan and had apparently had several long-term intimate relationships with other women. She was hardly the cloistered dame seen in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" and was a far more worldly person than Walt Disney.In ""Saving Mr. Banks"" the story of Pamela/Helens Australian childhood and her relationship with the father who drank himself to death when she was a child (played by Colin Farrell in a series of sentimental flashbacks) is presented as the secret key to the creation of Mary Poppins and to Travers eventual truce with Disney. The Zen study the Irish poetry the Manhattan apartment and the lesbian partnerships never come up because those dont belong in a Disney movie nor do we learn that Travers was more likely to wear Navajo skirts and Native American silver jewelry than a tweed twin-set. Instead we get a cheerfully insidious sitcom-style plot in which the sunny optimism of Disney writer and artist Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and songsmiths Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak respectively) gradually wear down the dreary tea-guzzlers resistance and she ends up singing along with ""Lets Go Fly a Kite"" after insisting that the proper English phrasing would be ""Lets Go and Fly a Kite."" My co-worker Dan DAddario recently suggested that ""Saving Mr. Banks"" should probably be considered a leading candidate in the Oscar race since its another self-congratulatory movie about moviemaking in the mold of ""Argo"" and ""The Artist"" and because it exudes that ineffable odor of well-crafted middle-middle movieness that makes academy voters go weak in the knees. Hes probably right. Dont get me wrong Its a highly enjoyable picture and please feel free to go see it with your relatives and write me a letter telling me what a small-minded cuss I am for observing that what it presents as a heartwarming true story of conflict and redemption is actually a propaganda fable celebrating the total victory of Hollywood the Disney-devouring of everything.Its one thing to argue that Disney was right and Travers wrong or that their oil-and-water commerce-and-art chemistry ultimately produced a terrific movie that bears a distant relationship to a terrific book. But the scene in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" that sums it all up which is no doubt meant to be jocular but struck me as terrifying comes when Thompsons Travers gets into bed in her overdecorated room at the Beverly Hills Hotel with a gigantic stuffed Mickey Mouse. Its not enough that Walt Disney turned Mary Poppins into a Disney character; that worked out OK for everyone. Now from beyond the grave his cold dead hand has reached out and turned Mary Poppins ferocious and unquenchable creator into Mickeys bitch.""Saving Mr. Banks"" opens this week in major cities with national release to follow beginning Dec. 20.

Travers (Emma Thompson) in Saving Mr. BanksPHOTO BY FRANCOIS DUHAMEL How stubborn was Walt Disney? He spent 26 years wheedling Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers to sell him the film rights to her book -- call it determination or bullying. Travers thought he was a hack who would louse up her story with cartoon penguins. Walt thought she was a pest. And half a century after his magic-nanny movie scored 13 Oscar nominations his studio has polished up his heroic quest like a bronze of Alexander the Great liberating Egypt. Suck on that spoonful old lady. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Saving Mr. Banks a fictionalized account of two weeks Travers spent on the lot in Burbank is proof that Walt has thawed and secretly reclaimed Disneys reins. Not only is he awarding his feat a second round of applause to play himself hes cast no less than Tom Hanks Americas dad a man who still looks huggable doused in Somalian pirate blood. Hanks Walt has a soft belly a hard head and the twang of a boy raised on a Missouri farm. Instead of out-arguing Travers qualms he simply smothers them in sugar. Watching the two go head-to-head is like watching a melted marshmallow drape itself over a spike. (Though if you look closely Hanks eyes flicker with a steely glint.)Against a charmer like that Emma Thompsons tweedy Travers doesnt stand a chance not that director John Lee Hancock gives her one. Audiences who love Walt Disneys Mary Poppins are forced to dislike its author who loathes everything about it the musical ditties Dick Van Dyke even Mr. Banks mustache. Thats not all she hates. Travers despises children California stuffed animals Jell-O and fun. Cookies are vulgar. Disneyland she sniffs is sickening.Film Details Saving Mr. Banks RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time120 min. More Info Trailer Thompson is good in a punishing role. In her first scene she stares down the camera as if its a dog who might nip her heels. She keeps her neck tight her mouth pinched and her nose aloft as though shes sniffing for trouble. When she clicks into the room in her sensible pumps screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and bouncy songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) shiver. Her Travers is as unpleasant as a pine needle pillow and shes as far away from the actual woman as ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" is from being a real word.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm In reality Travers was a feisty stereotype-breaking bisexual -- a single mom who adopted a baby in her 40s studied Zen meditation in Kyoto and was publishing erotica about her silky underwear 10 years before Walt had sketched his mouse. Now thats a character worth slapping on-screen instead of this stiff British stereotype determined to steal joy from future generations of children. With her longtime girlfriend and then-adult son erased this frigid Travers seems like she may not even know how babies are made. Maybe Mary Poppins could sing her a song about it.Why does it matter that Saving Mr. Banks sabotages its supposed heroine? Because in a Hollywood where men still pen 85 percent of all films theres something sour in a movie that roots against a woman who asserted her artistic control by asking to be a co-screenwriter. (Another battle she lost -- Mary Poppins opening credits list Travers as merely a ""consultant."") Just as slimy is the sense that this film made by a studio conglomerate in a Hollywood dominated by studio conglomerates is tricking us into cheering for the corporation over the creator. We take sides because we cant imagine living in a world without the songs the Sherman brothers wrote for the film ""Lets Go Fly a Kite"" ""Feed the Birds"" ""Chim Chim Cher-ee."" We wouldnt have had to either way; if Mary Poppins had collapsed Walt planned to package up the songs wholesale for Bedknobs and Broomsticks.As a feint toward empathy Saving Mr. Banks splices in Travers hardscrabble childhood in Australia. Her father (a charismatic Colin Farrell) was a yarn-spinning drunk her mum (Ruth Wilson) a wispy depressive. In them we see traces of what will become both her inspiration and irritants disorder whimsy and an instant suspicion of imps like Walt.Her history is true enough but its also the kind of missing-puzzle-piece pat psychology Travers would have loathed -- not to mention a fictionalized excuse for Hanks Walt to play Dr. Phil and solve her kiddie traumas. The real Walt didnt bother -- he deliberately decamped to Palm Springs as soon as her plane touched down. Neither Walt invited her to Mary Poppins premiere. So she invited herself a 65-year-old crasher at a party that should have been in her honor.Walt was popsicled two years later. Travers lasted another three decades. But while Saving Mr. Banks feels like his risen-from-the-grave attempt to pretend that Travers only cried during the film because it reminded her of her daddy the disgruntled writer got her own eternal revenge on Walt Burbank and the sunny country thats made Mickey Mouse its international ambassador Not only did she forbid the studio from making a sequel in her will she decreed that no American would ever be allowed to tamper with her Mary Poppins again.SAVING MR.

"Review Saving Mr. Banks predictably magical - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Saving Mr. Banks predictably magicalBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 12/11/2013 105942 AM PSTUpdated 12/11/2013 035312 PM PST Its no surprise that a movie about Disney is so Disney-ish even with one of the main characters spending considerable time complaining about how schmaltzy Disney is.But theres real heart in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" the story of how Walt Disney finally convinced ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers to sell him the rights to her beloved story. Supposedly it took him 20 years to do this after promising his kids he would bring Mary Poppins alive on the big screen. How much of the story is true is questionable but it really doesnt matter. This is a winning tale about the showdown between Disneys eternal optimism and Travers sincere but comedic curmudgeonly attitude. Underneath all that it explores the authors tortured relationship with her father and how it shaped her life -- and maybe film history.Just bring some Kleenex especially if you have daddy issues. Disney wants you to cry and even if youre aware of that and somewhat resent it you probably will anyway. Get over it. Tom Hanks is typically great as Walt (""call me Walt"") Disney portraying the iconic film tycoon as your favorite uncle -- gregarious earnest cheery someone who will happily use kindness to wear you down until his ulterior motives are satisfied. Emma Thompson is magnetic playing the haughty British author Travers who treats her story like a devoted Christian would her Bible. She doesnt understand the United States she abhors Los Angeles and Disneys ""silly cartoons"" she hates the actors Disney wants to cast and she doesnt particularly care for the music written by the Sherman Brothers one of the most successful songwriting teams in movie history. Shed rather see live penguins dance than watch animated versions -- and doesnt want the color red to appear in the picture. Anywhere. Advertisement ""Ive simply gone off the color"" she says.Set in 1961 the clash of wills between Disney and Travers (who has everyone walking on eggshells around her) is predictably funny and enhanced by a strong cast of supporting actors (including Bradley Whitford Paul Giamatti Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak). On its surface its a fun behind-the-scenes story that most of us didnt know involving two iconic personas. But things get a little more interesting and dicey when the film starts digging up Travers childhood in rural Australia. Its pure pop psychology cliche to suggest that Travers resistance to the great Walt Disney was rooted in her own childhood issues and it could be insulting to Travers memory if not handled correctly. Fortunately it mostly works. For one thing the acting in the subplot is first rate. Colin Farrell plays Robert Goff Travers the writers charming rogue of an alcoholic father while Annie Rose Buckley is wonderful as the young Travers. Its difficult to not feel a tremendous amount of empathy for these characters. That in turn builds empathy for the adult Travers. There are some bumps along the way though including a lack of focus on why Travers is putting herself through hell with Disney in America. The filmmakers assume we know its because she needs the money but thats not depicted convincingly. Is she really a miserable person who needs Disney to prompt her to sift through her past thereby saving her? Or is it Disney who makes her miserable? Or both? ""Mr. Banks"" is directed by John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") who obviously does well with syrupy tales. But even if this comes off like an ad for Disney its convincing and contains some of Disneys patented magic -- especially with a predictable yet effective emotional ending. To expect anything different from Disney wouldnt be realistic. (L-R) Tom Hanks as Walt Disney shows Disneyland to Emma Thompson as Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks.

What studio is going to make a movie about getting into bed (literally) with Disney than Disney itself? Saving Mr. Banks turns Traverss tense collaboration with Walt (Tom Hanks) and his team of Imagineers into--naturally--a schmaltzy journey of closure climaxing in a teary screening of the finished musical. Like Julie amp; Julia the movie toggles between two imbalanced halves Every time it cuts away to Traverss dreamlike Australian girlhood and alcoholic dad (Colin Farrell) you wish you were back on the lot watching her argue with chirpy song composers and the impulses of commercialization. (Seriously animated penguins?) No need to mention which side prevails--its a small world after all. But for a while you can enjoyably ally yourself with a cynical foot-dragger.

Photo Francois Duhamel/Disney MOVIE REVIEW Saving Mr. Banks A.A. Milne watch out Running time 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 (alcoholism). At the Cinema 1 the E-Walk the Loews East Village. A heaping spoonful of saccharine a barrel of industrial-grade schmaltz a pinch of vinegar -- and ingratiating performances by Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks -- go only so far in helping the shameless self-promotion that is ""Saving Mr. Banks go down. Walt Disney was infamous for not only twisting literary works to his own creative ends -- hardly unusual in Hollywood -- but for aggressively supplanting the originals even in print with ""the Disney version. His artistic heirs have upped the ante with this glorified infomercial celebrating his strong-arming of author P.L. Travers into letting him film ""Mary Poppins his way and at the same time aggressively congratulating Uncle Walt for doing her (and the world) a huge favor. ""Its what we storytellers do We restore order with imagination Hanks Disney tells Thompsons Pamela Travers in the films most risible scene. He cajoles her into accepting that the only way shell come to come to terms with her troubled childhood in Australia is by sharing his version of ""Mary Poppins with the world. In interminable and awkwardly staged flashbacks a terrible Colin Farrell plays Travers beloved father a whimsical but irresponsible bank clerk whose prodigious alcoholic consumption reduces the family to genteel poverty at the very end of the railroad line. Director John Lee Hancock (""The Alamo) wrings more entertainment value out of the 60ish Travers arrival in 1961 Hollywood when the Englishwomans strained financial straits forces her to finally entertain Disney s two decades of attempts to purchase ""Mary Poppins. (Paul Giamatti is thanklessly cast as her chauffeur with a handicapped daughter). Travers refuses to sign over the rights unless Disney grants her creative control -- but the avuncular and ruthless studio head and his team steamroller all of her many objections including the use of animation songs flying the casting of Dick Van Dyke and the color red. Neither the ""Mary Poppins"" stars nor its director (Robert Stevenson) are meaningfully depicted in what amounts to film about the movies pre-production rather than its actual making. The creative team is represented by writer Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak respectively) who perform a good portion of the ""Mary Poppins score for the mostly horrified Travers (Thompson is great by the way). Shes ultimately less concerned about protecting the integrity of Mary Poppins -- loosely inspired by an aunt briefly played in the flashbacks by Rachel Griffiths -- than the prospect of building up the subsidiary character of Mr. Banks whos based on her father. In the Disneyfied happy ending were led to believe shes weeping tears of happiness at the premiere of ""Mary Poppins. In fact she spent the rest of her long life badmouthing the movie refusing to authorize a sequel -- and in her 90s granting stage rights only on the express condition that no Americans were involved. Except for a couple of isolated mildly subversive moments Hanks is basically playing the genial host of ""The Wonderful World of Disney rather than an actual person whose unseen chain-smoking led to his death of cancer five years later. Forcing Travers to take a tour of Disneyland hes a master salesman -- and ""Saving Mr. Banks is ultimately much less about magic than making the sale in more ways than one.

Daily Edition Login to download Saving Mr. Banks London Review 259 PM PDT 10/20/2013 by Leslie Felperin FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An affecting if somewhat soft-soaped comedy drama elevated by excellent performances. TWITTER Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney trying to convince Emma Thompsonas P.L. Travers to let him adapt ""Mary Poppins"" in this story inspired by Hollywood history. According to this based-on-a-true-story account of the making of Mary Poppins when Walt Disney offered to buy the rights to P.L. Travers book the author insisted on just two things that she would retain script approval and that there would be no animation. History shows that she didnt exactly get her way at least as far as the animation was concerned. But dancing penguins aside Saving Mr. Banks suggests that Travers put up a good fight going sturdy-pump-to-brogue with Disney then one of the most powerful studio heads in the business. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smiths ingenious script which famously featured on Franklin Leonards Black List adroitly builds layers on top of this central conflict using flashbacks to reveal how bleak events in Pamela Lyndon Travers childhood nourished the cheerful story of Mary Poppins making her so protective of her work. The finished product directed by John Lee Hancock is a cunningly effective if rather on-the-nose study of the transformation of pain into art marbled with moments of high comedy. Some contrarians will balk at the highly sympathetic depiction of Walt Disney himself (played by Tom Hanks) hardly a surprise given that the logo of the company he founded opens the credits. However audiences will swallow this tasty spoonful of sugar without complaint. A most delightful box-office result should be expected when it opens in the U.S. Dec. 13 (two weeks after Britain) a frame well chosen to maximize the family market and position the film in the awards-season calendar. STORY Tom Hanks on Becoming Walt Disney for Saving Mr. Banks In a part once mooted for Meryl Streep Emma Thompson takes charge of the central role of the waspish P.L. Travers with an authority that makes you wonder how anybody else could ever have been considered. Firing off withering perfectly timed put-downs in a musical Received Pronunciation accent (disguising the characters Australian origins) with the confident stride of a governess tidying up the nursery shes a fearsome figure of feminine steeliness. Theres an echo here of Sandra Bullocks Tiger Mom in Hancocks The Blind Side except that Travers is considerably less maternal despite being a childrens writer. When a woman with a babe-in-arms on the plane to Los Angeles offers to move her own hand luggage to make room for Travers bag she offers no thanks and only asks if ""the child will be a nuisance"" on the flight. Only a glancing allusion in the script betrays that the real Travers did in fact have an adopted child but then theres quite a lot else about her presumably in the interests of making the character more accessible that scribes Marcel and Smith have declined to incorporate. Apparently there were also rumored affairs with women and an interest in mysticism and the occult though there is only a shot here of her reading a book by guru George Gurdjieff to show for it. The end credits thank author Valerie Lawson for inspiration from her respected biography Mary Poppins She Wrote The Life of P.L. Travers but a warts-and-all portrait was never going to happen on a film with this big a budget and this much visibility at stake. That goes double or more for the portrait drawn of Walt Disney. The twinkly-eyed avuncular figure incarnated by a mustachioed Hanks -- who only for a fleeting moment shows off a glower worthy of a mafia crime boss ordering a hit -- couldnt be further from the negative depictions of Disney in say Richard Schickels scathing biography The Disney Version or the recent Philip Glass opera The Perfect American. Some no doubt will call this a whitewash but looked at from the viewpoint of the studio and the estate of Walt Disney Saving Mr. Banks presents a grittier version of Disney than one might have expected 10 or even five years ago. Okay so theres no mention here of strike-breaking or informing on suspected Communists to the FBI but at least its conceded that not everyone was enchanted by Walts magic kingdom and that there were murky shadows in his own biography like an abusive father. Heck they even show him smoking and thats way worse than being an FBI informant these days. Taken strictly on its own terms Saving Mr. Banks works exceedingly well as mainstream entertainment. At first a classic fish out of water with her haughty Old World ways when she lands in laid-back informal 1961 Hollywood Mrs. Travers (as she insists on being called) is gradually won over by Walt and staff. Three men in particular are tasked with coaxing her script approval and trust writer Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) composer Richard Sherman (Jason Schwartzman) and his lyricist brother Robert Sherman (B.J. Novak). The last two really have their work cut out for them given Travers is only mildly less resistant to having songs in the film than she is to animation. As they slug it out in the rehearsal room over the script (she even quibbles over the wording of the scene headings) golden-hued flashbacks to Travers own Australian childhood uncover the scars that her writing of Mary Poppins would try to heal. Like Mr. Banks in the book Pamelas father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell doing his best work for some time) was a bank manager who had a temper at times but there the parallels end. An alcoholic whose irresponsibility pulled his family down the social scale hes seen as a child-man always eager to participate in their games. Clearly Mary Poppins the character inherited something from him as she did from Pamelas aunt (Rachel Griffiths) who shows up with a carpetbag full of wonders just when the family most needs help. Ultimately Mary Poppins turns out to be an idealized version of Pamela Travers nee Helen Goff herself and its only when Disney figures out how to lift the veil hanging over her own backstory that he can persuade her to let go of her creation. The scene where Disney plays amateur shrink to secure the signature he needs is the scripts clumsiest most irritating misstep despite the laudable efforts of Hanks and Thompson to save it. Profoundly anachronistic with its smattering of psychobabble notions it represents a shameless bit of self-flattery aimed at the industry and no doubt awards bodies with lines like ""Its what we storytellers do We restore order with imagination."" Likewise more anachronism in the service of sappiness is deployed elsewhere when Travers presents her chauffeur (Paul Giamatti otherwise endearing) with a list of famous people -- Albert Einstein Frida Kahlo etc. -- with disabilities to provide inspiration for his wheelchair-bound daughter. Oh come on barely anyone outside Mexico or France and a few art buffs knew who Frida Kahlo was in 1961. However these are faults most mainstream viewers probably wont notice or even mind especially if they read Saving Mr. Banks as a charming work of fiction a creation not that much more fantastical than stories about nannies that fly. Folks will swallow anything if its done well enough a point charmingly made near the films end when Travers attends the premiere at Graumans Chinese Theatre. For the most part the camera holds on Travers face bathed in the reflected bluish light from the screen as she cries at the parts weve learned meant the most to her smiles at the jokes and winces during the dancing penguins. As well as the outstanding performances by the leads and supporting cast sturdy craft contributions from all departments add polish while the use of what looks like the real Disney Burbank facility adds veracity. (The Australian locales however are far less convincing-looking.) The picture gets an extra lift from the extensive use of the cracking original songs written by the Sherman Brothers for Mary Poppins which mesh nicely with Thomas Newmans newly composed score. Theyre inventively woven into the story and used for dramatic counterpoint making this on one level a musical in itself but with borrowed songs. Presumably the producers of Saving Mr. Banks had no trouble clearing the rights.

She is on Oscar-winning form in Saving Mr Banks playing Mary Poppins author Pamela Travers as a cross between Jeremy Paxman and Maggie Smith in Downton Abbey. On a plane from London to Los Angeles she peers down her spectacles at a toddler lips pinched Will the child be a nuisance? It is an 11-hour flight. Mrs T is on her way to lock horns with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) who has been courting her for the film rights to her beloved Mary Poppins for 20 years. Flat broke she cant say no but Disney stands for everything she hates I wont have her turned into one of your silly cartoons. You have to feel a bit sorry for Travers. This a Disney film so Uncle Walt gets an easy ride twinkly and kind - with no sign of the controlling darkly driven side of the man. Its Travers who gets lumbered with the issues - daddy issues. Flashbacks (a few too many) to her chaotic childhood in Australia explain why shes a stickler for rules. Colin Farrell (who also twinkles but not half as much as Hanks) plays her alcoholic father - a dreamer full of tall tales to cast spells on little girls but not enough sense to hold down a job. Like the Banks family in Mary Poppins this lot are in need of a firm hand and a stiff broom. And here we get a glimpse of the inspiration for Mary Poppins when Traverss aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths) sweeps into the house with a carpet bag. Back in LA Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak offer a cute double act as the Mary Poppins songwriters who hide their draft of Supercalifragilistic from Traverss prying eyes. The whole thing goes down with a few bucketloads of sugar. What keeps it from becoming sticky schmaltz is Thompson who plays Travers with wit and warmth adding a spoonful of spoilt child to help the battleaxe go down. Think of Saving Mr Banks as a welcome-to-Christmas movie. A little too sugary but in keeping with the season.

Tom Hanks delivers an avuncular Walt Disney and everyones favourite posh aunt Emma Thompson plays the self righteous English spinster to a T.

Emma Thompson gives one of her best performances as the grumpy P.L. Travers. She totally steals the show even making Tom Hanks a mere supporting actor. Paul Giamatti is superb too and is part of the most emotive scenes in the movie. It made me laugh and cry at the same time.

Hank and Farrell are good and Thompson is excellent. A film to make you cry and think as the film slowly peels away the layers of just what the book and the film were all about.

Disney had promised his daughters that he would produce a film of their favourite book 20 years previous to where it starts in 1961. The film follows two timelines. One is Pamela Travers childhood growing up in an isolated house in arid Queensland Australia. You find her idolising her father who encourages her imagination to flourish. The father played by Colin Farrell is good-looking charismatic and doting on his children. However this hero worship is found floundering as her fathers alcoholism bad health and inability to hold down a job in the local bank develops. The other timeline finds Mrs Travers settled in London in 1961 but with funds running out her plush Chelsea home is under threat. She is reminded by her agent that her royalties from her original books are drying up and the only way she can keep her house is by fronting up to the Disney proposal of her book being made into a film which she has avoided for the last 20 years. Emma Thompson plays the lead role of Pamela Travers who arrives in California as a tea drinking handbag carrying Englishwoman. She fires out putdowns like an infant with a cap gun looking down her nose in a derisory fashion. She really does rally with the perceived pomposity and snobbishness of the British as she picked up on the American enthusiasm consumerism gushing politeness service grammar and penchant for sugary foods. Was it just me or was there a healthy dose of Margaret Thatcher in Thompsons portrayal? Hankss Disney is on the other hand good humoured personable and warmth personified. The movie is how these two personalities as flag bearers of their national cultures intertwine. Is the American enthusiasm for life often scorned upon by their trans-Atlantic cousins a false a natural enthusiasm for life and risk taking? Is the English stereotype of stern reservation a natural defence against eventual disappointment? It certainly seems to be the case that the Disney happiness does eventually start to seep into Traverss negativity. However where would Disney be without the stories from the Old World? Their output at that time certainly is dominated by Kiplings Jungle Book Bedknobs and Broomsticks and AA Milnes Winnie the Pooh. The film explores these contrasts and the influence on family. On the exterior this film could be described as a feel-good story but you dont have to think about it much to explore darker thoughts. This film is sure to be talked about in terms of awards not only in terms of the lead cast but also in the direction production and cinematography. I thoroughly recommend it.

Were reminded every year at Christmas when Love Actually comes on. The scene where shes given the CD gets me every time. Ten years on she shows surprisingly similar moments in Saving Mr Banks. Good old fashioned British stoicism is obviously her forte and she carries the film fantastically as Mrs Travers the author of Mary Poppins. This film simultaneously tells two stories. Walt Disneys wooing of Mrs Travers in order to obtain the movie rights for her famous book; and Mrs Travers rocky childhood in Australia. The juxtaposition of the two is clever. Through the eyes of Mrs Travers as a child we see what influenced her iconic story. Mary Poppins fans like me will enjoy spotting the references to the Disney film throughout. The obvious ones include that parrot umbrella an unsuccessful trip to the bank and of course the musical score. Those who are less familiar with Mary Poppins (what on earth did you watch on sick days from school?) wont miss out too much. After all the film touches on some serious and thought-provoking themes - parenthood alcoholism suicide even. I cried twice in fact. But it also explores a fundamentally fun one the ultimate clash between stiff upper-lipped Britishness and all singing all dancing (quite literally) American consumerism. Its like watching the Queen visit McDonalds hate it at first but then ask Philip for another Big Mac. Overall this is a great film for all. My boyfriend even liked it - and he usually only likes films advertised with aggressively grey posters. Make sure you dont rush out to beat the traffic - theres a mid-credit treat.

This story of a story is an insight into the lives of two people known for their creations the lives behind the characters. Using actual footage and archives the nostalgia of Chim Chiminy and Lets Go Fly A Kite this film tells us of Walt Disneys perseverance and promise to turn the beloved story of the flying Nanny and her carpet bag into a film. A reluctant and prim P. L. Travers has evaded Disneys grasp for the past 20 years. We meet her as she finally gives in to his request to at least try and begrudgingly heads to Los Angeles to convince him that his whimsical hip hopping animated musicals are not fit for realistic sensible Mary Poppins. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson never fail to disappoint and the strong supporting cast bring the joy of Mary Poppins into the story of its cinematic birth. The familiar songs invite you to revisit your childhood the awkward encounters between jolly ""Walt"" and no-nonsense ""Mrs Travers"" give you a chuckle and the flash backs to Australia and the fraught childhood of the author make you shed a tear.

Its clear from the start of John Lee Hancock ""Saving Mr. Banks"" that ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) for all the dizzy sweetness of her most famous creation doesnt have much joy in her own life. She doesnt really have much of anything actually - no family no friends and a dwindling fortune shes suddenly forced to finally bolster by (maybe) selling the film rights for her books to Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) - but she does have a deep love for both Poppins and her Banks family even if that gets in the way of judicious business dealings. As it so happens Travers and her books have been the object of Walts cinematic desires for nearly two decades and the visionary studio head wants nothing more than he wants to bring Mary to the big screen. He loves Mary his screenwriter loves Mary his songwriting duo loves Mary and he thinks he knows how to bring her off the page so that moviegoers everywhere can love Mary. Travers however isnt biting (even if she is inclined to bite peoples heads clean off). Set in 1964 Hancocks film brings to life the story behind the beloved story chronicling the fraught relationship between the difficult Travers and the dreamy Disney as the pair tango (and tangle) over just how Mary can make the jump to the big screen. Strapped for cash Travers journeys to sunny Los Angeles (which the Aussie attempting to pass herself off as a Brit predictably hated) to try to wrest the rights away from Disney or make it so he will only make a production she expressly approves of. What ultimately happens is well a bit of a surprise (at least if youre willing to temporarily forget that ""Mary Poppins"" did make it to the big screen). ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is principally preoccupied with Travers nuttiness and her unwilling to yield to just about any suggestion doled out by the Disney crew and is thus tasked with sharing just why the author was so harsh (and so cuckoo). The film attempts to explain Travers prickly nature by reaching back to her traumatic childhood necessitating the use of frequent flashbacks to her younger years in the dusty Australian countryside. Its a contrivance that works suitably well especially as the film requires some sort of reasoning why a person would grow up to be so cold that theyd shove a giant Mickey Mouse doll into a corner (this happens). Somewhat surprisingly ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is nothing if not gentle and the films treatment of Travers alcoholic father cunningly stays within that spirit. Robert Goff Travers (yes P.L.s eventual name change is discussed in the film and no its not confusing within the context of the film) as charmingly played by Colin Farrell is never portrayed as some sort of outsized monster but a grown man with a terrible problem he feels powerless to control. The film does try to slowly reveal that Travers affection for the fictional Banks family is actually rooted in her affection for her own fractured family but while Hancocks direction and Kelly Marcel and Sue Smiths script try to make that seem like some kind of staggering plot twist its obvious from the start thats where things are going. While its not a manipulative choice it does make ""Saving Mr. Banks"" try to appear clever in ways that it is unable to (and that it quite frankly shouldnt even attempt). The film is uncomfortably plagued by its own looming legacy - the real-life P.L. Travers who was apparently a lot more than just a pill notoriously hated the film version of her beloved book (especially all that damn animation) to the point that she never allowed Disney to make another film about their beloved Mary Poppins - a hard fact that dilutes some of the features prodigious power. As a fairy tale in its own right however ""Saving Mr. Banks"" works and works damn well. Consider it a feature about preventing heartache and denial in the world complete with a misunderstood villain and a magical wizard and the film zips right by in a totally pleasing manner. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" also benefits from a string of solid performances from its stacked cast. Hanks portrayal of Disney is whimsical compelling stuff and he easily stays away from parody in order to deliver a solid turn as the visionary. It may not be his best work this year - thats still ""Captain Phillips"" - but its still a big feather in his large hat. Thompsons talent and simmering charm allow the prickly Travers to come across as multi-faceted and rich even when shes acting like a complete maniac (her early demand that the color red not appear anywhere in the film is particularly bonkers but Thompson even infuses that with some relatability). As the prolific Sherman brothers Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak are quite a dashing pair with Novak taking on the mantel of the more sardonic of the duo (his Robert Sherman is prone to pushing Travers) and as Richard Sherman Schwartzman charmingly serving as the more solicitous of the pair (who knew Schwartzman could be this sweet and earnest?). The Shermans are tasked alongside an incredibly amusing Bradley Whitford as screenwriter Don DaGradi with getting the films script up to snuff and the interactions between the four are consistently hilarious and (appropriately) bizarre. Paul Giamatti also makes the most of a relatively small part as Travers Los Angeles driver and his deeply human discussions with Travers (which of course have to evolve over time as the author slowly breaks down) inject the film with surprisingly sweet emotion. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" has all of the pieces in place to earmark it as a masterpiece - a stirring story real life roots wonderful performances and a rich visual background - but it doesnt fully deliver on its promise. Theres charm and delight here to be sure but it is occasionally obscured by attempts to make it somehow darker deeper and more dramatic. Its a realistic fairy tale fair and square and the film works best when it allows its whimsy and sweetness to mingle with the harsh light of real life not falling too squarely to either side. Its a biopic that benefits from yes a spoonful of sugar to help it all go down. SCORE 7.9 / 10 ""Saving Mr. Banks"" will be released on December 20th.

Travers battles with Walt Disney over the making of ""Mary Poppins"" are fun to watch but its really all about art and artists An adult daughter of an alcoholic meets the granddaddy of all inner-child-enablers in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" a whimsical moving and occasionally insightful tale of author P.L. Travers clashing with Walt Disney over the moguls decades-long effort to bring her beloved novel ""Mary Poppins"" to the big screen. Even when ""Mr. Banks"" gets brazenly manipulative within parameters Walt himself would have approved it gleefully assaults both the heart and the pleasure center. Perhaps most surprisingly what could have merely been a studios love letter to itself -- timed not coincidentally for the upcoming 50th anniversary of ""Mary Poppins"" -- winds up being a meditation on the power that art has for artists as a way to exorcise the past. The film begins in 1961 with Travers (Emma Thompson""gt;Emma Thompson) running out of money and finally agreeing to travel from London to Los Angeles to meet with Disney (Tom Hanks) who has spent the last 20 years trying to convince her to let him film her book. Even with the promise of script approval shes been hesitant to sign off out of fear that he will make her creation too cheery and sparkly. See video Tom Hanks Works His Magic as Walt Disney in First Saving Mr. Banks Trailer Those two adjectives hardly apply to the brusque Travers who immediately condescends to or outright insults everyone who crosses her path at the studio from screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) to legendary songwriters Robert (B.J. Novak) and Richard Sherman (Jason Schwartzman). She even tells Disney that she doesnt want Mary Poppins to become ""one of your silly cartoons"" ignoring the shocked and hurt look on his face. The Burbank sunshine prompts flashbacks to her own early life; while she presents herself as veddy British Travers actually grew up in Australia as young Helen Goff (Annie Buckley) with a father (Colin Farrell) who was a banker a charmer a dreamer -- and a drinker. We see how this charismatic wreck created a storyteller and inspired the unhappy banker Mr. Banks and for the grown-up Travers making a ""Mary Poppins"" movie can only work if it vindicates the character and ultimately her father.

Hearing the Shermans sing ""Lets Go Fly a Kite"" doesnt hurt either. Working from a script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith director John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"" ""The Rookie"") luxuriates in the period detail of early-60s Disney-ana from the studio itself (lucky for the production the buildings have been scrupulously maintained and unchanged for 70 years or so) to Disneyland but his real skill lies in coasting over the screenplays more shameless moments. For instance theres a conversation between Travers and her kindly studio driver about his disabled daughter that could have been horrendously treacly in the wrong hands but Emma Thompson and Paul Giamatti strip the scene down and find the poignancy in it. Also read Captain Phillips Review Taut Suspense Iffy Racial Politics Unfussy Tom Hanks (Video) The performances are terrific all around. It seems at first as though Hanks is merely twinkly stunt-casting but his big final speech about the power of storytelling provides one of the films most affecting moments. (He also rides the Disneyland carousel like a politician down to the ""I see you"" move popularized on ""Veep."" But hey it is his kingdom after all.) With ""Saving Mr. Banks"" and ""Captain Phillips"" Hanks has two of the years strongest acting turns under his belt. Its Thompsons show all the way of course. Audio recordings of the real-life Travers under the closing credits show that the actress has done a superb job of capturing the writers clipped tone and manner even if the photographs of the real author suggest that she looks less like the star of ""Sense and Sensibility"" and more like Hermione Gingold. The flashbacks are powerful but the payoff comes from watching Thompson as the grown-up still battling the ghosts of her past. And one of the take-away moments of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" comes from the simple act of watching Travers watch the screen version of ""Mary Poppins"" for the first time -- her expression alternates between joy and befuddlement (Travers apparently never cared for Dick Van Dyke or animated penguins) all wrapped up in an emotional breakthrough. (Not that ""Saving Mr. Banks"" should be taken as historical gospel since many accounts claim that Travers ended her Hollywood experience none too taken with either Mr. Disney or his movie.) Also read Free Birds Review This Animated Thanksgiving Comedy Is Pure Gobble-dygook Farrell perfectly conveys both the charisma and the failings of this turn-of-the-century Irishman and Ruth Wilson is fragile and devastating as his put-upon wife. (Rachel Griffiths shows up as young Helens no-nonsense umbrella-carrying aunt who clearly inspired the chore-minded flying nanny.) ""Saving Mr. Banks"" reminds us of why we watch movies yes but it also provides insight into why people make them suggesting that in some cases the creators enjoy an even bigger catharsis than their audiences.

Somewhere Uncle Walt is smiling. The Mouse House impresarios protracted courtship of novelist P.L. Travers to secure the film rights to her ""Mary Poppins"" has all the makings of an irresistible backstage tale and its been brought to the screen with a surplus of old-fashioned Disney showmanship in ""Saving Mr. Banks."" Thick with affection for Hollywoods most literal ""dream factory"" and wry in its depiction of the studio filmmaking process director John Lee Hancocks ""Sunset Blvd."" lite (which opens Dec. 13 after London and AFI festival berths) should earn far more than tuppence from holiday audiences -- and from awards voters who can scarcely resist this sort of mash note to the magic of movies (e.g. ""Argo"" ""The Artist"").This story first appeared in the October 29 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Given its now-classic status among several generations of moviegoers its easy to forget that ""Mary Poppins"" seemed far from a sure bet when it first appeared in 1964 given Disneys spotty record as a producer of live-action fare. And one can easily imagine a fascinating film of its own devoted to the production of ""Poppins"" from the canny casting of Julie Andrews (after shed been passed over for the concurrent film version of ""My Fair Lady"") to the creation of the films backlot matte-painted London and the pioneering visual effects of Peter Ellenshaw. But ""Saving Mr. Banks"" has a somewhat different story to tell about the ways in which life influences fiction the ownership writers feel over their creations and the conflicts and compromises responsible for bringing some of the most iconic Hollywood movies into existence. The film opens on images of blue skies and palm trees that suggest L.A. or Beverly Hills. But in fact were in rural Australia circa 1906 where the young Travers (nee Helen Goff played by newcomer Annie Rose) comes of age as one of three daughters of a harried mother (Ruth Wilson) and a loving but manic father (an excellent Colin Farrell) given to drink and more adept at inventing tall tales than at navigating the world of grown-up responsibility. This sets up the primary structural device of Kelly Marcel and Sue Smiths screenplay which continues to move back and forth between Travers formative years and her Disney (mis)adventures gradually revealing the people and events from the authors past whose aura can be felt in her most famous literary creation (including a stern aunt played by Rachel Griffiths in proto-Poppins mode). With her sharp clipped diction and a wrought-iron upper lip Travers (Emma Thompson superb) has been steadily pursued by Disney (Tom Hanks) for 20 years by the time she finally agrees to meet him in L.A. -- a decision prompted more by financial need than by any real desire to see her work brought to the screen. So beyond the carefully manicured hedgerows of Disneys art-deco Burbank studios (where much of the pic was shot) we go as a game of inches ensues the willful author whos never so much as laid eyes on a screenplay resisting even the slightest change to her vision; and the canny family-entertainment magnate gently nudging the project toward the movie he knows the public will want to see. Much of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" unfolds in a small rehearsal studio where Travers sits stoic and unimpressed as three of the movies principal architects give her their best pitch Veteran Disney animator and ""Poppins"" co-screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and longtime studio songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman (warmly played in spot-on characterizations by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak). Considering that Travers arrives steadfast in her belief that a ""Poppins"" films should include no musical numbers or animated sequences they have their work cut out for them. (Though ""Saving Mr. Banks"" builds towards a cathartic happy ending in real life Travers then well into her 90s authorized producer Cameron Mackintoshs stage version of ""Poppins"" only on the condition that no one from the film version including the Shermans be involved.) Hancock who cut his own directorial teeth at the studio (on the inspirational baseball drama ""The Rookie"" and the underrated ""The Alamo"") is sometimes a bit too on-the-nose with his parallel storytelling too heavy with Thomas Newmans bouncy score and too eager to pluck at our heartstrings (at which he nevertheless succeeds). But if 2007s ""Enchanted"" remains undisputed as the great impish postmodern riff on Disney iconography ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is the unapologetically retro valentine Disney himself might have made. Its a bit square never particularly surprising yet very rich in its sense of creative people and their spirit of self-reinvention -- the Outback girl refashioned as a prim and proper British lady the Missouri farm boy who turned himself into a cross between Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz. And if someone had to play Disney in a movie a better candidate than Hanks himself a gleaming icon of wholesome American entertainment is hard to imagine. The actor doesnt try for the real Disneys distinctive Midwestern voice (probably for the best given his hither-and-yon Boston accent in ""Captain Phillips"") but he captures all of his folksy charisma and canny powers of persuasion -- at once father confessor and the shrewdest of businessmen. A couple of anachronistic touches (like a modern-day MGM logo glimpsed in an early airport scene) notwithstanding production designer Michael Corenblith does a highly impressive job of creating sun-scorched turn-of-the-century Australia as well as early-60s L.A. helped by the fact that both the Disney studio and Disneyland itself havent changed all that much in the half-century since. John Schwartzmans warm widescreen lensing and costume designer Daniel Orlandis Kennedy-era costumes lend further polish to a uniformly solid craft roster.

Reply Crescendo says November 10 2013 at 1149 pm Not a badly kept secret a poorly spread rumor. 2 British songwriters composed all the new stage songs for Poppins. Fact. Trust. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says October 26 2013 at 540 am Variety not unlike much of what we think of as ""the media"" show a certain forgiveness in some of these online film reviews; as if to stay in good stead (without becoming an outright flack for the studios) here -- in this instance -- the following ""Hancock who cut his own directorial teeth at the studio (on the inspirational baseball drama ""The Rookie"" and the underrated ""The Alamo"") is sometimes a bit too on-the-nose with his parallel storytelling too heavy with Thomas Newmans bouncy score and too eager to pluck at our heartstrings (at which he nevertheless succeeds)."" Regardless of a movies (lasting) effect...if a film is mediocre then say that. No motion picture is ever ""saved"" by casting or production values its merely ""tolerated"". Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says October 26 2013 at 542 am By the way ""The Alamo"" was a mediocre TV-movie and an unnecessary waste of time money and talent. Reply Am says October 20 2013 at 757 pm This review seems extra-lenient. Does anyone really think this is anything but (polished to a glittering shine as it may well be) holiday trash? Who is the director again? Oh. This shrewdly conceived movie which essentially dramatizes the interplay of artistic creativity with the money-making impulse while glorifying the inner machinations of a huge corporation (dream-factory) in the process is just selling the idea of commercialization back to us wringing out until-now unforseen droplets of money from the studio vault and the memory of its own beloved creator. It does this by not only mythologizing the character at the center of the Poppins story and its author (fine) but also those who worked so tirelessly and proactively (you better believe it) to transfer the book to the screen. I mean really is there any doubt what was (necessarily sure) driving them? If not money then what just good old power? Heartwarming. Seems to me this origin story sees all involved as artists above businessmen thereby covertly peddling the concepts of capitalism further dressed up (packaged) in the guise of how the legend was born sentimentality back to an already() consumerist society. This is distasteful and what the film cant escape signifying in the larger discourse. Will it vie for awards consideration in the industry? I dont know is the world we live in sort of cynical? Im looking (hopefully) to Frozen as a sign of Disneys continued creative relevance in the marketplace not this. Reply Jones says October 22 2013 at 517 am So a movie that reportedly cost less than 35 million USD and features and actual script and real actors shot for a 2D presentation is the enemy now? Why not rant against Iron Man 3 Pirates 4 or any other insipid 200 million plus franchise flick? I personally am more than grateful that there are still a few modestly budgeted script driven movies in ""real 2D"" without an army of CG ""characters""... Reply Am says October 23 2013 at 1215 am Point taken regarding the selection of response. But I am only one person and obviously not making a living from criticism (where an opinion on everything is required). I dont know for some reason hearing people buzzing about this movie from that trailer and then reading this review which in the end lets the filmmakers get away with reprehensible lazy (you say 35 mil budget?) anachronisms like the new MGM logo made me want to say something. The real issue is the quality of the review here. Believe me I was surprised as anybody to discover only a few short years back that Variety had some of the sharpest most sophisticated criticism out if them all. It seems to have gone a little downhill lately to the regretable point I dont know if I trust their veracity anymore. For more proof just look at the over-the-top stuff proclaimed about Gravity out of Venice. I realize the film was probably perceieved as a sensation amongst the audience there but the serious critics know (or should know in my opinion) better. Does anyone else have the feeling something very upsetting is happening over there these days... Young Contrarian says October 21 2013 at 1010 am Wow its like youve actually seen the movie - but more than likely havent. You would have me believe a more interesting story would be that Mary Poppins was the product of hand-wringing ill-treated artists struggling against an unyielding boorish and jaded studio machine who is force-feeding tripe on a dim-witted audience unwilling to see much less accept the efforts of the truly gifted. Ya thatd pack em in for sure especially if you throw in a couple of musical numbers. Conceptually Im not sure how being shrewd is necessarily a bad thing in Hollywood these days. Especially when it seems in such short supply with so many other efforts. Reply Am says October 21 2013 at 624 pm Nothing wrong with being shrewd per se but I didnt exactly mean it as a compliment here. And no I dont think that would make a more interesting story or a better one than whats already there. Theyre both terribly thought-through ideas. And what would you have me believe -- that despite what Ive pointed to we actually have a new Xmas classic on our hands?? Enrique ""Henery"" Uglesias says October 20 2013 at 709 pm This was hardly the sequel to ""Saving Private Ryan"" I was looking for. Just Tom Hanks walking around with a Hitler mustache acting like Magnum P.I.E. being touchy feely with all babes on the Disney lot. Tom Groped his way though the film. But they never got to that ""Epic Battle Scene"" where the plains bomb the NAZI tanks and Private Banks takes out his UZI and says... ""This is for Marry Poppins"" And those kids from the Gnome Mobile theyve grown up and got GOVERNMENT JOBS Hollywood doesnt make that much money anymore Next Private Hanks will get his money from private BANK Then Mac Damon can give him many THANKS Because he never switched RANKS .......I WOULD BE YOUR HERO BABY Reply Just Confused says October 20 2013 at 551 pm Wouldnt it be sumpin if this OLD-FASHIONED warm-hearted film...well told and acted... made tons of money.....and NEW HOLLYWOOD decided that a film concept LIKE THAT would be worth trying to copy? Wouldnt that be sumpin. Reply MovieGeek says October 20 2013 at 335 pm I cant wait for this Reply cadavra says October 20 2013 at 309 pm Its a badly-kept secret that many of the new numbers for the stage version of POPPINS were in fact written surreptitiously by the Shermans-a delicious little irony. Reply Lisa Guzzen says October 20 2013 at 307 pm Cannot wait for this movie. It looks amazing in the trailer and this review is great. Cant wait Reply lil meathead (jazzt) says October 21 2013 at 755 am I saw the film last night . This review is perfect. It describes the movie to a tee. i would love for it to do really well. Its a feel good film and the acting is stellar the script even better. Cant wait for more people to see it and hopefully see it do well during awards season Reply See All 15 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO President On Vinyls Demise On-Screen Violence -TCA Tyler Posey Teen Wolf Star Regrets Im Gay Video -- I Am...
