I expected Star Wars or similar sci-fi debates amongst underachieving nerds; crassly inventive testosterone-fueled trash talk I might require a translator to decipher; and the sometimes soft center that lies beneath the adolescent exteriors of the potty-mouth masters characters. Example Silent Bobs remorseful diner soliloquy in Chasing Amy. In other words though Ive been entertained by some of Smiths movies my expectations were low. Zack and Miri contains all the above Smith ingredients but not in the usual proportions. Or setting. And for some tastes it might prove to be a perfected recipe. I didnt need a translator after all (though I brought one just in case). Except near the end of the film but Jay a.k.a. Lester the Molester Cockenstuff (I think I had a doll with that name once ... oh wait ... that was H.R. Pufnstuf) thankfully translates for everyone. Oh theres still plenty of sex and sex jokes and sex scenes and of course sex talk. But its not a story full of sex. Sex is the story. Well sex on film. Childhood friends and roommates Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) find themselves in dire straits when they cant make rent or pay their utility bills. After an evening of cozily huddling around a flaming trash barrel in their living room for warmth Zack has an idea. Inspired by the gay porn star he met at his darkly hilarious high school reunion he convinces Miri to back his brilliant financial bailout plan -- to make a porno. The ragtag cast and crew he rustles up include his Bean-N-Gone coffee shop co-barista Delaney (Craig Robinson The Office) Lester and real-life porn star Traci Lords as Bubbles (blowing where few if any women have blown before). Delaneys philosophical deadpan delivery of some of the films best one-liners steals more than a few scenes. Its the dialogue -- and singular Smith wit -- in every scene that makes this risque spin on the cliche rom-com formula stand out in a cinematic crowd. Humor thats sidesplittingly disgustingly (in a good way) and sometimes sentimentally (bordering on sappy) honest. BTW the flicks soft center isnt just the love story its the oft-uttered notion that minimum-wage misfits can truly step out (or up) from behind their incarcerating coffee (and other shop) counters -- to be presidents and vice-presidents of their own Tamp;A productions. All in all its a modern-day Kevin Smith fairytale a big-screen bearing perhaps of his soul at its sincerest and wittiest if not filthiest. (Or most pretentiously political or profound). Intelligent insightful idiotic and unfortunately at times a little too generous with mainstream Hollywood meet-cute mushiness. This raunchy and dysfunctional romantic sexual smorgasbord may or may not please fans of the director/writer. Or Mormons. Still it should delight plenty of other movie diners especially those who might enjoy a chef Smith creation thats spicy on the outside slightly gooey on the inside and ultimately satisfying very satisfying. Grade B+ (The breakdown A for snappy; B for excess sentimentality. So close to an A-.)

The director of Clerks has also had to deal with the inexorable rise of new more talented comedy mastermind Judd Apatow. Now Smith appears to be fighting back borrowing Apatow alumni Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks for a high-concept comedy romp about a pair of platonic friends who team up to conquer the adult-movie market with unwanted romantic consequences. Though it was made months before the current financial crisis the films early stages feel bizarrely relevant as our cash-strapped heroes find themselves out of options and dignity and so opt for the only opportunity left to them. This first act showcases the films strengths Rogen and Banks make for very affable leads and Smiths script while leaving very little to the imagination is nicely paced and studded with more than a few memorable one liners.But as matters progress from dirty chat to actual onscreen humping the problems increasingly become apparent. The narrative goes out of its way to unite the basest preoccupations of a decade of gross-out comedy bodily functions gay jokes race relations and the hilarious marital habits of black folks all tied up in a torrent of filthy language that would make Eddie Murphy blush. Smith may have pioneered this kind of upfront sex chat but the Apatow team refined it. Zack and Miri feels uncomfortably like a gruesome game of filth-talk oneupmanship and its hard to care who comes out on top.

Miri and Zack are two 30-something losers (with a capital L) who just like the U.S. Fed suddenly find themselves utterly bankrupt and on the verge of homelessness. So in typical American fashion they both decide to take the easy way out and make a porno movie for some quick cash. Of course their decision leaves the viewer confused as to why they dont simply just go out and get themselves a Fing JOB instead but THAT would be a sensible solution and Americans are definitely NOT interested in THOSE. One is also left wondering why Miri doesnt just go sell one of her kidneys until one realizes the BRILLIANCE of her plan; she can only sell one of her kidneys ONCE whereas she can rent-out her vagina over and over again until its stretched-out like an old used rubber band. Ah doesnt American entrepreneurship just WARM your heart? This movie features the usual torrent of F-words and vulgar language that weve all come to expect from this particular director along with some sofisticated acting on the part of such well-known Thespians as Traci Lords who plays a prostitute that can blow bubbles with her vagina. Kinda like Alan Greenspan and Bernanke do except Tracis bubbles DONT impoverish half of humanity. Back to this flick; if youre the typical American that likes to masturbate with one hand while holding a Chicken McSandwich with the other SEE IT. If on the other hand you value quality logic intelligence and have a strong set of moral values DONT BOTHER.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 11 2008Lewis-PatrickFeaturedIn my eyes this was one of the funniest films I have ever seen.

By David Denby Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks in Kevin Smiths new movie.   Credit Illustration by Quickhoney In America no frolic of innocence can last longer than its first gathering of hollyhocks. Just two weeks ago the exuberant ""High School Musical 3"" with its Albuquerque teens bursting into song and dance opened in theatres as the latest incarnation of the old Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland musicals. Well a new revelation is at hand. Kevin Smiths comedy the foul-tongued bare-limbed ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is another twist--God help us--on those cheerful M-G-M entertainments. Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) friends since before high school and now intimate but chaste roommates are suffering through the chilly boredom of a Pittsburgh winter. Zack works in a Starbucks-like coffee shop; Miri appears to work at a mall. In any case they cant pay the bills and the power and the water have been shut off. They need some money fast and porn they reason has ""gone mainstream"" so why shouldnt they make some? Porn will turn the lights back on. Unlike the kids in the Rooney-Garland ""Babes in Arms"" they have no particular talents and only one of them is pretty to look at but for the sake of the movie they will make out in front of the camera. To complete the cast they hold auditions gathering together a ragtag group of friends and strangers along with a couple of babes in thongs from a local strip club. (Smith recruited the adult-movie pros Katie Morgan and Traci Lords for the job.) Then they start shooting befouling Zacks coffee shop after it closes its doors for the night. The movie begins with church bells ringing in mournful disapproval of the filth that is about to be set before us. Kevin Smith now thirty-eight is the potty-mouthed boy from New Jersey who established himself as an apostate with ""Dogma"" (1999) and as a chronicler of the underemployed with such comedies as ""Clerks"" (1994) ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" (2001) and ""Clerks II"" (2006). His heroes are not so much slackers (they often have jobs) as they are unambitious easily offended young men preoccupied with the small but furiously important issues of manners respect and hoped-for sex. Now that were in a recession Smiths turn toward entrepreneurial angst feels like the right idea and the lets-put-on-a-porn-show impulse is certainly promising. But I wish that Dionysus or Priapus or whatever god Smith prays to had made the movie funnier. The name of the film shot at the coffee shop is ""Swallow My Cockaccino"" which should give you some idea of the level of the movies wit. Porn of course depends on a parasitic relationship with the rest of the culture high and low and it is often close to spoof to begin with. (While taking a class on Melville forty years ago I was disconcerted to see the title ""Thar She Blows"" on a local theatre marquee.) In Smiths movie the characters compete to come up with a title for their movie based on that of a regular feature film--""American Booty"" and ""Lawrence of ALabia"" are about as good as it gets--and there is a brief fantasia in which actors dress up as characters from ""Star Whores"" but its more a costume party than an orgy. A lot of the comic ideas last for just a shot or two. When a complete sequence becomes necessary Smith makes fun of the hapless mini-scenarios of porn--the delivery man at the housewifes door the sudden urge to unzip the simulated joy. As a parodist however he doesnt have much room for maneuver; he can only make silly material sillier. Gleeful to the end he repeats his jokes over and over; some of the ideas must have been funnier to think about as minor outrages than they are to watch in a movie. His resources as a director are limited the actors stand around in awkward clumps and grope each other clumsily. Smith got an R rating (rather than an NC-17) for his movie by making it lewd but never erotic--a classic American solution to the sex-comedy problem. In the midst of the moviemaking scenes Smith attempts a love story. Zack and Miri who have huddled together as outsiders ever since they met are actually crazy about each other but cant admit it. Some of the rough affectionate banter between Rogen and Banks is well written and well delivered. I must be getting used to Rogen. When he laid hands on Katherine Heigl in ""Knocked Up"" I was seriously alarmed--the beauty-and-the beast coupling seemed a violation of the basic principles of romantic comedy. But to my amazement I thought that he and the even lovelier Elizabeth Banks made a nice couple. In only a few movies Rogen has established a persona--the underachiever the slob loser but a guy who is articulate and slightly self-disgusted and who finally pulls himself together. The flab and the soft features have become part of his junior-Falstaff appeal. He can be cast as the guy who gets the beautiful girl because underneath all his basso bluster and dirty talk hes a tender fellow. Staring in adoration at Banks near the end of the movie Rogen looks like a beatific bull. Banks had a brief role as a girl ready for anything in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and as Laura Welch in Oliver Stones ""W."" she takes a shrewd appraising look at Josh Brolins George Bush--its the films best scene. This actress--reedlike mobile but always focussed--has a real sexual spark and so beguiling a smile that she can say obscene things and still seem fresh and even classy. On the coffee-shop set Zack and Miri make love for the first time (without undressing) and discover that they respond to each other. This moment of sexual awakening is meant to be overwhelmingly romantic but since lots of people are standing around idly watching it comes off as somewhat less powerful than a Tristan-and-Isolde rapture. (I dont think were meant to believe that theyre exhibitionists.) Kevin Smith turns out to be reverent after all he wants to separate true love from mere copulating for money but his story mixes romance and porn so inextricably that he seems confused and the movie trips over its own conceits. Kristin Scott Thomass elegant bone structure and slender frame make it hard to imagine her as a coarse-grained woman (though it would be fun to see her play one). She is an actress who suggests intelligence by not giving way to obvious emotions and that taut withholding is part of her attraction--men and women too want to pull her out of her shell. At times she has hinted that something was seething underneath the beautiful mask a struggle perhaps between desire and the need to maintain her soul in isolation. As Juliette in the French film ""Ive Loved You So Long"" Scott Thomas is first seen in closeup without makeup her hair lustreless her expression blank but tense. This time shes genuinely cut off not just holding back. Juliette has recently completed a prison sentence of fifteen years for the unimaginable crime of murdering her six-year-old son. Her kid sister Lea (Elsa Zylberstein) a university professor in the city of Nancy nervously gathers her into her own family where Juliette remains in an uneasy state of semi-silence. The movie--which is the directorial debut of the novelist Philippe Claudel who also wrote the script--asks whether anyone who has done something so extreme can be welcomed back into a full human community. And does she want to be welcomed back? Scott Thomas wears a colorless print shirt and a brown skirt and she carries herself as if she were still a prisoner. She lets a man pick her up in a bar and later when he asks her if the sex was good she offers a blunt ""No not at all."" Scott Thomass bleak self-sufficiency has never been more daunting or more fascinating. ""Ive Loved You So Long"" is one of those French movies which embed their characters in a robust bourgeois culture a network of family friends and colleagues; a dailiness of cafes cigarettes and dinner parties. Difficult as Juliettes situation is Americans may be struck by how many chances she has for connection. Here emerging from prison she would likely be thrown into a much more severe and fragmented gray zone of indifference. Her sister for one ardently wants to break through to her and introduce her to people. Despite a big difference in their ages Juliette and Lea were once close and the movie is as much Leas story as it is Juliettes. Claudel turns out to be very good at the psychology of intimacy. An observant man he has assembled a large (and to us unknown) cast of actors around his star and he dramatizes her slow reawakening with an infinite number of small sharply etched details. But Claudel goes wrong in managing the nature of Juliettes crime. When you find out at the end of the movie exactly what happened long ago you feel a little cheated. But that error had the effect of making me want to see Kristin Scott Thomass performance all over again--you may need to see ""Ive Loved You So Long"" twice in order to see it once.

How horrific is it? Im far from brave but good at temporary detachment -- at the eager restoration of disbelief -- and I still had to turn away at several points. How smart is it? When the hero and heroine are having trouble setting up their camping tent in an ancient (and as it develops extremely unfriendly) forest she tells him that ""its like you always say we have to be smarter than what were working against."" This modest little genre piece is smarter than most of the overproduced and heavily marketed studio fare thats been filling the multiplexes this fall. Its short taut nicely shot well-acted astutely directed specific where it might have been generic original enough to be engrossing and derivative enough to be amusing. In other words it knows exactly where it belongs and how to be its best self. What a revolutionary concept. ENLARGE Jill Wagner Magnolia Pictures Until now the first-time director Toby Wilkins has made his name as a visual effects expert and ""Splinter"" has its share of creepy-crawlies or more precisely creepy-crawlie-slimy-spikies with emphasis on the spikes -- parasitic organisms that do grisly things to the human bodies they invade and promptly zombify. The effects range from unassuming to reasonably impressive with lots of quick cuts and flashing lights to punch them up; one effect qualifies as a hand-me-down from the 1946 horror classic ""The Beast With Five Fingers."" But Mr. Wilkins who wrote the script with Kai Barry and Ian Shorr has an equally expert way with his actors and its always the performances in these things that validate the scariness. (If a creature rises in a forest and theres no one to be horrified....) The young couple -- hes working on a doctorate in biology while her job description seems to be spunky-and-resourceful -- are played by Paulo Costanzo and Jill Wagner. They intersect with a less-affable pair an escaped con played by Shea Whigham and his hapless girlfriend played by Rachel Kerbs; theyre on the lam and en route to Mexico. Mr. Whigham whose tightly focused anger reminded me of Robert Carlyle is an impressive young actor -- though occasionally a mumbler -- who does justice to a good role a killer with a heart of silver if not quite gold. Most of the action plays out in and around a rural gas station and convenience store. Some of it is agreeably silly To foil the heat-seeking parasites the hero tries to lower his body temperature with bags of ice cubes from the store freezer then staggers around stiffly while monitoring a digital thermometer in his mouth. Jennifer Spence designed the production which was photographed by Nelson Cragg. Elia Cmiral wrote the original and judicious score and David Michael Maurer was the editor. In a time of fast-changing distribution patterns ""Splinter"" is one of an increasing number of hybrids that straddle the theater-TV divide. The film previewed Wednesday night on HDNet Movies and will be downloadable on demand via cable as well as booked in conventional theaters. It will surely find an audience. Horror fans are heat-seekers too. Zack and Miri Kevin Smiths ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" occupies the other end of the IQ scale. Its really dumb even though it starts promisingly and continues in a self-infatuated way to consider itself quite bright. Zack and Miri played by Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks are friends since high school and roommates living not only platonically but impecuniously; the lights and water have just been turned off. To avoid going completely broke they decide to yes make a porn movie. And they decide to star in it though they vow that having sex will never spoil the purity of their friendship. ENLARGE Seth Rogen as Zack and Elizabeth Banks as Miri in director Kevin Smiths Zack and Miri Make a Porno. The Weinstein Co. Thats a fine idea for the right filmmaker and the pairing of Mr. Rogen and Ms. Banks is as promising as it is preposterous. Judd Apatow certainly pulled off a gross-wins-gorgeous romance by casting Mr. Rogen opposite Katherine Heigl in ""Knocked Up."" Yet Mr. Smith the ""Clerks"" auteur and a specialist in slackers and losers slathers his patented slob esthetic indiscriminately. ""Star Whores"" the porn movie within the movie is predictably crude and nonsensical but so is the movie that surrounds it. The auditions for the porn film are thuddingly unfunny. The editing throughout is primitive -- back and forth between characters in a given scene with grindingly unvaried rhythms. The script plays like a bad treatment that tries to sell itself by explaining plot points -- including the notion that the porno cast which includes the former porn star Traci Lords is one big happy supportive family putting on a show in the spirit of an Andy Hardy comedy. And Seth Rogen is totally out of control. Hes been marvelously funny in the past and will be again but get that party animal back in his cage. DVD TIP The original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" made in 1956 by Don Siegel is a deserved horror classic. But Philip Kaufmans 1978 remake is a first-rate film in its own right. The cast includes Donald Sutherland Brooke Adams Jeff Goldblum Veronica Cartwright and Leonard Nimoy as well as Don Siegel in a cameo as a cab driver. W.D. Richter wrote the witty script.

"Zack and Miri Make a Porno Neither sexy nor funny | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentZack and Miri Make a Porno Neither sexy nor funnyIf Kevin Smith was counting on using his new movie to gain entrance to the Judd Apatow school of grossly funny flick-making hed better start dusting off his convenience-store resume.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Oct. 31 2008 (out of 4)Starring Elizabeth Banks Seth Rogen Jason Mewes Justin Long and Jeff Anderson. 102 minutes. Written and directed by Kevin Smith. At major theatres. 18A  Article Continued Below If Kevin Smith was counting on using his new movie to gain entrance to the Judd Apatow school of grossly funny flick-making hed better start dusting off his convenience-store resume.Zack and Miri Make a Porno begins with a car crash and continues with more wreckage. The biggest failure here isnt the directors almost toddler-like fascination with pooping and penises or that words referencing roosters kitty cats and female dogs are used so often you think youve wandered into an R-rated version of Dr. Doolittle.Instead it is the only truly unpardonable offence in a comedy Zack and Miri isnt very funny. Laugh-out-loud bits here are as rare as real breasts in an adult film and worse Smith figures if you repeat offensive things they will magically become knee-slappers. He beats Dobbin so mercilessly all thats left is a bottle of glue and a can of Alpo.Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have been best pals since grade school. Now strictly platonic roommates Miri is underemployed and slacker Zack works at the local Starbucks clone in their Pennsylvania hometown. Theyre broke (Zack spent their last few bucks on an online sex-toy flashlight purchase - isnt that hilarious?) and its the cold heart of winter. First the water is shut off then the lights and heat. Eviction looms.Their 10-year high school reunion leads to inspiration for a way to increase their cash flow inspired by a brush with a diminutive gay porn star with a Jolly Green Giant voice (Mac ad spokesguy Justin Long whose character is the movies comic high point). Hes hooked up with the class stud (Supermans Brandon Routh). If this guy can make a mint doing it in ""all-male casts"" in front of the cameras why cant Zack and Miri? Theyll make a homegrown adult flick and sell enough copies online to pay off their debts. But they dont figure one thing into the equation that their hearts may somehow get in on the action once they have sex in front of the camera.All of Smiths greatest hits are here hockey Star Wars filth and philosophy and one incredibly bad-taste scene that will get the entire theatre squirming as audiences fight to keep their popcorn and nachos down. Added to the Smith mix is Apatows signature male fantasy (think Knocked Up) the flabby unappealing slob miraculously hooks up with a stunning gal who wouldnt look at him twice in the real world.There seems to be no end to the humiliation Smith is willing to heap on his female stars especially Bankss Miri. Zack repeatedly walks in on her while shes sitting on the toilet. A peeping Tom cellphone-camera video of her changing displaying a pair of gargantuan underpants goes viral on the Web. Yet Banks the most talented actor on the Zack and Miri set keeps her characters charm and wit intact.The pair hire actors for their porn flick (cue the first montage) funded by Zacks deadpan co-worker The Offices Craig Robinson. They end up with real-life adult film stars Traci Lords and Katie Morgan. The big surprise is Morgan who shows a natural flair for comedy.Smith stalwarts Jason Mewes (Jay from Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) as an enthusiastic copulator and Jeff Anderson (Clerks Dogma) as the cameraman keep things familiar.Theres plenty of simulated sex some full-frontal nudity (none from Banks and mercifully only a bare bum chest and bouncing belly from Rogen) and raunchy exploration of every bodily function and sexual practice you can think of and perhaps a few you havent. When Zack and Miri veer into the romantic things get even harder to stomach. We know Smith can do smart romance - Chasing Amy still delights and even Jersey Girl had its moments amid the sentimental goo. But this romance feels as fake as porn star Morgans spectacularly enhanced chest. The best scenes in Zack and Miri come well into the closing credits something locals may miss in the typical Toronto dash for the door a two-minute denouement that nicely fleshes out the porno plot and gives some credibility to how these two ended up sharing more than a keg and a party-size pizza.Read Linda Barnards interview with Elizabeth Banks at the Toronto International Film Festival at thestar.com/movies and click on TIFF profiles.

Seth Rogen left and Elizabeth Banks are shown in a scene from ""Zack amp; Miri Make A Porno."" Photo Darren Michaels The Weinstein Co. Movie review Zack and Miri Make a Porno 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Zack and Miri Make a PornoComedy. Starring Seth Rogen Elizabeth Banks Jason Mewes and Traci Lords. Directed by Kevin Smith. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The ""Tropic Thunder"" Robert Downey Jr.-plays-a-black-guy outrage remains the lamest movie-related controversy of the year but not by much. Several newspapers and an entire city (Philadelphia of all places) have refused to carry advertisements for ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" because of the last word in the title. Never mind that naked pictures of ""High School Musical"" star Vanessa Hudgens are easy to find on the Internet and that a TV station in New Jersey recently showed real porn when it was supposed to be airing an episode of ""Handy Manny."" Some child could see the word porno on a billboard and what - their eyeballs might burst into flames? The makers of ""Zack and Miri"" fight back the only way they can under these circumstances They make a movie thats hilarious. The dialogue and plot turns often stretch the boundaries of political correctness. (If you dont watch porn to begin with you probably shouldnt see the movie.) But along with the awkward romantic exchanges that always seem to find their way into Smiths movies theres also a sweetness that you dont often see in films that average multiple f-words per minute. ""Zack and Miri"" has some Smith regulars in it and his raunchy-yet-clever dialogue is instantly recognizable. But he wisely leaves the safety zone of his View Askewniverse which is marked by Smiths Jay and Silent Bob characters a home base of New Jersey and vaguely autobiographical story lines. The main characters in the new film live in Pittsburgh are in their 20s and have maybe 10 percent less ambition than the characters in ""Clerks."" Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are platonic roommates who are scratching and surviving stumbling each morning to going-nowhere jobs even as their 10th high school reunion approaches. When their apartments water and power get turned off for nonpayment they consider starring in a self-produced porno - and the intimacy that results forces them to examine their relationship. ""Zack and Miri"" falters during the rare moments when things get serious and a ""Threes Company""-caliber misunderstanding that causes the conflict in the movies second half is pretty weak. This is also the type of movie that works less the more you think about it. How can two single employed people with no kids sharing a rental in Pittsburgh not be flush with cash? Why do the alumni at Zack and Miris 10-year reunion seem to range in age from 23 to 45? And how do all these schlubby and broke characters played by Seth Rogen continue to score Hollywoods hottest blondes? But the funny parts are what youll remember from the jokes about defiling drinks in a Peets-like coffeehouse to the knowing satire of the porn industry. (Zack and Miris attempts to name their film is one of the better running jokes.) The audience where I watched the movie laughed so hard that we all probably missed a third of the lines and it was still one of the funnier movies Ive seen this year. Rogen is steady once again doing his young Albert Brooks thing and Justin Long and Brandon Routh contribute memorable cameos but Banks is the standout cast member showing that she can add another dimension to her fun and naughty character from ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" One of Smiths less-appreciated talents is the ability to craft characters that act obnoxiously but are still sort of lovable despite their faults. Jason Mewes plays a borderline deranged D-list porn actor and you still want good things to happen to him. One more small thing Fans of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" will love the frequent nods to that film including Zacks hockey teams name (the Monroeville Zombies) and a guest appearance by ""Dawn"" actor Tom Savini. Parents thought that George A. Romero film was bad for kids too. And yet look how many entertaining filmmakers it influenced. -- Advisory Its called ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" not ""Zack and Miri Make a Family Comedy"" or ""Zack and Miri Make a Christian Film Starring Kirk Cameron."" Adjust your expectations accordingly. (This film contains strong sexual content graphic nudity and a near-constant stream of profanity.)

Zack and Miri Make a Porno (R) The Weinstein Company (101 min.) Directed by Kevin Smith. With Seth Rogen Elizabeth Banks. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS Long-time platonic friends Zack and Miri have crummy jobs a dirty apartment on which they are months behind on the rent a vast array of unpaid bills and absolutely no prospects. So how are two relatively unskilled people going to make some money in a hurry? If in doubt please refer back to the movies title. Its Zacks idea of course and Miri remains unconvinced. If its so easy to make a porn film then why doesnt everybody make one when they have bills to pay? ""Because other people have options"" he explains. ""And dignity."" Hes got that right. These characters have no dignity -- and neither does their film. Instead it has full-frontal nudity copious sex jokes inventively filthy dialogue the obligatory ""Star Wars"" references and a truly cringe-worthy diarrhea scene. It is in other words a film by Kevin Smith. And in many ways its nice to have the dirty boy back. The comedy genre he pioneered more than a decade ago with ""Clerks"" -- a schlub and his friends stand around talking endless pop-culture nonsense while dreaming of women way out of their league -- has since been co-opted by Hollywood farce factory Judd Apatow. Its about time the archetypal Jersey Guy reclaimed it. Except that Smith now lives in Hollywood. And while there are some familiar View Askew faces in this film (Jason Mewes Jeff Anderson) it also ironically stars Apatows signature star Seth Rogen (and co-stars Craig Robinson from the Apatow-produced ""Pineapple Express""). Theyre both fine -- Robinson may be the funniest thing in the film -- but its a little odd seeing them in this context and even a little forced. For diehard Smith fans theres stuff to like. The plot -- which has Zack making his movie after hours in the store where he holds down a minimum wage job -- mirrors Smiths beginnings making ""Clerks"" in a convenience store in Leonardo. There are a number of in-jokes and a real romance in which Zack and Miri only discover how much they love each other after they make love for money. And yet that doesnt quite add up to a movie. Part of the problem is that theres no backstory to these characters -- two relatively smart (and in Miris case very personable) people who at 28 are still working dead-end jobs and living one step away from homelessness. What have they been doing for the last decade? How have they managed to drift so aimlessly and for so long? The other problem is the casting. Smith for all his dirty jokes is a genuine romantic -- but his two genuine romances ""Jersey Girl"" and ""Chasing Amy"" starred Ben Affleck. And while Affleck may be unfairly now damaged goods in Hollywood at least hes still a leading man; Rogen is an amiable clown. He looks like a Care Bear on a bender and its pretty difficult to imagine a woman who looks like Elizabeth Banks pining after him for a decade. And if we cant believe that Miri could be desperately in love with Zack -- well then the dramatic situation of them making a porn film with other people has no weight at all. Smith has put some thought and work into this. Yet nothing in this dialogue is anywhere nearly as dirty as the verbiage of the first ""Clerks"" (or as genuinely provocative as the debates in ""Dogma""). And for all the skin on display nothing is quite as sexy as that unexpected moment in ""Clerks II"" when Brian OHalloran held Rosario Dawsons foot and lovingly painted her toenails. There are plenty of dirty jokes here and even a few nicely staged scenes -- a big step forward for a director who used to merely set up his tripod and let two characters yammer. But the mood lurches around a bit and the film itself feels a bit diluted -- as if Kevin Smith were doing Judd Apatow doing Kevin Smith. And Smith and his fans are far too original to settle for that for long. Rating note The film contains full-frontal nudity sexual situations and strong language.

(Darren Michaels) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 30 2008 427 PM No one could argue that Kevin Smith is one of the funniest filmmakers weve got. Its just that his talents dont always translate to the big screen.Smith can be downright brilliant in person on his Web site and even on TV (see his pilot for ""Reaper"" the best show youve never seen). But when it comes to movies he cant help giving in to his baser instincts. RELATED ELIZABETH BANKS GOES FROM ""W"" TO ""X""I have nothing against the cheerfully crude nature of ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" Before Judd Apatow before ""South Park"" even before the Farrelly brothers it was Smiths ""Clerks"" that exposed the delirious potential of shock value.But without the wit raunchiness tends to feel uncomfortably forced. And the moments when ""Zamp;M"" works are almost without exception the ones that are more sweet than shocking. All the rest frankly feel like Apatow Lite.RELATED PORNO"" BILLBOARDS TOO TITILLATINGIn the grand Apatowian tradition of the gorgeous woman who falls for the schlubby guy Elizabeth Banks is Miri and Seth Rogen is Zack. Platonic roommates facing a mountain of bills they decide their best chance at fast cash is the one in the title.So they round up a couple of strippers (adult stars Traci Lords and Katie Morgan) and some eager backup (including Jason Mewes and Craig Robinson) and devise their concept a sci-fi takeoff called ""Star Whores."" The complications set in when Zack and Miri decide they wont just write and direct. Theyll also co-star. PHOTOS FALL ADULT ENTERTAINMENTThere are some genuine laughs and Banks and Rogen do have an easy chemistry. Smith also puts enough heart into the script that we actually believe the moment their feelings change for each other despite the fact that it happens while theyre having sex on camera as the whole crew watches. (Yes it really is that kind of movie. And Banks incidentally is the only one who never violates any nudity clause.)But while the newly enamored pair are able to ignore all the surrounding distractions you may not be quite as successful. Rogen is certainly at his most appealing when he tries to profess his undying love. And if you think its absolutely hilarious that he does it while Miris using the bathroom this is your kind of romance. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks play two broke roommates who attempt to make a skin flick to pay their bills in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Photo DARREN MICHAELS ASSOCIATED PRESS | THE WEINSTEIN CO. Zack and Miri Make a Porno 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SO. Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Snore. Im sorry. Did I begin to nod off there? Mea culpa. Here I am watching this highly graphic comedy about two highly cash-strapped friends making a highly X-rated movie about baristas-gone-wild in a coffee shop and Im finding it highly difficult to care. Because despite all the waggish raunch-talk its just not especially funny. And despite all the agile intercourse (originally rated NC-17) its frankly kind of a bore. Thats a recurrent problem with movies about the sex act. Not movies that feature the sex act; Im thinking of theatrical films that aim to expose celebrate or even radicalize (as in Crash) the raw truth of sexual activity only to suck all apparent joy from its pursuit. Nothing makes sex less interesting than a blah film about sex. Yet Im certain writer-director Kevin Smith (Clerks II) isnt trying to depersonalize or politicize the reproductive act in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. His purpose is quite the opposite To show us that it matters. That it means something. When longtime platonic roommates Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) set out to make a skin flick (their first attempt Star Whores) the aim isnt to objectify each other. All they want is to pay their utility bills. To turn on the heat they must turn up the heat. The inspiration for this awesome new moneymaking scheme comes from Zack and Miris 10th high school reunion where Miri tries to seduce an old crush (Superman Returns Brandon Routh) while Zack makes small talk with the guys porn-star boyfriend (Justin Long the Mac in those Apple ads). Quicker than you can say ""Hey kids Lets put on a show"" Zack and Miri are striking out as homegrown pornographers -- first in a scuzzy warehouse later in the Starbucks-y franchise where Zack barely works. They cast parts in every sense. They make imaginative use of dairy products. They collaborate with a motley crew that includes a few Smith habitues (Jason Mewes Jeff Anderson) the filmmakers wife (Jennifer Schwalbach) and a couple of real-life porn stars (Traci Lords and Katie Morgan). And they map out who humps whom for the cameras -- including Zack and Miri who dont want to endanger their friendship but dont want to chicken out either. Each hopes the other wont mistake doing the nasty for anything more complicated. ""I dont want you getting all mushy and gooey on me"" Zack warns Miri. Mush? Goo? In a porno? You see their problem. And you see Smiths. From the start hes built his reputation and his fanbase (me included) with coarsely loquacious diatribes on pop life and the modern American libido. But hes also Catholic -- and if you can get past the the language the gonads and all those yakkety Star Wars disquisitions youll find the probing mind of a devout if somewhat ornery believer. A moralist even. A mush. So theres no particular shock when Zack and Miri takes an abrupt turn toward sentimentality. But he cant have it both ways. If he wants us to believe in true love he cant simultaneously exploit the dehumanized flesh and grinding mechanics of the porn industry -- not without making the love seem false and the sex seem icky. The cognitive dissonance is way past tolerable even in a movie starring my favorite fuzzy man-boy Rogen. Hes played unlikely swains before (see Knocked Up and other Judd Apatow output) and he brings a comfy good will to the filthiest dialogue. But even he cant save this fumbling movie from its own confused desires. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot ThinkGeek Summer Clearance Sale Up to 65% off + free shipping...

"Porno for tyros - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie review A bawdy funny Porno for tyros Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks star in Kevin Smiths latest. (Darren Michaels/The Weinstein Company) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / October 31 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Its just possible that Kevin Smith has found a way to beat the economic recession and the energy crisis at the same time. Regardless of which candidate takes next weeks election this soft-centered down-and-dirty comedy foresees an era of mom-and-pop pornography that could well erase the national debt and lift the national libido. At the least well stay warm through the winter.Rudely silly rather than transgressively shocking ""Zack and Miri"" is the sort of bawdy but fundamentally decent farce you could take Grandma to provided Grandma were familiar with the oeuvre of Traci Lords. Seth Rogen on loan from the Judd Apatow universe and Elizabeth Banks (last seen playing Laura Bush in ""W."") are longtime best friends roommates and losers living in the Pittsburgh area. Times are tight and Zacks job as a surly barista isnt cutting it. When the water and electricity are shut off desperate measures are called for.Mickey and Judy would have put on a show in a barn. Smith the strip-mall Preston Sturges responsible for ""Clerks"" ""Dogma"" and ""Chasing Amy"" understands that porn has become the great American leveler - an Internet-fueled democracy of basic animal urges open to any entrepreneur with a digital camera. So Zack writes a script (this being Smith its initially a series of obscene variations on ""Star Wars"") finds a cast and crew (this being Smith longtime companions Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson turn up; so does Apatow semi-regular Craig Robinson) and starts rolling.The jokes in the first half of ""Zack and Miri"" are raucous and liberating riffing on the notion that sexual stallions and bubbleheaded vixens are just out there waiting for that one Craigslist ad that would allow them to hop off their Facebook pages and onto the screen. Mewess character is a priapic Joe Average who walks in and is ready to go. Lords herself shows up as a local sex worker; this is a little like enlisting Whitey Bulger for a supporting role in ""The Departed.""If you go in expecting explicit body parts and illegal acts youll be disappointed; Smith wants his R rating intact. More to the point hed rather laugh at the absurdity of people making a sex film when they should just be having sex. For all their teasing camaraderie Zack and Miri are drearily uptight about each other; the most outrageous laughs come in an early high school reunion scene when the class dreamboat (Brandon Routh of ""Superman Returns"") brings his husband a gay porn star played with all stops out by Justin Long. The real gag of ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" though is that making a porno is work not sex. Zack discovers to his surprise that hes a pretty good producer and as his confidence grows so does his certainty that he doesnt want anybody ""acting"" with Miri except himself. Rogens face is an unmade bed of sexual and romantic frustration.Banks as a particular kind of small-town potty-mouth beauty matches Rogen stride for stride but both actors seem confused when ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" decides to become an conventional romance in the home stretch. Smith makes the smart point that real lovemaking looks nothing like the aerobic Iron Man contests of porn and he knows why too Other peoples emotional intimacy can be downright embarrassing. Here sadly its also boring.If Smiths mushy stuff felt half as fresh as his knack for intelligent crudeness ""Zack and Miri"" might be one of the better movies of the year and certainly the most scurrilous. The irony is that with a title as good as this one he went ahead and made a Mickey and Judy movie anyway.

High concepts often yield low results. A case in point Kevin Smiths ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" in which Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks play platonic roomies who decide to make an adult film in order to pay the rent. Youll be shocked - shocked - to discover that they actually love each other. The adult film reenactments are fairly gross and explicit and worse humorless. Rogen usually seen in Judd Apatow movies overdoes the scuzzball charm; Banks looks alternately titillated and embarrassed for herself.

The naked truth Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks are broke so they make an adult film to get money. ABOUT THE MOVIE Zack and Miri Make a Porno  (out of four)Stars Seth Rogen Elizabeth Banks Jason Mewes Traci Lords Craig RobinsonDirector Kevin SmithDistributor The Weinstein Co. Rating R for strong crude sexual content including dialogue graphic nudity and pervasive languageRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE VIDEO By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Zack and Miri Make a Porno longs to be a smutty film with a heart of gold. Instead its a funny concept whose execution does not live up to its potential. Roommates and longtime best friends Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are broke and struggling. They cant make the rent and the electricity has been shut off. At their high school reunion Zack has an unexpected conversation with Brandon (Justin Long) the porn-star boyfriend of their former classmate Bobby (Brandon Routh). Their exchange (one of the movies humorous highlights) leads to a crazy idea that just might work. Bankrolled by a pal Zack and Miri decide to make an adult film hoping for a big payoff. Director Kevin Smith seems to be trying to take his signature slacker-chatty style in the Judd Apatow direction. But he doesnt have the finesse to pull it off as skillfully as Apatow and company can. Despite the attention-getting title the movie does not seem particularly titillating -- just tired and mired in gross-out humor. The gags feel familiar. A full-frontal scene by Lester (Jason Mewes a Kevin Smith regular) is reminiscent of Jason Segels scene in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Miris ""granny panties"" extended joke simply updates a Bridget Jones gag for a more tech-savvy audience. One scatological scene is sure to induce audible groans. Gross-out humor in movies is getting more vulgar and off-putting ostensibly to stand out from all the similar jokes that went before. Do filmmakers really think that propels the art form forward? Or do they assume its that tough to amuse audiences jaded and inured by increasingly risque gags? Rogen and Banks make a good comic pair. But the notion that they fall in love while making a clumsy porn film -- or realize theyve been in love for a while -- seems oddly sentimental and conventional in what is meant to be an offbeat raunchy comedy. Smith has always had a penchant for scenes featuring raw discussion of sex (Chasing Amy) and Porno takes that predilection even further. But the love story turns out to be as generic as Nights in Rodanthe. Though Rogen and Banks have some chemistry Rogen is playing a very familiar character bordering on overexposure. Is he the only go-to guy for schlumpy twentysomething romantic leads? Zack and Miri leaves us wondering whether its supposed to be mostly a touching love story or a crude comic romp. Certainly theres room for sweetness amid bawdy humor but the fusion should be somewhat original or at least believable. In trying to meld the two it doesnt succeed at either. It may be too sickly-sweet for audiences drawn to the idea of a ribald comedy and too explicit and foul-mouthed for those who prefer their love stories to be romantic.

Best buds since elementary school they share a wry sense of humor and apathetic love resumes. Now 30ish aimless and platonically sharing a crummy apartment they work at McJobs that barely keep the utilities paid. Well not always. When the water and electricity are shut off for nonpayment Zack a shambling teddy bear convinces skeptical Miri that making a homebrewed adult video would solve their financial problems. When the old friends decide to have on-camera sex however new difficulties arise. You know feelings It was just a matter of time until Seth Rogen graduated from Judd Apatows tender/raunchy romcoms to a Kevin Smith project. Smith the slacker auteur of ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy"" is Apatows aesthetic kin. They share a dirty-minded humanism which is exactly the soil Rogen requires for his talent to flower. He radiates an I-dare-you wickedness; his every leer is a troublemaking come-on. As Zack he doesnt exactly push the boundaries of his abilities. Rather hes so comfortable and silly and cute that you relax into the idea that he could 1) persuade scrumptious Elizabeth Banks to hook up with him and 2) do it on camera. Banks (currently doing a note-perfect Laura Bush in Oliver Stones ""W."") makes Miri a great sport and a game gal. When she digests Zacks porno proposition and agrees to help him produce the movie we suspect that she has some subterranean longings for the big lug. Pulling together the cast and crew is a comedy of errors. Miri and Zack audition their would-be skin stars with a winning mix of pragmatism and kindness. The ""actors"" including daredevil Lester (Jason Mewes the recurring character of loudmouth ""Jay"" in most of Smiths films) and the exceptionally capable Bubbles (adult film star Traci Lords) become a surrogate family for the couple. Together they guide Zack and Miri through the realization that theyre falling in love. Once they overcome the contrived misunderstanding that keeps them apart until the finale they cease being personal and professional failures and achieve an X-rated version of the American Dream. Its a pleasant story but not particularly well-told. Its puzzling that Smith hasnt matured as a filmmaker. Eight films into his career hes still a scrappy amateur while his contemporary Paul Thomas Anderson has grown from an indie upstart to a major talent. Its doubtful that Smith will ever make a ""Boogie Nights"" or ""Magnolia"" or ""There Will Be Blood."" At 38 he has just about exhausted the ""lovable schlub"" act. You leave ""Zack and Miri"" pleased that the couple have grown up a little and impatient for Smith to follow suit. ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong crude sexual content including dialogue graphic nudity and pervasive language.

Confectionarily speaking its an obscenity-glazed sour patch with a toothache-sweet caramel center.Zach (cuddly Seth Rogen) and Miri (bubbly Elizabeth Banks) are Pittsburgh rowdies and roommates on the striving end of retail. Hes a barista shes a mall cashier and theyre delinquent on the utility bills for their forlorn Pittsburgh flat. During a frigid Steeltown winter theyre in hot water - and freezing cold.At their 10th high school reunion Miri hopes to hook up with with her sophomore crush Bobby Long (Brandon Routh). There she learns that not only does he play for the other team hes the prince of gay porn. Highly strung as a show poodle Justin Long portrays Bobbys domestic partner in the films slyest performance.Stone-cold broke not to mention stone cold Zach and Miri think that porn may be the answer to their money woes. They enlist Zacks colleague Delaney (Craig Robinson very deadpan and very funny) to ""produce"" the effort.Smith is a genuinely funny writer - Judd Apatow gives him props for ""laying the tracks"" that have made possible those Apatow freight trains The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. If you can stomach the pot-and-potty humor (I couldnt) there are laughs to be had.By the halfway mark Rogens performance like his voice is less cuddly than grating and the carbonated giggle that is Elizabeth Banks grows flat.This ones for the Smith cultists. Zack and Miri Make a Porno  (out of four stars) Written and directed by Kevin Smith. With Seth Rogen Elizabeth Banks Craig Robinson Brandon Routh and Justin Long.

"Movie review Zack and Miri Make a Porno -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Zack and Miri Make a Porno -- 2 out of 5 stars Lifelong friends and roommates Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are facing hard times and a mountain of debt when they seize upon the idea of making a porno movie for some quick cash. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The ""it"" boy of crude comedy Seth Rogen loses some of his comic heat when he teams up with the guy who invented the genre Kevin Smith in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Its a raunchy R-rated farce (appealed from an NC-17) in the standard Smith style -- comical sex talk with the women just as dirty as the guys dated pop culture references a big gross-out moment and an endless litany of oral sex jokes.But its a slow-footed film that confirms that Smith may never be able to lift his game to that 40 Year Old Virgin level of heart and romance. Hes just too juvenile to pull it off. Art imitates porn in this dully shot and edited comedy about a couple of desperate platonic roommates (Rogen and Elizabeth Banks) who decide to do a cheap porno together to make the rent. When Zack jokes that their high school classmates are one target audience and doing a spoof of Star Wars will give them another hes breaking down Smiths marketing scheme. Put ""porno"" in the title and Star Wars in the plot and the Smithheads will come.Zack cons a colleague from the coffee shop where he works (Craig Robinson of Pineapple Express) to put up the money. And he sweet-talks the too-hot-but-still-single roomie into being his co-star. ""Miriam Linkey will you have sex with me on camera?""They cast the picture giving roles to Bubbles (porn actress Traci Lords showing some mileage) and Lester (Smiths pal Jason Mewes looking like death). A hockey pal of Zacks (Jeff Anderson another Smith mainstay) will run camera.Disasters that befall a lower-than-low-budget ""film"" hit them. But they improvise adjust and its lights camera copulation Other crude couplings are just time-killers until the main event Zack and Miris big scene. Since theyve been friends since first grade that promises to be awkward if they ever get around to it.Banks is the heart of this and if there are any ""feelings"" that get in the way of Zack and Miris porn plans she makes them believable. But as with every Rogen leading lady you could scratch your head bald puzzling over what she could possibly see in him. Miri is clumsy making bad life and career choices. And Zack? Hes so thinly written that hes basically a plot device. Justin Long improvises a frat boys idea of a gay porn star and amuses. A loud profane Tisha Martin Campbells rant near the finale is the funniest scene in the movie.The aging Smith film vets in the cast remind us that Smith and Co. are older and that like the Dumb amp; Dumber Farrelly Brothers Smith has lost his fastball and is scrambling to adjust to life in the post- Judd Apatow comedy universe. But its not enough to simply steal Apatow actors (Rogen Banks and Robinson). Zack and Miri Make a Porno is just the aging dead-end kids from Clerks finally getting the gumption to go out and do something with their dirty limited little minds -- and videotape it.

Well almost. Its not just a wink-and-a-nod title. They make an adult film albeit in an R-rated movie (it originally earned an NC-17). And although nothing is nearly as explicit as it would be in a ""real"" pornographic film (or so weve heard) theres a plentiful amount of nudity sex talk obscene language - and laughs. Director Kevin Smith as anyone who has memorized the choice lines from his films Clerks and Chasing Amy knows isnt one to back away from controversial material. He courts it here but with a different goal Hes using porno movies to mask his real purpose - the making of a sweet romantic comedy. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks star as the title characters platonic housemates and lifelong best friends who are so broke their water and power is cut off. An unlikely sequence of events - the lack of money a high-school reunion where they meet a gay porn star (a fall-down-funny Justin Long) and an initially unwanted accidental appearance on YouTube - leads them to what suddenly seems so obvious Lets put on a show A porn show With explicit sex With each other (Among others) Zack shows an unexpected ambitious streak as he pulls together a motley crew for the movie with the working title Star Whores. His cast includes Bubbles (former porn star Traci Lords) - and yes the name has meaning; Stacey (current porn star Katie Morgan); and Lester (Jason Mewes) among others. All have unusual talents and interests you might say. Zack recruits co-worker Delaney (Craig Robinson) to shell out money a perk that includes helping with casting. His pal Deacon (Jeff Anderson) serves as cameraman. The setup is funny sometimes hilarious although a healthy appreciation for foul-mouthed humor is a requirement. But everything leads up to of course a scene between Zack and Miri. Will it change how they feel about each other? The answer is as obvious as it is in any romantic comedy. The difference is in the X-rated details. In that regard Smith has created something wholly new here (if something no one was asking for particularly). The world of homemade porn has exploded; because of better technology anyone can make an adult film. Its a world ripe with comic potential as any endeavor by amateurs is and Smith mines it well. Its the romantic-comedy side of Zack and Miri thats utterly predictable. But clothed in porn trappings so to speak its seems fresher than it might have been. Rogen seems born to this kind of thing but Banks is also game in a gleefully profane way. Robinson who appears in several Judd Apatow films is familiar with the territory. Hes funny as well. Zack and Miri ends up as an interesting hybrid a sweet feel-good comedy that makes you feel like you need a shower after youve watched it. Progress? Of a sort perhaps and awfully funny besides.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 30 2008 1228 PM Yuck Zack and Miri Make a Porno will make you never want to have sex again. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Zack and Miri Make a Porno click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Elizabeth Banks and Seth Rogen in Zack and Miri Make a Porno By the standards of post-Apatovian gross-out comedy the plot of Zack and Miri Make a Porno (The Weinstein Company)--two broke platonic pals agree to collaborate on a homemade porn film and fall in love in the process--qualifies as positively sweet. This movie could have been an effervescent neo-screwball romance Bringing Up Baby with nut-sack jokes. So theres no blaming the subject matter for the fact that Zack and Miri feels so dispiritingly graceless. The cast isnt really at fault either. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks though their chemistry is a little off here proved they can have good on-screen sex in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and the very funny Craig Robinson (who like Rogen is a regular Apatow player) nearly commits Grand Theft Movie in every role he plays. Nope Im afraid theres no one to blame but writer-director Kevin Smith if viewers walk out of Zack and Miri never wanting to have sex again. A cult figure among the Adult Swim crowd Smith has always been better at the foulmouthed and frankly sophomoric (Clerks Mallrats) than the wistful and sincere (Chasing Amy Jersey Girl). This movie ups the ante in both categories; it wants its audience to guffaw at dick jokes and swoon over the perfect kiss. That combination of raunch and heart isnt impossible to achieve--at his best Apatow can pull it off--but it requires a nimbler pen and a sweeter soul than Kevin Smith brings to this movie. Zack (Rogen) and Miri (Banks) play unambitious and barely solvent twentysomethings who share a squalid apartment in Pittsburgh. He works as a barista in a strip-mall coffee shop; she sells clothes at the mall. As their unpaid bills pile up and eviction notices loom Zack hatches a plan to cash in with a homemade adult video--a plan Miri resists until their power and water are shut off on the same day. Advertisement After securing seed money from Zacks co-worker Delaney (Robinson) the roomies hire a cast of willing exhibitionists (including Kevin Smith stalwart Jason Mewes and real-life porn stars Traci Lords and Katie Morgan) and rent a studio space in which to shoot their outer-space sex opera Star Whores. After a last-minute setback the crew is forced to reshoot at Zack and Delaneys coffee shop after hours where they decide to jettison the George Lucas angle and title their new masterwork Swallow My Cockuccino. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The movies central joke--that loving intimate sex of the kind Zack and Miri will eventually have on camera makes for lousy pornography--is both clever and affecting. And the scene in which the two friends finally get it on is one of the few aesthetically successful moments as Smith uses two different soundtracks to contrast the lovers ecstasy with their onlookers boredom. But Zack and Miri keeps throwing away the opportunity to be more than a string of undifferentiated puerile gags. The moment these characters start discussing feelings their dialogue turns stiff Would anyone from Zack and Miris uninhibited Generation Y circle be caught dead using the boomer euphemism ""making love""? Boogie Nights (one of my favorite films of the 90s) and the 2003 Spanish gem Torremolinos 73were both delightful (if idealized) fantasies about porn-making as a source of personal and artistic liberation. But though Zack and Miri staunchly maintains that its characters find creative fulfillment in their group project we never really see them experiencing that joy. Maybe thats because Zack and Miri and their crew are barely characters at all; theyre wisecrack delivery systems. As for the porn itself what sex we do see is simulated; the nudity is minimal (the inflated breasts of porn stars seem more like costumes than body parts) and theres a single albeit deeply disgusting scatological sight gag. Zack and MiriMake a Porno is neither dirty enough to satisfy Kevin Smith fans nor romantic enough to get your date into bed. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

The platonic duo friends...2008-10-31Traci LordsThe Weinstein Company Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Darren Michaels) C- Zack and Miri Make a Porno Genre Comedy Drama; Starring Elizabeth Banks Seth Rogen Traci Lords; Director Kevin Smith; Author Kevin Smith; Release Date Wide 10/31/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 101; MPAA Rating R; Distributor The Weinstein Company Posted October 31 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT Technically Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) do make a porno in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. The platonic duo friends since high school and now housemates with the sort of bad credit rating and depressed ambitions weve come to expect from the yakety slackers in many Kevin Smith comedies put out a casting call for people willing to perform sex on camera. The Zack-and-Miri version of thinking big? Maybe homemade porn will pay the bills. (Zack the java monkeys minimum-wage job at a Starbucks knockoff would make presidential candidates weep with election-season empathy.) The pair even volunteer their own services willing to ""do"" sex on screen if thats what it takes to get the electricity turned back on. Of course what Zack and Miri actually make -- and what Rogen and Banks power their way through with a cherubic energy above and beyond the call of duty for a premise so inconsequential and puerile -- is another Kevin Smith comedy. And what the amateur filmmakers recapitulate in the porno embedded within Zack and Miri Make a Porno is the usual stuff of that proud son of New Jerseys repertory only with more giggling over boob jokes gay jokes mall jokes panty jokes and high-school-back-in-the-day jokes. A Smith production is always noisy shambling and liberally smutty on the outside while conservatively gooey on the inside (and always proudly a visual eyesore as if compositional coherence signifies selling out to the Man). This iteration climaxing with the making of the porno movie within the movie is all of the above with Smith on?okay not steroids but maybe a Venti Frappuccino half skim with foam. And ogling boobies. The sex talk is dirty and silly; the sex action in porn scenes while ostensibly dirty (with the exaggerated assets of former porn actress?turned?winking parody of a porn actress Traci Lords fully bared) is even sillier; and the 10th high school reunion that Zack and Miri decide to attend just to assure themselves that ""even though were broke and didnt amount to anything...were better than these people"" is a thicket of scores to be settled for past snubs that still sting. The simplistic message however is one any church pastor might give Sex isn?t sexy without love commitment and fidelity. The established auteur who made Clerks (un and deux) Mallrats and Chasing Amy may now be a 38-year-old husband and father who heads a successful production company but hes still got cheap advice for schlumpy twentysomething guys like Zack. (Zacks notion of getting lucky at the reunion FYI is receiving a quicky handjob from a bitter married classmate whos enraged because her husband is flirting across the crowded room.) The advice Find someone as luscious and amazingly available as Banks Miri and the electricity will magically switch on by itself. Well duh. Of course Zack and Miri are meant for each other -- why else cast that huggable Fozzie Bear Rogen or the delectable Banks who lets face it looks like the Girl Least Likely to End Up a Loser? When Zack and Miri do finally get it on -- an intimate scene that even bad cinematography can?t ruin -- their lovemaking though strategically covered up is the one naked moment of emotion (and yes eroticism) in this otherwise coarse movies whole tired simulated premise. And still Smith throws in a limp third act before the dunderheads can admit their obvious lurrrve. Besides Rogen and Banks the cast is a scroungy mix of Smith regulars (including Jeff Anderson and muse Jason Mewes) porn pros (including Lords and Katie Morgan) and new ensemble additions including Craig Robinson (he plays Darryl on The Office) as a married pal pining to see some new breasts and thus willing to underwrite the porno production costs if he can be in on the casting sessions. (Robinsons character is dedicated to the proposition that the word titties is endlessly hilarious. Endlessly.) Oh and its worth mentioning the cameo skit at the 10th reunion between two recognizable handsome male actors whose names you may read elsewhere but not in this spoiler-free zone The big guffaw is that one of the pop cuties plays a gay porn star and the other plays his boyfriend who was once a crush of Miris. The whole joke is so very...one decade out of date. C? Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"Zack and Miri Make a Porno | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; zack-and-miri-make-a-porno ) Zack and Miri Make a Porno (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli An interesting synergy exists between Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith. With films like Clerks Mallrats and Chasing Amy Smith opened a door that about 10 years later Apatow walked through. Now with Zack and Miri Make a Porno Smith has fully and unabashedly followed Apatow back into this territory that he once owned completing the circle. In fact so many Apatow signatures can be found in this film that it makes one appreciate how much these two have in common. Theres the full-frontal male nudity the romantic comedy subtext and (perhaps most tellingly) the participation of Elizabeth Banks (who played the vixen in The 40-Year-Old Virgin) and Seth Rogen one of Apatows best pals. Zack and Miri Make a Porno transpires in western Pennsylvania instead of New Jersey where many of Smiths other films have been set. The title characters platonic best friends since first grade are facing a financial crisis. They are in danger of losing the apartment they share because they cant pay the rent. The electricity and water have already been disconnected. Zack (Rogen) has a brainstorm he and Miri (Banks) can make an amateur porn film that if reasonably successful would allow them to clear their debts. Of course this will force them to cross a line they have never traversed during their relationship but after all sex is just sex - isnt it? Joining the porn party to provide some variety are Lester (Jason Mewes who has cleaned up his act) Stacey (real-life porn star Katie Morgan who has nearly 200 adult titles on her resume) Bubbles (ex-real-life porn star Traci Lords) and Barry (Ricky Mabe). For two-thirds of its running length Zack and Miri is vintage Smith - profane humor that knows no boundaries and obeys no rules. Whats most amazing about Smiths barrage of hard-R jokes isnt the range of subjects he covers but how few of them ""miss."" If 50% of the material in any comedy generates laughter that movie is an unqualified success. Smith is well over the 50% mark here provided this is your kind of comedy. There is a portion of the audience that might be shocked and appalled (especially by one gag that takes the traditional ""fart joke"" to another level) although its hard to imagine members of that demographic attending a movie with the title Zack and Miri Make a Porno. As far as truth in advertising goes viewers pretty much know going in that this isnt going to be a sweet family values-oriented motion picture. In fact the word ""porno"" has generated a firestorm of controversy with some papers refusing to print ads for the film and some theaters refusing to project it. Never mind that this is a tamer movie than many of the R-rated features that have come along in the past two years but the inclusion of that one little word in the title has gotten some pro-censorship groups hot and bothered. There is no ""porn"" in this ""porno."" The sex scenes are filmed in such a way that nothing graphic is in evidence and the nudity (all of which is provided by Katie Morgan and Jason Mewes) is used for comedic effect and is not presented in a sexual context. Nevertheless one wonders whether Smith welcomes this controversy since it provides plenty of free advertising and is unlikely to discourage one potential viewer from seeing the film. Audiences know what to expect from Smith and he does not disappoint. The ""romantic"" aspect of the ""romantic comedy"" doesnt work as well as the ""comedy"" portion. Most of the movies final third is devoted to Zacks recognition that his feelings for Miri go beyond friendship and the inevitable complications that delay the happily-ever-after moment we know will eventually arrive. Theres chemistry but not much sexual tension between Rogen and Banks and the romance is too heavily backloaded. By the time it shows up in full force it has a tacked-on feel and some of its elements represent standard genre clichA(c)s. In fact - and Kevin Smith probably doesnt want to hear this comparison - theres a lot of When Harry Met Sally in the final act of Zack and Miri (although things seem more rushed). In his romantic comedies Judd Apatow has managed to strum the viewers heartstrings. Smith isnt as adept in that arena but while the romance may not be the most magical to reach the screen most viewers will be laughing so hard they wont care.

Only the Lucasfilm homage is tossed after a few fleeting but promising moments; from there its straight-up sex in a coffee shop after work hours where Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) enlist some new fuck-buddies to shoot their amateur smut opus Swallow My Cockuccino.The View Askew aficionados will lap this up; Zack and Miri is undiluted Dork Knight down to the casting of Superman Brandon Routh as the gay lover of a dude-on-dude porn star played by Justin Long vamping and camping it up after his stint as straight man in Live Free or Die Hard (already perilously close to a porn title). Having gone soft with Jersey Girl (which is looking better all the time) only to regroup by remaking Clerks solely for the diehards Smith here rounds up Judd Apatows familiars (Rogen Banks Craig Robinson The 40-Year-Old Virgins Gerry Bednob) pairs them with his own regulars (Jason Mewes Jeff Anderson) plus Traci Lords and puts ""Porno"" in the title. Still there is something decidedly novel (nay revolutionary) about this particular Kevin Smith film It looks professionally made which counts for something. No longer does a Smith movie play like a vacation slideshow; the camera moves Hes rude sure but no longer rudimentary. (Hes also no longer in Jersey setting Zack and Miri in the frozen tundra of Pittsburgh.)The storylines as conventional as they come. Zack and Miri are childhood friends and roommates who between them can still barely scrape together rent money even though both have jobs and dont exactly live on the brighter side of squalid. Theirs is a perfectly platonic relationship more brother and sister than BFFs. Alas three events conspire to drive them into the adult-entertainment business a chance meeting with Long and Routh at their high school reunion some rather benign YouTubed footage of Miris ""granny panties"" and their electricity getting cut off during the holiday season. What to do? Voila porn Why doesnt everyone think of that?Robinson as Zacks coffee-shop co-worker and the only guy he knows with dough fronts him the necessary coin; the Office vet playing a henpecked husband is terrific as the ""producer"" for whom the auditioning process alone merits the investment. Mewes too is amusing as the dim-witted hunk just looking to bang somebody--at the very least Smith has given his old buddy Jay a role for which hes required to do more than roll it up and smoke it. Truth is Banks and Rogen are forced to grapple with the least interesting characters in the whole movie--slackers in love who when they finally get around to their one porn scene together go all soft-focus in a movie desperately in need of something a little um harder.From its few scatological asides to its inevitable boob shots nothing about Zack and Miri feels terribly fresh much less transgressive. Weve seen Banks and Rogen play-acting porn already at the end of The 40-Year-Old Virgin--she in the hot tub a shower nozzle strategically placed just below the bubbly surface; he off to the side stripping down for a dip into the warm jets. As for the just-plain-folks angle last year saw Jeff Bridges Ted Danson and their own small-stars shrugging their way through The Amateurs--and Blue Movie it wasnt however slight an homage it was to Terry Southerns literary wet dream in which famous faces are buried in regions nether and yon.Amiable and engaging in person and a filmmaker for whom comic and movie nerds so desperately want to root Smith makes two kinds of movies romantic comedies and bromantic comedies with Chasing Amy--his one legitimately great movie--the crossover hybrid hit. Theyre all decidedly conventional affairs save for the detours into gross-out juvenilia that the older Smith gets seem less sincere and feel more like pandering to the audience that goes to his movies solely to walk out with a couple of lines they can quote to each other on the ride home. But the biggest titters at a recent preview screening came during a scene in which Mewes shows off his dick--as though at last Still how Jason Segal of him. Does Apatow always get there first?

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Still Waters Run Deep Kristin Scott Thomas is gravely beguiling in Ive Loved You So Long. Plus the scare-your-pants-off Splinter. By David Edelstein Published Oct 26 2008 ShareThis (Photo Thierry Valletoux/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics) The impolitic-to-the-end Robert Altman complained that while Maggie Smith won the raves and the Oscar nomination for Gosford Park Kristin Scott Thomas gave the richer deeper performance. I wouldnt want to choose between those marvelous actors but its true that Dame Maggie was all (exquisite) sniffles and bleats while Scott Thomas gave her crisp aristocrat layer upon layer of subtext. Theres no chance that Scott Thomas will be overlooked these days with her grand yet pathetic Arkadina in The Seagull on Broadway and now her tour-de-force star turn (in French) in the melancholy drama Ive Loved You So Long. The film is a tease with a cheat of a final disclosure but Philippe Claudels direction is both probing and delicate and Scott Thomass face even immobile keeps you watching searching for hints of her characters past unable to blink for fear of missing something vital. Scott Thomas plays Juliette who comes to live at the home of her much younger sister Lea (Elsa Zylberstein) and husband Luc (Serge Hazanavicius) after a separation of many years. Their first meeting is fraught for reasons we dont yet understandand to say any more poses a huge problem. Ive Loved You So Long is one of those films that generates suspense by withholding the most basic information and parceling it out over the course of the running time. Telling you even its premise would be rude. So Ill only say that its first revelation concerns where Juliette has been; its second why she was there; and its third well thats the ball game and it comes all the way at the endand is as I said a cheat insofar as the central question from a psychological and dramatic standpoint is almost entirely nullified. Whats compelling are the pregnant interactions between Juliette and the world the hostile Luc; the couples bubbly adopted Vietnamese girls who elicit both affection and anguish; Lucs father (Jean-Claude Arnaud) a stroke victim in whose silent company she can rest; and a rather forlorn suitor (Laurent Grevill) who senses that theres something unreachable in this traumatized woman. Most of all the film centers on the tentative relationship between Juliette and Lea who circles her sister moving in and out of intimacy magnetized yet wary of digging too deeply. Perhaps Zylbersteins will be the overlooked performance here which would be unjust. Its her wavering motion that makes Scott Thomass stillness so compelling. One key to Scott Thomass power onscreen is what might broadly be characterized as the tension between feeling and bone structurea tension that exists in many of the cinemas great beauties. There are brief glimpses of inner turbulence but that face though in this film often white and haggard and hollow-eyed retains its finely chiseled form. Juliettes very survival is based on keeping her body upright and her grief contained while we peer at it closely for tremors cracks in the mask. Theres no element of voyeurism thoughClaudels gaze is too compassionate. In Ive Loved You So Long we want to know because we want Juliette to be free. We want along with her sister to share her pain. The comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno has a peerless come-on. Two Pittsburgh apartment-mates (Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks) cant pay their bills and have a Eureka moment Why not get into the amateur sex-video trade? They assemble a John Waterslike family of freaks cobble together a plot based on Star Wars (Star Whores ho ho) and have at it. Although Rogen is the leading man the movie isnt the latest raunchy excrescence from Judd Apatow Factory. Its written and directed by Kevin Smithand hats off to him for being savvy enough to go for a piece of the Apatow action Too bad he doesnt rise to the occasion. There is nudity (not by Banks but a couple of realor as the case may be siliconeporn stars) but the movie is mostly grating banter (F-bombs and anal-sex jokes) with a mushy center. It all comes down to whether Zack and Miri platonic buds for so many years will endanger their friendship by having sex on-camera. And when they do will they realize that theyre meant for each other? Rogen Zack and Miris biggest commercial asset might also be its biggest liability. Now I could be wrong about this Perhaps Rogen is catnip to the ladies the Daniel Craig of sex farce. But this is not a man who appears to take good care of his body and the movie doesnt use his lack of physical appeal as a source of laughsas Apatow sort of did in Knocked Up. The way Smith treats Rogen strikes me as the way hed treat a young Tom Hanks or Jason Segel of Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Justin Long (who has an overlong cameo as a gay-porn actor)the quick-witted nerd who could also be a dreamboat. But when Rogen sheds his clothes and climbs atop the lovely Banks and the bells ring and the fireworks explode well Imagine if James Franco played Zack and Miri was an out-of-shape woman with bad skin and a big honker. Can there be that much of a double standard when it comes to actors looks? 1 2 Next Share this story...

Now hes got the joke part down too and ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is the funniest movie of Smiths Ive seen. Its ""When Harry Did Sally."" PHOTO GALLERY Stoner Movies Zack (Seth Rogen who is almost incapable of being unfunny) and Miri (the always reliable Elizabeth Banks) are two longtime friends who live together in slacker squalor in Pittsburgh where Zack works at a Starbucks-like coffee shop. (Gosh why wouldnt Starbucks want its logo on this film?) They havent paid their bills in so long that their heat and lights go off. But they get both back a little - by burning their unpaid bills. This setup is pretty far from plausible; women who look like Banks dont go hungry (although men who look like Rogen do). And the vigorous use of words that begin with ""mother"" and end with ""ucking"" by everyone even by Indian coffee-shop managers is a bit of a stretch as is Miris telling a guy she has just re-met ""Dont thank me just f - - k me."" But the point is to do (heh heh - I said ""do"") a parody of a chick flick with unrestrained fratty language that makes ""Knocked Up"" look prudish. After a few dull bits at the beginning things get roaring along. At a dismal class reunion where Zack asks an old classmate for a little sex favor in the girls locker room (the look of daring to hope that crosses Rogens face as he does this bit is priceless) and the pair meet a gay porn star and his boyfriend (""So you guys suck each others c - - - s huh?"") an idea begins to form. Soon Zack is turning to Miri taking her trembling hand in his and saying ""Will you have sex with me on camera for money?"" That seems to be their only option (when told he could be a waiter Zack says ""Look at me. No one wants me around their food"") so Zack enlists his co-worker (the increasingly hilarious Craig Robinson of ""The Office"" and ""Pineapple Express"") as producer and starts putting together a porno called ""Star Whores."" Zack is Hung Solo and you dont want to know whats hidden behind one of those metal flaps on R2-Teabag. Things dont go so well. ""I just wanted to see some free t - - - ies"" says the Robinson character in a moment of eloquence. ""But theres no such thing as free t - - - ies."" The movie actually has a plot with reversals of fortune and references to earlier beats. And though the outline of the story is the basic when-will-these-two-kids-notice-theyre-perfect-for-each-other romcom situation the limitless raunch of this raun-com freshens everything up. Even a poo scene is pretty funny (and extremely disgusting) because its been properly set up. Gone are the lengthy monologues from previous Smith films in which he ""dazzles"" (i.e. bores) us with his musings on religion or pop culture. The characters play off each other instead of delivering stand-up routines. And Robinson - whose character has been married to a woman he has known since kindergarten - is even funnier than Rogen practically rotting from backed-up manly fluids.

The bluntly titled ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is a cheerfully vulgar love story or a sweet-hearted sex farce however you want to look at it. Very much of a piece with Kevin Smiths previous down-and-dirty working-stiff comedies the raucous humor here also neatly dovetails with the pants-down funny stuff recently popularized by Judd Apatow. That and the presence of Seth Rogen doing what he does best bodes well for this MGM/Weinstein offering which looks to pocket some nice change in fall release and prove a very popular home-viewing title down the line. If there were any doubt that anyone can make a movie now ""Zack and Miri"" dispels it as the lead characters do it -- and the nasty -- for the sole purpose of making money. Friends since first grade Zack (Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have long lived together in a low-end Pittsburgh house but have never been an item as that would somehow seem weird. Smith opens the floodgates for the sex and potty humor at the outset. Theres scarcely a line of dialogue that doesnt feature the F-word A-word one of the C- or P-words or some variant of them and it isnt long until you have to either decide that its all intolerably stupid or more likely succumb to the downright silliness of it and enjoy the overdose. It would be too much to say that what Smith has come up with here is inspired but it is pretty funny and very energetic. An unlikely night-before-Thanksgiving high school reunion sees Zack push for a bathroom quickie with a married former classmate while Miri embarrasses herself by propositioning the handsomest guy in the room Bobby Long (Brandon ""Superman"" Routh) before discovering hes not only gay but also a big porn star whos in from L.A. with his b.f. (an amusing Justin Long). Inadvertent celebrities when both their asses turn up on You Tube thanks to an opportunistic kid with a videophone Zack and Miri their rent overdue and the water and power cut off have got to find a quick fix for their financial quandary. The title explains their solution but the big discussion centers on whether or not they can bring themselves to do the deed on camera. Of course they can. Still Zack plans the scenario so Miri wont be having sex with anyone else in the film which initially takes shape as a sci-fi takeoff called ""Star Whores"" (wait didnt Mel Brooks long ago do ""Spaceballs""?). Zack assembles a motley crew consisting of ""producer"" and casting director Delaney (Craig Robinson) his longtime fellow coffee-shop workmate whos comically oversensitive to any perceived insult to his blackness; Lester (Jason Mewes) a young man who can be ready for action at the snap of the fingers; Bubbles (porn legend Traci Lords) who lives up to her name in more ways than one; Barry (Ricky Mabe) a pliable young fellow; Deacon (Jeff Anderson) who qualifies as d.p. by having photographed high school football and Stacey (""Porn 101"" star Katie Morgan) who will do specialty acts. As lensing gets under way despite an initial setback Zack cant believe how much fun filmmaking is and Miri tells him he actually seems ambitious for the first time in his life. When the time comes for their big scene for which they never rehearsed at home it goes differently than either of them would have expected leading both to assess their relationship in a new way. What the scene really is however is yet another fantasy now explicit and familiar due to the Apatow stables output of a chubby geeky guy getting it on with a gorgeous young woman and her digging it. Naturally chubby geeky guys will dig the sight of it. Resolution shows theres both a closet romantic and a good little Catholic boy still deep inside Smith somewhere. Chemistry between Rogen and Banks is excellent; he bangs out the crude talk with well-practiced nonchalant expertise and shes totally game throwing it right back at him. Robinsons deadpan outrage and acceptance of insanity see him neatly underplaying everyone else and everyone else pitches in to create a nutty group portrait of try-anything common folk. Dead-of-winter Pittsburgh locations create a sense of ever-present adversity thats funny in itself; pacing is ultra-snappy production values what they need to be. A post-fade-out faux promotional video is worth sticking around for. Zack and Miri Make a PornoProductionAn MGM release (in U.S.) of a Weinstein Company presentation of a View Askew production.
