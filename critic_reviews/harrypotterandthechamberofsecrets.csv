The game? Seeing who could find the most billboards for ""8 Mile."" (Absent a tally-taker my grandson and his buddy both claimed victory.) Yet these kids on the cusp of premature unkidhood were delighted by the second screen installment of J.K. Rowlings prodigiously successful series. Fantasy ruled even though forbidden R-rated excitement had beckoned. For my part I was pleasantly surprised and glad to be so given the dearth of movies that deserve to be respected by young audiences. This new ""Harry Potter"" has its flaws but its better as well as darker than the first. Its also longer by nine minutes but hold that protest to the Kidney Foundation; the time flies albeit in fits and starts like players on a Quidditch field. One reason is that ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been able to dispense with all the exposition and introductions of the first film. Ill do the same. Suffice it to say that Harry is back for his second term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where a mysterious terror threatens to close the school unless someone -- who might he be? -- stands up to the forces of evil. (Its actually more interesting than that since Harry discovers ample grounds for self-doubt and the evil is redolent at least for adults of Nazi-era eugenics.) Other areas of conspicuous improvement include Chris Columbuss direction which seems more confident and supple though its still far from stylish and Daniel Radcliffes performance in the title role. He has matured relatively speaking into a take-charge pubescent with a lower voice and higher energy. On the other hand the still-endearing Rupert Grint who plays Harrys buddy Ron Weasly has started mugging and Ron isnt even a Muggle. Theres also a servile elf named Dobby who manages to be simultaneously amusing and annoying; a supposedly homeopathic crop of shrieking mandrake roots; and most helpfully in a film that could do with more laughs a spirited and witty performance by Kenneth Branagh as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Gilderoy Lockhart. (Lockhart is a self-enchanted cross between Douglas Fairbanks and the bumbling Wizard of Oz.) Emma Watson Maggie Smith Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are back as respectively young Hermione Granger not-young Professor McGonagall not-nice Professor Snape and not-svelte Hagrid the Giant who looks quite like Peter Jackson the director of ""Lord of the Rings."" And this is alas the last chance to see the late Richard Harris lurk behind the flowing beard of Hogwartss headmaster Albus Dumbledore. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" suffers predictably from a bigger-and-louder-is-better aesthetic that afflicts certain stretches such as a new Quidditch game and a sequence in which the kids steal a flying car. (I may be prejudiced here since the car an old Ford Anglia looks exactly like an Anglia I once owned and despised; my miserable heap could barely climb hills.) Whats more a monster snake makes the movie much too scary for small children an encounter with a giant spider could have profited from a scene-shortening spell and a climax celebrating Hagrid seems to have been spliced in from another picture. All in all though ""Chamber of Secrets"" will be magical enough for its audience and lucrative enough for its producers. The next installment is to be directed by Alfonso Cuaron whose films include the lovely ""A Little Princess"" and the astonishing ""Y Tu Mama Tambien."" For that one I cant wait. Standing in the Shadows of Motown ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" is a glorious feature-length documentary that sings the praises of hitherto unsung musical heroes. In it the son of one legendary artist James Jamerson displays an upright bass that his late father played then points out what he calls an ""indentment"" on the instrument where Jamerson held his thumb. This film will leave an indentment and a deep one on anyone who loves great joyous music and cares about the people who make it. The standees of the title are a group of men known as the Funk Brothers superlatively gifted instrumentalists who in the 1960s and early 1970s created what came to be called the Motown Sound. They were members of the studio band. Their music was the nourishing ocean that Motowns biggest fish swam in. They played behind Marvin Gaye Diana Ross the Temptations the Four Tops Stevie Wonder Smokey Robinson and all the rest played on more monster hits than the Beatles Elvis Presley the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys combined. Yet fame eluded them; big money did too. As the film observes with an excess of equanimity fans and musicologists alike have claimed to find the secret of the Motown Sound in everything from the labels stars to its producers or the wood on the studio floor yet theyve overlooked or underheard the most obvious source of all the studio musicians. The film which was directed by Paul Justman narrated by Andre Braugher and inspired by the book of the same title by Allan Slutsky allows you to hear the musicians and their music as never before. Background is brought to foreground in a wealth of reminiscences interviews with surviving members film clips from the distant past and superb concert footage from the recent past when the reunited Funk Brothers played at Detroits Royal Oak Music Theater behind such singers as Joan Osborne Ben Harper Bootsy Collins Chaka Khan and Meshell Ndegeocello. In one great story after another -- and in several ill-advised and superfluous re-enactments -- we hear how these players did what they did and why they did it. Many of them touched by the muse in childhood seem to have been musics chosen instruments rather than choosers of their lifes work. Many were grounded in jazz though all music spoke to them. (Johnny Griffith had classical training while Joe Hunter who as a kid heard Rachmaninoff in recital in Detroit recalls that the Russian pianist and composer had ""a terrific left hand."") The other Funk Brothers interviewed for the film are Jack Ashford Bob Babbitt Uriel Jones Joe Messina and Eddie Willis. Last weekend Griffith died in Detroit at the age of 66 just hours before the films local premiere. He still lives vividly though with his Brothers onscreen. El Crimen del Padre Amaro ""El Crimen del Padre Amaro"" is nothing if not newsworthy. This Spanish-language film made in Mexico stars Gael Garcia Bernal (of ""Amores Perros"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") as a hunky young priest who gets a beautiful young girl pregnant behaves despicably and not only gets away with it but becomes a local hero. The drama extends to corrupt city officials; drug money laundered courtesy of the church through construction for a hospital; and a good priest (played by a good actor Damian Alcazar) defrocked. But the tone is that of a telenovela -- soap-operatic at heart -- even though the film was adapted from a 19th-century novel. With the all-too-real problems of the church and its priesthood in the news every day Father Amaros crime seems oddly remote. Interview With the Assassin Neil Burgers ""Interview With the Assassin"" may be something of a stunt but its a fascinating stunt that holds your attention from the start to shortly before the finish. Simply put its the pseudo-documentary record of an encounter between Ron Kobeleski (Dylan Haggerty) an unemployed TV cameraman and his sick aging neighbor Walter Ohlinger (Raymond J. Barry) who claims to be almost 40 years after the fact the second gunman in President Kennedys assassination. Walter offers little tangible proof apart from a spent shell casing and several ambiguous meetings with supposed associates. The plausibility of his claim rests mainly on the eerie deformations of his personality -- he is paranoid and proud of it; laconic to the point of zero affect; and world-weary though with a residue of rage. (Walter himself is a spent shell casing.) Theres a slight ""Blair Witch Project"" tinge to Walters tale but Mr. Barrys steely performance is a reminder of how commanding certain storytellers can be. We believe what we want to or need to. The Way Home Parables rarely make good movies -- theyre instructive stories that havent been fully fleshed out -- and the Korean-language film ""The Way Home"" is basically a parable of old and young traditional and modern. Still its affecting even touching provided you can put up with its sclerotic pace which is set by the rural setting a tiny impoverished village and by the 78-year-old heroine Kim Eul-Boon a nonprofessional who plays a version of her indomitable self. Granny Kim is mute and so stooped when she walks that her body forms an almost perfect inverted L. She lives alone in quiet isolation until her seven-year-old grandson Sang-Woo (Yoo Seung-Ho) is left to stay with her while Mom looks for work in Seoul. The sentimental side of the script focuses on the love that grows -- ever so slowly -- between the old woman and the spoiled bratty boy but the most interesting part which isnt sentimental at all is just how spoiled a Korean city boy can be. (Korean friends tell me the film doesnt exaggerate.) Incapable of empathy at the outset Sang-Woo demands ""Kentucky chicken"" and falls into a state akin to grief when the battery gives out on his Game Boy. Thats real isolation.    VIDEO TIP Richard Harris was a swashbuckling -- and intensely romantic -- sea captain in ""Hawaii"" (1966) the sprawling screen version of James Micheners saga that was directed by George Roy Hill.

With Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Richard Harris Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane. Directed by Chris Columbus. Running time 161 mins. PG scary moments creature violence mild language. 2 1/2 STARS Having read and loved J.K. Rowlings ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" and been greatly disappointed by Chris Columbus filmed adaptation of it I decided not to read the second book so I could watch ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" cold. The experience was better. Ive since read the second book and the gap between the talents of Rowling and Columbus is still apparent. But the filmmaker does seem at least partially liberated by having already established a physical reality for Harry and his Hogwarts world. Darker funnier and more action-packed than the first film ""Chamber"" seems inspired as much by Steven Spielbergs galloping ""Raiders of the Lost Ark. "" Columbus didnt make up the subterranean tunnels oversize snakes scampering spiders and various cliffhangers but hes virtually lifted the ending of ""Raiders"" whose Nazi villains were roasted in a kind of cosmic furnace. This years adventure has Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) trying to save Hogwarts from the evil that lurks in the Chamber of Secrets a labyrinthine space within the confines of the gothic school. It has been 50 years since the Chamber was last breached and on that occasion a Muggle-born - a wizard with nonmagical parents - was killed. The ghost of the victim now known as Moaning Myrtle inhabits an abandoned girls bathroom and its there that Harry and friends will find their way into the daunting Chamber. Theres a richer subtext here than in ""The Sorcerers Stone"" a metaphorical parallel to the proponents throughout history of ethnic cleansing. The Chambers secret has to do with the origin of Slytherin House whose members have loathed and rued the presence of Muggle-borns ever since. Now as ""mud bloods"" like Hermione are being turned to stone and Profs. Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris) McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Snape (Alan Rickman) are fretting over the fate of Hogwarts Harry must save the day. Two terrific new characters are along for the second ride. As Gilderoy Lockhart the blow-hard teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts a hilariously preening Kenneth Branagh adds humor that was sorely missing from ""The Sorcerers Stone. "" And Jason Isaacs so perfectly venomous in ""The Patriot"" is Lucius Malfoy the sneering father of Harrys archrival from Slytherin. ""Chamber"" is chockablock with action (including a far more exciting game of Quidditch) and crafty special effects. Among them a sequence in which Ron accidentally casts a spell on himself and barfs up a bunch of sticky slugs; his fathers flying independent-minded car an updated Ford from the Model T in ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" and the digitally animated Dobby a sniveling half-pint lop-eared elf who is both friend and foe to Harry. As in the first film however there are also regrettably cheesy effects notably the transparent ghosts of Moaning Myrtle and of John Cleeses Nearly Headless Nick. Theyre like double-exposures on a snapshot and simply remind us how far weve come since the ""Topper"" movies. Radcliffe 3 inches taller and an octave lower than last year is growing comfortably into his character as is Watson the fetching and confident Hermione. The redheaded Grint meanwhile needs to expand his acting tricks beyond the double-take and shocked stare. Sadly its all too evident in Harris performance how sick he was during production. He looks frail but worse his voice has almost no volume and he appears macabrely ridiculous in a flashback in which Dumbledore is meant to be 50 years younger. With more time some merciful editing would have helped. At two hours 41 minutes ""Chamber"" is too long by a half-hour and there are extraneous scenes that total about that amount. Still ""Chamber"" is an upgrade in the movie series. And with Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") taking over for next years ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" things definitely are looking up at Hogwarts.

Share Tweet Like its predecessor Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets works perfectly well as a cinematic corollary to J.K. Rowlings adored childrens fantasy series. Quidditch self-loathing house elves and basilisks all make it to the screen intact a well-chosen cast helps make the wild notions convincing and director Chris Columbus presents it all in an attractive thoroughly watchable package. But try imagining a universe in which the Harry Potter series existed only in film form. Would audiences still find themselves transported by such thinly drawn characters? Would the imaginations still leap for the nonstop assault of impressively realized but creatively pedestrian special effects? And would the two-and-a-half-hours-plus trek toward an unmasking straight out of Scooby Doo seem quite so satisfying? So far the series has relied on viewers familiarity with Rowlings characters to fill in blanks that other movies would have to fill for themselves. As before Daniel Radcliffe gives an assured performance in the lead but hes given so little time away from after-hours sleuthing and confrontations with bugaboos that hes mostly a sympathetic character because hes playing Harry Potter not because of any moment within the movie itself. It doesnt help that Chamber is pretty much all business from the opening shot trading in Stones sometimes-clunky exposition for full-steam-ahead action that whisks Radcliffe back to Hogwarts for another year of intrigue and spellcasting with scarcely a moment to collect his syllabi. In the space between the scenes of kids screaming amid special effects the grownups have the best moments. Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane Alan Rickman and the late Richard Harris all reprise roles from the previous film and Kenneth Branagh has a funny part as a self-obsessed celebrity charlatan. The movie could use more of him and of droll touches like John Cleeses unfailingly polite nearly headless ghost but overall Chamber is very much in the spirit of John Williams score a succession of irritatingly familiar swooping climaxes hammered out at double fortissimo. Its enough to make viewers of a certain temperament want to curl up with a good book.

The film beautifully realizes many of Rowlings fantastic conceits--the Whomping Willow a tree that nearly kills Harry and a pal after they land their flying car in its branches; the thrilling Quidditch match in which players zoom around on broomsticks chasing a hyperkinetic rugby ball; a nocturnal visit to the Forbidden Forest complete with giant tarantula chase--but for the last hour I was searching for a spell to make the credits appear. With Alan Rickman Maggie Smith a visibly ailing Richard Harris and Kenneth Branagh perfectly cast as the vain author Gilderoy Lockhart.

(A lot of kids to be sure.) Grown-ups who were equally bewitched by J. K. Rowlings book felt let down by the movie it followed the letter of the tale but missed the spirit mistaking special effects for magic. Would the filmmakers learn from their mistakes in the second installment? Wanting to give the movie the benefit of the doubt I avoided reading ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" before I saw Columbuss follow-up. This time the twists and turns of Harrys adventures at Hogwarts--where he encounters even greater perils--could take me by surprise.The real surprise alas is that ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been turned into a kiddie monster movie. It is aimed at an older audience this time--tween and teenage boys. Now the walls of Hogwarts are defaced with dire warnings written in blood. Harry and Ron are terrorized by an army of giant spiders that scuttle about like stragglers from ""Starship Troopers."" Our hero no longer the diffident uncertain wizard wields a sword in mini-Schwarzenegger style as he faces down a gargantuan snake that is sure to traumatize the under-6 set and just as likely to produce yawns from elders who have sat through one too many creature-filled Hollywood action extravaganzas. Somehow I dont think this is what Rowling had in mind. The monsters are all straight out of the book but they are vanquished briskly on the page. Rowling never belabors the violence; Columbus cant think of anything else to do. For him the action set pieces are the movies raison detre and they contribute mightily to the bloated 2-hour 45-minute running time.Before it degenerates into Indiana Potter and the Chamber of Doom the movie holds promise. Cinematographer Roger Pratt has replaced John Seale and the images are crisper and less murky. The three young stars--Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson--radiate a newfound confidence. Kenneth Branagh adds a nice flourish of comic relief as Gilderoy Lockhart the celebrity Defense Against the Dark Arts professor whose towering self-regard is matched only by his magical incompetence. Further chuckles are supplied by the computer-generated Dobby the House Elf (voice of Toby Jones) a mischief-making masochist whose servility disguises his true intentions. Alan Rickman the highlight of ""Sorcerers Stone"" takes a back seat here; villainy honors go to Jason Isaacss Lucius Malfoy (blond father of blond Draco). Isaacs memorable as the bad Brit in ""The Patriot"" oozes freeze-dried evil. Sadly the recent death of Richard Harris adds a special poignance to his final turn as the great wizard Dumbledore. His sweet whispery line readings sound as if theyre etched on delicate aged parchment. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Columbus has boasted that ""Chamber"" is faster paced than the original because its not bogged down with exposition. He doesnt seem to realize that the exposition--also known as character development--is what gives the tale charm. Someone coming to this movie without having seen the first would have no sense of what makes brainy supercilious Hermione special. Steve Klovess script is so busy keeping the action coming that the quirks of Rowlings characters get lost. Yes ""Chamber of Secrets"" moves with a brisk stride but speed isnt necessarily an improvement if it flattens out the emotional landscape. ""Chamber of Secrets"" seems even more an impersonal studio project than the first--a trend that perhaps Alfonso Cuaron (""A Little Princess"" ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") the next installments gifted director can buck if Warner Bros. lets him.Columbuss movie ends (Im not giving anything away) with a standing ovation in the Hogwarts dining hall thats meant to be a rousing emotional moment. But oddly the object of the celebration hasnt done anything in the course of the movie to warrant the outburst--hes been on the sidelines of the action. The scene which isnt in the book is just a generic feel-good climax arbitrarily pasted on and the filmmakers obviously think nobody will notice. But it hints at why the Harry Potter movies arent half as wonderful as they ought to be why they feel created from the outside in. Magic isnt made by committee.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Do they still care? Judging from the preview audience of mesmerized moppets with whom I saw Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  they do indeed and then some. The second installment is darker and more schematic than the first and in the opinion of this aging Muggle not as much fun. With characters and setting already established director Chris Columbus and writer Steven Kloves cut through the exposition and hurl you right into the narrative. As Harry (saucer-eyed Daniel Radcliffe) returns to his second year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry something evil is slithering through the rusty old drain pipes turning the students into petrified statues of stone and threatening to close the place down. But first theres some funny business about the ghastly summer Harry has just spent with his horrible relatives the Dursleys who have nailed his windows shut. Harry is rescued by his redheaded pal Ron (Rupert Grint) but they cant get through the magic gate at London station so they miss the Hogwarts express train and are forced to travel back to school in a flying Ford Anglia. Incurring the wrath of sourpuss potions professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) when their car crashes into the academys centuries-old Whomping Willow tree the young wizards are saved from expulsion once again by kindly old headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris in his final role). The film settles down to business as usual at Gryffindor dorm where eccentric witch Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) conducts classes in how to change small animals into water goblets. The old gang is back and there are a few new additions notably the malevolent Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) the father of Harrys arch-nemesis Draco and a ruthless villain with a snake-headed cane and waist-length blond hair and a dashing new professor named Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) who teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts classes. Gilderoy is a vain pompous celebrity wizard who spends a lot of time answering his fan mail and autographing copies of his autobiography Magical Me . This setup is amusing and too lengthy for its own good but when the film gains momentum the horrors that await the students come fast and furious. Harry hears evil voices. Warnings appear on the wall written in blood-something about a chamber of secrets hidden for a thousand years in which a hideous monster lies dormant. Somebody has unlocked the chamber and the whole school turns against Harry thinking hes the descendant of the wizard who put the curse on the place. Determined to find the chamber prove them wrong save his adorable girlfriend Hermione (Emma Watson) from death and free the school from the curse Harry must concoct a slug repellent made from screaming mandrake plants and face Aragog a humongous tarantula in the Dark Forest who controls an army of flesh-eating spiders. The plot leads to the master villain Lord Voldemort the murderous wizard responsible for the trademark scar on Harrys forehead. Voldemort was defeated by Harry in the first installment but now hes trying for a comeback through the blank pages of a secret diary discovered by the dastardly Malfoy. By the time Harry encounters the monster in the bowels of Hogwarts the big showdown seems almost anachronistic and the foaming fanged reptile will hardly raise a hair on the head of anyone who has already seen the Alien movies. Most of the kids around me covered their eyes and screamed in horror but I found Eminem in 8 Mile twice as scary. None of this makes one bit of sense but children dont ask questions and take everything at face value anyway. They wont give a fig that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is so convoluted that it loses coherence fast. What do they care if there are too many plot twists too many extraneous diversions for no other purpose than to pad the running time and so many villains at cross purposes that I couldnt tell them apart? The kids have read the books studied the symbolism and know whats coming next. In my opinion the movie will scare the living daylights out of young children and confuse the hell out of grownups. At nearly three hours this one is also something of an endurance test. Still the special effects and magic tricks are clever the thrills are undeniable the characters invented by J. K. Rowling are as charming as they are bizarre and repeat business is guaranteed. (A word of advice to the filmmakers who are busily counting their percentages Make future Harry Potters quickly before the young cast members outgrow their roles. In one scene the cherubic little Harry raises his trouser cuffs. Hes already got very hairy legs.) If I enjoyed this follow-up to the first Harry Potter less than I did the original blame it on my loss of innocence. In all fairness I must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks. If I was baffled and bored they were enthralled and enchanted-which is exactly what the Harry Potter market aims for. I surrender cheerfully. Movies for 10-year-old audiences should really be reviewed by 10-year-old critics. Sharp Mexican Morality Tale For adult fare I prefer Carlos Carreras Mexican film The Crime of Father Amaro  a sharp morality tale about a priest who breaks his vows of celibacy for the love of a beautiful girl that will probably raise the hackles of the Catholic Church to new heights of indignation. When it opened in Mexico it was picketed and denounced by irate Catholics in the same way Miramaxs forthcoming release of the brilliant Irish film The Magdalene Sisters is being protested here. That didnt stop it from becoming the highest-grossing Mexican film in history. Such apoplexy not only seems pointless in light of all the religious scandals that are making headlines daily but also laughably belated considering that its based on a famous book by Portuguese novelist Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz first published in 1875. Dont these people ever get tired of slugging it out in public over matters of faith that should remain private? To the small Mexican town of Los Reyes comes a handsome newly ordained 24-year-old priest. Father Amaro (played by Gael Garcia Bernal the hottest actor in Mexico) is a favorite of the bishop and will soon be going to Rome for more devout study but first he must get some field experience. In Los Reyes he is assigned to an older cynical priest Father Benito who has long been involved in money-laundering for mobsters and forbidden sex with women. Father Amaro watches the corruption surrounding him with shocked silence-but when he meets the virginal extremely religious Amelia the 16-year-old daughter of Father Benitos longtime lover his own weaknesses as a man slowly build. As the unsophisticated priest succumbs to Amelias innocence and sweetness the groundwork is laid for the films central theme-the difficulty of forced celibacy for the clergy. As Father Amaro struggles with the churchs demands and his own inner passions Mr. Carrera examines other complex relationships-the ecumenical politics of the church and issues of power and economic depression in the poor regions of a country where the peasants are often victimized by the very priests they trust for spiritual guidance. The church Mr. Carrera suggests doesnt always serve the faithful and often looks the other way when it suits a purpose. In the story a good priest is condemned and excommunicated for helping local guerrillas while a bad priest is revered despite his sexual proclivities and his close relationship with the parish drug lord. Father Amaro abhors this kind of duplicity yet remains closeted when it comes to his own clandestine affair with the impressionable Amelia. Its important to point out that the film doesnt denounce the church; it merely serves as a wake-up call for the human rights of the men who serve it. Father Amaro is no saint Hes a human being subject to the same human temptations as everyone else. The film doesnt condone his fallibility. When his lust leads to Amelias pregnancy and abortion he pays for his ""crime"" with tragic consequences for everyone involved. Ironically his faith is still sacred and with the help of the bishop his ambitious religious career continues to flourish. The story is timeless but when adapted to the modern age it makes for a wrenching film-never preachy or sentimental and refreshingly non-judgmental about the fundamental and contradictory issues it raises. At a time when the priesthood is under constant attack and the scalding reverberations of clerical sin are being felt all the way to the Vatican its also a work of intense relevance. While Mr. Carrera creates a stunningly real three-dimensional study of souls in torment he also displays a profound sense of compassion amid the misery chaos and seeming expendability of life that affirms the humanity of his characters. The performances are all vivid and sincere but its the talent and charisma of the films star that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Mr. Bernal the sensation of last years surprise hit Y Tu Mama Tambien  is the sexiest Mexican import since Dolores Del Rio and the screens most sensitive priest since Montgomery Clift in Alfred Hitchcocks I Confess . In addition to his devastating good looks the boy can really act. With Mr. Bernals swimming-pool eyes and an almost ethereal sensuality his naturalistic portrayal of the conflicted Father Amaro is haunting hypnotic vulnerable and deeply affecting. Here is an actor obviously attracted to controversial assignments. After playing the carnal priest in this film he will next star in Pedro Almodovars Bad Education  playing a young man sexually abused by a priest in Spain. If this isnt an international star in the making my name is Donald Duck. One final note According to an alarming press release from the folks publicizing the films American opening the conservative element in the Catholic Church in Mexico has been pleading with President Vincente Fox to censor The Crime of Father Amaro as a ""sacrilege"" appealing to his stature as Mexicos most openly Catholic president. Mr. Foxs government not only refused the boycott it also selected The Crime of Father Amaro to represent Mexico in the contention for a Best Foreign Film Academy Award. In these repressive times thats the kind of progressive thinking in the war against hypocrisy the world could use a lot more of.

"Harrys Slight Sophomore Slump washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Harrys Slight Sophomore Slump Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 15 2002 OKAY SO the plot -- about a sinister force at large at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- is slow and unwieldy. And few of the characters get as much time to flower as they did in the first film. And there may not be a human bladder in this good land that can outlast the running time (more than 2 1/2 hours). And I sure could have done without a new character named Dobby the House Elf who makes me think of Jar Jar Binks. But for the most part ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" adapted once again from J.K. Rowlings book by Steve Kloves and directed by Chris Columbus still affords many pleasures. I think most viewers especially the younger ones will reap its joys. And besides who would stand in the way of ""Harry Potter"" and all those kids and parents queued around the blocks of every multiplex? Certainly not little Muggle me. Another plus an amusing performance from Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart the self-legendizing new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts whose narcissist autobiographies are endless. The movie also marks one of Richard Harriss final screen appearances. As Albus Dumbledore hes wonderfully graceful. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has had a miserable summer with his Muggle family the Dursleys (Richard Griffiths Fiona Shaw) and their miserable son Dudley (Harry Melling). Someone seems to have blocked all correspondence with his school pals Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). Turns out its Jar Jar I mean Dobby a computer-generated elf (voice of Toby Jones) who cant reveal his full agenda but wants Harry to know he should not return for his sophomore year. And why is this? Somethings lurking in the bowels of this British boarding school. (Apart from the obviously entrenched fear of changing one word of the original J.K. Rowling novel.) Its a nasty presence whose targets are mudbloods or students of non-magical background. (If you sense a mini-metaphor for racial intolerance full marks to you.) Perhaps it has to do with grim bottle-blond student Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his equally frosty-noggined Dad Lucius (Jason Isaacs)? The eye of suspicion is even turned toward our own H. Potter who often seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. But enough of the plot lets get to other things. Lets look at this movie as the glass half full rather than half empty. Sure its too bad that the funnier members of the cast including Robbie Coltrane (as Hagrid) Alan Rickman (Professor Severus Snape) Griffiths and Julie Walters (Rons Mom Mrs. Weasley) are rendered into near-cameo players. And the less said about actor Grints one-dimensional muggings the better. But theyre all in there arent they? Nothing from the book is left to wither away. That should please the vast reading audience thatll watch the movie. Its also unfortunate that were given shorter shrift with some of the first movies memorable elements Diagon Alley (where great wands can be bought) the high-flying game of Quidditch Harrys cloak of invisibility and magic itself. (Harry runs afoul of magic transportation powder and speaks the language of snakes. Yet hardly produces a spell.) But we do get a taste of everything. Which should be enough to make everyone obey the movies simple formula Get in line. HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS (PG 161 MINUTES) -- Contains some emotionally intense moments.

Starring Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Kenneth Branagh Alan Rickman Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane Richard Harris Director Chris Columbus Running time 242 Release Opened Nov 14 2002  Editorial Review Nothing up his sleeve Harry Potter sequel misses quite a few storytelling tricks By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday November 14 2002 Only another wizard could help Harry Potter. Thats why he needs to take the 717 tornado to the Emerald City and get in line behind Dorothy the Cowardly Lion the Scarecrow and the Tin Man. And after giving out a balloon ride to Kansas a medal and so forth the Mighty Oz could turn to little Harry and inquire ""Say arent you k.d. lang?"" ""No sir Im Harry Potter."" ""Hmmm. You look just like k.d. lang. Anyway what do you want?"" ""Sir please sir Id like a ... story."" But there are some problems that not even the mighty Wizard of Oz or the mighty wizards of Warner Bros. can solve and thats why ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is big dull and empty. Small kids who are entertained by aquariums lava lamps melting ice cream and other forms of random motion might enjoy it - when theyre not peeing in their pants because of the giant snake at the end - but most human creatures who have evolved to sentience will be ground into numbness by its drear totalitarianism. I have no idea who the fraud is author J.K. Rowling screen adapter Steve Kloves or hapless chopless effects-mad director Chris Columbus who come to think of it pretty much always makes flat dull movies (""Stepmom""). Whatever whichever whoever nobody associated with this production appears to have thought hard about storytelling - about to borrow a felicitous phrase the uses of enchantment. The whole thing is a strange combination of frenzy where there should be placidity and placidity where there should be frenzy. Nothing much happens in the story proper but a great deal happens outside it. In other words it looks like a movie it sounds like a movie you see it in a movie theater but its not a movie. Its like a 2 1/2-hour preview. The film lacks what might be called a whole theory of story. It never understands the difference between dramatic incidents that amplify theme and character and build to an inevitable yet stunning conclusion leaving the reader or viewer spent and happy; and arbitrary incidents that eat up screen time but dont advance the journey or the characters at all lead nowhere and wind up in a climax no matter how spectacular that thematically has nothing to do with what has come before. In short nothing is connected nothing coheres theres no game plan really. Its just a bunch of happenings that ape the progress of a story but never quite reach the threshold of narrative. The movie opens with Harry played by the unimpressive Daniel Radcliffe unhappily ensconced in the middle-class purgatory of the real world where his specialness merely categorizes him as an oddball. While downstairs his dreary bourgeois uncle is trying to butter up a client with the help of the rest of the bourgeois family - the movies contempt for the English middle class is quite an explosion of pure snobbery - upstairs weird Harry is dealing with Dobby a house elf come to visit. Dobby a digitally pixeled nethercreature who looks like a benign gargoyle has come to warn Harry of - well of something. Thats the movies pathology in a nutshell a fabulous special-effects creation of a spectacularly imagined mythic critter that is used for a few laughs and to implant a vague sense of unease into the story and then vanishes. All the way through in fact the movie overplays the mundane and fails to illuminate the dramatic. As Harry and a wizard buddy try to get back to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry they have spectacular adventures in a flying Ford Anglia including an epic battle with a willow tree that briefly and strangely becomes something like a giant squid. To what end? To no end. This 20 minutes connects with nothing is not a part of the rest of the story; it just is and then its gone. The same is true of so much including two conflicts with Harrys nasty blond competitor in the school world Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton and seven pounds of hair gel) one a dinnertime wand-battle in the Great Hall of Bad Boarding School Food the other a repetition of that aerial rollerball game played in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" - all sound all fury narrative significance zero. The most dramatic thing that happens over the movies entire 162 minutes Harry takes a stairway shaped like a screaming eagle up to Albus Dumbledores office It appears that behind the vague sense of unease gripping the Hogwarts school there is a mystery. But it doesnt so much lurk as loaf. And however strange are these goings-on they are not so strange as to cause any panic or school cancellations much less a sense of urgency or danger. In fact heres what they cause nothing. The plot points buttressing this supposedly increasing sense of unease are extremely tepid The first is the warning by the Dobby the second is some muttering that only Harry can hear the third and fourth are the paralysis of various students and strange warnings painted on the walls of the school. Finally Harry ""solves"" the case by finding a diary that explains everything and what it explains is hardly worth the effort to get there a secret chamber under the school where ugliness and violence lurk. At that point the movie lurches into its best sustained sequence which of course is completely disconnected from what came before. It feels more like outtakes from ""Conan Jr. the Barbarian"" Harry suddenly finds himself opposing a villain who is pretty much brand-new to the movie and who will have no meaning to those few of us who havent committed the Potter canon to memory. This bad boy calls up his big snake and Harry with a sword must fight the creature. Its quite an intense battle if for no other reason that its pure action without all the magical hocus-pocus the cutesy names the ludicrous sentimentality for the English public school experience Its just man vs. beast to the death. Melville could have written it. Parents are forewarned that the really young kids might refight it in nightmares for years to come. The immediate cast of youngsters is unimpressive. Radcliffe is indeed coming more and more into k.d. lang with that severe shock of hair that pale inert angular face those damned cute glasses. His two cohorts are even less impressive. Pal Weasley is played by Rupert Grint with too much going on in his face; pal Hermione (Emma Watson) has too much hair though of the three shes the sprightliest. The rest of the cast is mostly old Brits underused and (one hopes) overpaid with the single exception of Kenneth Branagh who turns in an amusing if ultimately irrelevant performance as the schools most narcissistic teacher. But why waste the great Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane Richard Harris Jason Isaacs Fiona Shaw John Cleese Julie Walters and most tragic of all Alan Rickman in nothing roles that demand but a tenth of their formidable talents? Theyre simply window dressing to up the class quotient. Actually ""Harry Potter"" isnt really selling story to begin with. It seems to have struck a chord that renders story largely irrelevant Its an almost pitch-perfect exercise in adolescent yearning disguised (poorly) as a fairy tale. Harry eternal outsider knows as do all adolescents and most adult film critics that he is somehow ""special."" The process of the movie isnt the story itself but watching as Harrys specialness is proved once again to the rest of the world. Hes like Holden Caulfield lost in a permanent multimillion-dollar game of Dungeons and Dragons. Contains mock violence though the concluding battle with a nightmare creature is very intense.

Not just Daniel Radcliffe and his boy wizard both of whom are older and wiser in the second installment Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets which opens today. But the franchise itself is maturing. The planned series of seven based on the J.K. Rowling best sellers is gradually creating a magic all its own. Daniel Radcliffe is back as Harry Potter in Secrets. Secrets predecessor Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was the event of the season last year. It went on to become the top-grossing film of 2001 taking in 318 million in North America and landing behind only Titanic in all-time gross. But many critics and some moviegoers thought it a bit tedious and lacking in humor and imaginative fancy largely because filmmakers were so faithful to the letter of the book. Though this one isnt expected to do as well at the box office as the first movie (sequels rarely do) the film reflects a confidence that could win over reluctant fans and solidify the Potter franchise as an event for years to come. ""You dont need to sell 900 million worth of tickets to be a huge success"" says Seth Siegel co-founder and licensing chairman of The Beanstalk Group the worlds largest trademark licensing company. ""Whether its a little more or a little less than the first time it cant do anything but enormous numbers. The franchise is very very healthy and moving forward."" Advance ticket sales ""are on par with last years maybe even a little better"" says Robert Bucksbaum president of Reel Source Inc. which tracks box office sales. In this installment the bespectacled wizard hero is 12 in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and facing his biggest challenge yet identifying and fighting a dark magic that could take over the academy. His closest pals Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and his archenemy Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) are back as are many other original characters. There are some distinctive new faces as well notably Kenneth Branagh as the comically self-absorbed Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Isaacs as the slyly villainous Lucius Malfoy. But for this movie the book became less gospel more guide in part because the success of the first movie bolstered director Chris Columbus ability to be bold. Stone was nearly an hour longer than most family films (2 hours 31 minutes) and industry watchers fretted that kids couldnt sit still that long. Instead some fans complained that the movie was too short. This time they might be satisfied Secrets runs 10 minutes longer. Stone was thought to be too scary for children another fear that proved unfounded. This time there are even darker moments Harry hears creepy voices that no one else can pick up and finds frightening messages written in blood. As a class assignment he and his pals must repot (and later slice) shrieking mandrake plants that look like a combination of vegetable root and hideous baby. Harry and Ron are nearly squashed to death by a killer tree known as the whomping willow and are attacked by swarms of giant spiders. The underlying themes are darker too and more serious. Where Stone narrowly drew on the differences between the world of wizards and the non-magical world of muggles Secrets emphasizes the evils of racism. There is an effort underway led mostly by the cruel Lucius Malfoy and his bully son Draco to purify the wizarding world of muggles (humans) and mudbloods (wizards with some human ancestors). By exploring a kind of ethnic cleansing within a wizardly setting the movie presents a lesson in tolerance. ""Lucius believes his own race is superior"" says English actor Jason Isaacs who plays the despicable character. ""You dont need to go back in time to Hitler. There are plenty of people getting elected all over that are terrified of change. There are the recent anti-asylum and anti-immigration movements that political parties seem to be acting on. ""If Lucius were American hed be running around with a pillowcase on his head."" But its not all scary morality tale. Secrets also offers more laughs and characters are better developed. Both filmmakers and actors display a greater assurance with the material. Radcliffe himself noticed the difference ""I am much more confident with the filmmaking process and would often discuss ideas with Chris Columbus which I would not have a year ago. The atmosphere was more relaxed because we knew each other very well and felt comfortable in the world."" Says Columbus ""Dans an incredibly bright serious person and he has taken the time to work on his craft day after day for two years so hes really become much more professional. All the kids were more confident in their performing."" In the first movie the initial 45 minutes dealt mostly with exposition and introduction of the characters. Secrets is more of an action film and newcomers -- especially Branaghs narcissistic Lockhart -- are fully formed rather than simply introduced and discarded. And filmmakers added their own touches to the story. Lucius for example mistreats his son Draco which shows the origins and motivations behind the boys bullying behavior. And Columbus suggested that Radcliffe deliver one line in the subtly swaggering style of a young Clint Eastwood rather than the less dramatic verbal confrontation in the book. After Lucius says sarcastically ""Lets hope Mr. Potter is always around to save the day"" Radcliffe asserts ""Dont worry. I will be."" The sequel also sets up the audience ever so subtly for the third Potter movie with a reference to Azkaban prison. That film --Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which starts shooting in March -- will again likely be dark and frightening. Towering demonic presences known as dementors menace Harry ""draining peace hope and happiness out of the air around them."" But on a lighter note the remedy for their efforts is chocolate. (Raisinets tie-in anyone?) The third installment will usher in several new challenges for the series Replacing a key character. Septuagenarian Richard Harris who played Hogwarts wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore died just weeks ago. (A stand-in is said to have taken his place on days he was too sick to work.) A rumored front-runner to take over the role is said to be Christopher Lee most recently seen in Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and a villain in the upcoming The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers. But matching Harris spirit will be difficult. ""The kids were very shocked at his death"" Branagh says. ""They loved him. The line between fiction and reality was rather blurred in their relationship. When they were around him on set he was like a compassionate wise old uncle. They all felt really safe around him. He had a kindly presence."" Bringing on a new director. Alfonso Cuaron (A Little Princess Y Tu Mama Tambien) takes over though Columbus will be on set daily as producer. The kids will be 14 and producer David Heyman has said Cuarons ability to direct teenagers as exhibited in Tu Mama shows ""that he knows what the intense time is like."" But Columbus has been fiercely protective of the children believing that kids still need to be kids. Spreading release dates. The third movie is scheduled for summer 2004 instead of next November. Columbus says more time is needed to accommodate the complex story and acquaint Cuaron with the material. That shift could harm the momentum gained by opening Stone and Secrets just a year apart and at the start of the popular holiday filmgoing season. And the dark magical world seems less suited to summer when lighter fare dominates. Waiting for the book. Secrets hits theaters more than two years since the last Potter novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire reached bookstores. The existing Potter quartet (though still on best-seller lists) has had some heavyweight competition from books such as Lemony Snickets Series of Unfortunate Events also being made into a movie and possibly spurring its own franchise. Rowlings long-awaited fifth book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is scheduled for publication next year. It reportedly is even longer than Goblet of Fire which was a weighty 742 pages. Rowling recently said she is just weeks away from finishing but there are those who believe she might never write the last two. Passing of time. The young stars could outgrow their roles by the fourth movie. ""Temperamentally I think they would continue"" Branagh says. ""But time may catch up. Maybe theyll just get too big or their physical growth will outstrip the characters."" In the meantime the kids are clearly still enjoying even marveling over their stardom. ""The oddest thing was seeing myself as a Lego action figure"" Radcliffe says. ""It was so strange seeing my cylindrical head.""

It had he said ""a bit of action a bit of fear a bit of bravery and a bit of embarrassment."" To this astute observers words (full disclosure Hes my 7-year-old nephew and a fount of information on all things Potter) I can only add that its also got a bit of magic and more than a bit of charm. No sequelitis here kids (and grown-ups) -- this franchise is alive and well. And like the apple-red Hogwarts train its speeding full steam ahead toward adolescence with rather more grace than the journey normally entails. The ""embarrassment"" alluded to by my nephew comes late in the film when two near-teens suddenly feel the tiniest blush of squirrelly attraction. Its a subtle moment but signifies -- along with the up-and-down wanderings of the young male casts voices -- that hormones may soon be raging in the halls of Hogwarts. Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith with her lips ever-pursed) spends most of this film looking terribly worried; perhaps in addition to fretting about the forces of evil shes anticipating chaperoning the spring dance. But changes are welcome in this magical world as the fairest criticism that can be leveled against the second ""Harry Potter"" movie is that its an awful lot like the first one. Young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe looking a bit lankier) is rescued from his nasty aunt and uncle only to find signs of dark forces at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with which he and pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must grapple. John Williams whimsical theme music is back as is virtually all of the original cast and settings. All this familiarity is comforting for the many who loved ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" -- just seeing the firelit Gryffindor Common Room again is a cozy pleasure -- but doesnt bode well for a planned seven-movie franchise. Subtle signs of change though are on the horizon and its not just Hermiones once-wild hair (she appears to have discovered some sort of smoothing gel during the school break). Director Chris Columbus -- who does good work here but is showing a bit too much reliance on charming wide-smile close-ups of his young stars -- is stepping down after two movies. Alfonso Cuaron who made the enchanting 1995 childrens film ""A Little Princess"" (and the zesty for-grown-ups-only comedy ""Y tu mama tambien"" earlier this year) will direct ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" which goes into production next year for a summer 2004 release. But never mind the future -- the film that arrives on screen this week (with refreshingly less hype than last year) has more than its share of enchantment. Radcliffe Grint and Watson more comfortable this time around interact with the ease of old friends. Robbie Coltranes kind giant Hagrid and Alan Rickmans bone-white Professor Snape are a welcome sight as is Smiths crotchety professor and Julie Walters bubbly ginger-haired mama witch Mrs. Weasley. Kenneth Branagh as the foppish new teacher Gilderoy Lockhart gives perhaps his loosest silliest performance ever Hes constantly adjusting himself for the best possible camera angle grinning as if to expose as many pearly-white teeth as possible. Shirley Henderson (""Topsy-Turvy"" ""Bridget Joness Diary"") her voice sounding like shes inhaled a very British type of helium joins the cast as Moaning Myrtle a pigtailed ghost who lurks in the girls bathroom. Jason Isaacs is nicely slithery as Lucius Malfoy father of Harrys blond nemesis Draco (Tom Felton looking more and more like some kind of junior albino vampire). And Richard Harris who died last month of cancer at the age of 72 is the picture of kindness and wisdom as beloved headmaster Albus Dumbledore in his final screen performance. In one poignant scene he explains to Harry why his lovely phoenix bird is now ashes ""They burst into flame when it is time for them to die and then they are reborn."" The cavernous halls of Hogwarts are as populated as ever (though Id like to see John Cleeses Nearly Headless Nick get a little more screen time) and a few new settings are tantalizingly revealed. We get a quick peek at the Weasleys house looking like an upside-down Victorian pile and at the school potting shed where mandrake roots -- squealing like evil babies -- are repotted. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is definitely a darker movie than its predecessor -- words are written on a wall in blood; creepy-crawly giant spiders menace our heroes; and theres more talk of murder than last time around.

Starring Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint and Kenneth Branagh. Directed by Chris Columbus. (VHS and DVD. PG. 161 minutes.) ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is designed for a specific audience that just happens to number in the gazillions -- people who love the ""Harry Potter"" novels. As such its not a regular movie so much as a visual guide to an experience that viewers have already had inside their own heads. That puts a huge weight of responsibility on director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves and this time the weight suffocates their movie. Scenes that should have been cut are included so as not to disappoint anyone. What could have been a small sweet and genuinely scary film is instead a full hour too long and many millions too fat. The sequel finds Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) living with his dreaded Aunt (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle (Richard Griffiths) and counting the days until summer is over and he can go back to Hogwarts to start his second year of magic school. Thats when Dobby a house elf shows up -- a beautifully realized computer creation -- and warns him not to return to school that something terrible is about to happen. Harry and his best friends -- Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) -- return to Hogwarts only to discover that something terrible and mysterious is going on. Students and animals are turning up petrified literally. A secret chamber has been opened and an unseen monster has been set loose whose goal is to kill students who are not full-blooded wizards. This sets in motion what is essentially an action-movie story which the movie elongates and pumps up in the usual blockbuster fashion. The worst example of excess is an extended scene in which Harry and Ron have to escape a dark cave populated by thousands of man-eating spiders. With just the slightest alteration of the story the scene could have been eliminated -- and it should have been. Its in the light magical touches that ""The Chamber of Secrets"" shines. When the spiders are attacking (or later a giant snake) its just a regular sci-fi movie with standard-issue effects. Kenneth Branagh is the one human thing in the movie thats delightful. He plays Gilderoy Lockhart a self-loving professor of the dark arts with a perfect bouffant of blond hair and a winning smile. He has no real talent for magic but lots of talent for fraud and self-promotion. Watching Branagh as Lockhart continually backpedaling and covering for his ineptitude is the one surefire funny thing in the movie. Other big names in the cast have no opportunities to stand out. The late Richard Harris lends weariness and grandeur to the role of headmaster Dumbledore but Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman barely register. Indeed its striking that for all the British talent assembled here (it has an all- British cast) the movie hardly seems English in atmosphere or mood. Theres no feeling of history no sense of mystery no smell of wood smoke in the air. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is like old English leather that has been transformed into American plastic as shiny as a toy on Christmas morning. And about as lasting. Its the world of ""Harry Potter"" that makes the books special and this time that world doesnt come through. -- Advisory This film contains mild scenes of violence and mayhem.

"Its A Harry Situation - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections Its A Harry SituationMovies - REVIEW - Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsThe Potter Film Potion Is A Few Frogs Shy Of Magic But It Is Getting Better.November 15 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticThat flying Ford Anglia you may have spotted overhead doesnt run on flubber.Powered by magic its just one among many mystical wonders youll discover in the second Harry Potter film which opens today.Yes Muggles the daring young wizard with the lightning-bolt scar and the round wire-rim glasses is back on the silver screen in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.And this time he and his friends are fighting to save their beloved Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Harry and his carrot-topped sidekick Ron Weasley decide to fly that car to Hogwarts when a mysterious force causes them to miss their enchanted train at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. And thats only one of the inexplicable obstacles that our heroes encounter in this installment.Menacing spiders an angry tree and a giant snake must also be overcome if Harry and Co. are ever to unlock the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. An obstacle of another sort is the terminally vain Gilderoy Lockhart the schools new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and author of the self-serving autobiography Magical Me.Like the first film last years Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone the new one isnt as magical as it ought to be. It doesnt so much spark your imagination as it simply satisfies some of your curiosity about what Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has already imagined.The upside is that within that limited approach the new film is smoother and more entertaining than Sorcerers Stone. The whole Harry Potter thing may not be as fresh for moviegoers as it was last year but thankfully Chamber of Secrets is well-crafted.That flying car and the scenes that contain it have a marvelous magic-carpet-ride spirit. Returning director Chris Columbus and his team put you right in the drivers seat.And speaking of flying theyve also managed to create a Quidditch match that is both coherent and exciting a distinct improvement over the choppily edited match in film No. 1. As Harry and the other players dart through the air on their broomsticks in what resembles an airborne game of lacrosse you want to cheer them on.Other effects such as the ones responsible for a floppy-eared pronoun-averse ""house elf"" and emerald-flamed fireplace-style transporting are delightful. Simultaneously delightful and repulsive are the scenes in which Ron bedeviled by a spell gone wrong spits up a series of slimy slugs.Warning to kids Hold off on the popcorn until this scene has passed.Daniel Radcliffe who was notably unassuming in the first film often takes command here to offer a more classically heroic version of Harry. Rupert Grint as Ron has expanded his range of amusing horrified expressions while young Emma Watson as the studiously magical Hermione Granger has perhaps mellowed a tad.Shes still smart as a whip but shes not quite so self-satisfied about it. Self-satisfaction is generally left to the comically insufferable Gilderoy played with panache and a pile of hair by Kenneth Branagh.Among the other adults on hand are Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith as the scowling Professor Snape and the starchy Professor McGonagall with Robbie Coltrane as the bushy-faced gentle-giant Hagrid and Julie Walters as Rons watchful mom. The cast also includes Jason Isaacs and Tom Felton as Lucius and Draco Malfoy a father-and-son team of fascists John Cleese as the spectral Nearly Headless Nick and Bonnie Wright as Rons kid sister Ginny.Richard Harris who died last month returns as Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in a performance that is reported to have been augmented by the use of a double because of the actors illness at the time of filming. Nevertheless snowy-bearded Dumbledore comes off as a kindly-wily cross between Merlin and Santa.Chamber of Secrets has a sagging midsection. Once again screenwriter Steve Kloves is so faithful to Rowlings narrative that he includes too much of it. A gracefully shaped screenplay would be more selective.But if the accumulation of plot detail may sometimes strain an adults patience literal-minded kids will be grateful that so little is left out. And kids except the most sensitive ones will probably get a kick out of the fun-house frights in this scarier-than-the-original sequel.According to Rowlings grand plan there will ultimately be seven Harry Potter books and presumably seven Harry Potter films. That film No. 2 is better than film No. 1 is a good sign as well as a bit of a rarity in the world of movies.At the rate these films are improving film No. 7 may be a classic.

The new Harry Potter movie is -- ho hum -- more of the same. The first film Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone turned out to be an impressive feat an immaculate translation of a much-loved book. Its makers lacked vision but so what? They made the movie fans wanted to see. This time we know exactly what well get. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is crammed with action special effects and all sorts of wondrous and frightful creatures just like the first film. The Potter series has already become a reliable product like roll-on deodorant or nasal spray. It gets the job done but its hard to get as excited this time around. This movie like the first is more of a translation than an adaptation. Its the visual equivalent of an audio book slightly abridged. The second installment of J.K. Rowlings novel series follows young Harry during his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Once again his arch nemesis the evil wizard Voldemort spreads terror. Once again Harry is the hero of the Quidditch field and the snobbish Draco Malfoy glowers menacingly whenever Harry or his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are around. A monster resides at Hogwarts. It is paralyzing students and pets one by one. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is always the first on the scene and predictably keeps getting blamed. Students whose parents are both Muggles (nonmagical humans) or who are of mixed parentage -- students such as Hermione (Emma Watson) -- are in danger. A strain of bigotry grows apparent as Malfoy and his father -- a new character -- voice ever more blatant anti-Muggle sentiments. The poster for this film is darker and spookier than the first. The film is too but not greatly. How dark can a movie be that features such slapstick as cakes falling on peoples heads? There also is a cute bit with a flying car that appears magically to save the day like Silver responding to the Lone Rangers whistle. The cake stunt is the work of a new animated character Dobby. Hes a neurotic eager-to-please elf who functions like a diminutive version of Phantom Menace sidekick Jar-Jar Binks but without the Rastafarian accent. The most noteworthy new character is Gilderoy Lockhart played by Kenneth Branagh. Hes the amusingly vain and cowardly new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Many of the most thrilling or fun scenes are also the most superfluous. Much of the first hour seems to exist to wow us rather than to advance the story. For instance Harry and Ron ride the flying car that crashes into a giant enchanted tree that gives them a good whomping. This is a fine scene but a series of small calamities leads up to it. Harry almost falls out of the car for example and then the car is almost run over by a train. Children who want to luxuriate in Harrys world as long as possible will love all this faux excitement. But itll have the rest of us fidgeting in our seats. For some of those kids the intensity of the last half might be hard to take. Harry and Ron encounter legions of hungry giant spiders. And Harry does battle with a gigantic snake with fangs the size of baseball bats. Chris Columbus returning as director orchestrates things crisply but its good to know the next film in the series will get a new director.

"Sophomore year at Hogwarts. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sophomore year at Hogwarts. Sophomore year at Hogwarts. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 14 2002 639 PM Goody-Two-Brooms Sophomore year at Hogwarts. By David Edelstein Good-natured Harry battles Draco on the Quidditch field Its sophomore year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the air is thick with menace. Someone or something is trying to drive Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) away perhaps the same person (or entity) who has opened the ""Chamber of Secrets"" a hidden vault containing a monster that petrifies (literally) ""mudblood"" students--those born of one or more ""muggle"" parent. Could it be the work of the indefatigable anti-miscegenist Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) father of that Syltherin snotnose Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton)? Or is this comeback No. 2 of the dread Lord Voldemort? Advertisement All very eventful. But the major occurrence in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Warner Bros.) is ... puberty. Where did the cute boy soprano from Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone (2001) go? Only a month or two of summer is supposed to have passed since freshman year Is this stringy whey-faced baritone really Our Little Wizard? As I sat through this sequel--which is more entertaining than the first film but still two hours and 40 minutes--with no bathroom breaks Mom and Dad--I passed the time wondering if AOL Time Warner had thought to protect its investment with computer simulations of Radcliffe Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) over the next decade. What will these tykes look like on the other side of the Great Adolescent Divide? For a lot of child actors the early teens arent pretty Those marvelous features have a tendency to grow at different rates. (Even the comeliest kids have weird stuff happen to them. Remember when all you could register on the face of Brooke Shields was her new Frankenstein brow?) Given the billions at stake is someone at the studio monitoring these kids hormones? Are there dermatologists on call night and day? Were talking sixsequels folks. A movie about the care and feeding of the child stars of Harry Potter would be more entertaining than the thing itself. It would have some real life in it. I write that as someone who treasures J.K. Rowlings Potter books and feels there is plenty of real life in them to harvest. While its true as Chris Suellentrop has suggested in a lively Slate takedown that Harry is something of a fast-food hero--an opportunistic blend of nerd-outsider and jock-celebrity--he is also our way into a richly imagined alternate universe. Even in the homogenized Hogwarts there are hints of rage toward the English ""muggle"" world for its repressive good taste its vicious civility. And Harrys powers are no less earned than those of Clark Kent a superhero for no reason other than his Krypton DNA or Luke Skywalker whose affinity for the Force is surely a genetic bequest from Dear Old Darth. (Batman is often cited as the most self-made superhero but he could never have fashioned that particular persona without a whopping inheritance.) The Potter mythology might prove to be even more complex than those above Increasingly Harry may be seen as less the creation of his murdered parents than of their murderer who gave the baby some of his own fearsome power along with that lightning-bolt scar. The late Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore Suellentrop also argues that because of Harrys innate gifts Dumbledores final homily--that ones destiny is not a matter of ones abilities but ones choices--is specious. But Harry can be a good caretaker of his talent or a bad one. The real dramatic problem at least to date is that theres no indication he might ever be tempted by the ""Slytherin"" side of his nature. For all the trauma of his childhood Harry is stupefyingly good-natured. Advertisement The same might be said of director Chris Columbus who in the last movie brought little to his work beyond an eagerness to please his corporate masters. This time at least he seems committed to thrilling the kiddies even more Chamber of Secrets is darker and scarier with lots more incident and several of the set pieces have a Spielbergian kick. When Harry and Ron fly their magic Ford Anglia into a giant gnarly tree with the witty name of ""The Whomping Willow"" it flings the car around and bashes in the doors and windows. The sequence ends with a hilarious button when the Ford ejects the two boys and plunges huffily into the dark forest--it would rather live feral than be commandeered by male adolescents. The redheaded Rupert Grint as Ron is maturing into a wonderful clown When a talking spider thats literally (pace Woody Allen) the size of a Buick cues a furious arach attack the spiders are upstaged by Grints Stan Laurel-like cringing--by that mouth that spread in fear threatens to swallow his entire face. The plusses in this film come close to overwhelming the Christmassy blandness that dogs Columbus work. There is an effusive new computer-generated creature--a stick-figure elf--called Dobby who could easily have emerged as the seasons most egregious Jar-Jar-like irritant. But as scripted by Steve Kloves and animated by Jim Mitchell and Nick Davis hes a gruesomely determined self-flagellator. Mildly rebuked by Harry he will bash his head furiously against wooden drawers or announce he needs to iron his hand Hes a merchandisable extension of the underclass element that gravitates to masochism over revolt. And every time Kenneth Branagh saunters onto the screen as the braggart Gilderoy Lockhart--celebrated author and Defense Against the Dark Arts professor--the movie goes into a Shakespearean comic sphere. With his hair swept up and his toasty plummy tones his Lockhart is a lyrically self-infatuated fool--abetted in several delirious scenes by animated portraits of himself twinkling back at him. Branaghs genius almost distracts you from the fact that this billion-dollar English cast has been otherwise criminally frittered away. Thanks to her voice with its weird helium-infused sensuality Shirley Henderson makes an impression as a ghost who haunts the ladies loo. But Alan Rickman who nearly walked off with the last film as the sour Professor Snape resembles here a tired queeny refugee from a Greenwich Village Halloween parade. Robbie Coltranes Hagrid is at one point carted off to a horrific prison--even so he has no chance to deepen the portrait he established in Sorcerors Stone. And what kind of director could confine the greatest living English-language comedienne Maggie Smith to a few blase reaction shots? What kind of director could confine the most resourceful of all living British farceurs John Cleese to a couple of monosyllabic drift-throughs as a semi-decapitated ghost? A director with more money than talent. It might not matter that Chamber of Secrets goes on for so long except that Columbus storytelling is so unvaried. Because he has these vast sets to show off he starts nearly every major scene from on high dollying down to the level of the characters. His wand is his wad. Columbus pacing is metronomical with no shot held for more than a couple of beats. When one of the major characters is found petrified--out of commission for the rest of the movie and a huge loss--he doesnt linger for a second longer than he needs to to make his narrative point. When in the coming weeks you see Steven Soderberghs Solaris (opening Nov. 27) youll see how a great and personal director can turn a cheesy sci-fi scenario into a profound threnody of grief. Chris Columbus takes great and personal themes and makes them almost inconsequential. Advertisement Heres the tidy truth about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Given everything that happens in Rowlings story its not long enough. This isnt a two-hour film inflated by pretension (or contractual fidelity) to two hours and 40 minutes; its a four-hour film reduced by a businesslike hack to two-thirds of its rightful length. I cant think of a movie this long that has left me so starved for a movie. The best news is that Columbus has sailed from England for the New World. The director of the third Harry Potter film will be Alfonso Cuaron who--as I said in my review of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone--would have been the ideal choice to begin with. Cuaron who directed the modern childrens classic A Little Princess (1995) and the horny teen classic Y Tu MamaTambien (2001) wont start from high above the sets and find his way to the characters. Hell start with the emotions and dolly his way to the myth. Just like J.K. Rowling. Note Thirty or so readers have castigated me (some very Draco Malfoy-like indeed) in e-mails for calling this Harrys ""sophomore year"" instead of his ""second year."" This is a seven-year program Im informed by Brits and others which begins in what Americans would call seventh grade and continues to graduation. Harrys sophomore year by Yank lights would be 10th grade--which means Volume 5 which J.K. Rowling has yet to publish. According to my Websters unabridged one of three definitions of sophomore (Greek sophos wise and moros foolish) is ""a person in his second year of any enterprise; as Senator Brown is a sophomore in Congress.""

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 15 2002 1200AM EST Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 139AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Directed by Chris Columbus Written by Steve Kloves Starring Daniel Radcliffe Kenneth Branagh Richard Harris Maggie Smith Classification PG Rating  Were off to see the wizard again and I couldnt be more excited -- theres nothing like another Harry Potter movie to stir up the big kid in me. Gone sadly is much of the happy hysteria that surrounded the appearance of the first picture -- has it really been a year ago? And gone too but certainly not missed is Richard Muggles the pathetic curmudgeon who -- Im sure youve forgotten -- used to hold down the film critics job on these very pages. In fact it was Muggless mingy review of the initial Potter flick that steamed his bosses and led to his so-called early retirement. Actually the old coot was canned to make room for me and not a moment too soon -- this is a young mans game. However generous to a fault I decided to bounce one more of my fresh ideas off my grateful editors Why not roust Muggles from his nursing home and have him accompany me to the screening of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets? As I patiently explained (these editors are getting on in years themselves) the idea was a nifty reversal of the usual practice. Critics are always bringing kids to movies like this then eavesdropping on their kiddie reactions. Not me. Id do just the opposite. Yep Id be off to see the wizard with my very own geezer. Well to make a long story short I picked up Muggles during visiting hours bundled him in his cloak fetched his cane and drove merrily on to my favourite downtown multiplex. The lights dimmed the title credits rolled I bounced on the edge of my seat while Muggles slumped in his threatening to doze until I started putting that cane to good use. Two-and-a-half hours of unadulterated fun later it was all over and we headed off (""Repaired"" Muggles muttered) to a nearby coffee shop. There fuelled by a latte with triple milk he revived somewhat and notes were compared. Might as well listen in Me ""You had to love it Rich. This was even better than the first one and Ill tell you why. Four little words Less talk more action. "" Muggles ""Dear boy you miss the point once again. What you refer to as less talk is actually a dearth of exposition -- the very exposition which gave the original what charm it had. There dont you see the orphaned Master Potter was but an inchoate wizard and thus like his surrogates in the audience viewed everything for the first time through an innocent eye -- the injustice of his foster parents the Victorian charms of the Hogwarts Academy the professors and students kindly and cruel his fumbling attempts to master the magic wand of experience the rough schoolboy sports the villains class-consciousness all those watered-down Dickensian tropes that the books author J. K. Rowling so cleverly . . ."" Me ""Enough of your damn literary references. Nobody misses them. Sure Rowling may be getting kids to read books again but only so they can take the much more rewarding step of seeing the movie version. And Rich a movie has to move and this one does right out of the chute. I mean how does Harry travel to Hogwarts this time? Not by a musty train but in a flying car. Big improvement straight off. And when he arrives theres much less idle chatter. Just cue the special effects. Like those Cornish pixies that flit about like giant blue mosquitoes. And the small rodents that get turned into water goblets except one kids wand misfires and the glass ends up with a stringy tale. That was funny. And what about Professor Dumbledores phoenix rising so majestically from its own ashes."" Muggles ""T. S. Eliot uses that very image to wondrous advantage in . . ."" Me ""And when the Chamber of Secrets finally opens and Harry and his buddies follow those creepy insects into the lair of the humungous mother spider. And the Basilisk the giant snake with its sharp serpents tooth. Thats some deliciously scary stuff and very nicely engineered here. Chris Columbus -- the director not the one you knew -- is proving that practice does make perfect. Even the quidditch scene -- you remember that aerial rugby game -- is much zippier this time out. As for the cast you cant have any complaint there."" Muggles ""I do confess to favouring young Daniel Radcliffe in the title role."" Me ""Yeah Radcliffes fine. My dad tells me that in his granny glasses the kid looks a lot like one of those dead Beatles. But I was talking about all the old Brits in the cast. Theyre back and they must really appeal to your generation -- Maggie Smith Alan Rickman Robbie Coltrane Richard Harris."" Muggles ""The late . . . "" Me ""No you wont be late. I promised the nurses Id have you home by tea. ""Anyway theres also a brilliant acting addition here in Kenneth Branagh as the ultra-vain Professor Lockhart. You know I once had a pompous poof of a prof just like him way back in 98 in my last year at J-school."" Muggles ""Did I ever mention that the truly revelatory thing about Branaghs unabridged Hamlet was . . . "" Me ""Rich youre wandering again."" Muggles ""Indeed. More to the point then let me counter your effusive praise with a question that can only be considered rhetorical. Between those kinetic outbursts you so admire did you not find the plot a tad murky and the denouement positively lumbering?"" Me ""No and no. At least not to anyone who bothered to stay awake. If youd been more alert you might have picked up on the neat moral of the picture which youll agree applies to every last one of us Its not our abilities which show us what we truly are but our choices. "" Muggles ""I choose to go home now."" Me ""Wrong again old friend. I choose to take you."" And so I did making polite small talk -- have I mentioned my generous nature? -- on the drive back. Bone weary by now Muggles offered little in reply. Except once. Just as we reached the home and before hobbling out of the car he suddenly got all animated and with an energy that seemed to surprise even him burst out ""Look. I grant you its a film that will serve the Potter franchise well that will not disappoint either youngsters or their parents and that bears the markings of its solid studio craftsmanship -- worthy performances credible effects competent direction. However despite such stalwart craft theres a missing element whose absence forgive me I cant help but lament. This is a movie about magic that ultimately lacks the magic of movies."" At least thats what I think he said. Frankly I was paying more attention to his face which had grown alarmingly red from the effort of saying so much about so little. Then he got out and I watched an old man totter down the walkway to his rest. Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets ) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (United States/United Kingdom 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres no question that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is designed more for fans of the book than for those who have never picked up a J.K. Rowling tome. However while that makes sense financially (after all the target audience represents those children and adults who have gobbled up the novels) it opens up some questions about the creative side of things. The second Harry Potter movie is a fun fantastic adventure but watching it I had the sense that it could have been even better than it is. I was diverted and entertained but never truly absorbed. The problem as it was with the previous movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a slavish faithfulness to the book. Nearly every minor plot element and scene has been retained (although the few absences such as the ""Deathday Party"" will no doubt anger some fans) leading to a lot of largely irrelevant tangents and a running length that exceeds the first movies two and one-half hours. Sequences (chiefly of the character-building variety) that work well on the written page do not always fare as strongly in a motion picture and that is the case here. One must remember that novels and cinema are different media. Some of the best movie adaptations do not adhere rigorously to the authors text. The first hour of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets occasionally feels sluggish and prone to aimless wandering. After that once the main story kicks into high gear the film comes across as better focused and faster paced a at least until the last quarter-hour and the seemingly endless denouement. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets opens up with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) joining his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) and his nemesis Draco (Tom Felton) as they prepare to begin their sophomore year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Many of the old professors and administrators are back including headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris in his final role) the strict Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and the dark unwelcoming Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Theres also a newcomer a the charismatic self-absorbed Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) who is more concerned with answering fan mail than teaching how to defend against the dark arts. But all is not well at Hogwarts. A dark plot is brewing with someone planning to break into the legendary ""Chamber of Secrets"" and unleash a monster that can petrify or kill with a look. Its up to Harry and his two friends to uncover the individual behind the plot and foil him or her before Hogwarts is closed. All of the true inspiration underlying Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets lies in J.K. Rowlings writing. The Harry Potter books dont break new barriers but they mix long-accepted fantasy formulas into a mA(c)lange that is fresh easygoing and infectious. Some of that comes across in the movies but there are times when director Chris Columbus pedestrian filmmaking lacks the spark that would truly ignite a movie. Columbus doesnt take a single chance. As a result there are times when Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets seems more like a pre-packaged product than a living breathing motion picture. It satisfies but does not overwhelm. The films high octane second half is vastly better than the fitfully entertaining opening 75 minutes. All of the memorable scenes occur late in the movie including an amazingly realized sequence featuring a bunch of large unfriendly spiders and an equally eye-popping battle with a giant snake. These scenes with their flawless CGI special effects dwarf even the most impressive sequence from the first movie. The films other big effect is the computer-generated Dobby the House Elf who simultaneously manages to be little more convincing and a little less annoying than Jar-Jar Binks. The trio of young actors a Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint a is back. Each of the young stars gives a more confident and polished performance than in his or her previous outing. One hopes the filmmakers will be able to stay with these performers for at least another one or two outings. (Age may eventually become a factor since future movies are not projected to arrive annually.) The best of the newcomers is expectedly Kenneth Branagh who sinks his teeth into playing the preening supercilious Gilderoy Lockhart. Branagh has been keeping a low profile in the past few years a its nice to see him explode back into the limelight with something this enjoyable. The other notable addition is Jason Issacs who plays Dracos father Lucius. Isaacs radiates pure evil and theres little doubt that he will become a formidable adversary for Harry in future episodes. As a companion piece to Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets makes for effective viewing. The second film may be a little darker than the first but the two pictures mesh perfectly a not surprising considering that many of the same people were responsible for both. Creatively the movie has its flaws but those will be ignored in the impending inescapable box office tidal wave. It will be interesting to see where the series goes from here with director Columbus leaving and the next book Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban being too long for the kind of direct regurgitation that marked the first two outings. One can only hope the result will be as good as if not better than its predecessors.

Rowlings marvelous series into a deadly bore. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Harry Potter Movies Entertainment News When a movie is touted and treated as an event long before it even reaches the theaters can it ever become a movie again? In the case of ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" the second installment of the film franchise based on the hugely successful (and wonderful) series of books by J.K. Rowling the answer is no. By now were all used to heavy marketing campaigns for movies. But movies that actually feel like two-hour-plus marketing campaigns are a relatively new phenomenon. Perfunctory competent well-oiled and yet still stultifyingly dull ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" sells itself dutifully minute-by-minute -- its the hardest-working movie in show business. Its also an example of the most dispiriting and dangerous trend in contemporary Hollywood filmmaking. ""Chamber of Secrets"" was clearly made with the utmost care (and plenty of money) yet it simply withers before us like a choked-off mandrake plant. Its starved for the one moviemaking resource that doesnt cost a lot of money imagination. Its frustrating that ""Chamber of Secrets"" is actually an improvement on the first ""Harry Potter"" movie. For one thing it starts out with more wit and life than its predecessor -- the movies early gags carry you along fooling you into thinking you might actually be swept into the movie. (One of the early scenes features a nicely levitating cake that ends up splooshed on the head of a la-de-da dinner guest and it takes a crankier person than I am to resist that sort of thing.) Some of the special effects are lovely ""Chamber of Secrets"" marks the appearance of Dobby a wrinkled elfin slave creature who can appear and disappear instantaneously. When he snaps his fingers he dissolves into ripply streaks of smoke that echo his wrinkly skin. And ""Chamber of Secrets"" doesnt have the chintzy Hogwarts-from-a-shopping-cart look that its predecessor had; shot by Roger Pratt (""The End of the Affair"") its bathed in a softer sometimes spectral light making it look less garish and cartoony than the first movie. The pictures gloomier sheen suits the story ""Chamber of Secrets"" is a darker and more ominous tale than ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone."" ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been carefully made all right. But none of it unfortunately adds up to a better movie. Like ""Sorcerers Stone"" ""Chamber of Secrets"" follows the plot of Rowlings book precisely picking the story up at the very beginning of Harrys second term at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry the place he has come to call home. (Harry is again played by Daniel Radcliffe a restrained and serviceable if unmemorable actor.) But before that fresh term can begin there are two immediate obstacles Dobby has shown up to warn him that he must under no circumstances return to Hogwarts or hell be in grave danger. And Harrys nasty Muggle guardians the Dursleys (again played by Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths) have locked him in his room to prevent him from returning to the school. Luckily his pal Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint whose tireless if well-intentioned mugging becomes wearisome in the movies first hour and nearly unbearable in its second) swings by to pick him up in the Weasley familys airbound auto. After a few false starts Harry finally finds himself once again at Hogwarts. There he rejoins the classmates he loves like the adorable nerdy-girl Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) as well as those he despises like the devious Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton who acts as if hes learned everything he knows about hammy villainy from Little Rascals shorts). Hes also thrust into a very dangerous adventure A mysterious hidden chamber has been opened at Hogwarts and the beast who lives in it is out for blood. It would be a helpful but boring experiment to watch ""Chamber of Secrets"" with the book its based on and a flashlight in hand comparing page-by-page the events that take place in the novel with what director Chris Columbus has put on-screen. I dont think youd find much digression or much editing ""Chamber of Secrets"" as adapted by screenwriter Steve Kloves is a filmic replica of its source material and thats a huge part of the problem. We all know that the experience of reading is vastly different from that of watching. But Columbus and Kloves seem to be trying to re-create the experience of reading instead of shaping Rowlings story into a movie with its own sense of rhythm and pacing. Rowlings books are rich thrillingly episodic and Dickensian both in the way the stories unfold and in the vast array of colors she uses to shade her characters. But Columbus doesnt understand the difference between adaptation and painstaking translation He moves along from plot point to plot point as if he were filling in a giant sheet of graph paper. Now Harry Ron and Hermione will consume a potion that will allow them to take the forms of some of their fellow classmates; now Harry and Ron will visit a giant spiders lair; now professor Dumbledores phoenix will shed a tear with healing powers -- and so on. You Might Also Like The result is that even though the narrative is faithfully detailed few (if any) of those details capture our imaginations. After its deceptively fleet opening 20 minutes or so ""Chamber of Secrets"" settles into a plodding amble a rickety framework in which many allegedly exciting things happen (students are turned into stone by a mysterious and evil monster; the Weasleys floating car shows up unexpectedly to bail Ron and Harry out of a terrifying scrape) and are forgotten only minutes later. The connect-the-dots storytelling of ""Chamber of Secrets"" also ends up swallowing the actors. Kenneth Branagh is perfectly cast as Gilderoy Lockhart the schools new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. You might call Lockhart the Cornel West of Hogwarts; hes the perfect embodiment of the glamour academic the fellow whos happy to sign copies of his books for his adoring admirers but who doesnt know (or care) enough about his specialty subject to be any good at teaching it to his students. Branagh plays Lockhart with lots of grand funny flourishes -- his lines seem meticulously articulated to match his artfully coiffed hair. The performance is a great in joke that riffs on the way Branagh is so intensely disliked at home in England (apparently hes viewed as a grammar schoolboy whos just too keen) and Branagh rides that joke like a motorized broomstick. Hes great fun to watch. But mostly the wonderful actors cast in this movie -- among them Maggie Smith as the stately professor McGonagall Robbie Coltrane as Hogwarts oversize and beloved groundskeeper Hagrid and Miriam Margolyes as the crumpet-shaped professor Sprout -- end up blurring into the movies background. Only the late Richard Harris as professor Dumbledore Hogwarts headmaster manages to distinguish himself -- he has only a handful of lines but he puts so much gravity in them and carries himself with so much careworn dignity that the picture glows with life whenever hes on-screen. Hes one of the few characters who actually seems to be living in the movie instead of just sweeping through it. Rowlings books are wonderful for many reasons not least because they understand how all of us adults and children alike yearn for a sense of community and belonging even as we long to set ourselves apart to feel that were loved and accepted not in spite of our oddities but because of them. Theyre also terrifically perceptive about the false hierarchies and prejudices that exist not just in the British school system but in schools everywhere -- or more accurately in societies everywhere. But they wouldnt be as loved or as successful as they are if they werent simply great stories with fascinating characters. ""Chamber of Secrets"" is discouraging not because it fails to recognize the power of Rowlings books -- it does -- but because Columbus perhaps knowing he cant match that power only bows and scrapes to it. If youre looking for the ""Movies can never live up to the books theyre based on"" argument you wont get it here. Examining how great books survive the transition from page to screen (or dont) is one of the deepest pleasures of moviegoing. And adapting a beloved book is one of the biggest and most interesting challenges a filmmaker can take on. But to make a great picture out of a great book you need a filmmaker whos more than just a footservant at the hands of a master -- you need an artist not a respectful lackey. The ""Harry Potter"" movies demand bravery delicacy imagination daring restraint -- a host of seemingly contradictory qualities. But those qualities can coexist and when they do you get magic. Directors like John Boorman who made the exuberant superbly mystical ""Excalibur"" or Alfonso Cuaron whose ""A Little Princess"" is one of the greatest adaptations of a childrens book ever made have already proven it. As luck would have it Warner Bros. has recently announced that Cuaron will direct the next installment in this series ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."" There in a nutshell is just one of the tantalizing promises that keeps us going to the movies. So far the ""Harry Potter"" franchise has proved to be a lifeless experiment in authenticity and faithfulness. But like Dumbledores fabulous phoenix Fawkes who burns to a pile of ash only to reappear as a huge and gorgeous creature with flame-red feathers it may yet carry us away.

Running time 161 minutes. Rated PG (scary scenes action violence). At the E-Walk the Cinema 1 the Union Square others. HARRY Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" proves that sometimes you can have too much of a good thing.Crammed full of labyrinthine plot twists this second installment will delight Potter-crazy kids even as their parents grow restless at the 2-hour-and-41-minute running time -9 minutes longer than the first film which wasnt exactly sprightly. It is also darker scarier and more special effects-driven - and only marginally less violent than the PG-13 ""Lord of the Rings"" whose older-skewing audience director Chris Columbus and the producers evidently covet. In other words its this series equivalent to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his pals Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) are back at Hogwarts for a second term and all heck is breaking loose. Messages are being written in blood on the walls a cat is hanged and students are being ""petrified"" by a mysterious monster from a hidden chamber whose entrance has never been discovered. Suspicion falls on Harry who may be descended from a long-ago wizard seduced by the dark side - shades of ""Star Wars"" - as well as on his nemesis Draco (Tom Felton) who has been promoted to seeker on his houses Quidditch team. Or is the creature-loving half-giant Hagrid (Robby Coltrane) responsible? To get to the answer you have to get past an endless Quidditch match and involved special-effects sequences centering around flying cars a massive snake an animated diary a ghost named Moaning Myrtle and a cave full of giant spiders. ""What was the point of sending us in there?"" Ron asks after the latter episode. Some grown-up Muggles will be asking the same question. On the plus side the three young leads are more assured in their roles even if the boys voices have dropped an octave or so. Richard Harris who died last month has more to do as kindly Headmaster Dumbledore though he looks alarmingly frail and his once-mighty voice is reduced to a hoarse whisper. There are lots of new characters besides returning stalwarts like Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) - and most of them dont really add anything but length. Kenneth Branagh has way too much footage as Gilderoy Lockhart the new egotistical Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Branagh out-hams even Alan Rickmans Professor Snape not to mention newcomer Jason Isaacs (""The Patriot"") as Dracos slimy Muggle-hating dad. But theyre benign compared to Dobby the House Elf who rivals Jar Jar Binks as a computer-generated annoyance. Screenwriter Steve Kloves still seems overly dedicated to cramming in every detail of J.K. Rowlings novel - while tacking on a schmaltzy Hollywood ending. While Kloves will be back the pedestrian Columbus has thankfully given up the directing reins for the next installment ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" which isnt due until the summer of 2004. Alfonso Cuaron who directed the wonderful ""A Little Princess"" as well as one of this years best movies (""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") seems likely to provide Harry with the sort of cinema magic thats in such short supply in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.""

"Dark magic - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW Dark magicNew Harry Potter may leave viewers bewitched but bothered and bewildered as well with its emphasis on the gruesome.November 15 2002|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is deja vu all over again and while that is a cliche nothing could be more appropriate. Its likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- youll likely think of this one. Still even partisans of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" may well be put off by parts of the new film.""Chamber of Secrets"" displays such zeal for re-creating the books more grotesque aspects from man-eating spiders to venom-dripping monster serpents that it is sure to rattle the cages of the smallest viewers sending them under their seats if not out of the theater.For the Harry Potter novels have a kind of magic that it is beyond the powers of these films to duplicate. The darkness that invades ""Chamber of Secrets"" underlines how well the books managed to exactly balance good and evil dark and light so that within their pages you seemed to be experiencing both at the same time. Not so here.Because ""Chamber of Secrets"" cant seem to get the balance right it ends up broadly overdoing things on both ends of the spectrum. The films scary moments are too monstrous and its happy times have too much idiotic beaming making the film feel like the illegitimate offspring of ""Alien"" and ""The Absent-Minded Professor.""Its fortunate that Alfonso Cuaron is set to take over the series from Chris Columbus and direct the next installment ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban;"" with Columbus in charge the J.K. Rowling books are fated never to get completely satisfying film versions. The original material is wonderful but whats clearer after two films than one is that Columbus cinematic treatments are unlikely to rise above the acceptable level of expensive copies to become truly memorable in their own right.""Chamber of Secrets"" like its predecessor is intelligently cast and makes good use of behind-the-camera talent like returning screenwriter Steve Kloves and new cinematographer Roger Pratt. And the problem has never been anyones intentions toward the material; ""Chambers"" two-hour 41-minute length shows that if anything the films are more concerned than they should be about leaving something out.To give the devil its further due ""Chamber"" has a bit of the magic of the Rowling originals mostly in its ability to reproduce some of the books peripheral tricks. Its amusing to see the Whomping Willow the screaming mandrake plants and the bad-tempered Howler sent by Mrs. Weasley to chastise the misbehaving Ron. Truly all that money can buy has been bought and though that is an accomplishment of a sort it is not great filmmaking.The acting in ""Chamber of Secrets"" is a similarly mixed bag. While it is charming to see how appropriately Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as inseparable pals Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have matured in a year the eagerness of Grints Weasley to continually make ""Little Rascals""-type faces is unfortunate.As for the adults Alan Rickman seems already tired of his role as Professor Snape while Maggie Smith appears to be getting more used to being Professor McGonagall. Of the newcomers who include Jason Isaacs as the villainous Lucius Malfoy the most satisfying acting is done by of all people Kenneth Branagh.As celebrity author Gilderoy Lockhart Hogwarts new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Branagh does some of his best film work in years bringing the same kind of pleasure to the part of a self-absorbed and fatuous fop that Robbie Coltrane brings to the stalwart giant Hagrid.The plot of ""Chamber"" begins when an annoying house-elf named Dobby pleads with Harry not to return to Hogwarts if he values his life. Once back at the school Harry and his pals have to contend with petrified fellow students and writings on the wall that ominously proclaim ""The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir Beware.""This all unfolds capably enough until the appearance of Aragog a 9-foot spider with an 18-foot leg span and a dreadful snake known as the Basilisk. To be fair these creatures appear in the book as well but it is one thing to read about them and another to actually see them on the big screen a difference the filmmakers without a sense of what is fitting in a film like this should have been sensitive to but were not.The most memorable moments in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" involve not some expensive special effect but the unplanned poignancy of Richard Harris performance the last of his long career as headmaster Albus Dumbledore.Perhaps as an acting choice perhaps because of the effects of the illness that eventually took his life Harris plays Dumbledore with a quavering but resolute frailty that gives the character an effective gravity. His speech about the life span of his beloved phoenix Fawkes one of those creatures that ""burst into flames when it is time for them to die"" provides an unintentional valedictory to an impressive career.Harry PotterMPAA rating PG for scary moments some creature violence and mild language.Times guidelines There are sequences that are more grotesque and scary than parents may expect.Daniel Radcliffe ...

In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets the too-long too-faithful adaptation (in a stick-in-the-mud sort of way) of the second J.K. Rowling book the English actor arrives at Hogwarts School playing a vain boastful charlatan of a professor. And guess what? Hes funny.Phew. After the scrupulously sober soulless reenactment that was last years inaugural Chris Columbus-directed Potter pic (what was it called again - Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Snooze?) the sequel at least boasts a few good chuckles. As Gilderoy Lockhart putative expert in the Defense Against the Dark Arts Branagh displays a head of excessively blond curly locks and a feel-good narcissism that makes his ultimate exposure as a pompous deceitful fool all the more satisfying.And did I say he was funny?The Chamber of Secrets begins with Master Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) older and froggier-voiced (look out here comes puberty) back at home among the ""muggles."" More specifically said muggles (thats humans to you and me) are the Dursleys - the pernicious uncle aunt and cousin who reluctantly took young Harry in after his parents died. No longer dwelling in the closet beneath the stairs Harrys been given a real bedroom but hes just as miserable no letters from his Hogwarts schoolmates no love from his adoptive family.Enter Dobby a nervous little house-elf who warns the budding wizard not to return to Hogwarts - his life is at risk. But when a flying car shows up outside the window driven by best friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) Harry wastes no time throwing himself his trunk and his pet owl into the vehicle. And off they go. The Chamber of Secrets - darker scarier and somewhat better than Sorcerers Stone - begins.Director Columbus long-ago mentoring at the hands of Steven Spielberg has left him with an incurable case of Phony Uplift and Manufactured Euphoria and The Chamber of Secrets suffers for it. (Symptoms include an overreliance on blustery John Williams scores a penchant for roller-coaster-like chase sequences and a surfeit of snakes spiders and sentiment.) At times this sequel feels more like Indiana Jones at Eton than an excursion into the realms of witchcraft and wand-waving - indeed the whole long trip into the titular tomb with its murky serpent-infested caves is as generic as The Mummy movies or a Lara Croft videogame.There are also wasted opportunities with John Cleese and Shirley Henderson - two wonderfully distinctive actors who here play phantoms (quite literally) of their former selves. They are rendered as see-through ghosts the special effects of which are anything but special.But Chamber of Secrets does have its plusses and its pleasures Breakfast at the Weasleys is a cozy comic affair; the creepy mandrake plants in the Hogwarts greenhouse have a life of their own; Dobby the elf is a whole lot better a synthespian than George Lucas Jar Jar Binks; Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) is emerging as the most interesting of Potters Gryffindor chums and Alan Rickman (as the nasty and no-good Professor Snape) gets to snicker and sneer with relish.And it is with mixed emotions that one watches the final film performance from Richard Harris - as the Merlinesque Professor Dumbledore his voice raspy his ruddy mug hidden behind a big white beard. Harris died three weeks ago and his disappearance presents a casting challenge for the team (including a new director The Little Princess Alfonso CuarAn) busy working on 2004s Potter installment The Prisoner of Azkaban. Still its great to see Harris one last time - he brought a genial gravitas to the halls of Hogwarts.Contact Steven Rea at sreaphillynews.com or 215-854-5629.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  (Out of four stars)Produced by David Heyman directed by Chris Columbus written by Steve Kloves photography by Roger Pratt music by John Williams distributed by Warner Bros.

Rowling  Story Do Potter films spoil imagination?  Story Magic at premiere of Chamber of Secrets  Story Pirated Potter turns up online VIDEO Ready for Chamber of Secrets? CNNs Jodi Ross gives a crash course in must-know HP information. (November 13) PLAY VIDEO Everyones favorite boy wizard returns to the screen. CNNs Jodi Ross reports. (November 11) PLAY VIDEO (CNN) -- Snakes? Check. Spiders? Check. A breathtaking game of Quidditch? Check. And its even better this time around. The film adaptation of ""Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets"" once again sticks fairly closely to the source material -- the second book in the phenomenally successful series by J.K. Rowling. This time the story is darker funnier and contains much more action and adventure. In the first movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" Harry was much more passive and a lot of basic information had to be conveyed to the audience about witchcraft and Harrys background. ""Chamber"" however hits the ground running. We find Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) at home for summer vacation after his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His muggle (non-magical) relatives Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) have Harry locked away in his room where he is forbidden from performing any magic. Not only is he locked away hes despondent over not hearing from his closest friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Herminone Granger (Emma Watson). Then suddenly at one of his darkest moments a strange house-elf named Dobby appears in Harrys bedroom warning him that his life is in danger and he must not to return to Hogwarts for his second year. Dobby has even gone as far as blocking all correspondence from Harrys friends in his desperate efforts to prevent Harry from going back to school. Of course Dobbys actions make Harry even more determined to return. At this point Ron and two of his older brothers -- troublemaking twins George and Fred -- show up in a magical flying car and rescue the young wizard. Once hes back in the warmth of the Weasley household he begins plans to enter his second year at Hogwarts. The usual suspects After a few mishaps Harry and his friends arrive back in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts but things are not well. A mysterious chamber has been opened someone is paralyzing students and the future of the school is in jeopardy. Harry and company must find the culprit or face a life without magic. All the usual suspects have returned. Robbie Coltrane is once again Rubeus Hagrid the faithful groundskeeper at Hogwarts and Harrys loyal friend. The late Richard Harris who died after filming was completed is the Headmaster of Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman is the enigmatic potions professor and the head of Slytherin House Professor Severus Snape. The incomparable Maggie Smith is once again Professor Minerva McGonagall the deputy headmistress of Hogwarts. In addition Tom Felton is back as Harrys archenemy Slytherin leader Draco Malfoy. A few new characters are also introduced including Jason Isaacs (2000s ""The Patriot"") as Lucius Malfoy Dracos Machiavellian father and Kenneth Branagh as the self-centered professor of the Dark Arts Gilderoy Lockhart. People who criticized director Chris Columbus for being too faithful to the book in the first ""Harry Potter"" movie will probably have the same complaint here. I on the other hand liked the fact that Columbus has such a loyalty to Rowlings written word. With a fan base like Harrys I believe its wise to stick with what has already worked so well. New developments Kenneth Branaghs character the egotistical Lockhart is the best developed in ""Chamber."" Branaghs character is the best developed of all the new players. He looks like hes having a delightful time playing the egotistical Lockhart. Rickman on the other hand is under-utilized in his role of Snape. And its rather sad to see Harris last performance be such a journeymans role -- third banana in a kids flick -- but at least its a GREAT BIG kids flick. Radcliffe and Grint have both grown a bit and their voices are beginning to deepen but none of the kids (including Watson) have changed too drastically over the last year. It has just been one year however; the next film is not due out until 2004 and there will be two years of growth involved. That may be more problematic. The best new character hands down is Dobby the house-elf voiced by Toby Jones and created from scratch by Industrial Light and Magic. He interacts wonderfully with Harry and rivals the cinematic perfection of the sword-wielding Yoda in the last ""Star Wars"" installment. Once again the production values -- the sets costumes and props -- are pure perfection. Stuart Craig who was nominated for an Oscar for ""Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone"" returns as production designer; Lindy Hemming (who won an Academy Award for ""Topsy-Turvy"") created the costumes; and the special effects were stunningly designed by Jim Mitchell Nick Davis and John Richardson. Hollywood sequels rarely match the originals with ""The Godfather II"" and the second ""Star Trek"" notable exceptions. Now joining those ranks is ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."" The people at Warner Bros. (like CNN a division of AOL Time Warner) can relax they have another hit on their hands. A good thing too as with seven ""Harry Potter"" books expected ""Potter"" is more than a sequel -- its a franchise. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" opens nationwide on Friday. Its rated PG.

Posted August 1 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT Familiarity - the very opposite of surprise - works unexpected wonders in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets the second installment in the movie adaptations of J.K. Rowlings kid-cosmos-changing books. The busy opulence of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry now feels homey. The contrasting personalities and acting styles of young Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry and his wizard-in-training schoolmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger blend into a complementary group pluckiness. The fairy-dust music-by-the-handful of John Williams sounds like its been in our ears forever. This is a most Muggle-ish kind of alchemy but everyday magic all the same In just a year (of product saturation and more earthbound audience expectations) the ""Harry Potter"" movie factory has established itself as a blue-chip enterprise that knows how to manage talent and resources admirably in the service of Rowling and Hollywood both. True the ""HP"" corporation doesnt achieve the gravity-defying loft of say Peter Jacksons first installment of ""The Lord of the Rings."" Director Chris Columbus Mall-of-America-built ""Home Alone"" style isnt engineered for leaps; its made for marathons sequels ""Home Alone 2""s. Still this time around Im more comfortable with the limitations of Columbus own powers - and maybe Columbus is too ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is an improvement on ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" not only because the director and his team are more confident about what they can do but also because theyre less uptight and defensive about what they cant. And among the things this ""HP"" does very well indeed is deepen the darker more frightening atmosphere for audiences of all ages already familiar with the intricacies of the ""Potter"" landscape. (This is as it should be Harrys story is supposed to get darker.) Besides the gathering darkness is funny as often as its scary the returning actors now fully filling out their flowing robes and pointed hats. As the second year at Hogwarts begins Harry and his friends get off to a nerve-racking start. A noodgey house-elf called Dobby warns our young hero that disaster will follow if he comes back to school. Ron and Harry who miss the Hogwarts Express must hightail it to campus in a flying car enduring a perilous thwacking when they crash-land into the Whomping Willow tree. Indeed particularly bad juju does seem to haunt the school halls. And by the end of two hours and 41 minutes the juju has been dramatized to within an inch of overload. (Reader patience isnt the same as viewer patience and there are still too many adventures crammed however efficiently into Steve Kloves script.) But many of the intricate new difficulties bring with them new characters marvelously played by fresh king-and-queen hams who conjure the old-fashioned art of well-placed acting. ""It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasnt talking"" Rowling writes of the flamboyantly vain phony Gilderoy Lockhart the schools new Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts and no one plays brilliant hilarious narcissism better than Kenneth Branagh in a role for which the preternaturally seasoned fellow has apparently waited all his life. Then again in a sneer-and-smarm showdown Branagh has a worthy adversary in Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy toxic father of Harrys chief bully and Slytherin nemesis Draco (Tom Felton). Any time these two Master Thespians appear working their facial muscles for fun and profit - and for that matter with every juicy scene involving Alan Rickman as Professor Snape Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall or the late lamented Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore - ""The Chamber of Secrets"" reaches its full power. Shirley Henderson squeaks eloquently as Moaning Myrtle who haunts one of the toilets in the girls bathroom. And Radcliffe too is blossoming into his own supple adolescent powers as a charming and handsome young man who does Harry and his fans great justice. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" still doesnt quite trust itself as a freestanding cinematic creation. But maybe its not meant to at least not on Columbus watch. And maybe what comes across this time is the directors peace with his own limitations. Okay so the production team is still overinvested in fancy special effects (Dobby the elf looks like hes a mudblood himself with a lot of Yoda in his lineage). And hes still partial to convoluted action sequences the most tricky of which include a visit to the Forbidden Forest where Harry and Ron meet the giant spider Aragog and a Lord Voldemort-haunted climax of good and evil involving Harry the mysterious Tom Riddle (Christian Coulson) and a slithery basilisk. But if it doesnt fly this ""Chamber"" at least hovers nicely a few feet off the ground for good stretches of time. Which still leaves a lot of airspace available for when ""A Little Princess"" director Alfonso Cuaron - a real master of jewel-like enchantment - takes over the magic in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.""

(c)Warner Brotherd Pictures By David Germain AP Movie Writer Year two at Hogwarts certainly makes for better viewing than freshman year. Yet like any school calendar overstuffed with well school stuff ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets starts dragging its tail around midterms. After an hour and a half of generally brisk action greatly improved special effects and a decent dose of dry British humor it feels like time for director Chris Columbus to kick it into the homestretch with a taut finale. Instead youre barely halfway through and the next hour-plus of magic and mayhem might wear down all but the most indomitable ""Harry Potter"" fans. What happens in these stories just is not interesting enough to merit running times edging toward three hours. (That said stick around through the closing credits; if youve hung in this long its worth lingering to catch an amusing gag involving new cast member Kenneth Branagh). The keepers of the boy-wizard franchise decided long ago to be as inclusive as possible in the movies seemingly a reasonable move to satisfy legions of young readers who want as verbatim a translation as possible from page to screen. But a year ago those kids groused anyway about omissions in ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. Theyll grouse the same about ``Chamber of Secrets though it runs 2 hours 41 minutes _ nine minutes longer than the first film. So why not cut the cute but nonessential filler and bring ``Chamber of Secrets in at a brisk breathless two hours? Still ``Chamber of Secrets is fairly fun despite its length. The movie nicely blends livelier humor and a darker tinge than ``Sorcerers Stone and the performances of Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and pals Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger (Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) are much more self-assured and authentic. While Columbus ``Sorcerers Stone essentially was a cinematic transcription of the book he manages a bit more idiosyncrasy with ``Chamber of Secrets while sticking to the letter of J.K. Rowlings narrative. Good casting for new characters expanded roles for some returning ones dazzling sets and effects creepy creatures and amusing dialogue and sight gags all help light a spark lacking in the first film for all its box-office success. Harrys second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a slow buildup to his rematch with the evil conjurer Voldemort the bad guy who killed his parents and left that zigzag scar on his forehead and whose butt Harry kicked in the first film. The movie touches on knotty themes of racism in the wizard world as conservative elements spout desires to carry out a sort of sorcerers ethnic cleansing and rid their realm of ``mudbloods _ those born of nonmagical Muggle parents. All key happenings have been incorporated from the book Appearances by house elf Dobby (a cuddly addition for young children); the ride to school in a flying car thats all but demolished by a Whomping Willow; the targeting of Harry by an enchanted game ball during the Quidditch match on flying broomsticks an event vastly enhanced over last years game thanks to George Lucas ILM effects house; the ``petrification of students and messages of doom written in blood on the walls; the time-traveling diary that falls into Harrys hands; the nest of giant spiders and Harrys battle with a massive serpent. Richard Harris recent death makes his stately performance as Hogwarts master Dumbledore all the more poignant. Maggie Smith as crisp but kindly Professor McGonagall Robbie Coltrane as noble behemoth Hagrid and Alan Rickman as sullen Professor Snape remain standouts among the adult cast. Branagh provides great comic highlights as the preening dandy Gilderoy Lockhart Hogwarts new defense-against-the-dark-arts teacher. Limited to a few seconds on screen in the first film Julie Walters is delightfully shrill this time as Mrs. Weasley (though John Cleese as the ghost Nearly Headless Nick remains a nonentity). Jason Isaacs the loathsome British butcher of ``The Patriot menacingly adds to his resume of villains as Lucius Malfoy a bigoted wizard and father of Harrys school rival Draco (played with increasing odiousness by Tom Felton). Shirley Henderson makes a quirky addition as Moaning Myrtle the ghost who offers to share the toilet she haunts with Harry in case he gets killed. Columbus plans to remain on as a producer for the franchises third flick ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban due out in summer 2004. New director Alfonso Cuaron who made 1995s ``A Little Princess and this years racy Spanish-language hit ``Y Tu Mama Tambien will be kept on a short leash in terms of closely mirroring the novel but he brings a fresh eye and playful style that bode well for Chapter 3. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" runs 161 minutes and is rated PG for scary moments some creature violence and mild language.

While ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" may slavishly adhere to its source novel nearly as much as its predecessor did it is on every count a better movie than last years first film installment in the telling of the story of a young wizards startling education. Darker and more dramatic this account of Harrys troubled second year at Hogwarts may be a bit overlong and unmodulated in pacing but it possesses a confidence and intermittent flair that begin to give it a life of its own apart of the literary franchise something the initial picture never achieved. With Pottermania perhaps having cooled over the course of a year from the heat level of a burning furnace to that of a happily bubbling cauldron it cant be expected that ""Chamber of Secrets"" will hit the dizzying commercial heights of ""Sorcerers Stone"" which at 967 million total gross (317.6 million from the U.S.) stands as the No. 2 worldwide B.O. hit of all time. But its mammoth success remains a foregone conclusion. Just as author J.K. Rowling assumed a certain reader knowledge in her second book (published in 1999) so do returning director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves rightly presume to pare exposition down to the minimum this time out (its hard to imagine anyone seeing this who hasnt caught the original). So its only a matter of about 20 minutes until Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) who has endured a dispiriting summer as a virtual prisoner at the suburban home of his dreadfully conventional uncle and aunt is off again to Hogwarts to resume his study of witchcraft and wizardry. Happily a good part of the buildup is spent back at Diagon Alley where Harry first encounters Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh so ideally cast youd think Rowling wrote the character with him in mind). The preening author of the autobiography ""Magical Me"" Lockhart is joining the Hogwarts faculty as teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Also entering the stage for the first time is Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) the blond-tressed evil-oozing father of Harrys school archrival Draco. Mysteriously prevented from passing through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters at Kings Cross station Harry and his best friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) are forced to travel by car -- Rons dads flying Ford Anglia to be specific -- which lands the boys safely on the school grounds but none too smoothly in the mighty branches of an ancient tree that takes great offense at the intrusion. Although Harrys voice has dropped an octave or so since the first year hes not really a teenager yet; all the same there is a new ardor in his excitement over reuniting with Hermione (Emma Watson) the top student in their class. Aptly Harry Ron and Hermione seem more truly and enthusiastically like best friends and co-conspirators this time around; a little self-consciousness is evident and the young leading thesps indulge in moments of spontaneity that reassuringly suggest they now feel more at home in their roles. Although Hogwarts is still dominated by the same figures -headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and Hagrid the Giant (Robbie Coltrane) -- and classes begin promisingly with Lockhart and the new professor of Herbology Sprout (Miriam Margolyes) who performs a particularly amusing demonstration of the proper method of topping mandrakes all is not well. Harry starts hearing a malevolent voice of unknown origin urging him to kill and a pet cat is found hanging in a hallway. These and subsequent events in which students are found ""petrified"" lead to speculation about Hogwarts legendary Chamber of Secrets which is thought to have been reopened. Professor McGonagall tells her charges such a chamber the alleged home of a terrifying monster has never been found which only encourages Harry Ron and Hermione to dig into its mysteries. Conflict hinges on the supposition that whoever opened the chamber must be the descendent of Salazar Slytherin the renegade co-founder of Hogwarts who insisted only pure-blooded wizards and witches should be permitted at the school. Suspicion naturally falls upon Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) whose father is ardently committed to ridding the institution of ""Muggles"" or the children of normal human beings; to this end Hermione begins preparing an exotic potion to enable her and her two friends to interrogate Draco on the subject. But the possibility cannot be ignored that in the manner of ""Star Wars"" Luke Skywalker Harry Potter himself is the unknowing descendent of the most accomplished and evil wizard on the books. Certainly others think so; Harry conveniently turns up wherever an unseemly incident occurs and he surprises even himself by being a Parselmouth someone able to converse with a snake. In a nicely rendered sepia sequence Harry learns a good deal from the ""interactive"" diary of a long-ago student named Tom Riddle whose exploits in the chamber reveal the involvement of Hagrid and Dumbledore and the portentous escape of a spider. When Hermione becomes petrified and is removed to hospital and the schools very existence becomes threatened by all the disturbances Harry and Ron undertake a visit to Hagrids then to a spider-infested forest to crack the puzzle. Ultimately however Harry must enter the chamber himself and sword in hand Siegfried-style confront the beast. The nocturnal spider sequence will spawn many a childhood nightmare to be sure but the climactic serpent battle packs genuine tension; differentiating between this PG-rated action and that in ""The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring"" which earned a PG-13 is an exercise in hair-splitting. In any event parents might want to think twice about taking genuine small fry along to ""Chamber of Secrets."" With the newfound confidence shown by Columbus and the continued shrewd stewardship of producer David Heyman improvements over the first film are to be found in all departments. Cinematographer Roger Pratt (""Batman"" ""The End of the Affair"") taking over from John Seale whose strength always has been location lensing rather than studio lighting has Columbus moving the camera much more than before which gives the film increased momentum and visual energy; greater contrasts between light and shadow add a darker tone. Production designer Stuart Craig whose splendid work was perhaps the felicitous highlight of ""Sorcerers Stone"" adds to his accomplishment here with superb creations for Dumbledores office the spiders lair and the massive chamber itself. New costume designer Lindy Hemming (""Topsy Turvy"") has added to the imaginative costumes established by Judianna Makovsky with witty creations for the showy Lockhart and the sinister Lucius among others. Even the new Quidditch match is better achieved than the blandly computerized-looking counterpart the first time out. The greatest relief of all The volume and aggressiveness of John Williams calamitous score for the original has been reduced several times over to the point where the musical accompaniment which still remains more ever-present than absolutely necessary nonetheless functions in a properly supportive and helpful manner. Near-epic running time which filmmakers might rationalize as necessary to accommodate all the essential incidents of the novel might prove wearying to some but wont be a barrier; at 161 minutes pic is nine minutes longer than ""Sorcerers Stone"" although final credits run a full 10 minutes. At the end of them is a very short filmed coda revealing the humorous fate of one of the principals. A more muscular filmmaker might have made the film seem to pass more quickly via imaginative pacing -- Columbus gives every scene equal weight and never varies the tempo -- but pic is not likely to induce active squirming despite the length. However if Kloves scripts are to remain as all-inclusively faithful to the novels as the first two have been one has to begin worrying about the running times of the forthcoming productions given the massively expanding length of the books. In addition to the welcome contributions of series newcomers Branagh Margolyes and Isaacs film features a commanding turn by Christian Coulson as the mysterious Tom Riddle. Rather less enchanting is a CGI creature named Dobby the elfin servant of Lucius who at intervals imparts crucial information to Harry but in the way he annoyingly prattles on and on threatens to become the Jar Jar Binks of the Potter series. By contrast some of the other creatures notably the mandrakes and the serpentine Basilisk are splendidly realized. While the late Richard Harris plays a much more significant role than he did in the first entry and seizes opportunities to inject whimsy when possible it must be said that he looks none too well here The voice is weak the skin noticeably pale even with all the makeup. For the next series entry ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" which begins production next spring and therefore wont be ready for holiday release a year hence Alfonso Cuaron will assume the directorial reins from Columbus who will remain as exec producer. Its a prospect that has fans curious already as to the different inflections the talented Mexican helmer might bring to this very British franchise. In the meantime the series has already taken a step in the right direction. Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsProductionA Warner Bros. release of a Heyday Films/1492 Pictures production.
