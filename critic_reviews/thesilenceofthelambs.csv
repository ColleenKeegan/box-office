The American Film Institutes list of 100 most heart-pounding U.S. movies names the film at number six. (AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday February 17 2015 316 PM (Originally published by the Daily News on Feb. 14 1991. This story was written by Kathleen Carroll) Do not be deceived by the fact that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is opening on Valentines Day. It is definitely not a romantic comedy. Still director Jonathan Demmes brilliantly executed adaptation of Thomas Harris gristly novel is a kind of love story - or at least that is how Demme sees it. For at the heart of this unnerving suspense movie is a terrifyingly intimate relationship between a sociopathic genius (who makes the most notorious Nazi butchers seem like saints) and a dedicated career woman (who for all her drive and ambition is as pure as a nun). They meet under unusual circumstances. Clarice Starling played by Jodie Foster is first glimpsed sweating her way through an obstacle course as part of her FBI training. Shes clearly a woman on the run someone who by sheer force of will has nearly succeeded in erasing a painful family history and backwater Southern roots. She is pleased when her superior Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) asks her to question the notorious Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) whos being kept under glass in the medieval-like dungeon of a prison for the criminally insane. Lecter is a psychiatrist who gained fame or taking a devouring interest in his patients. He actually ate several of them earning the tabloid nickname ""Hannibal the Cannibal."" The FBI is currently investigating a rash of unsavory murders in which the killer skins his female victims. On the the theory that it takes one psychopath to know another FBI officials are hoping for some tips from Lecter. The fateful meeting turns out to be an exercise in humiliation of Clarice a truly harrowing scene. Clarice summons all her courage to face the sadistic shrink but Lecter has a commanding presence. Relishing the superiority of his intellect he instantly recognizes her true vulnerability watching with a self-satisfied smirk as Clarice struggles to maintain her professional composure. Still theres a glimmer of admiration as Lecter examines Clarice with his penetrating eyes. She leaves the prison in a state of shock her mind flooded with memories of her father a deputy sheriff killed in the line of duty. For Clarice is in effect torn between two substitute father figures - her devious mentor Lecter and the brusque Crawford - as she stalks a killer before he mutilates another victim. New York Daily News Review of Silence Of The Lambs from February 1991. (New York Daily News) Demme has remained remarkably true to Harris novel although the ending has been altered to extent that it suggests the possibility of a sequel. The movie scary and graphic to cause timid souls (such as this writer) to close their eyes at certain points has a vise-like grip on the audience. From the first one is propelled along the emotional force of tautly directed high-tension scenes. The tension falls off a bit on the confrontation with the creepy killer whos a dime-store criminal compared with Lecter. There are holes in the plot but the two unlikely partners in crime-solving - the flesh-eating Sherlock Holmes and his female Dr. Watson - remain wonderfully complex characters their psychotherapy sessions turning into an exorcism of her personal demons. Photographed in intense closeups Foster is riveting her clear blue eyes and tight smile indicating both the aspiring FBI agents keen intelligence and her innermost fears. Delivering verbal assaults on Clarices psyche in a wickedly sarcastic tone Hopkins transforms Lecter into one of the most memorable villains in movie history. His hand brushed Clarices in a gesture of such palpable intimacy that the audience feels as naked and exposed as his young protegee. Even the touches of comic relief cannot shatter the spell cast by this magnetic monster who wants to know Clarice to the very depths of her soul.

Directed by Jonathan Demme from a script by Ted Tally. Crossroads Factoria Gateway Grand Cinemas Alderwood Kent Metro Southcenter United Artists Cinema 150. ``R - Restricted due to language extreme violence. Deliberately opening ``The Silence of the Lambs on Valentines Day must be some studio executives idea of a sick joke. Yet this serial-killer thriller is anything but. Jonathan Demmes hypnotic adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel has a seriousness and intensity thats been entirely lacking in horror movies lately. Coming after a run of generic high-concept no-brain thrillers (``Pacific Heights ``Run ``Sleeping With the Enemy) its especially welcome. Demmes film is frightening on both visceral and intellectual levels inviting favorable comparison with such unnerving classics of the genre as Hitchcocks ``Psycho and John McNaughtons ``Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer as well as such literary forerunners as Dostoyevksys ``Crime and Punishment. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are first rate as respectively a smart young FBI trainee and the imprisoned serial killer who ingeniously manipulates her. Scott Glenn plays her new boss who tells her to interview Hopkins find out how he thinks but ``never forget what he is. With the best of intentions (she wants Hopkins to help her understand and track down another killer) she does forget playing into his hands by giving him personal details that he uses to play on her fears. His mental abilities verge on the telepathic but he has nothing but contempt for humanity. He remains an unrepentant killer almost as dangerous in his cell as he is on the loose. Hes physically as difficult to defeat as the monster in any traditional horror film and he has a brain that makes him seem more than human. He mocks conventional morality and finds ultimate satisfaction in violence much like the heart-of-darkness militarist Marlon Brando played in ``Apocalypse Now. Hes the monster as genius and Hopkins plays him with disturbing authority. By comparison the killer Foster and Glenn are trailing is an amateur. He has his weaknesses and he can be caught although ``The Silence of the Lambs suggests that only someone who has begun to think like him can defeat him. The mood of the film becomes increasingly black and desperate as Foster finds herself being dragged down to this level. The open-ended finale which invites us to applaud the demise of the movies most loathsome non-killer is especially insidious. As with Hitchcock at his most troubling Demme implicates the audience dragging us into a vicarious conspiracy with a murderer. On a technical level ``The Silence of the Lambs is as fine as anything Demme has done. Howard Shores mood-darkening score is invaluable. Tak Fujimotos crisp cinematography always intensifies the subjective feeling of the piece. The sharpness of Craig McKays editing is especially noticeable during a tricky tour-de-force episode in which Glenn and his men surround their quarrys home. Although Demme is most strongly identified with Americana (``Melvin and Howard) and zany farce (``Married to the Mob) this is not his first attempt to deal with material of this weight. He was surprisingly successful with the 1986 ``Something Wild which started out as a screwball comedy and gradually deftly darkened into a gripping story of homicidal jealousy. Working from a tight script by Ted Tally (``White Palace) Demme doesnt mix his moods this time although there are several character-defining touches of humor. Foster is first seen jogging and working out on a trail that carries the legend ``Hurt agony pain love it. Shes dwarfed by the male FBI agents she seems vulnerable yet shes slyly amusingly abrupt when it comes to intercepting passes most of which come from the men she works with. She may be scared she may feel out of her element but Foster demonstrates that shes supremely self-possessed. The intimidating intellect of the Hopkins character is also reflected in his abundant wit which he uses to provoke and torment his jailers. A prize-winning psychiatrist who became a killer and cannibal he cold-bloodedly assesses the murder of a former patient ``It was the best thing for him; his therapy was going nowhere.

Jonathan Demmes chilling and extremely accomplished The Silence of the Lambs offers the rare opportunity to savor what penthouse talent can do in a traditionally low-rent area.Predictably this gruesomely mesmerizing piece forces us to look at things we would rather not see. But the true strength of Demmes movie lies in its exploration of a place beyond physical revulsion - in the darkest corners of the souls of both the hunters and the hunted. With Jodie Foster as the resourceful but troubled young FBI agent Scott Glenn as her mentor and above all Anthony Hopkins as the brilliant murderer whose help she is forced to enlist there is an extensive psychological subtext that resonates through The Silence of the Lambs.In adapting Thomas Harris best-selling novel Demme has made the most of what set it apart - the idea of tracking one madman through the warped psyche of another. In doing so he has found a way around the central problem that confronts any director trying to bring new life to a movie about a serial killer.Just as The Silence of the Lambs is about several forms of degradation its genre has suffered the erosion that comes of numbing and often sickening repetition. Seeking to galvanize jaded audiences each film has been a cut below its predecessor and has shown ever grosser mutilations.Last years unforgettable Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer suggested that motive might be irrelevant or even nonexistent in a way that the sane portion of humanity can grasp. The Silence of the Lambs posits an ingenious and provocative variation - a mind so twisted that it cannot be approached by any normally trodden path of investigation.Fosters Clarice Starling is a finely etched addition to the gallery of fringe-dwellers she has given us since Taxi Driver. Starling is chosen to join the hunt for a serial killer who goes by the nickname Buffalo Bill and makes dresses from the skin he flays off his young victims. The search intensifies when he kidnaps the daughter of a U.S. senator.The movie intensifies measurably when Starling visits Hannibal Lector a psychologist incarcerated in maximum security for the rest of his life for serial murders. His trademark is posthumous cannibalism. The choice of Hopkins for this role is a masterstroke and not only because he is a superlative actor Hopkins cumulative screen image is one of civility and decency and the association adds to the withering macabre effect of his murderer. It is a remarkably lucid portrait of lunacy.Lector seeks more than less strict confinement in return for his help in tracking Buffalo Bill. He wants to take Starling to things in her past that she has long repressed. So to catch one killer she must make a Faustian pact with another and this intriguing parallel line of inquiry reveals as much about the hunter as the quarry.It is thus a very different form of police corruption that Foster Hopkins and Demme examine and it is the ingredient that elevates The Silence of the Lambs from the basement where the finale inevitably takes place. Demme himself started off in that basement when he debuted in 1974 with the Roger Corman prison movie Caged Heat. He acknowledges his roots by giving Corman a cameo as an FBI boss. In The Silence of the Lambs he has fashioned a memorable film that says you can indeed return to the basement without lowering your standards.THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS    1/2Produced by Edward Saxon Kenneth Utt and Ron Bozman; directed by Jonathan Demme; written by Ted Tally; photography by Tak Fujimoto; music by Howard Shore; distributed by Orion Pictures.Running time 1 hour 58 mins.Clarice Starling - Jodie FosterHannibal Lector - Anthony HopkinsJack Crawford - Scott GlennBuffalo Bill - Ted LevineDr. Frederick Chilton - Anthony HealdParents guide R (extreme violence and gore profanity)Showing at area theaters Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementCruz pledges to unify GOP AmericansMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

And now the mischievous Orion execs are giving us The Silence of the Lambs a serial-killer thriller as a valentine. Whats next? A remake of Rosemarys Baby for Mothers Day?Talk about your sick jokes.But seriously folks The Silence of the Lambs will indeed debut today and despite the questionable timing I can recommend the film to those with strong stomachs. Its grisliness is more psychological than visual but theres enough of both varieties to shake up almost anyone.The movie tells the tale of a psychopath known as Buffalo Bill who not only kills young women but also skins them. Hot on the trail of this madman is Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) an FBI trainee whose mentor agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) sends her to visit another serial killer.This second killer is an inmate in a high-security mental hospital. In addition to being a vicious murderer known for eating the internal organs of his victims Hannibal the Cannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) also happens to be a brilliant psychiatrist who may offer Starling some insight into the mind of Buffalo Bill.Then again he may not.The Silence of the Lambs is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. That novel is clever and compelling in a pulp-fiction sort of way and some sections of the book that have been cut from the film (such as those that show how tough it is for Starling to steal time from her FBI classes to pursue the case) are missed.But theres a maniacally mean streak in Harris writing that fundamentally limits it. He appears for example to take a misogynous delight in the way he details the various affronts to Starlings safety and dignity - a delight that is only thinly disguised by the books occasional nods to feminism.In the screen version Harris mean streak and misogyny have been eliminated. Director Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob Something Wild) working from a screenplay by Ted Tally (the former playwright who co-wrote the film White Palace) retains Harris basic plot with its disturbing violence and creepy tone. But Demme emphasizes Starlings steely determination and generally keeps a respectful distance from her private thoughts.When youve finished reading the book you feel as if youve conducted an obscene investigation of every corner of Starlings psyche. When youve finished watching the movie the character seems more interesting because there are aspects of her personality - including her sexual orientation if any - that remain mysterious.Clarice Starling is the first movie role that Jodie Foster has tackled since winning the best-actress Oscar for The Accused (1988). I prefer her in the new film because Starlings courage and perseverance as well as her sense of privacy seem to tap into something genuine in Fosters personality.The best scenes in the movie (except for the brilliantly edited climactic confrontation between Starling and Buffalo Bill) are the meetings between Starling and Lector. In these psychological duels the FBI trainee attempts to elicit information from the mad doctor about Buffalo Bill and the doctor tries to squeeze from the trainee details of her private life.Foster plays these scenes like a master gamesman showing us how Starling sizes up each bounce of the conversational ball and then reveals just barely enough about herself to keep the doctor talking. (The actresss features look sharper than ever - especially her aggressive nose.) And as Lector Anthony Hopkins (The Bounty The Elephant Man) is riveting in these scenes With his piercing gaze he practically convinces you that the doctor can read minds.These verbal ping-pong matches are staged by director Demme with uncommon skill. He wasnt nearly this accomplished a filmmaker when he directed the 1979 thriller Last Embrace (in which incidentally the government agent was male and the serial killer was female.)Demme has always been a film artist capable of miracles when working on a personal project like Melvin and Howard (1980). But over the years he has also become a brilliant craftsman. Theres a solid professionalism in the way the director has put together The Silence of the Lambs - a skill that shows in the crispness of its pacing the imaginative compositions of its images and the plush textures of its cinematography (by Demmes usual photographer Tak Fujimoto).A certain reserve in tone may suggest that this material isnt particularly close to the directors heart. But no matter how explicit the movies violence and gore become Demme never takes the easy path of exploitation Even the shocking scene in which a mans corpse is suddenly shown suspended in midair is hauntingly poetic rather than merely brutal.Although The Silence of the Lambs is by no means a sequel to anything it does have a precursor of sorts. Manhunter the 1986 screen thriller based on Thomas Harris Red Dragon novel featured some of the same characters that The Silence of the Lambs does.Directed by Michael Mann of Miami Vice fame Manhunter was much closer in sensibility to Harris work than is Demmes film. Mann focused on Harris mean streak the way the author competes with the villains of his books by trying to convince his readers that hes almost as deranged as those bizarros.Demme comes at Harris material from another angle His movie may deal with madness but his perspective is mercifully sane.

Intimidating `Silence` - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Intimidating `Silence`Director Demme Subverts His Artistry In A Brutal ManipulationFebruary 14 1991|By Dave Kehr Movie critic.It`s always puzzling when a good director makes a bad movie but the case of Jonathan Demme`s ``The Silence of the Lambs`` seems downright baffling.More than a disappointment the film is an almost systematic denial of Demme`s credentials as an artist and filmmaker.Demme`s deserved reputation as one of America`s finest directors rests primarily on the series of warm eccentric comedies he began with ``Handle With Care`` in 1977 and developed through ``Melvin and Howard`` ``Something Wild`` and 1988`s ``Married to the Mob.``It`s easy to understand why he might want to shake off the cute and cuddly image that has settled on his work (though his films have always contained a beckoning dark side an edge of violence and despair).But ``The Silence of the Lambs`` does more than avoid sweetness and light. It`s a gnarled brutal highly manipulative film that at its center seems morally indefensible.Based on a novel by Thomas Harris whose ``Red Dragon`` was filmed by Michael Mann in 1986 as ``Manhunter`` the film continues the story of Dr. Hannibal Lector (now rakishly played by Anthony Hopkins) a once-brilliant psychiatrist who having been arrested and institutionalized for his habit of dining on human flesh is now the most prized serial killer in captivity.When Lector`s old nemesis FBI agent and serial-killer specialist Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) encounters a new killer he believes may be linked to Lector he sends a fresh young female trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview him knowing that Clarice`s innocence will draw out Lector`s sadistic show-off tendencies and with them a clue to the killer`s identity. The script by playwright Ted Tally (``Terra Nova``) develops parallels between Crawford`s exploitation of his female employee and the new killer`s use of his female victims. Nicknamed ``Buffalo Bill`` for his habit of skinning his prey the killer (Chicago actor Ted Levine) is apparently in the process of sewing himself a dress made of human skin.As images of institutional sexism go this one is (gulp) fairly extreme and ultimately the political point serves as no more than an alibi so thoroughly does Demme immerse himself in the details of the killer`s project. Long sequences shot from the killer`s point of view are set in his dungeon- like basement where he is keeping a young woman prisoner in a cistern in preparation for her ritual execution.Buffalo Bill who likes to tie ribbons in his hair and prance naked to acid rock is indeed a very bad man but that in itself does not excuse Demme`s growing characterization of Lector as a hero a droll witty man whose growing friendship with Clarice seems the one positive element in both of their lives.By the time Lector has exploited the situation sufficiently to put himself in a position to escape (which he does killing two guards with his teeth) the audience has been placed in the position of rooting him on. He may be a psycho killer but he`s our psycho killer smart resourceful and somehow on our side.Demme`s greatest talent is his ability to find exactly the right gestures and details of appearance to quickly and thoroughly characterize even the most minor players in his films giving his work a sense of human density and vitality possessed by no other filmmaker since the late Jean Renoir.It is particularly painful to see Demme betraying this talent in ``The Silence of the Lambs`` in the way he grants personalities to the victims we are supposed to care about (Brooke Smith as Bill`s prisoner gives a particularly wrenching performance) and withholds them from the victims who are somehow deserving or redundant (the two cops Lector kills). Most troubling is the way Demme caricatures the psychiatrist in charge of Lector`s hospital(Anthony Heald) as an officious boob and then serves him up almost literally as the film`s punchline.The movie`s moral compass spins wildly out of control but Demme never relinquishes his technical mastery.The film is composed of tiny needling details both in the nervous jittery editing by Craig McKay and the slimy textures captured by Tak Fujimoto`s cinematography.``The Silence of the Lambs`` is a film that exerts a vice-like grip on the viewer; it`s as closed and claustrophobic as Demme`s other films have been open and democratic.The intrusion of violence into ``Something Wild`` in the form of the gangster boyfriend played by Ray Liotta was an inevitable consequence of the dangerous freedom discovered by the characters When the rules break down all kinds of things can enter the system. In ``The Silence of the Lambs``however violence and cruelty are the system the way the killer holds his victim is the same way the director holds his audience through threats and intimidation.This isn`t the Jonathan Demme we know.``THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS``(STAR)Directed by Jonathan Demme; written by Ted Tally from the novel by Thomas Harris; photographed by Tak Fujimoto; edited by Craig McKay; production designed by Kristi Zea; music by Howard Shore; produced by Edward Saxon Kenneth Utt and Ron Bozman.

So much for pigeonholing. Demmes vision of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" Thomas Harris truly terrifying novel is stunning. It is also unusual--as the FBI races to save a kidnaped young woman from a serial killer Demme concentrates on the hypnotic duel between his two strong central characters an FBI trainee and a brilliant sociopath rather than on easy effects calculated to make an audience jump.They may jump anyway since ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (Thursday at selected theaters) is marked by the second appearance of Dr. Hannibal Lecter--Hannibal the Cannibal--and Anthony Hopkins insinuating performance puts him right up there with the screens great bogymen.We have seen Dr. Lecters pure evil before the imprisoned insane psychiatrist/murderer was played mesmerizingly by Brian Cox in ""Manhunter"" Michael Manns adaptation of Harris earlier novel ""Red Dragon."" Later perhaps realizing the pull of the monster he created Harris moved Lecter to the forefront of ""Lambs"" and here in Ted Tallys screenplay he very nearly owns the film. Only nearly--he would have to be superhuman to wrest this film away from Jodie Foster and Lecter is only super-deviant.Fosters Clarice Starling is a promising FBI trainee in her last year brought in by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) chief of the Bureaus Behavioral Science Section to do a psychological profile of Lecter. Although Starling isnt let in on the bureaus full agenda Crawfords hope is that Lecter can be lured into shedding light on one of his own kind a seemingly random serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill who flays the bodies of his women victims for his own unfathomable purposes.The build-up to Starlings first meeting with Lecter is as dramatic as the unmasking of the Phantom of the Opera. Warned not to tell him anything personal--""You dont want Lecter inside your head""--the list of things Starling may not do touch or say is capped by a photograph of Lecters last victim a nurse within the asylum whose grisly fate is graphically told and shown to Starling.Mercifully Demme doesnt share this sight with us although there will be a gruesomely clinical tour of one of Buffalo Bills victims in a later scene. The film is MPAA-rated R for explicit shots of the murder victims for terror for scenes of gore and violence and for language.The film swings between Starling and Lecter as though it were moving between sunlight and the chill of fluorescence. Even within the straitjacket of FBI-approved behavior Foster radiates intelligence sturdiness unspoken empathy with the poor dead victims and the most profound human concern.Hopkins sometimes literally straitjacketed exudes cunning a laser-keen intellect patent contempt for most of the world concentration that could seemingly bend spoons and terrifying physical power. Lecters persuasiveness becomes particularly threatening when he agrees to trade insights on Buffalo Bill for details of Starlings past and from these he forges an unsettling bond with her.Our fears about Lecter are heightened by Kristie Zeas production design for his isolation cell its bars are far apart separated by super-thick glass but the visual effect deliberately suggests that the glass isnt there at all that Lecter could simply reach through the bars to Starling . . . or to us. Demme punches up this immediacy as Hopkins and Foster work directly into cinematographer Tak Fujimotos camera in some of these early intense scenes a device that propels Lecters cajoling deprecating tirades directly at us.After Buffalo Bill kidnaps a U.S. senators feisty resourceful daughter (Brooke Smith) Crawford pulls Starling into the hunt as his assistant liking her insights and her deductions.Although Demmes touch with the interplay between Crawford and Starling is deft--Crawfords terseness belying his concern for her--when Starling takes off on her own to follow a Lecter clue to a long-abandoned storage garage Demme muffs one of the books prime scenes of terror. He seems unwilling to give this scene its full measure of anxiety letting it unroll without charge or crescendo. More to his liking are the films deadpan vignettes of a woman in a male-dominated world whether it is an FBI Academy elevator or a police examination room in the deep South.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJONATHAN DEMME  Family TiesAugust 22 1993Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-13/entertainment/ca-987_1_jonathan-demme,200,thesilenceofthelambs6,thesilenceofthelambs,latimes
Jodie Foster Appealing But Not `Silence Of The Lambs` - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Jodie Foster Appealing But Not `Silence Of The Lambs`February 15 1991|By Gene Siskel.OOur Flick of the Week is the highly touted horror film ``The Silence of the Lambs`` which has been billed as one of the most frightening depraved films ever made. Would that it were so.Instead this is a case of much ado about nothing. Jonathan Demme one of our most inventive directors has made a grab for the money in filming this story of the attempt by an FBI trainee (Jodie Foster) to catch a serial killer by subscribing to the theory that it takes one to know one.Foster smartly following her victim role in ``The Accused`` with a heroic role here interviews the terrible killer Dr. Hannibal ``The Cannibal`` Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in an effort to catch a freak nicknamed ``Buffalo Bill`` who likes to skin women.Dr. Lecter is no Boy Scout by comparison; he likes to eat the body parts of his victims. And right now you are probably thinking ``Maybe I`ll go see`Home Alone` again.`` Smart move.Or you could take a chance and screen on home video ``Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer`` which was a fascinating illuminating deadpan portrait of the same lethal subject. Instead director Demme superheats ``The Silence of the Lambs`` to the point of silliness in terms of both gross behavior and a pulsating soundtrack. The conclusion of the film is nothing more than a grisly version of every mad-slasher picture you`ve ever missed. Jodie`s in trouble. Shoot Jodie shoot.Fans of this film have weighed in with the comment that it illuminates the dark side of man. Not for me. ``The Silence of the Lambs`` romanticizes the dark side. Serial killers are hardly glamorous psychiatrists like Dr. Lecter who is to be feared Foster is told by her boss because he can devour your mind just by talking to you. Any 10-second video image of Charles Manson is more frightening than what goes on here as Lecter is interviewed behind a specially built glass prison wall-specially built for a movie that is.Foster`s character who is appealing is dwarfed by the monsters she is after. I`d rather see her work on another case.``The Silence of the Lambs`` is playing at the 900 N. Michigan Webster Place and outlying theaters. Rated R.

Skillful adaptation of Thomas Harris bestseller intelligently wallows in the fascination for aberrant psychology and pervese evil. Sharp script charts tenacious efforts of young FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to cope with the appalling challenges of her first case. Confounded by a series of grotesque murders committed by someone known only as Buffalo Bill bureau special agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) asks his female protege to seek the help of the American prison systems No. 1 resident monster in fashioning a psychological profile of the killer. Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) has been kept in a dungeon-like cell for eight years and while officious doctors and investigators can get nothing out of him he is willing to play ball with his attractive new inquisitor. Lecter gives Starling clues as to the killers identity in exchange for details about her past. Just as it seems the noose is tightening around the killer Lecter in a remarkably fine suspense sequence manages an unthinkable escape. Plot is as tight as a coiled rattler. Foster fully registers the inner strength her character must summon up. Scott Glenn is a very agreeable surprise as the FBI agent who takes a chance by putting his young charge on the case. Hopkins helped by some highly dramatic lighting makes the role the personification of brilliant hypnotic evil and the screen jolts with electricity whenever he is on. 1991 Best Picture Director Actor (Anthony Hopkins) Actress (Jodie Foster) Adapted Screenplay Nominations Best Editing Sound The Silence of the LambsProductionOrion/Strong Heart.

Comments (9) The Silence of the Lambs 118 minutes An accomplished effective grisly and exceptionally sick slasher film (1991) that I cant with any conscience recommend because the purposes to which it places its considerable ingenuity are ultimately rather foul. Like Thomas Harriss novel which screenwriter Ted Tally adapts here Jonathan Demmes film proposes that the psychotic serial killer is the essential religious figure of our time saint guru seer and soothsayer rolled into one. In fact this characterization applies literally to only one of the two serial killers here a psychiatrist (Anthony Hopkins) who cannibalizes his victims and is now held in maximum security. The heroine (Jodie Foster) an FBI trainee appeals to him for insight in tracking down another mad killer (Ted Levine) who flays his victims (and is a transvestite to boot allowing Demme to cash in on the homophobia market). In the course of parceling out his wisdom the psychiatrist also analyzes the trainee becoming an even more commanding father figure to her than the boss (Scott Glenn) who sends her on this mission. The radical premise that our society implicitly worships as well as fears serial killers underlies the queasy impact of this gory thriller without becoming its overriding thesis and while Demme has said that this story takes ""some really good pokes at patriarchy"" this is mainly wishful thinking. The film like its flesh-eating psycho is more bent on exploiting its insights than on teaching us anything. Like all other slasher movies from Psycho on this one ""works"" insofar as it plays on the desire to see victims preferably women get torn to pieces. Not even the best performances and direction--and this movie has talent to spare--can justify the putridity of the enterprise. For creepy sicko kicks Id rather watch the evening news.

Hannibal Lecter a serial killer nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal once liked to feast on his victims daintily in a meal designed to complement the particular nature of the main dish. He would for example choose a ""nice"" Chianti to accompany a savory liver. A fine Bordeaux would compete. Hannibal is a brilliant if bent psychiatrist now under lock and key in a maximum-security facility. Still at large though is a new serial killer known as Buffalo Bill for reasons that cant be reported here. Bills habit is to skin his victims. At the beginning of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) the F.B.I.s man in charge of Bills case seeks the assistance of a bright young agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster). Her assignment to interview Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) arouse his interest and secure his help in drawing a psychological profile of the new killer. The principal concern of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the entrapment of Buffalo Bill before he can kill again. Yet the heart of the movie is the eerie and complex relationship that develops between Clarice and Hannibal during a series of prison interviews conducted through inch-thick bulletproof glass. Hannibal as grandly played by Mr. Hopkins is a most seductive psychopath a fellow who listens to the ""Goldberg Variations"" and can sketch the Duomo from memory. Its not his elegant tastes that attract Clarice and certainly not his arrogant manner or his deaths-head good looks. His smile is frosty and his eyes never change expression. Its his mind that draws her to him. It pierces and surprises. Hannibal is one movie killer who is demonstrably as brilliant and wicked as he is reported to be. In their first interview Hannibal sizes up Clarice from her expensive bag and cheap shoes her West Virginia accent and her furrow-browed youthful determination not to appear intimidated. Hannibal isnt unkind to her. He is at first skeptical and then amused. Finally he is seduced by her at least to the extent that his egomania allows. She is flesh and blood and something more. As played by Miss Foster Clarice is as special in her way as Hannibal is in his. She is exceptionally pretty but her appeal has more to do with her character which is still in the process of being formed. Shes unsure of herself yet clear-headed enough to recognize her limitations. Clarice has the charm of absolute honesty something not often seen in movies or for that matter in life. Shes direct kind always a bit on edge and eager to make her way. When Hannibal finally agrees to help Clarice its with the understanding that for every bit of information he gives her she will tell him something about herself. Because Hannibal by nature and by profession is an expert in prying the questions he asks and the answers he receives both frighten and soothe the young woman. For Hannibal they are a turn-on. Through the bulletproof glass in dizzy succession Hannibal and Clarice become analyst and analysand teacher and pupil father and daughter lover and beloved while always remaining cat and mouse. Miss Foster in her first role since winning an Oscar for ""The Accused"" and Mr. Hopkins an actor of cool and eloquent precision give exciting substance to the roles written by Ted Tally who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Thomas Harris. An earlier Thomas novel ""Red Dragon"" in which the homicidal doctor also appears was the basis of the 1986 film ""Manhunter."" Miss Foster and Mr. Hopkins are so good in fact that Clarice and Hannibal sometimes seem more important than the mechanics of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" which is otherwise committed to meeting the obligations of a suspense melodrama. Mr. Demme meets most of these obligations with great style. The buildup to the dread Hannibals first scene is so effective that one almost flinches when he appears. Never after that for good reason does Hannibal become trusted though he is always entertaining to have around. Eventually though the demands of the plot begin to take precedence over people and plausibility. Hannibal not only can help with the Buffalo Bill case but he also knows who Buffalo Bill is. About halfway through so does the audience at which point the movie shifts to a lower more functional gear even as the pace increases. The screenplay which is very effective in detailing character is occasionally hard pressed to feed the audience enough information so that it can follow the increasingly breathless manhunt without a roadmap. Im told it helps if one has read the book but reading the book shouldnt be a requirement to enjoy the film. At a crucial point the audience must also accept as perfectly reasonable and likely some instant surgery that allows the story to continue moving forward. This may be hair-splitting. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not meant to be a handy home guide to do-it-yourself face liftings. Yet the movie is so persuasive most of the time that the wish is that it be perfect. Although the continuity is sometimes unclear the movie is clearly the work of adults. The dialogue is tough and sharp literate without being literary. Mr. Demme is a director of both humor and subtlety. The gruesome details are vivid without being exploited. He also handles the big set pieces with skill. The final confrontation between Clarice and the man she has been pursuing is a knockout -- a scene set in pitch dark with Clarice being stalked by a killer who wears night-vision glasses. Mr. Glenn is stalwart as Clarices F.B.I. mentor but the role is no match for those of his two co-stars. The good supporting cast includes Anthony Heald as another doctor who might be as nutty as Hannibal and Ted Levine as a fellow who spends more time making his own clothes than is entirely healthy. Roger Corman the self-styled king of B-pictures who gave Mr. Demme his start in film making appears briefly as the director of the F.B.I. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is pop film making of a high order. It could well be the first big hit of the year. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) includes some graphic still pictures of battered bodies.

Celebrities Who Have Left Scientology Inside Halseys Troubled Past Chaotic Present The Silence of the Lambs By Peter Travers February 14 1991 More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> The superbly crafted suspense thriller that director Jonathan Demme has made from Thomas Harriss taut best-selling novel The Silence of the Lambs slams you like a sudden blast of bone-chilling pulse-pounding terror. Clarice Starling played with heartfelt tenacity by Jodie Foster is an FBI trainee on the trail of a serial killer. Her search ends in the suburban home of dressmaker Jame Gumb (Ted Levine). It is Gumbs cellar workshop - the place where he shoots and skins his tall fleshy female victims - that Demme transforms into a harrowing vision of hell. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> Gumb jokingly dubbed Buffalo Bill by the cops in homicide because of his skill at flaying has just kidnapped his sixth victim Shes Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) the daughter of a U.S. senator (Diane Baker). But Gumb isnt interested in rape or political favors. He wants something else from Catherine whom he has trapped in a pit dug fifteen feet into his cellar floor. As Gumb lowers a basket on a thin string the camera picks up the bloody finger tracks of other women who have tried and failed to claw their way out. In the basket is a tube of skin lotion. Gumb keeps his captives alive for three days making sure that their skin stays supple for a hideous objective unfair to reveal (lets just say that the deaths-head moth - featured in ads for the film - is involved along with too much dime-store psychology). ""Rub the cream in or youll get the hose"" says Gumb tenderly holding a white poodle he calls Precious as he shouts his orders to Catherine. ""Yes it will Precious"" says Gumb referring to Catherine as an object not a person. ""It will get the hose."" That exchange is followed by the sound of Catherine screaming in fear again and again. Taken out of context these scenes could provoke protest from such forums as the National Organization for Women whose L.A. chapter recently threatened a boycott of the publisher of Bret Easton Elliss American Psycho because of the novels graphic depictions of women being tortured. Few could question the rise in crimes against women or the rise of misogyny in movies. In the Hollywood of the Nineties the next best thing to making a movie about Jack the Ripper is hiring someone like him to write or direct. But Silence of the Lambs does not merit censoring (free expression is still a constitutional right) or even censuring. Demme and Ted Tally the playwright (Terra Nova) turned screenwriter (White Palace) have set out to turn the exploitation genre on its empty head and fill it with ideas and purpose. Theres none of the all-in-fun disfigurement and dismemberment that you get in the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th gorefests. Theres none of the cheerleading for male sexual hostility that you get in The Rookie when Clint Eastwood blows away Sonia Braga and in Total Recall when Arnold Schwarzenegger does the same thing to Sharon Stone. The brutality in Silence leaves you shaken because its meant to seem painful instead of playful terrifying instead of titillating. Fosters Clarice Starling and Smiths Catherine Martin represent something unique in slasher movies women who wont play victim. Whenever possible Demme and ace cinematographer Tak Fujimoto take the point of view of Starling an FBI trainee whose ""Yes sir"" reserve around her superiors doesnt disguise her ambition. The camera sees what Starling sees a patriarchic society that deserves the acid ridicule it gets. Fittingly the movie begins with Starling running an obstacle course at the FBI academy in Quantico Virginia. She will confront many other obstacles as the story hurtles along the vast majority of them erected by men. Her cagey boss Special Agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) admires her grit. But hes not above using her as bait for a psycho. Crawford assigns Starling to do a behavioral profile on Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) a former psychiatrist imprisoned in a Baltimore asylum for carving up nine people and cooking his favorite bits. Dr. Lecter known as Hannibal the Cannibal prides himself on having once eaten the liver of a census taker with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. Crawford suspects Lecter may know the real identity of Buffalo Bill and thinks that a gander at the attractive Starling the first woman Lecter has seen in eight years may inspire him to talk. After rebuffing the sexual advances of the asylums chief administrator Dr. Frederick Chilton - played to smarmy perfection by Anthony Heald - Starling is allowed access to Lecters cell but only after being warned not to give him any personal details about her life. Chilton also advises Starling to use the sliding food carrier in the cell to pass files to Lecter. It seems a nurse leaned too close to Lecter nearly a decade before. ""His pulse never got over eighty-five"" says Chilton smiling ""not even when he ate her tongue."" Demme provides Lecter with the kind of lurid B-movie buildup the director cut his teeth on back in the Seventies with Caged Heat and Fighting Mad. And production designer Kristi Zea gives the snake pit of an asylum the medieval look of a Roger Corman horror show. But Demme isnt doing camp; hes aiming for a stylized hyperreality and most of the time he achieves it. As Starling walks past the barred cells toward Lecters glassed-in cubicle at the end of the corridor an inmate named Miggs hurls himself at the bars and says ""I can smell your cunt."" She barely flinches. Miggs pales before Starlings first sight of Lecter. Standing stone still his close-cropped head tilted ever so slightly and the beams from his cold eyes sharp enough to pierce glass he looms like a lion in his lair - glacial and lethal. Its the most frightening movie entrance in years and Hopkins doesnt move a muscle. A brilliant stage actor (Equus Antony and Cleopatra) Hopkins can sometimes be too much on film - check out his shameless hamboning in Audrey Rose. But this time he calibrates every nuance for maximum effect. Lecter figured in an earlier Thomas Harris novel Red Dragon filmed as Manhunter in 1986 with Brian Cox as the mad doctor. As chilling as Cox was his role was merely a cameo. Hopkins goes deeper. The polished elegant evil of his Lecter surpasses anything hes ever done on the screen. Hes a fiend for the ages. The confrontation scenes between Lecter and Starling are the heart of the picture and Hopkins and Foster - who is flawless in a performance on a par with her Oscar-winning work in The Accused - play off each other with enormous skill. Demme subjects them to long searching close-ups. With lesser actors such scrutiny could wreck the film by exposing theatricality and cant. But Foster and Hopkins dont make a false move. Starling knows Lecter is testing her trying to wear down her self-confidence. Based on her West Virginia accent and ""second-rate shoes"" he tags her as ""not more than one generation from poor white trash."" This fiercely intelligent and witty monster brings out her deepest fears. But when Starling manages to regain control after Miggs pitches a handful of his semen at her face Lecter is stirred. ""Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me"" says Lecter shaking with rage over Miggss action. He agrees to help Starling. But theres a condition. Lecter wants a transfer to another prison and for every clue Lecter gives about Buffalo Bill she must tell him something about herself. And so to save Catherine Martin Clarice Starling parcels out painful memories from her childhood. Lecter learns that Starling was orphaned at ten when her sheriff father was killed. She learns that Buffalo Bill like herself and Lecter suffered traumas in childhood. But before she can find out more Lecter discovers that Starling and Crawford have been lying about the deal to move him to another prison so he makes his own deal with Senator Martin. Later Starling talks herself into a tightly guarded room in Tennessee where Lecter is being held in an iron cage pending transfer. In exchange for crucial information Starling tells Lecter why she dreams about lambs screaming. The details arent important. But Starlings full exposure of the frightened child inside her is. As she reaches between the bars to take the file on Buffalo Bill from Lecters hand their fingers touch. The moment is brief but electric - a shuddering intimation of the consequences of misplaced trust. In the scenes that follow Lecter goes on a murderous rampage Starling tracks Buffalo Bill and Catherine Martin devises an ingenious plan to outwit her captor. Newcomer Brooke Smith invests Catherine with a vital and touching spirit; she can make a line like ""Come here Precious you little shit"" ring out like a call to arms. Its a sensational performance accurate right down to the full-out way she rocks along in her car to Tom Pettys ""American Girl"" just before meeting Buffalo Bill. Attention to this kind of detail is a Demme trademark. At his peak (Citizens Band Melvin and Howard Something Wild) Demme - a true maverick among the herd of Hollywood hacks - can intermingle comedy and drama because he builds on a solid foundation of character. Silence is a powerhouse that shows Demme at his best and boldest. Even the tacky flashbacks and a sequence lifted from Wait Until Dark cant blunt the films wallop. Demme celebrates his female warriors. You can feel his pride in Starling for rallying against her male demons. For all the unbridled savagery on display what is shrewd significant and finally hopeful about Silence of the Lambs is the way it proves that a movie can be mercilessly scary and mercifully humane at the same time.

"Silence of the Lambs The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; silence-of-the-lambs-the ) Silence of the Lambs The (United States 1991) A movie review by James Berardinelli When The Silence of the Lambs took the Academy Awards ceremony by storm in 1992 winning in five major categories (Best Picture Best Director - Jonathan Demme Best Actor - Anthony Hopkins Best Actress - Jodie Foster and Best Adapted Screenplay - Ted Tally) it beat the odds in more ways than one. Granted 1991 was a slow year for movies and many pundits have remarked that the Oscar field was among the weakest ever (the other contenders were Disneys Beauty and the Beast Bugsy JFK and the overrated The Prince of Tides) but the strong showing of The Silence of the Lambs was a surprise to almost everyone. In the first place it was released in February 1991 a date thought to be beyond the short memories of the Academy members. Secondly it is a dark psychological thriller - the kind of movie that occasionally receives a Best Picture nomination but almost never takes home the statuette. Although The Silence of the Lambs is brilliantly constructed and powerfully acted and became one of the most recognizable thrillers of the 90s it was neither the best movie of the year (a citation I would award to Beauty and the Beast) nor even the best thriller (overall Dead Again impressed me more). The Silence of the Lambs contains a number of inarguably great scenes but the screenplay adapted from Thomas Harris novel suffers from a split personality. The scenes featuring Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) are the stuff of legends. However the rest of the movie which concentrates on the pursuit of serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) has a familiar derivative feel. In truth the climax couldnt be more mundane. The Silence of the Lambs opens by introducing us to FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) a brilliant student who has been selected by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) the head of the FBIs Behavioral Science Unit to help in the pursuit of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill who skins his victims after murdering them. Crawford wants Clarice to approach the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter or ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" as he has become known and encourage Lecter to provide a profile of Buffalo Bill. Crawford claims that Lecter might be willing to open up to a woman - and hes right. The good doctor offers Clarice a quid pro quo deal. For every piece of information he shares about Buffalo Bill Clarice must reveal one detail about her past. So while Lecter is helping Clarice get closer to Buffalo Bill he is also worming his way into her psyche. Perhaps surprisingly however she is doing the same to him. There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox who was effective but not especially memorable as the good doctor in 1986s Manhunter Hopkins instantly makes the role his own capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day no matter how many roles he plays in the interim Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivorys The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives but none of them do justice to this chilling performance which I labeled as the best acting work of the 90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins Hannibal is both a suave cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"" which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.) Jodie Fosters interpretation of Clarice Starling is not as high-profile as Hopkins work but the film wouldnt have been the same without her. In a quiet non-flashy manner Foster takes ownership of Clarice transforming her into the movies human anchor; she is our point-of-entry into the contorted grotesque world of murder insanity and decadence. Clarice is developed into a multidimensional human being who is driven to succeed in a mans world haunted by memories of the loving father she lost at an early age and fascinated by the twisted brilliance of Lecter. There isnt a false note in the performance. Fosters best scenes are the ones in which she is paired with Hopkins such as the instance in which Clarices facial expression crumbles almost imperceptibly while Lecter coldly and cruelly dissects her life. Its arguable whether Foster deserved a Best Actress Oscar for her work in The Silence of the Lambs but theres no doubt that she is owed more recognition for the films success than she often receives. Its impossible to mention Clarice without noting that she is one of the rarest commodities in thrillers a female hero. In interviews Foster has indicated that of all the roles she has played in a career that began in childhood Clarice is her favorite (which makes it odd that she didnt try harder to re-arrange her schedule so she could reprise the part in The Silence of the Lambs sequel Hannibal). In addition to having to face Lecters mind-games and the dangers associated with Buffalo Bill she must deal with the sexual politics of being a woman in a mans world. The most telling scene occurs early in the movie when Crawford takes her on a ""field trip"" to view the latest victim. There in a hick town she finds herself stripped of authority as a result of a casual comment by Crawford and surrounded by a group of macho male cops. After momentarily escaping by taking flight into a memory of her fathers funeral she regroups and takes charge of the situation ordering the men to clear the room where the body is housed. Thus does Clarice become a woman championing victimized women - a real heroine not a woman imitating a testosterone-driven stereotype. In terms of psychological depth Lecter matches Clarice with ease. Hes far more intelligent and dangerous than any real-world serial killer; its a wonder that the FBI caught him at all (a story related as background material for Manhunter) and no surprise that they take extreme precautions when interacting with him. Lecter is part-man part-machine. Hopkins has invoked 2001s HAL when asked about his inspiration for crafting the character. Yet as cold as Lecter can be theres still a part of him that yearns to be recognized as a human being and this aspect draws him to Clarice. He respects her intelligence is intrigued by her ambition and femaleness and is moved by her sad and bitter reminiscences of her past life. He senses a kinship. Their relationship becomes twisted and complex with aspects of student and mentor father and daughter and husband and wife all rolled together. By the end of The Silence of the Lambs it is obvious that both characters have had a profound impact upon each other. Unfortunately as impossible as it is to look away from the screen when Lecter is on it the same compulsion does not exist for Buffalo Bill who is an ordinary demented personality drawn from Serial Killers 101. A combination of Ted Bundy Gary Heidnick and Ed Gein Buffalo Bill isnt much different from similar figures that populate less imposing motion pictures (such as the B-fare that never achieves a theatrical release). Ted Levine is adequate in the role but theres not much to grab on to a transvestite who is so fascinated with women that he is constructing an outfit out of their skin. Whats disappointing about The Silence of the Lambs presentation of Buffalo Bill (real name Jame Gumb) is that it doesnt offer the same detailed look into his pathology as it does that of Hannibal Lecter (or for that matter than Manhunter did of its antagonist played by Tom Noonan). In terms of villains Gumb almost looks like a clown next to Lecter and this dilutes the climaxs impact. Jonathan Demmes sure-handed direction is helped immeasurably by the work of his cinematographer (Tak Fujimoto) his production designer (Kristi Zea) and his editor (Craig McKay). The Silence of the Lambs consistently looks good builds suspense and does not outstay its welcome. Many two-hour thrillers have dead patches but thats one characteristic of the genre this movie avoids. Instead of using the common tactic of priming an audience by employing ""boo"" moments (fake scares such as when an animal darts out from behind trash cans) Demme uses what he calls ""deceptive cutting"" to enhance the tension. There are also little cues that hint at bigger dangers such as when Clarice receives a nail prick while sliding under the partially-closed door to the garage where she finds Gumbs first victim. That scene with Clarice moving slowly through a dark uncertain world populated by mannequins is one of the movies creepiest. The longer original cut (available on both the laserdisc and DVD special edition) is even more evocative as rats play a dissonant song on a piano keyboard. Another memorable moment is Clarices descent into the depths where she first meets Lecter. When she reaches the lowest level the reddish glow of Dantes hell is all around her. Demme then employs a point-of-view shot as she walks down the long hall towards Lecters cell putting us (the audience) in her position. The director also uses effective editing and reflections to emphasize the relationship between Clarice and Lecter. On one occasion the camera focuses on Clarice while Lecters face appears to hover disembodied in the air beside her. On another while Clarice tells the story of the lambs Demme switches back and forth between close-ups of Clarices tortured visage and Lecters eager one. This is the scene that creates the strongest ties between them. Lecter sees that Clarice needs to save one innocent lamb (in this case Buffalo Bills latest captive) to redeem herself and he gives her the information that will allow her to do so. Demme has stated that from the first he wanted to be faithful to Thomas Harris text so he worked with screenwriter Ted Tally to keep more than just the essence of the novel in the final version of the film. The result is a thriller with no sex no gratuitous nudity and no overt romance (although its impossible to deny that theres some sort of attraction between Clarice and Lecter and Clarice and Crawford - her two ""father figures""). There are no car crashes traditional chases or stunts yet the level of suspense remains high. For this the credit must go to everyone involved in the production from the director and actors to the technical staff. Since its 1991 release much has been written about The Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lecter Clarice Starling and the relationship between them. Thomas Harris was so intrigued by the characters that he wrote the sequel Hannibal which soared into the top spot on best-seller lists countrywide as soon as it was released. The motion picture follow-up directed by Ridley Scott and starring Hopkins and Julianne Moore (replacing Foster) is set to open on the 10th anniversary of the release of The Silence of the Lambs. If its half as involving it will be a success. The Silence of the Lambs may not have been the best thriller of the year but it was the most chilling and creepy and theres no denying that the most celebrated aspect of the film - the Clarice/Hannibal connection - could not have been accomplished with greater skill.

"The Silence of the Lambs (R) This movie won Oscars for Best Picture; Director (Jonathan Demme); Actor (Anthony Hopkins); Actress (Jodie Foster); and Adapted Screenplay The Silence of the Lambs (R) By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer February 15 1991 In ""The Silence of the Lambs"" Anthony Hopkins looks like a wine connoisseur as he tilts his head extends his nostrils and delicately inhales the scent of visitor Jodie Foster. After correctly identifying her skin cream he informs her ""Sometimes you use LAir du Temps but not today."" But this brilliant demented psychiatrist is not in a restaurant or a winery. Nor is he smelling FBI agent Foster with heterosexual interest. Hes in prison behind a maximum-security plastic shield for acts of cannibalism. To Hopkins Fosters fragrance wafting through breathing holes in the glass is the bouquet of a potentially lovely meal. This is the kind of character creepiness that Jonathan Demmes gripping cat-and-mouse thriller indulges in. A smart restrained entertainment it doesnt splash around in blood and hysteria. It doesnt have to. The menace exists in small places in Hopkinss eyes or in the threat posed by ""Buffalo Bill"" a serial killer so named for his signature carving up of victims. The wave of killings is what brings Foster to Hopkinss lair. Dispatched by special agent Scott Glenn the fledgling Fed has come to solicit the genius-monster for psychological insights. But Foster is dealing with a predatory intelligence capable of running rings around her. Her guilelessness as Glenn tells her is her only protection. Normally associated with more eccentric freewheeling fare Demme switches gears successfully from ""Something Wild"" to something eerie. With trusty cameraman Tak Fujimoto he refrains from predictable stylishness plasmatic reds and murky shadows. Instead he gives ""Lambs"" a surprisingly bright appearance so that the horrors occur as it were in broad natural daylight. He builds the suspense in sure strategic steps The face-to-face meetings between Foster and Hopkins are nostril-hair close the camera cuts rapidly between them. A scene in which Foster searches through a storage room which has not been opened in 10 years is expertly scaring. Demme also places the gruesome in uncomfortably strategic spots At one point a Buffalo Bill victim awaiting certain death at the bottom of a well discovers a bloodied fingernail stuck on the rocky wall. The implication is far more horrifying than the actuality. Although the Demme-isms are scarce there are touches only he could have come up with. A Tom Petty song -- ostensibly on the car radio of a murder quarry -- is played in its entirety mainly because well Demme likes the song. At another point Foster consults a wonderfully dorky cross-eyed bug expert. ""You mean this is like a clue from a real murder case?"" he says. ""Coo-wol"" But Demmes primary focus is the interplay between Foster and Hopkins. As the eager beaver determined to solve this mystery and who slowly begins to take charge Foster carries the right mixture of determination and vulnerability (which is where the significance of the title kicks in). Hopkins meanwhile plays his part with the kind of frosty clipped authority only the British seem capable of pulling off. ""Best thing for him really"" says this macabre sociopath when he hears about the death of a former patient. ""His therapy was going nowhere.""

"The Silence of the Lambs (R) This movie won Oscars for Best Picture; Director (Jonathan Demme); Actor (Anthony Hopkins); Actress (Jodie Foster); and Adapted Screenplay The Silence of the Lambs (R) By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer February 14 1991 ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is delicious with foreboding a masterly suspense thriller that toys with our anticipation like a well-fed cat. Adroitly directed by Jonathan Demme it lurks about the exquisite edge of horror before finally leaping into an unholy maw of bloody bones and self-awareness. Based on the lurid bestseller by Thomas Harris the film is slave to the novels plot but in spirit it goes beyond its grisly text to become a mesmerizing diabolical retelling of beauty and the beast. At its most compelling it is not a whodunit but an unsettling tango between a tender FBI trainee and an unspeakably dangerous sociopath. And so its Valentines Day release is horribly appropriate. Jodie Foster her face a quiet mirror of her inner turmoil becomes the screens most admirable heroine as Clarice Starling a fledgling agent handpicked by her mentor Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to find a notorious serial killer. But to do so she must first win the help of the even more pathological Dr. Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter a psychiatrist with quicksilver cunning and the unfortunate habit of devouring his patients. Anthony Hopkins relishes his portrait of the cultured psychiatrist with a chop-licking amorality enjoyed only by carnivores. Not only does he get to chew up the scenery but various extras. Held in a hospital for the criminally insane Lecter is kept in a plastic cage to prevent his nipping his keepers. ""Are you ever his taste"" one observes as the diminutive agent walks gravely into the madmans den. A dank clanking dungeon -- thanks to the wonderful sound men -- the walls fairly thrum with the heartbeat of Hades. Clarice may recall the canaries they send into the mines to test the air but she knowingly goes to face not only the monster but his medicine. Locked away these many years Lecter not only hungers for flesh but misses his medical practice. And he talks Clarice into a dangerous game of quid pro quo information about the psychology of a killer on the loose known as Buffalo Bill in exchange for a revelation about her secret self. While not the garden variety bond between doctor and patient or Holmes and Watson it works in its rude way. There remains however another beast in this kingdom -- the deranged transvestite Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) a sicko who places a moths chrysalis in his victims throats after first killing and skinning them. In most thrillers this would be a showy role but by the time Buffalo Bill makes his mincing entrance weve seen Hannibal at chow time. Under Demmes direction and photographer Tak Fujimotos camera the mood is not only clinical but compassionate. Even an invasive autopsy on one of Bills casualties seems like some sorrowful last rite for the poor plump girl. Its the scene that sends Clarice back to Lecter more determined than ever to rescue a senators daughter (Brooke Smith) currently held by Buffalo Bill. A scrappy young woman she is refreshingly capable of gaining some control over this impossible situation. As adapted by Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally the story manages a feminist perspective without turning Clarice into some phallic Nancy Drew. Neither boyish nor overtly sexual she solves her crimes very much as a cerebral young woman would with brainpower and more than the ordinary allotment of gumption. This is not a movie about sex but gender a story of Electra among the father figures all of them in one way or another dangerous and devouring. But mostly ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is just plain scary -- from its doomed and woozy camera angles to its creepy Freudian subtext. It scares like some Poevian raven croaking a warning perched in the night over the chamber door. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is rated R for violence and profanity.

But the most exciting presence in the film is Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the brilliant incarcerated psychopath who agrees to help her in her search. Lecter lives deep within the bowels of a Baltimore institution for the criminally insane. When Clarice first goes to see him descending into the darkened grungy brick corridor reserved for the hospitals most dangerous and deranged patients she seems to be entering some medieval version of hell. At the very end of the corridor behind an impenetrable clear-plastic wall stands Lucifer himself Lecter the psychiatrist who liked to murder people and then eat them or at least their vital organs (thus his nickname Hannibal the Cannibal). We in the audience along with Clarice are geared to expect a bone-chilling monster the maniac cutthroat of all time. Instead the middle-aged man who stands before us is handsome in a soothing almost fatherly way his big bright eyes gazing out at the world with exquisite sensitivity. Lecters dark hair is slicked straight back and his stocky upper body which is clad in a skintight T-shirt is calm yet poised as though he were about to perform gymnastic feats. Theres a touch of androgyny in his ironically serene presence; hes at once virile and soft like a ballet dancer. And when he begins to talk the words that come out are seamless playful and as thrillingly seductive as a dancers movements. Raising his nostrils to the air holes in his transparent wall he quickly identifies the kind of skin cream Clarice uses as well as her perfume -- even though she hasnt worn it for at least a day. Lecter you see is a genius of perception (especially when it comes to his olfactory powers). Hes a kind of twisted Sherlock Holmes able to absorb with heightened Zen-like detachment everything that goes on around him and to draw visionary inferences from the mass of data his senses take in. Hopkins always one of the most dynamic of British actors gives the performance of his life. He delivers his lines in a rapid-fire hush but his eyes in a running counterpoint are impish amused and almost subliminally knowing as though some pleasurable otherworldly light were passing through them. We can sense that savagery and tenderness coexist in Lecter that they grow out of the same directness of spirit. What makes the character so prickly and fascinating is that as the movie presents it his homicidal impulses are a natural extension of his intelligence his ability to appreciate peoples most intimate qualities. Lecter seeks complete knowledge of everyone he encounters By killing people and eating them he literally consumes their identities. Clarice has been assigned by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the FBIs Behavioral Science Unit to submit Lecter to a standardized questionnaire. What Crawford really wants though is Lecters help in apprehending Buffalo Bill a sicko who has been murdering women and skinning them. Crawford figures that Clarice because shes a novice (and extremely attractive) will bring Lecter out in a way that a more experienced agent couldnt. But Clarice turns out to be savvier than he expected. Her girlish ingenuousness does get to Lecter but so does her sharp intuitive mind since thats what he values most in a person. Intrigued and infatuated Lecter sets a deal in motion. Tell me about yourself he tells Clarice Reveal your secrets your fears your soul and Ill look over the evidence and help you find Buffalo Bill. The Silence of the Lambs jumps between their conversations Clarices investigation into the killings and scenes set inside the anonymous small-town lair of Buffalo Bill a.k.a. Jame Gumb (Ted Levine) a would-be transsexual who is keeping his latest prey alive in a dungeon-like hole in the basement. This is the second screen adaptation of one of Thomas Harris best-selling serial-killer novels. The first director Michael Manns 1986 Manhunter (based on Harris Red Dragon) had a druggy saturnine intensity; I thought it was the most disturbing -- and mesmerizing -- thriller of the past decade. The Silence of the Lambs is a far less unsettling movie in part because Demme has toned down the awfulness of the killers scheme. In the book Buffalo Bills systematic skinning of his victims had a gruesome logic (he literally wanted to wear a womans torso). Here his taxidermic ambitions have been made somewhat more vague and so we arent hit with the full shocking horror of what Clarice is up against. I got the feeling that Demme didnt want to spend too many scenes exploring the diseased mind of a misogynist psychopath. Yet artistically speaking his reticence may have been a mistake. No other pop novelist has gotten as far inside the heads of serial killers as Thomas Harris does. The Silence of the Lambs would have been harder to shake off had it been crazier and less ""moral"" -- less of a feminist outcry over the violence perpetrated against women. For all that Demme has created a supremely sensuous and hypnotic thriller one thats likely to become his first major hit. He brings Harris sensationalistic material an emotional charge virtually unheard of in this genre. Jodie Foster has sometimes projected too much intellectual avidity for the characters shes playing (that was true of both The Accused and her overrated teen-hooker turn in Taxi Driver). Here though her bright-eyed alertness is just whats called for and it takes on an almost lyrical quality. Sporting a Southern accent she gives Clarice a brisk no-nonsense attitude and beneath that a beguiling blend of curiosity and fear. Clarice never seems more accomplished than a freshman overachiever yet were also convinced that shes daring enough to lock eyes with a lethal game-player like Lecter. The movie takes its eerie resonance from the bond between these two. The bond works because Lecter as Hopkins plays him remains weirdly perversely likable -- despite the fact that hell tear peoples faces off when given the opportunity. It works as well because Clarices openness with Lecter isnt sentimentalized; its shown to be part of what makes her a good detective. When she tells him that as a girl she once came upon the unendurable sound of lambs being slaughtered and that the event has haunted her ever since shes letting down all her defenses. In that moment Lecter gets to partake of Clarices identity without killing her. At the same time hes doing her a favor offering her a cathartic look in the mirror. What Clarice and Lecter share is a desire for something that few besides born detectives would ever seek the full horrifying knowledge of human darkness.
