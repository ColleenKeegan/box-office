"Fast amp; Furious 6 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fast-furious-6 ) Fast amp; Furious 6 (United States 2013) May 24 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli ""Mindless entertainment"" thats a phrase that will be repeated often enough in association with Fast amp; Furious 6 which exists purely to showcase how idiotically over-the-top action sequences can become when annoyances like gravity are tossed to the side. As far as the description goes Ill agree wholeheartedly with ""mindless"" which is less of an opinion than a statement of fact. ""Entertainment"" is in the eye of the beholder. For me watching Fast amp; Furious 6 was more work than fun. Theres enough stupidity in movies these days that it seems counterproductive to celebrate it. Fast amp; Furious 6 delivers almost everything anticipated from it so its difficult to complain that it doesnt satisfy expectations. For those who loved the previous installments enjoyment of this one is almost a slam-dunk. For those who like me have had reservations about the series as a whole this installment provides little in the way of optimism. Fast amp; Furious 6 doesnat vary much from the things that have made the franchise popular fast cars women in bikinis and PG-13 action. That means lots of pointless chases/races that are more often routine than exciting fights that go on and on and on with promises of resolution only in the final fifteen minutes and a lot of CGI-enhanced stunts. To the joint credit of director Justin Lin and Universal Pictures this isnt in 3-D. Thats probably because the amount of fast-cutting necessary to piece together the action sequences doesnt lend itself to the format. Fast amp; Furious 6s stunt work has largely been assembled in post-production with machine-gun editing and computer-aided special effects accomplishing things that no live human could achieve. As is typical of this approach it can be difficult figuring out whats going on during segments of the fight and/or chase scenes but some viewers deem this visual chaos to be a benefit. Fast amp; Furious 6 boasts a few intriguing action set-ups. A chase with a tank barreling down a freeway is unique although the ending is so over-the-top that is crosses the line into self-parody. Its laugh-aloud funny and Ill give Lin enough credit to believe this was intentional. If not then he has miscalculated. For the most part Fast amp; Furious 6 comes across much like a live action cartoon. With the threat of death effectively removed (now that a previously killed character has returned to life) and gravity sent on holiday every time theres an action sequence theres no reason to worry about negative consequences for the good guys. Okay so one or two of them might meet the Grim Reaper but if theyre popular enough theyll be back for another outing. The plot feels like warmed-over bad James Bond. Think of the worst 007 outing and the story still holds together better than this. The underlying premise is that a top British criminal Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) is in the process of gathering the components for what will be when assembled a doomsday weapon worth several billion dollars. A member of Shaws crew is none other than Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) previously thought dead and now conveniently afflicted with amnesia. When her ex-lover Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) learns that shes alive he agrees to work with special agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and his ass-kicking female cohort Riley (Gina Carano) to bring in Shaw. Dom re-assembles his team including best bud Brian OConnor (Paul Walker) and everyone heads off to London. In Fast amp; Furious 6 the only thing dumber than the plot is the dialogue. Character development never a strong suit in the series has been largely eliminated from this one in keeping with the cartoon flavor. In the previous Fast amp; Furious movies whether good bad or indifferent at least attempts were made to do something with the characters. Here everything is disappointingly perfunctory. Dom Brian Letty and the rest might as well be CGI animated characters for all the personality they show. None of the returning actors bring much to the production. Vin Diesel and The Rock engage in a contest to see who can scowl more convincingly. Paul Walker has given up trying to do anything more than play Diesels sidekick. Rodriguez makes us wonder why they felt it was desirable to bring back her character (beyond providing a post-credits jolt to Fast 5). The only one who seems invested in his role is newcomer Luke Evans - his villain is both energetic and intelligent (the only time Ill use the latter word in association with this movie). For action junkies its useful to compare Fast amp; Furious 6 with something like Dredd or The Raid Redemption. Those of course are real action films with hardcore fight scenes and equally over-the-top excursions into mayhem. The difference is that Dredd and The Raid Redemption offer a level of excitement and energy thats lacking from Fast amp; Furious 6. Theyre visceral. They elevate the pulse. Its all in style and delivery (and undoubtedly the ability to offer R-rated violence has something to do with it). Watching Dredd and The Raid Redemption I felt like I was viewing a movie. Watching Fast amp; Furious 6 I felt like I was watching a video game that would have been more fun if I was playing. Fast amp; Furious 6 will earn millions upon millions of dollars because this kind of ""mindless entertainment"" appeals to least-common denominator audiences. Despite some puzzling choices along the way the franchise has endured and now offers a recognizable brand. Some entries are better than others. While the wildly implausible action sequences in Fast amp; Furious 6 are on par with those of its predecessors the in-between material is substantially weaker indicating that the movie perhaps should have completely ignored a plot and just offered 90 minutes of non-stop uncorrelated action. This isnt the worst Fast amp; Furious but its not the best either. Yet it delivers the cartoonish action it promises and offers a crackling cliff-hanger so Fast amp; Furious 7 is a given.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie American cars may not be killer exports but a certain 12-year-old action franchise about muscle cars and the men and women who put pedal to metal has been making a killing overseas for years. The global appeal of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" series has become entwined with its storytelling. As the characters and plots have gone globe-trotting -- Tokyo Rio and in ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" London Spain and Moscow -- so have the box-office grosses. A quick example 2011s ""Fast Five"" made more than 200 million domestic and double that in foreign box office. The world it appears speaks Dominic Torettos laconic tongue. In many ways this trend would seem to rebuff the studio-exec wisdom that says faces of color dont travel well abroad. After all has there ever been a cast of quasi-heroic rebels quite so multihued -- the original ""Mod Squad"" ensemble excepted? When last we saw Dom (Vin Diesel) Brian (Paul Walker) and their crew they were in Rio de Janeiro mixing it up with drug lords vexing a pumped-up fed named Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and getting away with 100 million. Now the fugitives have scattered Brothers-in-law Dom and Brian live within racing distance of each other and their respective mates -- Brazilian widow Elena (Elsa Pataky) and Mia (original cast member Jordana Brewster) -- in the Spanish Canary Islands. Brian and Mia are new parents. Dom has settled into a tinkering domesticity. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is flying high. Tech geek Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) resembles a retired Robin Hood in Costa Rica. Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot) flirt with what passes for them as settling down. Looks like the appealing punks who once ruled L.A.s street races have matured. Arguably the greatest fuel this franchise runs on after Diesel has been director Justin Lin. He first got behind the wheel for 2006s "" The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift"" which pitted American muscle car aficionados against Japanese racers with a fondness for Nissans and nitrous-oxide boosts. This is his fourth go-round and its clear he loves his collection of endearing riff-raff. He gives them so many opportunities to love each other. One of the tugs of ""6"" is its theme of people having your back come what may. This code is challenged as Dom amp; Co. face a bizarro version of themselves headed by former mercenary Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). The lethal Brit has his own crew of multiethnic elite racers including one who looks awfully familiar to Dom and franchise fans. In the hallowed tradition of the daytime soap opera writer Chris Morgan brings back original street racer Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) from the dead. She has amnesia cant recall her beloveds but still knows how to rebuild a V8. Johnson delivers Hobbs lines with maximum clunk. Some of that stiffness is intentional This fed isnt cool exactly. Most of it is clumsy writing. But who cares what Hobbs is saying? Were mesmerized by the veins coiling his biceps. Johnsons delivery makes Diesels monotones appear a work of artistry. And one of the wonders of the Famp;F originals is how deftly they handle lug-wrench dialogue. Some of the action sequences are insane. No really. Absurd impossible physics defying triage-required stuff. No matter. Thats the foolish rush of a franchise that must go faster and faster and furiouser and furiouser.

How you feel about ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" is a matter of perspective. While a middle-age egghead might note that a series that started out as a harmless cars-and-girls fantasy has devolved into a full-blown assault on human intelligence a young thrill seeker would say that this sequel is the awesomest action movie since ""Iron Man 3."" And our young friend would have a point.Director Justin Lin who took over the franchise for the third episode (""Tokyo Drift"") has become a world-class orchestrator of mechanical mayhem. Of course he has access to some world-class hardware starting with stars Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. These two meat machines take the place of actual human beings whose feelings and frailties would kill the buzz.While street-racer Dominic Toretto (Diesel) is nesting in the Canary Islands with his share of the 100 million heist from episode 5 he gets an unwelcome visit from beefy federal agent Hobbs (Johnson). Hobbs says a British commando-turned-terrorist named Shaw (Luke Evans an underwhelming villain) has assembled most of the parts for a ""tech bomb"" that could disable the infrastructure of any nation on earth. The feds need a team of daredevils to stop Shaw from stealing the final component. When Toretto points out that he and ex-cop Brian OConner (Paul Walker) are retired -- and out of the reach of U.S. law enforcement -- Hobbs informs him that Shaws gang includes Torettos sweetheart Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who was presumably killed a couple movies ago.Faster than you can say ""code of honor"" OConner leaves his wife and newborn baby behind as Toretto reassembles the six-person team (which also includes Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as the fearless lovebirds and Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris as the bickering buddies). Working with Hobbs the tech-savvy team tracks Shaw from London (where the scent of street-racing groupies leads Toretto to the amnesiac Letty) to Spain (where Shaws goons use a tank to hijack the billion-dollar whatchamacallit on an elevated freeway at rush hour). Theres also a detour to California so OConner can pad the movies punch count against the Mexican drug lord who put Letty in the hospital. And then this mountain of mindless entertainment is topped with a cars-versus-cargo-plane finale on what seems to be the worlds longest runway. Counting the inevitable hot-dog party and a credit-sequence tease for episode 7 this ad for the miraculous power of seat belts runs two hours and 10 minutes. Which might not be fast enough for the furious old critic in the back seat.What ""Fast amp; Furious 6""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 210  Content Intense sequence of violent action and mayhem plus strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Sung Kang (from left) Ludacris Gal Gadot Vin Diesel Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson in ""Fast and Furious 6.""Story highlightsThe ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise is back for round 6This go around the action takes place mostly in LondonEach of the extended cast get their moment to shineDrawing level with the ""Star Wars"" saga and pulling well ahead of ""Shrek"" ""Ice Age"" and ""Spider-Man"" in the sequel stakes ""The Fast and the Furious"" could yet challenge Rocky Balboa Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger for longevity. So whats the appeal? Combining heist movie suspense with regular high-speed chase action ""Fast and Furious"" takes ""Oceans 11"" downtown swapping con men for street racers suits for vests and hair gel for grease (Vin Diesel Dwayne Johnson and Tyrese Gibson are all chrome domes now). Where Steven Soderbergh aimed for suave and sophisticated this unpretentious franchise sticks with stunts and sweatpants. But unlike Michael Bay who ham-fistedly satirized a testosterone-fueled abs and EZ-money gym culture in ""Pain and Gain"" these pumped up B-movies arent condescending to their multiethnic working-class characters or their audience. Instead they celebrate the loyalty and brotherhood of that outlaw extended family unit the gang. These criminals dont have time for traffic regulations but they still operate under a strict code of their own a code that echoes Alexandre Dumas famous motto for ""The Three Musketeers"" All for one and one for all. Under director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan (who has penned the last four episodes) the series has hit on a mock-serious car-toony groove thats hard to resist. Even Michelle Rodriguez who was killed in the fourth flick is back in ""Furious 6"" a hook to lure Dominic Toretto and crew out of retirement and onto Special Agent Hobbs team. Rodriguezs Letty has been spotted riding in a looky-likey criminal outfit (""Theyre our evil twins"") led by a ruthless ex-British Special Forces soldier Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). If Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) help Hobbs take Shaw down they can win immunity for Letty and for themselves. Set largely in London -- congestion-plagued Brits will scoff at a street race that loops around Piccadilly Circus and wonder how many pedestrians were sacrificed in the making of this movie -- the film imports a James Bond-style threat in the form of a military ""Night Shade"" device. The device is the kind of thing that cannot be allowed to fall into the wrong hands (which Shaws definitely are.) JUST WATCHEDVin Diesels many Facebook friendsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVin Diesels many Facebook friends 0010If the set up is farfetched and the acting more willing than able you have to give the producers credit for putting the budget up on the screen. Each of the extended cast gets his or her moment to shine and whether its Tyrese Gibson and Chris Bridges trading quips Sung Kang and Gal Gadot shooting flirty looks or Rodriguez duking it out with ""Haywire"" alum Gina Carano in a convincingly crunchy catfight there may well be something for just about anyone here. But its the action set pieces everyone will be talking about. And if ""Fast 5"" set the bar pretty high with that train stunt and the safe-dragging climax ""Furious 6"" is more than ready to up the ante with still bigger and clunkier modes of transportation. I dont want to say too much but for some reason I kept having flashbacks to ""Toy Story 2"" during the preposterously elongated climax. (Not a criticism just that you wouldnt be surprised if Woody rode to the rescue on Bullseye in one of the outtakes.) Ludicrous but undeniably fun and surprisingly affectionate this is really all you could ask of a car crash movie and more. Stick through the end credits for a satisfying coda.

Some people have never seen a single Star Wars film. Others couldnt tell you the difference between Doctor McCoy and Mr. Scott or what makes a hobbit distinct from a dwarf. Even among film critics we who attempt to see and educate ourselves on as many far-flung corners of the cinematic universe as humanly possible there are (sometimes embarrassing) gaps.Me? When this week started Id never seen any films in the now-hexalogy that is The Fast and the Furious the series that has grown from humble beginnings as a movie about muscle-bound muscle-car racers into a hugely successful and well-known action franchise. Well-known but not to me. That situation has been rectified though In one punishing 12-hour stretch I caught up on over a decade of speed fury hulking pecs and piercing blue eyes. Related Story A Field Guide to Blockbuster Season 22 Films to See This Summer Seeing these six films in what was essentially a single sitting (I did need to leave the house much to my couchs relief to see the most recent installment) left me feeling like Id spent half a day inhaling exhaust fumes. But Im not going to blame the Fast/Furious series for that. Its entirely possible that my inability to focus on something so simple as a game of Words With Friends afterwards could have happened after any six movies watched end to end. I shouldnt have been surprised that I passed out on the couch immediately after returning from the screening of Fast amp; Furious 6 and didnt wake until dawn bleary-eyed and head spinning.The marathon did offer up some actual surprises not least of which was how quickly most of those 12 hours passed.Say what you want about The Fast and the Furious movies. Call them big dumb loud ridiculously implausible distractingly melodramatic and annoyingly repetitive. I wont disagree with any of that. If I had to watch one more overwrought Vin Diesel scene featuring his Dom Toretto growling sad-eyed and solemn about the importance of family I might have disowned my own just out of spite. But after speeding through these films with the fast-burning intensity of a nitrous-infused engine I can now understand the appeal of this series which has made 1.5 billion so far and shows no signs of slowing down. Not only that Ill likely turn out eagerly for the next installment.Thats not to say these are masterpieces. The 2001 debut The Fast and the Furious is a pretty generic action flick a fine enough diversion but hardly the sort of thing one would expect to spawn a long-running dynasty. The sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious already made it seem like the series had reached a dead end having packed in more neon lights and drug-dealing swagger than every Miami Vice script combined. Its practically unwatchable. I can pinpoint the exact moment near the start of the third film Tokyo Drift when my thoughts began to do some drifting of their own wondering if this whole endeavor might have been ill-advised. One character throws a baseball at a cars rear window and despite it leaving a nice round hole in the glass and obviously going into the car the next shot shows the ball landing on the pavement next to the car. If the filmmakers have given up caring about such basic continuity only a few minutes into the third installment in the series the rest of this day was going to be really long.As it turned out the third film is just self-consciously silly gleefully ripping off the Karate Kid but subbing driving skills for martial arts. It features none of the cast of the previous films in anything other than a cameo and to some extent feels like a desperate attempt to switch things up in a franchise already running on empty. But by the end its not so bad really We do get a welcome break from the ceaselessly steely gaze of series regular Paul Walker and Tokyo Drift finally boasts a director in Justin Lin with the knack for inventive car sequences that a series about street racing deserves.Little did I know that the stylistic shifts of Tokyo Drift would barely register compared to what the series had in store in the fifth film. Unfortunately to get there I did have to endure No. 4 simply titled Fast and Furious as if the producers were so tired that they could no longer even be bothered with definite articles or numbers. Its still not as terrible as 2 Fast but its more forgettable. Going into this marathon my biggest worry was that all of these movies would just fuse together in my mind into an unrecognizable blob of metal smoking rubber and asphalt. For the most part that didnt happen--except in the case of Fast and Furious the plot points of which my brain keeps trying to stick into other movies.But then something remarkable happens. The producers make a conscious shift away from the car culture that has defined it in an attempt to widen the audience. Series regulars and past favorites like Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson return to create an Avengers-style supergroup of heist artists and Dwayne Johnson shows up as their perfect authoritarian foil. Its a market-driven decision but pays off artistically. Fast Five released a decade after the first movie not only reinvigorates the series commercial prospects but accomplishes something far more vital It saves the last five hours of my movie-watching from becoming a slog through mediocrity. But then something remarkable happens Series regulars and past favorites like Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson return to create an Avengers-style supergroup of heist artists. Its a market-driven decision but pays off artistically.Fast amp; Furious Six continues on in the same vein and may just be my favorite of the lot which is a pretty astounding feat. After 10 hours of watching the same characters many of the same situations and way too many shots of sleek street racers here I was rapt with attention for two more hours as the team now nimbly transformed from heist artists to mercenaries.So what did I learn from the day I devoted to The Fast and the Furious? That Paul Walkers crystal blue eyes are dreamy? That Dwayne Johnson pretty much makes any movie hes in better? That its possible for film series to actually improve with age? That car chases with practical effects and real stunt drivers are still more thrilling than most CGI spectacles? That staring at a screen for 12 hours will make you more tired than actually getting outside and doing something with your day? All of these things sure. But theres a more important takeaway. I generally enjoy even the cheesiest of action flicks but for some reason I spent years rolling my eyes at the impending release of each sequel in this series without having seen a single one. Now though not only do I not consider it a day wasted or lost but Id actually call myself a fan. It just goes to show that you should never judge a car until youve had a look at whats under the hood.

This Week Is Historical for Another ReasonnextAmericas Top Colleges Have a Rich-Kid Problem Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 65 Id Like to Hear His Wife Say Something James Fallows None The most personally moving and most fundamentally patriotic moment of the Democratic National Convention was the appearance by the bereaved parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan and the statement about the meaning of their sons life and death and about the Constitution by Mr. Khizr Khan. After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Fast amp; Furious 6 Share Comment The ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise has received a fair amount of coverage in recent years for its semi-accidental emergence as a standard for unaffected movie multiculturalism. For their own part Vin Diesel and the ""Famp;F"" handlers seem eager to assert how theyve molded a series of installments into yep a saga complete with expansive twisty continuity. None of which is really the reason that were turning out for ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" of course. Matter-of-fact progressiveness and Michelle Rodriguezs screen resurrection are swell but hows the stunt driving? Director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan back for their fourth outing certainly do show enthusiasm for mining ""the story so far."" (All thats missing is a ""Star Wars""-y opening crawl.)

(Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures/AP) Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker in a scene from Fast amp; Furious 6.(Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures/AP) Fast and Furious 6 Just think of it as a soap opera Add to ... Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 24 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 24 2013 153PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Justin Lin Written by Chris Morgan Starring Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Luke Evans Michelle Rodriguez Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English Twelve years and a half-dozen speedometer-busting adventures later the Fast amp; Furious franchise is still going strong. To borrow a bit of stunt-car parlance made famous by Quentin Tarantino we might say that the brand is Death Proof. How else to explain the presence in Justin Lins film of Michelle Rodriguez last seen taking a fatal bullet two sequels ago? The sudden resurrection of a fallen heroine- and the fact that shes been saddled with a convenient case of amnesia - confirms that what began as a straight-up gear-head action-flick series has morphed into something akin to a soap opera - call it Guiding Tail Lights. Multimedia Fast amp; Furious 6 The official trailer As the film opens Rodriguezs Letty - the longtime main squeeze of virtuoso thief Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) - has been spotted by government agents keeping company with some very bad dudes a team of elite stunt-driving thieves bent on stealing a powerful electronic gadget. Their leader Shaw (Luke Evans) is a British-accented mastermind who talks a lot about living by a code which makes him an excellent foil for Dom who has a similarly rigorous worldview. The difference is that Shaw believes in keeping his associates expendable while Dom has avuncular attachments to his associates His former rival Brian OConner (Paul Walker) is his brother-in-law having long since married Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and driven off into the Italian sunset.""It doesnt feel like home"" moans Brian of his sun-dappled exile referring to the fact that at the end of Fast Five he and the rest of Doms team were forced there by federal DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) a reluctant ally who so appreciated their help in bringing down a vicious drug lord that he let them flee to non-extradition countries with 100-million of the dealers money. Hobbs shows up early in Fast amp; Furious 6 with a cant-refuse offer for Dom and Co. Help him track down Shaw - and by proxy Letty - and theyll all be welcome back on American soil. Decamping to London to head off the villains Dom Brian and the rest - including tech expert Tej (Chris Bridges) and fast-living power couple Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot) - find themselves initially overmatched against a crew whose members are basically cracked-mirror versions of themselves - an amusing conceit that Chris Morgans screenplay leaves underdeveloped.That the movie is so indifferently written shouldnt really be a surprise. The dialogue is just there to mark time between the set pieces and its nice to report that Lin has outdone himself in that department. A freewheeling assault on a military convoy on a Spanish highway unfolds with the gleeful physics-defying abandon of a 10-year-old smashing his beloved model cars together while a subway tunnel fistfight between Letty and Hobbs taciturn right-hand woman (MMA star Gina Carano) is one of the best smackdowns in recent memory.Some actors do a better job of standing out against the chaos; Johnson has genuine star presence and looks right in his element leaping from speeding cars and head-butting henchmen. The post-end-credits introduction of another bullet-headed genre-flick icon as the possible villain for the next instalment (already slated for production) means that Johnson may finally get a worthy foil.

"Fast and Furious 6 takes the road more trampled review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFast and Furious 6 takes the road more trampled reviewFast and Furious 6 will reward die-hard fans of the franchise. But so-so acting script and even action scenes will leave others in neutral. Dwayne Johnson and Gina Carano walk away from apparent carnage in Fast and Furious 6.  (Giles Keyte / Universal)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentFri. May 24 2013Fast amp; Furious 6Starring Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez. Directed by Justin Lin. 130 minutes. Opens May 24 at major theatres. PGThe two Fs in Fast amp; Furious 6 might also stand for ""familiar"" and ""family.""Yep lovers of the Famp;F franchise will doubtlessly be pleased to see the whole famn damily reassembled including Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who was killed off in the fourth installment of the high-octane series but returns as the memory-challenged moll of 6s super-villain Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) an ex-British Special Forces soldier turned international terrorist.Article Continued BelowThe cast of old familiar faces includes Roman and Han and Gisele and Tej and Mia and Brian (Paul Walker) who once again plays second fiddle to Dominic Toretto (the follicle-challenged gravel-voiced Vin Diesel). Even the villain Braga from Famp;F4 returns in a brief cameo. (Do fans really demand this degree of plot continuity?) This time the ""family"" -- as Dominic refers to them repeatedly -- is being offered a chance at redemption (a return to the good ol U.S. of A with their criminal records wiped clean) as long as they help Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stop Shaw from assembling a ""Nightshade"" bomb. (We are assured this would be a very bad thing.)""It just doesnt feel like home"" laments ex-FBI agent Brian despite living in the lap of luxury on the Canary Islands with Mia and their newborn son. (Among the amenities offered no extradition treaty and being able to race along Gran Canarias scenic but precariously narrow coastal highway at dangerous speeds.)The team has gone increasingly international -- Brazil Japan Mexico -- since its humble beginnings on the mean streets of L.A. This time out theyre off to London which fortuitously has its own active underground street-racing scene despite -- were reminded -- having more traffic cameras per square kilometre than any metropolis on the planet.Theres plenty of shop talk for the car buffs who keep coming back for each installment -- sequential transmissions magnetic suspensions and twin turbo V8s yada yada -- as well as loads of inane dialogue in the form of macho trash talk and pseudo-philosophy.To wit ""If you keep running your pie hole youre going to get an ass-kicking."" ""Youve really got to check that emotion. Your voice just went from Shaggy to Scooby Doo."" ""Show me how you drive Ill show you who you are.""Diesel delivers his usual deadpan performance with an occasional horsey grin to break up the monotony while glassy blue-eyed Walker seems content to play it as low-key as possible barely registering on screen. The always watchable Dwayne Johnson delivers more brawn and bravado than the other two put together.Unfortunately Luke Evans turn as the villain is a tepid one an example of undue restraint in a film where excess is the standard.It pretty much goes without saying that the script by Chris Morgan who penned most of the previous installments is achingly stupid and beyond ludicrous. Director Justin Lin helming his fourth Famp;F project seems content to focus on the car racing and action scenes. (Hes already bowed out on Famp;F7 to be replaced by Saw director James Wan which is already in pre-production. And why not? The series has racked up more than 1 billion at the box office.)Thats a bit unfortunate because theres a sense of ennui and missed opportunities despite all the motorway mayhem martial arts action gunplay and a protracted ending that features not one but two climactic chases. Since weve all waited so long -- more than two hours -- couldnt Lin have dispatched his villains in a more fittingly gory manner?That said fans are clearly more interested in car chases than character development and coherent plotting and this installment is sure to satisfy their need for overdrive action. The rest of us are more likely to be stuck in neutral.

The appeal of the genre has always been its simplicity Greasers racing for pink slips their muscle cars grinding and screeching and speeding into the horizon. The Fast and the Furious has moved the genre into the digital era replacing the force of metal against metal with the unreal bobbing and weaving of an arcade game. And now at five sequels and counting its become freighted with the mythology of a George R.R. Martin series with characters and incidents cobbled together like so many spare parts under a giant chassis. The 2011 entry Fast Five intelligently accommodated the bloat by bringing the gang together for an Oceans Eleven-style heist in Rio. The streamlined plot had the effect of channeling the series excesses into a handful of giddily over-the-top action set pieces. The CGI ballet of flying sports cars and twisted wreckage may insult the physics of gear head classics -- to say nothing of the laws of Isaac Newton -- but no one could say director Justin Lin doesnt go full throttle. Now with the series lovable rogues dispersed to various tropical locales each living high off their share of 100 million in ill-gotten money Fast amp; Furious 6 has to find a new reason to bring them all together -- and its not nearly so graceful with the heavy lifting. Porting over a plot from some generic spy thriller Furious 6 opens with Dwayne Johnsons DDS agent from Fast Five coaxing Dominic (Vin Diesel) Brian (Paul Walker) and the rest of their crew (Tyrese Gibson Chris Bridges Sung Kang and Gal Gadot among others) out of early retirement to stop a powerful mercenary with terrorist designs. Former British Special Forces operative Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) now an underground operator with deep connections seeks a computer chip that could lead to mass destruction in the wrong hands. The authorities naturally are too weak and/or corrupt to bring him to justice. Code Switch Director Justin Lin Shifts The Identity Of Fast amp; Furious Dominic and Brian have no interest in risking their necks for Johnny Law but when its revealed that Dominics deceased former girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is actually alive and running with Shaws gang theyre eager to rescue her and bring her back into the family. (Fans will recall that Letty died in Fast amp; Furious the fourth of the series and the groundwork for her return was laid at the end of the last entry; death has about as much finality in Fast as it does in a daytime soap.) i He Believes He Can Fly This might seem a little spoilerish but come on now -- how awesome is this shot? Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures He Believes He Can Fly This might seem a little spoilerish but come on now -- how awesome is this shot? Universal Pictures Fast 6 pits Shaws crew against Dominics in a high-tech battle royale but it has a devil of a time explaining why everyone should hop into their cars. The obligatory underground racing sequence here -- in a London that looks no different from the scenes in Miami or Rio -- is such an afterthought that the big race has no finish line and no winner. Lin peppers the film with action beats including a good piece of hand-to-hand combat in a subway station but the fact is that the surveillance work necessary to track down Shaw is more practically accomplished on foot. That leaves Fast amp; Furious 6 to invest the lions share of its resources in a highway duel thats as cheerfully ridiculous as any sequence in the series. (One word tank) For a 15-minute stretch Lin and his effects team cut loose with high-speed jousting massive explosions and countless feats of derring-do no actual human could survive. Its glorious while it lasts but then the film goes back to figuring out how to keep its oversized vessel from taking on water. And thats more hard work than its worth.

Credit Giles Keyte/Universal Studios Your auto insurance policy probably has clauses specifying whether you are covered for damage from missiles falling objects riots civil war earthquakes hail radioactive contamination discharge of a nuclear weapon. But its time once again to check that it also addresses whether you are insured against accidentally driving onto the set of a ""Fast amp; Furious"" movie.If you blundered into the shooting of ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" for instance you are almost surely walking now If the flip-your-car-over speedsters didnt wreck your vehicle the giant tank surely did.Most of the familiar faces are back for this latest bacchanalia of reckless driving including Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. Toretto is relaxing in fair-weather retirement living off the big score of the previous movie in the franchise when he is called back into service as it were by Luke Hobbs the federal agent who both pursues and admires him and his band of renegades.Hobbs is again played by Dwayne Johnson and his biceps which get enough camera time that you expect the closing credits to include two arm wranglers one for each. Mr. Johnson has seemingly been in every movie released in the last two years and has a reality television show ""The Hero"" coming on TNT. But he knows how to deploy his half-dozen expressions -- the sly grin the single-eyebrow arch -- and is still a welcome sight where other actors might by this point be overexposed.He also doesnt hijack this movie the way his character did in the recent ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" ""Famp;F 6"" is still primarily about Toretto and his buddies. It is no spoiler to say that Michelle Rodriguez seemingly killed off in an earlier film returns as Letty Ortiz (shes in the opening credits) Torettos tough-as-nails love interest. The gimmick here is that shes now working for the opposition mercenaries led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Oh and she has amnesia and doesnt remember Toretto. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That provides just enough plot to propel the movie from car chase to car chase. The real question here is whether Justin Lin the director of this film and three of its predecessors can top himself. The climactic sequence of his ""Fast Five"" involved a preposterous scene in which racecars towed a giant bank vault through the streets at high speed.Here Mr. Lin offers two tricks. The bad guys have flip cars sleek machines whose armor-plated front ends are designed so that when they strike another vehicle it goes spinning through the air. And in a later chase Shaw and friends pull out a formidable tank that turns any vehicle it encounters into squished scrap metal.These flashy smashies and a climactic sequence in which the good guys try to prevent Shaw from taking off in an airliner by tethering their cars to it make the movie a satisfying thrill ride at least on a par with the earlier installments. A nice twist near the end is well disguised and a coda hints at whats to come in Part 7.""Fast amp; Furious 6"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its a dangerous-driving clinic.

AP Fast amp; Furious 6 Director Justin Lin Cast Vin Diesel Paul Walker Michelle Rodriguez Dwayne Johnson Rated PG-13 (intense violence action and mayhem; strong language; sexuality) Running time 130 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1209am on Friday May. 24 2013 Friday May. 24 2013 Friday May. 24 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram If Fast amp; Furious 6 were any dumber the script would have been written in crayon.But no one goes to any installment in this car-chase skull-bashing slam-o-rama expecting education enlightenment or heck even a story that makes any kind of sense. You go for cool cars stupid stunts (as in youd be stupid to try these at home) bone-crushing brawls that barely leave a mark and -- in the case of this sixth film -- two count em two vicious girl fights. If all of these things sound appealing then Fast amp; Furious 6 delivers handsomely. In fact in terms of sheer action adrenaline it may be the best film of the franchise.At the start of 6 our heroes are chilling out from their last crime-busting adventure in Rio covered in episode five. Brian (Paul Walker) is a new dad. Dominic (Vin Diesel) is living in sun-drenched tropical splendor with his girlfriend. Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot) are planning their life together. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is winging his way to Macao on a private jet full of young beauties. And Te j (Chris Bridges aka Ludacris) just seems mostly concerned about saving his money.But wall o man federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) drops a bomb of bad news on them. He tells Dominic that he needs to get the gang back together to nab a group of high-tech street-racing toughs who are using their nefarious skills to stage daring robberies and raids. Working under the direction of the evil Shaw (Luke Evans) a former top British soldier who has gone over to the dark side theyre after a top-secret government microchip.To add romantic insult to criminal injury Shaw has Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) a former member of Dominics dream team and his former love interest who we thought died in a previous Famp;F movie on his side. Say what?So its off to London to put a stop to Shaws madness -- and turn the citys narrow twisting streets into a death-dealing racetrack. Director Justin Lin and screenwriters Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson all veterans of the ""Famp;F"" franchise wisely keep dialogue and plot to a bare enough minimum to qualify as a movie and not a stunt reel.The focus is on the action and they turn out some head-snapping sequences a chase along a highway with an Army tank squashing cars like ants pummeling fights between Letty and female agent Riley (Gina Carano) and a jaw-dropping confrontation between Han Roman and one of Shaws nimble minions (the awesome Indonesian action star and judo champ Joe Taslim who was in The Raid Redemption one of the best martial-arts movies of the past decade). Then theres the finale involving a plane a fleet load of fast cars and what has to be the worlds longest runway.Its almost enough to distract from the fact that hardly anyone ever breaks a sweat let alone bones after being involved in multiple car wrecks falls from great heights onto speeding metal and glass and fights too numerous to mention.OK so Famp;F6 is a little light on the laws of physics and biology as well as intellectual stimulation. But thats all right. Actually the script may have been written in crayon after all but at least they used the big 64-count box. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Americas favorite car thieves join forces to take down an international criminal. Rated PG-13 (violence language skimpy outfits) BOTTOM LINE A comedown from the high of ""Fast Five"" but the physics-be-damned stuntwork and girl-on-girl beatdowns keep this series the guiltiest of pleasures. CAST Vin Diesel Paul Walker Michelle Rodriguez Gina Carano LENGTH 208 Few franchises hit their sweet spot like the ""Fast amp; Furious"" films. Ostensibly mere car flicks theyre fueled less by nitrous-injected V8s than by hip-hop street fashion video-game violence and most important a multiethnic cast. Unlike the Eurocentric Bond films the ""Fast"" films speak the lingua franca of a global youth culture that stretches from Los Angeles to Tokyo to Rio de Janeiro. All those hot spots so diverse yet somehow so alike have served as colorfully blurred backdrops in these movies rearview mirrors. The series also has ambition. In 2011 it aimed beyond its demographic with ""Fast Five"" a bona fide heist movie. Transforming its hot-rodding heroes into high-tech thieves ""Fast Five"" became the franchises top earner pulling in 625 million worldwide. It was also an artistic high point a tour-de-force of inspired stuntwork and creative property damage. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" continues the push into new genres though it inevitably feels like a comedown. Partly its an espionage thriller with ex-con Dominic Toretto (series veteran Vin Diesel) and his gear-head crew helping federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) chase international criminal Shaw (Luke Evans). Its also a soap opera Dominics dead girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is alive The opening minutes of exposition are furious but not fast enough. Once the gears mesh however things begin to hum. Theres hardware aplenty a cyborgian Formula One racer a tank an enormous airplane harpooned like Moby-Dick. Meanwhile its the tough soulful Rodriguez (""Lost"") who provides the premium unleaded. Only Rodriguez could butt heads with Gina Carano (the MMA fighter-actress of ""Haywire"" playing Hobbs partner) and then pull off a surprisingly tender scene with Diesel who murmurs suggestive metaphors like ""You lose traction and the back end kicks out."" Kudos also to new fight choreographer Olivier Schneider (""Rust amp; Bone"") for staging some white-knuckle beatdowns. ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" is a pass-the-baton movie Three-time director Justin Lin is reportedly bowing out and it looks like some members of the cast -- which includes Paul Walker Sung Kang Gal Gadot Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris -- will not return. A newcomer whose identity wont be spoiled here appears at the end. ""Fast amp; Furious 7"" is scheduled for July 2014. 234 MoviesNew Trailer Fast amp; Furious 6 PLOT Americas favorite car thieves join forces to take down an international criminal. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (violence language skimpy outfits) CAST Vin Diesel Paul Walker Michelle Rodriguez Gina Carano LENGTH 208 BOTTOM LINE A comedown from the high of ""Fast Five"" but the physics-be-damned stuntwork and girl-on-girl beatdowns keep this series the guiltiest of pleasures. 434 VideoNewsdays 5 cant-miss summer movies Director Justin Lins explosive idea The idea came screeching into director Justin Lins imagination in 2009 a fiery escape scene featuring a muscle car that crashes out of an airplane during takeoff. In production at the time on ""Fast amp; Furious"" -- the franchises fourth installment -- he commissioned digital ""previsualization"" artists to mock up a rendering even though the stunt did not fit the movie and was too expensive to film. Two years on the scene didnt make the cut for Lins 2011 sequel Fast Five"" either. ""The technology wasnt ready yet and I couldnt find the right story to tell it in"" the director explained. ""Everythings limitless. But you have to make sure the sequence fits organically into the journey.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" is without a doubt one of the top six ""Fast amp; Furious"" movies. Its a ripsnorting carmageddon that stylizes automotive annihilation the way John Woo used to choreograph death and destruction with guns and explosions. Its also an oddly split-personality movie that argues for the values of family faith and friendship arguing that often violence and peace are inextricably linked. Lots of bad people (and others not so deserving) are blown away but there are few gaudy displays of blood. Tellingly the most visible wound stains Vin Diesels behemoth chest like a red boutonniere when his heart is symbolically broken. Since 2001s ""The Fast and the Furious"" with federal agent Paul Walker chasing illegal racer Diesel then becoming part of his tight-knit clan the series has held an unusual place in the ranks of mindless action movies. While its mechanized violence is near-nihilistic it has a creed. The multicultural ""Furious"" gang who clasp hands over a family dinner bow heads and say grace at least once per film keep their morals always on display. Sure they engage in delirious violence and daredevil chases but knowing that life is short and unpredictable they always support and act honorably toward one another. Restoration always follows destruction. The new chapter begins with the crew scattered across the globe enjoying the bounty of the previous films big Brazilian drug-money heist. For Diesel and Walker that means modest Mediterranean domesticity with their lady loves. For incorrigible player Tyrese Gibson it means a private jet full of giggling bimbos. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges always up for a laugh scatters cash over the heads of delighted children like confetti. When government agent Dwayne Johnson arrives willing to exchange full U.S. pardons for their past crimes (imagine the speeding tickets) they agree to reassemble the team and help him nail the villain who stole a Russian nuclear zzz-zzz-zzz. Sorry there was a moment of exposition between the fireballs and I nodded off. The motivation for the films battles hardly matters. What counts is that they are extensive and bruising to flesh and sheet metal. MMA champ Gina Carano playing Johnsons partner adds a novel dash of convincing female butt-kickery to several scenes. The gear-grinding car-based mayhem ratchets up throughout the film to levels that make ""Transformers"" look like a Diane Keaton movie. Giles Keyte Associated Press - Ap Michelle Rodriguez in a scene from ""Fast amp; Furious 6."" If you think the apex of lunacy has been achieved when the ""Furious"" crew engages in a highway blitzkrieg with a superfast armored tank you underestimate the ambition of director Justin Lin. That is a mere hors doeuvre before the main course a melee involving a half-dozen supercharged sports cars harpoon launchers and a cargo plane the size of Cleveland. A character who appeared to be killed in an earlier film reappears here in league with the storys baddies and that is the storys true mainspring. Wooing that person back to the side of justice and honor is the prize that puts Diesel and his sidemen through their skull-cracking slugfests. Lurking under the brawls is a film about devotion and abandonment and chivalry where loyalty counts more than treasure. These are rather weighty concepts for a popcorn movie full of flying head-butts and car flips. Lin gets away with it because hes shamelessly entertaining. The ""Furious"" movies glorify destruction but they celebrate their characters bond above all. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Fast amp; Furious 6 Recommended Video Rated PG-13  130 minutes  2013 In this sixth installment of the action franchise the auto-racing roughnecks (Vin Diesel Paul Walker Michelle Rodriguez) team up with a federal agent (Dwayne Johnson) to hunt down an international terrorist. Director Justin Lin who took over the series with the third release The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift (2006) manages to imbue the material with Hawksian notions of masculinity group dynamics and moral authority even as he preserves the franchises multicultural milieu and gleefully exaggerated action sequences. Tying up some story lines while introducing others this has the feel of a B-movie series from the 40s like the Boston Blackie or Charlie Chan programmers.

Rating PG-13 for violence action mayhem language and sexuality. By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Thu May 23 2013 935 AM One thing you can say about ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" It makes you appreciate the talents of Dwayne Johnson. Its not that the former Rock seems as if hes heading for a Kennedy Center Honor any time soon. But next to the monosyllabic gravel-voiced and expressionless Vin Diesel Johnsons skills become even more evident. Hes simultaneously charming tough and funny and makes this labored sequel almost watchable. Note the ""almost."" Johnson is essentially going it alone it here. He gets no help from co-stars such as the charisma-impaired Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez whose once-promising career seems to have been reduced to playing variations on the same tough-girl role. The movie picks up with ""The Fast and Furious"" gang after their last outing. Toretto (Diesel) and his band of street-racing criminals have retired living on the riches from their last heist. However they fall back into action when special agent Hobbs (Johnson) calls the crew to track down an evil mastermind (Luke Evans) who works with Letty (Rodriguez) whom everyone thought was dead after their last caper. The plot which bobs around among London Spain and Los Angeles is more complicated than it needs to be. Its obvious that the whole enterprise exists merely for the action sequences which consist of (a) cars going fast and (b) cars crashing. Well to be fair there is a plane involved in the over-the-top finale but it doesnt add much to the adrenaline level. Its hard to get excited about any of the on-screen happenings because director Justin Lin cant seem to hit the right notes. Moments that are meant to be surprises arent including the reveal of a turncoat character. The people on screen dont act logically either. Once word arrives that the baddie is in Spain wouldnt it occur to someone that Torettos sister (Jordana Brewster) lives in the country and might be in danger? Other issues include comedic moments that thud and dramatic ones that will make you wince. ""Show me how you drive"" Toretto intones ""and Ill show you who you are."" Seriously? Perhaps the most annoying thing about the movie The final scene sets up yet another sequel. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Area theaters. ""Lets go for a little ride"" teases Vin Diesel as Dom Toretto at the start of ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" an amusingly mild suggestion thats also the only moment of understatement in two dizzyingly high-octane hours. In the first five minutes alone director Justin Lin speeds us from the Canary Islands to Moscow to London while also summarizing the five ""Famp;F"" films that came before. The recap is fun but hardly necessary. Every movie in this franchise is almost identical except for how (nearly) each one is better than the last. Thats true this time too. Somehow Lin just keeps topping himself with bigger fights badder villains bolder chases. And while Diesel was born to make these movies his pit crew has grown into a satisfyingly connected team. ""Family"" is the word Dom uses as often as possible. The communal spirit is what gives the ""Famp;F"" series its unexpected heart. This chapter is all about a family reunion. Doms long-ago love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was killed in the fourth film. But ""Fast Five"" revealed her to be alive and now we learn that shes working for another team led by the devilish Shaw (Luke Evans). He is on the verge of building some sort of technological warfare and Special Agent Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) needs Doms help to stop Shaw. Soon Dom his best friend Brian (Paul Walker) and their crew (including Ludacris Tyrese Gibson Gina Carano and Sung Kang) are in London staking out Shaw. Theyre ready to take him down but all Dom really wants is to see Letty again. Unfortunately she doesnt seem to have any idea who he is. Vin Diesel is back in gear as Dom in Fast amp; Furious 6. Its hard work making a formula feel fresh so most popcorn directors rely on a bloated budget and brainless action. But Lin understands this track inside and out backwards and forwards -- four directions out of countless others in which he spins us. Complaints? Well some members of the supporting cast are better than others. Rodriguez and Evans are particularly strong; Carano and Jordana Brewster as Doms sister are especially stiff. There are at least two more endings than we really need and Doms solemn sentimentality is as silly as it is endearing. The plot though serviceable and boosted by humor remains an excuse on which to hang breathtaking chases meticulously choreographed hand-to-hand combat and the occasional explosion. With all this outsized action the filmmakers deserve praise for rejecting 3-D so often used as a cynical bottom-line booster. But then Lin and Diesel who also produced arent just looking to grab our cash. They actually want us to have a great time. After all at this point were members of the ""Famp;F"" family too.

Now of course you cant kill it with a stick shift. Slideshow Furious but not so fast at 2-plus hours Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Fast amp; Furious 6 >> What changed? A slick but slight saga about nitro-charged street racers and the gearhead groupies who love them has gotten progressively bigger louder and more lavish each time out of the garage. Cops and criminals alike now flit around the world on private jets. And the ever-expanding crew around Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) battles foes worthy of James Bond. Throughout Fast amp; Furious 6 the good guys insist that the evil mastermind (Luke Evans) they are pursuing this time is on ""a whole different level."" So is the film saturated with more firepower more havoc more special effects more pedal-through-the-metal chase scenes and far more property destruction. The plot and dialogue are still stilted and stupid but that only proves that Justin Lin who has directed the last four F amp; Fs has his priorities straight. Diesels gang (Tyrese Gibson Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges Sung Kang and Gal Gadot) are living in far-flung splendor since the caper in Fast Five made them all multimillionaires. (The setup would be tedious were it not for the fact that you get to hear Ludacris speaking Spanish um fluently.) They are lured back into action by two badge holders (welcome addition Gina Carano and Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson who shines in this less demanding role - of course that could be the baby oil). The bait? Doms soul mate Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) may still be alive. This chick has more lives than a clowder of cats. And she may need them because shes pitted against former MMA champ Carano in the baddest fight scenes in the film. The three-knockdown rule is not in effect. In a twist straight out of ""The Bizarro Jerry"" episode of Seinfeld the outlaw outfit is made up of mirror images of Dom and Brians fellowship. After innumerable explosions and a stunning expo of high-performance vehicles the climactic showdown takes place on a runway so long its positively existential. You might want to spring for the jumbo bucket of popcorn because Fast amp; Furious 6 like its immediate predecessor breaks the two-hour barrier. That means appreciably more bang for your buck. And a shorter wait for Fast amp; Furious 7 now in preproduction. Fast amp; Furious 6  (Out of four stars) Directed by Justin Lin.

"Review Fast amp; Furious 6 is one sweet ride - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Fast amp; Furious 6 is one sweet ride Fast and Furious 6 Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews the new movie Fast amp; Furious 6 starring Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Gina Carano. Video by Jason H. Neubert Betsy Sharkey reviews the new movie Fast amp; Furious 6 starring Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Gina Carano. Video by Jason H. Neubert Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic As Socrates so sagely suggested when he stopped by the set of ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" -- ""Yo know thyself...""Dom and crew certainly took the words to heart. For all the excess in the latest installment of the adrenaline-injected street-racing action franchise its humble low-budget 2001 beginnings are still visible today in the rear-view mirror of Doms super souped-up 1969 Dodge Daytona Charger. Buildings topple bridges crumble and speed limits are shamelessly broken as ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" roars through the streets of London. But the ties that bind are stronger than ever.PHOTOS Scenes from ""Fast amp; Furious 6 True the movie doesnt know when or how to put the brakes on. It does however understand precisely what it is. No pretensions to greatness it demonstrates total dedication to ""badassness"" which I believe is the technical term.Even though Vin Diesels Dom insists ""I dont do cold"" the entire crew is in the British Isles having been hijacked by noble ideals a lost love and the hope of U.S. pardons for all their crimes and misdemeanors. Most recent was the 100 million they skimmed from a Brazilian drug lord in 2011s surprisingly satisfying ""Fast Five.""Though it hardly seems possible director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan have brought even greater intensity to ""6."" The filmmakers have been on board since 2006s ""Tokyo Drift"" which brought Dom -- and some sizzle in general -- back to the party after the disastrous ""2 Fast 2 Furious.""VIDEO Upcoming summer films In the new film the action sequences are the most ambitious yet. The fights are sophisticatedly choreographed to be more brutally bam-bam than ever. And the underlying theme of family and loyalty that remains key to the ""Furious"" appeal is so heavily underscored I believe every actor in the film gets to say ""family"" at least once.But what really sets ""Famp;F6"" apart is the blinding speed with which it shifts between over-the-top action that speedometer inching toward 800 mph at times and soap opera emotions that bring everything to a screeching halt. Its enough to give you whiplash ... in a good way.All the ""Fast"" friends are back. In case youre not up to speed the hard core include Doms best friend and ex-FBI-er Brian (Paul Walker) and Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) who is also Brians significant other and expecting their child. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) the computer whiz kid Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) ""Tokyo Drifts"" Han (Sung Kang) and ""Famp;F4s"" reformed bad girl Gisele (Gal Gadot) round out the crew.PHOTOS The cars of Fast amp; Furious 6But ""6s"" and Doms raison detre is Letty one of the franchise originals.Lettys return from the dead was the big tease at the end of ""Fast Five"" (this time the credits carry a hint about ""7""). Michelle Rodriguez makes her classic tough chick even tougher. She survived the end we thought we witnessed when her undercover cover in a drug cartel was blown a few ""Fasts"" back.Letty is alive but with no memory of Dom or anything else about her former life except how to drive. Her drag race through the streets of London with Dom -- their version of foreplay -- is reason enough to catch the flick at some point.For now though Lettys under the influence of newly notorious international villain Shaw (Luke Evans). Once a member of British SAS elite forces hes gone rogue.The actual ""reasons"" for Shaws villainy beyond selling a secret military thingy for major bucks is neither clear nor important. Federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) who spent ""Fast Five"" hunting Dom down now needs his help.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Why? Well because Shaw is a fast-car fanatic too. Its as good an excuse as any for Dom et al to pull off the most outrageous and implausible string of road racing maybe in the history of mankind. Shaws got his own crew of muscle men but Klaus (Kim Kold) is the only one who is much fun. He is literally bigger than Hobbs and their face-off I swear rattles the theater.In addition to all the dangerous driving that is the franchises signature nearly every major character spends time airborne over great expanses of nothingness with the ground or some landing spot far far below -- and often moving at high speed -- so a shout-out to the stunt team that earned its pay.Cinematographer Stephen F. Windon long a part of the ""Famp;F"" team does a spiffy job with all of it -- the high flying and the buildings planes and countless vehicles that implode and explode for the greater good.Still at times its hard not to wish for less. The fights play out in excruciating detail -- who said everyone could throw a punch? There is no end to the explosions. The love scenes are the one occasion restraint finally shows up. They are little more than moony glances mostly between Dom and Letty but honestly that was enough. As much of a kick as ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" can be in the pantheon of film even action films its no Shakespeare. But as Socrates also said ""It is what it is bro.""

But another cast members return is far more surprising (UNIVERSAL) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 23 2013 at 623 AM updated May 23 2013 at 625 AM comments At two hours and ten minutes the latest adventure of Dom Brian and the other assorted gearheads isnt very ""Fast."" But ""Furious""? It is that non-stop as cars catapult buildings explode and big guns go boom. And the fans cheer. They do too or at least did at the preview screening I went to and thats partly because the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise is as simply engineered and safely predictable as a slot-car oval. Start off with a high-octane prologue (which is often the last films epilogue). Assemble a racially diverse team of crooks-gone-good and cops-gone-bad. Give them something to steal. Then have them steal it -- interrupted by at least one gratuitous urban drag-race and decorated throughout with lots of skinny models curvy cars and the sort of absurd action that makes Bond and ""Mission Impossible"" look dully plausible. Its not exactly a complicated formula -- or particularly rewarding for anyone looking for identifiable characters or vaguely believable thrills. But ""Famp;F"" fans arent looking for that and ""Famp;F"" films dont confuse the issue by offering them. There is a slight surprise here -- or would be if all the trailers and posters hadnt already given it away -- in the return of Letty the character played by Michelle Rodriguez. Wait what? Wasnt she killed in ""Fast and Furious"" way back in 2009? It sure looked that way but apparently all that was nearly killed off then was Rodriguez career. So shes back even though we saw her funeral. ""You buried some body"" one of the bad guys explains. Oh well ok whatever. Lets ride. This time the gang is out to find Letty and stop some sort of international criminal whos out to steal a super-secret weapon. None of it is very well scripted or crisply acted. Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris do what they can with their comic-relief parts; Rodriguez plays the one emotion she can (sullen anger) with the one trick she has (take a beat look down or sideways then look back and slowly say the line). And theyre the highlights in the cast. Paul Walker still looks like a slightly surprised Abercrombie amp; Fitch model; Vin Diesel has all the expressiveness of a knuckle. The vein-popping Dwayne Johnson does the same shtick hes already done in at least three movies since January. As for the action sequences -- well they give ""over the top"" a new top to go over climaxing with an extended shoot-out involving a military transport several separate fistfights about half-a-dozen car crashes and assorted fireballs. Also definitely a new sort of stunt in which an actor literally launches himself into the air using his own thick skull as a battering ram to bring down his opponent. (Director Justin Lin likes this one so much he uses it twice.). What Lin is less good at -- or just not interested in -- is adhering to any kind of spatial logic or creating any sense of cause and effect. Where are these speeding cars in relation to each other? What are the drivers doing to crash other peoples cars or not crash their own? Theres no attention to that and the result is to effectively remove even these thinly drawn characters from the equation -- the cars may as well be riderless -- and from the drama. The whole thing becomes no different than a six-year-old knocking his toys together and making noises. Well theres one big difference. This playtime cost a reported 160 million -- and will probably make three or four times that easily. Which is why ""Famp;F 7"" is being planned its prologue already embedded in this films ending. Vroom vroom. Ratings note The film contains violence and sexual situations. Fast amp; Furious 6 (PG-13) Universal (130 min.) Directed by Justin Lin. With Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson. Now playing in New Jersey.",http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/05/fast_furious_6_review_auto_ero.html?utm_source=feedly,200,fastandfurious25,fastandfurious,nj

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Fast amp; Furious 6 is equal parts Oceans movie Road Runner cartoon and WWE SmackDown. In other words its more or less the same movie as its predecessor 2011s Fast Five--a surprise commercial and critical hit that didnt so much reinvigorate the Fast amp; Furious franchise as reinvent it. The series which began in 2001 with Rob Cohens throwback exploitation movie The Fast And The Furious has dropped any pretense of grit; like Fast Five Furious 6 is a big colorful B-movie romp where the laws of physics are routinely ignored. There are long mayhem-heavy setpieces involving armored race cars tanks harpoons and cargo planes. There are logic-defying leaps as well as leaps in logic. Its dumb fun--nothing more nothing less. In the world of the Fast amp; Furious franchise any crime can be committed using a car and every problem is solved by adding more cars. As the movie opens Fast Five antagonist Dwayne Johnson is hunting a team of automotive terrorists led by Luke Evans. Using the logic that one should fight fire with fire--or ""wolves with wolves"" as he puts it--he seeks out Vin Diesel who has retired from car-centric crime to lead a quiet life in the Canary Islands. Johnson piques Diesels interest by showing him a picture of one of Evans team members--Diesels ex-girlfriend played by Michelle Rodriguez who has long been presumed dead. After about 30 seconds of soul-searching Diesel calls his old gang back together; in exchange for full pardons and a fleet of sweet vintage cars theyll help Johnson catch Evans. The large supporting cast--a liability in most action franchises--is one of Furious 6s assets; the movie emphasizes team action over solo heroics and group banter over one-liners. The potentially dragging Rodriguez subplot is covered in a handful of scenes spread out across the movie and every member of the gang-- Paul Walker Tyrese Gibson Sung Kang Ludacris Gal Gadot--gets roughly equal screen time; as a result the movie often plays more like an ensemble piece than a Vin Diesel vehicle. Furious 6s climactic showdown isnt staged mano a mano but team vs. team each member doing their part. Its the action-movie equivalent of K-Pop.

"Fast amp; Furious 6 movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Fast amp; Furious 6 revels in childlike love of vehicular mayhem  1/2 ET to GO Fast Stars on Oklahoma Tornado In todays ET to GO The tone is subdued at the Fast amp; Furious 6 premiere as stars reflect on the deadly Oklahoma tornado. In todays ET to GO The tone is subdued at the Fast amp; Furious 6 premiere as stars reflect on the deadly Oklahoma tornado. Christopher BorrelliContact Reporter ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" -- which surely maxed out Universals tank-top budget for the year and sustains its joyful unpretentious ridiculousness so perfectly that I secretly hoped the ""6"" meant ""hours long"" -- ends with a disclaimer the sort of small-type legalese that typically arrives at the tail end of the closing credits. Except here its at the immediate end of the story like a Viagra warning/promise of a potential nine-hour uh adrenaline rush.To paraphrase On the way out of this theater should you get the urge to drive your tank into oncoming traffic across a towering bridge in Spain or feel the need to race a Dodge Charger down a runway and bring down a military transport with harpoons Universal Pictures will not be held responsible. Now heres the thing I am being only partly facetious.Indeed that disclaimer may even be wise. Because regardless of the unbelievability of what transpires the sixth installment of this fun car-thieves-with-honor series -- the fourth directed by the craftman-like Justin Lin quick becoming the John Ford of downshifting -- has a genuinely warm infectious sense of playfulness an anything-goes real-world tangibility that other grim-faced CGI-centric summer franchises long ago gave up on. Its as if its 1987 again and the filmmakers ran into Universal shouting the plot with the frenzied rush of a 6-year-old ""And then the tank crushes the cars and then it flips and then the military guy says we dont negotiate with terrorists and then The Rock says Wait yes we do then a big airplane explodes ..."" Without a doubt oodles of digital effects have been mixed in there somewhere -- when a character leaps across three lanes of traffic catches a racing compatriot and lands on a moving car the spell is broken momentarily. And the storytelling is never as inspired or clear-minded as the films action-movie spirit. But as a welcome reminder of how to keep a silly franchise fresh and lighthearted -- without succumbing to the heavy grit and intensity that Hollywood too often confuses with relevance -- its a surprising unlikely delight.Even the villain -- an international man of mystery (played by Luke Evans) with a pencil-thin silent-movie mustache and a powerful weapon component that can bring down a nation so were told -- seems happily shocked. How remarkable that in a decade or so a team of streetwise car thieves led by Vin Diesels Dom has gone from stealing DVD players in East LA to well wrestling with terrorists on the tarmac of a European runway the fate of the world in the balance In fact to be more specific Since the first film Diesels road racers have become expert drivers crime fighters and counter-terrorism experts adept at aerodynamics military acumen and computer science. Or as Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges character explains after a few keystrokes on some random laptop ""I just jammed every signal up and down the spectrum""Of course you did. In the span of six pictures with increasing fluidity members of the team -- they dont really have a name which is a branding blind spot -- have become sophisticated citizens of the world a kind of Pep Boys-Julian Assange collective their (victimless) robberies and flouting of U.S. traffic laws forcing them into exile. The opening of the new film finds us in the Canary Islands where Dom -- and now yearning for home. In the previous installment he stole 100 million in Brazilian drug money -- the spectacularly destructive getaway remains the series high point -- but now he wants to turn in that bling for an old-fashioned barbecue in his Los Angeles neighborhood.Enter federal agent Hobbs (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who wanted Dom and his multi-ethnic band of thieves -- including the less-excitingly named Brian played by Paul Walker a less exciting discount-Paul Newman -- taken down in ""Fast Five."" Now he sees a need for Dom and his racers Theres that British terrorist and he improbably leads his own racers so why turn to the CIA or MI5 when you can ask those goofballs who know how to drive really fast? ""You need wolves to catch wolves"" Hobbs explains.If they succeed Full exoneration and a return to home -- no more lazy Sundays with nude models in exile.Actually if ""Fast 6"" -- as the title card at the opening refers to it -- shows any new ambitions its by enthusiastically embracing its inner-Telemundo its heated knotty ""Game of Thrones"" melodrama Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) -- whom everyone thought was blown up in the fourth film a victim of the gangs attempt to bring down a Mexican cartel -- is alive and working for the British terrorist. And she has amnesia Similarly Han (Sung Kang) who supposedly died in the third film remains in the team and has fallen in love with another racer Gisele (Gal Gadot) a former Mossad agent who as far as I could tell has no big secrets.Though I suppose the film is also at its creakiest in these moments -- theres a longish middle section where in which you wonder where Lin left all the gas pedals -- that human stuff rarely feels dull. Even bits of class resentment come and go with breeziness; a bit featuring Johnson/the Rock Ludacris and a sniffy Brit (he mistakes them for ""kitchen help"") is straight out of a Cheech and Chong movie but I liked Cheech and Chong movies. So maybe none of this is convincing. But the cast seems to sincerely like each one another and the coziness goes a long way until the next action scene. Which are worth the wait of course Lin who knows how to stage a chase as well as the next Bond director sprinkles them around generously topping a tank fantasy with an airplane heist and punctuating a ""Road Warrior""-like pursuit through London with a car flipping end over end through a glass office complex. By this point in the series it goes without saying that the action is spectacular but less obviously perhaps is that Lin understands the visceral possibilities of space -- the closeness of tires the wedge of room that allows a car to escape a tight bind. Hes has said in interviews that before he shoots such sequences he stages every chase with toy cars and imagines the possibilities. And indeed its a testament to this freewheeling big-budget plaything that his 6-year-old self is still very much evident.And how that 6-year-old could work in that harpoon. cborrellitribune.comFast amp; Furious 6 -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action and mayhem throughout some sexuality and language)Running time 210Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Unrest Conflicts and War Theft Dwayne Johnson Sung Kang Vin Diesel Fast amp; Furious 6 premiere Vin Diesel et al. cruise into L.A.

Demolition abounds. When the vehicular mayhem subsides brawling and gunshots take over -- aboard a plane in a metro station around buildings and open lots. This sixth installment (  out of four; rated PG-13; opening Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwide) is all commotion clashes and crashes all the timeWhen the familiar squadron of outlaw racers needs to catch its breath out pops a cliched phrase a puerile comment or maybe just an enthusiastic ""Yeah""Heres a movie that could easily have been dialogue-free. And probably would have been better for it. But the volume is a key element especially for those who find the sound of revved-up engines evocative.STORY Famp;F 6 revs up for Memorial Day race at theatersGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYPlotwise the previous Fast and Furious in Brazil was superior. This ultra-formulaic entry definitely has a few exciting stunts -- a car hurtling out of a flaming airplane two bodies flying through the air and landing safely in a clutch (of the hug variety not a car component). But the story is standard-issue. The racing crew of international criminals globe-trots as in past films though much of the action takes place in London. Amazingly the British capitals busy streets are wide open for racing -- except for the occasional double-decker bus that nearly gets toppled.Brawny U.S. Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is seeking the help of the car-crazy crew to take down the evil Shaw (Luke Evans) a mercenary terrorist/crime lord who has gotten his hands on top-secret military equipment. In exchange they will be given amnesty for previous crimes. And the world will avoid annihilation. Its a pretty sweet deal.But their old compatriot Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) thought dead has resurfaced as one of of Shaws henchmen. The ever-loyal lug nut Dom (Vin Diesel) insists she be rescued. Dom loves Letty. We know this because he drag-races with her and then proclaims throatily ""Show me how you drive and Ill show you who you are.""In a particularly inane story arc Brian (Paul Walker) spends 24 hours in a California prison to extract information from a prisoner. Inexplicably he gets sprung just in time to join his pals back in Europe for the climactic race against the villainous Shaw.The quips generally fall flat and Diesels delivery is the worst.

But really good big dumb action movies -- think Predator Speed and 2013-06-08Universal Pictures Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr DOM-INANT SPECIES Vin Diesel is back as Dominic Toretto in the heart-punding adrenaline-pumping sixth edition of the Fast amp; Furious franchise. (Universal) B+ Fast amp; Furious 6 Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Jordana Brewster Vin Diesel Dwayne Johnson Michelle Rodriguez Paul Walker; Director Justin Lin; Release Date Wide 05/24/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 130; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Pictures Posted June 8 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Big dumb action movies are a dime a dozen each summer. But really good big dumb action movies -- think Predator Speed and Independence Day -- are rare indeed. So when one of them comes off the Hollywood assembly line and zaps your brains less discerning pleasure centers attention must be paid. Which brings us to Fast amp; Furious 6 -- a borderline ridiculous over-the-top demolition derby that also happens to be a perfectly constructed low-IQ blast. I dont mean to sound dismissive of Justin Lins latest entry in the wildly successful Famp;F franchise. It takes a certain kind of logistical genius to engineer a movie this giddily entertaining especially six films in. Back in 2001 when Vin Diesels chrome-domed ringleader Dom Toretto and Paul Walkers ex-cop Brian OConner first got behind the wheel no one wouldve guessed that wed still be invested in a bunch of thrill-seeking grease monkeys more than a decade later. But here we are happily strapping in for another chapter. The film kicks off with a tire-screeching chase in the Canary Islands (where Brian and Jordana Brewsters Mia are new parents) before hopscotching to London and Moscow after the gang is tasked by Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) with nabbing a bad guy named Shaw (Luke Evans) in exchange for pardons. Oh and one other thing Theyll also be reunited with the presumed-dead Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) whos risen from the grave (just go with it) and now works for Shaw. Ludacris provides the tech support Tyrese Gibson the one-liners Sung Kang and Gal Gadot the sexual tension and Gina Carano the beatdowns. But lets be clear This is the aptly named Diesels vehicle all the way. With his croaky foghorn voice that seems to operate on a frequency all its own hes the lunkhead heart of the film -- especially during its bonkers cargo-plane climax. Trust me its one of the biggest dumbest and most electrifying action sequences in ages. Check your brain at the door and fasten your seat belt.

That one ran out of gas midway through the second installment and expired after Burt Reynolds and Sally Fields refused to return for the third. In its third outing ""Fast and Furious"" replaced its entire original cast with cheaper personnel -- but all of them eventually returned and are now reassembled with additional recruits from over the years. Justin Lin who helmed that third one ""Tokyo Drift"" and every one since now perfectly understands what audiences want eye-popping stunts involving a wide variety of vehicles assorted martial arts stuff blowing up and just a soupcon of plot comedy bromance and romance. For my money ""Furious 6 is more fun than ""Skyfall and a lot more fun than the deadly dull ""Star Trek Into Darkness both of which ask you to take their silly plots way too seriously. Theres no such danger in ""Fast and Furious which plays fast and loose with credibility and the laws of physics allowing souped-up cars to tumble end over end and characters to leap across a chasm between two lanes of an elevated highway from which a tank is dangling precariously. I especially enjoyed a lengthy set-piece where the crew is pursuing an enormous cargo plane which they try to prevent from taking off by lashing their cars to the underbelly. This takes place on the runway of a Spanish NATO base that by my rough calculations is something like 30 miles long. And yes there is a story that surfaces now and then over two quickly moving hours. Dwayne Johnsons federal agent recruits the crew of badass drivers to stop a generic British bad guy (Luke Evans) with his own crew from stealing a component for a dirty bomb he plans to sell to terrorists. Mere money being an insufficient inducement for drivers who scored millions at the end of ""Fast 5 Johnson offers amnesty so the fugitives from justice can return to the United States. And as an added inducement for Vin Diesels crew leader Johnson reveals that Diesels former girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) -- presumed dead at the end of 2009s ""Fast and Furious -- is alive conveniently suffering from amnesia and currently the squeeze and chief lieutenant to the aforementioned British bad guy. Got that? The cast of ""Furious 6 -- including co-leader Paul Walker Tyrese Gibson Ludacris and Jordana Brewster as well as series newcomer Gina Carino -- seem to be having a grand old time chasing bad guys goofing on each other and busting heads on three continents. If youre willing to check your brains at the popcorn stand I think you probably will enjoy yourself too. And you wont even have to wear those stupid 3-D glasses.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Fast and Furious 6 Faster Crazycars Thrill Thrill The huge racing machines we love to watch -- and their cars -- are back for more crashes clashes and crushes in the early summers biggest adrenaline rush By Richard Corliss May 20 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Universal Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Vin Diesel could be his own oversize action toy -- slablike solid and smooth stripped of all cranial facial or underarm hair -- or the mammoth statue of a god erected by primitive tribes. Dwayne Johnson is that deity but even more imposing and a marvel when he springs into liquid motion. Called the Samoan Thor he is the irresistible force to Diesels immovable object; and when they fight a gang of enemies or each other the heavens seem ready to explode with their practiced wrath. Johnson hitched a ride on the Fast amp; Furious franchise two years ago in Fast Five as DEA Officer Luke Hobbs determined to bring to justice Diesels multiracial girls-allowed gang of carnappers. This time he has promised them all full pardons if they bring down a cyberterrorist named Shaw (Luke Evans) who has acquired a microchip that will shut down all U.S. military computers for 24 hours. Big deal you say -- the software that should pay veterans benefits has been inoperable for years. Still Dominic Toretto (Diesel) agrees to the deal. His mates arent so sure. ""So"" says Han Seoul-oh (Sung Kang) ""now we work for the Hulk?"" No the Rock. (READ Corlisss review of Fast Five) Are Toretto and Hobbs human? Not really by the standards of traditional movies which demand behavioral nuance and emotional compromise and men fretting. Are the guys superhuman? Sure; the Famp;F films are big-screen comic books without the Marvel mythology. But above all Dom and Hobs are posthuman. Fast Five heralded the New Hollywoods exaltation of sensational action over subtle character. Fast and Furious 6 revs everything up purifies and improves it. The fourth Famp;F movie to be directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan Furious 6 is even cooler and more aerodynamically delirious than its predecessor if such a thing is even theoretically possible. Five movies after The Fast and the Furious the 2001 original (which was a loose remake of a 1955 film produced by Roger Corman) whats left to do with cars? Well this from Fast Five Dom drove a 66 Corvette Grand Sport sideways out of a speeding freight car to race the train toward an imminent cliff. Then Doms blond buddy Brian (Paul Walker) leaped off the train and into the car milliseconds before it plummeted off the cliff and into a river far below. The bonding of the two autoholics was impressive but not nearly so much as the teamwork of the Fast Five stunt team. In a movie era when dramatic ingenuity is close to evaporating the complex split-second choreography of men and cars is an expression of medium-to-high film art. (READ Why Fast Five was on TIMEs 2011 list of Best Movies) Doms own team which now numbers an appropriate six comprises Brian Hobbs Han Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) Tej Parker (Chris Ludacris Bridges) and Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot). Rich and retired after the Rio heist in Fast Five they either are living it up -- Roman remote-activates an ATM that spews bills for the poorer locals to gather up -- or have settled down. Brian lives with Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) Dom with Hobbs Rio colleague Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky). Fatherhood has mellowed the outlaws. ""Our old life is done"" Dom tells Brian two seconds before a photo that Hobbs sends Dom propels all of them back into the only part of their lives the audience cares about. The photo is of Doms long-lost love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) presumed dead in a car crash in the fourth Famp;F. Brian should know ""I buried her"" he says. But no. Letty is alive and working for Shaw. After the Fast Five train planes and automobiles for Furious 6. And a tank that busts out of a truck. And some trains the London underground where Letty and Shaws badass girl Riley (mixed martial arts champ Gina Carano) engage in the punishing balletry of hand-to-fist and foot-to-groin combat. But still plenty of cars. The opening scene captures from fender-level view or in graceful helicopter shots a sports car navigating the corniches on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. In Moscow a police car in pursuit of bad guys somehow lands upside down in the third-floor window of an office building. And when Shaw rouses his own crew of Team Dom lookalikes (""Its like were huntin our evil twins"" Tej observes) plus Lettty the movies centerpiece -- a car chase through a city -- gets apocalyptic. (READ Corlisss review of the car-crazy Gone in 60 Seconds) Not content to monitor the NASCAR-worthy collisions from a helicopter the camera heads into the traffic swerving between onrushing cars like some speed-demon oldster whos confused Palm Beach with Daytona Beach. Pursuing Aristotles dictum that action is character this great sequence narrows the focus to Doms attempt to disable Lettys car without hurting her. His feelings are still devotional hers apparently homicidal since the crack on her head in that crash two movies back left her with a case of amnesia. The punch line when the two cars screech to a stop Letty pulls a gun and shoots Dom in the shoulder -- which given his massive beefcake is like aiming a pea shooter at a Spanish fighting bull. Yet he still wants to protect her. ""You dont turn your back on family"" he says ""even when they do."" Though hes committed to Elena at least for a couple of films Dom must be drawn back to Letty in part because Diesel and Rodriguez are a perfect iconographic match similar skin tone handsome-brute features and professional swagger. (For him saving her is almost an act of narcissism.) They bond the only way they know in an outlaw race around London that turns the busy West End into Le Mans. As the contest commences Dom looks at her and utters the magic mantra ""Ride or die"" -- and Letty snaps out of her amnesia. Suddenly she remembers. Or maybe she just saw the music video. (READ Summer Movie Preview 2013) Family being such a clangorous motif here youd think that Dom and Brian might be concerned for the women and children theyve left back home. Mia and Elena will show up for the climax along a Tenerife highway where Shaw has unveiled his 70-ton tank and another cool toy a ""flip car"" named for the carnage it inflicts on vehicles in its way. Among the amazements in this sequence a tripwire that sends the tank into a somersault and Dom and Lettys Cirque du Soleil double flying act across the highway that has them land safely on a passing car hood as if its an air cushion -- because that wouldnt kill them; only a 200-lb. deer dies like that. ""So whats our next adventure?"" somebody asks. You were thinking this must be the end; nothing can top it. Instead everyone drives maniacally down an airport runway to hitch a ride on a gigantic military transport. (""Thats not a plane its a planet."") In the cargo hold each of the good guys -- Dom Brian Hobbs Letty and the rest -- picks a fight with his or her evil twin in a battle that fuses into some abstract postnarrative rugby scrum. The plane the cars the people have all become machines whose only function is to keep the movie speeding and the audience supremely entertained. (READ  Top 15 Greatest Car Chases of All Time) As with Fast Five the new movie ends with a preview of its next episodes villain. Ill just hint that its a bald guy with a Limey accent phoning Dom to say ""You dont know me but youre about to."" Boom If youre like me youll be wanting Famp;F 7 (which will be directed by Saw auteur James Wan) to premiere not on July 11 2014 but right now this second. This adrenaline-stoking series is addictive for its chases crashes crushes -- and for its poetic limning of the closest camaraderie many men can ever know with their cars. Owning one somebody says is like a marriage. ""Yeah"" one of the guys replies ""but when you break up they dont take half your shit.""

Now most of the stunts are digital and the pleasures are video-game-stupid Cars pounce like panthers over demolished bridges; they get flattened by a tank; they dangle like tin cans off a just-married bumper (if that bumper were a Russian cargo plane). None of it makes any sense except within the high-octane logic of blowing stuff up onscreen. And in case youre wondering sometimes that can be entertainment enough Slack-jawed euphoria shoots like nitro through the film. (Please be careful in the parking lot afterward.)Is it beside the point to mention there are actual human beings in here as well? Scratch that Theyre sort of human but buffed to a faintly unrealistic sheen. Dwayne Johnson lugs around that ridiculous upper torso as an international supercop while the agile Gina Carano trades roundhouse kicks with perpetual sneerer Michelle Rodriguez her character revived from the dead as an amnesiac. (Dont worry; no ones keeping tabs in the audience.) Muscle-teed Vin Diesel remains the criminal gearshifter at the heart of the mayhem and even though hes unfairly saddled with a Heat-like verbal showdown about competing ""codes"" with Furious 6s terrorist villain (Luke Evans) his grumbly stoicism still gets good mileage. Dont think too hard about it.Follow Joshua Rothkopf on Twitter joshrothkopf By Joshua Rothkopf Posted Tuesday May 21 2013 Details Release details Rated PG-13 Release date Friday May 24 2013 Duration 130 mins Cast and crew Director Justin Lin Cast Vin DieselPaul WalkerDwayne JohnsonMichelle Gomez Users say LiveReviews|01 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/fast-furious-6-movie-review,200,fastandfurious32,fastandfurious,timeout

Countless action directors aspire to the big dumb fun that these last few franchise entries have provided but whereas most of them only get ""dumb"" and maybe ""big"" right director Justin Lin and his crew deliver fun fun fun. (And nobody takes anybodys T-Bird away.) Also read The Hangover Part III Review Thank God for Peculiar Perverse - and Outrageously Funny - Galifianakis ""Furious 6"" (as the film is called in the opening credits) opens with criminal and street racer Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) his girlfriend Elena (Elsa Pataky) Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Mias husband (and Doms former nemesis turned best bro) Brian OConner (Paul Walker) living the good life in the Canary Islands enjoying the spoils of the big Brazilian bank job from ""Fast Five"" and avoiding extradition. Thankfully their bliss comes to an end when federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up with an offer that Dom and Brian cant refuse; Hobbs needs their help in taking down international no-goodnik Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and the fact that one of Shaws henchmen appears to be Doms girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) - thought to have been killed two movies ago in ""Fast amp; Furious"" - compels the hot-rodders out of retirement to rescue her. Also read Behind the Candelabra Review Sex Lies amp; the Closet Nabbing Shaw means putting the band back together so Tej (Ludacris) Han (Sung Kang) Gisele (Gal Gadot) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) are all called in from their respective exiles to pitch in. Shaw has his own Benetton-ad-ready group of multi-ethnic henchmen while Hobbs has his own backup the hard-kicking Riley (Gina Carano of ""Haywire""). Theres a lot of running around regarding the McGuffin device that Shaw wants to steal so he can do very bad things but thats not what ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" is really about; its really about driving really fast through Picadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square and zipping along Spanish expressways while being shot at by a tank. And Lin and his team do an extraordinary job of staging the ever-escalating action sequences up to a jaw-on-the-floor finale involving various four-wheel vehicles in and around a cargo plane thats trying to take off. Not that all of the films thrills are tied in to combustible engines. Getting to see Carano and Rodriguez (two of the screens reigning bad-asses of any gender) go mano-a-mano twice counts as some kind of action movie landmark and we also get Joe Taslim of the exhilarating ""The Raid Redemption"" using his not-inconsiderable martial arts skills as one of Shaws men. (The non-action casting is fairly creative as well with Thure Lindhart an Independent Spirit Award nominee for last years powerful ""Keep the Lights On"" popping up in a supporting role.) When the craziness slows down and people actually talk the theme of family is constantly underlined to the extent that my seatmate suggested a drinking game for every time the word ""family"" is mentioned. Nonetheless while Diesel and Walker have a fairly limited skill set as actors they are put to good use here and six movies in theyve definitely established themselves and their co-stars as a cohesive unit. The crazy gender politics of the ""Fast and Furious"" movies remain on display and not just through the macho posturing and the bikini-clad car models writhing in slow motion. Every joke insult or threat in the movie seems to revolve around the feminization if not outright emasculation of men. Its the sort of overcompensating weve come to expect from a series that critic Jennifer Smith once called ""tender and homoerotic"" and that spawned the ""SNL"" parody ""The Fast and the Bi-Curious."" ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" serves up a big plate of entertainment. Its makers never pretend its a steak but theyre happy to offer up a big fat juicy hamburger with extra cheese.

Every problem these lugnuts face can be solved by doing the one thing these lugnuts love most driving really fast. Its like if you could deal with your taxes by hunkering down with a season of Justified. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Over the course of six films now these heroic outlaws have raced their Hot Wheels for justice for wealth for respect to clear their names to save the world from terrorists. The cast--a sort of super-Model U.N. the hotness global rather than localized--and their cars have raced through L.A. Rio and Tokyo against tankers and trains and candy-colored drift-cars so shiny and darling they might have been confected by Pixar. They even tore through single-lane mine shafts beneath the U.S./Mexican border without dirtying up their rides but that was dumb so lets forget it.The latest installment is a movie much more entertaining than the churlish might expect for one with ""fast"" or ""furious"" or ""six"" in the title. Director Justin Lin (who helmed the films from the third on) offers his most resplendent parade of chases and crashes yet all shot and cut in that radical new style the one where audiences can apprehend in one viewing just what is supposed to be going on. In the most exciting sequence theres a tank to be brought down a hilariously high and long bridge and much winning business with a harpoon. (A crushed car gets dragged a gag as satisfying as the bank vault that skidded along downtown Rio in Fast 5.)The ridiculousness of the bridge chase is topped by the climax when an assortment of the franchises action figures--some returning some teaming up some turning like pro-wrestling heels against their own established teams--must stop a cargo plane from taking off. Everybody races at what seems to be impossible speeds for what seems to be at least 15 minutes straight on down what certainly is the worlds longest runway.Lins firs tFast/Furious films shared the troubles afflicting too many of this ages kabooming blockbusters a feeling of video-game inconsequence right down to route maps and a scene of Paul Walkers FBI agent selecting his car off the dozens arrayed on video monitors. (He picked three and mined two for parts.) While certainly tricked-out with digital effects work part 6 and its direct predecessor feel analog by comparison. Instead of on a Playstation the chases seem to take place on the floor and in the mind of a 10-year-old. Theres nothing to laud here in terms of storytelling and the dialogue is all quips and exposition but Lin aces something rare the spirit of freewheeling play.Another improvement in version 6.0 Everyone involved at last seems to understand that the mode here is comic. Previous entries suffered from self-important glumness that gummed up the fun whenever the cars werent racing. The scenes of Toretto (Vin Diesel) coping with the death of his true love Lettie (Michelle Rodriguez) in Fast and Furious the fourth film werent just inert--they were the equivalent of that 10-year-olds Hot Wheels getting stuck in the sandbox. Tyrese is given more screentime and one-liners than hes had since 2 Fast 2 Furious. (His new shtick baller millionaire too cheap to stick a dollar in a vending machine.) Warheaded leads Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson leaven their hulking by making it clear their characters relish the mayhem. And the non-vehicular action is the strongest in the series especially an extended womano a womano between Gina Carano and Rodriguez and one sublimely dumb bit of tag-team ass-kicking from Diesel and Johnson.So its fun. The biggest surprise is that Letties return to the series inspires Lin to a character-drama breakthrough. (Uh spoilers ahead I guess?) A good outlaw racer turned evil thanks to a priceless case of amnesia Lettie here is re-courted by Toretto the only way this series knows how a spirited street race. But this isnt just another flirty shift-and-grind. As Toretto explains hes reminding Lettie of how she raced of who she really is. Here at last is the Proustian car chase the gearbox the talismanic madeleine the racers in search of lost time. For the adults who relish Lins capital nonsense the films themselves might have a similar power This is what it used to feel like to play.Follow VoiceFilmClub 1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

It opens with brawny diplomatic security service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) handing Vin Diesels retired con Dom Toretto a dossier. The folder relates to a ruthlessly efficient gang of military equipment hijackers fronted by an ex-SAS operative-turned-bad-ass-felon (Luke Evans) and also to Doms former lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) now presumed dead. Before long were on the streets of a grimy dimly lit London for another fusillade of mind-numbing automobile bedlam all of it staged with the usual risible disregard for any of the laws of physics. With its puerile dialogue daft performances flat comic repartee and ear-rupturingly loud sound levels the experience of watching Fast amp; Furious 6 is like listening to death metal pour out of 500-watt speakers while being strapped to a pneumatic drill. Apart from Diesels likeably mild-mannered persona theres little here that we havent seen before.

This isnt the Great Gatsby and it isnt intended as a piece of fine art. You need to think of films like a meal. This isnt cordon bleu or nouvelle cuisine its a burger plain and simple and a massive burger at that. As far as burgers go this is actually a very good one. It is filling and hits the spot. If you like your films loud and full of action then this is for you. It isnt high art but take it at face value and it is good fun. Also stay at the end for the Tokyo car chase for an interesting twist to set up Fast 7. The screening was fuller than any I have seen for a long time and on a Saturday afternoon as well.

Daily Edition Login to download Fast amp; Furious 6 Film Review 300 PM PDT 5/13/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Universals biggest franchise just keeps on rolling. TWITTER Vin Diesel Dwayne Johnson and Paul Walker return for the sixth installment in the Universals action franchise which is already prepping a seventh film slated for next summer. ""So this is worth billions huh?"" queries Vin Diesels big-muscled hotshot driver to Dwayne Johnsons even bigger-muscled federal agent as he delivers the object theyve spent the bulk of Fast amp; Furious 6 looking for. ""Name your price"" Johnson replies to conclude what can only have been an in-joke by those responsible for a series that through five films has grossed 1.5 billion and still looks to be gaining speed globally. This new entry will only add mightily to the good fortunes of Universals biggest franchise; no matter how silly and outlandish the action gets -- and it does become ridiculous -- it also delivers the goods its audience expects with the added bonus of the return of Michelle Rodriguez. In the spirit of striking while the irons hot its no surprise that Fast amp; Furious 7 is already in pre-production with an announced released date of next July. Youve got to feel for screenwriter Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin who have been on board for the last four installments and each time are faced with the challenge of coming up with ever-bigger action set pieces comparable to those in Bond films and comic book spectaculars but with the proviso that they must always feature cars. The vehicular cast is this time joined by an enormous army tank and a jet airplane that keeps charging down a runway for takeoff for what seems like seven or eight minutes but no matter; if it stays on the ground the Famp;F crew can deal with it. VIDEO Fast amp; Furious 6 Reveals Action-Filled Extended Look The original characters in the 12-year-old franchise know about cars and not a whole lot else although based on their exploits in Rio two years ago they and their newly acquired cohorts have become incredibly rich able to live lives of leisure almost anywhere they wish around the world except the States which would like to see them in the slammer. Aside from money what this band of SoCal misfits can claim (and does repeatedly) is an ad hoc sense of family and the easy familiarity among the cast members and between actors and audience plays an important part in the series success. Scruffily attractive at first and eventually more multi-cultural than Benetton the clan immediately started breaking up -- Diesel didnt even return for 2 Fast 2 Furious and it wouldnt have been a big surprise to see the franchise just fold up after that series-worst entry. But the four original main leads -- Diesel Paul Walker Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster -- are finally all back for this one along with numerous other latecomers most notably Johnson their lawman adversary in Rio who this time comes to them with a deal. It seems a generic British mercenary terrorist named Shaw (Luke Evans) is one component away from completing a weapons arsenal that will threaten the world as we know it. So whos at the top of the list among all international crime-fighters to bust this guy? No contest. Snatching up Diesels Dom from his love nest in the Canary Islands and Walkers Brian from the domesticity of fatherhood with Brewsters Mia whos sidelined most of the time here with a baby Johnsons blunt-spoken Luke Hobbs offers the team a deal they cant refuse Nail Shaw and theyre all pardoned. STORY Fast amp; Furious 6 Justin Lin and His Cast Roar Into London for World Premiere Like many villains these days Shaws skill-set embraces two realms high-tech weaponry and martial arts. Far more importantly however hes a great driver escaping from his first encounter with the Americans in a military-style Formula 1 race car through the streets of London. To be sure more high-speed chases follow but theyre generally not top-grade; theyre cut too fast the camera set-ups dont provide a sense of maximum speed the angles dont always mesh well and the frequent nocturnal settings obscure the view. By contrast some of the fighting and martial arts stuff featuring Diesel Johnson Shea Whigham as Shaws strongman and series newcomer Gina Carano (Haywire) arent bad. Plot-wise the main point of interest is how Rodriguezs Letty once thought dead is worked back into the action. With no memory of her old friends or happened to her she initially turns up as part of Shaws evil team and even shoots Dom who endeavors to reawaken her to her past. This plot thread comes off well enough and sets the character up for future adventures along with the high-living Roman (Tyrese Gibson) Han (Sung Kang) Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Gisele (Gal Gadot). One new element in the series is its sense of high-living. These were low-end working-class characters to begin with but now with 100 million socked away theyve entered the world of expensive electronics private jets and fancy international destinations. The location of a quick street race epilogue is Tokyo wherein the identity is revealed of the British action icon who will clearly be joining the series for the next installment.

Mounted on an even larger scale than 2011s epic (and massively profitable) ""Fast Five"" this series swan song for helmer Justin Lin (on board since 2006s ""Tokyo Drift"") ups its own ante on balletic vehicular mayhem and international intrigue while mending some loose narrative ends and unfurling others. Faithful fans and passersby alike should be more than pleased by this superior piece of classical action craftsmanship which looks to meet or exceed its predecessors nitrous-boosted 626 million global take.SEE MORE Billion Dollar Filmmaker Justin Lin Arriving three months after the misbegotten ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" (or merely ""Furious 6"" as its official title card reads) offers an object lesson in how to keep a leggy saga alive and relevant without losing sight of the elemental strengths that made it popular in the first place. Though high-octane stunts have always been the primary selling point here Lin and veteran ""Fast"" screenwriter Chris Morgan have labored to add depth dimensionality and inner conflict to the now-sprawling cast of recurring characters -- so much so that at times ""Furious 6"" plays like a glossy gearhead melodrama. <a href=""http//polldaddy.com/poll/7101175"">Take Our Poll</a> The actors have grown nicely into their roles over the years evolving into one of the most diverse ensembles ever assembled for this kind of production. Women and men kick ass in equal measure in the ""Fast"" movies and the good guys/girls come in all shapes sizes and colors. Theres even a romance between a Korean (Sung Kangs Han) and an Israeli (Gal Gadots ex-Mossad agent Gisele) -- which by major studio standards is more exotic than Captain Kirk bedding down with an alien. No matter who you are theres someone here to identify with. ""Furious 6"" opens amid the scenic vistas of Spains Canary Islands where FBI agent-turned-fugitive Brian OConner (Paul Walker) and his former nemesis-turned-BFF Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) were seen hanging up their car keys at the end of ""Fast Five"" along with Doms pregnant sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) aka the future Mrs. OConner and their respective shares of 100 million in pilfered Brazilian drug money. SEE ALSO Justin Lin Furious Filmmaker Finds Better Luck Tomorrow Following a brief prologue in which Mia gives birth the pic hopscotches to Moscow where federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson reprising his ""Fast Five"" character) surveys the damage from a violent attack on a Russian military convoy. The culprit Hobbs explains to his new partner (""Haywire"" star and real-life MMA champion Gina Carano) is Owen Shaw (the snarling Luke Evans) an international man of mystery seeking to build a dirty bomb capable of knocking out an entire countrys military defense systems. Shaw doesnt intend to use the bomb himself for which he needs only one more component part but rather to sell it to the highest bidder. In a departure from the latest vogue in movie villains this one isnt an ideological bin Laden-esque terrorist but rather a stone-cold capitalist -- though admittedly it can be hard to tell the difference these days. Shaw runs with his own gang of grease-monkey mischief makers who as one character deftly observes suggest the evil twins of Torettos crew (right down to a bald Cockney Diesel doppelganger). He also tools about in a custom-built ""flip"" car (so named for the damage it inflicts on anything it comes into contact with) that resembles the love child of a Dune Buggy and a Formula One car. Resolving that ""you need wolves to catch wolves"" Hobbs hightails it to the Canaries to enlist Doms help -- a negotiation expedited by Hobbs revelation that one of Shaws associates is a dead ringer for Doms erstwhile soulmate Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who appeared to meet up with the wrong end of a gun in 2009s ""Fast and Furious."" Rodriguezs return to the franchise teased at the end of ""Fast Five"" isnt the first time these movies have brought a beloved character back from the grave having previously resurrected Han who appeared to die in ""Tokyo Drift"" by explaining that the events of that film took place chronologically after the events of the fourth fifth and sixth films. Soon Dom has most of the old band back together along with a promise from Hobbs of immunity for all if they succeed in stopping Shaw in his tracks. (Sitting this one out fast-talking Puerto Rican hustlers Leo and Santos last seen gambling away their ""Fast Five"" winnings somewhere on the French Riviera.) And if teamwork has always been the principal subtext of the ""Fast"" movies ""Furious 6"" is the most overtly Hawksian of the lot pitting Doms belief in family and trust against the mercenary Shaw who treats his people as expendably as spark plugs. A mid-film pit stop in Los Angeles further ties these new events to those of the 2009 pic while a juicy post-credits tag both closes the ""Tokyo Drift"" time loop and sets up the already announced ""Fast amp; Furious 7"" (to be directed by ""Saw"" helmer James Wan). Its a perfectly adequate plot for a movie thats really about finding new ways of making cars do things cars arent supposed to do like tumbling end over end through the lobby of a London office building or in the movies most spectacular image dangling from the wings of a mighty Russian cargo plane. Lin has spoken of using toy cars as a reference when plotting out each films exuberantly destructive action setpieces and the end results often retain the feel of a child happily smashing his own toys to pieces. That was especially true of ""Fast Fives"" spectacular finish in which two Dodge Chargers plowed through the streets of downtown Rio de Janeiro towing an enormous steel bank vault behind them. A hard act to follow for sure but ""Furious 6"" manages to come awfully close in an exhilarating pursuit along a winding Canaries highway with Shaw at the wheel of a Chieftain army tank crushing full-sized cars as if they were made of candy glass. All of it is staged by Lin alongside returning cameraman Stephen F. Windon and an expert team of stunt coordinators and second unit directors with a keen attention to spatial geography and a preference for capturing complicated pieces of action in single continuous shots. Their work here stands shoulder to shoulder with the best of the Bond and ""Mission Impossible"" films as does the vivid soundwork by mixer John Casali designer Peter Brown and re-recording mixers Frank A. Montano and Jon Taylor who create a 3D environment one needs no special glasses to appreciate. Film Review Fast amp; Furious 6Reviewed at AMC Loews 34th Street New York May 7 2013. MPAA Rating PG-13.
