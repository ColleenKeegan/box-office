"Van Helsing cursed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Van Helsing cursed. Van Helsing cursed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 7 2004 709 PM Curse of the Vampire Van Helsing a feeble imitation of classic horror. By David Edelstein You cant go until I say you can go ... You dont have to adore traditional horror movies--both the American classics and the colorful British remakes--to loathe every second of Stephen SommersVan Helsing (Universal). But it helps. It helps to know the movies that this giftless writer-director is ripping off to appreciate how little he brings to the party. We live in an era rich in genre pastiches but filmmakers like Tim Burton (Sleepy Hollow) Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill) and Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy) manage both to sample from their inspirations and soulfully transform them. Sommers whose previous efforts were The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001) is a dim bulb powered by a giant studio trust fund. He makes empty but vulgarly extravagant special-effects fests Donald Trump horror movies. The vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing of Bram Stokers novel Dracula is a little old Dutchman--which is more or less how he was played (by Edward Van Sloan) until Peter Cushing reinvented him as a crisp no-nonsense English academic given to desperate feats of swashbuckling in the marvelous climaxes of Hammers Horror of Dracula (1958) and Brides of Dracula (1960). Sommers steals from those movies along with Hammers later CaptainKronos Vampire Hunter (1973)--a precursor of Buffy and Blade (1998). But he cant be bothered to give his protagonist any character tics so the splendid Hugh Jackman--who has a brooding magnetism in roles as various as the Wolverine in X-Men (2000) and Curly in Oklahoma (1999)--is just a mannequin acting with his costume. Advertisement This Van Helsing name of Gabriel is supposed to be some kind of immortal but he has amnesia (I think) so its never too clear where he came from or why the movies dullard Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) seems drawn to him. For all we know hes the Wolverine. Dracula covets the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley) who carries some sort of life force that can power scores of little vampirish thingies he has hanging from the ceiling in slimy cocoons ... I think theyre like his test-tube babies (with his vampire brides) but the details are murky. He seems to want to rule the world like a James Bond villain. Dracula also covets werewolf slaves--except that werewolves are the only things that can kill him which means he either has a death wish or Sommers just ran out of monsters. Van Helsing is the old Universal House of Frankenstein (1944) plus Horror of Dracula (1958) and Kronos whirled together and supersized. Its empty calories There isnt a single nourishing non-synthetic sequence in the entire movie. Not a scene. Not a line. Not a look. There are special-effects miracles--swirling female wraiths that whoosh through castle windows and plunge into deep gorges a sad Frankensteins monster whos a short-circuiting wreck of electrified body parts a reluctant werewolf who literally shreds his own skin--but nothing leads up to them and they fade from memory as fast as the next special effect comes at you. Kate Beckinsale managed to be scrumptious even in the blue-drenched and discordant Underworld (2003) but here shes saddled with a bum Transylvanian accent and a part that consists largely of fighting off wraithlike Vampiras who hiss things through their elongated fangs like ""You cant go until I say you can go and I say you can go when youre dead"" Its not even smart enough to be camp; its like a 12-year-olds idea of sophisticated banter. You have to feel for the army of talented FX people who must have spent months on scenes like that--trying to compensate with their artistry for the lack of dramatic logic--and having to listen to those lines over and over. By the time they could go they must have been dead. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

In the midst of the cartoony mess that is this movie that twitch is reassuring indicating that at least somebody was in on the joke. Perhaps Jackman who Ive long suspected of not reading screenplays very carefully (how else to explain ""Kate and Leopold""?) realized too late that hed booked passage on a sinking ship and simply decided to have a little fun. It doesnt help the movie much but at least when you giggle youll have some company on screen. Because really this movie is just too silly for words. Ostensibly a turn-of-the-century monster-hunting adventure reminiscent of the old Universal monster flicks from the 30s it comes off as a cross between an edgy shampoo commercial and a really elaborate ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. Jackman lustrous hair flowing strides through the film as vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing who is summoned to Transylvania to dispatch the evil Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh hammy as an Easter dinner). Soon Van Helsing locks eyes with Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) a raven-haired gypsy princess whose family has been stalked by Dracula and well they join forces and fight vampires for two nuance-free hours. Supposedly theres a romance between the two of them but you cant really tell -- they always look on the verge of whipping out dueling bottles of styling mousse. Though director Stephen Sommers who made the equally silly ""Mummy"" movies is credited with the screenplay its hard to imagine ""Van Helsing"" as having been actually written -- it seems to have mutated itself into existence on some scary operating table like the Frankenstein monster who drops in and out of the movie. (So does Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde Igor Dr. Victor Frankenstein and other Universal monster-movie staples though Sommers obvious fondness for them is marred by a shot of Mr. Hydes butt crack.) Its really just one special-effects shot after another delivered at breakneck speed. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Van Helsing"" with Hugh Jackman Kate Beckinsale Richard Roxburgh David Wenham Shuler Hensley Elena Anaya. Written and directed by Stephen Sommers. 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 for nonstop creature action violence and frightening images and for sensuality. Several theaters. This leaves the actors nothing to do but pose and pose they do showing off the work of an out-of-control design department. Beckinsale for example has been gotten up like the female counterpart of Johnny Depp in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in dominatrix boots too much eyeliner and curly tresses that fall over one eye like a goth Veronica Lake. (You wonder how she can even see the vampires let alone fight them.) And the evil Vampire Brides -- several of whom seem styled to look like Nicole Kidman after a few good meals -- shriek at random intervals and writhe for the camera like theyre supermodels on a Vogue photo shoot. Sommers directs as if hes unaware of how ridiculous it all is -- like the constant shots of Beckinsale racing out of camera range (an entirely understandable instinct) or the spotty Zsa Zsa Gabor accents employed by much of the cast or the fact that Jackman finally removes his shirt in the final 10 minutes of the movie like a special parting gift to the audience. Let it be said that I laughed harder at this film than at ""Envy"" the so-called comedy that opened in theaters last week. If ""Van Helsing"" wasnt exactly meant to be a comedy -- well these days you take your fun where you can find it.

(AP Photo/Universal / ... more Van Helsing a monstrosity of a movie 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Van Helsing Action. Starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Directed by Stephen Sommers. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Van Helsing"" may be ambitious in scale but its unambitious in every other way. Writer-director Stephen Sommers (""The Mummy"") throws together plot strains from various horror movies and stories and tries to muscle things along with flash and dazzle. But his film just lies there weighted down by a complete lack of wit artfulness and internal logic. So its a disaster -- a big loud boring wreck -- but to say that isnt enough. ""Van Helsing"" has the look of a failed experiment as well and that makes it almost interesting. Almost. What Sommers tries to do here is use action as the only means of involving an audience. So story is sacrificed. Character development is nonexistent and there are no attempts to incite emotion. Instead Sommers tries to hold an audience for two hours with nothing up his sleeve but colored ribbons bright sparklers and a kazoo. What he proves is that this is no way to make movies. A sinking feeling sets in within minutes. Van Helsing is in Paris tracking down Dr. Jekyll who in his Hyde mode is computer generated. (Imagine that a potion that turns a man into a computer graphic.) They get into a battle -- who knows why or cares? -- atop Notre Dame cathedral with virtually every moment of every shot artificially created the soundtrack blaring all the way. The juxtaposition of Van Helsing and Hyde has a random mindlessness to it and its soon followed by other random juxtapositions (the Wolf Man Frankenstein Dracula) best suited to an Abbott and Costello farce. Related Stories The horror the horror -- Van Helsing all too scary But no we soon catch on This is no farce. Sommers is serious. And oh no we also realize Theres no one on deck here who can write a story. From then on we know ""Van Helsing"" promises to be one long slog. In that way and in only that way the movie fulfills its promise. What can Hugh Jackman do? He stalks the film in what looks like a turtleneck from Old Navy playing a man with no recognizable psychological structure. The vague glances at a back story make no sense. Were told hes a contract killer working for the Vatican killing evil entities. He doesnt remember his past but it has something to do with Transylvania and so he takes an assignment to kill Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) whos acting up. Jackman has nothing to play but blank good looks. Ditto for Kate Beckinsale as Anna the woman at the head of Draculas hit list. The movie outfits her with pirate boots and a Romanian corset but past that shes on her own a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmakers whimsy. The movie is numbingly hyperactive. Here vampires can attack day or night and they do relentlessly particularly Draculas three wives merry female bats who delight in taunting their victims. In between bat attacks the slender yet convoluted story doesnt exactly unfold. It just gets announced now and then as the characters state the premise of scenes to each other as though at a pitch meeting. Dracula wants two things. He wants to kill Anna and he wants to find the Frankenstein monster. Apparently Frankenstein contains the secret of life and Dracula wants to create life. He wants lots of little Draculas out there depopulating the earth of humans and competing for an ever-decreasing blood supply. Obviously Dracula hasnt thought this through. But why should he? Sommers didnt even decide if Dracula should be a funny or serious character. The film veers wildly in tone from mirthless comedy to bland drama caught in a dead zone its writer-director out of control. The Wolf Man makes several appearances alternately ferocious and forlorn in the usual Wolf Man way and its an odd thing. Today the technology is there to make the transformation convincing and yet seeing it means exactly nothing to us -- so much less than when poor Lon Chaney Jr. would struggle in those old movies trying to hold onto his humanity even as he sprouted fur all over his body. I suppose when theres no humanity to begin with theres nothing to hold onto and thus no loss and no drama. Still its daunting. To think of all the tools Sommers had at his command -- all the money all the computer wizardry -- and yet his film has no more art than what a chimpanzee might do with an Etch a Sketch. Throughout the movie Dracula tries to re-create life from without as though high-voltage technology could replace that which comes from within. Talk about metaphors. Once they believe that lie mad scientists and filmmakers will get in trouble every time. Advisory This film contains shootings stabbings Wolf Man violence and vampire sensuality.

(Related video See a clip from Van Helsing) Hugh Jackman is out to off Transylvanias biggest bloodsucker in Van Helsing. Universal Studios The filmmakers are taking pains to avoid spoilers cautioning everyone who has seen the movie not to reveal what transpires in the final half-hour. What they dont warn us about is how much the movie begins to drag at about the 90-minute mark. And theres still almost 45 minutes to go. The hero of the title who is played by Hugh Jackman is a famous hunter in the 19th century of all those deemed dangerously evil. His assignment is to high-tail it to Transylvania to dispose of the regions most famous nocturnal bloodsucker played by Richard Roxburgh. In the movies most original twist Van Helsings orders come from a top-secret ecumenical religious cabal based in Rome. Muslim clerics work alongside Buddhist monks and Catholic priests in their collaborative effort to rid the world of evil. From our modern vantage point the notion of such intra-religious cooperation seems almost as far-fetched as the existence of bat-winged vampires and hirsute werewolves. Though the real contest is between Van Helsing and Dracula Frankenstein and a couple of other creatures figure into the story. No matter that Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley and whoever invented werewolves didnt set their stories in the same place or time. A convoluted plot is woven around the characters but the multi-fanged approach does produce more monstrous bang for our buck. Even Victor Frankenstein the monsters creator makes a brief appearance. One almost expects to see Frau Blucher from Young Frankenstein. The dashing Jackman plays his part well enough but the script doesnt provide sufficient Indiana Jones-style bons mots to win us over. Van Helsing is about what youd expect from Stephen Sommers who directed the mediocre but hugely successful Mummy. It does have a more handsome look than the Mummy movies but this re-telling of Dracula hardly counts. (PG-13 for action violence frightening images and sensuality.

"Van Helsing | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; van-helsing ) Van Helsing (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the 1930s monster movies were the staples of Universal Pictures line-up a cash cow as the industry metamorphosed from silent films to talkies. Although the monsters came in all sizes and flavors none could match the appeal of the ""Big Three"" Dracula Frankenstein (a misnomer a properly it should be ""Frankensteins creation"") and The Wolf Man. By the early 40s however the monsters were getting long in the tooth and losing their appeal. Karloff had traded in the boots and make-up for mad scientist roles. Lugosi had hung up his cape. And Chaney had begun multi-tasking. In 1943 in an attempt to revive interest Universal introduced the first of three cross-over films in which more than one of the Big Three appeared. That was Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (the two principals are obvious). A modest success it was followed by House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula both of which featured all three. The ""golden era"" of Univeral monster movies officially ended in 1948 when Dracula Frankenstein and the Wolf Man met Abbott and Costello. This final movie has not aged well and represents little more than a painfully embarrassing footnote to a series of films that grew increasingly more campy with each new sequel. Turn the calendar ahead nearly 50 years. Writer/director Stephen Sommers the man who brought The Mummy back from the grave and turned it into a successful franchise has decided to attempt the same with the Big Three. Its a nice idea and at least in principle appeals greatly to the 8-year old inside of me. Yet even the Creature Double Feature-addicted child that I once was would be appalled by the results. Sommers has conclusively proven that some things are better left buried. Despite being armed with the latest in special effects technology (which he overuses and abuses) Sommers has crafted a trio of monsters that are even more woebegone than they were in the Abbott and Costello encounter. Van Helsing is the worst would-be summer blockbuster since Battlefield Earth. Before I start mercilessly shredding this movie let me offer a silver lining. Those who delight in bad movies and enjoy producing their own unfilmed versions of Mystery Science Theater 3000 may gain a measure of semi-masochistic enjoyment out of Van Helsing. There are quite a few unintentionally funny moments although the overall experience was too intensely painful for me to be able to advocate it as being ""so bad its good."" (The length is part of the problem - boredom eventually overwhelms cheesiness.) Some however will doubtless view it as such. More power to them since sitting through this movie requires something more than a strong constitution and a capacity for self-torture. The storyline is simple enough as befits a screenplay written with pre-pubescent boys in mind. Its also excruciatingly dumb but that probably wont come as a surprise to many people. After all how many smart monster movies are there? Late 19th-century superhero Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) arrives in Transylvania at the behest of a secret religious organization to stop Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) from spreading his evil across the world. With the help of local vampire hunter Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) Van Helsing stalks Dracula who is searching for Frankensteins monster (Shuler Hensley). The monster is apparently very good with electricity and Dracula needs his help to give birth to a swarm of baby vampires. To make matters more difficult for Van Helsing and Anna the count has a pet werewolf on hand not to mention three harpy wives. Then there are all those bats cobwebs and inconvenient electrical storms. Each of the principals has an assistant. The vampire is served by Igor (Kevin J. OConnor) who appears to have arrived here fresh out of Young Frankenstein and Van Helsing is abetted by Friar Carl (David Wenham) who is obviously an ancestor of 007s Q. Van Helsing has an unfortunate case of amnesia which thankfully saves us from having to learn about his past - the present is bad enough. This raises the question of whether all Hugh Jackman superheroes have memory problems. Cut Van Helsings hair and give him long fingernails and youd have Wolverine - except that Jackmans performance in X-Men is considerably better. In fact the only reason Jackman doesnt come across as inept is because hes surrounded by actors who are doing worse jobs. Kate Beckinsales performance for example makes one yearn for the superior work she turned out in Pearl Harbor (the less said about her accent or with it the better). Richard Roxburgh portrays Dracula as a cross between Tinkerbell and his frothing-at-the-mouth Duke in Moulin Rouge. The count would have been better served had the filmmakers violated Bela Lugosis grave and propped up the dead actors corpse. And Shuler Hensley offers a Frankensteins monster thats more Herman Munster than Karloff. Not all of the humor in Van Helsing is unintentional although everything thats actually funny is. The scripted comedy is feeble such as when Friar Carl falls over a couch backwards. Now thats a moment guaranteed to bring down the house with laughter. (Sommers was slightly but not greatly more successful integrating humor into the Mummy movies.) In the interests of keeping the MPAA rating PG-13 the violence has been toned down so that the most gruesome stuff occurs just off camera. Also Draculas three topless harpy wives do not have nipples and when they appear in human form their naked flesh becomes mysteriously covered by a bikini top. Its easy enough to praise the set design which is wasted in a movie such as this. Sure the castles all look great but so what? The special effects have the cheesy artificial look of computer generated images that have not been effectively incorporated. The werewolf and vampire transformations are downright silly. And the climactic battle is between two soulless anonymous CGI creations. At least in The Matrix Revolutions Neo and Smith were mostly played by human beings. Here were essentially seeing animation - technically slick but emotionally inert and not even briefly exciting. Curiously Universal distributed a notice to critics requesting that we keep the final 30 minutes of the movie under wraps so as not to spoil the ""surprises"" for potential viewers. I would be more than happy to oblige but I cant figure out what those secrets are. The only thing startling about the final half-hour is that its just as bad as the preceding 100 minutes. I suppose we learn why Van Helsing is named ""Gabriel"" instead of ""Abraham"" (as in Stokers book) but the explanation doesnt make much more sense than the random set of rules that Sommers establishes for vampires and werewolves. Somehow I dont think the bloodsuckers in this film are any more averse to garlic than Emeril Lagasse. Most monster movies are entrenched in the horror genre but so little about Van Helsing is scary that Sommers is forced to rely on action. Theres plenty of that but each set piece outlasts its welcome and the exposition that fills the interludes is hollow and boring. 15 minutes into the movie were already tired of the artificiality of the fights and chases but theres still two hours to go. Van Helsing quickly becomes an exercise in repetition which leads to tedium. Watching a movie about vampires werewolves and other assorted monsters is supposed to be fun not drudgery. After enduring the atrocities perpetrated upon them by Sommers (which will not have any more of a lasting effect than the encounter with Abbott and Costello) hopefully the Big Three can return to their resting places where they will remain undisturbed by that most heinous of motion picture possibilities Van Helsing 2.

A monster mash on steroids ""Van Helsing"" takes Universals hallowed horror cycle to a new level. Whether that level is the pinnacle or the nadir will be a matter of distinctly divided opinion depending very much on viewer age respect for genre tradition and appetite for being pummeled by nonstop CGI effects and a thunderous soundtrack. Fans of Bela Lugosi Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr. will be appalled but the audience that counts at the B.O. Stephen Sommers ""Mummy"" hordes will no doubt eat it up indicating monstrous early returns for the first of the seasons hugely pricey putative blockbusters. Idea of sending the vampire hunter created by Bram Stoker in his 1897 ""Dracula"" novel up against not only the count but Frankensteins monster and Wolf Man with Mr. Hyde briefly thrown in for good measure appears intriguing on paper. Sommers no doubt thought long and hard about how to make a sensible team of these fabled creatures each of which has its own literary and cinematic mythology but have also been combined before. In the end the concoction seems far more contrived than plausible but the sense of evil overkill is entirely representative of the picture itself which repeatedly looks ready to blow all its fuses due to sensory overload. Packed with nothing but ""big scenes"" and breathlessly paced in a way that suggests panic at the idea the audience might get bored if things were slowed and toned down even for a moment pic opens in voluptuous black-and-white with a nine-minute Transylvanian prologue set in 1887 in which Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) puts the bite on Dr. Frankenstein in an attempt to adopt the monster for his own private purposes. But this comes just as angry locals are laying siege to the castle ending in a calamitous windmill fire. Bleeding into subdued color prologue No. 2 presents the long-maned leather-coated ultra-macho Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) battling it out in Paris with the legendary Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane) who here is transformed into an uglier big brother of Fat Bastard. What the point is of disfiguring Robert Louis Stevensons creation to such a noxious extent is anyones guess but it does serve notice that this is not going to be your fathers monster movie; after all the Van Helsing character as written by Stoker was about 60 and considerably older than that as fiercely played by Edward Van Sloane in the original ""Dracula."" Paris sequence is notable only for the grace note of one cityscape shot revealing the Eiffel Tower under construction up to the second level. From there its on to Rome. The Vatican will be pleased to learn that in the late 19th century the busiest and most advanced laboratory for weapons of mass destruction was located directly under St. Peters for it is here that Van Helsing seemingly in the employ of a church-run secret society is conducted on a James Bond-like tour of a facility explicitly manned by inventors of all religions colors and creeds and equipped with all the fabulous new gadgets hell need on his new assignment including a rapid-fire crossbow to go along with his twin rotary handsaws. Accompanied by a comic-relief vampire expert a chatty friar named Carl (David Wenham) Van Helsing (here rechristened Gabriel rather than Abraham) sails for Transylvania where he is to try to prevent the death-by-Dracula of the last two remaining members of a family long devoted to vampire destruction gypsy princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp). As soon as Van Helsing arrives to a reception akin to that of Americans in Fallouja the village is attacked by Draculas brides who in the manner of three marauding pterodactyls dive-bomb the central square and take peasants airborne in their talons. While Van Helsing fires away with his fancy arsenal Anna is tossed hither and yon executing fancy ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" acrobatics as she goes and otherwise proves that none of the normal rules of gravity physics human dexterity or pain apply in this venture. The same goes for dramatic logic or building of suspense. Sommers knows how to startle an audience -- hes big into suddenly dropping hideous faces into the frame from above -- but never develops any sense of creepiness or dread because he wont take the time to do so. As a result the vast mythology readily available through these characters never takes hold and these iconic figures carry no resonance. Pic casts most of the familiar motifs to the wind Dracula is no longer bothered by light crucifixes garlic holy water and so on but its not explained why not and the sole remaining way Dracula can be killed is revealed only late in the game. The interim is filled with more moments of life-or-death jeopardy than an Indiana Jones installment. Any number of times Dracula or his brides have their toothsome mouths wide open ready for the deep plunge when they are rudely interrupted; the Frankenstein monster and Velkan who is tragically transformed into a werewolf early on are repeatedly strapped down and noisily electrified and characters go through grotesque transformations from human to beast and back so many times that even the outstanding visual effects used to render them become tiresomely routine. A token attempt is made to link Dracula and Van Helsing in centuries past -- the latter at one point mentions without explanation that he was at Masada -- but it fails to add any dimension to their enmity so overwhelmed is the picture by frenzied assaults and attacks and meaningless sound and fury. Most eye-catching set piece is a vampires ball staged in Pragues imposing St. Nicholas Church and choreographed by Cirque du Soleils Debra Brown with the requisite trapeze stunts and circus acts. At this stage Dracula has kidnapped Anna to make her his latest bride and in the films most arresting shot he leads her in front of a large mirror to reveal that shes the only real human being on the dance floor (at least this one vampire tradition remains intact). Although he cuts a fine figure as always Jackman is straitjacketed from creating what could be called a real characterization by the undersupply of dialogue that relates to anything other than the threat at hand and by the overwhelming nature of the physical production. Equipped with a mittel European accent and coping with a milieu not much different than the one she inhabited in ""Underworld"" Beckinsale is a kick-butt-minded heroine who protests too much that she needs no help from Van Helsing; romantic angle between the two is there in principle but never felt. Roxburgh comes off as a rock star Dracula oozing mean-spirited menace when a little charm would have gone a long way. Wenham does OK with thin material as the eager-to-please friar who usefully recounts historical and ancestral details when necessary. Shuler Hensleys Frankensteins monster resembles the prototype more than his colleagues and captures a measure of the characters poignancy to boot. Overdone as they are the effects are superbly rendered delivering the thrills and shocks the intended audience will pay to see. Same is true of Allan Camerons spectacularly dark production design Allen Daviaus superbly judged shadowy cinematography (if only he could have shot the whole thing in black-and-white) the coolly inventive costumes by Gabriella Pescucci and Carlo Poggioli and the innumerable visual special and makeup effects by a team so large the end credits take 10 minutes to unspool. On the other hand composer Alan Silvestri hits every music cue at fortissimo and one might suspect director Sommers of being hard of hearing so amped up is the sound level at all times. Vast project is surrounded not only by the expected marketing blitz but by several related ventures including three ""Monster Legacy"" DVD sets relating to the three prominent creatures; a ""Van Helsing"" interactive game; an animated DVD called ""Van Helsing The London Assignment"" which details the heros earlier hunt for Mr. Hyde; a new attraction o n the Universal tour called ""Van Helsing Fortress Dracula""; and an upcoming TV series from Sommers and producing partner Bob Ducsay for Universal and NBC called ""Transylvania.""
