Starring Joan Allen Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman. Written and directed by Rod Lurie. (Rated R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Just when Al Gore thought he had successfully put Bill and Monica in a lockbox along comes Rod Luries ""The Contender"" to remind everybody about hanky-panky in high places. Message from Al Thanks a lot Rod. Lurie is the writer-director of this White House drama starring the formidable Joan Allen as a senator tapped to replace a vice president who died midterm. The senator has a sexual history that her political opponents are itching to exploit. Speaking of exploitation todays release date for ""The Contender"" just as the presidential campaign crests could not possibly be more timely. The inside-politics flurry of wheeling and dealing hardballing and sandbagging on and off the screen makes for a terrific time at the movies. ""The Contender"" is thoroughly engrossing even if Lurie cant resist an inclination toward bait and switch. Allen is superb as the highly principled liberal senator but Jeff Bridges as the disarming wily president who nominates her as his second in command and fends off their enemies saunters off with the show. Politicians must be actors too and this movie is full of opportunities for the real actors who play them. Gary Oldman resists going for caricature and finds an oddly sympathetic strain as a weasely right-wing congressman. Beefy William Peterson is a paragon of solidity and a team player too as a heroic governor with his sights on national office. Sam Elliott gimlet-eyed as the presidents tough chief of staff is convincing even in one beautiful moment when he brazenly lies through his teeth. The mudslinging begins when the presidents enemies circulate what they claim are sexually compromising photos of Sen. Laine Hanson (Allen) made years before at a college fraternity initiation. Her response is to flatly refuse to comment as a matter of principle. She will not deny the accusation because ""it is simply beneath my dignity."" She sticks to her guns. A confirmation-hearing confrontation with Rep. Shelly Runyon (Oldman) sizzles with undercurrents. Allen plays the senator as tightly wound but cool and self-possessed and there is no irony in her closing statement a Capraesque recital of her political credo with uplifting music on the soundtrack. ""The Contender"" makes the Clinton reminders explicit. The senator a Republican turned Democrat voted to impeach him. ""He was not guilty but responsible"" she says. Oldman with frizzy comb-over and a Midwestern accent comes across as more professorial than monstrous but even the congressmans wife fears he will go down in the history books as ""a second-rate Joe McCarthy."" He plants innuendos in the record of the hearing under a pose of sympathetic concern and lets slip the Web site where surfers can get more dirt. In the public hearing Runyon keeps circling around the senators sex life as if there were something wrong with it and then asks her what she would do if she got pregnant in office. In private she declares ""If I were a man nobody would care how many sex partners I had in college"" and her language gets graphic ""Theres one thing you dont want and thats a woman with her finger on the button who isnt getting laid."" Anyone skeptical of politicians would be well advised to be skeptical of movies about them too. Elements of Luries screenplay are something of a tease. The movie also gets preachy but the important thing is that dramatically the preachiness works. Bridges is a stalwart screen actor who has received a passel of Oscar nominations (""Starman"" ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" ""The Last Picture Show"") but never the prize. This may be the time. President Jackson Evans personal quirks disguise how crafty he is. He is as capable of sweet-talking someone as he is of setting them up for a fall. Away from the press the president is a secret smoker and constantly orders snacks from the White House kitchen. (Food is a minor theme in this film. The evil congressman is a meat eater and the good senator a vegetarian.) Bridges lets the presidents rough edges show in little flashes. He sniffs a shoe before slipping it on. He lets out a scream to let off steam. Theres a great scene between Bridges and Christian Slater as a freshman congressman in the White House reception room filled with presidential portraits. (None of the White House locations are real. It is all done on soundstages with reproductions of the decor.) Kathryn Morris makes a big impression as an FBI investigator. She may appear ingenuous but her interviewing technique is sharklike. ""The Contender"" features another one of those cameo appearances by Larry King. Doesnt anybody notice that these celebrity cameos intended to give a sense of verisimilitude have the opposite effect? This one looks exactly like what it is the real Larry King interviewing a big- name actor pretending to be somebody else. Both of them look fake. -- Advisory This film contains explicit sexual references. ..

Like his first film ""The Contender"" is set in the political arena and revolves around the power elite. In his sophomore effort the political melodrama ""The Contender"" Rod Lurie shows vast improvement as a writer and director over his feature debut ""Deterrence"" which was both an artistic and commercial disappointment. Like his first film ""The Contender"" is set in the political arena and revolves around the power elite. But unlike that 1999 wannabe thriller the subject matter of the new pic is more interesting the range of issues more challenging and the mode more entertaining. Heading a gifted ensemble Joan Allen shines as a Vice Presidential nominee who decides to take the high moral ground when her candidacy is smeared by a sex scandal from her youth. With the right handling the DreamWorks release may score modest numbers provided the election season offers conducive environment and not an obstacle. Lurie is obviously enamored of the political film a genre thats all but vanished from mainstream American cinema. If ""Deterrence"" was an outgrowth of such 1960s pics as ""Fail Safe"" ""The Contender"" is more in the vein of ""Advise and Consent"" with its expose of Washingtons wheeling and dealing. ""Contender"" suffers from being too obvious and verbose. Moreover by wearing its idealistic sentiments on its sleeves pic falls short of its goal to be a provocative expose about the increasingly blurred line between the public and private arena and the inevitable impingement of candidates past behavior on their present standing. Yarn begins when Sen. Jack Hathaway (William Petersen) out on a fishing trip observes a tragic accident in which a red car slides off the bridge and sinks into a lake. Without a blink he jumps into the water but its too late to save the woman trapped inside. Already respected for his integrity Jacks status is boosted by his heroics which increases his chances to be nominated as second-in-command to President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) when the sitting VP suddenly dies. (Similar plot device was used in ""Deterrence"" when Kevin Pollacks President Emerson takes office after the incumbent Presidents death). Much to everyones amazement the President decides to appoint a woman Sen. Laine Hanson (Joan Allen). Ending his second term Jackson feels that nominating a woman for the job is the right thing to do. Not surprisingly his selection meets with opposition not only from his staff members but also from members of both parties particularly Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) a powerful adversary who will stop at nothing to discredit Jacksons candidate. Hansons confirmation hearings set off controversy when it turns out that she is a former Republican who switched parties. A further investigation reveals a shocking incident from Hansons past supported by photographs taken during a sexual orgy with two men while she was in college. Hanson doesnt deny the accusations which threaten both her political future and her personal life as shes now happily married and the mother of a young boy. Hansons courage emerges when she takes the stand and refuses to give in despite coercion from both sides. In the first reels Lurie finds interesting ways to introduce a gallery of colorful characters that include White House staff members Kermit Newman (Sam Elliott) and Jerry Toliver (Saul Rubineck). Through smooth transitions he exposes the central personas pasts and motivations. There are several wonderfully acted episodes such as the one that shows a meeting between Hanson and her critical father politician Oscar Billings (the splendid Philip Baker Hall). Unfortunately pic is more about debatable principles than real politics and in the second excessively schematic half Lurie throws into the mix various issues (abortion women in politics) just in order to expose different points of view. Though serving up the plot the sudden revelations in the last act are not very convincing. Lurie propagates old-fashioned values such as moral integrity and sincerity of character. ""The Contender"" may be dismissed by harsh critics as an idealistic fable for the 1990s one that depicts America as a society in which women are given fair shot in which there are no double standards and in which high principles are cherished and rewarded in politics. The large talented cast elevates the film above the trappings of its loquacious debates particularly Allen who uses her trademark intelligence and dignity to to give a commanding performance. Playing the films most cliched role a President whos more interested in gourmet food than in issues Bridges is entertaining. The hardly recognizable Oldman (also credited as exec producer) enacts the nasty elements of his part with relish. In small roles the rest of the ensemble is equally good. Tech credits are proficient across the board as befits the modestly scaled production.

Petersen Christian Slater; Director Rod Lurie; Author Rod Lurie; Producer (group) Battleground Productions Cinecontender; Release Date Wide 10/13/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 126; MPAA Rating R Posted October 20 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT A political thriller as susceptible to hot-button issues in this election year as Al Gore is susceptible to wardrobe consultants The Contender has everything on its side except the courage of its convictions. Which is all the more dismaying because writer-director Rod Luries convictions are paraded with such attention-grabbing indignation. Its the final term of Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) an American President so commanding yet so humble and at ease -- the full Martin Sheen thing -- that he is perpetually joyfully amazed at his right to order outlandish meals from the White House kitchen at any hour. Evans is expansive likable and respectful of the awesome office he holds -- the full Jeff Bridges thing. As a post-Clintonian character he shows many of our outgoing Presidents positive traits (charisma charm appetite) with none of the negatives. But between bites of shark sandwich Evans advances an important agenda The recent death of the Vice President means the President has a chance to make history by appointing a woman to fill the vacancy. The contender of choice is Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) a U.S. senator with seemingly impeccable credentials. Shes the daughter of a retired Republican governor and a convert to the Democratic party. Shes seasoned and respected. And we know shes happily monogamously married because even though she and her husband are parents of a cute son the lovebirds still enjoy knocking boots on her office desk. Hansons appointment is opposed however by Rep. Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) a bitter political adversary so retro in his tastes that he still wears Cold War-style eyeglasses and noisily chomps blood-red meat. Runyons in a lather not only because hes a Republican (and therefore in Hollywood expected to froth) but also because he feels humiliated that his own more tractable VP choice (William Petersen) has been nixed. So as chairman of the subcommittee in charge of the appointment hearings he goes after Hanson with all the dirt he can fling. By which of course -- this being the era of the Starr Report as pornography -- he means accusations of sexual scandal. Going back decades to college days Runyons scavengers unearth gossip that young single Laine allegedly took part in a frat-house bacchanal trading sexual favors for sorority admittance. Someone even vomits up photos. Hanson however calmly and adamantly refuses to comment or answer questions. Her private life she insists is nobodys business but her own. Period. Lurie a former entertainment reporter and movie critic cites All the Presidents Men The Candidate and The Parallax View as influences. And he knows how to run some flashy maneuvers on the playing field employing secondary players to serve as human position papers. Bridges glistens sleek while Oldman grinds and sputters; aged by makeup and an extraordinary wig from which angry tufts shoot out of a receding hairline he plays a conservative Republican as creepily repressed as Democrats are meant to be admirably lusty. (Hanson may have changed party affiliations so she could get some.) Joan Allen meanwhile fills her character with all the sexual juice the actress has had to stanch in a fine career playing frustrated women from the First Lady in Nixon to the tamped-down housewives in Pleasantville and The Ice Storm. With her long dancerly elegance accentuated by a wardrobe of tunic jackets and turned-up white collars that emphasize her swan neck she makes Hanson a model of personal dignity creating a character as well-done as Oldmans is overcooked. As Anita Hill and Monica Lewinsky might readily recognize the movie deviously encourages viewers to fantasize about the woman doing the nasty and Allen factors that humiliation too into her beautiful performance. The Contender booms and pontificates full of bravado and that ineffable quality of the current political season chutzpah. But what it doesnt do -- what The West Wing does on television week after week with far less bombast and more substance -- is convey a sense of Washington as a place of fast-paced multitasking. In Luries District of Columbia Hanson-bashing is the only thing on Runyons calendar. Too in the end the movie only pretends to be enlightened liberal. At a crucial turn -- one that I suppose ought not to be revealed even though it riles me so much I could spit -- the filmmaker caves. Whether this is out of cowardice or the essential prudish conservatism of Hollywood I cant say. But while the discrepancy may make for a lively debate as to whether this latest addition to the canon of political thrillers in fact mirrors our own waffly focus-group-driven times it makes for a badly compromised drama. The Contender engages in the cinematic equivalent of not inhaling. The result is only a contact high. B- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

(Gino Mifud/DreamWorks) Its devastating what an unfortunate lapse in the latter stages of a movie can do. Suddenly the whole film feels like a disaster even if everything was going swimmingly until then. Such is human perception. And such is the case with ""The Contender"" a thoroughly engrossing inside-Washington thriller that trips headlong on its political agenda. This is a tragedy because ""The Contender"" starring Joan Allen in a standout role has so much going for it. I was having a great time with this well-wrought Washington thriller - which doesnt need a high body count to keep you on the edge of your seat. The story then. President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges in a fine funny performance) a Democrat is casting about for someone to replace his late vice president. So he selects Laine Hanson a senator who switched ranks from the Republicans. Suddenly President Evans is on the verge of creating a great legacy installing the first female vice president in history. But Hanson faces stiff resistance from Republican congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) and his confirmation committee which includes wet-behind-the-ears Democrat freshman Reginald Webster (Christian Slater). Runyon a pro-life pro-school prayer Republican who prefers a charismatic male governor (William Peterson)as the next VP has no intention of confirming the more liberal female candidate. The meat of this movie is the way Runyon works behind the scenes to further his agenda. Cue the Right Wing Conspiracy Suddenly on the Internet there are pictures of a younger naked Hanson at a college sex party. And theres Runyon pretending to take the higher ground at the hearings as he politely grills Hanson. Now were looking at exciting face-to-face chicken between Hanson and Runyon. This back-and-forth between the stoic Hanson and the scheming Runyon is clearly meant to evoke Hillary Clintons attempt in Hill hearings to sell the Clinton administrations health care ideas to the Republicans. And for the character of Runyon we can see many real-life models particularly former senator and Clinton adversary Alfonse DAmato. Whats Hansons explanation for this embarrassing episode in her past? How can she answer and survive this controversy? Hanson the president and his seasoned advisers (Sam Elliott and Saul Rubinek) get to work formulating a strategy. This is a movie of great performances. Its a cinch that Allen should anticipate an Oscar nomination. Bridges is a delight as the president. Elliott is superb as the seen-it-all adviser Kermit Newton who talks straight but knows how to turn on the charm. But the male actor in charge of this movie is Oldman. As Runyon hes virtually unrecognizable and utterly appealing - in spite of his manipulative underhanded ways. Runyon is operating out of conviction not just pure evil. And hes a gentleman at all times. Which makes him devilishly compelling. I cant tell you how much pleasure I had watching him. But then writer-director Rod Lurie a former film critic and entertainment reporter who made the memorable nuclear-war thriller ""Deterrence"" succumbs to heavy-handed politicizing. Obviously the audience is meant to salute President Evanss climactic State of the Union address - replete with stirring music - which states a litany of Democrat values that are at best politically divisive. Theres nothing wrong with expressing a political opinion. But this movie was originally about two equally matched sides both trying to win a political chess game. It was a thriller not a polemic. And there are some other flaws too. ""The Contender"" which takes such care to create a believable political climate throws in a fourth-quarter surprise that cheapens everything with second-rate melodrama. And though it has a noble central precept that a woman has the same right to make mistakes live it up and then go for higher office as a man does it still holds Allens character accountable for her past. Between the lines it still matters whether she indulged in sexual escapades or not. Nonetheless I can recommend the first two-thirds of this movie with great enthusiasm. Its such fun especially for Washingtonians and politicos to watch inside baseball in the Oval Office and on Capitol Hill. Sure there are some unconvincing political details. But for the most part the Washington stuff is believable enough. And given the lack of choice around us you could do worse than have a good time sitting through ""The Contender.""
