Given the notable dearth of quality fare in this genre those attributes should strike Sony with Cupids arrow in the form of reasonably happy date-night returns. Considerably heavier on romance than comedy ""Hitch"" stitches together relatively few laughs but generates enough goodwill and energy to keep much of the audience in its corner. Although the script cant sustain the premise -- and saddles the actors with some truly leaden dialogue -- a buoyant second-banana turn by Kevin James and the few chuckle-worthy moments help compensate for the arid stretches. Given the notable dearth of quality fare in this genre those attributes should strike Sony with Cupids arrow in the form of reasonably happy date-night returns. Director Andy Tennant knows about romantic comedies longer on star appeal than smarts what with ""Fools Rush In"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama"" on his resume. ""Hitch"" plods along on similar terrain albeit with the additional boon of James Gleason-esque antics -- a big round sweetly spirited lug who is awfully light on his toes. In the process ""The King of Queens"" star somewhat eclipses Will Smith as the smooth-talking ""date doctor"" -- a near-urban legend available by referral only who coaches bumbling guys through the art of romance. The twist of course is that Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens becomes all thumbs himself once faced with peeling away the hard shell of a comely gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes) who turns his dating maxims upside down. An opening sequence mixing Smiths voiceover with him directly addressing the camera offers a taste of Hitchs magic but he takes on an especially challenging project when he tries to help a shy accountant Albert (James) woo a beautiful jet-setting heiress Allegra (Amber Valletta). This isnt to say Hitch lacks a moral code. Indeed he only opens the door for nice guys lacking the moves to woo a woman refusing to assist a Wall Street sleaze who has conquest not romance in mind. Like Sara though hes resistant to love himself still cautious from a courtship-inflicted wound years before. Its all rather wispy and first-time screenwriter Kevin Bisch struggles with the juggling act of keeping the central couple apart and then bringing them back together aided by the almost-saving grace of having the Albert-Allegra storyline to fall back on. Beyond his hangdog demeanor James exhibits a flair for physical comedy and the scenes of Smith prepping him for dates -- if a little overexposed by the ad campaign -- actually possess considerably more verve than either of the romantic pairings. In the best moment Albert walks Allegra toward her door bracing for their much-rehearsed first kiss looking much like a guy being marched to a firing squad. Smith branches out a little here to the extent that this latest role is devoid of accompanying explosions while Mendes charms the camera with an ease that exceeds her thinly drawn character. Nor is there much fleshed-out support with what amount to cameos by Adam Arkin and Michael Rapaport as Saras tabloid editor and Hitchs married pal respectively. As in many a romantic comedy the juiciest supporting player is Manhattan a backdrop that goes a long way toward setting the mood along with George Fentons score. And while the film drags noticeably during its flabby closing act the cast provides pleasant enough company to survive the Hallmark-card speeches that run through it. All told ""Hitch"" plays like the oldest of old-fashioned romantic comedies which would be worth celebrating if only it was slightly better at it. Then again just as love-seeking bar patrons tend to lower their standards as the clock approaches midnight in these laugh-challenged times itll do.

Until ""Hitch"" however hes never gotten to charm the pants off a leading lady. This is his first flat-out romantic comedy and it will surprise no one to learn that hes a natural. Playing Alex (Hitch) Hitchens a New York ""date doctor"" who teaches hapless moonstruck men how to romance the women of their dreams he breezes through the role with his characteristic mix of playful braggadocio and sweet self-deprecation. Alex doesnt practice what he preaches--hurt once he wont allow himself to fall in love again. Andy Tennants flimsy but generally likeable comedy is tailor-made for Smiths cheerfully suave comic style and the movie goes out of its way to avoid any hint of sleaziness. As a dating consultant Hitch wont take on any clients who are just after a quick lay; only true lovers need apply. His altruistic approach to his profession doesnt exactly jibe with his personal philosophy of dating a contradiction Kevin Bischs feel-good screenplay exploits but fails to explore.Naturally Hitch does meet the woman of his dreams and wouldnt you know shes as commitment-phobic as he? Sara (Eva Mendes) is a beautiful but emotionally guarded gossip columnist who fends off one suitor after another until the masterly Hitch penetrates her defenses. The inevitable misunderstandings that keep them apart until the last reel are even by Hollywood romantic-comedy standards pretty contrived. Saras outrage upon learning his true profession (which he conceals) seems odd especially coming from a gossip peddler. More amusing than their predictably rocky romance is the populist subplot involving Hitchs most challenging client a meek klutzy accountant (Kevin James of TVs ""The King of Queens"") who has an impossible crush on celebrity heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Because James is such a dextrously disarming schlemiel we happily suspends disbelief when his wildest dreams seem to come true.""Hitch"" could have used more edge. Its so eager to please that its rarely as funny as the premise promises. With the exception of one arrogantly nasty Wall Street lothario its view of courtship is willfully rosy--all the men are warm-hearted lovelorn goobers who just need a little confidence to shine and all the women are great-looking babes who melt at the first sign of sincerity. Its a fantasy that will fill box-office coffers but it makes for a movie thats a little too innocuous for its own good.

Smith plays Alex Hitchens a New York date-doctor who makes a neat buck teaching sloppy men how to tidy up and snare the gal of their dreams and above their station. Professional though he is Hitch is as susceptible to loves fickle bite as anyone so when gossip queen Eva Mendes sashays across his path the little charmer finds both his heart of stone and silver tongue have turned to mush. Director Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama Anna and the King) runs a tight ship when it comes to date pics and here keeps attention away from the sinister aspects of Hitchs trade focusing instead on Smiths slick clowning and using engaging goofball underdog Kevin James to offset the leads suaveness. Both are sitcom actors James on King of Queens and Smith with Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and its their grounding in this medium - so much more sympathetic to breezy comedy acting than film - that gives the first half of this flick its quick wit and freshness. Mendes tries gamely to keep up but its a tough call; supermodel Amber Valletta has a better time as Jamess unlikely sweetheart. Tennant loses tempo towards the end as he tries to shoehorn in sufficient rom to temper the com but by then weve seen enough from Smith to know he can - and will - milk this genre for all its worth.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Hitch | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hitch ) Hitch (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Hitch is a pleasant if slightly overlong romantic comedy from two men who have forged reputations in the genre. Director Andy Tennant is no stranger to love stories having previously helmed Fools Rush In Ever After and Sweet Home Alabama. And although Will Smith has had some success as an action hero and a dramatic leading man he is at his most appealing in this kind of movie when he makes us laugh and gets the girl. Hitch in underpinned by a simple premise which makes it a surprise that the running time comes close to two hours. The length is the films lone noticeable problem - snip about 20 minutes off of it and it would have been a breezy pleasure. (So much for the unwritten rule that no movie can sustain comic momentum for more than 90 minutesa|) But the expectation of third act romantic complications causes Kevin Bischs screenplay to bog down during its final 40 minutes and even the appeal and chemistry of the actors cant prevent Hitch from losing some of its load. Alex Hitchens (Smith) is a self-proclaimed ""date doctor."" His job is to help neer-do-wells in the dating game stop messing up so they can find true love. He identifies common mistakes suggests ""meet cutes"" and gives dancing and kissing lessons. Hitch follows the common motto of ""those who cant teach."" His own love life is a void. The knowledge he imparts is based on observation not experience. Hitch loved once and the pain from that experience has kept him from getting back in the saddle - until now. Enter gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes) who captures Hitchs attention from their first meeting. A series of disastrous dates does nothing to dissuade the couple from the realization that they might each have found ""the one"" in the other. Meanwhile Hitch has a new client - Albert (Kevin James) an overweight accountant who wants to woo the love of his life celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). The date doctor pulls off the seemingly impossible - teaching Albert how to get Allegra to notice him. But thats the easy part. The hard part is convincing Albert to relax enough so that Allegra wont be turned off on a date with a goofy guy who lacks self-confidence. If you think you know where Hitch is going youre probably right. Like most romantic comedies this one is light on surprises with predictability being considered an asset by many aficionados. Yet Hitch possesses something many entries into the genre lack a sense of humor. There are times when this movie is hilarious. Consider for example Hitch and Saras first date when a poorly placed leg maneuver causes them both to end up in the Hudson River. Then theres another assignation in which the discovery of a food allergy results in a mad dash through supermarket aisles in search of Benadril. Although theres sufficient chemistry between Smith and Eva Mendes and Kevin James and Amber Valleta to convince us that love is in the air the strongest pairing is that of Smith and James whose mentor/student relationship results in several of the films strongest scenes. The buddy moments offer a nice counterbalance to the potentially saccharine romantic interludes avoiding the ""all hearts and flowers"" trap that occasionally causes seizures by male members of the audience who show up to impress a date. Hitch is 2005s lone legitimate contender for a Valentines Day movie date. (I will ignore the existence of the dismal The Wedding Date - hopefully movie-goers will follow suit.) Couples will find this to be a pleasant way to spend an evening. Not only does it follow the expected trajectory of Cupids arrow by piercing the heart but it brushes against the funny bone as well. Even though a little less Hitch might have been a better thing the Fresh Prince keeps the proceedings from becoming too stale.

Starring Will Smith Eva Mendes Kevin James Amber Valletta. Directed by Andy Tennant. Written by Kevin Bisch. (PG-13. At Bay Area theaters). Will Smith cemented himself as the coolest guy in movies several years ago. But he never made a romantic comedy before ""Hitch"" and the pictures first scenes show how this might have happened. Rendered in small perfect doses between fights with aliens and robots his self-assured quips work wonders. As the meat of a movie they threaten to be overkill. Then ""Hitch"" does something unexpected. It takes Smiths borderline-smug persona and turns it on its ear. In fact the less in control Smith and his co- stars Eva Mendes and Kevin James appear the better ""Hitch"" becomes until its rather delightful. Its a big glossy romantic comedy with great New York apartments beautiful people and dorky behavior. Director Andy Tennant and screenwriter Kevin Bisch establish a breezy tone and offer up a New York that exists only in the movies in the best most escapist sense. The streets are spotless taxis come when you want them and men are so concerned with romance that they hire Smiths Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens as counsel. Hes a ""date doctor"" who might arrange for a womans dog to be temporarily lost then ""rescued"" by an admirer. Mostly he gives these guys confidence assuring them that women will see their goodness by the third date. Its a rather sweet concept. His biggest challenge is Albert (Kevin James) an accountant infatuated with a celebutante played by former model Amber Valletta. This romantic pairing would seem to require a tripling of the suspension of disbelief it takes to buy Leah Remini as the burly James wife on ""The King of Queens."" But deft scripting and James ingratiating performance keep it safely within the realm of romantic-comedy fantasy. This is a couple a little less believable than say Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen in ""Sideways"" but more believable than Woody Allen and the young Amazons he favors. Albert isnt deluded. Hes just certain hes the best man for this young woman even if her presence sends him scrambling for his asthma inhaler. Scenes where Hitch coaches Albert showcase the pictures best trait which is that it doesnt telegraph where its headed. When Albert whose firm handles the young heiress finances speaks up in a board meeting to impress her he cant stop speaking up until he loudly quits the company and storms off forcing Hitch to save the day Cyrano de Bergerac-style. Thats not how Hitch planned it and suddenly things are going awry for him as well. The date doctor is also a commitment-phobe and he must humble himself to heal himself. His opening bar banter with Mendes character a tenacious gossip columnist also averse to romance works because she loves words as much as he does. Smith an actor of great affability but also considerable remove could do this scene in his sleep. The fun happens when the couple go on a few bad dates ruffling Hitch and forcing Smith to show vulnerability. Their first date ends with Smith sweaty and looking lost his shirt stuck in a cab door. On another disastrous outing Hitch experiences a physical reaction that manifests itself in a manner thats hilarious and for a matinee idol like Smith nothing short of brave. Mendes from ""Out of Time"" and ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is a great physical fit for Smith who despite his handsomeness has never exuded a lot of sex appeal. When she is nestled under his arm he lacks any self-consciousness. Like Smith Mendes forfeits her vanity in a few scenes especially in one that forces her to cry in a very odd way. She brings great passion to a scene where she hurls broccoli and cauliflower. ""Hitch"" is too long by half an hour and as the comedy thins out the movie sells out her character by having her do something quite mean. But its impossible to dislike a lady who wields crudites as a weapon. ""Hitch"" has served up a duo we didnt know we were missing well-drawn sharp gorgeous characters of color in a big-budget romantic comedy. These are parts that usually go to Jim Carrey and Sandra Bullock but this time they didnt because Smith has enough clout to get a movie like this made. If five Oscar nominations for black actors represents a breakthrough than so does ""Hitch."" The most satisfying part is that the movies so good. -- Advisory This film contains profanity sexual references.

Yes the late great lummoxes John Candy and Chris Farley were incandescent talents who turned crummy movies into guilty-pleasure cable faves. Cedric the Entertainer usually kills with his chubby cool-cat act. And Jack Black certainly isnt afraid to go with his gut. Will Smith stars as matchmaker Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens who tries to help chubby Albert (Kevin James) make the right moves on a willowy heiress.

A former standup comic best known for the TV sitcom ""The King of Queens"" James is not the puckish scamp Belushi was -- the frisky eyebrows the happy feet the fearlessness. Instead hes the gentle but frustrated Everydope glooping mustard on his shirt flop-sweating before a first kiss glooping mustard on his pants. Hes desperate to shed his own skin and watching him try to do so -- his nervous line delivery is as potent as his pratfalls -- hurts so good. Of course if youve seen the posters and trailers for ""Hitch"" you know this is first and foremost A Will Smith Movie. Hmm you ask Isnt it a bad sign that the box-office stud of the summer season is dropping a flick into the dead cinema sea of February? The movie does get off to an ominous start with Smith talking to the camera and simplifying the female psyche for would-be suitors -- ""No guile no game no girl."" ""Hitch"" initially looks like a remake of the remake of ""Alfie"" which as the five people who saw it last year can attest was stinky. Plus ""Hitch"" is built on such ridiculous coincidences its as if New York has a population of about 14 and these folks just keep getting in each others way. And it takes way too long to get Jamess Albert Brennaman into the action; once he shows up youll be afraid to dash to the concession stand for fear of missing a minute of him. But Smith as a professional smoothie whose wooing tips are in high demand from the love losers of New York eventually helps James make ""Hitch"" a keeper. He ditches the slimy slickster routine and proves himself a commercially savvy star unafraid of mocking himself. After all he couldnt let James get all the laughs. Smiths Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens scarred from a past dumping and thus a commitment-phobe gets his comeuppance when he falls for a curvaceous gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) who makes him lose his mojo. On their first date he accidentally kicks her in the face. On their second date he has an allergic reaction to dinner and puffs up for some grotesque but great slapstick. The pretty Smith and the prettier Mendes have a definite chemistry -- as brother and sister perhaps. Theyre chummy giggly natural. You like them but you just never believe they have the hots for each other especially when director Andy Tennant (""Sweet Home Alabama"") forgets hes making a comedy and strives for lumpy weepy drama in the final act. You can probably guess the plot turns just from the obvious clues gossip columnist secret date doctor sweet fat guy aloof heiress. It gets all tangled and untangled hearts are broken hearts are healed. But forget about the predictable twists ""Hitch"" works best when its a buddy comedy with Smith and James having a blast as smooth Yoda and jiggly Jedi. The movies sparkling centerpiece is an alternating montage of Hitch training Albert for his first date with Vallettas little rich girl and then the big man and his lady love out on their first date which is not the expected disaster but is funny nonetheless. In previews for the movie Smiths reaction to Jamess zany dance moves is the tired ol black guy-white guy shtick ""Dont ever do that again."" The real punch line though is Jamess earnest stuttered response of ""I was just trying to express myself."" Trust me it kills. Tennant lets the serious denouement go on and on but give him credit for tacking on a jubilant coda that takes place at a wedding when the characters get down in a dance-off to Heavy Ds ""Now That Weve Found Love."" If you still dont believe a guy like James could get a gal like Valletta you will once you see them doing the robot together. Score one for the big boys. Hitch (114 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some obscenity and sexual situations.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Well-matched stars revisit the romantic comedy in HitchBy Mike Clark USA TODAY ""Hitch"" in movie parlance means Alfred Hitchcock but not when its Will Smith brandishing the moniker. As Hollywoods most acceptable date movie in a while the affable Hitch may have its surprises but Smiths casting isnt among them. This is a good fit. Student and teacher Kevin James left plays a nerd in desperate need of some lessons in loving from the romance expert Will Smith. Columbia Pictures It is surprising to see Smith who is all over the played-to-death coming attraction as just the central player in a full ensemble that includes relatively fresh faces coming through in sizable roles. Not a bad idea either because Smiths standard screen persona tends to be heavily concentrated. Sometimes you want to add a can of water and stir. Yet who better to play a New York ""date doctor"" who apparently makes good money (his apartment is no hovel) instructing predominantly love-hungry male dweebs that Altoids are their friends? A kind of urban legend whose identity is obscure to the general public Hitch also offers tutelage on the subtleties of romantic body language. In particular need of this is his client (The King of Queens Kevin James arguably stealing the film) a junior exec who has fallen for a supposedly unapproachable heiress (Amber Valletta). Sometimes literally so. Clouseau-like in his grace and sporting white socks with dark shoes a la vintage Jerry Lewis James doughy Albert would seem to be a lost cause. But during the course of an unlikely courtship he turns out to display the kind of bedrock character a gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) assumes Alberts famously glib teacher cant possibly share. About the movie Hitch    (out of four) Stars Will Smith Eva Mendes Kevin James Amber Valletta Julie Ann Emery Directors Andrew Tennant Distributor Columbia Rated PG-13 for language and some strong sexual references Opens Friday nationwide This is the rest of the movie Mendes much hit-upon tabloid snoop tries to trace and identify Manhattans most elusive smoothie phantom -- oblivious in standard romantic comedy fashion that she has just started to date him. For much of its length the premise seems less wilted than youd guess. This is because for one thing Mendes gives as good as she gets when bandying with Smith in her best screen role to date. Director Andy Tennant is actor-friendly throughout giving his performers (including a sweet turn by Julie Ann Emery as Mendes best friend) a chance to breathe in their roles. The downside of all this respiration is a two-hour running time and some unfortunate sluggishness near the end before an unexpected rally because of the most exuberant end-credits sequence in a while. Hitch is the second movie in two weeks (atop The Wedding Date) to end with the cast principals dancing at a reception. As movie trends go this one has its appeal as long as Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise dont reprise it for War of the Worlds.

"Hitch Turns On the Charm washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Hitch Turns On the Charm Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 11 2005 SOMETIMES big-time studio entertainment is done so well you simply have to salute its corporate effectiveness. Besides you could do a lot worse than enjoy ""Hitch"" a romantic comedy starring Will Smith Eva Mendes and the gymnastically funny Kevin James. Smith plays Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens a love affair consultant in New York City who works very discreetly. He takes on personal referrals only. Hitch believes that no object of desire is too impossible. Case in point His newest student the fire-hydrant-shaped Albert (James) an accountant who is desperate to get romantic with his glamorous celebrity-client Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Albert cant eat lunch without wearing it. If he had a neck as a boy hes certainly lost it now. Yet he dares to hope. Hitch -- a sort of Budweiser-era version of the Vicomte de Valmont from ""Dangerous Liaisons"" -- likes that spirit. He agrees to train the big guy. Hitchs way of life is threatened when he meets Sara Melas (Mendes) a beautiful hardworking gossip writer. Like him shes romantically jaded. If Hitch knows every line available to the working lothario shes heard them all. Theyre a big matchup waiting to happen if either of them cared to engage. Turns out they both do. Stop me when you havent heard pure formula. But thats precisely the mission from Smiths machine-gun repartee to Jamess high-energy slapstick. Its as familiar as it is spit-polished. Smith his comedic instincts honed to perfection from years of sitcom boot camp and such hits as ""Men in Black"" makes a smooth roguish charmer. And Mendes a sensual force of nature makes his perfect sparring partner. But its James who earns the greatest commendation. He literally works himself into a sweat to steal every scene. Theres nobody who wants your laughter more than this guy. Imagine a linebacker trained by the Bolshoi Ballet; thats James. (Watch him on the dance floor and youll see what I mean.) Hes bullishly elegant and way before the end of this movie youre convinced Allegra could find no better man. Thats the charm of ""Hitch."" You know whats being fed to you and yet you slurp it down just the same. HITCH (PG-13 114 minutes) -- Contains some obscenity and sexual situations. Area theaters.
