"Anacondas Oh Boa What Fun washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Anacondas Oh Boa What Fun Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 27 2004 The cast members of ""Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid"" are so lean tight and cute they look more like theyre on a shoot for a J. Crew catalogue than a giant snake movie. But the movie itself turns out to be pretty lean tight and cute Its one of those ""I-cant-believe-Im-enjoying-this"" kind of things a throwback to the old jungle adventure staples of the 30s happily tossing in cliches (parrots and monkey sidekicks headhunters and poison spiders) that havent been tossed in for years and all without a whisper of irony. Okay so theyve added 50-foot-long snakes -- whats the big deal? Trimly directed by Dwight Little as if he were channeling the spirit of great 40s directors such as Michael Curtiz and Raoul Walsh the movie tells of an expedition up a lazy lazy river in Borneo in search of an orchid whose pharmaceutical properties may extend life thus making whoever happens to possess it a billionaire. So a big pharm corporation sponsors a trip in search of the flower. To go on this hyper-scientific trip by the way you must have a PhD an MD and a 24-inch waist. Hard specs to find I know but the casting director does a good job. Johnny Messner plays the scruffy sexy tattooed captain and though I didnt recognize the name the guy seemed vaguely familiar. Oh yeah thanks to the Internet Movie Database I learned hed been one of the SEALs in last years underrated ""Tears of the Sun."" Hes got cheekbones like billiard balls and eyes like ball bearings and he keeps finding ways to take that shirt off and show us how ripped he is. Hes Michael Phelps with a three-day beard. Plus a monkey sits on his shoulder Is this a star turn or what? He ferries the others into jungleland aboard a creaky old steamer that looks like the thing the cast ran aground in on ""Gilligans Island"" helped by his pal and second mate the Jason Scott Lee look-alike Karl Yune. In fact after Messner nearly everyone else in the cast seems to be a clone Salli Richardson the team administrator is a dead ringer for Pam Grier; thin blond babe KaDee Strickland looks like Tea Leoni Kathryn Morris or Naomi Watts take your pick; Matthew Marsden looks like Kyle Secor; and so forth and so on. All right Morris Chestnut looks like Morris Chestnut and nobody else -- you have me there. The plot is typical tigers snakes triple-canopy jungle boat wrecks waterfalls more snakes a traitor in their midst in more or less random order. The big snake orgy is new Give them some credit even if the anacondas are digital constructs added by some geek toiling over a hot hard drive. Still as movie illusions go theyre pretty scary being big and fast at once. But they have no superpowers Theyre just big hungry eating machines and they die as easily as any other snake. The movie I should add seems to have very little in common with the ""original"" if such a word may be used of 1997. Its really not a sequel in any sense but just another darn anaconda movie Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 but feels very close to an R for the violence it depicts.

Starring Morris Chestnut Johnny Messner Matthew Marsden. Directed by Dwight Little. Written by John Claflin Daniel Zelman Michael Miner Ed Neumeier Hans Bauer Jim Cash Jack Epps Jr. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Seven screenwriters toiled on ""Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid "" a sequel to the 1997 horror hit ""Anaconda."" They emerged with a plot eerily similar to that of the original Greed sends a jungle expedition literally into the belly of the beast. Maybe this couldnt be helped. How many anaconda stories are there really? ""Anacondas Snakes in Paris"" would have been pretentious. The sequel might have the formula down but it lacks everything that made ""Anaconda"" fun. Instead of Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube we get Morris Chestnut as headliner. A handsome capable actor Chestnut is no Ice Cube and hes certainly no J.Lo. The role of human-snake-in-the-grass also has been watered down considerably. The ""Blood Orchid"" evildoer (Matthew Marsden) is a pipsqueak compared with Jon Voights snake hunter. Voight knew that a movie about an anaconda needed a big performance. ""Blood Orchid"" does improve on the hokey special effects in ""Anaconda"" which is an upgrade akin to putting shiny chrome wheels on a rusted-out Pinto. The relative technical proficiency only serves to highlight the movies terrible dialogue and ridiculous situations. The titular flower is supposed to contain a youth serum. Looking to bottle and sell it Chestnuts junior captain of industry and a team of scientists head to Borneo hiring a broken-down barge to take them down a murky river filled with ... well its not clown fish. Captaining the boat is a gritty whiskey-soaked American expat played with an utter lack of humor by Johnny Messner. The captain shows his machismo by fending off a crocodile prompting a shipmate to remark ""That is either the bravest or the craziest thing I have ever seen."" That is either the pithiest or the most overused line in cinema. Cameo appearances by the croc a paralyzing spider and a barge-destroying waterfall remind us that anacondas are not the only dangers lurking in the jungle and its brownish tributaries. Its probably just happenstance that every moment without an anaconda also saved on the budget. There is a scary early scene involving a snake and a tiny pet monkey along with some unsettling shots of what appear to be real anacondas snaking through the water. But it takes too long for the snakes to start thinning out the human crew. The movies anacondas have some flaws most notably a tendency to crush peoples bones but they cannot be accused of elitism. The first human to become snake food is not just the best-looking member of the group but also a doctor. Then things get stupid. The lead scientist made mildly oily by Marsden insists the crew forge on toward the orchid and his show of avarice leads to more lethal encounters. Any appreciation of these action scenes is tempered by the knowledge of how easily the situations could have been avoided. Since everyone in the film appears to be 28 years old and most of them hardier than the scientist somebody should have kicked the geeks butt and been done with it. This is the summer for movies about people stranded in water which sparks an idea for a thematic party a few months down the road when the pictures are out on DVD.

Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/anacondas-the-hunt-for-the-blood-orchid-2004,200,anacondasthehuntforthebloodorchid10,anacondasthehuntforthebloodorchid,rogerebert
"Life has been squeezed out of `Anacondas - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Life has been squeezed out of `Anacondas By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 27 2004 Oh anaconda The last time we heard from that sweaty jungle snake it was trying to have its way with Ice Cube Eric Stoltz Owen Wilson Kari Wuhrer Danny Trejo and a pre-diva J. Lo back in the spring of 1997. Mmmm boy the movie was tasty and Im sure the people the snake could catch tasted really good too especially nutty Jon Voight who was scarier than the snake and probably had a flavor reminiscent of a boiled ham.Yes ""Anaconda"" was enjoyable garbage about a National Geographic film crew and the snake that ate it. They were led down the Amazon by Voights crazy Paraguayan anacondaholic who was the mutant offspring of Robert Shaw in ""Jaws"" Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now"" and a lot of Wild Turkey. As was the movie.You might notice I havent said a word about that movies successor ""Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid."" Theres nothing really wrong with it -- its bad but no worse than it needs to be which is the problem. Where the first movie had a fragrant odor the smell say of Lysol sprayed in a gas station bathroom ""Anacondas"" actually stinks. Here a bunch of scientists and venture capitalists head to Borneo to snatch up the precious blood orchid which happens to contain a ""chemical that can significantly prolong cellular life."" With the flower these arrogant young punks stand to make a fortune. Without it its presumably back to temping or to the greeter spot at Anthropolo-gie. In Borneo the gang of four men and two women hire someone to take them through the swamp and the seasonal torrential downpours to the flower which blooms for only a few weeks every seven years. (Like ""Anaconda"" sequels?) Predictably the tumbledown boat meets its end over a waterfall leaving the gang likely to be mauled by one of the dozens of snakes in town to mate. Thats right Theyre huge theyre hungry theyre horny.""Anacondas"" directed by Dwight H. Little follows the trend of turning horror movies into game shows and obstacle courses. Accordingly most of the cast members including Morris Chestnut and Salli Richardson- Whitfield look like personal trainers and our muscled riverboat king (Johnny Messner) makes a fine fitness director. Someone even remarks that hiking in the jungle is like ""doing the Stair-Master in a sauna."" The movie lacks a Jon Voight or an Owen Wilson or even a fun ditz like Kari Wuhrer. Instead we get this bunch of studs and hotties -- some whites and blacks one Latin and an Asian; theyre not a cast so much as the racial equivalent of snake-baiting trail mix. And look out for the Brit whose accent is so dastardly theres no way its real. Other than Eugene Byrd who steals the movie as a nerdy normal-looking technician these folks are so money-grubbing vain and unsympathetic that its surprisingly easy to root for the snakes. Bon appetit boys. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Lo this time no Ice Cube no Jon Voight no Owen Wilson. What the belated follow-up to 1997s eponymous hit does have Chestnut suffering a 151-proof spider bite. Plus some neat overhead shots of huge slinky slinkers slinking through sinister waters as a no-name but hard-working cast remains oblivious though not for long. (Related item Watch the trailer) After a jungle prologue packed with portent we cut to that well-known Mecca for anacondas the Manhattan boardroom. Morris Chestnut and others spearhead a Borneo trip to find the rare title plant an alleged fountain of youth. Its a rude surprise to these encroachers -- but not to us because weve noted the plural in the title -- to learn that there are multiple serpents around because its mating season and the snakes (like aphrodisiac-seeking hippies) have been munching the plants. At least director Dwight Little (Free Willy 2) gives us enough B-movie speed to keep Orchid from becoming a fountain of aging. (PG-13 action violence scary images some language) Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2  star out of four Heres a late-August dog-days atrocity from the ""arent farts funny?"" school of filmmaking. Its a sequel to 1999s Baby Geniuses a slam-dunk pick for one of the worst comedies ever. (Related item Watch the trailer) Jon Voight who looked more comfortable being regurgitated in the first Anaconda plays a central-casting German bringing a heavy hand to his plot to infiltrate youngsters minds with televised brain-rot carried by his satellite network. Yet what can he do against toddlers with verbal skills -- to say nothing of a cast of vapid teenagers? And as long as the movie is taking a stand against brain-rot what about dialogue like ""Hey prissy pants dont wet yourself"" and ""For the last time whats a kahuna?"" Scott Baio is saddled with the last comment and you have to believe that even his agent is waking up this morning with a dead fish in his mailbox.

Thats because ""Anacondas"" embraces its identity. It knows its nothing more than an instantly forgettable thriller destined to be dumped into Hollywoods late August compost heap so it figures it may as well have some fun before making the quick trip to DVD. The stars of ""Anaconda"" -- Jennifer Lopez Ice Cube and Jon Voight who was clearly busy working on the much meatier sequel ""Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2"" -- are notably absent from this follow-up. The only instantly recognizable face is Morris Chestnuts (""The Best Man""). He plays one member of a scientific group that heads to Borneo in search of an extremely rare orchid that blooms for just one week. If retrieved and brought back to the United States the orchid could be used to create the pharmaceutical equivalent of the fountain of youth. But before our scientists can feel the flowers power theyll have to confront massive human-consuming anacondas. Thats how you know this movie is scarier than the original. This time the titles plural. _____More in Movies_____  Anacondas Details  Watch the Trailer  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert You dont have to be Paula Abdul to know these are coldhearted snakes and they dont play by rules. But the reptiles arent the only objects of terror; ""Anacondas"" also features crocodiles bloodsucking leeches and spiders that can paralyze humans with a single bite. Once this movies momentum gets going watching it is like experiencing a schlocky monster movie ""Lord of the Flies"" and Peter Gabriels ""Shock the Monkey"" video all at once. But unlike the J. Lo version ""Anacondas"" uses more convincing special effects doesnt take itself too seriously and provides much-needed comic relief in the form of Eugene Byrd who plays the perpetually freaked-out Cole. ""So youre telling me theres some snake orgy out in the jungle?"" he screams at one point. Thats right Cole. Welcome to the ""Anacondas"" jungle. Its got fun and games.

Could squeeze a couple of solid weeks from genre and urban auds before slithering on to even stronger homevid/DVD biz. Not unlike the exotic flower its heroes seek ""Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid"" is something of a jewel among grade-Z entertainments. Sublimely trashy this conceptual sequel to 1997s surprise hit ""Anaconda"" doesnt expect to be taken any more seriously than its schlock predecessor (which starred the then-relatively unknown Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson) and keeps its tongue-in-cheek thrills flowing rapidly. While late-summer opening may prevent B.O. from reaching original pics robust 65 million ""Anacondas"" could squeeze a couple of solid weeks from genre and urban auds before slithering on to even stronger homevid/DVD biz. Though it reprises no characters from ""Anaconda"" new pic tells a similar story of jungle adventurers journeying upriver into a venomous heart of darkness. As before Joseph Conrad neednt feel threatened. Whereas prior pic focused on anthropological filmmakers searching for a lost Amazonian tribe this time a quintet of scientists (who natch look more like pin-ups) is dispatched to Borneo by a major New York pharmaceuticals corporation. Group includes egotistical team leader Jack (Matthew Marsden); his nubile female assistant (and former pupil) Sam (KaDee Strickland); competitive doubting Thomas Gail (Salli Richardson-Whitfield); money man Gordon (Morris Chestnut); and computer geek Cole (Eugene Byrd) whose real specialty is providing comic relief. Also along is a libidinous young doctor (Nicholas Gonzalez) who can scarcely conceal his attraction to Sam. The teams collective goal is to harvest a rare breed of orchid that may be capable of prolonging life. If that is true the find could turn them all into overnight billionaires. Of course ""Anacondas"" is no more a movie about orchids than was ""Adaptation."" and so its only a matter of time before pics intrepid explorers become live bait for an eponymous army of man-eating snakes. Arriving in Indonesia at the height of the rainy season the researchers find only one guy in town crazy enough to ferry them where they want to go -- an American ex-special forces operative named Johnson (Johnny Messner) who has shoulders the size of bread loaves and one of those grizzled square-jawed demeanors that says he eats nails for breakfast. Out on the water Johnsons boat (a ramshackle heap that makes the African Queen seem a model of seaworthiness) stalls and in a Herzog-esque sequence plummets over a dramatic waterfall. Forced to hike through dense jungle brush in search of help (and amazingly still in search of the blood orchid) the explorers find themselves deep inside the Anacondas lair and about to discover that -- uh oh -- its mating season. Make no mistake ""Anacondas"" is never more than a parade of cliches strung together by some seven credited writers (including the late Jim Cash who died four years ago). But pic works consistently on the level of Corman-esque popcorn entertainment thanks to the efficiency energy and lightness of touch of helmer Dwight Little (""Halloween 4"" ""Marked for Death"") and his game cast. From a wrestling match between Johnson and an animatronic crocodile to the sophomoric sexual innuendo pic constantly winks and nods at the audience. Yet it also manages to deliver its fair share of armrest-gripping jolts particularly in the snake-attack sequences which frequently surprise with their brutal speed and fury. As pic progresses toward its climactic showdown between men and beast it has great fun toying with the notion that these super-snakes may actually be a good deal more clever than the greedy fortune hunters. Shot in Fiji on a modest budget pics production values are reasonably muscular with crisp spacious widescreen lensing by Australian cinematographer Stephen F. Windon (save for a few conspicuously underlit shots at pics climax). CG work is well integrated with pics physical special effects while some special mention must go to a very well-trained tree monkey named Kong who steals just about every scene hes in.

Lo. But theres no enjoyably outlandish hiss to this variation on the formula and no Ice Cube or Owen Wilson either. This time a ship of capitalist fools (and no movie stars unless you count utility player Morris Chestnut as a headliner) steams along the river in Borneo - theyre pharmaceutical researchers who see dollar signs among the title flora. But as the players squabble and shriek their way to safety (or gory death) connoisseurs of fake-snake formula movies may find themselves pining for the guest-star wackiness provided in the original by Jon Voight. Those purists are encouraged to enliven their Anacondas experience by placing friendly wagers on whos expendable and in what order.
