By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor September 27 2008 Save for later Saved Matteo Sciabordi Omar Benson Miller Michael Ealy Derek Luke and Laz Alonso are shown in a scene from Miracle at St. Anna. David Lee/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Precious few films have dealt even tangentially with the stories of black American soldiers in World War II which is why Spike Lees ""Miracle at St. Anna"" is doubly disappointing. Clocking in at 160 minutes this interminable movie comes across like a rough cut. Perhaps Lee believed its length would give it gravitas. The opposite is true.What Lee and screenwriter James McBride adapting his novel have essentially done is graft every World War II movie cliche featuring nonblacks onto a movie about the so-called Buffalo Soldiers the all-black 92nd Infantry division of the segregated US Army. In the standard World War II movie - ""A Walk in the Sun"" is the template - we follow a platoon of diverse soldiers as they wisecrack their way across the battlefield. The Italian the Pole the Roman Catholic the Jew the bookworm the ladies man the coward the hero the rube the city slicker - they all get their time in the sun.In ""Miracle at St. Anna"" which is mainly set in 1944 four members of the infantry are trapped behind enemy lines in Tuscany the upright 2nd Staff Sgt. Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke); the randy gold-toothed Sgt. Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy); the hulking childlike Pfc. Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller); and Corp. Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) who we first see in the films framing device 40 years hence as a postal worker who inexplicably shoots a man who comes to his window. The wartime flashback from this incident is supposed to explain his actions although this fact is quickly forgotten since Hector is easily the least interesting of the quartet. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Each man is a stand-in for a particular racial prototype. Aubrey for example is an honorable citizen who believes in working within society; Bishop is an oversexed hound dog who makes a beeline for an attractive Tuscan local (Valentina Cervi); Sam nicknamed the ""chocolate giant"" is such a hayseed that he seems stunted. Hes a bit like Lenny in ""Of Mice and Men."" In the films most egregious and annoying bit of hankie-waving Sam rescues a shellshocked 7-year-old boy (Matteo Sciabordi) and guards him come what may. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Miracle at St. Anna If anybody but Lee had made this movie the portrayal of these men - of Sam in particular - would have invited charges of racial stereotyping. Equally stereotypical is the portrayal of the few white soldiers whom we see particularly the white racist officers who refer to the men as ""Eleanor Roosevelts niggers."" Werent there a few white military men who cringed at the segregation they were enforcing?The early battle sequences are nothing much but theyre far better than the static talky scenes where the men holed up in a village connect with local partisans. Boredom seems a greater threat than bullets. Lee must be aware of this because at every opportunity he layers Terence Blanchards lushly bland music onto the soundtrack as a diversion.Lee owes a great debt to everything from ""Saving Private Ryan"" to Roberto Rossellinis ""Paisan"" but the didacticism of ""Miracle of St. Anna"" is all his own. His motto might be Dont dramatize a message tell it. And so one of the soldiers tells us ""I love Italy. I aint a nigger here."" To take another example we are presented with an entirely gratuitous and poorly staged flashback-within-a-flashback showing German prisoners eating in a Southern diner barred to the black soldiers. Does this 160-minute movie really need this digression complete with retaliatory payback in order to point up the obvious? Must we be taught that racism exists?Lees previous movie ""Inside Man"" was a swift and reasonably entertaining crime thriller that was also his most commercially lucrative film ever. Its success suggested that Lee despite the pander and bluster of his reputation was best at making genre movies unencumbered by ideology. (Hes also an excellent documentarian.) But Lee is back to his old form in ""Miracle in St. Anna"" which for the most part plays up all that is bad about him as a filmmaker and adds a few new mediocre touches as well like the religiosity that descends upon the movie in its final moments with all the spirituality of a Hallmark greeting card.Whatever miracle occurred at St. Anna never made it to the screen. Grade C- (Rated R for strong war violence language and some sexual content and nudity.)

Yet the real subject is the unsung heroism of black American soldiers during World War II. Given the importance of that subject the real mystery of Mr. Lees movie is why its so diffuse dispirited emotionally distanced and dramatically inert. ENLARGE Matteo Sciabordi (left) and Laz Alonso in Miracle at St. Anna. Touchstone Pictures The most obvious clue lies in the punishing running time -- more than 160 minutes plus an end-title crawl. The screenplay was adapted by James McBride from his own novel and he and his director must have wanted to mine every page in their pursuit of epic sweep. The main story set in Tuscany in 1944 during the Italian campaign centers on four infantrymen of the all-black 92nd Division Buffalo Soldiers. After one soldier risks his life to save a traumatized Italian boy all of them become trapped behind enemy lines where their immediate salvation depends on partisans and villagers of indeterminate loyalties. (And where the narrative slows to a crawl for tedious mostly subtitled digressions on the intricacies of partisan politics. All thats missing is a ghostly turn by Anna Magnani or Raf Vallone.) ""Miracle at St. Anna"" contains plenty of material for a couple of other films -- a terrible massacre of Tuscan civilians by Nazi troops and the ostensibly mystical but eventually mawkish relationship between the little boy and his G.I. savior Sam Train a saintly giant of a man played by Omar Benson Miller. Whats more those events of the now-distant past are set off by a plot-heavy framing device that starts with a postal clerk committing a seemingly inexplicable murder in Harlem in the early 1980s and ends in the Bahamas with a toxic dose of ersatz uplift. See a clip of Spike Lees new movie ""Miracle of St. Anna."" The surfeit of elements and themes cant explain the indifferent craftsmanship. Spike Lee has made some brilliant films in the course of his prolific career; he also directed an intricate and terrific commercial thriller ""Inside Man"" that was released only last year. Yet his storytelling this time is fragmented to the point of incoherence. The score by Terence Blanchard is relentlessly elegiac. The battle scenes are long on explosion and short on invention. The performances are stolid and unexceptional apart from Mr. Millers few touching moments and a stylish cameo by Alexandra Maria Lara as the Nazi propagandist Axis Sally. If the lapses are disappointing the sense of missed opportunity is dismaying. In most of the Hollywood war movies made during and long after World War II American fighting men were almost always white. The role that black troops actually played is an important story and might have been a powerful one in Spike Lees hands. Indeed a sense of that power can still be gleaned from the DVD version of Rachid Boucharebs ""Days of Glory"" a magnificent French-language film that played here two years ago and told essentially the same story with different skin shades -- four Algerian soldiers in the French army fighting bravely against the Nazis for the nation they love while their fellow French soldiers treat them like scum and their casually despicable racist officers use them as cannon fodder. But the Bouchareb film allowed the awful ironies of the situation to speak for themselves while Spike Lee keeps hammering them home with agitprop fervor and clumsy actors playing racist officers as crude cartoons. The irony of the production as a whole is that an impassioned filmmaker with a strong tale to tell has managed to lose track of it. Instead of staying close to the troops and their travails the film wanders through wartime Tuscany like an addled tourist mesmerized by village life and eager for miracles. Nights in Rodanthe ""Nights in Rodanthe"" is nothing if not timely -- a movie with a hurricane sequence opening in the hurricane season. Its also timely in the sense that it opens like scores of other movies in recent years with an alarm clock going off. Among its additional attractions are an elusive band of wild horses that shows up for a symbolic gallop on a beach and a bathroom scene that eschews toilet humor -- the joke turns on bad plumbing in the sink. Yet this sodden romance which was directed by George C. Wolfe in his feature debut is less than the sum of its parts which were problematic to begin with. ENLARGE Diane Lane and Richard Gere in Nights in Rodanthe. Warner Bros. Its only distinction as well as its primary source of dashed hopes is the casting of Richard Gere and Diane Lane reunited at last after playing husband and wife six years ago in ""Unfaithful"" a quite remarkable romance that promised prosaic formula but delivered genuine passion. In this one they play strangers -- she is Adrienne an unhappily married mom and he is Paul a surgeon struggling with a tragedy -- who become lovers at an otherwise empty hotel on North Carolinas Outer Banks. Im sorry if you think Im giving away a big plot point but what else would they become with no one else around and a whole movie to fill? The sad truth about ""Nights in Rodanthe"" is that it never does get filled even though the running time is only 97 minutes and some of those minutes are taken up by the hurricane which sounds like the D-Day invasion. (Another chunk of time when Adrienne and Paul are still lovers-to-be is devoted to them playing kitchen basketball by tossing canned goods in a garbage can.) The movies twin problems at least until the denouement are predictability and underpopulation. Its basically a two-character play and though the director is celebrated for his groundbreaking work in live theater he hasnt saved his stars from the cameras pitiless gaze. Richard Gere suffers less than Diane Lane. He gets by with a mixture of skill and self-irony. She acts up a storm in every scene but you root for the hurricane. DVD TIP Nonfiction filmmaking doesnt get any better than Spike Lees feature-length documentary 4 Little Girls (1997). The children of the title died in the 1963 bombing of an African-American church in Birmingham Ala. Mr. Lees anguishingly beautiful film honors their lives through interviews with friends and family as well as the segregationist governor George C. Wallace and archival footage of such pillars of Southern racism as Birminghams commissioner of public safety Eugene ""Bull"" Connor. The film should be required seeing for anyone who wants to understand the roots of Americas civil rights movement.

Starring Derek Luke Laz Alonso Omar Benson Miller Michael Ealy Valentina Cervi and Matteo Sciabordi. Directed by Spike Lee. (Rated R. 160 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and movie times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) The impulse here is to say something about the nobility of this movies intent or to note that Spike Lee is one of our best filmmakers. But the first and most honest thing to say about ""Miracle at St. Anna"" is that its an awful mess. This takes awhile to realize thanks to the family resemblance that ""Miracle"" bears to Lees other better work. Lee has a gift for making even minor characters specific and for shading scenes in ways that lift out in special ways. In ""Miracle at St. Anna"" Lees hand is evident in all the details but he loses control of the overall structure. The movie caves in by the middle under the weight of multiple intents and conflicting impulses. ""Miracle at St. Anna"" is based on James McBrides novel of the same name. McBride also wrote the screenplay which is probably the biggest mistake Lee made. Perhaps it all hung together in the novel but the movie - about four GIs from a black soldiers unit in World War II - is told in episodic bursts without much narrative drive to sustain it from sequence to sequence. Lee tries to compensate by making the scenes and the characters vivid but all his flair and panache cant distract the audience from realizing that nothing much is happening - for 160 minutes. After a brief opening set in 1983 the movie flashes back to 1944 with the four soldiers stuck behind enemy lines in a small Tuscan village. Though the war is never far away the men have time (lots of it) to grow and have personal insights over the course of a few days. On the more fanciful side a mountainous private named Train (Omar Benson Miller) develops a fatherly bond with a beautiful little Italian boy (Matteo Sciabordi) who seems to have mystical powers. Meanwhile a staff sergeant (Derek Luke) and a sergeant (Michael Ealy) have their relationship damaged when they become attracted to the same beautiful woman (Valentina Cervi). Lees problem is not merely that there are two movies here but that these two strains are in conflict and undermine each other. On the one hand the film pulls in the direction of fable as seen through the eyes of the little boy promising a mix of horror magic and miracles similar to ""Pans Labyrinth."" On the other Lee does his best to make a realistic epic about the experience of black soldiers a kind of African American ""Saving Private Ryan."" Either approach might have been worthy. The scenes between the boy and the private (whom the boy calls in Italian his ""Chocolate Giant"") have a beauty and mystery to them. Likewise when the staff sergeant observes that he feels more at home and accepted in Italy than in his own country Lee begins to make a case for a realistic movie about the black GIs experience. But taken together the mix is disastrous. The straight drama keeps the fable element earthbound and the fable element keeps the drama crawling when it should be running. Even worse the film retains the extreme violence of a fable without the distance or accompanying wisdom a fable might use to soften the violence or put it into context. The unexpected result is that ""Miracle at St. Anna"" lands in a place Lee could never have wanted - in utter nihilism thinly covered by false sentiment. -- Advisory Simulated sex strong language and extreme scenes of combat and mass slaughter.

Miracle at St. Anna (R) Touchstone (166 min.) Directed by Spike Lee. With Derek Luke Michael Ealy. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS Spike Lee is an intelligent director. But he has never been a very smart filmmaker. A smart filmmaker -- a Steven Soderbergh say -- would find a nice profitable mindless all-star movie franchise that he could churn out with one eye closed. And then every so often hed round up that capital -- metaphoric and otherwise -- and use it to make something he really wanted. But Lee has always been too passionate for that. He jumps full-tilt into the movies that he not only wants to make but feels need to be made. And for a long time that resulted in pictures that -- from ""Summer of Sam"" to ""Bamboozled"" -- that were full of more prophecy than profit. And then he took a breath and made ""Inside Man"" and suddenly sold a lot of tickets again. You can call it giving in if you want or just growing up but it gave him the commercial cred to take an even bigger risk now -- an epic World War II movie about black soldiers in occupied Italy. Full of characters and spectacle and coming in at just a whisker over 23/4 hours its Lees own ""Saving Private Ryan."" But that comparison cuts both ways. Yes like Spielbergs breakthrough drama its full of patriotism passion and some startling gore. Using the same camera tricks and fast editing Lee paints a bloody battlefield panorama of severed limbs and screaming men and creates some harrowing movie moments. But like that Spielberg film -- and others -- ""Miracle"" doesnt quite know when to quit. It has a long framing device which only pads the running time and amps up the sentimentality. Precious minutes are spent slowly introducing characters we never see again. Tears are shamelessly tugged. Based on the novel by James McBride the heart of the story revolves around four African-American soldiers separated from their unit somewhere in Tuscany. One of them befriends and shelters a young Italian orphan; another tries to romance every bella female he sees. The other two concentrate on the task at hand staying alive and getting home. The four soldiers are well drawn particularly the ones played by Derek Luke and Michael Ealy. As the quietly dedicated and courageous staff sergeant Luke sees this war as a chance for all African-Americans to fight not just for Europes freedom but their own; as his sly lascivious sergeant Ealy sees it strictly as a selfish opportunity. Both actors are terrific as is John Turturro as a detective in the storys framing sequence. But one of the reasons theyre good is that the roles are too; McBride and Lee know these people. They dont know the German soldiers (who come off as a variety of Hollywood-movie types) or the Italian peasants (who seem to have wandered in from ""The Secret of Santa Vittoria""). Yet the film is very good when its just the black soldiers on screen talking. In one sharp based-on-fact sequence we see the homefront through their eyes as theyre denied the basic rights given even Nazi prisoners of war; in another they then turn those eyes on us and stare right through the lens in a signature moment of Lee confrontation. Ultimately the film falters -- due to its length some unconvincing European characters (here Im sure to help mollify the movies many European investors) and too many turns that depend on sudden supernatural intervention (I know its called ""Miracle at St. Anna"" but still). It risks a lot and not all of it pays off. But its exciting to see Lee still taking the gamble. And encouraging that by learning to hedge his bets a bit he seems likely to take an even bigger one another day. Rating note The film contains brief nudity strong language racial epithets and gory violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

While Lees intentions are noble - to portray the African-American soldiers he says were ignored in Eastwoods film - the merits of his own lumbering movie often get subverted by questionable artistic choices. ""St. Anna"" like the Eastwood movie and the far superior ""Saving Private Ryan"" bookends its 1940 story with scenes taking place closer to the present day - in this case the 1980s. The differences are that Lees framing device - which ends with a head-scratching fantasy - doesnt work. At. All. It opens with an elderly postal worker seen dismissing John Wayne in ""The Longest Day"" killing an elderly Italian in cold blood at the post office where he works with a service revolver he conveniently carries. That leaves detective John Turturro reporter Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the audience to ponder the mystery which involves a looted head of a marble statue from Rome that was improbably lugged around by four heroic members of a black platoon 40 years earlier. The four are survivors of a Nazi ambush (expertly staged by Lee) that a group of Buffalo Soldiers have been sent into by a cartoonishly racist white officer. They end up in a small Italian village with very divided political sympathies a sexy resistance fighter (Valentina Cervi) and a German deserter that the Allies very much want to question. The shy Sgt. Stamps (Derek Luke) develops a crush on the woman who is more aggressively wooed by the more suave Sgt. Cummings (Michael Ealy). The other two GIs are Cpl. Negron (Laz Alonso) a translator and the simple-minded Pfc. Train (Omar Benson Miller) who becomes fixated on an Italian orphan who refers to him as a ""chocolate giant"" in an episode that can only be described as neo-realism filtered through the sensibilities of Roberto Benigni. Sometimes Lee hits the nail on the head - theres a wonderful party scene where the Italians embrace their liberators so warmly that the GIs observe they feel more at home here than in America. Contrast that with a totally unsubtle flashback-within-a-flashback of the black soldiers being refused service at a redneck diner. Just in case we miss the point the diner is serving Caucasian German prisoners of war. And just in case we still dont get the point Lee ends the sequence with the actors staring directly into the camera - a jaccuse moment that takes the audience out of the movie altogether. All of these narrative tics bloat the running time past the 21/2-hour mark. The sad thing is theres a perfectly fine Sam Fulle-rish 90-minute war movie on a worthy subject trapped somewhere in the self-indulgences of ""Miracle at St. Anna."" MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA A losing battle. In English and Italian with English subtitles. Running time 160 minutes. Rated R (graphic war violence profanity sex nudity).

(LILO/SIPA) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday September 25 2008 1158 AM One has to wonder what Spike Lee would think if somebody else had made ""Miracle at St. Anna."" On the one hand hed presumably praise the motivations of a black filmmaker telling the still-unheard stories of black soldiers in World War II. On the other hed be hard-pressed to ignore the fact that those stories are too often stuck in a swamp of stereotypes and cliches. PHOTOS MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA PREMIERECertainly there are some powerful moments threaded throughout the film which is based on a novel by screenwriter James McBride. The movie opens in 1983 New York when aging postal worker Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) suddenly shoots an apparently innocent customer. Its up to a young Daily News reporter (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to figure out why.With some urging the man flashes back to 1944 when he and three others from the 92nd Infantry Division are left to fend for themselves. After a horrific battle kills their fellow soldiers the survivors find temporary haven in an Italian village. Aubrey (Derek Luke) and Hector try to pull things together while Bishop (Michael Ealy) flirts with their pretty host (Valentina Cervi) and Train (Omar Benson Miller) bonds with a wide-eyed orphan (Matteo Sciabordi). There is a traitor among them but they face countless other dangers as well.Lee takes nearly three hours to tell this sad tale but he never makes the most of the opportunity. The characters are far too familiar - especially the slow-witted Train - and the script overly sentimentalized. Lees passion is as always palpable. But it often seems as though hes hamstrung by a host of frustrations. Does he worry that subtlety will pass us by? That we need to be spoken down to or manipulated into caring? He even spells out the movies objective for us at the start when Hector watches the white soldiers in a John Wayne movie and angrily announces ""We fought that war too."" Of course the experiences and sacrifices of black troops which were so often overlooked should be represented and honored. But because Lee underestimates our desire to do so the movie that follows doesnt do them justice.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

I found myself pondering why the filmmakers chose to dramatize certain scenes that could have been condensed to a few lines of dialogue and why they missed the opportunity to show us some pivotal episodes in the tale. I couldnt get a handle on the scope of the film too ambitious at 160 minutes but too modest in scale to be an epic. And yet I found myself happily carried along from its red-herring opening to its implausible tearjerking conclusion. This is a 90-foot all-you-can-eat buffet table of a film a guilty pleasure for movie gluttons. The film starts in the 1970s with a bang literally as a New York mail clerk shoots a customer dead. This shocker serves as the framing device for the body of the film which occurs during the Italian campaign in 1944. U.S. troops were segregated then and we follow the men of the all-black 92nd Infantry Division as they spearhead a push into German-occupied territory. Director Spike Lee cant resist dialogue that feels like it came from the opinion column of a Harlem newspaper but hes at the top of his game in these tense early combat scenes. As the so-called Buffalo Soldiers make their cautious advance Lee swiftly sets up the logistics of the battle the personalities of a few key GIs and the horrific consequences of flesh meeting shrapnel. After a maneuver botched by an incompetent white commander strands four black soldiers behind enemy lines they take shelter in a hillside Italian hamlet about to be deluged with German reinforcements. Pvt. Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller) a gentle giant befriends a shell-shocked 9-year-old (Matteo Sciabordi) who conducts one-sided conversations with his dead playmate. Noble Sgt. Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke) and opportunistic Sgt. Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy) spar over the village beauty (Valentina Cervi) who conveniently learned English as a nanny. Cpl. Victor Negron (Laz Alonso) the teams radio operator relays orders from headquarters to stay put and kidnap a German soldier for interrogation. The film is ostensibly a flashback of Negrons experiences but the vantage point shifts capriciously between the Army men the local partisans and top brass on each side of the battle lines. Cinematographer Matty Labitiques Tuscan locations sear your eyeballs with beauty. The films MacGuffin -- the dramatic item that ties all the action together while being meaningless in itself -- is a beautiful statuary head that survived when the Germans dynamited a centuries-old bridge in Florence. (Thats one of those potentially great scenes the film frustratingly omits.) Train carries the head in a mesh sack tied to his belt and its relationship to the post office shooting moves the story through a brutal SS massacre a romantic rivalry art history a genuine miracle and courtroom drama. The film takes longer than it needs to get where its going but theres a juicy richness to its digressions that makes it entertaining. MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong war violence language and sexual content/nudity. While the screenplay takes pains to show that not all German troops were monsters and some American racists were its told in the sentimental ethnic stereotypes of wartime Hollywood. Italian men gesticulate when they talk and their daughters are earthy sensual creatures who parade in front of GIs topless and unembarrassed. Germans rarely speak when they can sneer. New Yorkers communicate largely through wisecracks. ""Miracle"" is far from the sensitive racial politics Lee is capable of delivering but darned if it isnt rousing good fun.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The heart of ""Miracle at St. Anna"" resides in the wondrous relationship of a lumbering black soldier and the wan Italian orphan he rescues. The intelligence in the World War II saga about four soldiers from the 92nd Infantry Buffalo Soldiers Division who find themselves in a Tuscan village ringed by German forces belongs to screenwriter James McBride whose 2003 novel provides the basis for the movie.  1/2 RATING | War Epic And the fiery passion of this oft-exquisite work of war and remembrance comes from director Spike Lee. A maverick who has challenged chastised and connected with audiences for more than two decades Lee brings a maturing sensibility and a talent for ensemble performance to a tale that is loving angry and profoundly American. The story opens during the 1983 holiday season in New York City. Postal worker Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) goes postal on an elderly Italian man at his window. In hopes of answering the why of the crime reporter Tim Boyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and two flatfoot detectives head to Negrons Harlem apartment. They discover his Purple Heart from WWII his shrine of votive candles and a priceless piece of statuary from a Florentine bridge destroyed by the Nazis. Negrons crime and later its prosecution act as introduction and prologue to ""Miracle."" Lee jams in lot of showy filmmaking. But the films most winning and muscular storytelling takes place in 1944 when soldiers Stamps Bishop Negron and Train are cut off from their company and land in the Tuscan town. Played by Derek Luke and Michael Ealy Sgt. Aubrey Stamps and Sgt. Bishop Cummings couldnt be more different. They are a study in counterpoint. Whats epic about ""Miracle"" isnt merely its wartime traumas. Its the filmmakers rich awareness of African-American variety that makes it grand. Lighter skinned Bishop is the strident one who takes to task white America and any blacks fool enough to feel they belong. Hes a race-man but his flirtations with town beauty Renata complicate his riffs. It wounds the more loyal Stamps to admit he feels more free in Italy in the midst of war than he does on American soil. Their arguments about the ""isms"" -- patriotism and racism -- become one of the films central philosophical debates. Fighting for a country that did not uphold equal rights at home was an issue that still raged during Vietnam. Alonsos portrayal of Negron who is Puerto Rican skirts Stamps and Bishops more rigid racial theories. Omar Benson Miller is poignant as the not-bright but utterly decent Pvt. Sam Train. Train is the original finder of the stone head found in Negrons apartment. Hitched to his belt it became the god-fearing giants awkward lucky charm. But the boy he finds in an abandoned barn becomes even more significant to his faith. Shot in Italy ""Miracle"" employs a number of native actors. As the fugitive partisan ""The Great Butterfly"" Pierfrancesco Favino has the careworn face of a man weary of a conflict that pits partisan friend against Fascistformer friends. But the true revelation is the perfect innocent Lee discovers in Matteo Sciabordi the 9-year-old who plays the boy constantly consulting an imaginary companion named Arturo. Lee is aware of the necessity and power of the close-up in a war flick. Combat dehumanizes. The close-up reconnects audiences with the individual. Lee extends this courtesy to a number of German soldiers. A scene depicting U.S. and German infantrymen cursing the race-baiting piped in come-ons of Nazi propaganda maven Axis Sally is one of the movies most riveting. Perhaps the most subtly powerful moments in ""Miracle at St. Anna"" comes as the four soldiers look into the camera then one after another walk away. They arent looking at us. They are looking at a piece of Nazi propaganda on a village wall that depicts them as subhuman. The scene follows a flashback in which a diner owner in Louisiana denies the men service while he feeds a group of German POWs. Four white enemy combatants eat and laugh. Four black soldiers in uniform suffer (not for long) the indignities of the n-word. ""Miracle at St. Anna"" begins with Hector Negron watching John Waynes D-Day classic ""The Longest Day."" We were there he says absently. The hurt in his voice could not be clearer. It requires a sophisticated gift to depict the myriad wrinkles of race and identity captured in this addition to the ""Greatest Generation"" pantheon. Its a gift for truths and the reconciliation that can come from them. Its a talent the at-times publicly contentious director continues to bring to the screen.

Comments Miracle at St. Anna Rated R  160 minutes With this adaptation of James McBrides novel Spike Lee aims for an African-American Saving Private Ryan that will recognize the bravery and sacrifice of the segregated soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division who helped liberate Italy in World War II. Malcolm X (1992) proved that Lee could rise to the challenge of a sweeping historical epic but this 160-minute drama is overblown and unconvincing the directors bright poppy style clashing with the grim subject matter. Lee is typically heavy-handed in detailing the racist treatment of black soldiers both at home and in the European theater but at least in these scenes hes fully engaged; the long stretch set in a Tuscan village behind enemy lines where the four heroes (Derek Luke Michael Ealy Laz Alonso Omar Benson Miller) wind up after being separated from their unit plays like second-hand Rossellini.

Spike Lees adaptation of James McBrides novel about four black soldiers during World War II is passionate but hampered by an inconsistent tone dull and overlong stretches cliched dialogue and a derivative story. At times it calls to mind Saving Private Ryan other times Flags of our Fathers and Life Is Beautiful. But its never as good as any of those films. It tries hard to be inspiring but it has jarring tonal shifts stereotyped characters and a lack of narrative perspective. A key character nurses a 40-year grudge but the circumstances in which it is avenged stretch credulity. Most of the movie is spent in a wartime flashback Members of the all-black 92nd ""Buffalo Soldier"" Division are trapped behind enemy lines in the Tuscan countryside. We are meant to be touched when one of the soldiers Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller) takes serious risks to save an Italian child. Miller does a fine job in a role that falls victim to the hackneyed Hollywood ""gentle giant"" cliche. He forges a bond meant to seem unlikely (though we see it coming early on) with the sad little boy with quasi-mystical qualities. But what should have been moving feels like a contrived formulaic concept rather than a real connection. Laz Alonso plays Hector Negron one of the four soldiers in the Italian saga. He survives the war earns a Purple Heart and appears to have led a happy life once back in New York. But the movie opens with him at his post office job rather calmly but decidedly ""going postal."" The entire film is structured to show us that his crime is not the isolated act of a man who has snapped but the result of a long-held and righteous grudge. Even after two hours of back story however it still doesnt ring true. Has this man kept a gun stashed at his station for decades in hopes that he would someday come face to face with the nemesis he fought in the war? Or did he just sense when the moment would come and act accordingly? What happens after Hectors crime is equally unbelievable with a strikingly artificial ending. No doubt theres a great story to be told among the individual sagas of the Buffalo Soldier unit but this one isnt it.

Watch Clips Moving Haystack The Boy Needs Help Miracles i Looking for a miracle Sam Train (Miller) and Angelo Torancelli (Sciabordi) struggle to survive Nazi-occupied Italy. David Lee/Touchstone hide caption toggle caption David Lee/Touchstone Looking for a miracle Private First Class Sam Train (Benson Miller) and Angelo Torancelli (Sciabordi) must struggle to survive Nazi-occupied Italy. David Lee/Touchstone Lets start by agreeing that Spike Lee was in large part right when he criticized Clint Eastwoods Iwo Jima films for doing what American war movies have done for decades -- leaving black soldiers out of the story. Hollywood has made very little effort to explore the contributions of African-American soldiers in World War II. And if segregation in that eras armed forces provides Tinseltown with an excuse it is long past time for a remedy. So a movie about the exploits of the all-black 92nd Infantry Division which landed in Italy in 1944 would seem to be just the ticket. But Lees adaptation of the novel Miracle at St. Anna inspired by the exploits of the 92nd proves problematic. It tells of a unit caught behind enemy lines; their white American commander refusing to believe theyve made the progress against enemy troops they say they have shells their position. The result is a bloodbath that leaves a river running red with the blood of perhaps a dozen black soldiers. For Lee somehow this sets up a story that almost immediately lurches into moments of broad comedy and even broader sentiment. Most of the latter involve a big superstitious soldier named Train (Omar Benson Miller) and a shell-shocked Italian boy (Matteo Sciabordi) he befriends. When the boy starts calling his protector a ""chocolate giant"" -- he even licks Train to see if he tastes like cocoa -- well at that point the directors headed into territory so precious its hard to find a way back to the films more serious themes. Some of those themes are familiar from Lees other films while others -- the suggestion for instance that the Nazis appreciated the capabilities of these black troops more than their white commanders did -- are freshly provocative. But nearly all the films thematic points get scattered as screenwriter James McBride adapting his own novel lets the story drift off in six directions at once filling the screen with stereotyped German creeps and peppy Italian resistance fighters a love triangle involving two American soldiers and an Italian siren (Derek Luke Michael Ealy and Valentina Cervi) two dueling sets of religious superstitions and one magical resurrection. Theres also an 80s murder mystery that bookends the rest of the story (with cameos by John Turturro John Leguizamo and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a flashback within the films central flashback to show us the discrimination faced by the soldiers in America. All that plus an overwrought tear-stained epilogue. Even in a film that clocks in at a quasi-epic 2 hours and 40 minutes thats just too much narrative. And matters arent helped by the fact that Lee who has never staged battle sequences before hasnt quite got the rhythms or camera angles right. There arent actually that many battles in Miracle at St. Anna as it happens but when they do crop up the explosions seem to come out of nowhere -- a little like that miracle the title refers to -- leaving the audience as disoriented as the soldiers and a good deal less engaged.

Though denigrated and infantilized by their white commanding officers the Buffalo Soldiers nonetheless defended the country that did not always defend their so-called freedoms.Lee can express more with a sweeping camera movement or an agitated edit than almost any other filmmaker working. One of the pleasures of Miracle is seeing a most imagistic filmmaker thinking visually. It doesnt hurt that cinematographer Matthew Libatique Lees collaborator on several films including Inside Man communicates the texture and temperature of every marshy riverbank stucco wall marbled floor and trembling trigger finger.But man oh man much of the dialogue is so heavy and heavy-handed that you can see fine actors such as Derek Luke and Michael Ealy buckle under the weight. Clearly Lee fell in love with McBrides words and couldnt bear to cut them even when the visuals made those words redundant.Lees principal theme is to celebrate the men of color who despite their experiences of stone racism fought and died for their country. And in this film with good and bad Germans saintly and sinister Italians humanistic and sadistic Americans the subsidiary theme is See the person not the nationality.Still its more challenging for the 92d Regiment than for their white brothers slogging across the Serchio River in the waning days of 1944. As they march the 92d can hear Axis Sally mouthpiece of German propaganda spewing those fears that the Buffalo Soldiers swallow back hard Why die for a country who treats them like slaves?The question resonates with two of the four soldiers who become detached from their unit. Sgt. Stamps (Luke) is willing to fight for an imperfect America in order to create a more perfect one; Sgt. Cummings (Ealy) is uneasily resigned to the fact that in this war blacks are cannon fodder. Meanwhile perhaps in reference to Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man the manchild called Train (Omar Benson Miller) rubs his talisman a white marble bust of Spring liberated from a Florentine bridge to render himself invisible and thus invincible to bullets.Trains adoption of a mute Italian urchin - think Dondi - with a painful secret and the quartets painless integration into a small Tuscan village make them feel more at home than when they are home.No sooner does he establish their stories than Lee pulls back to tell a larger story of brotherhood and betrayal involving Italian partisans and Fascists. The result is diffuse and often confusing and - a warning to the weak-stomached - shockingly but not gratuitously violent.Still at times as when our quartet seeks refreshment on a sultry day in the American South Lee shows that he does what he does better than almost anyone.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Spike Lee loses the battles and the war in ""Miracle at St. Anna"" a clunky poorly constructed drama designed to spotlight the little-remarked role of black American soldiers in World War II. Clocking in at 160 minutes this is a sloppy stew in which the ingredients of battle action murder mystery little-kid sentiment and history lesson dont mix well. Nor is it remotely clear who the audience is meant to be; the R rating pretty much rules out younger students and extensive subtitles will deter action fans who would be bored anyway. Best B.O. will likely be in Italy where most of the melodrama takes place. Pic is a particular disappointment after Lees reputation-restoring previous feature ""Inside Man"" which saw the director working imaginatively within an established genre. Same cant be said here as Lee has imposed no discipline on novelist James McBrides script which trudges from digression to digression to the detriment of any dramatic focus. It remains a wonder that no one from Lee to the various producers and studio execs demanded that someone whip this story into more sensible shape before the cameras rolled so obvious are its excesses and indulgences. Yarn starts with a murder case -- a sixtysomething black postal worker a devout man and recipient of the Purple Heart shoots a man who comes to his window to buy a stamp. News of his arrest and the fact he is in possession of a piece of Italian statuary worth millions has weird repercussions in Italy whereupon the action flashes back to Tuscany 1944 where the Yanks are putting the hard press on dug-in Nazis. Focus falls on the Buffalo Soldiers black soldiers within the 92nd Infantry division in the segregated American Army. A number of grunts are sent to ford a river beyond which Germans are thought to wait. The way theyre mowed down reinforces the notion that ""Eleanor Roosevelts niggers"" as they are derided by racist white officers are regarded as little more than cannon fodder. In one of the few successful touches the troops river crossing is accompanied by a propaganda broadcast from Axis Sally (Alexandra Maria Lara in an outstanding reading) who goes on about how their country doesnt care about them and even says the Nazis have nothing against the blacks. Making it across the river and shortly up to the small medieval village of Colognora are Second Staff Sergeant Aubrey Banks (Derek Luke); Sergeant Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy); Cpl. Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) the man charged with murder 40 years later; and PFC Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller). Train a large man with little military discipline and a preoccupation with religious superstition saves a 7-year-old boy Angelo (Matteo Sciabordi) and thereafter watches over him. This sort of heart-tugging and very Italian story strand hasnt been seen in an American war movie in years maybe even decades and one can see why; its embarrassing. The other three guys are made of sterner stuff but the film comes down with a case of severe lethargy once the men hole up in the village. Issues surrounding a fascist father his lovely daughter Renata (Valentina Cerri) whom Bishop gets the hots for internecine quarrels among the local partisans and the wait to figure out where the Germans are reduce the picture to the speed of a lumbering tank; two successive scenes of dreadful slaughter put the nail in the coffin. A coda blatantly attempts to pull the heartstrings but its not earned. Beyond the dramatic deficiencies the writing for character is not good so that even at the protracted running time the men dont emerge as strongly etched individuals. Train stands out because of his size and blubbery vulnerability Stamps is notable for his courage and ability to speak Italian and Bishop is the randy gold-toothed one -- but fully dimensional theyre not. Lee breaks up the slow flow by plugging in little episodes to dramatize discrimination notably in a flashback in which German prisoners are allowed to eat in a Southern diner but black G.I.s are not. ""I love Italy. I aint a nigger here"" one of them later says to further underline the point. Too bad the film wasnt better written to make the sentiment implicit rather than needing to be said. Production values are OK without being particularly notables and Terence Blanchards score drones on virtually throughout. Lees early-career cinematographer Ernest Dickerson handled second-unit chores.

With Miracle at St. Anna he tackles both an adventurous war movie and social commentary. A sprawling sometimes unwieldy epic his film perhaps tries to do too much in bringing the story of Black soldiers and their contributions to light. Its a worthy effort at times moving at others disjointed. The acting is good and the film shot on location looks great. But Lees best quality as a director his willingness to take on anything is in this case the most serious flaw. Based on James McBrides novel Miracle at St. Anna begins in the 1980s with a Black man alone at night watching a John Wayne war movie. He shrugs and mutters that ""we fought"" too. We next see him at work as a postal clerk. A man comes to his window and the clerk grabs a German Luger and shoots him. Then the movie becomes a mystery. The head of a statue is found in the killers apartment. Why? A reporter (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tries to get the story. Thus begins the flashback. And we land in Tuscany in 1944 in the heat of battle. The 92nd Buffalo Soldier Division is trying to cross a river but the incompetence and lack of trust their White commanding officer (Walton Goggins) displays leaves them sitting ducks. Four soldiers make it across Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke) Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy) Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) and Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller). Inside an abandoned hut Train a simple man finds an injured boy Angelo (Matteo Sciabordi). The boy also is evidently delusional often talking to an invisible friend. He refers to Train as the ""chocolate giant"" and they form a strong bond immediately. The soldiers and the boy end up hiding out in a village staying with a family whose politics are as jumbled and confused as the rest of Italys late in the war. The soldiers have to wait for their unit to connect with them and the boy has to heal. Train meanwhile becomes ever more protective of Angelo whom he is convinced has mystical powers. (The others arent convinced but desperate times can make believers out of just about anyone.) As the film progresses differences in the characters emerge. Each has his own beliefs about the war and his role in it shaped by his past; the focus shifts from one to another throughout the film. Yet they all serve with the knowledge that they are treated with more respect and equality in the small Italian village than they are back home. (Lee takes a staple of these films a racist White man refusing to serve Blacks in a diner and gives it a satisfying if unrealistic twist.) A horrific tragedy emerges along with its own mystery. Lee does not skimp on the violence and insanity of war and its costs. But he mixes those elements in with so many others that their power is if not muted at least denied full impact. Mysteries are solved but theres an awful lot going on here. Miller is quite good as Train portraying him not as dumb but naive innocent. Of course he relates to Angelo; despite size and color theyre not that different. And Sciabordi is outstanding able to convey that maybe he sees something the rest cant after all. But ultimately Miracle at St. Anna aims too high or at least at too many targets. Lee would have been better served to concentrate on one of the many aspects of the story. Its a noble effort to be sure but falls short of the bulls-eye. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Movie review Miracle at St. Anna -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Miracle at St. Anna -- 2 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Poor Spike Lee. You just knew the moment he lashed out at Clint Eastwood for leaving black soldiers out of his two-part Iwo Jima epic that he had really put his foot in it.And now heres proof. Miracle at St. Anna is Lees sloppy absurdly long mashup of combat film cliches. While Lee aimed to make this adaptation of James McBrides novel an epic of the African-American experience in the war the flimsy material hammy performances wasted characters and wasted time betray one inescapable fact What Spike doesnt know about World War II or even good World War II movies would fill a book. The story spins off a real incident an SS massacre of Italian civilians in the latter stages of the Italian campaign. Miracle at St. Anna ties that incident to a fictional one involving the real-life 92nd Infantry Division the only African-American unit (led by white officers) to see combat in Italy.The story is framed in a flashback. In 1983 an aged New York postal clerk shoots a customer he seems to recognize from long ago. A jaded cop ( John Turturro overstocked with cop banter) and a cub reporter (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) try to figure out why. They dont but a flashback lets us in on the secret. In 1944 four ""Buffalo Soldiers"" from the 92nd found themselves behind German lines in the mountains of Tuscany. They befriend locals including a mystical shell-shocked child who sees his savior the hulking simple and superstitious Train (Omar Benson Miller) as a ""Chocolate Giant."" Train totes around this Italian bust which he rubs for luck. The fetching Renata (Valentina Cervi) comes between two sergeants the straight-arrow Stamps (Derek Luke) and the swaggering Bishop (Michael Ealy). The Puerto Rican Hector (Laz Alonso) operates the radio and translates.The colorful townspeople the heroic partisan resistance fighters urbane Nazis who read and quote poetry incompetent and racist American officers -- Lee and McBride have conjured up a rich tapestry of recycled war-movie tropes. Characters pause to have sex remember racist incidents back home rail about ""the white mans war"" and ponder the racial ""progress"" they represent. Lee intercuts between the common prayers of Italians African-Americans and Germans as combat looms.A scene set in 1983 mocks the John Wayne hokum of The Longest Day which the postal clerk vet watches on TV. Lee falls into many of that movies excesses. With the exception of Luke his actors dont carry themselves as soldiers even bad ones. The tough G.I. slang sounds anachronistic and the cliches seem borrowed without understanding them. A soldier trapped in the middle of an open field during a firefight yells ""Cover me"" as though its something he (or Lee) heard in a movie.Filler scenes and pointless characters -- John Leguizamo is in Italy in 1983; why? -- stretch what could have been a lively minor adventure mystery into an ordeal that panders when it doesnt ponder. Its not Lees worst film. But its tone deafness connects it with an infamous list that includes She Hate Me Girl 6 and Bamboozled. He wanted to make his war movie and I love a good war film. Perhaps Lee should have watched a few good ones before tackling this. I hear Clint Eastwood has made a couple.

He cooked up a gourmet-popcorn heist thriller and stamped every moment with his personality. Lee until now has never made a movie -- good or bad -- that wasnt unmistakably his. His latest Miracle at St. Anna is the first Hollywood feature to tell the story of the African-American soldiers who fought in the U.S. armed forces during World War II  and as such its a movie with a monumental mission. Unfortunately thats more or less the only monumental thing about it. Miracle isnt powerful its muddled and diffuse and the disappointment of the film begins with what a hard time I had finding Spike Lee in it. Based on a 2002 novel by James McBride who also wrote the screenplay the movie has a drifting scattershot structure and no real organizing tone or style (if you wondered what Lees frozen-figure-on-receding-background shots might look like in a wartime setting then keep wondering). The bizarrely contrived framing device is set in the 1980s when a postal worker named Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) mutters in anger at an old John Wayne war flick on TV then shoots and kills a man who shows up to buy stamps. (He surely has his reasons but does he really get away with stashing a loaded Luger under his post-office window each day?) After his arrest Hector wont talk but a reporter finds a clue in the form of a priceless artifact hidden in his apartment the head of a statue that once adorned a bridge in Florence that was wrecked by bombs during World War II. From this labored and gimmicky setup the film flashes back to the itch and fear of battle as Hector along with other members of the all-black 92nd Infantry Division and its ""Buffalo Soldiers"" stalks the Tuscan countryside. Its September 1944 and as they try to cross the Serchio River the men are ambushed. The sequence has thunderous explosions jittery editing blown-up bodies -- everything but the virtuosity of staging that might have made the chaos and carnage revelatory instead of just a Saving Private Ryan rehash. Four members of the division end up stranded behind enemy lines all but abandoned by a racist commander. In addition to Negron theres Staff Sgt. Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke) a college-educated stoic devoted to his service; Sgt. Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy) furious at the world and a loose cannon with no loyalty to the country hes fighting for; and Pvt. Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller) a starry-eyed oversize simpleton who rescues and befriends an Italian urchin (Matteo Sciabordi). The dramatic focal point if you can call it that is the war of wills between Stamps and Cummings. These two play out a version of the assimilate-versus-agitate debate that has echoed through many decades of African- American life though this one would be more convincing if Ealy a dynamic actor had been asked to project his anger more in period with a little less proto-gangsta recklessness. The men arrive at a picturesque village where they mingle with the locals and Stamps and Cummings stoke their rivalry over Renata (Valentina Cervi) a married woman who is lovely in a saintly way. The film then veers into an endless murky subplot about the Italian resistance from which it never recovers. Miracle at St. Anna wants to do too many things at once to do any of them with much verve. It aspires to be a war epic but its dominated less by combat than by flat meandering talk. It wants to salute the flesh-and-blood valor of the Buffalo Soldiers but these unsung heroes are treated as such impersonally symbolic and stiff-jointed types that their heroism shines only faintly. The movie tries to be raw and real yet it isn?t above trotting out a tyke who might have stepped out of Cinema Paradiso II to tag along with the soldiers as a mascot of sentiment. There are vile Nazis on hand -- and also a nice Nazi who does a really good deed. Miracle at St. Anna winds up as a pastiche of racial-historical correction showboat atrocity murder mystery love story and windy meditation. Is it any wonder that it?s less than the sum of its ambitious parts? As odd as it may sound to say about a war film though the real trouble with Miracle is that Lee?s filmmaking is joyless. C?

"Miracle at St. Anna | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; miracle-at-st-anna ) Miracle at St. Anna (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Recently Spike Lee was in the news feuding with Clint Eastwood about the absence of black servicemen in Eastwoods recent Iwo Jima duology. According to Lee Eastwood ignored history in Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima by not making any of the American characters black. Eastwood succinctly responded by suggesting that Lee should ""Shut [his] face."" One could argue that Lees reason for making his complaint public was to garner publicity for Miracle at St. Anna the controversial filmmakers World War II tale about black soldiers in the European theater. Knowing Lee to be as passionate as he is outspoken I prefer to believe his words are reflective of his feelings rather than just sound bites useful for the promotion of a film. Maybe the distributor (Disney/Touchstone) feels otherwise. Miracle at St. Anna is historical fiction based on the novel by James McBride (who wrote the screenplay). It follows four members of the 92nd Infantry Buffalo Soldiers caught behind enemy lines in a small village in Tuscany during the waning days of the war. The Germans have become desperate and are turning against their Italian allies and the spillover of this conflict reaches all the way into the seemingly remote hiding place where Staff Sergeant Stamps (Derek Luke) Sergeant Cummings (Michael Ealy) Corporal Negron (Laz Alonso) and Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller) are awaiting extraction. While there they share some quiet moments with the locals care for a boy rescued by Train from a collapsing building and prepare for the inevitable that will accompany the arrival of the Germans. Lee emphasizes the prejudice experienced by black soldiers during the second World War in ways both subtle and obvious. One character tellingly remarks that he ""feels more free in a foreign country"" than at home. Sex between a black man and a white woman is not the taboo in Tuscany that it would have been in the United States although the sequences used to illustrate this have a distinct ""soap opera"" feel. The arguments presented in Miracle at St. Anna are not dissimilar to those uncovered in Edward Zwicks 1989 feature Glory although theres an 80 year gap between the time periods reflected in the movies and the earlier film is a more complete motion picture. Lee arguably becomes too heavy-handed with his decision to make a commanding officer a one-note racist. But its easy enough to understand why he pounds the pulpit so hard since stories of black wartime heroism are few and far between. (The Tuskegee Airmen is probably the best known of only a few examples.) The films acting is better than adequate and as is often desirable in ensemble pictures no one actor hogs the spotlight. The best performance is provided by Derek Luke who as the leader of the ragtag group radiates ability and moral uprightness. Stamps is the kind of man anyone would want to serve under in circumstances like this and Luke gives him the necessary dignity whether the scene is one in which hes planning the mens escape from Tuscany or one in which he is rebuffing the advances of an attractive Italian woman. As Cummings Michael Ealy has the unenviable job of playing the somewhat stereotyped part of the man whos good in a fight but a pain-in-the-ass when bullets arent flying. Ealy does whats needed though by mixing a brash hostility with a stark recognition of reality and crafting a personality that is by turns abrasive and sober. Laz Alonso Omar Benson Miller form the other two sides of the four-man rectangle. John Leguizamo and John Turturro provide cameos. Those expecting battle scenes will be disappointed. This is a war move with a minimum of fighting. The total of on-screen shooting tops out around 10 or 15 minutes - well under what one might expect from a film of this length about this subject. Limiting the action allows for more character interaction; unfortunately this aspect is of variable quality. Some of the quieter more reflective scenes work but many of the talky dialogue-driven ones do not. Although the majority of the movie takes place in the 40s the story is bookended by sequences transpiring in 1984 when a murder with World War II roots has occurred. While the near-contemporary opening draws the viewer into the story and creates a sense of mystery about the proceedings its questionable whether this approach to the material serves the story well. The back-end of the bookend forming the epilogue is contrived and unconvincing. Miracle at St. Anna is overlong and poorly focused. It tends to meander the military context is not well established and too much time is spent on interaction with underdeveloped secondary characters. On the other hand there are three exceptionally powerful sequences an event early in the proceedings during which members of the 92nd must face a verbal barrage from propagandist ""Axis Sally"" as they approach an engagement a German massacre at a church and the final battle against improbable odds. Theres enough energy in those scenes to indicate what Miracle at St. Anna could have been. Because of the subject matter its impossible not to admire what Lee has wrought here and the evident passion with which it has been brought to the screen. However the realization is flawed and those flaws make this 160-minute epic feel a little too much like an ordeal.

Before launching into my very mixed review of Mr. Lees 20th feature film in an over-20-year largely self-promoted career in the industry I must note that Mr. Lee once insulted me on an ABC Nightline panel after I had expressed my reservations about what I perceived as the excessive artiness of some of his projects. I dont remember the exact year but it was about the time that Mr. Lee was successfully campaigning for the job of directing Malcolm X after a white director had already been announced for the project. Mr. Lee agitatingly insisted that only an African-American could do justice to the story of Malcolm X and since he was doing all the agitating why not him? Actually at the time I tended to agree with him and said so on the telecast much to the discomfiture of the white moderator who had set out to build up a case of reverse discrimination against Mr. Lee. Anyway The Miracle at St. Anna runs far too long at two hours and 40 minutes even for the many interlocking stories Mr. Lee and Mr. McBride are trying to tell beginning with a mysterious murder in a New York City Post Office many years after the end of World War II. An elderly U.S. Postal employee pulls out a gun from behind his counter and shoots an equally elderly white customer. Detective Antonio ""Tony"" Ricci (John Turturro) is called in to investigate the case but it is cub reporter Tim Boyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who eventually gets the story from the perps own lips. This requires a feature-length flashback to the history of the 92nd Infantry Division of African-American draftees dubbed ""Buffalo Soldiers"" from way back to the Mexican War. The term appears also in John Fords Sergeant Rutledge (1960) with Woody Strode playing a particularly heroic Buffalo Soldier who is falsely accused of raping and murdering a white woman. He is acquitted of course after the real white rapist-murderer is exposed on the witness stand. The bulk of Mr. Lees narrative is concerned with the experiences of four Buffalo Soldiers the sole survivors of a virtually annihilated battalion of the 92nd Infantry Division stationed in Tuscany Italy in 1944. The division has been decimated by the artillery crossfire between the entrenched German forces on one side of a river and on the other the ill-timed American artillery response ordered by a misguided white American officer who couldnt believe that black soldiers had been the first to cross the river The four surviving Buffalo Soldiers are 2nd Staff Sgt. Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke) Sgt. Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy) Cpl. Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) and Pfc. Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller). The main point of the devastating battle scenes which are well handled by Mr. Lee and his technical crew seems to be that the African-American soldiers are much braver than the bigoted white American officers who are far behind the lines can bring themselves to believe. Indeed a white officer in one scene actually refers to the Buffalo Soldiers as Eleanor Roosevelts personal contributions to the war effort adding even more of a partisan slant to the undeniable racism of the period. A particularly vicious manifestation of this racism occurs in a flashback within a flashback when a Southern restaurant manager flashes a gun to tell the African-American soldiers that they are not wanted in his establishment. This even as he is allowing white Army military policemen to serve lunch to a booth full of Nazi prisoners of war. The now-armed Buffalo Soldiers return to get served by the same manager but the incident leaves them with a bitter taste in their mouths. When the four surviving black soldiers reach a small village in Tuscany the Italian inhabitants--who have never seen black people before--warmly greet their presumed liberators from the German occupiers. The inference is drawn that there is less racial bigotry here than in the States. The same comparison is made in Rainer Werner Fassbinders The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979) and the interracial sexuality in that film is even more prolonged and graphically explicit than it is here. But the heart and soul of The Miracle of St. Anna begins to take shape when Private Train the most provincial and least educated of the four surviving Buffalo Soldiers befriends a traumatized boy (Matteo Sciabordi). It is in this impromptu relationship that the first intimations of the religious and the miraculous appear. This otherworldly theme is continued in the reenacted real-life massacre of 450 townspeople men women and children for their not turning over the leader of the local anti-Fascist anti-Nazi partisans. There is also a very messy subplot about blood feuds within the partisan movement itself. And there are even moments of mercy and compassion from within the ranks of the Germans. Again I must commend Mr. Lee for his ease with the languages with which he has to deal. I suppose he is to be praised also for getting this immense project off the ground with brio and panache. But too much is too much in any language much less four. Consequently Mr. Lee has stretched his material in so many different directions that one is left with unacceptable levels of religiosity and sentimentality in the overall context of the naked brutality we have witnessed. Actually the film never ""solves"" the mystery of the murder in any satisfying fashion. Instead he seems to be saying that war is hell but that there is love and fraternal feeling to be found on the bloodiest battlefield. Kerry Washingtons pro-bono attorney for the accused murderer stays on the screen long enough to give a whispered tongue-lashing to the presiding judge leading me to wonder how many courtroom series Mr. Lee has been watching on television. It remains to be said that Mr. Lee has been less portentous and overloaded in the past. But opinions may differ on his ultimate place in film history and my mixed verdict on this occasion may be questioned by all and sundry Mr. Lee himself included. asarrisobserver.com Comment Filed under At the Movies Derek Luke John Leguizamo John Turturro Joseph Gordon-Levitt Laz Alonso Matteo Sciabordi Michael Ealy Miracle at St. Anna movie Omar Benson Miller Spike Lee Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2008/arts-culture/general-lee,200,miracleatst.anna29,miracleatst.anna,observer

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The War According to Spike Miracle at St. Anna is Spike Lees bloody blunt attack on the whitewashing of WWII. By David Edelstein Published Sep 21 2008 ShareThis (Photo David Lee/Courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures) Never one to soft-pedal his ambitions Spike Lee opens his grandiosely garish World War II epic Miracle at St. Anna with an old black man watching John Wayne in The Longest Day and muttering We fought for this country too. Its a naked declarationa big fat cinematic placardof Lees intention to reclaim not only American history but American movies and their whitewashing myths. And thats cool. As the most prominent African-American director of all time Lee feels entitled perhaps even obligated to challenge the malign neglect of the past. He was right to mouth off about Clint Eastwoods leaving black soldiers out of Iwo Jima (although his case was blunted by having once mouthed off about Eastwoods audacity in making a Charlie Parker biopicLee wants to be the keeper of his brothers stories). And he was canny to recognize in James McBrides novel about the all-black 92nd Infantry Division an ideal vehicle for his Flags of Our Fathershis The Longest Day. Lees canvas is impressively vast. The shock is in how coarsely he fills it in. In the jumpy prologue set in 1983 the old John Wayne contrarian a post-office teller shoots an Italian at his window with a German Luger he keeps conveniently at his desk and police searching his Harlem apartment find a long-lost marble head from a Florence bridge that was blown up by the Nazis. The film is a flashback in which we learn why the old man killed the Italian and why he bristled at Waynes laconic avowal to hold a small Italian village and who the hell is the middle-aged Italian guy who spilled his coffee in slow motion when he read about the murder. Along the way there are hideous atrocities and holy resurrections in addition to the heart-tugging story of a gentle-giant black soldier who adopts a traumatized Italian orphan. The movie skips from one formula to another with clunky debates a constant cynical blacks versus idealistic blacks; guilty Nazis versus bad Nazis; Italian partisans versus Italian Fascists. Lee screws up his best ideas by trying to blow us away. (He doesbut any blowhard can.) In the first battle sequence the buffalo soldiers slosh through a Tuscan river while a Nazi truck blasts the voice of Axis Sally the German counterpart of Tokyo Rose to entice them to surrender. The promise of shelter and food (fried chicken candied yams etc.) is an obvious lie but almost everything else hits home Theyre fighting for a country that once enslaved them and now keeps them segregated and small that uses them for cannon fodder. But Lee cant let the words hang in the air. He cuts to Axis Sally in her plush red lair a lipsticked white temptress. Then the cartoon-racist southern colonel whos miles from the scene refuses to believe these uppity Negroes have made it across the river and orders their location shelled. Lee lingers on the carnagethe limbless writhing men cut down by both Germans and Americans. Here and in a scene in which the Nazis machine-gun an entire village he thinks that showing the stark reality of war means shoving the horrors in our face. When the carnage is over only four men are left the stalwart Stamps (Derek Luke) the sardonic Bishop (Michael Ealy) the awkward dark-skinned Hispanic translator Hector (Laz Alonso) and the big simpleton Train (Omar Benson Miller). Its Train who clutches the injured Italian boy Angelo (Matteo Sciabordi) and carts him to a nearby villageeven after Bishop says to leave him be that all white people are trained to hate blacks. Miller overplays the lovable-galoot act (I aint never been this close to a white person) but hes hardly alone. The dialogue (by McBride) is subtext-free and the actors go broad when they cant go deep. Its hard to tune in to their rhythms anyway Terence Blanchards nonstop symphonic stirrings color every exchange. On its own terms the score is gorgeous; Blanchard transforms martial themes into sighing lamentations. But the music elegizes the characters before they can speak. Their doom is in every bar. When the soldiers stumble into a Tuscan village Miracle at St. Anna injects a bunch of exuberant Italians among them a stunning number (Valentina Cervi) who becomes the object of both Stampss quiet longing and Bishops salacious come-ons. There is one evocative moment in which the men realize they feel more free more at home than they do in the States. But when Lee isnt doing cinematic somersaults or mining for injustice he doesnt seem to know where to put the camera. The logistics of the plot make no sense and he has nothing to sell but the theme of our common humanityin which on the evidence I dont think he believes. His heart is really in defacing American iconography as when the black soldiers recall a Norman Rockwell-style diner back home and the owners refusing to serve themeven though a table was occupied by German prisoners. When the flashback ends the men stare balefully into the camera. The seconds crawl What are they glaring at? Us? It turns out to be some racist posters but I cant help thinking weve also been accused. 1 2 Next Share this story...
