Entertainment How Emily Blunt Shu Qi And Patrick Stewart Kicked Ass At Cannes Cartel thriller Sicario martial arts drama The Assassin and punks vs. skins movie Green Room brought some action to the famous film festival. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Emily Blunt in Sicario Richard Foreman Jr. / Lionsgate ID 5820556 The Cannes Film Festival isnt the first or even the 20th place youd think to look for kick-ass action fare. But this year Cannes showed off a solid if quirky hard-charging streak seen at its most epic in Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron hosing off the wasteland grit and war grease to walk the red carpet in designer gear for Mad Max Fury Road. George Millers Mel Gibson-free return to the Mad Max franchise 30 years after its last installment has become a solid box office hit as well as a critical darling and its presence at Cannes was a nice additional affirmation of just how good everyone agrees that Millers eye-searing chase epic is. Artful direction can take many forms including a high-speed melding of flesh and chrome at the end of the world. View this image > Benicio Del Toro in Sicario Richard Foreman Jr. / Lionsgate ID 5820561 But Mad Max Fury Road is also already in theaters -- old news -- in most of the world. Its fellow Cannes premiere Sicario isnt due out in the U.S. until September 18 carefully placed on the cusp of Oscar season. The performances merit it -- a splendidly slouchy Josh Brolin as a government agent whos nothing but trouble in a pair of flip flops an equally showy Benicio Del Toro as his mysterious and hyper-competent contractor and Emily Blunt in a more nuanced but also more thankless observer role as the Arizona FBI agent stuck repping the moral high ground.In a crackerjack opening scene Blunt and her task force partner (Daniel Kaluuya) raid a house outside of Phoenix where they believe hostages are being held by an encroaching tentacle of a Mexican cartel. They dont find hostages but they do find dozens of bodies sealed up in the drywall a horrifying discovery thats followed by an even worse one for those at the scene. Theres something as apocalyptic to the sequence as Fury Roads use of a person as a ""blood bag."" Its a nightmare tucked away in a mundane suburb and that feeling of invading darkness is one the film tries to sustain with less success as Blunts character is recruited by Brolins for a mission shes told almost nothing about. View this image > Sicario Richard Foreman Jr. / Lionsgate ID 5820460 Sicario comes from French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve who recently became attached to direct Blade Runner 2 and who has excelled in creating slightly heightened slightly larger-than-life realities. There was the abstract raggedness of the Pennsylvania suburb in which Prisoners morality tale played out the scarring grandeur of the unnamed Middle Eastern war in Incendies and the more obvious surreality of Enemy.Sicario is set in a landscape that feels a touch removed too a U.S. border where the cartel situation is escalating into something unimaginable and a task force that turns out to have an extreme approach to the problem. It strives for the procedural tension of Zero Dark Thirty and the mythic weight of No Country For Old Men and it brings to mind the Coens film in other ways -- Brolins presence Roger Deakins elegantly yellowed cinematography and a closing statement on the worsening state of the world.The last isnt really earned and the movies underlying cynicism doesnt come off as profound so much as overly dour especially when a character is advised to move away to a small town where the rule of law still applies provoking a viewer to think this person lives in Phoenix. Sicario is nevertheless gorgeously made with a set piece taking place in tunnels underneath the border that conveys chaos without ever looking incoherent and a throbbing Johann Johannsson score thats the sound of very bad things on the horizon. Shu Qi in The Assassin Via Well Go USA Chang Chen in The Assassin Via Well Go USA ID 5820468 Sicario may be pretty but looks-wise its got nothing on another Cannes competition title The Assassin which won Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien a Best Director award and which many thought was the main contender for the festivals big prize the Palme dOr. The combo of the wuxia genre and a filmmaker famous for making understated meditative work is an odd one and The Assassin has the framework of a martial arts movie while rarely getting around to actual martial arts -- the fights when they happen occur in brief efficient flashes of action staged as if the characters were more interested in actually killing each other than entertaining an audience.The film which will be released in the U.S. by Well Go reunites Shu Qi and Chang Chen who played lovers across eras in Hous earlier film Three Times but here they are at odds -- Shus an assassin and Chang is the lord and former fiance shes been sent to kill. Its 9th-century China and theres court and political intrigue all so opaquely outlined that its difficult to figure out whats on any of the characters minds at any given time particularly the impassive black-clad killer played by Shu. But oh its so lovely from the brocade draped interiors to the mist moving over a landscape in the half light like a series of confounding paintings placed end to end. View this image > Green Room Broad Green ID 5820661 Theres no mystery to be sorted in Green Room a punks vs. neo-Nazis movie that premiered in the Directors Fortnight section and follows a bloody survival struggle out in the Oregon woods. Its the latest from American indie filmmaker Jeremy Saulnier and expands on the approach to violence Saulnier used so well in his last movie Blue Ruin. He portrays it as carried out by people who have little experience with it and no idea what theyre doing and who are horrified by the mess and awfulness of what theyve been driven to do. Its a joltingly effective way to make action and gore feel fresh and distressing insisting on an awareness of the vulnerable physicality of everyone on screen -- especially when one of them is getting his throat torn out by a trained attack dog.Saulniers main characters a band called the Aint Rights made up of Anton Yelchin Alia Shawkat Callum Turner and Joe Cole score a makeup gig at a remote venue thats outside of their comfort zone skinhead-wise but promises to provide some much-needed dough to keep their tour going. Theyre the kind of kids whose idea of aggression is expressed through their opening their set with a cover of the Dead Kennedys ""Nazi Punks Fuck Off."" But when one of them walks in on a murder and it becomes clear that no one else is interested in calling the cops the four end up barricaded in the green room with the dead girls friend (Imogen Poots). Then the club owner and local white-supremacist leader (Patrick Stewart) turns up and everything escalates into guerrilla warfare as carried out by people whose only previous brush with it was at a paintball party. View this image > Green Room Broad Green ID 5820573 Its ingenious witty disturbing fun lead by a show-stealing Poots as the one member of the green room group who understands from the start just how deep the shit that theyre in is. The movies especially good at puncturing the hardcore airs of its baddies some of whom arent any more battle-hardened than the people theyre fighting despite the tough-guy stances. Green Room which doesnt yet have a U.S. distributor delivers hard-won jolts by actually treating its characters like flesh and blood humans who have no idea what theyre doing but who are figuring it out -- after all their lives depend on it.

"Sicario | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sicario ) Sicario (United States 2015) October 02 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embraces a bleak worldview or at least thats what his filmography would lead audiences to believe. His celebrated movies which include Incendies Prisoners and now Sicario (and will soon add the long-gestating Blade Runner sequel) are all as powerful as they are uncompromising. Villeneuve doesnt soften characters or mute story points in a quest to win at the box office. His films are dark enough to keep away those in search for two hours of escapism. Those who go to a Villeneuve production Sicario included must be prepared for intense suspense moral ambiguity and an ending that doesnt conform to Hollywood norms. Sicario (the title means ""hitman"" in Spanish) addresses the drug trade in an era after the so-called ""War Against Drugs"" has been lost. Skirmishes are still fought but even the key government agencies - the FBI CIA and DEA - admit that unless the demand for drugs drops to near-zero levels its impossible to stop the supply only control it. Sicario transpires near the Mexico/U.S. border with frequent forays into both countries. Although the film doesnt directly address immigration issues it makes a point about how porous the border is and hints that its to the advantage of some agencies and officials to keep it that way. Law makers law breakers cops robbers - in Sicario theres not much difference between them. The bad guys have traits one sometimes associates with those wearing white hats and vice versa. Drug dealers can love their families and Federal agents can torture and kill without compunction. Does the end justify the means?  It depends on ones perspective but those who answer ""no"" are likely to find themselves outmanned outgunned and potentially on the endangered species list. FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) believes in the concepts of justice and jurisdiction. She and her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) are among a dwindling number of true believers - a fact that becomes evident when they join a cross-agency task force led by the shady Matt (Josh Brolin) and the even more shady Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). These two earn Kates trust by claiming that their goal is to stop a terrorist whose bombs are killing her people.  That isnt a lie but what they dont tell her is that their methods will challenge her moral fiber. From Matt and Alejandros perspective theres no such thing as an ""innocent"" bystander - only collateral damage. Sicarios grim unpredictability amplifies the sense of tension. The movies first act builds to a border crossing so fraught with suspense as to be almost unbearable. Credit Villeneuves approach - shot selection (Roger Deakins is the cinematographer) editing and Johann Johannssons discordant score. The films action scenes eschew the traditional mainstream approach - theyre quick brutal and dispiriting for the participants. Its refreshing to find a director who is willing to show violence without celebrating it. Emily Blunt has appeared in romantic comedies action movies science fiction tales historical dramas - you name it shes done it. Never before (not even in Looper) has she been asked to take a character as far into darkness as she is with Kate. Its an arresting performance as she becomes the viewers surrogate in this ethical minefield. The character is a little naive but she recognizes this quality and doesnt consider it a shortcoming. As a result she learns a few hard lessons. Blunt is supported by Josh Brolin in the kind of role hes played before - a seemingly laid-back guy with a spine of iron. Benicio Del Toro is frightening as the steely-eyed Alejandro whose motivations once revealed transform him into a quasi-tragic figure. Hes more a force of nature than a human being. Think in terms of a Terminator. Two years ago Villenueves Prisoners opened early in the Oscar Season and was unfairly neglected by the Academy despite a strong story and a series of powerful performances. The reason it was depressing and fared poorly at the box office. Sicario may face some of the same challenges but whether it earns Oscar recognition or not its an unforgettable motion picture that should be on the must-see list for anyone who appreciates films that deal in grays rather than blacks and whites.

Or maybe thats just the sensation you get coming out of ""Sicario.""This dense twisty unsettling nerve-racking thriller has that kind of effect. Its about lies and truths lies packed within truths and questions about what constitutes either and its designed to keep viewers off balance and at attention. By the end it packs a death stare so potent it will make you want to turn a blind eye to the shadowy brutality of its real-world horrors.Emily Blunt is Kate Macer an FBI agent near the U.S.-Mexican border who as the film opens discovers a nightmare drug den packed tight with decaying corpses. Shes enlisted by a team of government officials -- including Matt Graver (Josh Brolin never cooler or more dialed in) who with his eyeglasses floppy haircut and sandals looks like he could lead the office softball team and Alejandro Gillick (an understated menacing Benicio del Toro) whose affiliations are unclear -- and joins a joint task force assigned with taking down a Mexican drug cartel.Thats the set-up and Macer is kept at bay as she asks questions and receives vague answers as to what theyre doing and on whose authority theyre doing it on.But its clear something is off and Macer is the audience conduit as she falls deeper inside the rabbit hole.Channeling Steven Soderberghs ""Traffic"" director Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners"") stages several breakneck sequences including a hyper-tense standoff at the Mexican border. But his best moment is a quiet one involving the deep wells in Del Toros eyes.Like those peepers ""Sicario"" is unflinching and unrelenting.

(RICHARD FOREMAN JR.)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 03 2015As FBI agent Kate Macer the head of a kidnap-response team based in Phoenix Emily Blunt has the steady steely mien of a seasoned veteran accustomed to working her way through hostage lairs firearm pointed forward anticipating alert.But at a certain point in Sicario the bloody cross-border thriller that also stars Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro a more troubled look begins to cross the actress face. ""Why am I here?"" she seems to be saying - and in fact pretty much does say - as she joins an interagency task force hops a private jet to Juarez and becomes party to some decidedly brutal extralegal behavior.Sicario directed with an air of ghostly dread by Denis Villeneuve ( Prisoners Incendies) never satisfactorily answers Agent Macers question. Its a fundamental flaw in a movie that nonetheless succeeds in evoking the anarchic violence of the drug wars raging on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border.Its a horrorscape that has been addressed in the recent documentary Cartel Wars and the FX series The Bridge but Villeneuve paints it in chilling strokes bodies hanging from an overpass in a city street; the discovery of corpses - scores of them - concealed behind the drywall of a house; corrupt cops (Mexican and American) carrying drugs and carrying out hits.Im not sure if leavening is the right word but Brolin as an enigmatic U.S. agent with a world-weary cynicism and a black-ops vibe provides at least a dose of (very) dark humor to the proceedings. His Matt Graver has clearly rubbed shoulders with Del Toros Alejandro before. On several occasions Kate finds herself in the company of Alejandro (if thats even his real name) who is definitely not from any law enforcement bureau she knows trying to get at who he is why theyre here what their mission is.""Youre asking me how a watch works"" he responds heavy-lidded tamped-down. ""For now just keep an eye on the time.""Talk about brush-offs.Sicario means ""hit man"" in Mexico according to a title card and it doesnt take a genius to figure out which of the players the role fits best. There are strong supporting performances here - Daniel Kaluuya as Macers partner shunted to the sidelines; Victor Garber as a high-up bureaucrat; Julio Cedillo as a Sonoran drug lord.Roger Deakins who filmed Villeneuves Prisoners goes close in with his cameras bringing a naturalistic intensity to the proceedings. One sequence deploys night vision and infrared lenses. An SUV convoy into Mexico is covered with swooping aerial photography and a botched reentry into the States - Kate and her colleagues trapped in bumper-to-bumper traffic surrounded by potential shooters - ricochets with cross-cutting suspense.Toward the end of Sicario after all sorts of retribution and rogue behavior Kate gets some advice ""You should move to a small town where the rule of law still exists.""Its a great line even if it doesnt help solve the puzzle of why she was here in the first place.sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629 Steven_Rea Sicario  (Out of four stars) Directed by Denis Villeneuve.

Updated July 29 2016  1153 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Sicario is an engrossing tale of drugs and violence By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Oct 1 2015 (...) FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted an assignment to battle drug cartels at the U.S.-Mexican border. But its not long before shes as nervous about her colleagues in the field as she is about the criminals theyre presumably targeting.Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) leader of the inter-agency operation seems reluctant to share any information with her that cant be categorized as need-to-know. Even shadier is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) a ""sicario"" (hitman) who is said to have once been a prosecutor in Mexico but doesnt seem the least bit concerned with legal niceties.With no one to trust Macer looks on in astonishment as bullets fly blood spurts and bodies fall. If this is the war on drugs shes a serious candidate for conscientious objector status. ""Sicario"" in Hollywood parlance is ""Traffic"" (2000) meets ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012). Like the former it portrays the drug trade as a hellish maze. Like the latter it questions the morality of lawlessness in the name of justice.Working from a screenplay by Taylor Sheridan director Denis Villeneuve doesnt flinch from exposing the dark side of law enforcement. In spirit ""Sicario"" is a sequel to his 2013 film ""Prisoners"" which also explored the tragic repercussions of violence. The new film reaches its apotheosis in a scene of retribution that casts Alejandro in an unsparing but revelatory light -- and dares the audience to identify with him. The performances are outstanding. Blunt who almost upstaged Tom Cruise in last years ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is the still center around which the narrative revolves. In his best role since ""No Country for Old Men"" Brolin delivers a portrait of cool smiling menace. And Del Toro who took home an Oscar for his turn as a soulful cop in ""Traffic"" is unsettlingly enigmatic. Far from being just another crime story ""Sicario"" is cinema at its most ambitious.What ""Sicario""  31/2 stars out of four  Run time 201  Rating R  Content Violence grisly images language  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Sicario Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Emily Blunt Josh Brolin Benicio Del Toro Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

"Sicario (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Sicario (R) Emily Blunt stars as an FBI agent in Denis Villeneuves drama about the U.S.-Mexico drug war. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/30/2015 Editor rating 3.5 Practically every character in Sicario runs around brandishing a firearm and yet each time a gun goes off in the movie youre startled and you flinch. The sound never loses its urgency its sense of immediate danger straight through to the closing shot of the film. This is not the first movie about the war being waged across the U.S.-Mexico border over the drug trade but its the first film in which the aura of constant menace and threat lingers and follows you home. The evil is palpable almost physical and it hovers like a cloud. Its toxic and it poisons anyone who comes within reach of it. The point of Sicario which was written by Taylor Sheridan (an actor best known for playing a cop on Sons of Anarchy) and directed by Denis Villeneuve (who previously delved into murky moral waters with Incendies and Prisoners) is that no one gets out of the drug war alive -- or at least unscathed. This is a radically different feeling than Steven Soderbergh conveyed with his Oscar-winning Traffic 15 years ago another movie about the same subject matter that argued that the forces of good would somehow win out. Sicario brushes aside that sort of optimism. In its opening setpiece -- a nerve-shredding raid by the FBI and SWAT forces on a home in Chandler AZ -- a female agent Kate (Emily Blunt) encounters a ghastly unthinkable horror that primes the stage for what follows. This is what the war on drugs looks like on the ground level corpses entombed in walls booby traps grave collateral damage. Kate who has borne witness to the carnage is drafted by a U.S. government operative Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who may or may not be CIA to help flush out a Mexican kingpin responsible for countless murders. Kate signs on for the mission even though shes not made privy to its details. Soon shes in Juarez where dismembered corpses hang from powerlines and flyers for the missing line the streets. Kate does what shes told following the lead of Graver and his associate Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) who claims to be a former Colombian prosecutor now helping the U.S. government. When shes caught in a gunfight south of the border that is clearly illegal she complains to her superiors only to be shut down. In Mexico they tell her the law doesnt apply. But if it doesnt apply there then why here? Sicario was shot by the formidable Roger Deakins (the greatest cinematographer never to have won an Oscar -- yet) and scored by Johann Johannsson with electronica that throbs and churns with dread and fear. Its music from the apocalypse. The narrative is simple but its layered and diabolical. Villeneuve wrings tension out of simple things (youve never seen a jug of water look this scary) to match the hair-raising suspense of elaborate setpieces such as a chase through underground tunnels seen through night-vision goggles that makes Zero Dark Thirty look like schoolyard games. Blunt is the audience surrogate trying to make sense of the spiraling madness before her constantly catching up because shes never played a game quite like this one (here is a rarity in the crime-drama genre a female protagonist who acts like a woman instead of a man). Brolin is fiendish and seductive the sort of devil so sure of himself he will smile as he lies to your face and doesnt care if you believe him. But the dark heart of Sicario belongs to Del Toro as Alejandro who is always paying attention and seems to be three steps ahead of everyone else. Del Toro hasnt seemed this energetic and present since well Traffic. Early in the film he tells Kate ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears and you will doubt everything you do. But in the end it will all make sense."" This harrowing movie proves him horribly mercilessly right. Cast Emily Blunt Benicio Del Toro Josh Brolin Victor Garber Jon Bernthal Daniel Kaluuya.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Sep 25 2015 Culture Sicario the new film by the French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is in effect two separate movies. One is terrific and one quite good but the two coexist in uneasy tension.The first movie-within-the-movie which takes up two thirds or so of the overall running time is essentially a war film involving two nations--the United States and Mexico--that are not technically at war. On one side is the Sonora drug cartel; on the other a variety of elusively defined covert U.S. agencies and one moderately bewildered FBI agent.Related Story A Cinematic Love Letter to Riding a Bike Through Mexico City The film opens with a bravura sequence as that FBI agent Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) and members of her heavily armed kidnap-response team converge on an unprepossessing house in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler Arizona. The team makes its entrance by bursting into the living room. In a tank. Once the gunfire subsides it turns out that there are no kidnappees on the premises to rescue. But stashed within the walls of the house are dozens of decomposing corpses that loom like hellish apparitions quasi-mummified and with plastic bags cinched tight over their heads.A special task force is charged with dealing with the root sources of what the television news is calling the ""House of Horrors."" And owing to her reputation as a ""thumper"" someone whos ""been kicking in doors since day one"" Kate is invited to join on behalf of the FBI. The head of the task force is Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who is vaguely described to Kate as a ""DoD consultant."" He is irreverent enough to attend high-level meetings in a T-shirt and flip-flops and important enough to have no one mention it.The task forces objectives are obscure Matt describes them initially as ""to dramatically overreact"" and later ""to stir the pot."" To begin with they involve taking a heavily armed contingent across the border to Juarez to pull a cartel man out of a Mexican prison and bring him back the States. What follows is a sequence of stunning cinematic virtuosity and the most thrilling exercise in sustained suspense to come along in a good while. The caravan of five black Chevy Tahoes--containing Matt Kate a dozen or so ""friends from Delta"" and a mysterious additional operative Alejandro (Benicio del Toro)--rumbles over the border bridge and is met by a fleet of Mexican police trucks bristling with machine guns which underscore the present danger far more than they mollify it.The cinematography is by the great Roger Deakins (more on this in a moment) and under his lens the low-lying sprawl of Juarez itself becomes a character as menacing as the Mogadishu of Black Hawk Down or the Baghdad of The Hurt Locker. (The difference of course is that its a stones throw away from El Paso.) I will not describe the outcome of the mission except to say that there are inevitably bumps along the way. Im confident that never before have the phrases ""red Impala two lanes left"" and ""green Civic three lanes left"" conveyed such imminent peril.Im confident the phrases ""red Impala two lanes left"" and ""green Civic three lanes left"" have never conveyed such imminent peril.From there Sicario (the term is Mexican slang for ""hitman"") proceeds as a high-intensity procedural--except for the crucial distinction that theres little or nothing in the way of recognizable ""procedure"" on display. Matts paramilitary plans remain unexplained and almost certainly illegal and thats to say nothing of the inscrutable Alejandro. Moreover the reasons for Kates inclusion on the task force become less and less clear Initially it seemed she was being brought along for her SWAT-team grit. But it quickly becomes evident that Matt has all the firepower he needs and in any case as the increasingly frustrated Kate points out on more than one occasion ""Im not a soldier""Blunt builds on her recent work in Looper and (especially) Edge of Tomorrow presenting another portrait in rugged femininity all wary eyes and chiseled jawline. Brolin brings to Matt a jocky swagger reminiscent of his lead performance in W and Del Toro hiding behind beard and sunglasses offers a heavy enigmatic charisma as Alejandro. As director Villeneuve again demonstrates (as he did with Prisoners also shot by Deakins) a knack for ominous mood and for ratcheting up almost painfully the tension of a moment.As for Deakins what further accolade can be thrown to arguably the best cinematographer working today? (Oh thats right he can finally win an Oscar after a dozen unfulfilled nominations. Someone get on that.) Deakins plays with a variety of tricks in Sicario aerial and landscape shots (some reminiscent of Cary Fukunagas work on the first season of True Detective) night vision thermal imaging. There are powerful echoes of his magnificent border-state work in No Country for Old Men as well. The overall result is the best-looking film of the year to date.In the end though it is unlikely to be the best film full-stop. In its latter acts the script by Taylor Sheridan veers onto a different narrower course. What began as (apparently) a serious political film instead settles for the less demanding obligations of genre as the plot becomes more far-fetched edging toward fable. The narrative point of view mistakenly shifts from Kate to Alejandro and what began as a critique of violence comes to resemble a stylish exercise in it. This second movie-within-the-movie is not a bad movie merely a different one. But it does to some degree betray the extraordinary promise of what came before. This is the risk with having set its own bar so high Sicario is a remarkable thrilling intermittently brilliant film--and yet nonetheless a mild disappointment.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

Any nagging dissatisfactions are dispatched with elegance and aplomb by his directorial denoument. Not so Sicario his exploration of the brutal violence and moral complication surrounding the war on drugs. Critics looking to get a pull-quote on the poster would likely call it ""a stunning visual ride full of suspense and intensity"" and they would not be wrong. But oh that slip on the landing. This time its the opening that really astonishes an FBI raid on a suburban Arizona home led by star thats been converted into a cartel outpost and storage facility. Here and throughout Villeneuve excels at approaching the carnage to come from a great safe distance and the message seems clear here is a problem of vast scope and scale being engaged by huge and complicated forces and here are its intimate bloody effects. And further while you dare not look away the looking may serve to render the horrific as commonplace. What can one person hope to do in the midst of such a struggle especially when she finds herself reduced from elite squad leader to confused observer? Well she can stick to her guns literal and otherwise. Villeneuve knows this but gets distracted by his eagerness to acknowledge the moral muck that stains us when we wrestle with monsters.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 25 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 25 2015 102AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Denis Villeneuve Written by Taylor Sheridan Starring Emily Blunt Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro Genre action Country USA Language English Dozens of corpses line the walls of a derelict Arizona house. Mutilated bodies hang from an overpass in Juarez Mexico. Limbs fly after an explosive device catches FBI agents by surprise. These are just a few of the bright and cheery images offered in Denis Villeneuves Sicario the directors latest treatise on the horrors of man. But while the films visuals and narrative are pitch-black - or perhaps a shade of reddish black with all that blood and viscera - Villeneuve (Prisoners Incendies) once again proves he can craft a gripping tale that never collapses under its own moral weight. Sicario is not an easy film to watch but it is a riveting and essential one.The plot is simple if obsessed with appearing more twisted than it actually is In Arizona an FBI agent named Kate (Emily Blunt) is nearing burnout as her team faces the gruesome ripple effects of Mexicos drug wars. Constant kidnappings money laundering a stream of fresh villains there seems to be no end to her agencys fight against the cartels. Just as Kate recovers from her latest bust though along comes the mysterious DEA official Matt (Josh Brolin) and his even more shadowy colleague Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) who both promise her the chance to cut the cartel snake off at its head.What follows are several scenes of big men with bigger guns ""dramatically overreacting"" as Matt aptly puts it. A stop at the Mexico-U.S. border starts as a marvellously tense prisoner-exchange but two minutes later there are bullet-riddled thugs and buckets of sweat. A raid on a drug-smuggling tunnel plays like a high-art cross between an episode of COPS and Zero Dark Thirtys night-vision assault on the Bin Laden compound. Even one moment of seeming levity mutates into a near-death experience for Kate who is saved by what can only be called a Del Toro ex machina.The cumulative effect of all this doom could easily be numbing. After all Villeneuve has created a world where the body count is impossible to tally everyone has a hidden agenda and the war on drugs is less a defined battle than a multibillion-dollar ouroboros metaphor. But though this hell might be unbearable for those trapped within it - Kates downtime is basically spent washing the blood from her hair - it is startling pulse-pounding cinema. Aided by Roger Deakinss smooth and steady cinematography Villeneuve finds beauty in the carnage Never has a pile of corpses looked so well intriguing. Call it exploitative but this is horror as high art.The fact that the director does all this while still delivering an elegant if blunt lesson in geopolitical affairs is impressive. Doubly so when you consider that the three main characters exist in so many wonderful shades of grey. Kate is never boxed into the standard ""kickass-heroine"" role a la Sarah Connor or Ellen Ripley. Matt is all cocky swagger but his confidence belies a hidden darkness. And Alejandro the most enigmatic of the trio carries a back story worthy of its own cinematic universe (something that the Sicario producers are contemplating at this very moment). We can thank Villeneuve and rookie screenwriter Taylor Sheridans tight script but also Blunt Brolin and Del Toro each of whom has never been better.Villeneuve who got his start in Quebec with his similarly righteous and intense Maelstrom often gets labelled a miserabilist. But if his desire to explore the dark results in such compelling films then misery loves company.

But the subject and perspective are relentlessly grim.In his debut screenplay Taylor Sheridan (best known for his recurring role on TV biker drama Sons of Anarchy) explores the complicated legal and moral territory covered by officials on both sides of the border. A Texas native he visited Mexico often as a kid and wanted to explore the anarchic violence that reigns there. He finds a rocky landscape where even the most righteous can find themselves doing wrong.Director Denis Villeneuve skilfully brings the story to life setting finely tuned performances to a cacophonous soundtrack under Roger Deakinss masterful lens to create a searing and timely thriller.Kate (Emily Blunt) is a by-the-book FBI agent invited to join a covert operation after discovering a house full of corpses believed to be the work of a Mexican drug cartel. She joins cocky government agent Matt (Josh Brolin) and mysterious operative Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) both of whom bend the law as their needs dictate.Kate is whisked into Juarez Mexico a blood-spattered battleground where headless bodies hang from bridges and gunfire rattles as background noise. She is after those responsible for the murders of the people in that house but Alejandro and Matt have bigger plans They want the cartel kingpin and dont plan to take him alive.Kate also learns that Alejandros motives are not so clear-cut as they initially seemed. He is vengeful and focused cryptic and poetic. To him finding the cartel boss ""would be like discovering a vaccine"" to the addiction death and corruption that drugs cause.Blunt and del Toro act with their eyes which is perfect here. Hers alternately convey interest anxiety and determination. His half-mast glance says Alejandro has seen more than he ever wanted to. As the story progresses his personal connection to the cartels becomes more clear blurring the shades of grey even more.Deakinss breathtaking photography is all about darkness and light and the space between the two a perfect visual expression of the storys themes. After 11 nominations let this be the film that finally brings Deakins his Oscar.The sense of doom in Sicario also shines through in Johann Johannssons foreboding score which goes from industrial grating to sounding like a fog horn.Villeneuve has crafted a compelling unflinching look at the deadly and complicated war on drugs one that will challenge the attitudes of even the most straight-edged and law-abiding viewers.The director will take on similar themes again in his next film the sequel to Blade Runner. Sicario suggests he is ready.

She quickly finds herself in over her head. The story opens with an FBI takedown in Arizona that starts off as one thing and turns into quite another. A carefully planned raid yields unexpected results in the way of grotesque death and destruction. When the dust settles special agents are all over the crime scene; suspected drug cartel activity has brought out the big guns. Soon a government task force is being organized to go after a particular drug kingpin in Juarez. Kate is invited to join a group led by Matt (Josh Brolin) and the somewhat mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro); these guys dont seem to answer to anyone a disconcerting situation for an agent as idealistic as Kate. Sicario is told mostly from her point of view so her confusion is ours -- Kate moves forward based on the assumption that shes on the right side of this mess but shes never really sure what the stakes are or what the outcome should be. Blunts character is on high alert as are we; her uncertainty is ours. A viewer is always slightly off balance as the narrative unfolds. Kate is dedicated to the task at hand and she gives her all to the war on drugs. That shes a pawn in a much bigger game and that its all morally ambiguous is just part of the territory. Director Denis Villeneuve aided and abetted by cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall Prisoners) fills Sicario with dread and a violence that happens to be stunning to look at. The movie moves from one potential life-or-death scenario to another -- a border crossing where every car in the traffic jam might contain an assassin; a claustrophobic trip into a secret tunnel at night; a raucous night at a honky-tonk -- and its all soaked in menace. Sicario delves into shades of grey and even the settling of old scores can be dressed up as law enforcement. Villeneuves excellent cast includes Victor Garber Jon Bernthal Daniel Kaluuya and Jeffrey Donovan. The movies big surprise is Emily Blunt completely convincing as an experienced FBI agent who works hard to mask her vulnerabilities and almost succeeds. Her naivete about Americas war on drugs and her awakening to the realities of the world outside her countrys borders add a political element to the story that is both chilling and timely. Above all Sicario is a great yarn. Its been deemed award-worthy since the beginning (the film was nominated for the Palme dOr at the Cannes Film Festival last spring) and will no doubt be a contender at the Academy Awards in February.

Sept. 24 2015SicarioStarring Emily Blunt Benicio Del Toro Josh Brolin Victor Garber and Jon Bernthal. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. At Scotiabank Theatre. 121 minutes. 14AGrey becomes the darkest shade of black in Sicario Denis Villeneuves arresting new drug war thriller.The line between good and evil is blurred with sinister intent on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border threatening to corrupt even the one character whose motives are pure Emily Blunts Kate Macer a fearless yet idealistic FBI field agent.Article Continued BelowHoping to halt and apprehend the Mexican drug lord responsible for the horror she uncovers at the outset -- an Arizona house stacked with corpses -- she agrees to fall in with a shadowy U.S. anti-cartel task force run by Josh Brolins Matt Graver a man of easy smile and unclear intent. Emily Blunt stars in Sicario.Assisting them is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) a former Mexican prosecutor of tight lips and no last name who now works as a freelance fixer for whoever meets his price no questions asked.There are actually many questions asked in the film mainly by an increasingly concerned Macer but Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan provide no easy answers for the erosion of civilization they depict in their awards-worthy drama.""Nothing will make sense to your American ears and you will doubt everything we do"" Alejandro tells Macer and onlookers must take note. Very little of what she is being asked to do jibes with correct police procedure. Her involvement implies complicity uneasy though it is and Graver does seem to be getting results in the ""war on drugs."" But at what cost to morality conscience and the rule of law?Even more so than Steven Soderberghs 2000 drama Traffic with which it shares a narrative backdrop and also an excellent actor (Del Toro) Sicario paints the bleakest of portraits of a realistic situation drawn from headlines about Mexican cartels that stack bodies with savage efficiency. The butchery seeps into the soul like the storm clouds gathering over Mexico witnessed from an American rooftop. Cinematographer Roger Deakins who also lensed Villeneuves Prisoners another film of tangled ethics renders a world where the rainbow seems frightened to reveal itself.A terrifying scene at a border checkpoint outside Juarez Mexico unfolding with masterful suspense and composer Johan Johannssons Hitchcockian score shows just how ruthless the ""good guys"" are willing to be. It would be easy to dismiss Blunts character as a mere dove in ""the land of the wolves"" as someone does at one point. This would be a mistake. Power comes through restraint for both character and actor.Shes not afraid to use lethal force when necessary. But those storm clouds continue to gather making it hard to discern the light from the dark.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Richard Foreman Jr SMPSP/Lionsgate) By Stephanie Merry September 24 2015 Follow stephmerry Sicario"" certainly knows how to make an entrance. The movie opens with a SWAT truck crashing through the front wall of a drug lords house prompting a chaotic gunfight. Before the audience has even gotten its heart rate under control a sickening discovery is made Forty-two bodies have been hidden behind the drywall each one with a plastic bag covering its decomposing head. And thats before a bomb rigged as a booby trap rips off a mans arm. Is this a horror movie or an art-house morality tale? The reputation of director Denis Villeneuve -- the man behind ""Incendies"" ""Prisoners"" and ""Enemy"" -- suggests that its the latter. But the distinction wont make your nightmares any less hideous. The leader of that unfortunate FBI tactical team is Kate Macer (Emily Blunt). A by-the-book agent based in Arizona shes frustrated with losing the war on drugs which inspires her to volunteer for a mysterious interagency task force. The head of that team Matt (Josh Brolin) dresses like a surfer and refuses to share many details of their mission with Kate other than the fact that theyre heading to El Paso. Theyre not. With little explanation they drive across the Mexican border to Juarez where bodies are shown hanging from bridges and where they dont technically have jurisdiction. So much for following rules. For the viewer Kate is a proxy struggling to figure out why she was recruited for this vague possibly illegal assignment and what exactly Matts job is. Does he work for the CIA or Defense? And who is his mysterious right-hand man the aloof lupine Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro)? When Kate asks the Mexico native whom he works for he tells her ""I go where Im sent."" And thats one of their more substantive conversations. In ""Sicario"" which translates as ""assassin"" the suspense is relentless propelled by a driving score by Academy Award nominee Johann Johannsson. As Kate Alejandro Matt and a team of military operatives recently returned from Afghanistan barrel through the streets of Juarez in black SUVs the pounding beat recalls a war drum. The sound alone is enough to induce sweaty palms. Villeneuve keeps the audience on edge by alternating quiet moments with sudden bursts of action. Just before that truck tears through the house at the beginning of the movie for example the camera settles on a solitary man watching television in his living room. Every scene of calm potentially is trip-wired for an explosion. [Director Denis Villeneuve walks a fine line between art and commerce] But for all its chilling tension and horrific imagery ""Sicario"" is also a beautiful movie. Maybe cinematographer Roger Deakins will finally win the Oscar he deserves. (The 13th times the charm?) His work here is stunning whether the camera is capturing dust floating around a sunny room or framing the silhouettes of agents disappearing into the horizon at dusk as if theyre being swallowed whole by the land. If ""Sicario"" falters its only in its attempt to be more than a thriller. Villeneuves movies occupy a spectrum between thought-provoking and mind-bending and its clear that he wants to guide Taylor Sheridans script into similar territory. The movie makes occasional detours away from Kate to show the everyday life of a Mexican police officer (Maximiliano Hernandez) at home with his wife and young son in Sonora. Inevitably that mans story and the main narrative will intersect. But the collision course isnt provocative enough to justify the diversion. The movie works best when it sticks with Kate whose fear is palpable and contagious. In the grim world of ""Sicario"" the life-or-death situation that she finds herself in may not be the most geopolitically shocking but it makes for electrifying drama. And sometimes thats enough. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the Texas city where Kate thinks shes going. Its El Paso not San Antonio. This story has been updated. R. At area theaters.

"Sicario review Sleek drug-cartel thriller - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Sicario review A sleek drug-cartel thriller Sicario Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP / Lionsgate Emily Blunt right plays an FBI agent involved in the battle against the U.S.-Mexican drug trade in ""Sicario."" Emily Blunt right plays an FBI agent involved in the battle against the U.S.-Mexican drug trade in ""Sicario."" (Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP / Lionsgate) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Slick suspenseful pulp set along the U.S./Mexico border. For a gripping documentary about the U.S./Mexico border the drug trade and a hornets nest of sociopolitical nightmares watch Matthew Heinemans ""Cartel Land.""For a commercial thriller on related themes ""Sicario"" will do. The first hour of this latest film from French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is sleek terrific pulp. The second half of ""Sicario"" (in Mexico slang for ""hitman"") settles for more conventional bloodshed and storytelling. Such films present a conundrum for any director with a semblance of a moral conscience How do you make a movie built upon a revenge scenario and deliver the killing while also suggesting that the carnage is pretty appalling?""Sicario"" opens just outside a suburban Phoenix home. An FBI raid is about to run into some serious opposition. The house belongs to a known Mexican drug lord. Agent Macer played with a haunted look and pristine technique by Emily Blunt bursts into a bedroom and in an eyeblink an armed thug takes his shot and misses and Macer shoots him dead. Another agent spies something behind the bullet-ridden drywall two dozen corpses artifacts of the cartels activities. More violence ensues.Macer is recruited to join a shadowy interdepartmental task force targeting the drug lord behind the drug lord. A CIA analyst played with witty arrogance by Josh Brolin explains to Macer that the idea is to ""dramatically overreact"" and show the Mexican cartel kingpins that dirty wars beget dirty wars. Benicio Del Toro is first seen on screen in the middle distance as Brolins character mentions his ""bird dog"" Alejandro. Del Toro plays this mercenary a man with his own murky history with the cartels. Sicario (Trailer) Trailer for Sicario (ScreenPlay) Trailer for Sicario (ScreenPlay) See more videos The most ruthlessly suspenseful sequence in ""Sicario"" is a dazzlingly staged and edited ambush at the Juarez/El Paso border crossing. A much quieter scene later on points to Villeneuves intelligent complication of our responses toward what happens. The scene in question places Brolin and Blunt in a long shot on a tarmac as Blunts Macer hears from her superior just how little her cohorts are playing by whats left of the rules. The way its handled here you have a welcome shot of ambiguity.""Sicario"" doesnt fall apart in its second half exactly but it does settle for less than it should. By design Macer remains a reactive presence a conduit though one dimension shy of a three-dimensional protagonist. As the Del Toro character closes in on his prey the movie narrows and becomes more predictable. Yet even in the opening FBI raid the behavior on screen feels real enough to matter. Villeneuves next project is a ""Blade Runner"" sequel starring Ryan Gosling. The directors finest hour to date remains ""Incendies"" (2010). ""Sicario"" boasts passages as fine and harrowing as any in that picture even with ""Sicarios"" script limitations and its vague odor of what might be called ""scuzz tourism"" following a longstanding tradition of Anglo protagonists tasting the rot south of the border. (The greatest scuzz-tourism movie ever Orson Welles ""Touch of Evil."")

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Sicario"" means hit man in Spanish. Its perfect for this lean brutal drug-war epic. Combining relentless action with the story of a woman confronting a corrupted system it hits with the staggering energy of a visceral kick in the guts -- causing a sensory recoil in every scene. From the start were entering a borderland heart of darkness. Phoenix FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) leads an armored hostage-rescue squad surging into a drug cartels safe house. The raid triggers a frenetic firefight with gunmen from the blood-bathed city of Juarez but that shootout is only the prelude. Her team discovers the hostages behind plasterboard walls dozens of butchered corpses sealed in plastic cling wrap. If you expect the shockwaves to end there youre too trusting. When the openings high-testosterone violence ends its final lap Macer showers a drizzle of blood running from her scalp down her stunned face. Filmgoers dazed by director Denis Villeneuves brilliant insidious film may feel the need to cleanse themselves as well. ""Sicario"" is the latest step in Villeneuves dramatic ascent following the kidnap thriller ""Prisoners."" It echoes themes from ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" weaving them into a heart-pounding meditation on the madness of war. This is unmistakably a report from the front line of a dirty battle a kinetic tapestry of brutality and lost morals and power corrupting. ""Sicario"" showcases three raw honest performances in an escalating battle of control and morality. Blunts Agent Macer is intrepid and strong-willed but frustrated after being pressured to volunteer for a secretive task force. Blunt has the most challenging character of her career as the audiences proxy. Shes frustrated and disoriented from the films opening acts struggling to follow the baffling rules of engagement for this endless turf war. That doesnt make the intrepid lead character weak it makes her human. Macer is recruited off the books by Matt (Josh Brolin) a charismatic ruthless good ol boy agent and his tight-lipped impassive South American adviser Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). The mysterious agents claim their force was formed to ""shake the tree and create chaos"" against the Sonora Cartel leader behind the Arizona massacre. They claim to be security contractors representing the Department of Defense and to want her for an operation in El Paso none of it factual. Before she can ask whats next Macer is drawn into an extradition raid into Mexico driving beneath bridges the cartel has draped with beheaded cadavers. The ride back becomes a manhunt on wheels that leaves the screaming-fast chases of the ""Fast and Furious"" movies in the dust. Lionsgate Josh Brolin center plays a ruthless agent who recruits Blunts character. If battling an enemy as merciless as this means a police force slides into wrongdoing itself what does that matter? The strategy of counterattack says legal and territorial boundaries dont apply. Nor does truth. Macers handlers tell her as little as Taylor Sheridans taut screenplay reveals to us at first. The loose narrative structure is designed to keep us on edge. ""Youre asking me how a watch works"" Alejandro tells her. ""For now just keep an eye on the time."" ""Sicario"" ticks like a bomb timer. The undercover activity moves ever deeper into murderous territory as Macers mission grows more brutal and sinister than she ever imagined. Rarely do you see a crime film with monumentality like this a drug-trade saga with a very dreamlike horror bred in its bones. The music by Johann Johannsson triggers anxiety through each step deeper into the inferno while the elegant beautifully calibrated visual imagery from Roger Deakins locks every character in an existential prison. A stunning sequence that puts the U.S. squad running across the cartels darkened underground shafts viewing the combat zone with green night vision eyewear or gray heat-sensing goggles is frightening beyond description. From its shattering opening scene to its stunning conclusion ""Sicario"" is a devastating sociopolitical horror show a dramatic rockslide designed to stun even seen-it-all moviegoers. Villeneuve has earned his next assignment filming the sequel to the classic ""Blade Runner."" He could film a chewing gum commercial that would give you nightmares. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Comments click to enlarge Sicario Recommended Rated R  121 minutes  2015 American action movies about the drug cartels (David Ayers Sabotage Oliver Stones Savages) have a high bar to clear unless they bring some greater understanding of the crisis their portrayal of the cartels barbarism seems like crass exploitation. This contribution to the subgenre is plenty violent but it delivers light as well as heat; longtime actor Taylor Sheridan making his debut as screenwriter diligently explores the murky waters where law enforcement merges with national security. Emily Blunt tough as nails plays an Arizona FBI agent whos recruited for an elite anticartel task force and soon realizes its a shadowy CIA operation; Josh Brolin is the smooth cowboy running the show who will stop at nothing to smash the criminal organization that hangs mutilated bodies from the bridges of Juarez. This is suspenseful stuff but hanging over the action is the pungent smell of social failure as the drug war turns both sides into monsters. With Benicio Del Toro. By J.R.

But in the handling of that story in the places it goes and the ways in which its filmed ""Sicario"" is impressive from beginning to end. It has a screenplay of freshness and audacity thats brought to life by a director who understands its every psychological undercurrent. We might hope this kind of thing would happen all the time but its rare. Denis Villeneuve knows what to emphasize and he knows how to create a mood simply through camera placement and movement. No scene in ""Sicario"" is merely functional. Nothing is tossed off. Within minutes maybe seconds the world of this film envelops you and theres no escaping it. The first hint that ""Sicario"" is something exceptional comes in the first sequence in which the FBI agent Kate (Emily Blunt) leads her team on a drug bust in Arizona. The sights and the perspectives are unexpected They dont come through the door. They make their entrance by bulldozing through a wall. And then the scene resolves in the discovery of horrors best left undescribed here. Director Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan are in harmony on the films essential point that the horrors depicted in ""Sicario"" are also horrors of the spirit. This is not good guys and bad guys warring over their conflicting interests. This about the outer reaches of human depravity and iniquity and how just witnessing the fruits of it can erode the soul. And the brilliance of ""Sicario"" is that it presents unspeakable things in a workaday way with no elevation to make sense of it all. Following the Arizona bust the young agent volunteers for a secret mission alongside a CIA operative (Josh Brolin) and a Mexican mystery man (Benicio Del Toro). But she is treated like a junior partner and isnt told anything. If you see the film notice how the placement of the camera emphasizes Kates perspective. She sits in the back of a room at a briefing and Villeneuve never brings the camera in for a close-up of the man conducting it. Villeneuve stays in the back with Kate who can barely follow along.

(Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP/Lionsgate via AP) Photo Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP Associated Press Sicario an exceptionally well-directed thriller 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Later she is on a private plane with Del Toro but Villeneuve never really gives us an establishing shot of the planes interior so that we feel at home in it. Instead he cuts from close-ups of Del Toro to close-ups of Blunt so that we feel Kates isolation and the close confinement of the small jet. From there theres a sequence in Juarez which mostly consists of the three main characters driving around with a fourth operative played by Jeffrey Donovan. Notice that Donovan never gets a close-up and we barely see his face because hes sitting in the front seat of the car and Kate is sitting in back. And notice also how that makes Donovans character more strange and compelling. The whole Juarez sequence -- a simple thing; they have to move a prisoner across the border to a U.S. facility -- is brilliant a study in compressed tension. If at any point in ""Sicario"" you feel lost dont worry about it. The movie is all about being lost and in any case all becomes clear eventually. The filmmakers take the conventional genre of a drug thriller to make an unconventional point -- or a feeling more than a point. The intention seems less to say something about the drug war than it is to show what people are capable of and to capture an emotional and psychological condition. If you get the feeling youve understood the movie. As for the actors they are everything they need to be but this one was the directors show all the way. They must have felt in very good hands.

EntertainmentMovies Sicario Emily Blunt plunges into a dark violent world Originally published September 24 2015 at 1205 am Updated September 26 2015 at 533 pm Emily Blunt plays an FBI agent who joins a covert mission targeting Mexican drug cartels in ""Sicario."" (Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP/AP) A review of ""Sicario"" Denis Villeneuves disturbing drama set in the world of law enforcement and Mexican drug cartels. Rating 3.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic So much of ""Sicario"" Denis Villeneuves disturbing drama set in the world of law enforcement and Mexican drug cartels (the title is the Mexican term for a hit man) takes place on Emily Blunts face. As hardworking FBI agent Kate Macer shes constantly pausing thinking figuring things out and Blunt lets us see the wheels turning as Kate carefully weighs and chooses her words. A lonely recent divorcee Kate pours herself into her work (shes based in Arizona on the Mexican border) and shes wound tighter than a villains smile; in one close-up gazing into a mirror you can see the tiny throb of her jaw twitching. Kates seen more than she wants to and more than the ""Sicario"" camera will show us; Villeneuve and masterful cinematographer Roger Deakins carefully control our gaze. The film begins on a devastating discovery of corpses hidden in the walls of a nondescript house near the border the work of a vicious cartel. Soon Kates selected to join a black-ops mission alongside a mysterious Colombian operative named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro chillingly present) and rogue FBI agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin breezily tense). Harrowing trips are made to Mexico City and back again (theres a sequence taking place at the border during gridlock shot from above thats an instant classic of action filmmaking); lives are lost; questions are asked but rarely answered. Johann Johannssons dronelike score slices into the air like a knife; the camera flies across the arid seared-out ground where it seems as if no life could flourish. Movie Review 1/2   Sicario with Emily Blunt Benicio Del Toro Josh Brolin Victor Garber Jon Bernthal Daniel Kaluuya. Directed by Denis Villeneuve from a screenplay by Taylor Sheridan. 122 minutes. Rated R for strong violence grisly images and language. Meridian Lincoln Square. Plunging us into this world of darkness and violence (at times quite literally with one late sequence shot in night-vision in a cartel tunnel) Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan give us the smart idealistic Kate as our guide; shes seen too much to be naive but cant quite leave her humanity behind as Alejandro and Graver have found the need to do. There are no rules and no reason in this world of death and revenge and we see it through Kates eyes fascinated repelled ultimately haunted. ""Youre not a wolf"" Alejandro reminds her near the end ""and this is a land of wolves now."" Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Movie review Sicario Article Tweet Richard Foreman Jr. Victor Garber and Emily Blunt in Sicario Sicario      (out of five) Director Denis Villeneuve Cast Emily Blunt Josh Brolin Benicio Del Toro Rated R (strong violence grisly images strong language) Running time 121 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Sep. 24 2015 Thursday Sep. 24 2015 Thursday Sep. 24 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve certainly isnt the first filmmaker to explore the morally nebulous terrain of the War on Drugs and its corrosive impact on life along our southern border. But he turns out to be one of the most effective in the tense violent and thought-provoking Sicario.The Spanish word sicario is Mexican slang for ""hitman"" and on the surface the film tells a simple story of the attempted dethroning of a drug kingpin the elusive Fausto Alarcon. But hes not just being pursued by a rival or the Mexican government. Hes also in the crosshairs of a secret U.S.-backed quasi-military force.By-the-book and no-nonsense Arizona FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) isnt quite sure what shes in for when shes picked for this hush-hush assignment. All she knows is that her new superior Matt (Josh Brolin) is kind of sketchy as are the guys shes now teamed with especially the brooding and volatile Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Her longtime FBI partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) warns her that somethings not right.Her suspicions are confirmed when a trip purportedly to El Paso turns into an illegal mission across the border in pursuit of Alarcon (Fort Worths Julio Cedillo). The longer the chase goes the more the line between good guys and bad guys evaporates in the heat of the Mexican desert. And no one -- not the American or Mexican governments not law enforcement on either side not Mexican citizens caught in the middle not Kate -- is left unsullied.The most tragic character is Silvio (Maximiliano Hernandez) a small-town Mexican cop whose parallel story at first seems disconnected from Kates. But his desire to earn a few bucks and not put his family at risk by offending Alarcons foot soldiers puts him on a collision course.Villeneuve has dealt with political and social issues before -- his 2010 film Incendies which was nominated for the foreign-language Oscar is partially set in the Middle East -- but he doesnt pound home the message. Working from a script by Taylor Sheridan he puts the viewer in Kates shoes where she is totally in the dark at first and then slowly realizes whats happening.He hasnt forgotten that hes making a thriller and hes made one thats both nerve-shatteringly suspenseful and thanks to noted cinematographer Roger Deakins gorgeous to watch. Its a step above his last film the less satisfying Prisoners with Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal.Here the cast is uniformly strong with Blunt good in Edge of Tomorrow last year really coming into her own as a woman in the maddening middle. And Del Toro is at his looming threatening best.Matthew Heinemans Cartel Land a lauded documentary from earlier this year about the drug war may be more powerful in dealing with the same subject simply because its the real deal. But Sicario is the next best thing. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Instead we pay for the secret and massively expensive infrastructure of people guns vehicles intelligence ugly buildings secured by ""perimeters"" and high-tech hardware seen in ""Sicario"" the gripping and ominous new drug-war thriller from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. If ""Sicario"" feels an awful lot (maybe too much) like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" with a North American setting thats because it poses the same set of questions How far should we go to protect our consumer paradise? And what are we actually protecting when we decide there are no rules?Oh and heres a valuable detour for those of you warming up your comment fingers on that topic Of course I read the recent Vice report on the extensive contacts between CIA officials and Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow the writer and director of ""Zero Dark Thirty."" I agree with ZDT critics that all that doesnt look great in retrospect - but not great for whom? Instead of flinging up your hands in horror follow the money and the logic. You dont have to like the movie or its perceived message but bear in mind that Boal is a veteran investigative reporter who knows how to work sources. Which side of that exchange was lavishing gifts on the other? Which side was spilling secrets and has wound up the object of an investigation? Does it look like Leon Panetta and the CIA were playing the filmmakers or more like the star-struck spooks got hustled?With ""Sicario"" (the title references a Mexican slang term for ""hitman"") Villeneuve has found a subject suited to his abundant gifts for showmanship tension and violence and also to his tendency to overcook the soup and then burn down the kitchen. His international breakthrough came with ""Incendies"" in 2010 a melodramatic potboiler veiled in art-film drag. That movie was positively restrained compared to his ludicrous American debut ""Prisoners"" featuring Jake Gyllenhaals twitchiest performance and Hugh Jackmans most vein-bulging which in both cases is really saying something. ""Sicario"" has its flaws including an implausibly wide-eyed FBI agent played by Emily Blunt who appears not to have noticed the altered trajectory of American law enforcement over the last 15 years or so. But overstating the insanity tragedy existential gloom and overall horror-movie ambiance of the drug war along our southern border is not among those flaws since thats almost impossible.No wait -- let me walk that back a little. ""Sicario"" is a queasy-making thrill ride through Dick Cheneys Theme Park on the Dark Side with an enjoyable cast headed by Blunt Josh Brolin as a bro-tastic but oddly sinister secret agent in flip-flops and Benicio Del Toro as a person of uncertain provenance (is he Mexican? Is he Colombian? Is he CIA?) who is approximately the scariest guy ever. Actor-turned-writer Taylor Sheridans canny screenplay walks that line between assuring us that all this manly murder and mayhem is Keeping Us Safe [TM] and that the whole thing is a gruesome catastrophe. But I found myself doing battle with the seductive atmosphere of amorality and the Trumpian allure of the permanent worst-case scenario from the opening images. Its not so much that ""Sicario"" endorses noxious policies as that it depicts a world where everything is terrible and nothing can be understood. (To be fair thats a worldview to which I am generally sympathetic.)When Agent Kate Macer (Blunt) and her team raid a suspected cartel house in suburban Phoenix they dont just find bodies - they find 42 bodies apparently people asphyxiated with plastic bags and entombed in the walls. When Kate crosses the border into Ciudad Juarez with an ""interagency task force"" headed by cheerful and devious Matt (Brolin) the place looks more like Fallujah at the height of the Iraqi insurgency than like a city where 1.5 million people lead reasonably normal lives. (Yeah Juarez has a scary reputation and a significant violent crime problem. So bad that its murder rate is only slightly lower than that of St. Louis or Detroit and about the same as New Orleans.) You Might Also Like If you dont pay attention to facts when it comes to murder rates and the drug war and border issues - and hardly anyone does as Donald Trumps campaign has established - then its easy to assume that Villeneuve and Sheridan are depicting harsh reality rather than attacking our collective limbic system with a pileup of nightmarish images. It may be gratifying in a certain sense to believe that suburbia is full of tract homes stuffed with dozens of dead Mexicans or that major Latin American cities have degenerated into total carnage and chaos. If thats the way the world is as Matt keeps telling Kate in his jovial tough-love sermons then we cant afford to be overly concerned with the legality of the methods we use to maintain order or the moral quality of the weapons we employ.Now Ive talked myself all the way around to a visceral distaste for ""Sicario"" and its implied worldview. But that might not be fair either because this movie constantly hedges its moral bets and at any rate there is no disputing its ingenuity its technical excellence (with cinematography by the estimable Roger Deakins) and its mounting atmosphere of dread. Del Toros mysterious character Alejandro is a diabolical figure of destiny somewhat akin to the moptop madman played by Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"" while Brolins blend of brutality and bonhomie is straight out of an off-kilter spy novel by Denis Johnson or Don DeLillo. Im more than half inclined to see the internal racial and gender coding of ""Sicario"" as no accident Kate and her African-American FBI partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) play the innocent Little Red Riding Hood figures among these wolves repeatedly and curiously outraged to learn that double agents and special-ops forces and shadowy mercenaries are not observing jurisdictional regulations or filling out the appropriate forms in triplicate. Villeneuve handles action scenes with impressive flair but also understands that the key to effective action is to build up to it slowly and inexorably. He also knows the Stephen King trick of escalating the tension by giving something away in advance Going into the mission to extract a captured drug lord from Juarez we are told repeatedly that the cartels counterstrike will come when the convoy tries to cross the bridge back to El Paso. Thats entirely true but only makes the traffic jam at the border crossing more excruciating. What ends do the expertly managed action and suspense of ""Sicario"" serve beyond building a rather conventional multi-stranded ""Babel""/""Traffic"" narrative of interconnected human tragedy? Who is the hitman of the title and who sent him on his deadly mission? Beneath its moral spaghetti tangle and its deliberate obfuscation ""Sicario"" almost suggests an answer. But as we look in the mirror are we supposed to congratulate ourselves or feel ashamed? Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"Review Sicario an intense gritty look at the drug wars - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Sicario an intense gritty look at the drug warsBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 09/23/2015 120000 PM PDTUpdated 09/23/2015 062557 PM PDT At one point in ""Sicario"" Benicio Del Toros darkly enigmatic character Alejandro tells Emily Blunts tough by-the-book FBI agent Kate Macer that the Mexican border area where violent drug wars are fought daily is now a land of wolves and shes no wolf.""Wolves"" may be putting it lightly.""Sicario"" (which is a Mexican term for ""hitman"") is a stylistically abrupt story about the lengths to which America will go to stop the Mexican drug cartels that make machine gun fire and corpses in the street just another traffic barrier in the cities just south of the border. The film does a superb job of showing instead of telling how a joint task force made up of a number of government agencies -- some with whom Kate isnt aware shes working -- swiftly and violently deal with drug operations moving into the United States. She quickly learns rules are no longer rules and ""fight fire with fire"" is the supposed good guys new approach. Emily Blunt as Kate Macer in ""Sicario"" (Richard Foreman Jr./Lionsgate) Its rarely clear who the bad guys even are something Kate only comes to realize after being attached to the unit for reasons of which shes not fully aware until late in the story.We first see Kate leading an FBI unit in Arizona focusing on one of the cartels favorite methods of leverage kidnapping. After handling a nasty takedown that leaves two team members dead Kate is brought into a joint task force led by Matt (a typically great Josh Brolin who looks smugly comfortable in the role). Matt claims to be attached to the Department of Justice and committed to taking the fight to the cartels. ""To dramatically overreact"" he says smiling when Kate asks him about the teams objective.Hes not kidding. Advertisement The task force -- which includes Delta Force operatives who arent supposed to operate on American soil -- is initially challenged to get in and out of Mexico ASAP with a captured drug lord. A sequence of intense scenes is fast and desperate as the question isnt whether the U.S. forces will be attacked but from which direction. They use the prisoner to get to another link and to ultimately get to the cartels top dog. Doing so involves a claustrophobic action scene set in a smuggling tunnel a key point during which truths are revealed seemingly forcing Kate to make a decision. Director Denis Villeneuve delivers screenwriter Taylor Sheridans story layer by layer never overwhelming the audience while still challenging it to pay attention. While its not a fun movie to watch the story is delivered in a dazzling package thanks to sweeping aerial shots of the desert and border cities combined with sparse intense background music from Johann Johannsson (""The Theory of Everything""). The cinematography makes the dusty close-ups and violent action even more stark.Blunt whos carving out a niche for herself as todays go-to female action figure loses herself in her character -- a professional who recognizes shes being used and tries despite growing skepticism to keep her thinning idealistic streak alive. The only problem I had was the lack of explanation as to how such a dedicated smart capable and -- yes attractive -- woman decides to throw herself into a profession that seemingly makes her miserable. Its not meant to be a sexist question -- just a real one. I wanted to know if there was something beyond just basic values motivating her.Eventually we find theres no such ambivalence about the aloof Alejandro. Del Toro delivers the films wild card and most fascinating character. His origins and motives arent always clear and combined with his below-the-surface fury and comfort with violence he brings nervous electricity to every scene hes in. When he finally erupts its a display thats both tragic and tragically typical of the ugly drug wars ""Sicario"" portrays. Like so many great films a grim acceptance takes hold at some point making it clear that despite the best efforts of both sides nothing will change. Like Alejandro says only wolves can fight wolves and ""Sicario"" seems to argue there arent enough on the right side of this particular battle.

Photo Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP/Courtesy of Lionsgate Top-billed Emily Blunt in combat apparel stands in the foreground of the poster for Sicario looking oddly pensive but still very much like the hero of a balls-out military drug-bust thriller. Well she is and she isnt. The foreground of the story is murky oblique the shadowy aftermath of decisions made somewhere else based on events that have unfolded over decades. The drug busts seem strangely irrelevant. Theres no clear military hierarchy. Blunts character an FBI agent named Kate Macer isnt even the title figure sicario coming from an old Latin word for assassin resurrected by the new Latin American mafia. Denis Villeneuves film turns out to be a stupendously unnerving descent into moral chaos our presumed action hero Alice in Cartel-land. You could take Sicario as a corrective to Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boals Zero Dark Thirty that brilliant morally reprehensible female-led thriller that boiled down -- Bigelows subsequent obfuscations notwithstanding -- to the idea that going over to the ""dark side"" was the only way to win the War on Terror. Having had a few more decades to prove itself unwinnable (partly thanks to Americans ceaseless drive to be Anywhere But Here) the War on Drugs makes for an even starker prism through which to view the handshakes with the devil that are the running theme of U.S. foreign policy. Working from a script by Taylor Sheridan Villeneuve puts the emphasis on dead families dead children. The movie is a diagram of human suffering spread over the whole of the Americas. Sicario opens in bloody confusion with a thunderous assault on a compound said to be packed with drug-war hostages. Still shaking from the subsequent horror Kate is recruited into an elite force overseen by a cryptic agent called Matt (Josh Brolin). To whom does Matt answer? Funny you should ask. Its what Kate keeps asking too along with ""Whats the objective of our mission?"" She finds herself smack on the Mexican border -- in El Paso the relatively quiet little city from which you can watch parts of nearby Juarez blow up like Beirut in the 80s. Directed to make noise call attention to themselves ""shake the tree"" Kate and her team hurtle back and forth across the Bridge of the Americas apparently breaking domestic and international laws. What the hell are they doing? And who is the man called Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) who sits in planes and armored vehicles in silence staring at nothing? As Kate realizes that shes more a witness than participant Blunt does more and more with her eyes her open mouth her body that starts going one way -- its muscles trained to obey -- while her mind tries to intervene with a stop whoa what the fuck. Its a beautifully reactive performance abetted by Daniel Kaluuya as a brotherly FBI compadre. Around her Villeneuve the great Expressionist cinematographer Roger Deakins and the vigorously dissonant composer Johann Johannsson create a scrambled alien world in which harsh-lit desert landscapes give way to black tunnels. When Kate descends into one Johannsson comes up with a noise thats like the Earth giving up a final groan. Before that was what sounded like the keening of lost souls -- fuzzed out leaving the planet for somewhere better. The Quebec-born Villeneuve hates violence on a level so visceral he mourns his own images. He doesnt show as much as he did in his 2010 film Incendies which was partially set in an unnamed Mideast country much like Lebanon. But every road out of the frame leads to hell. A subplot centers on the young Mexican son of a man who comes and goes palpably treasuring breakfast with his family while pouring liquor into his coffee the fathers face inexplicably a mask of dread. In small and large (but rarely sensationalized) sounds and sights Villeneuve evokes a Mexico that -- since overtaking Colombia as the dominant player in Latin American terror -- is no country for old or young men or women or children. The lens of Sicario finally settles on Del Toro whose sad heavy eyes dont prepare us for the swiftness of his brutality. Theres something childlike about Blunts Kate a hint of a family man (and a bad boy) in Brolins Matt but anything naive and hopeful in Alejandro was incinerated long ago. I have no way of knowing if the alliance at the heart of Sicario has a basis in reality but history is lousy with examples of the U.S. befriending enemies of our enemies -- an improvisatory opportunistic tragically shortsighted geometry that has come to be seen as Realpolitik. By the end of the movie Villeneuve has us knotted up with dread while at the same time unsure what were dreading. The failure of this mission would be hard to live with but its success is the opposite of a design for living. What keeps Sicario from cynicism is the nature and depth of Villeneuves gaze not childishly wide-eyed but capable still of feeling pain. Hes a terrific director. You know that if his heroine Alice gets out of Cartel-land alive she might spend a few months in an asylum but shell be back hell-bent on seizing the foreground.

"Mob Deep Johnny Depps Black Mass and Climbing Everest << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Mob Deep Johnny Depps Black Mass and Climbing Everest Warner Bros. Movies September 18 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print I dont know what a murderous crime lord is supposed to look like but its not Johnny Depp. Can Depp be delicate? Yes. Frisky? Melancholy? Sure. Likely to enter an outdoor parking lot near the Boston Harbor with a shotgun and fire until two men are very dead? I dont think so. The makers of Black Mass seem to understand that theyve got a prettiness problem with Depp. They also want to be careful that in dramatizing the dirty doings of James ""Whitey"" Bulger they dont romanticize him. To that end theyve given Depp pale skin tight enough that it could flake at the merest expression of much beyond menace. Bulgers thinned hair has been slicked back into a shell and his crooked teeth appear to cast shadows on themselves. When he laughs -- barely half a hand is required to count the times -- youre staring into a cave. The color has even left his eyes. When the light catches them they sparkle like fish scales. Despite recent evidence to the contrary -- think junk like Transcendence and Mortdecai -- Depp isnt an ""I just sent you a fax"" sort of actor. But the movie doesnt take any chances; it makes Bulgers monstrosity literal. He looks like a supervillain who never got to finish transitioning to evil. Bulger was apparently a psychopath but he didnt look like he was ready to wreak havoc in Avengers 6. But the hair and makeup are smart. Theyre used to set apart the bad from both the worst and everyone else. One evening not far into the movie Whitey pays a visit to his little old Irish lady of a mother (Mary Klug). They play gin and his younger brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) a state senator is there cooking her dinner. Youre searching the dining room for some sign of resemblance among these three and there is none. Cumberbatchs clammy but attentive beauty has nothing to do with the talking corpse at the head of the table. That doesnt feel accidental. Neither does the conception of Bulgers two closest henchmen Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane) who here is rotund and baleful and Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) whos got prosthetic-looking skin big hair and a dogs loyalty. They could be in Abbott and Costello Meet the Wolf Man. The movie focuses on the years Bulger worked as an FBI informant from the mid-1970s until he fled Boston in the mid-1990s. A slickster agent named John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) seduces him into the role. At the time the feds wanted to rid the city of the Italian mafia and Connolly sells his reluctant bosses -- one is Charles McGuire played inevitably by Kevin Bacon -- on Bulger. A happy (and not entirely accidental) consequence of these consultations for Bulger was that the demise of the Italian mob cleared a path for his Winter Hill Gang to dominate not only the vending-machine racket but to run drugs and arms too. Connolly and another agent John Morris (David Harbour) reap the most intimate spoils in money and trips and time with Whitey but you get the sense that the men are just two prominent for-examples of corruption within the agency. As the years pass theres comedy in McGuires flipping his lid whenever he wants to bring charges against the Winter Hill guys but realizes he cant because Bulgers protected. Theres more in Connollys almost adolescent prevaricating about the turpitude of his source. I have to say the acting here is much stronger and more soulful than I would have expected and not only from Depp. Hes played so many of these walking zombies that its surprising hes found yet another way to do it the daylight bogeyman. Hes not out for sympathy. People blanched after a premiere screening in Boston this week when Depp tried to make what sounded like a case for Bulgers humanity. And that may be how Depp got through this part but whats onscreen is cold-blooded. Flemmi was as brutal as Bulger but I really like what Cochrane does with his body here. One of the darkest moments involves Bulger strangling to death someone Flemmi claims to care about. When its over Bulger makes Flemmi and Weeks dispose of the body and Cochrane darkens Flemmis demeanor which was never bright to begin with. Theres a part for Peter Sarsgaard as the sort of jittery disposable two-bit crook these movies always cough up. Sarsgaard is among the last actors youd cast in a part that requires him to say ""I make my living in the streets."" But hes so wrong that hes almost right. Meanwhile the women here have nothing to do but hang around houses and hospitals. But Dakota Johnson Juno Temple and especially Julianne Nicholson -- as a baby mama floozie-junkie and a long-suffering FBI wife respectively -- apply themselves to thankless canned roles of actual people. (Nicholsons accent works but like spoken palimpsest; as U.S. attorney Fred Wyshak Corey Stolls suggests a 51st state only he knows about.) Edgertons physicality takes the movie. When hes strutting and strolling around the office or virtually floating to heaven as a cluster of agents sit in a conference room listening to a mafioso incriminate himself or speaking in a treble accent that exists in Boston but that Ive never heard in a movie because the degree of difficulty is high its like hes inventing some new kind of machismo. Hes a bull-cock. Who knows where he found that accent (hes from Australia) but hes found one of the most entertaining performances Ive seen all year. And more than anyone else in Black Mass hes free to stay on a cloud since the movies depiction of Connollys employer is nothing short of scathing. The coolness and detached sense of horror that director Scott Cooper furnishes comes right from the source material the 2000 book Black Mass The Irish Mob the FBI and a Devils Deal by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill two former reporters for the Boston Globe. Most of the lighting is sepulchral and the pacing is funereal. Death is just about everywhere in this version of Boston which makes it close to almost every version of Boston filmed in the past dozen years. (The Heats an exception; its also a law-enforcement comedy.) The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi keeps its head lurking slowly to and fro. This is a leap forward for Cooper whose last movie was 2013s Out of the Furnace a testosterone-soaked tour de force of working-class phoniness. Hes decided to be a stylist -- which is something to be grateful for -- but Out of the Furnace was full of bad style. This time the declarative script which has been credited to Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk keeps the film on a moral tether. Theres only so far over the top his shotmaking can go before things turn glamorous before all of the allusions start rushing in. All the slow motion tracking moves and framing and wide and long shots are hauntingly descriptive In that strangulation sequence a shot in an apartment hallway with Bulger and his victim in the foreground slowly accommodates in the background one out-of-focus henchman then another. Takayanagi wants you to feel the sin. If youre going to dance with the devil the tune had better be a dirge.  Lionsgate It takes real balls to open your gangster movie in the same month that Martin Scorseses Goodfellas turns 25. But the sense of consequence of doom in Black Mass rebukes the high voltage and fun of Scorseses movie which is still an achievement of rhythm and tone. The camerawork and editing and framing still zing. The violence still shocks and time hasnt diminished the dread say of watching Karen Hill experience deep second thoughts about walking into an alley for a free coat -- no director has been more attuned to the importance of unnatural cinematic beats for even the possibility of murder. Even when you can anticipate a gun to the skull or a bag over the head youre surprised anyway. The movie remains this tremendous living breathing organism a fireman who turns out to be a stripper a jack springing from his box yeast. Its a classic but a distastefully besotted one. I could watch it every day of my life and thats not not a problem. Its unassailable as pop art but somewhat indefensible as a love story between a director and organized crime. But the level of stress at which this movie operates has never been topped by any crime opus and becomes its own form of caution. The movies legacy lingers quietly in some of the visual devices in Black Mass and boastfully shamefully on something like Narcos a show about the DEA and the Medellin cartel that began streaming last month on Netflix. Scorseses trapeze acts are tough to follow. Very few directors move the way he still can. He swings and pirouettes. Denis Villeneuve who also has a drug-war movie (Sicario) opening today pumps iron. Villeneuves movie is set on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border and tells the story of an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) whos been recruited by a beachy government asshole (Josh Brolin note-perfect) to help bring down a drug lord. On their side is a former prosecutor from Ciudad Juarez (Benicio Del Toro). Naturally the lady agent drowns in the moral murk while the dudes never lose sight of how the game is played. Looking like a man who has let go of himself as a survival tactic Del Toro really scares you. Hes got a speech at the end that points to the better movie this could have been. Aside from that performance and Roger Deakinss cinematography which is full of desert sizzle and searchlight-generated shadow Im not buying this movie; and Ive seen it twice. Mostly because Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan arent selling more than a tautological action movie with the dread and body count of a horror film. A friend and I were just saying about Villeneuve the other day that he really doesnt care what hes directing as long as it shows off his abs.  Universal Pictures Thats almost true of Baltasar Kormakur but he also seems capable of yoga or Krav Maga. Hes directed Everest which also opens today. (People the gym is crowded this week) Hes from Iceland and his Hollywood action thrillers include the enjoyably nasty Contraband and the proudly cynical 2 Guns. Written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy the movies based on the 1996 disaster at Mount Everest and was shot in 3-D and is worth seeing in that format. It puts you dizzyingly close to impossible vistas but also right beside staggering death. It has a cast that operates at just the right levels of starriness to be credible. Brolin John Hawkes Naoko Mori and Michael Kelly playing the journalist Jon Krakauer whose bestseller Into Thin Air was based on this trip are the civilian climbers. Jason Clarke is the New Zealander Rob Hall whose company is leading them up the mountain. Sam Worthington and Martin Henderson work with him. Emily Watson runs the base camp; Elizabeth Debicki is by her side as the camps physician. Jake Gyllenhaal is the hotdog leader of a rival expedition group and he acts with less mustard relish and sauerkraut than youd predict. And on wife duty are Keira Knightley (for Clarke) Down Under and in Texas Robin Wright (for Brolin). Knightleys character is pregnant. Wright wears some of the most atrocious clothes youre ever going to see -- even for mid-90s Texas. The film devotes the first half to preparation for the climb and most of the second to the disaster. Throughout the filmmakers keep you aware of the elevation and the time of day and how much reaching the summit means for the civilian climbers. Mick Audsleys editing proves as crucial to your absorption as what the daring cinematographer Salvatore Totino and the stunt and effects teams come up with. The toggling between the base and various points along the way to the summit becomes stressful then heartbreaking. Macho-ness doesnt preoccupy Kormakurs two other American films as much as money and the criminal motivation to acquire and spend it. Motivation starts to matter here just less crudely and more majestically. Within 30 minutes of everyone meeting each other and sharing their stories I became fascinated by what could have drawn them up there. Krakauer even asks this one night before things turn grim and never receives a truly satisfying answer. Kormakur makes you feel the existential wonder relentless risk and spiritual exaltation of the climb. When one character gets a hand on the summits peak he doesnt want to leave. Hes done something close to impossible and achieving that might be better than living to tell people you did. But I left feeling a Werner Herzog kind of churlish. Failure always feels inexorable in this movie and the mystical touches toward the end suggest that Kormakur doesnt disagree. Nature never loses.

"Tension crackles across the many borders of Sicario - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Tension crackles across the many borders of Sicario Review Tension crackles across the many borders of Sicario Richard Foreman / Lionsgate Benicio Del Toro stars in ""Sicario."" Benicio Del Toro stars in ""Sicario."" (Richard Foreman / Lionsgate) Mark OlsenContact Reporter The border between the United States and Mexico has been interjected into the national conversation as a literal thing -- a line where a wall can be built. But in the new film ""Sicario"" the border is more conceptual than that a zone of anxiety and often violent transformation.A title card at the beginning of the film announces ""In Mexico Sicario means hit man"" setting an immediate tone of ominous danger. Directed by Denis Villeneuve from a script by Taylor Sheridan the film manages to somehow be sleek and sprawling focused and cagey at the same time often in the same scene. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;The film portrays the so-called war on drugs not as a battle to be won but as an existential minefield something that sucks in people with even the best of intentions and turns their world inside-out. With a central trio of powerful deeply rooted performances by Emily Blunt Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin the film is both a bracing action picture and a startling examination of a world in which right or wrong have become essentially irrelevant. There is only survival and forward motion. Kate Macer (Blunt) is an FBI agent assigned to tracking down kidnapping victims of Mexican drug cartels in the American Southwest. Early on it is suggested that she volunteer -- she cant be officially assigned she must volunteer -- for an interagency joint task force. She joins in hopes of making a bigger difference and quickly finds out nothing is as she was told it would be.

Alejandro (Del Toro) is introduced first by Graver as a ""bird dog"" but reveals himself to be much more than that.Moving freely back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico the trio are trying to disrupt the flow of money and drugs in hopes of causing higher-ups in the Mexican cartel to make a mistake and reveal themselves.Sheridans script seems to purposefully keep Mexico and its people at arms length largely an abstraction. A series of scenes involving a Mexican cop and his family feel architectural there for reasons of structure and a passing consideration rather than organic to the storytelling. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The film is elevated most by its performances. Blunt who handily stole last years Tom Cruise action vehicle ""Edge of Tomorrow"" from its star again proves herself as one of the most versatile and compelling actresses today. Here she shapes her character as something of a modern-day Clarice Starling from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" an initiate to a world far removed from the one she trained for yet capable of adapting to its unfamiliar ways.Though an Oscar-winner for ""Traffic"" a film to which ""Sicario"" bears some comparison Del Toro remains less a conventional star than a transformative actors actor and here he brings his full eccentric soulful commanding presence. He credibly creates a character who can shoot someone and still seem sympathetic both to that character and the audience.With a wicked manic charm Brolins character declares his mission to be simply to ""create chaos"" hoping to disturb the finely honed machinery of the drug trade just enough to cause gears to slip and panicked mistakes to be made. Villenueves economic storytelling conveys much about the character with a simple pan down to reveal Brolin sitting at a conference table in a soulless government office wearing flip-flops.The films most hair-raising set piece occurs when a convoy of SUVs becomes stuck in traffic at the border crossing on its return to the U.S. from a visit to Juarez moving targets made still. Ratcheted by a tortuous tension and sense that danger is possible on all sides it is among the best action scenes of the year -- and the cars are at a standstill.Special notice must go to cinematographer Roger Deakins whose work on Villeneuves previous film ""Prisoners"" counted for one of his 12 Oscar nominations. Here Deakins captures the daybreak/sundown slippage between light and dark with frequent shots of a sky transitioning from shadowy blue to a tangy orange. In one moment he perfectly frames a character walking into a tunnel backlit against the opening effectively making a spotlight for a drawn knife that seems to be heading straight for the viewer.A subsequent shootout seamlessly weaves between night-vision thermal images and a conventional view aided immeasurably by editor Joe Walker. The films score by Johann Johannsson creates a throbbing underlying tightness throughout.By turns thrilling disorienting and draining ""Sicario"" exists in a border zone seemingly of its own devising between the art film and the action movie. This is definitely not a film that pretends to have any answers and suggests its a struggle to even fully understand what the right questions might be.Shortly after they first meet Kate asks Alejandro for details of their assignment. ""Youre asking me how a watch works. For now just keep an eye on the time"" he responds enigmatically. By the end of the film she will understand how the system works in that its dysfunction and conflicting interests is no system at all.Twitter IndieFocus------------SicarioRated R for strong violence grisly images and languageRunning time 2 hours and 1 minutePlaying Limited release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Mexico Benicio Del Toro Josh Brolin Tom Cruise Celebrity Portraits by The Times Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-0918-sicario-review-20150918-story.html,200,sicario24,sicario,latimes

""Sicario"" which combines dizzying action scenes with a taut script ravishing photography and an otherwordly musical score is a knockout film from Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve who propelled himself into the front rank of directors with the harrowing 2013 kidnapping drama ""Prisoners."" ""Sicario"" which begins with a helicopter inviting itself into a house is equal parts an action saga and a tough-minded drama about power -- ultimately the indefatigable force that is drug addiction. Kate (Blunt) who busts down doors in Arizona for the FBI is casually recruited by Brolins Matt a ""DoD adviser"" which is what you call yourself when youre CIA. Josh BrolinPhoto Handout She is a superfluous presence on his all-star team of grizzled operatives plus he wont even tell her what her new colleagues are up to. A mission in ""the El Paso area"" turns out to mean a sojourn to Mexico to kidnap the brother of a drug lord so he can be tortured into giving up the location of a secret tunnel across the border. Matts top aide (Benicio del Toro) describes himself as a former Mexican prosecutor who also has ties to Medellin Colombia. ""Nothing will make sense to your American eyes and you will doubt everything we do"" he advises her. ""But in the end you will understand."" Villeneuve cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer Johann Johannsson combine to make the action scenes gorgeous scary and exciting while the script by Taylor Sheridan is mordant and smart with not a wasted word. Its unfortunate that Blunts character -- by-the-books married to her job -- is underdeveloped but she is such a determined presence that you may not notice. Great as she is though Del Toro coiled as a cobra is even better while Brolin -- merry and lethal a warrior in flipflops -- is my favorite of the lot. ""Sicario"" (""hit man"" in Spanish) is like a fixed-up version of 2013s ""The Counselor"" a film with both merits and flaws galore and it like ""Traffic"" and ""Chinatown"" elegantly carries the grim burden of knowing that in its world there is no triumph no solution no redemption. As Del Toro puts it ""This is a land of wolves now.""

Director Denis Villeneuve (201). R Violence. Area theaters. FIND SOMETHING to grip when you watch ""Sicario"" -- this dramatic thriller finds a spot somewhere between your brain and your stomach and drills in. Thats not surprising given that its a Denis Villeneuve film (""Incendies"" ""Prisoners""). But there are plenty of surprises even in a genre we know well. FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) has just happened upon a house full of corpses in Arizona the work of Mexican drug cartels. Shes approached by a Department of Defense consultant named Matt (Josh Brolin) and an associate of his named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) to join them to bring down the cartels on the U.S.-Mexico border -- and deeper than that get the kingpins. Kate isnt lied to by Matt and Alejandro but she isnt privy to all their intel either. They have an agenda and need her as an FBI contact along for the ride. But the ride gets bumpy then deadly and soon Kate a steely precise officer isnt sure who to trust and what to trust them about. Blunt is extraordinary here in a role reminiscent of Gene Hackmans Popeye Doyle in ""The French Connection"" -- shes relatable to us and involved in something far bigger than she suspects. Del Toro is similarly mesmerizing using his height and his intensity to make Alejandro -- who has a tragic backstory -- larger than life. In a crucial concluding scene you cant take our eyes off of him. Brolin always welcome is in many ways the bridge between them. His character wears his American insouciance like a bulletproof vest. Matt shows up at important meetings wearing flip-flops and with his blood pressure several ticks below what youd expect. But thats part of what has kept him alive this long. ""Sicario"" -- the title is a name for Latin American hitmen -- is photographed by the great Roger Deakins (""No Country for Old Men"" ""Skyfall"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"") and it veers visually between parched exteriors and interior scenes that feel deliberately airless. Among several stellar moments is a chase in a tunnel and a nighttime car ambush that are beautiful in their simplicity and nerve-racking in execution. Villeneuve is known for sustaining tension in his films through long takes precision plotting and keeping an audience intimate with danger. Plot-wise there may be a set piece or two that feels familiar but ""Sicario"" stands apart.

As such both movies will wind up in someones doctoral thesis about post-Osama Bin Laden cinema but of the two its ""Sicario"" thats more effective as both a thriller and an examination of the shaky morality that can exist within supposedly noble efforts. Starring as FBI agent Kate Macer Emily Blunt serves not only as our conduit into the darker reaches of the drug war but also as our moral compass; she may wind up going to the wrong places but its always for what seems to be the right reasons. As the film opens Kate and her team including her work partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya ""Kick Ass 2"") storm a house in a seemingly generic Arizona subdivision only to make some truly horrifying discoveries behind the drywall plus a lethal booby-trap in the outside shed. See Video Emily Blunt Josh Brolin Take on Mexican Drug Cartels in New Sicario Trailer Determined to take down the kingpin behind this house of horrors Kate allows herself to be talked into joining a governmental task force led by Matt (Josh Brolin) who claims to be a Department of Defense ""adviser"" but who clearly has shady connections and even shadier methodology when it comes to going after the bad guys. In no time Kates on a private jet to El Paso with Matt and another adviser known to most as ""Medellin"" (Benicio Del Toro). The screenplay by actor-turned-writer Taylor Sheridan keeps us as confused as Kate is giving us (and her) information in occasional dribs and drabs. Before she can get a handle on whats going on shes part of a squadron transferring a cartel higher-up from Juarez to the United States leading to one of the films many action centerpieces where a convoy of SUVs gets stuck at a bottleneck at the border and any seemingly random car in the traffic jam could be loaded with gun-crazy narcotraficantes. As Kate comes to understand the mission and why shes a part of it the ethics get sketchier and sketchier and ""Sicario"" (which the opening title cards tell us means ""hitman"") skillfully balances being a lean mean thriller while also saying something about the futility of the ongoing war on drugs. That its so suspenseful and propulsive comes as a bit of a surprise given that director Denis Villeneuve for all his obvious skill has been something of a cold fish behind the camera with previous outings like ""Prisoners"" and ""Enemy."" See Video Emily Blunt Takes Jimmy Kimmels Ultimate US Citizenship Test What Does MLB Stand for? Working once again with master cinematographer Roger Deakins Villeneuve isnt afraid to get grimy and intense here with unexpected bursts of violence interspersed throughout. (Deakins also shoots night-vision better than anyone else around; youve seen lots of green figures moving through the blurry darkness in other movies but never as vividly as he captures them here.) Also Read Emily Blunt Apologizes for Controversial Joke About Regretting US Citizenship (Video) Blunt makes an impression in a role that could have easily been a plot device; thanks to the actress empathy and Sheridans writing Kate emerges as a complex fascinating character and not the generic tough-lady that so many movies would offer. Moral ambiguity suits Brolin -- theres a moment where he whistles ""Hail to the Chief"" before water-boarding a cartel member and his turn as George W. Bush in Oliver Stones ""W."" leaps to mind -- and Del Toros quiet intensity provides the film with a palpable unease. (He does at times seem to be channeling Terrence Howards brand of squint-whisper-half-smile acting unless its Howard whos borrowing it from Del Toro of course.) ""Sicario"" calls to mind the films of the 1970s -- not necessarily the ones we think of as capital-I Important but the seamy sweaty thrillers that subtly slipped in anti-establishmentarian messages amid the violence. It mixes arthouse and grindhouse into a most satisfying cocktail. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners Incendies) working from a dense devastating script by Sons of Anarchy actor Taylor Sheridan is out to shatter your nerves. And does he ever.

The audience surrogate is definitely FBI field agent Kate Macer played by Emily Blunt in a powerhouse performance that ranks with the years best. Blunt proved she could kick ass in Edge of Tomorrow in which co-star Tom Cruise looked like a wuss by comparison. In Sicario Kate is damn near a woman alone. We first meet her in Arizona in a hideout run by a Mexican drug cartel with decomposing corpses stuffed in the walls. Nothing throws Kate till shes basically ordered to volunteer for an agency-merging task force that pits one drug lord (Bernardo Saracino) against another (Julio Cesar Cedillo). Confused? Just soak it up which is the advice Kate gets from operations chief Matt Graver (Josh Brolin smartass and stellar) a laid-back manipulator in sandals who claims to be working a defense contract but has the aura of CIA. His associate Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-Mexican-prosecutor-turned-assassin. Does Alejandro have a personal agenda? Look in his eyes. Del Toro who won an Oscar for Traffic is tremendous again here radiating a smoldering cool that throws the sexually unflappable Kate off her game. Sicario is a setup for scalding action in a world where right and wrong are no longer absolutes. As Kate tries to stand her moral ground while the ground keeps shifting Villeneuve stages one gut-wrenching scene after another set to a jittery jangling score by Johan Johannsson. And kudos to cinematographer Roger Deakins His aerial shots of a white-knuckle border crossing contrast vividly with a breathless chase through drug tunnels and he achieves visual miracles. Still its on Blunts expressive face that Sicario writes its darkest poetry. Prepare to be haunted for a good long time.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Like a lot of movies that use unfamiliar or foreign words as titles Sicario provides a definition right at the outset Its the Spanish word for ""hit man"" were informed. On the surface level that refers to a particular character in the film whose mission involves summarily executing a cartel kingpin; every twist and turn of the narrative is expressly designed to bring this assassin one step closer to his target. And a white-knuckle journey it is too--so relentlessly stressful that some viewers may require a deep massage afterward having spent two solid hours with their muscles tensed. Yet the true victim in (and of) Sicario is its protagonist who attempts to do the right thing at every turn and is rewarded by being systematically squeezed out of her own story. Its an uncommonly bold gambit expressly designed to frustrate people who want to see a strong woman deliver a righteous ass kicking. The progressivism here is instead rooted in futility and despair which provides much more of a valuable shock to the system.Initially Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is in complete control heading up a special FBI unit that deals with hostage situations. When her team raids a nondescript Arizona house and finds dozens of corpses sealed in the walls however shes invited by an alleged Department Of Defense ""consultant"" Matt (Josh Brolin) to join his inter-agency operation which seeks to destabilize the Mexican cartel responsible for the massacre. Told shell be flying to El Paso Kate is instead taken to Juarez just across the border for a highly dangerous extraction mission--just the first of numerous lies that Matt and his mysterious unaffiliated associate Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) will blithely toss at their new recruit when they bother to brief her at all. Kate meanwhile struggles to maintain her trust in the chain of command even as every ethical and honorable instinct she possesses--along with any semblance of due process--gets trampled and ignored. By the end her choice has become starkly binary play ball or commit suicide.When Sicario premiered at Cannes in May some critics dismissed it as just another drug-war yarn comparing it unfavorably to Steven Soderberghs Traffic. (Look for up-to-date Narcos references this week.) That may well have been what first-time screenwriter Taylor Sheridan--an actor best known for playing Deputy Chief David Hale on Sons Of Anarchy--had in mind but the final product turned out bigger and more resonant than that. Reportedly there was pressure from suits to make Kate a male role which the filmmakers wisely and stubbornly resisted. Ethan Hawke played a similarly befuddled idealist in Training Day so it certainly could have worked. Sicario however is less inclined to provide a cathartic climactic victory and watching its intensely admirable heroine (superbly embodied by Blunt who can seemingly do anything) gradually become all but irrelevant wouldnt boil the blood in the same way were she a dude. (Its likewise significant that Kates partner played by Daniel Kaluuya is African-American and so marginalized that Matt cant even remember his name.)Another common complaint circulated about Sicario at Cannes is that it demonizes Mexico and thats likely to gain traction now what with Donald Trump doing the same as a presidential candidate. Ironically the films least effective element is its effort not to do so by way of a minor Mexican ""bad guy"" whos rather studiously humanized over the course of the movie. Still at least the filmmakers tried and were clearly aware of the problem. In any case subversive intentions would mean very little if Sicario failed to deliver what it promises which is heart-pounding excitement. One can easily ignore the films ambitious subtext and enjoy it strictly on the basis of its terrific performances and nonstop intensity. Brolin as the cocksure Matt (who wears flip-flops to top-secret meetings) is hilariously yet frighteningly callous while Del Toro turns in his steeliest work since well Traffic. And while director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners Enemy) orchestrates multiple high-octane set pieces--the most harrowing is an ambush that takes place in a traffic jam at the U.S.-Mexico border crossing--he also manages to make ostensibly mundane establishing shots seem ominous. The tiny shadow of a plane viewed from above as it heads into Mexico carries almost as much weight as the muzzle of a gun placed under someones chin. In the end though it all comes down to Blunts Kate Macer and her inability to fulfill the role she seems to have been assigned by long-standing Hollywood convention. This is not a failing. Its the whole point.

He first gained real attention with ""Incendies"" a film about Mideast terrorism. Then came ""Prisoners"" with Hugh Jackman as a violent vigilante. And the very surreal ""Enemy"" which had Jake Gyllenhaal confronting a spooky doppelganger. Villeneuves new ""Sicario"" is no milder. Set on both sides of the U.S./Mexican border its a story about the drug war and its costs and begins with FBI agent Emily Blunt going on what she thinks is a hostage rescue. What she uncovers is a murder house stuffed with the bodies of cartel victims. So she volunteers - or really is volunteered - to represent the Bureau as part of a joint-task force organized to get the big drug boss. Josh Brolin is her new boss a civilian who still gives off a rough military presence. Benicio Del Toro is an even more mysterious aide bent on revenge - for his own purposes. But then no ones purposes are clear here. Blunts by-the-book agent isnt sure why shes been included on what seems like a paramilitary mission. Whats this got to do with the FBI? Shes eager to build cases and bring charges. Her new colleagues are ready to lock and load. Her confusion spills out a little into the movie itself. What exactly is the task forces purpose? ""Shake the tree"" Brolin says with a grin. ""Create chaos."" But occasionally that chaos extends into the movie itself just as Blunts own inaction - shes often left standing frozen while Brolin and boys go rogue - leaves her character marginalized. Thats one problem with the movie -- the men are so much more interesting than the one female character (whos there gender-typically to stand for thought while they embody action). Another problem is frankly the overwhelming negativity of the Latino characters. Del Toro is the closest thing we have to a hero here - and hes a torturer and barely reformed criminal. But if the film is a little too macho and far too Anglo to tell the full ugly story of all the villains and victims it is like all of Villeneuves films a bravura piece of filmmaking. The great cinematographer Roger Deakins delivers sweeping aerial views of desolate desert landscapes and a night-vision fight in a smugglers tunnel that evokes ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Johann Johannssons score rumbles and thumps like a dying animal. And then violence suddenly flashes out of nowhere sometimes happening offscreen - its a story where people are constantly and suddenly re-entering a scene with bloody noses and bullet wounds. Sometimes even quiet domestic scenes explode. People abruptly clash. Battles begin. The war goes on. And continues to go on. And on. And on. With casualties on every side and no clear victory in sight. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence strong language and substance abuse. Sicario (R) Lionsgate (121 min.) Directed by Denis Villeneuve. With Emily Blunt Josh Brolin Benicio Del Toro. Opens Friday in New York.    Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com.

"Sicario starring Emily Blunt reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Emily Blunt Stars in a Gruesome and Haunting Action Movie About the Drug War Emily Blunt Stars in a Gruesome and Haunting Action Movie About the Drug War Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 17 2015 1043 AM Sicario Director Denis Villeneuve gives the brutal violence of the intractable drug war the action-movie treatment. By Dana Stevens Emily Blunt as Kate Macer in Sicario. Photo courtesy Richard Foreman Jr./SMPSP/Lionsgate Sicario opens on a power chord of fear nausea and dread that resonates throughout the whole movie. After an introductory screen defining the title--its drug-cartel slang for hit man--the seventh feature film from Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies Prisoners Enemy) drops the viewer straight into the noise and chaos of a tense FBI raid on a cartel-owned house near Phoenix. The electronic soundtrack (by Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson) delivers a series of jolting sonic booms as a young field agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) leads her team to an unexpected and macabre discovery hidden in the walls of the house are dozens of decomposing bodies. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The raid turns up more than enough evidence to arrest the houses owner Manuel Diaz (Bernardo P. Saracino). But Kates Bureau bosses instruct her not to track down Diaz just yet. Matt (Josh Brolin) a wisecracking operative whose precise title and mission remain undisclosed wants to wait until Diaz gets called down to Juarez by the big boss (Julio Cedillo) so that the whole cartel can be dismantled from the inside. Kate a by-the-book type is uncomfortable with the idea of using one target as a lure to catch another not to mention suspicious of Matts apparent disregard for the potentially high body count his plan entails. That discomfort will give way to disgust after Kate volunteers for a team of federal and state agents headed south of the border to find a tunnel that allegedly leads directly to the kingpins highly fortified lair. And if Matts role in the operation seems veiled in mystery hes a poster child for transparency next to Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) a Mexican ex-prosecutor now working as a kind of freelance vigilante. Advertisement The world of Sicario--deliberately opaque law-enforcement officials vicious criminal bosses suspenseful desert raids filmed as if through night-vision goggles--is one weve seen onscreen a lot lately not only in movies and TV shows about the drug trade but in war stories about Iraq and Afghanistan. (Sicario brought to mind Zero Dark Thirty more than any other recent film.) But Villeneuve shows us that world with a stark urgency that makes the moral questions the movie poses feel vividly real. Sicarios plot isnt intricate or hard to follow--there are no clues to remember or puzzles to solve. Rather than a birds-eye procedural about a complex international mission its a close-up of that mission from the point of view of the participant who understands it the least. By the end I was as exhausted and tense as the increasingly hollow-eyed Kate. Kate wants to know why she a notoriously clean cop has been conscripted for a job this dirty. Meanwhile Alejandro who has his own motives for infiltrating the hideout keeps doing things that erase the distinction between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys""--terms both he and Matt throw around carelessly and with an alarming lack of introspection. Still Alejandro remains curiously protective of Kate whos been quite open about her willingness to blow the whistle on their whole murky operation. The shifting balance of power and knowledge among these three people--Kate Alejandro and Matt--is the dramatic core of Sicario but the screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (better known as Deputy Chief David Hale on TVs Sons of Anarchy) skimps on the kind of rich character development that might have made their characters feel more human. Of the three only Alejandro is given a trace of a backstory; Im not asking for flashbacks with lap dissolves and harps but where does Kate come from? Why did she divorce the ex-husband to whom she alludes in a single terse line? Does she ever I dont know watch TV in one of her various barren hotel rooms or give herself pep talks in the mirror while brushing her teeth? I know this is the age of tightlipped heroines with stoic thousand-yard stares--presumably these are the ""strong women"" people are always talking about needing more of in movies--but I would like to put in a word for action heroes male or female who let us get to know them a little better (aided by scripts that strive to understand who they are). Because Emily Blunt is Emily Blunt with a face that registers shifts of feeling so finely she could have been a great silent-movie actress Kate remains a person whose story (and constantly imperiled physical safety) the audience cares about. But with no sense of what conditions or experiences have made her into the morally scrupulous person she is the character stays flat Kate stands for the idea of good-copness in general rather than embodying a specific cop whos good (and bad) in her own specific way. Though Brolins character too could have used more meat on his bones the actor is both funny and enraging as the macho wiseass Matt while del Toro--who can sometimes lay it on a little thick for my taste--gives a beautifully judged performance in a potentially melodramatic part. With that unsettling electronic score and the elegant cinematography of legendary DP Roger Deakins (who has worked with Villeneuve before on Prisoners) Sicario sweeps the viewer up in its jagged menacing rhythm. Something violent is always either happening or definitely about to happen any moment and when it comes its usually even worse than you expected. The Mexican underworlds practice of mutilating and displaying its victims corpses both as trophies and deterrents to would-be double-crossers is frequently and graphically on display. The movies two-hour running time passed in a fevered rush leaving me as exhausted and tense as the increasingly hollow-eyed Kate. Top Comment Fun fact ""Sicario"" comes from the Latin ""sicarius"" ""daggerman.""  The sica was a Thracian knife single-edged and slightly curved. It was defined in Roman law as ""infamous"" as opposed to the soldiers straight double-edged pugio.  More... -John Roberts Join In Whatever Sicarios dramatic deficits no one could accuse it of being an oversimplified clean-up-the-streets thriller out to provide audiences with a quick fix of action-movie catharsis. This is the drug war as seen through a long lens with the moral and political intractability of the problem laid out as clearly as the road from El Paso to Juarez in a stunning aerial shot of the U.S.-Mexico border. Seen from that high the flat dusty expanse of land where the two countries meet and divide looks exactly the same on both sides. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Release DateSeptember 18 2015 Trailer http//www.sicariofilm.com/ Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - By Amy Nicholson In the last three years Mexicos murder rate has plummeted by a third. Alas Denis Villeneuves Sicario will give travel agents a headache. When naive FBI agent Kate (Emily Blunt) crosses the border her companion Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) growls ""Welcome to Juarez."" And how. Headless corpses dangle from highway overpasses; missing-person posters line the streets; machine guns shoot up traffic. From the sun-bleached shock-and-awe desert cinematography of an opening attack in Arizona Sicarios point is clear Our latest murky war is close to home. Both Villeneuve and his leading lady artlessly prosecute the cartels. Against the advice of world-wise Alejandro and his flippant partner Matt (Josh Brolin) she charges into crime scenes eager to book gangsters for any petty crime. The filmmaker signs the indictment with blood inserting montages of actual corpses and literally wallpapering a safe house with Mexican dead. Effective yes. But Villeneuves voiceless victims begin to smell especially when the film isnt much interested in them while alive save for a Sonoran cop who spends most of Sicario in what may as well be a separate movie. Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan views Mexico with a dystopian cynicism; its citizens cant save themselves and foreigners make things worse. I left the film sickened and scrambled much as I did Villeneuves previous films Prisoners and the double-Gyllenhaal head-scratcher Enemy. Villeneuves proven he has a strong punch. The trouble is he barely aims. With Blunt sidelined as the films angry clumsy conscience its left to Del Toro to rescue us with campy humor at one point torturing a druglord with a wet willie.

A title card at the beginning of the film gives two definitions for the word. The first refers to the zealots in ancient Jerusalem who hunted and killed the Roman invaders. The second and more to the point of this remarkable movie set along our countrys southwest border defines it as the Mexican word for ""hit man."" With that out of the way its best to prepare yourself for a buzz saw of mayhem that doesnt let up for the next 120 minutes. The movies bravura opening sequence is a marvel of action and exposition. Emily Blunt playing an FBI agent named Kate Macer who heads up a kidnap-response squad is leading a raid on a house in Chandler Arizona. She and her team are looking for hostages but after a chaotically tense shootout she discovers only dead bodies - rows and rows of them wrapped in plastic tarps and stacked upright behind the hideouts walls like ghoulish mummies. Who are these doomed souls? And whos behind this gruesome tableau of death? The answer comes soon enough when Kate is summoned to an intra-agency debriefing led by Josh Brolins flip-flop-wearing black ops cowboy. Sitting around the table are feds much higher on the government-clearance foodchain than her. Questions are asked of Kate but this is really a job interview. Is she interested in saddling up with Brolins covert operation to find the Mexican cartel kingpin responsible? Her answer is more or less ""When do I start?"" Brolins response is more or less ""You already have."" Like Steven Soderberghs sprawling 2000 war-on-drugs epic Traffic Sicario is a film about the hopelessness of the now. But rather than pull the camera back to explore the global reach of this scourge as Soderbergh did Villeneuve zooms in on one frontier the porous border between the U.S. and Mexico. The game plan of Brolins shadow agency is to lure a big fish named Manuel Diaz by kidnapping his brother from a Juarez jail bringing him back to the States and interrogating him in an ""enhanced"" fashion. This says Brolin will rattle Manuels cage and make him screw up enough that he can be caught. Villeneuves previous film was 2013s Prisoners a quieter and more interior meditation on violence and vengeance. As bleak and gripping as that film was Sicario feels even more assured. With an assist by the great cinematographer Roger Deakins Villeneuve stages Brolin and companys south-of-the-border bodysnatching with an almost sadistic level of suspense. As Brolin and Blunt speed in black SUVs through the streets of Juarez - a grim ghostland where naked corpses hang from overpasses as warnings to anyone thinking about going against the cartels - youre waiting for a timebomb to detonate. And its only after youve exhaled and fooled yourself into thinking youre safe that the explosion goes off. Another link to Traffic is the presence of Benicio Del Toro as a sleepy-eyed spectre named Alejandro. Alejandro used to be a prosecutor in a previous life but his role now in Brolins murky orbit is only revealed late in the game. Blunts Kate becomes the units - and Sicarios - conscience. Which is too bad for her because neither is really soliciting one. After all Brolin and Del Toro gave up the charade of playing by the rule of law long ago. Their M.O. is moral relativism. But Kates not so cavalier about scrapping right and wrong. Then again maybe she just hasnt spent enough time in Juarez. Blunt makes all of this play out on her face with subtly and nuance. Fans of the first half of her career when she was playing hilariously bitchy fashionistas and corseted love interests are only starting to get used to the idea of her as a can-do action heroine in movies like Sicario and last years Edge of Tomorrow. Shes a stony-faced badass with the cheekbones of a catwalk model. And even if Blunts Kate is written as a little too naive its hard to fault her performance. With a taut and timely screenplay by Taylor Sheridan Sicario is a brilliant action thriller with the smarts of a message movie. And the message is this Are we willing to bend the rules and sell our souls to fight a war that will probably never be won? Before you answer that question see this film.

Daily Edition Login to download Sicario Cannes Review 131 AM PDT 5/19/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A searing and superbly made drug cartel drama TWITTER Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin star in Denis Villeneuves thriller about the inter-American drug trade. The violence of the inter-American drug trade has served as the backdrop for any number of films for more than three decades but few have been as powerful and superbly made as Sicario. Drenched in many shades of ambiguity as it dramatizes a complex U.S.-led effort to take out a major Mexican drug lord south of the border Denis Villeneuves intensely physical new work is no less disturbing than his previous features Prisoners and Incendies and should be able to generate midlevel business akin to the former due to its relatable lawman (and law-woman) elements. After world premiering it in competition at the Cannes Film Festival Lionsgate will hold back the domestic commercial release until Sept. 18. An opening note explains that ""sicario"" is cartel slang for hitman derived from a term dating to ancient Jerusalem describing hunters of Romans. Loosely used its a word that could apply to almost every character in this tense tale which is not difficult to follow even if it does demand that close attention be paid. The script by first-time screenwriter Taylor Sheridan who played Deputy Hale on televisions Sons of Anarchy until the character was killed off at the beginning of the third season quickly establishes an environment in which everyone is capable of killing or being killed as well as a roster of characters for whom the labels ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" are so relative as to essentially become irrelevant. See more Cannes The Red-Carpet Arrivals (Photos) Effectively operating as the audiences surrogate is Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) a first-rate FBI agent specializing in kidnapping cases who with a SWAT team discovers a ""house of horrors"" in which dozens of rotting corpses wrapped in plastic are hidden behind the walls. The house is owned by the Diaz family a Sonora cartel operating on both sides of the U.S./Mexican border. Kate kills one bad dude herself during the operation which is considered so successful that shes paged to join a secret American task force whose mission is to lop off the Diaz clans head. Working in league with the Mexicans while knowing full well how compromised many of their security forces are the Yank team welcomes its first female member (her black partner played by Daniel Kaluuya isnt selected although he still goes along for part of the ride). But its on-the-ground leader Matt (Josh Brolin) amuses himself by explaining as little as possible to Kate about whats going on as they fly off in a private jet. In a terrifically orchestrated set piece the Americans cross in a huge caravan from El Paso to Ciudad Juarez navigate through dicey neighborhoods in which naked mutilated bodies hang upside-down from an overpass extricate their prey from prison then get stuck in horrendous traffic near the border crossing as menacing tattooed guys with guns materialize from a nearby car. Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins worked brilliantly together on Prisoners while employing a very dark palette of blacks grays and deep greens. Their collaboration here is equally great in a story and setting defined by parched desert tones cheap and impermanent buildings and vast pale blue skies. A preponderance of scenes involves information haves and have-nots or situations where charatcers motives are unclear. The blocking framing and use of lenses accentuate these disparities in ways that expertly heighten the tension and sense of uncertainty. There are also terrific aerial shots that show the border including portions of the American-built fence with great vividness. Read more Cannes Two Hot Hollywood-Themed Docs to Get Sneak Screenings (Exclusive) The character whos most often and intentionally kept in the dark about whats going on is Kate. Far from being a naive greenhorn shes already somewhat embittered (shes divorced with no kids) and has trouble sorting out the chain of command much less whats expected of her. One of the big wheels in the heavily militarized operation is the world-weary Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) a native Colombian said to have formerly been a prosecutor in Mexico who warns her that ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears. By the end you will understand."" Sicario offers Blunts character nothing in the way of military challenges that can quite rival what the actress took on last year in Edge of Tomorrow. Instead she provides a sharply penetrating reading of a smart resilient young woman whose desire to help out is no match for the deceptions and frustrating barriers placed in her way. Seeing how much she has to contribute -- to the missions at hand to the country to a personal relationship -- its sad bordering on tragic to think that she could end up as just another potential victim of an unending war that in one way or another poisons everyone it touches. Blunts performance is first-rate. There is plenty of heavy-duty action here probably enough to sate audiences with genre appetites. But this is not a film in which a few heavily armed gringos can just strut into Mexico and take care of the problem with a few blasts of their big guns. The macho guys and the armaments are here all right but Sicario very clearly makes its point about how deeply the roots of corruption are embedded in the soil of Mexico and the American Southwest. And via Alejandro it underlines how the problem has moved north from Colombia up to Central America Sonora and the American border. Read more Cannes Festival Stumbles Over ""Flatgate"" Controversy In the end Kates desire to build a prosecutable case is trumped by jurisdictional issues realities on the ground and personal vendettas which are abiding. Good and legal intentions are as nothing in this world. ""This is the future Kate"" Matt advises her and even when she briefly seeks a little personal Ramp;R with a macho guy in a bar (Jon Bernthal) things are not what they seem. How can an honest woman win? How can the U.S. retain a semblance of virtue in such a struggle? How can Mexico and countries further south diminish this curse? How can the contamination of drugs and blood money be reversed? Such are the questions the film acutely raises and that no one can properly answer. Unlike Blunts more dimensional Kate the male characters are so prevented from showing their true selves by the professional roles they have taken on that they must remain a bit opaque. But from a behavioral point of view the cast is outstanding. Excellent as the real-life drug lord in the as-yet unreleased Escobar Paradise Lost Del Toro underplays to strong effect here as a mysterious man clearly vying to live as many lives as a cat. Brolin is most engaging as the operations chief who bounces between laid-back somnolence and gung-ho exuberance at the flick of a switch while Victor Garber properly plays the American boss man with intriguing opaqueness. Shot in New Mexico the production has been superbly decked out in every department. But special note must be made of the brilliantly idiosyncratic and disturbing score by Icelandic composer Johann Johannson which cranks up the unease of key scenes with an electronic bass wallow that then descends to seemingly impossible depths of apocalyptic dread.

By Anthony Lane Emily Blunt plays an agent fighting the drug cartels in Denis Villeneuves new film.   Credit Illustration by Diego Patino What does Denis Villeneuve do for fun? Does he know what fun is? Hard to say but its not an aspect of life that looms large for the people in his films. Sitting down to a triple bill of ""Incendies"" (2010) ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Enemy"" (2013) is like putting yourself on a diet of Kafka and late-period Thomas Hardy; Villeneuves characters seem to proceed on the weary assumption that fate is stacked against them. That holds true for his latest movie ""Sicario"" which barely raises its hopes and despite being set along the border between the United States and Mexico shows no inclination to lift its face to the sun. Emily Blunt plays an F.B.I. agent named Kate Macer who runs a kidnap-response squad. In the opening scene she and her colleague Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) lead an assault on a house in Chandler Arizona hunting for hostages but finding only bodies. Stacked upright inside the wall cavities like corpses in an ancient catacomb these are victims of the drug cartels that ply their unmerciful trade across the frontier. All that Kate can do most of the time is clean up the mess; far more satisfying would be a blow struck against its source and her chance arrives when she is assigned to a new and unusual outfit. It bears no official name but Kate finds herself moving in a mist of initials C.I.A. D.E.A. and swat teams at the ready. Her contact is Matt (Josh Brolin) who grins a lot wears flip-flops around the office and can split an infinitive wide open. Asked his objective he replies ""To dramatically overreact."" The plan is to lure a cartel bigwig Manuel Diaz (Bernardo Saracino) out of the shadows by transporting his brother another neer-do-well from a Mexican jail and onto U.S. soil a quiet little affair involving a fleet of black vehicles stiff with special forces. Villeneuves coup is to prepare us for a car chase and then bring the whole thing to a juddering halt. If you ever get glued into a traffic jam in hostile territory this according to ""Sicario"" is what you do. First you play spot-the-hoodlum with the surrounding cars ""Red Impala two lanes left."" ""Seven oclock green Civic."" Then you open fire at anything you dont like the look of--pretty much how most of us would behave at rush hour in gridlock if we werent too busy fiddling with our cup holders. As for the guys who get shot Kate is told ""They wont even make the paper in El Paso."" That may be the most troubling side of ""Sicario"" a growing awareness that the currency of life is being devalued. Hence the convoys tour of Juarez the town where Diazs brother is held and where mutilated figures are hung as warning signs from an overpass. In dumber action films we scarcely flinch as villains are wiped out; the wiping indeed viewed with a boisterous crowd on a Friday night becomes a comic spree. That is not Villeneuves way. The prospect of human cheapening nags at him and the burden of his conscience is carried in this movie by Kate. ""I want to follow some kind of process"" she says only to learn that the rules are not just flouted but leached of meaning in the zone where the drug wars are waged. ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears and you will doubt everything we do"" those are the catechistic words of Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) who is also attached to the anti-cartel troupe. His record his family his current employer and even his country of origin begin as mysteries and gradually emerge as the film slides by. By the end we still cant be sure to whom or to what cause he answers. The code of him remains uncracked. This is ideal for del Toro who always gets scarier when his gestures outnumber his lines and when his lines have you leaning forward to listen. He dramatically underreacts. Late one night faced with busloads of Mexican immigrants held by the U.S. authorities and patiently biding their time Alejandro squats down and softly questions them in Spanish hunting for whispers of information. Even his violence has a strange economy he torments one suspect not by punching him but simply by wetting a finger and worming it deep into the poor fellows ear. Likewise although we dont actually witness what he does to Diazs brother in an interrogation room the ease with which del Toro comes in swinging a full multi-gallon bottle of water taken from the office cooler supplies all the menace we require and it acts as a foil to the more genial toughness of Brolins Matt. The only hitch here is Emily Blunt. The task of her character is to protest and to put questions trying to work out why she was asked to string along and the truth once revealed is no big deal. That isnt enough I think for an actress who seems constitutionally wiser than the folks around her. In her low-lidded gaze and in the permanent rumor of a smile on her lips we catch hints of someone determined to be more amused than bored by the world though never so crass as to be wowed. Nobody writes leading roles for such an actress any more in the way that Ben Hecht (with help from Dorothy Parker Moss Hart and others) wrote ""Nothing Sacred"" for Carole Lombard; thats why the best of Blunt resides in her bit parts in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Charlie Wilsons War"" and in the astonishing scene from ""The Adjustment Bureau"" in the bathroom of the Waldorf-Astoria in which she goes from meeting Matt Damon to smooching him in three minutes and twenty seconds. Who else could do that and get us to believe it? What do you do with a performer who makes a kiss look as easy as a laugh and vice versa? What you dont do is give her a gun erase the bloom from her cheeks and command her at all costs to keep a straight and stony face. Yet that is what Blunt has undergone of late first in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and now in the dauntingly humorless ""Sicario."" She makes a decent action heroine never less than pained and strained but for her its like playing a single octave on the piano. There is one sequence in which Kate drinks dances and lets her hair down but it soon turns predictably sour as though she were being penalized for flirting with the mere possibility of joy--a serious faux pas in a place that Alejandro calls a ""land of wolves."" Orson Welles covered the same land on the same porous border in ""Touch of Evil"" and the stink of corruption that rose from it was as rank as that of ""Sicario""; yet he also found space for bitter comedy and even amorous regret whereas Villeneuve dares not release his characters from their chains. Consider Silvio (Maximiliano Hernandez) a Mexican citizen whose fortunes we follow from the start. He talks to his young son whom he clearly loves and promises to play soccer with him soon but we realize that Silvio has something to contribute to the plot and we fear--as Villeneuve invariably wants us to fear--the worst. Do father and son ever get to play that game together? You guess. If ""Sicario"" does not collapse under its own grimness that is because of the pulse the care with which Villeneuve keeps the story beating like a drum as he steadies himself for the next set piece. I especially liked the nocturnal raid on a tunnel used by the cartels to ferry narcotics and assailed by Matt Alejandro and a bunch of U.S. operatives with Kate and Reggie her friend from the F.B.I. bringing up the rear. Aside from the pops and blasts of weaponry (described by Matt as ""the Fourth of July on steroids"") the scene is so confoundingly dark that in a near-parody of Villeneuves style we observe it through not one but two forms of night vision a thermal blur of monochrome plus a grainy green-and-white. The director of photography is Roger Deakins who both refines and redeems ""Sicario"" by unearthing a kind of difficult beauty in the most unpromising of locations and in the most desperate of straits. The landscape over which Kate flies at the outset of her mission could be an alien planet with its swirling patterns of rock were it not for the tiny shadow of the airplane passing across them like a bug. ""Want to see something cool?"" a member of the team asks before taking her up on a roof under an infuriated sky and pointing out the explosions and crackles of gunfire that signal the fall of night in Juarez. Best of all as the American forces walk toward that fateful tunnel the day is dying behind them and they are silhouetted against its fiery orange and rose. They wear high-tech helmets with cameras mounted on them yet we somehow expect to see cowboy hats and the nodding head of a horse. At such moments ""Sicario"" feels like one of the last Westerns tense forbidding and trapped on the fringes of the nation in a battle that cannot be won.

Photo Courtesy of TIFF In addition to world premieres like Thursday nights opening films ""Demolition and ""Where To Invade Next the huge Toronto International Film Festival slate includes a number of outstanding movies that have premiered at other festivals like Cannes and are looking for awards traction. One of the more noteworthy titles is Canadian director Denis Villeneuves cracking drug thriller ""Sicario which provides a vehicle for the wonderful Emily Blunt to give an Oscar-worthy performance as a tough but idealistic FBI agent who is asked to volunteer as a liaison to a multi-agency effort to take down a powerful Mexican drug lord whos supplying the Southwestern United States leaving a string of dead victims in his wake. Like Jessica Chastains heroine in ""Zero Dark Thirty shes largely kept in the dark about the particulars of the mission which turn out to involve extralegal techniques similar to those employed in the war on terror. The operation is led by a smarmy ""consultant (Josh Brolin) who Blunts character suspects is a CIA agent and includes a shadowy South American operative (Benicio del Toro) whose motives are also suspect to Blunt. I dont want to go into any more detail about ""Sicario which my colleague Kyle Smith will be reviewing when it opens in New York on Sept. 18. Suffice it to say its incredibly suspenseful loaded with well-designed action and full of twisty surprises. Brolin and del Toro are also terrific in the film which is well worth seeing and its a well-deserved showcase for Blunt.

And during its throat-grabbingly effective opening it seems he may have the final word on this oft-visited genre. As an FBI team headed by Emily Blunts stoic agent Kate literally crashes an Arizona drug-cartel hideout a gruesome cache of human corpses is uncovered behind the drywall - and the filmmaking practically gives off its own vivid indignant stench. Cinematographer Roger Deakinss dynamic camera forces us to look where wed rather not; Johann Johannssons score swarms with malevolent foreboding. Even as he borrows from other movies hellish visions - some of the most arresting imagery here feels lifted from Amat Escalantes 2013 Cannes winner Heli - Villeneuve knows how to overwhelm his audience. That panicked pitch however is tough to sustain across two hours of beautifully wrought moral turpitude that nonetheless doesnt contain many stunning revelations. Kate is drafted into a mysterious agency-merging task force established to bait and bring down a key cartel leader though her requests for information are blocked at nearly every turn shes not even sure if her rule-bending team leader (Josh Brolin on strong non-stick form) belongs to the CIA or not. Still hes a positive chatterbox compared to Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro superb) a quietly lethal ex-prosecutor with a personal stake in the hunt. Good guys and bad guys largely wear the same hats in this ethical minefield but thats hardly news as in Villeneuves similarly nasty formidable Prisoners Sicario occasionally seems a little too impressed by its own nihilism. Still this is an involving grown-up film from a director whose muscular technique continues to impress one might call it pulp in the same manner one would a plate of minced meat.

If you like suspenseful movie with good cinematography which evokes interesting questions rather than feeding you everything with cheesy scenes then its right up your street. Without spoiling anything we dont know who the Sicario is (Hitman in spanish) till the last part of the film. Roger Deakins cinematography is amazing as always amp; although all 3 lead actors were great Benicio Del Toro was the best Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 27 2015JosieTastemakerFeaturedI had expected a lot more from this movie and unfortunately I was left feeling slightly underwhelmed.  I was very happy to see a movie promoted a strong female lead at the head of an investigation against the drug cartels.  Instead what I found was Emily Blunt fighting for what was right when you could see that sometimes the wrong way around things is the right way.  The biggest struggle in the movie I felt was Emily Blunt trying and failing to give up smoking. The main story line minus Emily was excellent and I would have loved to have seen it from the other side instead of following a protagonist who in the end had become quite irritating.  A wrong portrayal of a strong female lead from the filmmakers in my eyes.  Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 20 2015KirstyAnne87TastemakerFeaturedI never expected to be drawn so much into this film  It is very intense really snappy and the right amount of drama. The way the story builds up is just incredible. All the characters are like-able and at the same time you loathe the situation they are caught up in you really dont know who to cheer for. I guess that is the point - no side wins casualties just get caught up in the power and politics. Emily Blunt and Del Torro are mesmerizing I really think he deserves an Oscar.Big plot twists along the way that distort your views watch open mouthed and sometimes with my eyes closed.Absolutely fantastic Would certainly see it againHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 18 2015Vieve WTastemakerFeaturedI went to see this at a late night Thursday showing. The film had a slow start if Im honest introducing Emily Blunts character an FBI agent along with her partner. Once it got going however it was action packed and explosive. Sicario (in Colombia meaning people who are hired to kill for money) involved the Colombian Medellin cartel the Mexican drug cartels and a load of CIA and FBI agents. Emily Blunt did a stunning job at portraying a rookie and vulnerable FBI agent. My favourite character was played by Benecia Del Toro...but I wont give it away Although the pace drops at times it still delivers. Gritty and action filled I wasnt disappointedHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 15 2015critique _FeaturedSomewhat over-rated by the critics. One or two excellent set-pieces some impressive photography and a superb pulsating soundtrack but Soderbergh`s Traffic (also starring del Toro) dealt with similar themes in a much more thorough and coherent manner. Three and a half stars.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 11 2015CharlieBanksFeaturedJudging from the posters and trailers for Sicario you may be lead to believe that this film is about FBI agent ""Kate Macer"" (played by Emily Blunt) willing to prove herself under a threatening new assignment. But half way through the film Emily takes a back seat from her ""bad-assery"" as seen in films like the Edge of Tomorrow and portrays a realistic approach to someone who is way out of her depth in a multi-layered crime story centered around the Mexican cartel (lets face it under these circumstances sometimes its best not to be the hero).After being caught up in a drug bust which evolved into a mass body count - She soon meets Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro or ... Puerto Rican Brad Bitt as I like to call him...) and Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) - key operatives in a mission to fight back against Fausto Alarcon - one of the head honchos of the cartel. And at this point in the story you begin to realise that the story is not so much centred around Kate but more so on the character of Alejandro and what his mission is.The most memorable part for me during this film is a sequence that was shot in night vision - almost akin to the kind of experience you have whilst playing an intense video game. The cinematography and action was fantastic drawing me in and keeping me on my toes. But I found the story somewhat lacking...there were some good twists here and there but at times the story was lost on me with some of the military jargon being laid on a bit too thick.Overall - a good action film to watch with an interesting story if you can keep up with it. Im sure fans of Denis Villeneuves previous films will not be disappointedHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 11 2015BenTastemakerFeaturedAlmost despairingly grim and pessimistic Villeneuve ratchets up the tension to 11 (aided by Johann Johannssons terrifying score) with dread or danger almost always apparent - the 2 major set-pieces in particular are stunning.As good as the performances and cinematography are I cant see myself returning to this world but for 2 hours of entertainment in the cinema it delivers the goods. Probably Villeneuves best US film to date.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 11 2015CLARE SFeaturedHard hitting gritty piece. Not the usual action packed thriller but something much darkerHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 10 2015Joe LFeaturedAwesome movie On your toes all the time and a good classic thriller but not a blockbusterHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 9 2015John CtastemakerFeaturedWho is working for who ? What are they up to ?The film is very well made and deliberately avoids spelling it out.The film is fiction but seems to be suggesting that the facts could be close to what is America is really doing to clean up drug cartels happy to use torture to murder and happy to trash any standards of law amp; order. All a bit depressing really.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 9 2015Melitta EFeaturedIf youre after a packaged Hollywood movie thats neat and tied with a bow this isnt it. Its gritty funny heartwarming scary confusing; truer to life than most films. Its unpretentious but holds you from the get go. Benicios acting is superb; difficult to read he commands respect and fear. Emily Blunts character wasnt what I expected although it fits with the films progression.Id recommend going to see it. Avoid the trailers and dont come with any preconceptions of what the film will be and youll be pleasantly surprised - providing you like your thrillers undiluted.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 7 2015Shona RTastemakerFeaturedWhat a weird one  Nice soundtrack some great acting by Benecio DT but the storyline was all over the place. If you want to watch something about drug smuggling - go watch Narcos on Netflix.

Lots of build up almost too much. I think the movie got lost along the way. Started off as one thing and ended up as anothers. The magical traffic jam the cop and his footballing kid? I dunno.. would not watch this again.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 7 2015JulikaFeaturedIts a good thriller The soundtrack and sound editing were the best part in my opinion. Although from the trailer I thought Emily Blunts character would be more interesting a good strong female agent for a change. But instead she is fragile and patronized. For the only female role in the film I expected more. But its a good film nonetheless. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 6 2015Sarah GTastemakerFeaturedJust home after a free Time Out card screening.

I left the cinema feeling like I had lived 3 harrowing days following a covert operation on the war on drugs. Subversive and emotionally complex - the good guys were bad and the bad guys were worse. A philosophy student could do worse than watch this for their lesson on Machiavellianism.A great film Hollywood doesnt make many like thisHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 29 2015Miss AFeaturedSicario is a great action movie in a realistic setting.  A little bit of Hollywood as it is based in LA in some scenes but a gritty and dark tale of the only way to sometimes get justice done.  There some amazing scenes showing the lengths people will go to for money and the true depravity that exists in our society but also some elements which prove just how hard a chosen few will work to fight to keep the world clean and safe.  A great ""True Detective"" type vibe to it.  Definitely recommend.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 28 2015Alex FFeaturedSicario is a very dark thriller that looks into how the U.S. goverment is trying to limit the effect of the Mexican drug cartels.

Two years after making his U.S. debut with the crackerjack kidnapping drama ""Prisoners"" French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve ups his own ante with ""Sicario"" a blisteringly intense drug-trade thriller that combines expert action and suspense with another uneasy inquiry into the emotional consequences of violence. A densely woven web of compelling character studies and larger systemic concerns Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridans bleaker more jaundiced riposte to Steven Soderberghs 2000 ""Traffic"" may prove too grim and grisly for some audiences and too morally ambiguous for others. But with its muscular style and top-flight cast this fall Lionsgate release should score solid (if less than ""Prisoners""-sized) business from discerning adult moviegoers along with dark-horse awards-season buzz. In a terrific performance that recalls the steely ferocity of Jodie Foster in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Jessica Chastain in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" Emily Blunt stars here as Kate Macer an FBI field agent who has been forced to don a Teflon exterior in order to rise through the Bureaus male-dominated ranks and to cope with the depravity she frequently witnesses in the line of duty. ""Sicario"" begins with one such grisly find dozens of rotting human corpses hidden behind the drywall in a suburban Arizona home belonging to an arm of a powerful Mexican drug cartel. But the carnage doesnt end there and when the next round of violence erupts with startling force it sets the apocalyptic tone for everything that follows. Indeed the opening of ""Sicario"" unfolds at such an anxiety-inducing pitch that it seems impossible for Villeneuve to sustain it let along build on it but somehow he manages to do just that. Hes a master of the kind of creeping tension that coils around the audience like a snake suffocating its prey. Together with ""Prisoners"" and Villeneuves previous Oscar-nominated ""Incendies"" ""Sicario"" forms a loose trilogy about the politics of revenge and the value of a human life. But whereas those earlier films were panoramic in scope and choral in structure ""Sicario"" unfolds almost entirely through the eyes of Kate as she wades into the murky waters of an inter-agency task force assembled to give the U.S. a tactical leg up in the war on drugs. Helping to draw her in is Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) a sandal-clad stoner-cadenced mystery man who claims to be a Defense Department contractor though Kate and her partner (Daniel Kaluuya) suspect from the start that he could be CIA. Like more than one character in ""Sicario"" Graver can claim almost as many identities as he can ulterior motives. Graver tells Kate that his operation needs her unique expertise and while she isnt fully convinced shes still young and naive enough to believe that theres a right side in this war and that the U.S. is on it. Riding shotgun with Graver is another shadow man known only as Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) -- the ""sicario"" (a slang term for hitman) of the title -- who is said to be a former Mexican prosecutor and who has the solemn intensity of a man determined to get his way or die trying. ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears and you will doubt everything we do"" he tells Kate matter-of-factly on their first meeting -- words that double as advice to the movies audience. The knotty plot that follows demands close attention but never becomes too difficult (or self-consciously opaque) to follow. It involves multiple trips back and forth across the U.S.-Mexico border as the agents attempt to use one high-ranking cartel boss (Bernardo Saracino) to flush out an even bigger one (Julio Cesar Cedillo) though exactly why is a crucial detail ""Sicario"" holds close to the vest until late in the third act. In the meantime Villeneuve stages one extraordinary suspense setpiece after another starting with an epic traffic jam at the border that ensnares the Americans just as they are heading back home with a piece of very precious cargo in tow. Using no special tricks -- just the sharp color-saturated compositions of cinematographer Roger Deakins; the airtight cutting of editor Joe Walker; and the subtly menacing score of composer Johan Johannsson -- Villeneuve creates a sequence as nail-biting as any ""Fast and the Furious"" car chase except that here all the cars are standing perfectly still. As in the films of Clint Eastwood (whose ""Mystic River"" exuded an obvious influence on ""Prisoners"") and Michael Mann the violence in Villeneuves work is savage and startling but never overstated or sensationalized and every bullet fired ripples with consequences for both the victim and the trigger man (or as the case may be woman). Navigating the crossfire Blunt is mesmerizing to watch her intense blue eyes ablaze with intelligence as she tries to sort out the facts of the case from its attendant fictions and whether Graver and Alejandros endgame justifies its ethically dubious means. Every bit as impressive is Del Toro who has worked both sides of the street where cartel dramas are concerned (""Traffic"" ""Savages"") but whose Alejandro is cut from considerably more complicated cloth. He is a swift unforgiving man with a wolfish jowl and the preternatural calm of the predator lying in wait. Yet he also shudders in his sleep reveals flashes of battered humanity when one least expects it and even fleetingly a Hannibal Lecter-ish lust for the flinty young woman thrust into his path. And as the film hurtles towards its climactic abyss it is Del Toro who holds us rapt with a nearly silent performance that is the very embodiment of character through action. Working with a mix of technical collaborators old and new Villeneuve has once again delivered an impeccably well-crafted film not least in Deakins arresting widescreen lensing which alternates between vast aerial canvases that capture the epic sprawl of the border land and closeups so carefully framed and lit as to show particles of dust dancing on a shaft on sunlight.

Michel says January 8 2016 at 922 am The comparison to ""Traffic"" is ironic recalling the scene where Michael Douglass character passes his failures (his personal amp; career) reins over to his successor. ""Sicairo"" shows as is the case in real life only the level of violence has increased and sadly our (conditioned) acceptance of it. Viewing ""Sicairo"" is akin to trying really hard not to be your typical ""rubber necker"" at a horrific accident scene one just cant avoid looking. Reply Sal says December 3 2015 at 432 pm This is one awesome movie and pulls no punches. Del Toro is spectacular. l have seen it 5 times and counting. Reply clay says October 16 2015 at 739 am Awsone Writeup...didnt giveaway anything yet decriptive of the movie...dinallt thank you  ^_^- Reply clay says October 16 2015 at 742 am Oh darn please edit lol Reply Adam says October 6 2015 at 1032 am I enjoyed the film. It was intense and interesting and the performances were stellar all around. My only criticism is regarding the Emily Blunts character (Again this is not about her performance which I thought was great.) (spoilers below) In the film it seemed like everything happens ""to"" her. Other than volunteering for the multi-unit task force (about which she knew next to nothing and merely agreed to out of a desire to avenge her fallen comrades from the opening scenes) she was more like a tag-along character. I like my film heroes to be active and lead. Once on the task force Blunts character though clearly a capable tactical FBI agent was confused or lost or unwilling to fully participate. Numerous times she was caught in a bad situation man-handled by the male characters and/or had to be rescued or saved. Even in the end she was forced at gunpoint to go against her beliefs and desires. I would like to make one thing clear. My criticism is not about her character being female. On the contrary by making the character female then not allowing her to thrive or eventually thrive the filmmakers missed an opportunity. As it is the character seems more like a device through which to watch Benicio Del Toros character act. Reply michael says January 8 2016 at 1124 am You misspoke the Emily Blunt character is not the hero of the movie she is the narrator with whom we can relate. She is intentionally flawed and represents ""us/viewers/Americans"" and provides a lens through which we can watch the actions unfold. She has our weaknesses. She is scared vulnerable even foolish at times with her naivety. She has moral standards and looks at the small picture rather than the greater good. She was never intended to save the day rather she is there to juxtapose the gruesomeness around her.
