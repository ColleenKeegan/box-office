When I sit staring at my computer screen instead of writing a review its usually because the movie is bad and Id rather not deal with it. But in the case of ""Blades of Glory"" with Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as champion figure skaters its because I keep switching to the Web site to savor the clips and trailer. Once youve seen the movie which is blissfully silly triumphantly tasteless and improbably hilarious its nice to reconnect with a few choice moments. ENLARGE Everything flows from the sly audacity of the premise -- rival champions who join forces to become the first male/male pair in figure-skating history. Mr. Ferrells Chazz Michael Michaels is as frowzily macho as Mr. Heders Jimmy MacElroy is ethereally fey. And though the plot twists that unite them are ingenious the genius of the production directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon lies in its performers who play their ludicrous roles with fervent seriousness. (Theres no way of knowing who did what with the script which is credited to five writers Craig Cox Jeff Cox Busy Philipps John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky.) Will Ferrell wins the W.C. Fields prize for dissoluteness whether Chazz is off skates moving like a tree stump -- and dominating a therapy group for sex addicts -- or on the ice where he raises crotch jokes to new heights and thanks to the wonders of computer-generated effects does spectacular leaps and glides with his mismatched partner. Remarkably Mr. Ferrell has scored two consecutive comic coups -- Chazz is right up there with Ricky Bobby in ""Talladega Nights."" But something of the same goes for Jon Heder. Who could have guessed that the winsome nerd of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" would morph into the bespangled ice queen of ""Blades of Glory""? To borrow one of Chazzs malapropisms the whole thing is mind-bottling. And belly-bobbling. After the Wedding What makes a movie big or small? By any conventional measure ""After the Wedding"" is a small import (from Denmark) shot on a modest budget with a small cast in an intimate style. Yet this drama which won a richly deserved Oscar nomination earlier this year spans two continents to tell a story of huge impact and all but bursts with outsize passions. ENLARGE Sidse Babett Knudsen and Mads Mikkelsen in After the Wedding The story starts in Bombay where Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) the Danish director of an impoverished orphanage learns of a providential donation from an industrialist in Denmark. The only catch is that Jacob must fly home to meet the benefactor Jorgen face to face. (Jorgen is played brilliantly by Rolf Lassgard.) Once the two men have met the host invites his guest to his daughters wedding and Jacobs past suddenly becomes his shocking present. If that sounds like a dramatic cliche rest assured that nothing in this film feels familiar or predictable. Nor does the drama need to draw us in. Its the special magic of the director Susanne Bier who wrote the script with Anders Thomas Jensen that were in the midst of things from the very beginning and like the films characters taking our cues from fleeting glances and odd gestures or facing great explosions of rage grief and love. (Jorgens wife is played by Sidse Babett Knudsen who manages to make self-containment seem explosive.) With her two previous pictures ""Open Hearts"" and ""Brothers"" Ms. Bier established herself as an exceptional international filmmaker. Her new one is a thrilling -- and harrowing and beautiful -- celebration of the unpredictability of life. And unexpectedly it gives us the chance to see Mads Mikkelsen who recently played Le Chiffre the heavy in ""Casino Royale"" turn his dark-star power into a dramatic presence. Le Chiffre merely wept blood. Jacob is flesh and blood in a film of rare humanity. The Lookout ENLARGE Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a mixed-up man in The Lookout Scott Frank did the screen adaptation for one of my favorite movies of the past decade ""Out Of Sight"" so I kept a lookout for ""The Lookout"" his directorial debut with some apprehension as well as anticipation. When someone you admire takes a shot at something new theres always a chance of failure. Not to worry though. Mr. Franks fine script -- an original this time -- got the strong director it deserved. This first feature plays like the work of a practiced hand full of energy and memorable menace. Memory or the lack of it is at the storys center. A head injury has left the young hero Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) impaired in maddening ways. Like Leonard in ""Memento"" Chris who works as a night janitor at a bank has such fleeting short-term memory that he can manage his life only by making entries on an endless to-do list. But the resemblances to Christopher Nolans virtuoso puzzle picture are outweighed by the differences for ""The Lookout"" is a straight-ahead drama perfectly accessible though psychologically intricate coupled shrewdly to a crime thriller. In a small Kansas town where everyone knows him Chris is seduced by Gary Spargo a local thug into serving as a lookout for a ruthless crew of bank robbers. Gary is played by Matthew Goode; hes a marvelously scary study in sociopathy. Jeff Daniels is less flashy but no less forceful as Chriss mentor Lewis a blind man who speaks wisely if too loudly. And Joseph Gordon-Levitts Chris isnt flashy at all. To the contrary this painfully vulnerable often befuddled young man seems to be thinking his way through every moment of every hour as he struggles to sort out right and wrong and solve the mysteries of his fragile identity. We saw what Mr. Gordon-Levitt could do in such diverse films as ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Brick"" and in the TV sitcom ""3rd Rock From the Sun."" But this performance is something else. Its unforgettable. Meet the Robinsons Meet the Robinsons"" is preceded by its reputation -- an animated feature from Disney that was reshaped and recut under the supervision of John Lasseter a legendary founder of Pixar Animation Studios after the Walt Disney Company acquired Pixar last year. And whats the result? A 3-D fantasy thats lovely to look at but less than delightful to know. Its insistently relentlessly busy -- Inspector Gadget as an orphaned boy genius named Lewis who builds a time machine and finds the family of his dreams in a Necco-colored future that looks suspiciously like a theme park. Thats harsh Im sure. Kids will know nothing of the films reputation and their little eyes will pop behind their big Polaroid glasses. Some of the spectacle is charming. The villain an Edwardian figure called the Bowler Guy goes through all sorts of amusing contortions. And little Lewis comes happily to terms with his life in a semi-touching climax. But oh the semi-coherence -- at best -- of his family encounter and the desperate clutter of the disjointed narrative. When an orchestra of frogs did a brief rendition of ""Give Me the Simple Life"" they were playing my song. The Prisoner The Prisoner Or How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair"" is the very long title of a very short and troubling documentary by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. Theyre the director and producer respectively who made the 2005 ""Gunner Palace"" a free-form doc with a hip hop soul about American soldiers in wartime Baghdad. During the course of that film Mr. Tucker shot a scene in which our troops stormed a house that was thought to be a sanctuary for bomb makers planning to kill the British prime minister. The new film is essentially an extended interview with Yuris one of the men arrested in the raid. Whats troubling about the films technique is its lack of context; we must take Yuris who speaks serviceable English pretty much at his word. Whats troubling about his story is its ring of truth. Yuris seems to have been an innocent -- a freelance cameraman with no political agenda -- caught up in a blundering search based on bad intelligence and connected to Tony Blair only by the surreal assumptions of his captors. After spending nine months in Abu Ghraib Prison or so he claims he was sent home by an American general who simply said ""Were sorry."" Yuris makes an eloquent case for himself. ""I am not a terrorist"" he says. ""I am not a monster. I am civilian people and I am journalist. I have a heart you see. I am not Dracula.""    DVD TIP Will Ferrell was Mugatu a sinister fashion designer in ""Zoolander"" (2001). The fatuous fashion icon of the title was played by the films director Ben Stiller. By no coincidence Mr. Stiller and his producing partner Stuart Cornfeld were producers of ""Blades of Glory.""

March 30 2007  (out of 4)Starring Will Ferrell Jon Heder Craig T. Nelson William Fichtner Will Arnett and Amy Poehler. Written by Jeff Cox and Craig Cox. Directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon. 93 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowThe lamest studio comedy since Wild Hogs also bears some dispiriting traces of that archly awful middle-aged motorcycle movie including a colossally lazy lead performance (in this case Will Ferrell as a sex-addicted flab-flashing macho figure skater) massive dollops of fratboy homosexual anxiety a visual style that recalls outtakes of King of Kensington and beaucoup gags about men in jewel-hugging trousers. Theres one other crossover it will probably make a stretchy sparkly spandex pantload of money.Ferrell wearing a Def Leppard do Elvis Stojkos cast-off tough-guy costumes and that blank idiot look hes worn for about 16 movies released in the past 18 months plays Chazz Michael Michaels a skater with an ego almost as large as his overdetermined delusion that the sport is a hyper-masculine domain. Seeing Nancy Kerrigan at a competition Michaels blurts ""You an official here? Because youve officially given me a boner""Har-har. Jon Heder the actor with teeth like Trigger and a look almost as blank as Ferrells plays Jimmy MacElroy a vastly more femme ice jockey who minces across the ice wearing a peacock blue outfit replete with a huge tail poking from the back. Perhaps in a gesture to poetic symmetry he also has punchline hair.So double-har again. When these two hyper-competitive examples of misplaced sexuality find themselves sharing a gold medal the podium brawl that breaks out results in both being suspended from solo competition. Disgraced and shunned by their peers the two oblivious rivals eventually find themselves joined at the jock as the first two-man competitive pair. A predictable deluge of gay-blade mirth ensues.Written by five people and directed by two and bravely taking on a subject that may rank only with talking chimpanzees as an easy comedic target Blades of Glory is only slightly less funny - if you ask ignorant old me - than watching real figure skating.

Related Video with Will FerrellWill Ferrell Brilliant Idiot Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Will Ferrell appears topless onscreen more frequently than any current movie actress. So to think of him for more than a second obliges one to contemplate with a kind of cringing pleasure his torso. The chest is large white and flabby suggesting a beached sea otter and its pocked with what looks like dozens of tiny imperfectly attached hair-implant tufts. It might be a helicopters eye view of merino sheep stranded on a tundra. For Ferrell to expose this slab of flank might be deemed inappropriate at best sadistic at worst. But because he does it without the requisite shame its funny since the actor is usually playing guys who are cocooned in and sustained by an utterly unwarranted belief in themselves. Ferrell knows as surely as his characters dont that his body is nothing to boast about. So to display it as if it were worthy of a Muscle amp; Fitness cover is to tell us that they are as unself-conscious as they are self-unaware. Ferrell might be the fellow who ran naked across the stage at the 1974 Oscar ceremony inspiring this ad lib by David Niven ""Isnt it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings."" For the Oscar streaker a moment of notoriety and humiliation. For Ferrell the route to movie stardom. Ferrell bares his chest in his new movie -- to show his hated rival ""what a real skaters body looks like."" Thats just one similarity Blades of Glory (a great title by the way) has with other Ferrell films. Its a sports comedy like Kicking and Screaming (soccer) Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (NASCAR racing) and next years Semi-Pro (basketball). Like Talladega it gives him a colleague whos also a rival (Jon Heder) and a villain (here the tandem of Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) who will surely be defeated in the climactic competition. Blades also plants a few sport icons in the supporting cast; as Dale Earnhart Jr. dressed up the race-car movie Peggy Fleming Dorothy Hamill Scott Hamilton Brian Boitano and Nancy Kerrigan lent their implicit blessing to the skateathon. Sacha Baron Cohen was in Talladega; Sasha Cohen shows up here. The other thing Blades has in common with Ferrells other comedies is... its OK. Nobody in charge here -- not directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck (their first feature after doing the gecko Geico ads) not the quintet of credited writers (Jeff and Craig Cox Busy Philipps John Altschuler and David Krinsky) certainly not Ferrell -- is even remotely trying to make a great film. It has the slapdash air of a movie that was a little more fun to shoot than to watch. To say that Blades is a little sharper than Kicking and Screaming but not nearly so smart as the best parts of Talladega is like taste-testing a Big Mac against a Whopper and a Wendys Classic Double. In other words Blades an acceptable Friday evening diversion most of which will have run through your system by Saturday morning. The pitch for this movie mustve sold Ferrell on the project in about 10 seconds. Indeed its hard not to smile when you hear it. Get ready two top figure skaters -- blond winsome Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) and bad-boy Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) -- get into a brawl on the winners stand and are forever banished from the male singles category. Three and a half years later Chazz is drunk and disgraced impersonating a wizard in some Podunk lounge act on ice and Jimmy is peddling sports equipment at a Ski n Shred. But they love skating more than they hate each other so they agree to become the worlds first male-pairs team. ""As if skating wasnt gay enough already"" a rival snorts. In the commercials playing last night on every TV network in North America all the clips were of Ferrell. And why not? Hes the star again in the role of the overbearing underdog the big galoot whos somehow likable. But its Heder the geek from Napoleon Dynamite whos the more appealing presence and his character who has the cleverer backstory. We learn that as a child Jimmy was adopted by a rich man (William Fichter) bent on breeding champion skaters. ""When I was nine"" Jimmy says ""my dad insisted I be circumcised to minimize wind resistance."" In his early maturity he has soft curls and a winsome grace; Chazz sneers that he looks ""like a 15-year-old girl but not hot."") When Jimmy is stripped of his gold medal his father immediately ""unadopts"" him and dumps the kid at the side of a highway. Even his No. 1 fan against whom Jimmy has a restraining order complains that ""Its embarrassing stalking a has-been."" Jimmy might be a kind of blond Boitano while Chazz is from the butch Elvis Stojko school. But the enmity is surely a gender-bending version of the 1994 feud between Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. In the movie skatings criminal underside is personified by Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg a borderline-incestuous brother-sister pair whose long-skate routine has the theme ""Forbidden Love"" with Stranz skating as JFK and Fairchild as Marilyn Monroe. Arnett and Poehlers turn doesnt quite match Baron Cohens as the French driver in Talladega but Arnett gets points for smarming so nicely-nastily. Viewers will pick their own favorite bits and long soft spots. I liked the star skaters ferociously competitive idiocy. Demonstrating his skin-scalding machismo Chazz skates on bare feet then Jimmy does the human luge on his bare chest. The on-ice routines (overseen by Sarah Kawahara who choreographed some of Michelle Kwans medal-winning performances) are both plausible and funny. Craig T. Nelson as the boys coach is neither -- why is he in a comedy? In this movie the inspired bits and the misfired ones are so close to each other you wonder if anybody involved with it knew the difference or cared. Thats too harsh. Whats important in this sort of comedy is not to hit the bulls-eye with every gag but to establish a genial connection between the star and his audience. Thats Ferrells main achievement during this hot run of his. Since his first smash the 2003 Elf (still his highest grosser) he has kept busy and lucky building a succession of hits dabbling in the higher-IQ type of comedy (Stranger Than Fiction) cameoing in his friends films occasionally lending his luster to indies nobody sees. One of these Winter Passing grossed all of 101228. But thats just pro bono work; these small flops dont taint him. The films Ferrell has starred in have grossed 876885086 at the North American box office. Itd be a stretch but Blades of Glory could bring him up to the 1 billion mark. At the end of Talladega Nights Ferrell and Baron Cohen exchange a long firm kiss after which Baron Cohen says in his faux-French accent ""You taste of America."" Thats Ferrells appeal. Hes us and U.S. a bully and a sweetie deranged and good-natured a jerk and a hero. Hes the American taste burgers and fries supersized.

Nelson. Directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon from a screenplay by Jeff Cox Craig Cox John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky. 93 minutes. Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor language a comic violent image and some drug references. Several theaters. Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder of ""Napoleon Dynamite"") skims across the ice at the World Winter Sports Games his blond hair executing a picture-perfect ripple. Wearing a teal-blue unitard lavishly trimmed with peacock feathers he delicately wafts a hand through the air; its costumed as a peacock head. The commentators enthuse as he comes to the end of his routine in which he releases a live white bird into the arena. Extra points from the judges That bird notes one awed announcer was concealed in his costume the whole time -- adding to the technical difficulty of the program. This is the figure-skating comedy ""Blades of Glory"" -- and part of why its so funny is because its not that far removed from the real figure-skating scene. (Didnt Johnny Weir do some bird-costume thing with his hand not so long ago? No no not a real bird. Yet.) The sport as even its fans know can be a pretty goofy world dripping in sequins weird thematic programs scary makeup knee-whacking drama and all that strange flesh-colored mesh skaters wear to pretend to be more naked than they are. ""Blades of Glory"" takes all this and runs with it and the result is a silly spoof thats often unexpectedly sweet. Will Ferrell in his usual man-child mode plays Chazz Michael Michaels a randy skating star whos Jimmys polar opposite. Denouncing Jimmys moves as ""Cirque du So-Lame"" he skates as if caught in a testosterone hurricane and cheerfully accepts the bras tossed to him by adoring female fans. (Parent alert Chazz is a sex addict though its more discussed than shown.) After Chazz and Jimmy get into a fight at the medal podium they are disciplined by the skating federation and kicked out of the mens division in disgrace. Years pass the World Winter Sports Games again approach and an idea dawns -- why not compete again but in the pairs division? There the two are faced with formidable competition Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) a sinister brother-and-sister pair team who seem well rather more than kin. All of this unfolds in the loose messy throw-it-at-the-wall way that Ferrells comedies usually do (the more ambitious ""Stranger Than Fiction"" being an exception) but plenty of the humor sticks just fine. Arnett whose Stranz is fond of posing alluringly on bearskin rugs (when hes just hanging around the house with his sisters) has an insane glee and Heders deadpan style merges nicely with Ferrells wildness. Many of the skating moves aided by an array of doubles and some clever special effects deserve a 6.0 Ferrell and Heders trademark crotch-crash (sorry I cant describe it any other way); Arnett and Poehlers JFK-and-Marilyn themed program complete with pill-popping; the dangerous Iron Lotus a showy move with consequences rather worse than losing a sequin or two. And as if anyone needed proof that figure skating does have a sense of humor plenty of the sports biggest names turn up in supporting roles (Scott Hamilton as a cheerfully yelling skating commentator) and cameos (Brian Boitano Peggy Fleming Nancy Kerrigan). Former U.S. champion Sasha Cohen however wins the good-sport award for her cameo in which she catches -- and rapturously embraces -- Chazzs sweaty jockstrap. A welcome change from roses maybe?

"A couple of lutzes - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeA couple of lutzesWILL FERRELLS BRAND OF LOW-BROW COMEDY DOESNT QUITE CUT IT IN `BLADES OF GLORYBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 03/29/2007 015757 PM PDTUpdated 03/29/2007 033649 PM PDTClick photo to enlargeWill Ferrell as Chazz Michael Michaels and Jon Heder as Jimmy MacElroy in ""Blades of Glory.""<<1>> ""Blades Of Glory"" is a lot like the competitive ice skating routines that it sets out to mock Lots of excitement at the start. Boring boring. Nice. Boring. Uh ohhhhhh What was he thinking? Ohhhhhh triple axel And he sticks the landing Boring. Boring. Big finish. There are several hilarious scenes and many more funny ideas that never quite get off the ice in the new Will Ferrell comedy. ""Blades of Glory"" is squarely in the mold of his earlier character-driven goofs ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and last summers ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."" But with more plot. That high-concept plot - the work of four writers and the directing team of Will Speck and Josh Gordon - is what intermittently dulls ""Blades"" a movie that often seems to be trying for groans instead of laughs. Some of that is just Ferrells untidy brand of humor which takes as much delight in his body hair and love handles as carefully worked-out comic ideas. Theres no doubt that if youre going to make a comedy about the first all-male (if not entirely all-masculine) pairs figure skating team you want Ferrell on ice. And it might have been interesting to see him play Chazz Michael Michaels as a variation on that insanely optimistic male cheerleader he frequently played on ""Saturday Night Live.Advertisement "" After all mens figure skating has occasionally raised questions about the gender identity of its stars and thats a running joke in ""Blades of Glory"" a comedy with no obvious straight man. But Chazz follows in the swaggering footsteps of his hyper-macho predecessors Ron Burgundy and Ricky Bobby. Just as action movies always begin with their best action sequence these character-driven comedies usually start by establishing whats funny about the main character. ""Blades of Glory"" actually has to set up two of these characters Chazz and Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder the star of ""Napoleon Dynamite""). Their back stories are laid out in the first 10 minutes which starts the movie off at a pace its unable to maintain. Mega-rich makeover artist Darren MacElroy (William Fichtner) spots a little blond boy cranking out triple lutzes on an orphanage skating rink and turning to a nearby nun barks ""Ill take him."" We meet Chazz as an adult with rock star hair and an attitude to match. Hes skatings outlaw hero or as one of the TV commentators puts it ""He is sex on ice."" If his opening dry-hump-athon in front of an arena full of spectators is any indication its dry ice. Making love to the crowd Chazz sticks his tongue out like Gene Simmons of Kiss sticks his crotch out like Mick Jagger and sticks his neck out for no one. The TV announcers who are used extensively to fill in plot points and provide character detail note that Chazz has captivated the arena ""like a stack of classic Europorn."" Chazz and Jimmy are such bitter rivals that when a tie puts them side-by-side on the victory stand they start a brawl that gets them both suspended for life. The scenes before during and after a hearing is convened - with former skating stars Nancy Kerrigan Brian Boitano Dorothy Hamill and Peggy Fleming acting (although just barely) as judges - groan under the weight of plot contrivance. The story then jumps ahead 3 1/2 years - a concession to the four-year Olympic cycle - to find Chazz drinking himself into oblivion while skating in a childrens ice show and Jimmy reduced to selling skates. Chazz frequently gets so loaded that he throws up on the ice and Jimmy takes career advice from his former stalker. This is where the writers strain to turn their big idea from a sketch into a full-length motion picture. They dont quite nail it. Among the movies most promising ideas is a rival pairs team made up of evil brother and sister Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg with Will Arnett of ""Arrested Development"" as Stranz and Amy Poehler of ""Saturday Night Live"" as Fairchild. But the idea and their roles are so tragically underwritten that Arnett and Poehler are mostly left to make funny faces when Chazz and Jimmy qualify for the Nationals then the Olympics. Stranz and Fairchild also have a sister Katie (Jenna Fischer) who is tragically tragic and not particularly funny. Scorned as the familys one untalented skater she is left to do the dirty work for her siblings. This leads her into a spandex-clad embrace with Jimmy a romantic subplot that is not exactly hilarity on ice. The skating sequences are by far the funniest thing in the movie and the source of much prestidigitational (or possibly just digital) wonder. Heder and Ferrell appear to be skating Olympic rings around the competition repeatedly lifting each other - and the movie - as high as they can go ... by the crotch. `BLADES OF GLORY Rated PG-13 (crude and sexual humor profanity comic violent images drug references) Cast Will Ferrell Jon Heder Will Arnett Amy Poehler Craig T.

Starring Will Ferrell Jon Heder Will Arnett Amy Poehler Jenna Fischer and Craig T. Nelson. Directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon. (PG-13. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Decades before Neil Simons inspired christening the odd couple already was a staple of American comedy. Something about the pairing of mismatched souls cracks up audiences. A duo must possess different emotional temperaments and the funniest -- epitomized by Laurel and Hardy -- are physical opposites as well. In ""Blades of Glory"" Will Ferrell and Jon Heder meet all the time-honored parameters including another must maleness. A dissertation could be written on the mind-set that has failed to produce a female Martin and Lewis or Oscar and Felix. Without ingenious casting of the lead characters competitive figure skaters this latest comedy pitched to adolescent minds (or the adolescent at heart) would have been skating on thin ice. It lacks the zany originality of Ferrells ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" and the deadpan humor of Heders sleeper hit ""Napoleon Dynamite."" But one look at the chunky macho Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) in a sparkling red and gold costume standing beside the effeminate and very blond Jimmy MacElroy (Heder) sheathed in powder blue and youre under the thrall of a new peculiar couple. Both actors appear to be having fun outmaneuvering each other on the ice and onscreen. Ferrell puffs up his chest every time Chazz is referred to as sex on ice. Heder is as pixie-ish and light on his feet as Tinkerbell. Fierce rivals Chazz and Jimmy are banned from the sport for life after engaging in a scuffle on the podium where they are to be awarded a shared gold medal. (Their fate is decided by Brian Boitano Dorothy Hamill Peggy Fleming and Nancy Kerrigan although alas no Tonya Harding.) Flash forward several years and a determined coach (Craig T. Nelson reprising a familiar role from TV) rescues Chazz from a kiddie ice review and Jimmy from peddling gym shoes by merging them into the first male figure-skating pair. Whats a loophole allowing men to compete together in this category in a script with so many holes it could be composed on Swiss cheese? Yet its the movies very cheesiness that keeps you watching sometimes unable to believe your eyes. For example a skater practicing a move so dangerous that its being tried out in North Korea is accidentally beheaded by the blade of her partners skate. Theres a drollness almost worthy of Christopher Guest in the way ""Blades of Glory"" parodies classic pairs ice skating routines performed to overwrought musical accompaniment and the pompous commentators who prattle on about them. The ridiculous peacock and leopard-skin costumes are close enough to what competitors actually wear to be aghast anew at such bad taste. Directors Will Speck and Josh Gordon are novices at feature films and their inexperience shows in the flatness of some scenes and sluggish pacing. But the many years they spent making commercials pay off in the movies high point glowing mini-biopics of contenders re-created with all the studied phoniness of the genre. In one a brother-and-sister team (real life husband and wife Will Arnett and Amy Poehler camping it up) are shown bouncing back from their parents deaths by car crash returning to the rink within hours of the funeral. The siblings are Chazz and Jimmys main competitors. Arnett and especially Poehler grimace too often to signal the skaters evil intentions to do anything to win. They send their virginal sister (""The Offices"" Jenna Fischer) to seduce first Jimmy and then Chazz knowing that the latter is in treatment for sex addiction and will be unlikely to resist even if it means alienating his new buddy and spoiling their chances on the ice. In a further parody of serious movies about sports it all comes down to that final competition. Its worth the admission price just to watch Ferrell and Heder both more than 6 feet tall take turns lifting each other and to see Heders ankles wrapped around his co-stars neck. They make an odd pair the best friends a comedy can have. -- Advisory Mild sexual references.

"Blades of Glory | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blades-of-glory ) Blades of Glory (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Will Ferrell can be the most maddening of comedians. There are times when hes so funny it hurts to watch him. Then there are times when hes so unfunny its painful in a different way. Consistency thy name isnt Ferrell. Blades of Glory is pretty much Talladega Nights on skates. It does for figure skating what the earlier film did for NASCAR - right down to the product placements. There are funny bits strewn about but the movie as a whole is a bit of a yawn. Blades of Glory is a feeble satire that doesnt do much thats incisive or interesting and the tame PG-13 rating keeps the raunchiness in check. Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) are polar opposites on and off the ice. Chazz is a freewheeling rolling stone. He doesnt have a coach and his defining characteristic is that hes a sex addict (as he tells just about everyone). Jimmy is graceful and technically adept but his routines lack passion. When these two bitter rivals tie for a gold medal they end up involved in a brawl that results in them being banned for life from the mens competition. Thats when Coach (Craig T. Nelson in familiar territory) gets a brilliant offbeat idea put them together and enter them as pairs skaters. The fact that theyre both men will allow them to pull off moves never before attempted. The reigning king and queen of the ice Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) dont like this threat to their supremacy and take measures to short-circuit it. Maybe the problem with Blades of Glory is that it features too many Saturday Night Live stars. For the most part theyre not funny on T.V. and they dont have more success here. All the mugging for the camera bad timing and intentionally exaggerated hand and body gestures dont do much for me nor do the pratfalls and gross-out gags (like Jimmy lapping up toilet paper off a public lavatory floor - and one senses this scene was significantly reduced in a display of semi-good taste). Or maybe the problem is that theres enough material here for an amusing sketch but not for a full length movie. Its a telling point that co-directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck are making their feature debut after having partnered on two previous comedy shorts. One would expect the subject matter to guarantee a slam-dunk because so many aspects of competitive skating are ripe for satire. (Wheres Dick Button??) But Ferrells daggers have duller edges than his skates and his approach is as flabby as the belly he displays with great pride. On some level he wants us to like the characters so he never takes things too far. That makes for a comedy with no bite. Its a snoozefest that looks pallid in comparison with some of the more courageous and outrageous comedies to have graced the screen recently. (Im thinking of Borat in particular which showed no fear.) Commenting on the technical aptitude of a low-budget comedy is probably as irrelevant as mentioning its dramatic integrity but the effects work and editing in Blades of Glory is especially poor particularly during the skating sequences. Maybe part of the joke is supposed to be that every performance in the movie is godawful and obviously fake but the fact that its possible to see where computer animation comes into play diminishes the movies ability to make us laugh. This is rectified somewhat in Chazz and Jimmys final skate which displays some creativity and humor but thats a small fraction of the time spent on the ice. The gay jokes are kept to a surprising minimum although that subtext cant be ignored. Ferrell represents masculinity at its most crude while John Heder who appears doomed never to live down the iconic role of Napoleon Dynamite gets the effeminate mannerisms and the female characteristics. Its ironic that a straightforward skating movie like The Cutting Edge had more success playing with gay stereotypes than the comedic Blades of Glory. And that leads us to the movies central flaw its not funny enough to be worth the price of admission. With these kinds of marks Blades of Glory isnt going to win many championships.

By John Hartl Film critic msnbc.com updated 4/6/2007 72620 PM ET 2007-04-06T232620 Print Font + - REVIEW The sheer dreamy silliness of Will Ferrells new comedy ""Blades of Glory"" carries it for a remarkably long time. Even after the movie starts recycling ideas and turns formulaic with an overextended chase sequence its impossible to dislike. The freshness of the story line about a pair of ice-skating divas who are forced to work together must be attributed to a couple of brothers Jeff Cox and Craig Cox who had never written a screenplay. Theyve given Ferrell a chance to stretch as never before and Jon Heder (from ""Napoleon Dynamite"") turns out to be an ideal partner. Heder plays an insufferable child prodigy Jimmy MacElroy whose professional skating days are numbered once he indulges in a nasty public confrontation with the macho king of the arena Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell). Their fans are horrified by their juvenile brawl on the ice Jimmy and Chazz are stripped of their medals and theyre forbidden ever to skate again professionally. Three and a half years later Jimmys most rabid fan an obsessed stalker with a talent for finding legal loopholes comes up with a plan to get around the ban. Jimmy and Chazz were single skater artists but theres no rule against them returning as a pair the first male/male pair in figure-skating history.

Every on-screen drink in Mad Men in 5 minutes See the Dancing stars most memorable moves Emmys biggest snubs? Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom The only problem they hate each other. Indeed they first attract publicity by beating up on each other in public once more. The rest of the movie deals with their professional and personal progression toward becoming partners while a couple of mean-spirited rivals (Amy Poehler Will Arnett) try to destroy their new career. In addition to the Coxes three other writers are given script credit including John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky who worked on Foxs ""King of the Hill"" series and Busy Philipps a story writer on another memorable show ""Freaks and Geeks."" But its clear that the producers among them Ben Stiller were first impressed by what the Coxes had created. ""Its just such a funny idea"" Stiller claims in the press kit ""so we decided to try to get it made."" Slideshow Will Ferrell It cant have been easy. Stunt doubles and special effects certainly helped but Ferrell and Heder did have to learn to skate reasonably well for several key scenes and so did Arnett and Poehler. A large part of the fun of the movie is watching such familiar actors daring to take on such daunting physical challenges. The films co-directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck were nominated for an Oscar for their live-action 1998 short ""Culture"" and theyve continued as partners with a series of music videos and commercials including Geicos caveman routine. This is their first feature and its a most promising debut. At its best ""Blades of Glory"" recalls Christopher Guests series of knowing showbiz mockumentaries especially ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind."" The filmmakers may lack Guests interest in supporting actors (William Fichtner is wasted and Poehler lacks her ""Saturday Night Live"" verve) but theres no reason to sniff at what they do accomplish.

Plus Another reason why Richard Gere shouldnt be so underrated. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis (Photo Melinda Sue Gordon/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) Of all the Saturday Night Live alumni to hit movie pay dirt Will Ferrell is the only one who never acts as if hes bigger than his material. In one sense thats fitting. His body is only moderately expressive (he uses his flab to droll effect) and his face is mild to the point of blobbiness. Yet Id rather see a new Ferrell movie than one by any of his fellow SNL graduates. He has a sweet spirit missing from other contemporary screen clowns; he finds the poetry in fatuousness. In Anchorman Talladega Nights and the new Blades of Glory Ferrell lovingly ravages the American male psyche. It might be argued that the targets of these moviesTV blowhards and celebrity athletesare easy pickings and that the films are simply full-length parodies of junk genres. But those parodies are an artful mix of tight craftsmanship and gags that spin out like adolescent free associations. Machismo goes hand in dainty hand with homosexual panic while real men are those who overcome their fear of looking like sissies. In Blades of Glory Ferrell plays figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels a sex-obsessed galoot who fondles his female fans and ends his twirls by clutching his crotch and trash-talking his opponents. This is in stark contrast to his rival Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) the girlish blond orphan who closes his balletic routines by gently releasing a white dove. After the pair breaks into fisticuffs (the child-fans weep a teddy-bear mascot goes up in flames) an all-star skating tribunal bans the brute and the femme from competition. But a loophole emerges They may compete in pairs skating BACKSTORY Though same-sex figure-skating pairs arent exactly mascots of the U.S. Figure Skating Association the Gay Games have long featured such teams (plus man-and-woman pairings). But the most recent Gay Games were preceded by a controversy involving two skaters Alan Lessik and John Manzon-Santos. The men settled a discrimination suit against a California ice rink after claiming that employees there had told them to stop holding hands. The rinks response? All skating pairs are a safety threat to other skaters. But it later apologized and agreed to host a weekly gay-straight skate night. Blades of Glory is far more conventional than its predecessors which were directed and co-written by Ferrells steady collaborator Adam McKay. The odd-couple buddy premise is flabby and the film has no spasms of genius to equal the stylings of Sacha Baron Cohen as a prim gay French existentialist car-racer in Talladega Nights or the news teams impromptu a cappella Afternoon Delight in Anchorman. But the laughs glide in one after another. The directors Will Speck and Josh Gordon nail the subtext and straight-faced deportment of Ferrells best movies. Although Im not sure Heders dorky mouth-breather shtickthe joke is hes both spacey and pricklyhas much stretch his slumpy affect and stringy frame match up wondrously with Ferrells beefiness. Theres a hetero romance between emotionally abused ingenues Jimmy and a radiantly pretty Jenna Fischer as the sister of a conniving brother-sister skating team. But thats window dressing. What powers the movie are the gross-out gagsapproach the revelation of the ultimate skating move the Iron Lotus with cautionand the scenes in which each man learns to overcome his revulsion to touching/being touched by another dude. Im looking forward to buying Blades of Glory on DVD so I can get my head around the phenomenal skating routines. Obviously there were wires and lifts and computer-generated effects but for my money it looked like the lumbering Ferrell and nerdy Heder were Olympic-worthy stylists. The triple lutzes make the heart leap. The climactic ice danceto Queens immortal theme from Flash Gordon (Flash Ah-ahhhh Savior of the universe)might be the apotheosis of man-boy love. Platonic of course as befits the idealized medium of ice-skating. Bringing off a con-man saga involves quite a bit of con artistry. There is the matter of sweetening the protagonist who is ripping off innocent people and/or taking credit for other peoples achievements. There is the inevitability of the comeuppance. In the sixties and early seventies con artists were counterculture heroes sticking it to the Man but nowadays were all Enron victims and James Frey haters. So its bracing to see a grand con-man comedy like The Hoax in which our moral universe is affirmed and yet the fabled trickster Clifford Irvingwho wrote a fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughesis so darn likable. It helps that Irving is played by Richard Gere a much-underrated actor who learned as the villain of Internal Affairs to harness his Methody contortions and underplay slyly. Now he gives out emotion in tiny beams; hes a glimmer man. In Lasse Hallstroms film (the screenplay by William Wheeler is based on Irvings account) Irving has a notion thats nine parts insane to one part inspired that Hughes is too much of a recluse to contest a fake autobiography. He thinks up the scam after a novel hes on the verge of selling to Houghton Mifflin is cruelly rejected leaving him with a new Mercedes convertible and spiraling debts. So he persuades his buddy Richard Suskind (Alfred Molina) to help him researchand in effect speak forthe worlds most storied and elusive weirdo. In their press notes the filmmakers have the decency to spell out their own liberties with the truth. I begrudge them none except the revelation that Irving in fact had a four-book contract with Houghton Mifflin There is a difference between a scheme cooked up in repose and one born of farcical desperation. That said its the element of farce that gives The Hoax its often-hilarious drive. As skepticism mounts Irving must think on his feet concocting ever more outlandish accounts of furtive meetings with the capricious germaphobic billionaire. Gere plays Irving as a smoothie a master juggler (hes also juggling a mistress played by a mouthwatering Julie Delpy) but hes saddled with Molinas Suskind a mopey exhibitionist whos so sure of failure that he does what he canunconsciouslyto bring it about. The movies neat little fillip is that as Irving dictates the book he begins to dress and talk like Hughesto channel Hughes. Maybe thats why Geres performance feels so impish. Its a Method satire. (Its also true to Irvings bogus bookavailable on his Websitewhich rings with conviction.) 1 2 Next Share this story...

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Friday March 30 2007 400 AM View the gallery ""Blades of Glory"" Slapstick comedy about rival figure skaters who team up as pairs after being banned from mens singles. With Will Ferrell Jon Heder Craig T. Nelson. Directors Josh Gordon Will Speck (133). PG-13 Language drug references. At area theaters. The premise for the broad comedy ""Blades of Glory"" in which Will Ferrell and Jon Heder play figure skatings first same-sex pairs team was about the most depressing thing that appeared on the 2007 release schedule. Then came the trailer which seemed to confirm my fear that the film would simply be a collection of nose-to-crotch sight gags. Well the movies here along with a few of those gags. But the casting of Ferrell and Heder turns out to be inspired. The direction by a pair of NYU grads whove only made TV commercials and two short films is pitch-perfect. And - miraculously - the skating sequences are passably realistic. Ive admitted to a degree of Ferrell fatigue in the past and he does rehash a lot of his old shtick here. But this is the first time he has been paired on equal footing with another comedy actor and the chemistry with Heder works so well that it elevates both of them. Though the movie spoofs the glittery elegance and ritual tradition of figure skating its tone is never mocking. I think figure-skating fans (Ill ask my wife) are going to find it almost endearing. Ferrell and Heder play caricatures that show the extremes of male skaters. Ferrell is Chazz Michael Michaels a macho braggart who makes vulgar love to the audience while Heder is Jimmy MacElroy a classically trained rhinestone-adorned finesse artist. (Real-life skater Scott Hamilton plays a TV commentator and several other skaters have cameos.) The two stars were Americas top mens singles skaters until they got in a fight on the victory stand and were banned from the sport for life. Or so they thought. A check of the rule book three years later alerts someone to the fact that they could still compete in pairs. Desperate to skate again they team up. Naturally the larger Chazz is the male lead while Jimmy is the one being twirled overhead and slung in arcs. Their unique routine includes a maneuver called the Iron Lotus which has only been attempted in competition once and in that instance - as we see in mock news footage - one partner was decapitated. This routine would be dangerous enough but Chazz and Jimmys pairs rivals the brother/sister team of Stranz and Fairchild (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) will stop at nothing to sabotage them. The script credits more writers than I have room to name but the movie works as well as it does because of the direction of Josh Gordon and Will Speck who received an Oscar nomination for their 1998 short ""Culture"" and have worked steadily for Ridley Scotts TV commercials firm. That experience stood them well for the challenge of creating the seamless illusions of skating performance in ""Blades."" Production notes tell us that Ferrell and Heder spent months learning how to skate well enough to stay on their feet and it is hard to know when their doubles take over for them.

Photo Photo Credit Suzanne Hanover Suzanne Hanover Blades of Glory 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Some movies need to exist. These would include Bringing Up Baby and The Godfather. Others do not need to exist. These would include any poufy-headed parody of competitive figure skating even if it stars Will Ferrell as ""sex on ice"" and offers a comic decapitation scene set in North Korea. Its nothing political -- just some grainy footage of the infamous ""Iron Lotus"" a competition stunt in which the male athlete slingshots the female athlete into a massive aerial flip only to accidentally liberate her head with his skate. Nice move pal. If youre wondering what the Zamboni has to do with our aforementioned Ferrell in a unitard dont worry he is not the decapitator although he finds himself in the position of likely decapitatee a couple reels on. ""I swear to God if you cut my head off ... "" he barks issuing this unfinished threat to an equally unitarded Jon Heder. Heders character Jimmy MacElroy is a prissy perfectionist with large blond hair. Ferrells character Chazz Michael Michaels is an egomaniacal sex-fanatical oaf with large brown hair. Jimmy skates in rhinestones and feathers with an occasional live bird thrown in for good measure; Chazz skates in tight leather get-ups and spangled cowboy hats. Together they look like Starsky and Hutch in the aftermath of a tragic glitter incident. Directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck in their feature debut Blades of Glory began as a script by five people but more accurately hails from that graceful tacky mingling of soap-operatic tantrums and sport. The films chief idea besides the decapitation trick and the shots of Ferrells wooly gut in a leopard-print towel is that two clueless male fashion crises might skate together as a pair when they get booted from individual competition. The problem arises when they pound each other bloody after an event in Stockholm after which theyre banned for life by a star chamber packed with skating-personality cameos. Three and a half years later Jimmy slaves in a ski shop while Chazz skates sloshed as the evil wizard in a kids show called Grublets on Ice Hear him puke inside his costume. At the urging of a helpful stalker (Nick Swardson) Jimmy pursues a loophole that would allow him to compete in pairs competition. At the urging of a determined coach (Craig T. Nelson who else?) he takes on Chazz as a partner. They then proceed to double-axel their way to glory if by ""glory"" we mean impossibly gaudy routines aided by plentiful CGI and elastic skate doubles. At some point the head-removing maneuver plays a key role as do Jenna Fischer (as a love interest) and an odious brother-sister skating duo played by Amy Poehler and Will Arnett -- snug inside their purple feather boas. This is all a load of fluff. Its predictable. Its ridiculous. It has not the slimmest tether to reality and it features one crotch joke too many (or maybe 10). Blades of Glory is too broad to be satire and not mean enough by half -- in any case competitive figure skating already does a pretty good job spoofing itself. But there are laughs to be enjoyed here and there are non sequiturs to admire and there are Heder and Ferrell in rocket-equipped Flash Gordon flight suits with blinking fairy lights. Two weirder sweeter nitwits do not exist on skates. We dont need them but they seem to need each other. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Columbia Rapid Rivers II Mens Shirt for 20 + free shipping American Airlines Nationwide Fares from 38 1-way Marc New York Womens Lace Sheath Dress for 26 + 8 samp;h Banzai Wigglin Water Sprinkler for 7 + pickup at Walmart Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Ones ice. Ones blond the other brunet. One was raised on Detroits mean streets. The other was plucked from an orphanage by a freak of wealth and ambition. They despise the other. But once they fall on hard times each needs the other. Can their driven coach make their volatile chemistry work in the ultra-Lycra-clad world of competitive figure skating? Right about now Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney should be triple axeling in their graves. Wait they arent dead. But the battling leads in 1992s now-campy wonder ""The Cutting Edge"" will recognize what they and their Coach Anton Pamchenko wrought when they see ""Blades of Glory."" This perfectly silly spoof of competitive figure skating stars Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as Chazz Michael Michaels and Jim MacElroy the first male pair in the sports history. Coach - and by that we mean Craig T. Nelson - plays their reluctant then dedicated coach. As far as we know the movie is the only sports inspirational to come out this year not based on a true story. Yet like a slew of guy-anxiety comedies (""Old School"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") it toys with and jests about present-day issues of masculinity. Even so contrary to the quasi-provocative notion of two guys partnering up theres little cutting edge in ""Blades of Glory."" This is a good thing. The ice so many comedies skate on can be thin. And trailers suggested ""Blades"" might be one long gay joke. Instead directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon (making their feature debut) the comedy plunges so deep into lame (lame?) it comes out on the side of fangless fun. Some of the tartest lines come early as Scott Hamilton and Jim Lampley provide color commentary for the championship that leads to Chazz and Jimmys exile. And from start to finale the movie nails its spoofy leaps about Olympic telecasts and their overheated profiles. So how ready and willing were skatings royalty to embrace the ribbing? Well Dorothy Hamill Brian Boitano Peggy Fleming and Nancy Kerrigan all make game appearances here. Granted they are the judges who bar Chazz and Jimmy from the sport forever. (Sacha Cohen also has a cameo.) Rated PG-13 ""Blades"" is more petulant and pouty than cruel. The macho sass comes by way of Ferrells character. Chazz proves the tattooed yang to Jimmys yen for pastels. ""A tsunami of swagger"" as one announcer puts it Chazz has impulse-control issues. Hes a sex addict a crotch-grabber. He choreographs his routines to songs like Billy Squires ""The Stroke."" His idiots riff on the allure of the Black Eyed Peas ""My Humps"" (featured on the trailer) still gets giggles. During the ban Chazz makes his living at a Grublets on Ice capade. Faring no better Jimmy fumbles around at a sporting goods store. Even his onetime stalker (Nick Swardson) knows a loophole is needed. Although his bouffant alone could earn its own SAG card Heders Jimmy is the comedic straight man to Ferrells Chazz. Will Arnett and Amy Poehler play the duos rivals icky siblings Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg. Kate their sane sensible and cute sis (Jenna Fischer) will catch Jimmys eye. But will she break up the pair? Once Chazz tells his fallen partner ""Hey dude take my hand"" its ""game on."" The movie muscle-glides toward the showdown in Montreal. There Chazz and Jimmy will attempt a revolutionary death spiral a throw-jump thingy cooked up by Coach. The Iron Lotus makes the Pamchenko look like childs play. Their obsessed - and traumatized it turns out - coach tells them the move has been attempted only in one nation. To tell you where would blunt the joke. Lets just say the move threatens to put the ""cut"" back in cutting edge.

Heder in a bleached-blond hairdo the likes of which havent been seen since ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" What are two hockey pucks doing in a film about figure skating? Will Ferrell and Jon Heder star as rivals-turned-partners in ""Blades of Glory"" a movie that was a hit as soon as the posters went up. Ferrell in a body stocking. Heder in a bleached-blond hairdo the likes of which havent been seen since ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" There may be an overabundance of pain jokes crotch jokes and painful crotch jokes but at the end of the program this Will Speck-Josh Gordon-directed farce is the triple axel of comedy. Even if the heroes do fall down a lot. There may be no aspect of modern life that eventually wont be sat on by the professionally ungainly Ferrell who has wrapped his half-shaved bear of a self around Christmas (""Elf"") TV news (""Anchorman"") and NASCAR (""Talladega Nights"") over the past few years. (He will turn his dubious attentions toward the NBA in the upcoming ""Semi-Pro."") Meanwhile squatting upon the seemingly genteel world of ice skating Ferrell is in his element a walking (gliding) contradiction the personification of physical unease dropped into the worlds most graceful sport. Ferrell plays Chazz Michael Michaels the bad boy of the rink an overly oiled sex machine who resembles a late-era Jim Morrison and needs only a mid-rink dance pole to complete his mutation from skater to stripper. Jimmy MacElroy (Heder) his chief rival is his polar opposite As a child prodigy Jimmy was adopted by skating promoter Darren MacElroy (a marvelously unctuous William Fichtner) and raised to be an ""uber-skater"" whose entire act is so effeminate it can only raise a sneer from Chazz. Naturally they will become partners in a ""Zoolander""-inspired parade of posing spinning camel-ing and lutzing but only after a total meltdown. Having tied for gold at a (fictitious) world competition Chazz and Jimmy jostle shove and topple off the podium wrestling around on the ice to the horror of computer-multiplied thousands. Ultimately they are banned for life by a committee that includes Peggy Fleming Dorothy Hamill Brian Boitano and Nancy Kerrigan. Chazz becomes even more of a drunk performing in a childrens ice show and throwing up inside his costume (hes like Bad Santa in cold storage) while Jimmy goes to work in a skate shop. They are on their way to becoming either has-beens or sports announcers when Coach (an apt name for Craig T. Nelsons character) comes up with a scheme The two may well be banned from mens singles but not from doubles. Nothing in the rules says skating partners have to be male and female so why dont they return to the ice as the first same-sex team on the international circuit? Holy Adam and Steve The conflict in the film -- as if there werent enough already -- arrives via the archly villainous and vaguely incestuous brother-sister duo of Stranz amp; Fairchild Van Waldenberg (real-life marrieds Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) the reigning king and queen of pairs skating. Fairchild will do anything to keep her position as empress of the ice; Stranz is too stupid to do anything but follow her lead and further oppress their younger sister Katie (Jenna Fischer) the good girl who becomes Jimmys love interest. As good as Ferrell and Heder are without such potent supporting characters ""Blades of Glory"" would never score quite as high as it no doubt will at the box office. Nor would it succeed as well without the subtly awkward special effects -- the skating by Ferrell Heder Poehler and Arnett is just this side of totally plausible. The technology undoubtedly exists to make a Teamster skate like Sasha Cohen (who has a very funny cameo) but the laughs would be lost without a certain amount of nod and wink about the relation between these actors and the ice. The one drawback is that the implicit movie-long gag about how ridiculous it is to watch men dance with each other may strike some auds as one long unspoken but obvious gay joke -- and they wouldnt be far off. Production qualities are first-rate and the costumes by Julie Weiss are informed by a knowledge of how ostentatious skaters outfits really are -- her work is all the more hilarious for it. Again the very idea of Will Ferrell on figure skates was a high-scoring concept before it ever left the pitch meeting. Dont expect much except laughs.

"Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory. Slate Sign In Sign Up Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory. Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 29 2007 618 PM Against Sequins Will Ferrell in the ice-skating comedy Blades of Glory. By Dana Stevens Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory I hope Blades of Glory (Paramount Pictures) isnt what it seems to be the film that marks the moment the bloom came off Will Ferrells rose. Its possible that this movies wan air of mildewed familiarity is merely a fluke. If nothing else Blades of Glorys semi-funniness is a sign that Ferrell should hang onto the phone number of his longtime collaborator Adam McKay whos been writing with the comic since their SNL days and who wrote and directed both Anchorman and Talladega Nights. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Blades is scripted by a too-many-cooks team of four writers and directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon commercial directors who were responsible for those Geico cavemen TV spots that as Slates Seth Stevenson observed last week hint at the presence of ""someone (or someones) with a wonderful comic sensibility."" If the Geico cavemen land the prime-time sitcom currently in development at ABC Gordon and Speck may get a chance to display that sensibility again. But theres not a moment in their first feature film thats worth the cavemans stare at the end of that ""roast duck with mango salsa"" ad. Advertisement If youve seen a movie a TV show or the side of a bus in the past month you already know the premise of Blades of Glory Will Ferrell is Chazz Michael Michaels a hard-drinking fist-pumping figure skater who power-shimmies to Billy Squiers ""The Stroke"" before screaming female fans. Jon Heder best known to most viewers as the scrawny slack-jawed Napoleon Dynamite plays Jimmy MacElroy an orphan skating prodigy with a bleach-blond winged hairdo whose taste runs more to Rachmaninoff and peacock feathers. When the two rivals tie for a gold medal at the world championships they break out in a fight during the medal ceremony and get themselves banned from the sport forever. That is until a stalker fan of Jimmys (a guy who calls out ""Im still going to kill you someday"" by way of affectionate farewell) discovers a loophole in the regulation book that would allow the two men to return to the sport as part of a paired team. But since there isnt time for them each to locate and train a female partner--a confusing plot point thats glossed over in the script--Chazz and Jimmy wind up in training as the first-ever man-on-man figure-skating couple. After this cursory setup Blades of Glory skates by--forgive me but its true--on one joke the notion that two men figure skating together (and lets face it the sport of figure skating in general) is really kind of gay. The problem with this joke is not that its homophobic but that its weak. Ferrells last film Talladega Nights was braver and hence funnier in its treatment of American homosexual panic. There the hero NASCAR driver Ricky Bobby was forced to confront a real gay man in the form of Sacha Baron Cohens French Formula 1 champion. Ricky Bobby had to rethink his notion of masculinity when that espresso-sipping Camus-reading rival proved fully capable of kicking his ass. The Ferrell/Baron Cohen matchup in Talladega Nights--not to mention the nude wrestling scene in Borat--have pushed this genre of joke to such an extreme that the old Friends-style homophobia gag (""We are straight men yet we find ourselves in a situation that makes us seem gay Whatever shall we do?"") feels hoary and vaudevillian. Of course no project involving Ferrell is going to be entirely unfunny and Blades of Glory does have its moments of loopy ingenuity even if none of them goes quite far enough. A scene in which Chazz shows Jimmy his 12000 Italian hairbrush (""I love this brush far more than I could ever love any human baby"") might have developed in a better movie into a full-fledged hair-care subplot. The costumes and music choices are consistently inspired particularly Heders sky-blue fluffy-collared training ensembles and Ferrells treadmill-bound cover version of ""My Humps"" (see Josh Levins slide show for a clip of this scene). Advertisement Will Arnett and his real-life spouse Amy Poehler play the rival pairs team Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg a brother and sister with an incestuous vibe and no qualms about using Tonya Harding methods to disable the competition. As he proved in Arrested Development (God rest its soul) Arnett can play a dimwitted openly ruthless villain like nobodys business. His physical-comedy skills are superb most notably in a very slow chase scene that departs from the fact that skates are impossible to walk on as soon as you leave the ice. Jenna Fischer from The Office toils thanklessly in a straight role as Stranz and Fairchilds compliant younger sister Katie. In a scripting misstep typical of this kind of thrown-together comedy Katie is written as such a thoroughgoing wimp that its hard to root for her or to care whether she and the virginal Jimmy overcome the obstacles to their love. Not to point to Anchorman and Talladega Nights yet again but they do serve as examples of the axiom that in good comedy even the small roles matter. The actors did their own skating in some scenes. In others they were digitally combined with stunt doubles to lend verisimilitude to the trickier moves on ice (like the legendary ""Iron Lotus"" jump that Chazz and Jimmy struggle to land without decapitating one another). There are also brief cameos from real-life skaters like Brian Boitano Scott Hamilton Peggy Fleming Nancy Kerrigan and Sasha Cohen (who as a love-struck Chazz Michael Michaels fan gamely sniffs Ferrells jockstrap). As far as the above-mentioned bloom-is-off-the-rose theory goes Im by no means anxious to proclaim an end to Will Ferrells golden age. May he play the doughy oaf involved in a random new sports activity in many films to come. I just dont want him to get lazy about it.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor March 30 2007 Save for later Saved The idea of male pairs figure skaters is such a funny concept that it would have taken a considerably worse movie than ""Blades of Glory"" to flatten it. Throw in the fact that Will Ferrell and Jon Heder play the two skaters and you have a potentially great comedy.Well ""Blades of Glory"" is not great - its often not even very good. The codirectors Will Speck and Josh Gordon are so carried away with the funniness of its concept that they often settle for half measures. The timing is slack and the jokes repetitive. But like most Will Ferrell movies it has enough riotous moments to carry you through the dull stretches.Things begin promisingly as we see a young boy executing triple lutzes on the frozen pond at an orphanage. Flash forward to the present and that boy is now champion figure skater Jimmy MacElroy (Heder) who favors sequined outfits with tufted plumage. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? His rival and nemesis is Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) who is the ying to Jimmys yang. With his leather duds and cowboy swagger Chazz is so macho that his female fans can barely contain themselves as he swivels his way across the ice. When he and Jimmy tie for first place at the world championships (the film is careful to avoid any prominent reference to the Olympics) they break into a slugfest on the winners podium and are banned from the sport for life. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Both skaters go on the skids. Jimmy works in the shoe department of a sporting-goods store; Chazz dresses up as a meanie in a kiddie ice review. Then Jimmys resident stalker figures out a loophole that will get his idol back in the rink The skating bylaws dont prohibit him from pairs competition. Of course we know who his partner will be.The best sequences in ""Blades of Glory"" are the odd couple confrontations between these two loonies as they attempt to overcome their intense dislike for each other and grab the gold. Ferrell and Heder are such polar opposites that just seeing them stand side by side is often enough to provoke titters. Jimmy with his blond coif is as fey as Chazz is surly. When they do their flips and lutzes their slapstick ballet is (crackpot) poetry in motion.Even though these skating scenes employ ample computer-generated effects there are still plenty of sidesplitting close-ups of Ferrell at his most mock intense. Heder is a less-skilled comic performer so theres a mismatch in this duet. But its difficult for anybody to go up against Ferrell when hes really cooking. And even though hes only at half boil here thats plenty. Grade B Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor language a comic violent image and some drug references.

"Double Lutzes Blades of Glory washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Double Lutzes Blades of Glory What a pair Will Ferrell and Jon Heder in ""Blades."" (By Melinda Sue Gordon -- Dreamworks) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 30 2007 I can guarantee that ""Blades of Glory"" is two times funnier than the average American comedy. Thats because it has two jokes instead of one. The first is When straight men flounce its funny. It just is. Sorry dont shoot the messenger but at least to some its always funny. The movies high jinks come when Will Ferrell and Jon Heder sashay into the graceful world of figure skating and camp it up like a convention of Liberace impersonators though the script is at pains to keep them nominally hetero. Figure skating like ballet while demanding the highest in athleticism strength stamina and courage at the same time requires men to place their bodies into positions that they might not naturally assume. Its style for men is gay. Things that dont usually stick out must be stuck out; things that dont usually dangle must be dangled; things that dont normally arch must be arched. For this reason and the uneasiness that many heterosexuals still feel even in these enlightened times about behavior slightly tinted with lavender the two activities are the focus of much he-boy mirth. Shamelessly Ferrell and Heder give themselves over to this practice. They play figure skating competitors and the endless hilarity is visual those awkward self-conscious hetero male bodies ill-formed and quaking with reluctance thrown into a gossamer flutter of swanlike routines clumsily syncopating themselves to the fantasy that they are light and graceful when as all can see and laugh at they are hopeless clueless and graceless. To see seemingly reglar guys utterly stripped of dignity and defense is cruel enough but crueler still is the laughter that you cannot seem to stop from rupturing your lungs and aorta. The costumes meanwhile look like they were designed by Salvador Dali high on absinthe and cocaine with an unlimited sparkle budget. But thats any figure skating costume isnt it? As the plot has it the two -- who for reasons soon to be disclosed (joke No. 2) are banned from the rink -- find a loophole that permits them back onto the ice to skate as a team since the male-female linkage is only a tradition and not a rule. Thus though they hate each other they team up boy-boy and all that intimate face-in-crotch and hand-on-butt stuff thats so stimulating to us when its across the boy-girl chasm suddenly becomes hysterical when its boy-boy and each guy is so desperate that he has to go forward with it. Other peoples misfortune is so amusing As the movie has it the lumbering hairy Ferrell plays the overcompensating Chazz Michael Michaels an ""outlaw"" skater who has invented a persona as the Mick Jagger of the figure skating world. The joke is that his machismo is mostly fantasy and his hyper-masculinity is all the more off-putting for being fraudulent. Heder still looking for a hit to cement his career after ""Napoleon Dynamite"" plays Jimmy MacElroy slighter wispier more graceful more girly. Again its funny seeing the lanky Heder trying desperately to achieve the fairy-princess sparkly grace necessary for the demanding sport. The fact that he gets a little closer than Ferrell actually makes him funnier; when he goes into his tra-la-la on the ice -- theyre both shameless I should add -- sticking his tushie out and making like a princess cygnet with his flappity-flapping arms as his chiffon costume trails tendrils in the wind and his cupid-blond hair gently vibrates hes a thing of non-beauty and a joy forever. Joke No. 2 the endless humor of immature hostility. Jimmy and Chazz hate each other so much that they cant control themselves but theyre so stupid and inarticulate that their zingers dont zing. Frustrated they just cant keep from acting out and while sharing the podium after a tie for gold they begin rolling around on the ice throwing ill-timed punches scratching each others eyes kneeing each others crotches. They look like cats fighting in a bag and its not pretty (hence their ban from singles competition). Much of the movies humor comes from their complete inability to control their emotions which spurt out all the time in messy childish disarray. Men behaving badly a surefire laugh-getter. The filmmakers -- the directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck and it seems about six different teams worked on the script -- bring in a semblance of plot at the halfway point. Chazz and Jimmy are opposed in their aspirations to return to the top by the brother-sister team of Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler of ""SNL"") who turn out to be ruthless nasty and mean always fine comic attributes. Far from being ruthless nasty and mean our heroes deserve to win because they are stupid narcissistic and selfish. William Fichtner has a nice spin as Jimmys ruthless nasty and mean adoptive father who abandons him when he is kicked out of skating and Craig T. Nelson who plays either coaches or cops here plays a coach to decent effect. Seventy-nine-year-old William Daniels one of the best character actors in the history of movies has a nice little role. Jenna Fischer whom some will spot as Pam from TVs ""The Office"" plays the Van Waldenbergs wallflower sister with a thing for Jimmy. More than a few members of the figure skating community -- Dorothy Hamill Peggy Fleming Scott Hamilton Brian Boitano and Nancy Kerrigan -- show up to prove theyre good sports and the beautiful Sasha Cohen has a funny cameo at the end thats worth waiting for. Blades of Glory (93 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor profanity and some drug references. Also the mascot Snowflake gets an arrow in the head.

NelsonParamount Pictures Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Suzanne Hanover) C- Blades of Glory Genre Comedy; Starring Will Ferrell Jon Heder Jenna Fischer Amy Poehler Craig T. Nelson; Director Josh Gordon Will Speck; Author Craig Cox Jeff Cox; Release Date Wide 03/30/2007; Runtime (in minutes) 93; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted March 30 2007 -- 1200 AM EDT In Blades of Glory Jon Heder he of the adorable rabbit teeth and gently peeved nasal whine may have ditched his Napoleon Dynamite curls but he still knows how to take a cue from his hair -- in this case a frosted 70s princess mop that makes him look like Sandy Duncan with a touch of Marcia Wallace on the old Bob Newhart Show. As Jimmy MacElroy a figure skater known for his seamless twirls and glides Heder is introduced in a skintight peacock getup of resplendent silliness bedecked with giant sequins and a big flaming tail. When he flaps his ""wings"" to the soaring strains of ""Con Te Partiro"" it may be wrong to say so but Ill say it anyway He looks about as gay as a jaybird in May. Will Ferrell with those dots of eyes furrowed into mean slits is Chazz Michael Michaels Jimmys butch counterpart -- a pudgy cantankerous ruffian who skates with cowboy/bruiser/Saturday Night Fever moves that are if anything just a bit less ridiculous than Jimmys peacock posing. Chazz tends his dirty biker hair with horse shampoo and tosses horny insults at anyone who doesnt see his macho splendor. Hes also a sex addict who when he spots Nancy Kerrigan hits her with the line ""You an official here? Because you have officially given me a boner"" That sums up Ferrells performance As Chazz hes a tool though that doesnt mean hes anything less than a girly man on ice. At the World Wintersport Games Chazz and Jimmy share the gold medal and when their appearance on the podium turns into a brawl both are banned from solo competitive skating for life. But theres a loophole They can still compete in teams and since no one wants to partner with either of the disgraced duo they put their mutual hatred on hold to become the first male-male figure-skating team in the history of the sport. Giggling at the pouffy-sleeved muscle-buffed vanity of male figure skaters may be a bit of a cheap shot but as cheap shots go it isnt a bad one. Blades of Glory is a farce of preening emasculation in spandex. It is also undeniably a mild comedy of homosexual panic though in a place as sexually clenched as America no one from either the left or the right has much to fear from a good honest gay-anxiety joke. Remember the one that popped up in the middle of the Super Bowl -- that commercial with two men nibbling away at different ends of a candy bar only to end up in a kiss? It tickled you in two directions at once turning homophobia into a sly what if? There are moments in Blades of Glory with a similar effect. Basically though this is a one-joke movie directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon with zero visual sparkle and too much dead weight between its handful of nimble sequences. When Chazz and Jimmy hit the ice together its the payoff weve been waiting for and the movie doesnt disappoint. Ferrell and Heder who did some of their own skating are digitally blended with stunt doubles which gives them the look of an Olympiad Siegfried amp; Roy. Chazz to his horror finds his face opposite body parts he never wanted to be half that close to and the duets poses are ripe indeed especially when Jimmy takes on the figure of a swan getting lovingly...goosed. The movie is funniest when it aims for doofy-surreal balletic farce -- when it revels in lyrical slapstick and turns into a comedy of movement of men gone femme. Off the ice though Blades of Glory is cautious and rather flat. I kept wishing that the film had been directed by Christopher Guest the Farrelly brothers or the Ben Stiller of Zoolander who did zingier nut-brained riffs on the vacuousness of fashion-world metrosexuality. (Stiller is one of the producers here.) Its time for Will Ferrell to stop letting his belly hang out -- or at least to stop thinking that doing so is enough to qualify for a ""fearless"" laugh. His macho send-up made sense in Talladega Nights but he plays Chazz as such a toxic bullhead (would someone like this become a figure skater?) that he seems to be overcompensating for the effeminacy of the subject. As for Heder he finds few shadings within his honeyed passivity. Blades of Glory has its diversions like Amy Poehler and Will Arnett as the brother-sister team of Fairchild and Stranz Van Waldenberg who are such arrested babies they dont even realize theyre in lust with each other. Arnett especially gives his evil skating dandy a touch of antic depravity and theres a good bit where he and Ferrell hobble through a lobby on skates in a riotously clunky chase. Blades of Glory has funny moves even when its characters can barely move but the film seldom gets past its one basic laugh that a real man figure-skating is a contradiction in terms.
