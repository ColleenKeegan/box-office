Hes Roger a parking attendant who cant approach his attractive neighbour Amanda (Jacinda Barrett) without passing out. A whisper from an acquaintance leads him to the titular classes run by the macho Dr P (Billy Bob Thornton) a sort of underground version of Tom Cruises guru in Magnolia.In theory Dr P teaches Roger and a bunch of wimps how to gain confidence but his methods are unusual at best (he pages them at random ordering them to start a fight). Complications ensue when Roger succeeds in class and Dr P views him as competition. An underhand fight ensues with the Amanda as the prize.Its the stuff of simple comedy but as frat-flicks go its a return to form for director Todd Phillips who followed Road Trip and Old School with the flimsy Starsky amp; Hutch. A likeable lead Heder has us rooting for Rogers transformation from the start and Thornton is a sinister rival. The narrative drags towards the end however and theres little in the way of clever wordplay or piercing observation it relies on slapstick for laughs and none of them reach the point of hilarity. Enjoyable but unambitious School for Scoundrels lacks a competitive drive and yes youve seen all the best jokes in the trailer.

(AP Photo/The Weinstein Company/Tracy Bennett less In this photo provided by The Weinstein Company Roger (John Hederleft) enrolls in a class to build confidence to help win over the girl of his dreams (Jacinda Barrett) which becomes complicated when his ... more Photo TRACY BENNETT No humor no point in going to School 1 / 1 Back to Gallery School for Scoundrels Comedy. Starring Jon Heder Billy Bob Thornton Jacinda Barrett Sarah Silverman and Ben Stiller. Directed by Todd Phillips. (PG-13. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""A Thousand Clowns"" Jason Robards noted that ""If things arent funny ... theyre like a long dental appointment."" ""School for Scoundrels"" falsely advertised as a comedy fits his description. It would require a near-lethal injection of nitrous oxide to induce laughter. Pairing Jon Heder -- a teen icon since the surprise popularity of his ""Napoleon Dynamite"" -- with Billy Bob Thornton had potential. The ultra-cool Billy Bob could have been a perfect foil for his goofy young co-star Martin amp; Lewis redux. But like everything else in this bogus comedy the casting fails to ignite. Hampered by an ill-conceived script that mushily defines their characters Heder and Thornton are ineffectual at bringing out each others inherent ability to be silly. With his basset hound face and jerky body movements Heder looks the part of a super-shy nerdy New York City parking meter attendant. Roger is given to panic attacks when caught in the act of slapping a ticket on a windshield. After three youngsters in a row fire him as their volunteer Big Brother he enrolls in a course to build self-esteem taught by the mysterious Dr. P. (Thornton). The students are dumb enough or desperate enough to hand him 5000. In return Dr. P. tells them that they suck. For homework they study his rules on how to get a girl into bed -- beginning with lie lie and lie some more. The setup isnt bad and made for a decent enough comedy when it was trotted out the first time in a 1960 British comedy of the same title. But the latest ""Scoundrels"" takes a disastrous turn when Dr. P. puts the moves on Rogers fetching neighbor Amanda (Jacinda Barrett) whom Roger is smitten with. (In the original version which was written by Peter Ustinov the students rival for a beautiful womans affections is someone outside of class not his teacher and supposed ally.) Whatever humor might have been extracted from the premise of a school for losers run by a bully is subverted by reducing Dr. P. to just another horny guy. Midway through ""Scoundrels"" becomes a different movie about an elaborate kidnapping plan engineered by Roger and his classmates who smarten up awfully quick to prevent Amanda from accompanying Dr. P. to Florida. Following his own No. 1 rule he has convinced her that hes a doctor ministering to sick young kids. Director Todd Phillips demonstrated that he knows how to hook young male audiences in ""Old School"" and ""Starsky and Hutch."" As if realizing that hes losing them Phillips brings in Ben Stiller as a last-ditch effort. He has a small role as a former student of Dr. P.s reduced to living like a hermit since his girlfriend jilted him for his instructor. To get even he agrees to surreptitiously help Roger nail Dr. P. Theres no question that given the right material Stiller can do funny. Here he has been given a singularly unfunny rant about how veterans of the war in Grenada (like his character) never got the respect they deserve. The few women in the cast are given precious little to do. Barrett smiles a lot in contrast to stand-up comic Sarah Silverman as Amandas scowling sarcastic roommate. Silverman whose potty mouth made her a standout in the documentary ""The Aristocrats"" struggles unsuccessfully to come across as more than just a caricature of an angry New Yorker. The script doesnt bother to develop Rogers fellow classmates into people you might care about. So an epilogue describing what becomes of them is as pointless as everything that precedes it. -- Advisory Language and mild sexual situations.

A teacher (Billy Bob Thornton right) with a conflict of interest teaches a wimp (Jon Heder) the art of conflict in School for Scoundrels. Photo MGM School for Scoundrels 1 / 1 Back to Gallery News flash Nice guys finish last. Before you choke on your milquetoast let me amend that. Nice guys finish last -- unless they sign up for sleazeball-instruction classes taught by an abusive creep. Once they learn how to be violent and vindictive liars these soon-to-be-former nice guys can then use their newfound skills to snare lovely maidens and make sure the abusive creep has reason to writhe on the ground clutching his tender bits. This is especially true when the creep is played by Billy Bob Thornton who needs to wear less pancake makeup and the nice guy is played by Jon Heder who needs to wear less bangs. The premise underpinning School for Scoundrels is the forlorn wussiness of Heders character a New York City parking violations officer named Roger. He worships a gorgeous neighbor (Jacinda Barrett) but can only manage panic attacks in her presence. Not the stuff of fantasy. When a know-it-all acquaintance gives him the phone number of a helpful contact Roger throws wimpiness to the wind and signs up for a Learning Annex class on how to be a selfish pig. The class is taught by the mysterious Dr. P (Thornton) who tells his pupils to forget all their Tony Robbins fantasies of self-improvement (""You cant help yourself because your self sucks"") and turn toward the meatier business of stalking prey. He shows them slides of lions savaging zebras. He tells them to provoke fights. Then he sends his younglings into the wilderness with a bunch of paintball guns which they shoot point-blank into each others chests crotches foreheads the odd ear whatever. While out in the woods Dr. Ps burly assistant (Michael Clarke Duncan) forces three of them to drop their pants bend over and (perhaps) submit to his will. The scene doesnt go all the way but rape is a punch line thereafter. And well ick. Jokes about rape are a deal-breaker. Any film that trades on them ceases to be funny. School for Scoundrels was directed by Todd Phillips who also helmed the sophomorically amusing Old School and the not-even Starsky and Hutch. I sense a theme emerging (men behaving badly) but I also sense a director who needs to cast his films wisely. Thornton is a mistake. Its not that he isnt believable as a cur; its not that he cant act. He is and he can. But when the script -- by Phillips and Scot Armstrong based on the 1960 adaptation of Stephen Potters veddy British novels -- requires him to turn on the charm he lacks conviction and the film lacks sense turning twisty and illogical and aerated with holes. As for Roger Heder is as Heder does He further hones the sweet-geek routine that made him a star in Napoleon Dynamite. Hes credible as a nerd of course but he acquits himself well as a romantic interest too; his scenes with the carbonated Barrett (who bubbles even at rest) are among the movies few genuine pleasures. School for Scoundrels also boasts several gifted comic actors in bitty obnoxious roles that involve the wearing of sunglasses and the hurling of insults. Sarah Silverman who plays Barretts roommate appears periodically to deliver withering sarcasm. Before long its all over. Nice guys and creeps make it to the finish line though I wont say how they place.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Guys are guys in Todd Phillips movies for better or worse but almost always for the purposes of arriving somewhere in the same ZIP code as the truth. In ""Old School"" Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn used all their bluster and brew-enhanced bravado to prove ""mature"" men wanted the intimacy of family and the righteous buzz of a frat hangover at the same time. In ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" Phillips wrestled with the nerdy man-love of kitsch demonstrating how the boys can dress up like the mid-70s to make fun of it and celebrate it in the same gesture. With this weeks goofball guy comedy ""School for Scoundrels"" Phillips explores the insecurities of Everyman How aggressive must we be to succeed? Playing alpha male would be great sure. But remaining the beta dolphin-hugging male is a lot less tiring. Besides theres that ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" marathon on cable this weekend. We could just order a pizza and try to get the pretty girls phone number next week. Right? Because Phillips likes to explore modern man without the baggage of hating women or even worrying very much what women might be thinking the movies are terrific light entertainments. ""School for Scoundrels"" may not have the wild punches of ""Old School"" mostly because Ferrell and Vaughn are tough to match. But this remake of an old British novel and movie asks the ""guy"" question in the same funny thoughtful way. Jon Heder of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" plays pathetic Roger a Manhattan meter maid stuck in his dorky regulation uniform shorts ""through Dec. 1."" When he writes a parking ticket for a couple of wannabe gangsters they bust a cap in his official golf cart and ruin his year. When the third kid in a row dumps Roger as a Big Brother a friend gives him a phone number Call Dr. P hell teach you how to stand up for yourself. Enter the sleekest shark in the movie waters these days Billy Bob Thornton as the abusive and no doubt falsely credentialed leader of the School for Scoundrels. Dr. P promises to make each student a lean mean dating machine and mean is as Dr. P does. He ridicules the desire of one student to ""make 3000 more a year."" ""I got news for you Diego this class cost 5000 so youre already behind."" Billy Bob is the anti-""Hitch."" His advice in talking to women ""Lie lie and lie some more"" until ""you have something real to offer."" The second twist in ""Scoundrels"" is that Roger proves an adept student. Too quick to the alpha as it turns out - Dr. P has the nasty habit of competing with his best student each year in order to reprove his manhood and that means danger to Rogers budding relationship with sweet Amanda (Jacinda Barrett). As he did in the far crueler ""Bad Santa"" Thornton thrives as Chief Cad. Heders slack-mouthed surprise at his own good fortune serves the Roger character as well as it serves himself. The question is whether Roger has to beat the Bad Doctor on his own terms or invent a more honest way to compete. These are the Everyguy notes Phillips always manages to strike.

"Slow-paced School needs remedial work - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Slow-paced School needs remedial work By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 29 2006 The prostrate new comedy ``School for Scoundrels"" represents a waste of a perfectly good title. Directed and co-written by Todd Phillips (``Old School"" ``Starsky amp; Hutch"") its a remake of a 1960 British film about a sad sack who gets lessons in being a successful jerk and it achieves something previously thought impossible It renders Billy Bob Thornton unfunny.The main character Roger is played by Jon Heder -- Napoleon Dynamite himself -- making a noble stab at a romantic lead. Hair combed out in a woebegone pageboy jaw swinging slackly in the breeze Roger is a New York City meter man with big dreams and no spine. Hes regularly bullied into paying the tickets he writes out and hes tongue-tied in front of his neighbor a pretty Australian named Amanda (Jacinda Barrett of ``The Real World"" and ``The Last Kiss"") whose acid-tongued roommate (Sarah Silverman) immediately pegs him as a Dahmer-in-training.Clearly the boy needs help so a friend and former nerd (David Cross) sends Roger to Dr. P. (Thornton) the leader of a top-secret adult education class in how to discover ones inner stud. ``I used to be like you"" confides the friend ``and now Im dating two different Asian chicks"" Its all about the goals obviously.Aided by a sadistic drill sergeant named Lesher (Michael Clarke Duncan) Dr. P. whips his cowering students into shape with manly mantras ``Friends are just abstractions that stand between you and success""; ``A lion reaches out and takes what he wants""; ``Lie lie and lie some more.""In short order -- too short order -- Roger is the classs most promising pupil which causes the good doctors competitive afterburners to kick in. The back half of ``School for Scoundrels"" is a battle semi-royal between teacher and student with the clueless Amanda as the prize.Now a good ruthless tale of male aggression -- its uses and misuses -- has potential and if youve seen ``Bad Santa"" and ``Bad News Bears"" you know Thornton is the man you want leading the charge. Sadly the movie doesnt let him get out of first gear. The editing in ``School for Scoundrels"" has been keyed to tortoise Heder rather than jackrabbit Thornton and Dr. P.s impatient profanity-studded maxims hilarious as they are never build to combustive levels. Theres too much dead air and after a while you sense Thorntons attention wander to the movie hell be making after this one.Heder gives it a go and the films failure isnt really his fault. Hes too passive-aggressive for farce though and while Phillips fills the edges of the screen with known goofballs -- Ben Stiller as a former pupil Luis Guzman as Rogers boss Todd Louiso and Horatio Sanz as fellow students -- ``School for Scoundrels"" is in search of a core motor thats just not there.A nice half-twist toward the end almost saves it with the fake-outs between Roger and Dr. P. reaching amusingly nasty levels of gamesmanship. The problem is that what theyre fighting over isnt worth the energy Barretts Amanda is a dull sweetie utterly devoid of interest. ``School for Scoundrels"" goes against common sense and even its own title Why should Roger care about this limp noodle when he has Sarah Silverman in all her sadistic gorgeous glory right next door?Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"School for Scoundels | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; school-for-scoundels ) School for Scoundels (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli School for Scoundrels feels like a wasted opportunity. This is a case of a motion picture failing to unlock the promise of a ripe potential. As black comedies go this one is too tepid to hit any mark by which a movie is deemed successful. The darkness isnt the problem. If anything the movie isnt dark enough. Director Todd Phillips lacks the strength of conviction to take the production down a path that veers too far away from the mainstream crowd-pleasing road. Plus the one-upsmanship forming the backbone of the story isnt all that clever and the jokes lack punch. Taken in concert these things result in a forgettable motion picture. School for Scoundrels introduces us to Roger (Jon Heder) a guy whos so low in the self-esteem department that he doesnt even attain the level of ""loser."" Hes rejected as a Big Brother and while working at his job of handing out parking tickets he agrees to pay a fine to placate an irate driver. He has a crush on his next-door neighbor Amanda (Jacinda Barrett) but is too intimidated by being around her to muster the courage to ask her out on a date - and the presence of her sharp-tongued roommate (Sarah Silverman) makes things worse. Thats why when given the opportunity Roger elects to join a class that promises to remake his personality in the image of a lion. The class is run by Dr. P (Billy Bob Thornton) and his faithful sidekick Lescher (Michael Clarke Duncan). Dr. Ps methods include incessant verbal assaults and occasional physical pain. His lessons include valuable chestnuts like ""Never compliment a woman"" and ""Lie lie and lie some more."" For 5000 per student he attempts to replace meekness with callousness. His teachings give Roger the courage to ask out Amanda but then something unexpected happens. Dr. P takes an interest in her and Roger finds himself in a battle with the Master Bastard to win the heart of a woman. The gloves come off and things get dirtier than a political campaign. School for Scoundrels is loosely based on a 1960 Ealing comedy (which I have not seen) that was in turn based on the novel School for Scoundrels or How to Win without Actually Cheating by Stephen Potter. Phillips fresh off commercial success with Old School and Starsky and Hutch tries to mix the more sophisticated wit of the subject matter with the adolescent-friendly approach he used in his previous movies. The result is unpleasant and generates surprisingly few laughs. The spine of the movie is the one-upsmanship between Roger and Dr. P. Roger does something nasty to Dr. P (like humiliating him on a tennis court) and Dr. P responds (by staging a break-in and blaming it on Roger). This escalates until the stakes are life-and-death. The problem is theres not a lot of cleverness in this dual. For examples of this sort of thing done right consider the classic film Sleuth or the more recent French romantic comedy Love Me if You Dare. Both of those movies (and there are other titles as well) do interesting things with the premise; School for Scoundrels does not. Ever since Bad Santa Billy Bob Thornton has been typecast in this kind of role and theres a reason - he does it so well. School for Scoundrels is no exception. Jon Heder unfortunately is not well selected. He lacks the personality to hold the screen with Thornton. Thats okay when hes playing a loser but it hurts the movie during the scenes when Roger is supposed to have developed enough of a backbone to face off against Dr. P. And he and his female co-star Jacinda Barrett (who can also be seen in The Last Kiss) inhabit a void where no spark can be ignited. Black comedies are difficult to do well and the flaw evident in School for Scoundrels is a common reason they fail the movie is unwilling to turn really dark. It wants a happy ending. It wants to wallow in soot and ashes for a while but in the end the good guys and bad guys get whats coming to them. For the most part School for Scoundrels is a grim experience with too little wit and humor to compensate for its faults and the upbeat ending feels like a cheat. Thornton is good but not worth the price of a ticket.

Comments School for Scoundrels A wimpy parking cop (Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite) hoping to win the girl of his dreams (Jacinda Barrett) takes an assertiveness training course from a ruthless SOB (Billy Bob Thornton) but after he rises to the head of the class the teacher starts moving in on his girl. Director Todd Phillips has become Hollywoods go-to guy for collegiate humor and though this isnt as funny as his Road Trip Old School or Starsky amp; Hutch there are some choice sequences of the devious Thornton schooling his milquetoast students. The fine supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan Sarah Silverman David Cross Matt Walsh Todd Louiso Horatio Sanz Luis Guzman and (inevitably) Ben Stiller. PG-13 101 min. By J.R.

As it is hes trapped within his comfort zone in School for Scoundrels loosely adapted from a similarly named very British 1960 romp of twits starring Terry-Thomas and Ian Carmichael. Squaring off against Billy Bob Thornton whos in his comfort zone as a sharky scamming SOB Heder leads with his trademark toothy expression of clueless stupor as Roger a meek loser with a crush on Jacinda Barretts Amanda the pretty girl in the apartment next door. (Anyone cooler would prefer Amandas witheringly funny roommate played by Sarah Silverman.) For lessons in getting the ladies (as well as taking down lifes bullies) he takes an underground course from Thorntons shady ?Dr. P.? And the lessons work so well that Roger starts to score kicking in Dr. Ps own Bad News Bad Santa competitive side. The clash of comedic styles meanwhile dulls Thorntons edge (he cant be mean to such a nebbish and seem fair) while Heder in his first Hollywood leading role stalls Rogers energy level as if leery of changing lanes. Director Todd Phillips tries for the kind of frat slaphappiness he applied so successfully to Old School but these boys are less scoundrels than individual salesmen for the brands of Heder and Thornton.

Given its premise -- an adult school teacher attempting to remake wimpy men into fearsome macho studs -- pic seemed certain to either fly high on outrageous humor or crash under the weight of tastelessness leaving distrib MGM with weak fall earnings. Not even the mighty presence of Billy Bob Thornton can stir ""School for Scoundrels"" to life as a provocative comedy of manners or just plain comedy. Given its premise -- an adult school teacher attempting to remake wimpy men into fearsome macho studs -- pic seemed certain to either fly high on outrageous humor or crash under the weight of tastelessness. Instead the movie just sits there and never comes alive. Star Jon Heders ""Napoleon Dynamite"" fan club is likely to text-message the guys to stay away leaving distrib MGM with weak fall earnings. Anyone who knows the source material -- the 1959 Robert Hamer Ian Carmichael and Terry-Thomas comedy of the same title but with a kinder disposition -- is too gray to qualify for this films target aud so its strange an old pic should be the basis for a high-concept 2006 laffer aimed at young guys. Despite his hyphenate status director-producer-co-scribe Todd Phillips (""Old School"") does not appear to be engaged with the story and characters which may partly explain why Heder and Thorntons characters come off as so lackluster. Like its spineless males pic has lost its nerve to challenge aud assumptions of what it means to be a man -- presumably the whole point of the exercise. Parking meter cop Roger (Heder) is an open target for ridicule either from gangbangers stealing his cherished sneakers or co-workers harassing him. The latest is a group of kids who have rejected him as a Big Brother. A pile of self-help books at home (the movies opening obvious image) is no help at all. Clearly trying to snuggle up to cute Aussie neighbor Amanda (Jacinda Barrett) is out of the question. Taking advice from his Big Brother coordinator Ian (David Cross) Roger signs up for an adult ed class on confidence-boosting taught by Billy Bobs Dr. P with Michael Clarke Duncans Lesher as his intimidating bodyguard. Dr. P tells his class that theyre not even worthy of the status of ""loser"" since losers at least try and that in order to regain any sense of manhood they must find their inner lion. (References to the MGM Leo logo at the pics header are up to viewer interpretation.) Less a drill instructor than an unsmiling guy with preening arrogance Dr. P sends his students into the woods for a paintball game which includes Lesher having his way (off-screen in this ostensibly PG-13 comedy) with three lowly students -Eli (Todd Louiso) Diego (Horatio Sanz) and Walsh (Matt Walsh) -and Roger showing his first signs of manliness. Thinking hes won Dr. Ps favor Roger fails to grasp that hes now his mentors target P woos Amanda whom Roger is finally trying to date. In turn (and in one of pics bits that indirectly quote from the Brit original) Roger turns a tennis game into a chance to pummel P with some balls. Its war but because things are so languidly paced by Phillips and no truly funny set pieces emerge this is the comedy equivalent of low-grade combat. The further he gets away from his toothy/bushy-haired ""Napoleon Dynamite"" figure the less amusing Heder manages to be. But hes not alone. ""School"" assembles a knockout lineup of comic talent starting with comic genius Thornton and unfortunately does not provide them with funny material to work with. Only Ben Stiller who arrives late to the game as a former shell-shocked pupil of Dr. P has the opportunity to actually build an indelible character with an amusing core. Theres something to be grateful for at least in Christophe Becks score and its ironically amped-up use of military motifs while the rest of the production credits are merely standard-issue. Though set in New York pic jarringly inserts blatant Los Angeles locales including several in the nearby mountains.
