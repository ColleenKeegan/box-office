By Peter Rainer Film critic July 1 2016 Save for later Saved Ruby Barnhill (r.) and the Big Friendly Giant voiced by Mark Rylance appear in a scene from The BFG. Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Steven Spielbergs ""The BFG"" adapted by the late Melissa Mathison from the 1982 Roald Dahl novel harks back thematically if not favorably to ""E.T."" Its about Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) a spunky bespectacled 8-year-old orphan from central London who is plucked from her forbidding orphanage in the middle of the night by a 26-foot giant with a spindly neck sharp nose and floppy ears played by a special effects-enhanced Mark Rylance. (From some angles he resembles a sky-high Sean Penn.) Sophie had the misfortune of opening the curtains and spotting the skulking giant through her window and so fearing she will reveal his existence to humans he whisks her to his secret underground cave in a remote area inhabited by giants far less fond than he.The giant you see is as Sophie soon dubs him a BFG - big friendly giant. After a suitable interval in which she pleads to return to the orphanage it becomes clear she is happier with the BFG who at least cares for her and doesnt dole out punishments. Unlike the other giants nearby who have names like Meatdripper and Fleshlumpeater the BFG is not a carnivore. But the Neanderthal-looking yowlers who populate the barren terrain sense fresh meat and so Sophie with the flustery BFGs aid must periodically hide away on a moments notice. The BFG whose diction is a mash-up of quasi-nonsensical English that at times recalls Lewis Carrolls locutions - fizzy water for example is ""frobscottle"" - occupies his time collecting and storing dreams in glowing bottles in the recesses of his cave. These dreams are mostly blissful but they can be frightening too and it is Sophies brainstorm to combat the bad giants by instilling them with bad dreams with the assist as it turns out of no less than the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) and her military minions. (The time is the 1980s.) Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Dreamworks is the name of the studio Spielberg cofounded and clearly he sees himself as a kind of dreamcatcher. When his movies are really soaring as in ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" thats exactly what he is. For such a phenomenally savvy director he still seeks to retain a core of childlike wonder a sense of mission Movies are our ribbon of dreams and he wants us to dream our way to a better place. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Try as he might though Spielberg never sustains liftoff in ""The BFG."" This material is probably too typecast for him now; the childlike wonder seems processsed. With his extraordinary facility he can turn out a film like ""The BFG"" and at least superficially it seems like a classic. But true kidcentric classics - like ""E.T."" or Carroll Ballards ""The Black Stallion"" which was also written by Mathison - are not as doggedly one-note as this film. ""Classic"" should not be mistaken for monotonous and it was always Spielbergs great gift to infuse his fantasias with fun. ""The BFG"" is best not when we are held captive with Sophie and the BFG as he intones his ditties and speaks of ""the secret whisperings of the world."" Its best when Sophie in her finest schoolmarmish mode chides the BFG for ingesting a fizzy bottle of frobscottle and letting loose a whizzpopper. Obviously Spielberg does not see it the way I do. The comic scenes in ""The BFG"" which also include some very funny goings-on in Buckingham Palace are adroitly handled. (The BFG accidentally smashing an antique chandelier with his head introduces himself to the bemused Queen as ""your humbug servant."") But clearly his heart is with the dreamcatcher stuff. And for that to work it would have been better if a child with a more poetic force field than first-timer Barnhill had been cast. Barnhill does nothing conspicuously wrong but shes too dutiful a performer. In some ways she seems more artificially concocted than Rylances CGI BFG. Rylance gives a rueful rendition of the friendly giant. We can see how dashed he is by the sorrows of the world. The solitariness of his life is not easily dispelled not even by Sophie at her most Mary Poppins-ish. I think that Rylances brooding performance represents the ways in which Spielberg was hoping to deepen this fable. (In Dahls book the BFG is far more antic.) If there is not enough fun in ""The BFG"" its telling that there is also not enough fear. The cannibal giants are galumphing grotesques who are never shown (unlike in Dahl) eating any human ""beans."" The obverse of childhood wonderment is childhood cold sweats and Spielberg not wishing to roil the dreamweaver scenario keeps the upsets to a minimum. He doesnt want to ""cheapen"" the bliss. The result is that the wonderment with nothing serious at risk seems lackluster. There is more going on behind the curtain than this sweet but insubstantial fable allows for.

"BFG The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bfg-the ) BFG The (U.S./U.K. 2016) July 01 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli E.T. There Ive gotten it out of the way - the obligatory mention of the classic 1982 collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Melissa Mathison that every critic will make when reviewing The BFG. The truth is however that the two films have little in common beyond the concept of an atypical friendship between a human child and a fantastical creature. Contrasting The BFG to E.T. does the new film a disservice and its mediocre enough that it doesnt need the comparison to emphasize its shortcomings. In recent years Spielberg has become a hit-and-miss filmmaker and this is closer to a ""miss"" than a ""hit."" Part of the problem is undoubtedly the source material. Roald Dahls The BFG is not inherently cinematic. The structure of the story is such that its impossible to develop into a traditional three-act format. As a result the movie peaks around its midpoint and slides into anticlimax from there. The second hour isnt bad but it has a meandering quality. Theres an extended comedic sequence followed by a straightforward resolution that generates little in the way of excitement or interest. The film takes place in what must be a parallel universe. The opening scenes feel like excerpts from Dickens with orphanages and 19th-century-ish cobbled streets. Later we get walkie-talkies and modern-day helicopters. Our hero(ine) is a resident of the orphanage Sophie (Ruby Barnill) who looks out the window one night and is surprised to see a giant (Mark Rylance) whom she later names Big Friendly Giant (or BFG for short) wandering the streets. He spies her and fearful that she will tell people about him abducts her King Kong-style and carries her off to his home in the Land of the Giants. Lacking roots in her world she decides she wants to stay but there are problems. Most giants (with names like Bloodbottler and Fleshlumpeater) arent nice like BFG and they view girls like Sophie as tasty morsels. Sophie devises a plan to defeat the giants but it requires that the BFG present himself before the Queen (Penelope Wilton) - something he is profoundly unwilling to do. The story although lacking in excitement and immediacy (especially after the midpoint when the bad giants raid BFGs home) is never unengaging. But theres a bigger omission than that of a traditional structure the films emotional component is strangely muted. Returning to E.T. one of the reasons why that film worked (and its not alone among Spielberg films) is that we cared so much about the central relationship that when the ""happy ending"" forced the protagonists to sacrifice being with each other we as viewers were torn. The feelings generated by The BFG arent nearly as intense. Although we develop an attachment to Sophie and BFG and become invested in their friendship the connection is neither deep nor lasting and this limits the films power. Spielberg succeeds in crafting a land of strangeness and wonder but although his methods are flawless theyre not unique. Hailed for his groundbreaking use of CGI in Jurassic Park all those years ago he has been surpassed over the years by others who have pushed at the edges of the special effects envelope. The BFG does a good job making us believe in the title character and his world but the film doesnt have the awe-factor that accompanied Jurassic Park. The best things about The BFG are the lead performances. Plucky and immediately likable Ruby Barnhill is perfect as Sophie. This 11-year old British actress performance her feature debut (although she previously appeared the TV series ""4 OClock Club"") will put her on many critics ""people to watch"" list. Mark Rylance working for a second time with Spielberg after winning an Oscar under the directors guidance for Bridge of Spies conveys a gentle genial spirit with perhaps a hint of sadness. Its a surprisingly unexpectedly complex performance for a special effects-enhanced character. Although there are many things about The BFG that I admired and I laughed frequently during the dinner scene I found myself strangely unsatisfied by the experience. Perhaps as viewers we have unrealistic expectations from a director of this stature and expect greatness from everything he produces. The BFG is flawed and perhaps the problems are exacerbated because of the talent of the man behind the camera. This is pleasant passable summer entertainment but nothing more - and unlikely to excite the imagination (or the box office) in the way many of Spielbergs classics have.

If they were dazzled by the sheer scale of the world and the idea of a small child living alongside building-sized people then theyll likely enjoy Disneys visual extravaganza and forgive its barest semblance of a plot. But those who loved the vision of the Big Friendly Giant as a conjurer of dreams a plain-spoken alchemist who wanders the streets of London like an overgrown Sandman may find The BFG strangely lacking in wonder and feeling. Related Story Bridge of Spies Is Spielberg in Minor Key On paper The BFG seems like an obvious win for Spielberg. The film marked his reunion with the writer Melissa Mathison who scripted his masterful childrens fable E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (though she sadly died last year). Its also the first big-screen version of Dahls beloved book and takes full advantage of all the fancy technology required to render the eponymous giant in all his big friendly glory. But for all its awe-inspiring spectacle The BFG is a childrens fable thats more likely than not to bore kids to sleep with its truly languorous two-hour run time. It only really gathers momentum in its wonderful final act by which point its target audience may have lost the thread.But first the good The highlight of The BFG is easily its star--Mark Rylance Spielbergs newest muse who gave a performance of tragic simplicity and economy in the 2015 spy drama Bridge of Spies and collected an Oscar for it. There Rylance played a Soviet agent who had long ago sublimated whatever passion he had for his cause observing a colossal diplomatic crisis with the passivity of an office drone. Here his BFG exudes explosive joy rambling Dahls gleeful nonsense dialogue as he furrows and knits his CGI brow.But the BFG has the same workmanlike hardscrabble charm as Rudolf Abel of Bridge of Spies and Rylance has again brought something transformational to a Spielberg film. He gives the kind of performance you cant look away from even with all the big-budget delights that abound. Every strange and garbled line and even his incomprehensible mumbling as he shambles around his dream-cave chopping up giant yellow cucumbers is engrossing. Rylance is highly gifted at the specific challenge of motion-capture acting contorting his face into all kinds of silly shapes and sizes with remarkable grace.The plot is where the film takes a step down. The BFG pretty faithfully follows the structure of Dahls book--Sophie a plucky orphan played by newcomer Ruby Barnhill is yanked from her bed by the giant after spotting him wandering the streets at night. He takes her back to Giant Country where hes revealed to be a mild-mannered runt living among a group of dunderheaded man-eating titans (performed by Jermaine Clement and Bill Hader among others). Sophies initial suspicion is quickly put aside and she becomes a valuable assistant to the BFG whose job consists of creating dreams in an underground lab and blowing them into the ears of sleeping people.If you guessed that this doesnt sound like enough story to fill a two-hour film youd be right Spielberg spends much of the running time marveling at the world hes created with Sophie a frustrated little bean running around the BFGs oversized home. There are some mild dust-ups with the BFGs brother giants larger-bodied but lesser-brained bullies who rely on him for medical attention and sleep aids. Theres also the funny business of dream-catching which sees the BFG and Sophie running around a big glowing tree dropping terms like ""phizzwizzard"" and ""trogglehumper"" with casual aplomb.Scattered throughout the film are sequences of genuine splendor. The BFG clad in his cape leaping across the landscape of Britain to go to Giant Country is reminiscent of the absolute best moments of Spielbergs visual storytelling. Sophie cowering in the BFGs gargantuan kitchen is worthy piece of big-budget showing-off. But theres not the kind of grand emotional arc that made Spielbergs best kids films like E.T. or Empire of the Sun so memorable. Sophie starts out willful and remains so the entire time and while the BFG has to overcome some doubts about publicly mixing with humanity he does so eventually without much fuss. The idea of dream-conjuring is reduced to a few images of dancing CGI shadows being mixed into a bottle; given the otherwise marvelous-looking world Spielberg has created these scenes feel disappointingly flat.The film does however build to an incredible climax straight out of Dahls book--one involving the very sensible Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) her loyal staff (including Rafe Spall and Rebecca Hall) a small posse of corgis and an incredible amount of fart humor deployed with as much subtlety as Spielberg can muster. After 100 minutes of snooze-invoking meandering in Giant Country its the kind of singular spectacle that can charm audiences young and old. Theres just not enough of it to make The BFG anything more than a mid-tier childrens fable a quickly forgettable confection that falls well short of the directors greatest efforts.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Which is to say its part childlike wonder part precious gibberish.Like Martin Scorseses ""Hugo"" its a kids movie by a guy who hasnt been a kid in 60 years and doesnt seem all that interested in what todays kids are into. Its like when a grandparent plans a day for the young ones based on whats good for them rather than what theyll actually like. Its wishful thinking on a giant-sized scale.Whether kids will buy into this refined tale of a peaceful British giant who catches childrens dreams and is eventually granted an audience with the Queen of England is one of summers biggest gambles. There are several flatulence jokes and kids like those. The rest is a roll of the dice.The film does feature a pair of gee-whiz sequences starting with the opening where a young orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) meets the BFG (Oscar winner Mark Rylance) late at night when she cant sleep. The BFG -- for the Dahl-deprived that stands for Big Friendly Giant -- moves about the streets in silence hiding in the shadows and posing as a streetlight or a tree in a dazzling set-piece that captures the wonder of Spielbergs creation and looks like a storybook come to life.The BFG is a CGI being based on Rylances features and the actors welcoming eyes and kind voice lend the giant a spectacular warmth. Late in the film when he gets to meet the Queen in an extended sequence that doesnt necessarily fit with the rest of the movie the movie finally takes full advantage of the giant his massive scale (he uses a pitchfork to eat pancakes) and the playfulness at the films disposal.Elsewhere the film gets bogged down in Dahl-speak -- its too twee by half -- and loses its way in its flabby center.Much of the story is spent in the land of giants where the BFG must fend off his peers who eat children like theyre jelly beans. The problem is theyre just not all that interesting despite having names like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement). Sophie is forced to hide out in the BFGs lair while the other giants sniff around for her and Spielberg whirls the camera around in a series of close calls that never really feel suspenseful.And theres all sorts of business with dreams as the BFG uses a large horn-like device to blow dreams into childrens heads. He also captures nightmares and concocts a plan to implant them into the other giants heads -- are you still following? Its complicated and worse dull.Spielberg directing his first kids movie since 2011s ""The Adventures of Tintin"" treats ""The BFG"" like high tea which is welcome at a time when everything else is burgers and french fries.As a character the BFG is a wondrous creation and Rylance does a magnificent job bringing him to life. But the film only occasionally reaches its potential and otherwise feels like a missed chance at giant fun.

Thats what happens to Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill) a bespectacled little girl wrapped in her quilt and snatched from a London orphanage at the beginning of Steven Spielbergs supersized dream of a movie The BFG. Those letters stand for Big Friendly Giant a character and book concocted by the devilish storyteller Roald Dahl. In Spielbergs grasp - mixing live-action and green screen CG and motion-capture effects - the 1982 childrens story becomes a large-scale tableau of impossibly wonderful images the giant (played by Mark Rylance with Dumbo ears and a sweet befuddled frown) skulking down London side streets cloaking himself in the shadows; the giant (holding Sophie) taking (yes) giant leaps across the Thames alongside rows of trees and coastal cliffs over mountains and moors on the way to his home. Like E.T. that other Spielberg yarn The BFG is the tale of a child who befriends a scary and misunderstood creature from a different land. Each learns from the other working out issues of fear and loneliness coming together to battle malevolent forces. In E.T. the bad guys were ominous G-men. In The BGF theyre a different kind of G-men giants far taller and mightier than the one they call ""Runt."" They sense their neighbor the BFG is harboring a human. They can smell her and they want to eat her. Like the best childrens stories The BFG has a dreamlike quality in no small part because its towering title character concocts dreams - thats what he does. There are jars labeled with dreamers names all over his stone and wood abode each with a nocturnal reverie swirling inside. The BFG uses a long trumpetlike apparatus to send the dreams their respective ways. If this all sounds magical and splendiferous it is up to the point when the film - like the Dahl book - does a wacky 180 landing in Buckingham Palace of all places. There the Queen (Penelope Wilton) and her staff (Rebecca Hall Rafe Spall) must figure out how to accommodate a terribly large and unexpected guest. Theres also a third-act military operation - the generals of the British Army ordering squads of helicopters and soldiers to the land where the really big mean creatures live. So theres that silliness. There are also several distracting scenes where little Sophie and her 24-foot-tall pal are talking to each other bonding but the actors eyes are fixed on some imaginary point in the middle distance where a ping-pong ball on a stick (or something like that) is too obviously subbing for the other pal. And tell me if Im nuts but another distraction Doesnt the BFG bear a striking resemblance to George W. Bush? Make his ears flappier give him a more dramatic recession (hairline that is not economic) and a jawline wisp of beard and GWB and BFG could be twins. Thats Rylance in the BFGs eyes for sure and in the voice but its not hard to imagine ""43"" striding around the White House at 3 a.m. causing a great rumpledumpus as BFG would say. But hey even if the Queen makes a passing reference to ""Nancy and Ronnie"" (time-framing a movie that otherwise looks like its set in 1960s London) politics - American British otherwise - is not what The BFG is about. Its about coming to terms with the Bogeyman. And coming to like him very much.sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629 Steven_Rea Movie review The BFG (Out of four stars) y Directed by Steven Spielberg.

Director Steven SpielbergRated PG for action/peril some scary moments and brief rude humorLength 117 minutes 41 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORETheres a secret about children that Steven Spielberg Melissa Mathison and Roald Dahl have always known -- that no matter how innocent kids are as capable of understanding darkness as adults and sometimes even more so. Its not that its some completely unacknowledged truth but it is one that rarely seems to permeate what we consider ""childrens entertainment"" in any real way. It just makes adults too uncomfortable. Its also the reason why the under-10 set flocks to Dahl.A measured embrace of the deep menace in Dahls words is why this long-time-coming adaptation of his 1982 book ""The BFG "" not only succeeds but shines. Its not just some pleasant romp into the world of giants. Its an honest-to-goodness gut punch of a journey crackling with heart uncertainty and overflowing with all-out wonder.Theres really no other way to tell a story about an orphan who is captured by a giant and taken to a land crawling with much larger giants who like the taste of human beings or ""beens"" as theyre called.MORE Find more movie reviews of films now in local theaters or coming to theaters this weekend.The orphan Sophie is played by the newcomer Ruby Barnhill. Sporting a Dorothy Hamill haircut and rounded glasses this little brunette moppet is a delightful revelation who is at turns feisty lovable and even a little annoying (in a good way). In other words shes a believable kid -- a result that Spielberg has been coaxing out of child actors since ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.""Thankfully Sophie has been taken not by man-eaters but the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance who was just in Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies"") who prefers to create dreams for the children of England not snack on them. But Sophie who lays awake night after night saw him gliding through the streets of London and she cant be trusted with the knowledge that giants really do exist no matter how pure her intentions.STATESMAN JOURNALReview Finding Dory no trophy fish but its a keeperThis image released by Disney shows Ruby Barnhill and the Big Friendly Giant from Giant Country voiced by Mark Rylance in a scene from""The BFG."" (Disney via AP) (Photo AP)Back in Giant Country things dont get off to a great start between Sophie and the BFG either. It takes some trials some scary dreams some danger and some skepticism before their friendship becomes real -- but its worth the build.Whether youve read ""The BFG"" a thousand times or havent in 30 years or even at all Sophie and The BFGs impossible bond is bound to break your heart.Rylances BFG is an astonishing meld of real life and CG animation. Its jarring at first but kids wont mind and adults will grow accustomed to it. Thankfully it somehow stays clear of the uncanny valley. Most importantly it fits in the context and look of this storybook world which truly does feel like the page come to life.STATESMAN JOURNALCatch a movie under the stars this summerThere are certain limitations to the form that hinder the full range of a Rylance performance but whats here is sufficient even when hes flatulent -- sorry whizzpopping -- or working his way through Dahls twisty language.The only real misstep is when the humans are introduced. Sophie has had enough with the bullying of the other giants and decides as in the book to go convince the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) and her assistants (Rebecca Hall Rafe Spall) to help save the children of England from certain death by giant.The pacing of this segment goes haywire and feels like too long and meandering a diversion in what is already a long movie. Not to mention the fact that a significant portion of this sequence is devoted to whizzpoppers. It just makes you long to return to Giant Country the BFGs gadget-filled home and the land of dreams.Theres a melancholy hanging over the film too -- that its Mathisons final screenwriting credit. Its also a lovely exit for a woman who always knew to never write down to her audience children or not. Mathison died last November of cancer at age 65.STATESMAN JOURNALCheap summer movies for kids families come to theatersThe BFG1/2Stars Mark Rylance Ruby Barnhill Penelope Wilton Jemaine Clement Rebecca HallDirector Steven SpielbergRated PG for action/peril some scary moments and brief rude humorLength 117 minutesWhereFandango.com 41 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

"Steven Spielbergs The BFG seeks to recapture the heights of E.T. - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Steven Spielbergs The BFG seeks to recapture the heights of E.T. ""The BFG"" Walt Disney Studios Ruby Barnhill and a digitally rendered Mark Rylance in the movie ""The BFG."" Ruby Barnhill and a digitally rendered Mark Rylance in the movie ""The BFG."" (Walt Disney Studios) Justin Chang ""I had a dream last night."" The words arrive near the end of ""The BFG"" and while they are thankfully not to be mistaken for that oldest of story-upending cliches (""It was all a dream"") they nonetheless linger like a melancholy echo over the whimsical high spirits of Steven Spielbergs new movie. In ways both obvious and elusive the curious logic of dreams is crucial to appreciating this technologically astounding if predictably sweetened adaptation of Roald Dahls 1982 novel.As millions of readers already know ""The BFG"" is shorthand for ""the Big Friendly Giant"" played via a brilliant amalgam of performance-capture technology and peerless screen presence by Mark Rylance. At once a protector of the weak and a principled herbivore (he subsists on slimy nasty vegetables called snozzcumbers) he is also the practitioner of a most unusual artisanal hobby the collection and dissemination of dreams. The BFG is basically the Sandman on steroids but he is also a stand-in for Spielberg a purveyor of big-screen enchantment who has done more than perhaps any other filmmaker to shape the dream life of audiences the world over. At no point in his career has the director managed this quite so effortlessly as with ""E.T."" a movie that casts a long and inescapable shadow over this one. Released the same year Dahls book was published ""E.T."" also centered around a gnomic being with benign powers funny speech patterns an easy rapport with children and a memorable acronym for a nickname. (Both films are the work of the screenwriter Melissa Mathison who died last year.) The BFG trailer Watch the trailer for ""The BFG."" Watch the trailer for ""The BFG."" See more videos With ""The BFG"" Spielberg has taken a break from the serious-minded sweep of his recent political procedurals (""Bridge of Spies"" ""Lincoln"") and attempted to fashion a new classic of childhood wonderment. In this he has been only partially successful. Dragged along by the insistent churnings of John Williams score the movie is noisy and emphatic at times when a quieter moodier touch would suffice and it contains at least one antic sequence involving a homemade water flume that could be a prototype for an attraction coming soon to a Disney theme park near you. But despite the compromises that typically attend a studio-made family entertainment -- especially one that has been adapted however lovingly from a sharper edgier piece of source material -- ""The BFG"" also possesses a rich and unmistakably Spielbergian understanding of the loneliness of childhood and of the enduring consolations that friendship and imagination can offer. Not unlike its title character the movie can be cloddish and clumsy but it is also a thing of wily cleverness and lithe surprising grace.The movie opens on a haunted nocturnal vision of London the camera (wielded by Spielbergs usual cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) settling on an orphanage bathed in the warm glow of streetlamps and perfectly placed shafts of moonlight. Its a suitably eerie look for what Sophie (plucky newcomer Ruby Barnhill) describes with a sometimes wearying gift for overstatement as ""the witching hour"" -- the same hour that she spies the BFG lurking in the street outside her window. He spies her too and within moments shes caught in his very large grip racing northward through the English countryside to Giant Country.What follows is perhaps the most kid-friendly chronicle of Stockholm syndrome this side of ""Beauty and the Beast"" though adults may find themselves submitting no less readily to the warmth and wit of Rylances performance. The BFG has scraggly gray hair comically oversized ears and a gentle scrape of a voice as inimitable as one of the actors fingerprints -- and its that voice more than anything that gives this digital avatar his soul. Coming off his supremely restrained Oscar-winning turn as a Soviet spy in ""Bridge of Spies"" Rylance goes in the opposite direction here; unlike Rudolf Abel his BFG is a man of many words. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story And what marvelously mangled words they are. Mathison and Rylance have more than honored the BFGs unorthodox yet utterly intuitive way with the English language particularly his affection for the present participle and his blithe disregard for subject-verb agreement. ""Words is oh such a twitch-tickling problem all me life"" he moans at one point though few who hear him will be inclined to agree. Long before she settles down in the giants cavernous home (marvelously conceived by production designer Rick Carter) Sophie realizes that her captor has no intention of harming her let alone eating her or any other ""human beans."" The same cannot be said of his nine bare-chested brothers who dwell in the hills nearby and whose fearsome appetites are aptly summed up by their names Fleshlumpeater Childchewer Bloodbottler et al. (They are played most of them unrecognizably by actors including Jemaine Clement Jonathan Holmes and Bill Hader.)Dahls justly beloved childrens novels (including the previously filmed ""James and the Giant Peach"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" ""Matilda"" and ""The Witches"") are distinguished by their narrative ingenuity and their surpassingly wicked humor -- a bracing reminder that children long to be thrilled and even frightened by what they read not infantilized. In ""The BFG"" Dahl took a particularly nasty delight in describing every ghastly detail of the giants dietary habits laced with riotously crude wordplay. (Sample dialogue ""Greeks from Greece is all tasting greasy."") Absent that mordantly funny sensibility Spielbergs PG-rated interpretation cant help but feel sanitized by comparison. His giants Cro-Magnon cannibals though they may be are played less for bloodthirsty menace than for buffoonish comedy setting the stage for a few rambunctious but perfunctory action sequences. Every Steven Spielberg movie ranked from first to worst Marc Bernardin Alfred Hitchcock after seeing ""Jaws"" said that young Steven Spielberg ""is the first one of us who doesnt see the proscenium arch."" By which to say that free of the theatrical conventions that informed every other filmmaker before him Spielberg was the first truly modern director. Since then... Alfred Hitchcock after seeing ""Jaws"" said that young Steven Spielberg ""is the first one of us who doesnt see the proscenium arch."" By which to say that free of the theatrical conventions that informed every other filmmaker before him Spielberg was the first truly modern director. Since then... (Marc Bernardin) Curiously uninvested in its own narrative conflict ""The BFG"" is best appreciated as a drolly funny celebration of difference. Its no surprise that the picture springs to life when Sophie seeks an audience with the queen (a shrewdly cast Penelope Wilton) in an extended sequence that throws the BFGs physical enormity into high comic relief. It also serves as a clever sendup of English formality full of stiff upper lips and splendidly egalitarian fart jokes.Theres no way that Spielberg and his collaborators could have guessed that a silly story of cross-cultural friendship -- in which a well-oiled British government acknowledges the humanity of a dangerous-looking outsider -- would feel like an ever more resonant fantasy in the post-Brexit era. ""The BFG"" is a far-from-perfect movie that may have arrived at the perfect moment. Like so many good dreams it leaves us groping for a past that can never be recovered but also looking ahead to a future that suddenly seems brighter and friendlier than we had dared to believe. -------------The BFGMPAA rating PG for action/peril some scary moments and brief rude humorRunning time 1 hour 57 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Steven Spielberg PG Rated Movies Lincoln (movie 2012) Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-the-bfg-review-20160627-snap-story.html#nt=oft03a-1la1,200,thebfg7,thebfg,latimes

Both artists often tell stories about misunderstood children finding connections with misunderstood fantastical alien creatures. They have a knack for drawing out the dark and maudlin aspects of childhood the loneliness and isolation as well as the capacity for wonder and amazement the sheer possibility of anything and everything. That dreamy wonderment is the best part of the filmed ""The BFG"" a slow haze that creeps over you unsuspected. The film is a faithful translation of Dahls book with screenwriter Melissa Mathison ably bringing Dahls nonsensical language of the Big Friendly Giant to cinematic life. Mark Rylance who won an Oscar for his portrayal of a Soviet spy in Spielbergs 2015 film ""Bridge of Spies"" wonderfully inhabits the CGI character of the BFG a gentle giant the runt of his pack who spends his time catching dreams and blowing them into bedrooms at night. His hillbilly British accent and creative ""squiggled"" word combinations spin you up into Dahls inimitable style honed by Mathison.Opposite Rylance is the precocious Ruby Barnhill as Sophie the orphan who spies him from her window at night and whom he spirits away to Giant Country to keep his secret. The lonely imaginative and smart Sophie finds an adventure in the BFG a friend a protector and in Sophie the BFG has something outside of his own curious existence to live for. Theirs is a specific kind of friendship finite contained from the outset. One does wish that it wasnt shot so much with the affectionate gaze of a traditional romance story though. Sophie sparks a great ""rumpledumpus"" in Giant Country. Her presence is quickly sniffed out by a rugby team of massive giants with names like Fleshlumpeater and Bloodbottler slumbering under sod blankets outside the BFGs stone door hungry for human beings. Under attack she urges her new friend to stand up to the bullies and even escorts him right to The Queens palace for a chat about giant-human diplomacy. Theres a sweet magic in the films style particularly in the twinkling aurora borealis firefly light of BFGs dream workshop where he collects and labels the dreams that he disperses. But theres also a softness to the dramatic arc of the film which doesnt so much march forward as it wafts along with rather low stakes and all-too-easy resolutions. There are a few physical comedy bits that go on too long and explosive green fart humor that does happen to be native to the original text. The third act that departs Giant Country for Buckingham Palace is probably the funniest but the fish-out-of-water routine goes for broad easy laughs and abruptly severs the sense of ethereal incredulity within the world of the giants. Barnhills performance starts to feel affected. While Penelope Wilton Rebecca Hall and Rafe Spall are nevertheless charming as The Queen and her entourage it doesnt feel of a piece with the rest of the film. The most effective moments of ""The BFG"" are the ones that hit home with wistful emotion but surprise with the possibilities of magic in connections -- those moments that Spielberg and Dahl have defined for a generation.

Doane Gregory/DreamWorks II Distribution Co. In an age when computer-generated imagery can make anything possible effects are expensive and miracles are cheap. So it should be said as emphatically as possible that the ""big friendly giant"" in The BFG Steven Spielbergs ingratiating adaptation of Roald Dahls childrens book is a spectacular creation. Voiced by Mark Rylance who won an Oscar last year for Spielbergs Bridge of Spies the BFG interacts seamlessly with its non-digital counterparts and projects a warmth and tremulous humanity that keeps it out of the uncanny valley. Heres a story about bridging the gap between a plucky orphan and a fantastical giant and part of that bridge is technical If we dont believe they exist in the same space or if their connection doesnt register on the giants face then the film doesnt work. Much like his animated bauble from a few years ago The Adventures of Tintin The BFG feels like a low-stakes experiment for Spielberg a direct appeal to children through the cutting-edge tools of the day. Dusting off an old script by the late Melissa Mathison whose work on The Black Stallion and his E.T. has a Zen-like storybook economy Spielberg brightens the darker corners of Dahls book and accentuates its sweetness and charm. He delights in its dopey malapropisms its jars of fairy-light dreams and the green rocket-blast farts that the BFG calls ""whizpopping."" Theres the tiniest sliver of melancholy in these two lonely picked-on characters forging an unlikely friendship but a spirit of slap-happy adventure dominates. Representing a throwback to an earlier broader period of Disney live-action movies Ruby Barnhill plays the orphan Sophie like Wendy Darling in Peter Pan -- precocious and headstrong with plenty of mobility in a floor-length pajama gown. Given to wandering the orphanage after hours Sophie happens to catch the BFG sneaking around London with a trumpet-like object which he uses to blow bottled dreams into childrens heads as they sleep. In an effort to contain his secret the BFG snatches Sophie and takes her back to his humble abode in Giant Country where he happens to be the lovable runt of much larger and much nastier species. Other giants like The Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) and The Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) are man-eating bullies; the BFG subsists on a disgusting green vegetable called the ""snozzcumber."" The silliness extends all the way to Buckingham Palace where Sophie and the BFG appeal to no less than the Queen (Penelope Wilson) herself to put a stop to man-eating giants. This leads to the films most delightful setpiece which has the Queens guards and servants giving the two a royal welcome complete with a whizpopping brunch that alights the palace in green gas and giddy embarrassment. Its slapstick comedy and princess fantasy rolled into one--Sophie scooping great spoonfuls of strawberries-and-cream with the Queen the BFG breaking up the room with his all-too-earthy mix of awkward gentility and explosive flatulence. Dahl isnt above a little low humor and neither is Spielberg. Far too long at 117 minutes The BFG finds Spielberg pressing too hard for wonderment at times particularly when hes dealing with the giants passion for catching and concocting dreams like fireflies in primary color. With John Williams score ladling on the sentiment like glaze on a Christmas ham the film loses some of the deftness necessary for a story this slight. With so few twists and turns in the narrative -- orphan meets giant orphan befriends giant orphan and giant appeal to the Queen to fight mean giants -- theres nothing gained in gumming up the works. Yet simplicity reigns supreme starting with Rylances beautiful performance as the giant and the artistry of the effects technicians who animated it. The BFGs floppy ears alone recall Dumbo in their expressive twitches which alternately wriggle like a bunnys nose or curl back attentively. For a little girl with no family or friends hes a sympathetic listener and her enthusiasm and mischievousness coaxes him out of isolation too. The biggest emotional moments in The BFG combine Rylances working-class humility and decency with subtle wrinkles in the animation that suggest a stirring of the soul. Its the rare CGI wonder that moves as well as awes.

You may share in the delight of the big fellow himself who regards a good fart as an expression of well-being. You may laugh at the bilious green gass propulsive force. Or you may turn up your cinematically offended nose. But at least youll feel something which is more than can be said for most of the rest of the film which finds Spielberg indulging his taste for effects both garish and goopy while neglecting the emotional connection between orphan (a somewhat wooden Ruby Barnhill) and giant (a sweet CGId Mark Rylance). Neglecting also the palpable dread and danger that should infuse a story involving the eating of children. Indulging also the giants mistakifined vocabunaries -- which probably worked better on the page -- and the runtime in general. There are good bits among the bad (the giants bullying bratty kinfolk especially) but mostly theres simply not enough there. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona Showtimes AMC Mission Valley 1640 Camino del Rio North San Diego 888-262-4386 | Directions Saturday July 30 235pm 525pm Sunday July 31 220pm 505pm Monday August 1 245pm 530pm Tuesday August 2 245pm 530pm Wednesday August 3 245pm Angelika Film Center 11620 Carmel Mountain Road San Diego 858-674-6164 | Directions Sunday July 31 1240pm Monday August 1 1240pm Tuesday August 2 1240pm Wednesday August 3 1240pm Thursday August 4 1240pm ArcLight La Jolla 4425 La Jolla Village Drive Suite H60 San Diego 858-768-7770 | Directions Saturday July 30 240pm Sunday July 31 240pm Monday August 1 240pm Tuesday August 2 240pm Wednesday August 3 240pm Digiplex Temecula Tower Cinemas 27531 Ynez Road Temecula CA 951-699-4970 | Directions Saturday July 30 155pm 445pm 735pm 1025pm Sunday July 31 1105am 155pm 445pm 735pm 1025pm Monday August 1 1105am 155pm 445pm 735pm 1025pm Tuesday August 2 1105am 155pm 445pm 735pm 1025pm Wednesday August 3 1105am 155pm 445pm 735pm 1025pm Regal Oceanside 401 Mission Avenue Oceanside 760-439-1327 | Directions Saturday July 30 410pm Sunday July 31 1240pm 410pm Monday August 1 1240pm 410pm Tuesday August 2 1240pm 410pm Wednesday August 3 1240pm 410pm Thursday August 4 1240pm 325pm Regal San Marcos 1180 W.

Roald Dahls tale of the friendship between a little orphan girl and a good-natured goliath comes to the screen as a 3D mix of live action and performance capture. Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a child living in a London orphanage. One night while all the other children are sleeping she sees a huge and mysterious person in the streets. To her horror that giant person (Mark Rylance) picks her up and carries her off to Giant Country. However its quickly made clear that Sophie has been snatched up by a friendly giant; he explains that while he eats a strange vegetable called snozzcumbers the other giants eat people and mostly children at that. Sophie is in danger then from a pack of marauding giants but the Big Friendly Giant though shorter than the others is there to protect her. There are cliffhanger moments during which she must run and hide (and in clever places) from the bad giants but its all quite mild-mannered. Later theres a scarier and more boisterous scene when Sophie is in the middle of a game of giants playing with trucks but theres not much in The BFG that would frighten anyone over the age of about five. Meanwhile Sophie and the friendly giant bond over his employment which is capturing dreams and floating them into peoples sleep. (The sequence in which the giant demonstrates dream catching to Sophie is utterly charming visually.) They become friends. The giant shows Sophie a green bubbly drink that creates spectacular farts or whizzpoppers. On her side Sophie counsels her giant not to let the bigger mean giants bully him. But after the bad giants wreak havoc at the BFGs house she decides to take action. Sophie goes to the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) to get help with the giant problem. First she gets the Queen and her staff to accept The BFG as she has which leads to some endearing scenes of the giant eating breakfast in royal company. He gobbles masses of toast and eggs while seated on the Queens grand piano the only thing big enough to hold him. Later the Queens armed forces take care of the wicked giants. Thats unfortunate on a few levels but above all because those villains are the most energetic things in the film. The BFG is mild-mannered to the point of snoredom. While its a nice change to see kiddie entertainment that isnt wound up and frantic this film is too much in the other direction. And its far too long. The 3D element seems to darken and dampen the picture adding nothing; all that technical wizardry notwithstanding the movie seems clunky -- the marriage between live action and digital magic is a rocky one. The BFG has great credentials. Its directed by Steven Spielberg and the screenplay is by the late Melissa Mathison who wrote E.T. Youd be forgiven for expecting it to be far more interesting than it is.

The BFG Spielberg does Roald Dahl in this take on the authors novel about a girl and BFF giant Ruby Barnhill and a motion-captured Mark Rylance in Steven Spielbergs The BFG. By Peter Travers June 28 2016 More News Watch Fantastical Trailer for Steven Spielbergs The BFG 11 Best Movies of 2016 So Far Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones All Stories >> Even Steven Spielberg feels pressure sometimes. On The BFG the famed director must serve two masters Roald Dahls beloved 1982 novel about a little girl who gets kidnapped by a BFG (big friendly giant) her savior in a land of unfriendly cannibal giants; and a liberties-taking script by Melissa Mathison who wrote Spielbergs 1982 blockbuster E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and died last year of neuroendocrine cancer. Then theres the matter of turning The BFG into a movie that can stand on its own. More News Watch Fantastical Trailer for Steven Spielbergs The BFG 11 Best Movies of 2016 So Far Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones All Stories >> Related Steven Spielbergs Movies Ranked Worst to Best From Saving Private Ryan to Raiders the King of Hollywoods work from completists-only to modern classics For special effects alone theres no problem Theyre spectacular. And theres no faulting Mark Rylance a newly-minted Oscar winner for Spielbergs Bridge of Spies whose motion-capture performance as a 24-foot giant is both subtly nuanced and truly monumental. In a role once intended for the late Robin Williams the British Rylance is transformed by technology while still looking very much like himself. One scene set in London by night shows how the giant manages to cloak his humongous presence by blending in with the scenery. And what a thing of beauty terror and rare delicacy it is. Things get ""a bit grumbly"" -- to borrow a BFG phrase -- when the worlds of Spielberg and Dahl collide. Were set for terror in giant country where the big guy takes 10-year-old Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill) after he sweeps her out of her orphanage bed in London. The BFG looks like the runt of the litter and he is mercilessly bullied by these huge beasts with such names as Bloodbottler (voiced by Bill Hader) who are eager to chow down on little Sophie. One of these jumbo titans Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) is an expert at sniffing out  ""human beans."" This is the darkest of Dahl but Spielberg favors watching the BFG collect dreams in glass jars and blow them into the heads of sleeping humans. Its a reasonable metaphor for Spielbergs own method. The biggest laughs come at Buckingham Palace where Sophie convinces the Queen (Penelope Wilton) and her retinue to enjoy the BFGs favorite drink a ""frobscottle"" which sets off an explosion of  ""whizzpoppers"" -- farts that rival of explosion of flatulence in Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles. But during a climactic helicopter roundup of evil giants you want the movie to go for broke and start provoking something more than easy laughter and tears. E.T. did that brilliantly and so did Close Encounters of the Third Kind -- family films that could keep mom and dad up nights along with the kids. Regrettably The BFG plays it too nice and falls short. Topics Steven Spielberg Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Photo Walt Disney Co./Everett Collection By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 1 2016 444 p.m. ET 8 COMMENTS In ""The BFG"" Steven Spielbergs version of the beloved Roald Dahl childrens book the Big Friendly Giant of the title uses a trumpet to blow dreams of the hearts desire into sleepers heads. Mr. Spielberg uses digital wizardry to throw dreams of friendship and adventure on the big screen and what marvelous dreams they are--funny grotesque and tender as well as spectacular. The film which was adapted by Melissa Mathison can be leisurely bordering on laggardly but it gains dramatic stature from one of the great actors of our time Mark Rylance filling the title role. His face and body are transformed by technology of course but magically so; the giant seems as human in his bizarre way as Sophie ( Ruby Barnhill) the small spunky girl--the SSG--who learns to love him after he reaches through a window at night and plucks her from her orphanage dormitory bed and all. More Reviews Tarzan Read More Mark Rylance on Shakespeare Spielberg and CGI (June 29 2016) In The BFG a Word Big Enough for a Roald Dahl Giant (June 10 2016) A Spielberg movie framed as family entertainment raises the question of whether its up to the several classics especially ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" that Mr. Spielberg has contributed to the genre. No this one isnt but it wasnt meant to be; its dramatic scope as distinct from its physical scale is relatively modest. A big part of the books appeal is the giants warped delightfully inventive language--""a catasterous disastrophe"" and such. Theres a sense that the filmmaker saw an opportunity for inventions in his own visual language and he gives us one stunning image after another postwar London in the fog; Giant Country an off-the-maps territory where the BFG lives; Dream Country where he collects the dreams that he later bestows; his sprawling workshop where he stores pastel-colored dreams in countless glass jars; his unnatural enemies a gaggle of far more gigantic giants who unlike him eat children--the movies softening of the book spares us that spectacle--and who make the poor BFGs life a comical hell. Brilliant images dont always equate with breakneck action. For a while the production in good 3-D seems to be an amiable story in search of a plot. Still it picks up speed dramatically when Sophie and the BFG formulate a plan to rid England of evil giants. This leads to the two friends having breakfast with the Queen and her corgis at Buckingham Palace in a gloriously funny set piece that is up to the best sequences in the Spielberg canon. (And that raises fart jokes--I mean whizzpopping jokes--to a level of downright distinction.) Gizzardgulper Childchewer Maidmasher Bloodbottler Manhugger Fleshlumpeater Meatdripper Butcher Boy and Bonecruncher surround the BFG. Photo Disney It will be fascinating to see whether young moviegoers accustomed to the frenzied pace of todays entertainments will sit still for the intermittent languors of this one. I hope they will. In the same way that the slow-eating movement encourages us to take our time and savor what we eat Mr. Spielberg wants us to take our time and savor what we see. And pace isnt the only issue here. Far more significant is the quality of the special effects and how the movie uses them. All too often these days special effects arent so special. Computer-generated images can give form and seeming substance to a filmmakers wildest dreams but many CGI sequences are executed so unconvincingly that they can be used only fleetingly their shoddiness minimized by artful editing. The main effects in ""The BFG""--the title character and the other giants--were done by the Weta Digital the same group in New Zealand that created the singular worlds of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Avatar."" Theyre as good as CGI gets which means phenomenal. Instead of having to cut away from the effects Mr. Spielberg dwells on them dotes on them and no wonder; the BFG most notably is an amalgam of star presence and digital enhancement--motion-capture that also captures emotions. The giant talks like a bumbling English rustic walks like an arthritic veteran of the coal mines who can no longer stand up straight runs nonetheless like the wind and has the physiognomy of a hood ornament from some ancient roadster with his forward-thrusting neck aquiline nose triangular face and backward-swept hair. (The digital creations evoke without imitating Quentin Blakes illustrations for the book which was published in 1982.) In Mr. Rylances lovely portrayal the giant seems at first to be melancholy even haunted with downcast eyes downturned mouth and truck-wheel ears as the book describes them that go flat when his spirits sag. Ruby Barnhill and Mark Rylance in The BFG Photo Disney Yet the BFG has the soul of a poet--he hears ""all the secret whisperings of the world""--and hes capable of great happiness in the company of Sophie his new pal and willing abductee. Ruby Barnhill makes Sophie a strong and endearing presence in her own right a fearless pre-teen who tells the giant to be brave when its time for him to come out of the woods and meet the Queen. (""Your magister"" he finally says standing in the garden at Buckingham Palace ""I is your humbug servant."") The Queen is played adroitly rather than forcefully by Penelope Wilton. Rebecca Hall is warm and quietly witty as Mary the Queens secretary and confidante. Rafe Spall is Mr. Tibbs the Palace butler. Of the nine certifiably vile giants the most memorable are played by Jemaine Clement and Bill Hader. Janusz Kaminski was the cinematographer. John Williams did the lush score. One of the good running jokes has to do with frobscottle a green drink whose bubbles fizz downward. Sophie objects to this insisting that the bubbles are going the wrong way. Some may object that the film bubbles too slowly from time to time. But ""The BFG"" has fizz to spare. Its an effervescent charmer. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download Monsters Inc. (2001) Screams not dreams are these monsters specialty but this Pixar classic has much in common with ""The BFG"" Its a dream factorys vision of a scare factory a secret industrial enterprise that lurks behind closet doors in kids bedrooms. The main scarers Sulley and Mike are voiced with fine gusto by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. The film was directed by Pete Docter co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman and written by Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson. James and the Giant Peach (1996) Roald Dahl wrote the book on which Henry Selick based this beguiling phantasmagoria of live action and stop-motion animation. The story line is simpler than the armatures supporting the intricate puppets. A young English boy is orphaned by an accident lives the miserable life of a male Cinderella with two shrewish aunts then makes his escape and sails across the ocean to New York with a crew of adventurous bugs aboard a giant you-know-what.

O. SCOTTJUNE 30 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Mark Rylance in digital makeup and Ruby Barnhill in ""The BFG."" Credit Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures ""The BFG"" -- it stands for ""big friendly giant"" -- is a small friendly movie an attempt to reconcile the scale and dazzle of modern filmmaking with the quiet mischievous charm of Roald Dahls book. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by his frequent collaborator Melissa Mathison (who died in November) it chronicles the relationship between the title character (Mark Rylance) and a young orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill).The Giant at first an embodiment of childhood terrors turns out to be a gentle soul with expressive ears a melancholy countenance and an inventive semi-nonsensical way of talking. Sophie is first his captive -- he plucks her from the orphanage after she spies him sneaking through the nighttime London streets -- and then his ward and pal. He lives in a faraway valley with nine other giants who call him Runt (everything is relative) and mock his vegetarianism. They regard humans (""beans"" in their lingo) as food so he has to protect Sophie from them. Eventually she and the BFG visit the queen (Penelope Wilton) and have a big breakfast with her and her assistants (Rafe Spall and Rebecca Hall).Dahls book is a touching episodic chronicle illustrated with whimsical line drawings by Quentin Blake. Not as dark and nasty as some of Dahls other work for children -- it doesnt have the sinister undertones of ""James and the Giant Peach"" or the rebellious anarchy of ""Matilda"" -- it is touched with sadness as well as with wonder. Mr. Spielberg tries to replicate this delicate mood and compared with other recent entertainment of its kind including some of his own films ""The BFG"" is notably restrained. Video Movie Review The BFG The Times critic A. O. Scott reviews ""The BFG."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date June 30 2016. Photo by Doane Gregory/Disney via Associated Press. The friendly giant is well acquainted with loneliness and grief conditions whose sources are hinted at in ways that may mercifully elude the understanding of the very youngest viewers. And while his carnivorous brethren (led by a lummox named Fleshlumpeater played by Jemaine Clement) are full of slobbery bluster they project all the menace of untrained sheepdogs.The digital effects that render both the Giants person and his surroundings are exquisite. Instead of flash and noise Mr. Spielberg and his visual team (led by his standby cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) go for shimmer and glow with the exception of a few bouts of loud fluorescent flatulence called forth by the bubbly home brew that is the BFGs tipple of choice. Advertisement Continue reading the main story His vocation is collecting dreams flickering webs of light that he catches with a net and stores in carefully labeled jars. We dont see the content of the dreams only their color and shape and they serve both as receptacles for the films gauzy sense of wide-eyed awe and metaphors for its aspirations. Instead of racing through a hectic narrative ""The BFG"" lingers to inhale its own perfume to revel in the inexhaustibly magical potential of cinema. Video Trailer The BFG A preview of the film. By WALT DISNEY PICTURES on Publish Date December 11 2015. Photo by Disney. Watch in Times Video >> embed Mr. Spielberg can only be commended for believing after more than four decades in the business in the gossamer glamour of the moving image. But there is something overly strenuous about this particular testament of faith. Like Martin Scorseses ""Hugo"" another childrens-book adaptation from a high priest of baby-boomer movie worship ""The BFG"" is so committed to inducing a state of breathless wonder that it uses up its own oxygen supply. Adults in the audience are prodded to recapture their long-lost moviegoing innocence while their young companions are patiently directed to giggle warmly or gasp in amazement. But having someone whisper in your ear ""Ooh how mysterious"" or shout ""Isnt that funny?"" has a way of spoiling the desired effect. Mr. Spielberg has always been a skilled manipulator of feeling. Whats startling here is how clumsy and uncertain his attempts seem.Whats missing above all is the wild palpable sense of excitement that has galvanized so many of Mr. Spielbergs other juvenile adventures from ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" to ""The Adventures of Tintin."" His approach to the material is dutiful and appreciative and his devotion to his own craft is impeccable. He lays out an imaginary world in meticulous detail but never grants it full life. There are delights on display but not many surprises. The exception might be Mr. Rylance an extravagantly admired stage actor who was the central enigma and the emotional nexus of Mr. Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies."" ""The BFG"" is a different kind of movie and Mr. Rylances face and body have been enhanced and distorted by digital sorcery but his unique blend of gravity and mischief imbues his fanciful character with a dimension of soul that the rest of the movie lacks.""The BFG"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Quiet sadness and loud flatulence. Running time 1 hour 57 minutes.

Comments The BFG Video Rated PG  115 minutes  2016 A little orphan girl who has trouble sleeping befriends a giant whose job is to capture and distribute dreams and he grants all of hers in short order. (The orphanage she lives in looks cozy she always seems to get her way and she has very few problems so why does she need rescuing?) This sinister tale adapted by Melissa Mathison (E.T. the Extra Terrestrial) from a 1982 childrens book by Roald Dahl ends with the Queen of England marshaling the military to banish a bunch of ""bad"" giants to a remote island. The extravagant expense of this Steven Spielberg production is evident in every frame but no amount of money or technical trickery can make up for a story lacking any dramatic tension or a sympathetic protagonist. The most fantastical aspect here may be the Queen Mother having actual political or military power.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Steven Spielberg loves introducing children to alternate universes and amazing creatures. ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" ""E.T."" and ""Jurassic Park"" arent just technological wonders theyre great original kids adventures. His magic act works less effectively when he makes faithful adaptations of existing childrens classics. His 2011 duo ""War Horse"" and ""The Adventures of Tintin"" deserve polite golf course applause; his Peter Pan remake ""Hook"" was bang-your-head-on-the-desk awful. Now he gives us ""The BFG"" a story of a plucky English orphan girl and a huge gentle fellow trying to stop bigger meaner giants from gobbling British lads and lassies. In the opening a cloaked colossus crosses the late-night streets of London disappearing in shadows whenever passing locals might spy him. Peeking into a large orphanage hes seen by little Sophie slips his huge hand in the window and snatches her up carrying her across pastoral landscapes to Giant Country before she can report him. Back in his cave she worries that shes about to become his breakfast and is relieved to learn that hes a vegan gentleman wiser than his gobbledygook grammar implies -- a Big Friendly Giant indeed. Each treats the other with sympathy and they form an odd friendship like a youngster and grandparent conspiring against a tribe of powerful controlling parent-sized nasties. The live action performance by newcomer Ruby Barnhill as the girl and Mark Rylances work voicing and acting the title role through a computer lens are charming. In his first directing gig for Disney Spielberg gives Roald Dahls 1982 childrens book a polished corporate gloss. Combining motion-capture performance and miraculous computer-generated visuals the machinations are flawless. There is not a shining shaft of sunlight or a green blade of grass that hasnt been beautified. Disney Ruby Barnhill is Sophie in ""The BFG."" Yet to me it feels overdone too literal and not abstract enough to frame this fantasy. Where Dahls book had dozens of wonderfully wobbly illustrations by Quentin Blake his caricatured cartoonish flair has been imitated digitally erased and excessively Botoxed. When you spend time thinking about how lovely the images are rather than following the story the film is missing something. The screenplay by the late Melissa Mathison (who wrote ""The Black Stallion"" and ""E.T."") minimizes the books moments of Brothers Grimm darkness another form of Disney niceness that I wish theyd avoided. Dahls tales are often painfully funny with a kind of fierce satire macabre comedy and ironic detachment that help little readers grasp the worlds complicated realities. Theres a passage in the novel where the BFG explains to Sophie why giants would much rather cannibalize Turkish folk than Greeks that is a riot of politically incorrect hilarity. Removing that moment and more reduces the storys wry tone. Fans of the original will be happy to learn that several scenes of ""whizpopping"" where characters expel rocket-fuel levels of gas made the final cut. In Disneyland nothing beyond genteel naughtiness is allowed. It all adds up to fine family fare and surely fun-packed excitement for kids. But it left me feeling that Spielberg at this point in his life and career is better at thoughtful history-based adult material. Seeing him produce such a trifle is similar to watching a larger-than-life conductor like Leonard Bernstein wave his baton through ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."" He does it with precision not passion. ""The BFG"" isnt Spielbergs highest common denominator. It isnt even Dahls. His spiky worldview is much better served in deliciously wicked versions like Mel Stuarts ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" Nicolas Roegs ""The Witches"" and Wes Andersons ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" ""The BFG"" could have been a whiz-bang but its mostly whizpopping.

Notably the book was published in 1982 the year before ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial"" Spielbergs classic collaboration with writer Melissa Mathison. The two have reunited here made all the more profound by Mathisons death in November at 65. Few conceits are more durable than the foundation of both ""E.T."" and ""The BFG"" the idea of a child having a special relationship with a fantastic creature. Still the result here is ungainly and at times surprisingly dull -- a PG-rated film that could be a little scary in places for younger kids and too simplistic to wow older ones despite the visual effects required to realize its towering title character. Spielbergs first directorial effort for Disney (DIS) thus winds up in a kind of creative no mans land. Its a movie that wouldnt look out of place on the Disney Channel but which of course could never have been made for it due to the A-list talent and whopping budget required to bring its leading man to life. Related Finding Dory feels less buoyant than Nemo As embodied by Mark Rylance -- who earned an Oscar for his last turn with Spielberg in ""Bridge of Spies"" -- the BFG (which stands for ""big friendly giant"") actually has a lot in common with Yoda. Both mangle the language and have oversized ears; its just that one is about 15 times taller. Almost immediately a plucky orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) catches sight of the giant as he prowls the streets of London prompting him to whisk her away to Giant Country. Once there she sees his elaborate workshop and dream-catching devices but must endeavor to avoid detection by his fellow giants who like nothing better than to devour children. (Conveniently the BFG is a confirmed vegetarian.) Those other giants tower over the BFG -- referring to him as ""runt"" -- and treat him terribly. Meanwhile Sophies time among them is constantly perilous leading to one narrow escape after another lest they sniff out her presence. Related Independence Day sequel loses the battle against silliness Just when the movie seems beyond hope the action briefly sparks to life. The energy comes courtesy of a cameo by ""Downton Abbeys"" Penelope Wilton as the Queen of England as well as colorful gusts of giant-infused flatulence. Its a bit too little too late. ""The BFG"" is mostly a big snooze despite the earnest endeavors of Spielberg Mathison and a buoyant John Williams score to create a sense of magic. Even the giants garbled dialogue (""You calls me what you likes"") will yield diminishing returns except perhaps among those who can recite ""Jabberwocky."" The movie carries the dedication ""For our Melissa"" which is alas more moving than almost anything else ""The BFG"" musters. Because despite a giant-sized pedigree this slight production seldom gets airborne much less over the moon.

MOVIE REVIEW THE BFG Running time 115 minutes. Rated PG (action peril farts). Set in a fantasy version of the 1980s in which the queen of England is more worried about child-eating giants than her countrys future economic meltdown Steven Spielbergs adaptation of Roald Dahls classic childrens book is a visually dazzling summer treat. Working under the Disney label for the first time in his career Spielberg offers a gallery of unforgettable images to illuminate a surprisingly straightforward story about the friendship between the Big Friendly Giant of the title and Sophie a spunky 10-year-old orphan. The BFG is played in a splendid motion capture-animation performance by newly minted Oscar winner Mark Rylance (of Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies"") and Sophie (in live action) by charming British newcomer Ruby Barnhill. When Sophie spots the BFG one night on a London street hes so worried about being captured that he spirits Sophie from her orphanage to Giant Country. But not to worry Hes basically a good-hearted (if eccentric) vegetarian and tinkerer looking for a friend. Much of the film is devoted to Sophie getting to know the BFG (his animated visage modeled somewhere between the original books illustrations and Rylance). He speaks in an English patois of ""the tellybunkum box and the radio squeakers"" and manufactures dreams in his elaborately decorated cave for the benefit of human children. But the BFG has to work hard to protect Sophie from the other denizens of Giant Country a male-only preserve of brutes with names like Bonecruncher and Meatdripper. Theyre easily twice the size of the 24-foot BFG -- carnivores whose appetites are whetted when they smell Sophie in their midst. Sophie and her friend elude them in an exciting chase sequence but they learn the giants -- led by fearsome Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) -- are heading to England to feast on some young ""human beans."" The BFG and Sophie descend on Buckingham Palace where they meet the corgi-loving queen (Penelope Wilton) who has just read the alarming news of mass child abductions. After ringing up her White House friend ""Nancy"" (shes informed Nancys husband ""Ronnie"" is sleeping) she has her royal paratroopers deployed to deal with the problem. Spielberg and his screenwriter the late Melissa Mathison (""E.T."") downplay the darker aspects of Dahls book in favor of farce in the final section. This includes her majesty and her corgis sampling a fizzy BFG potion that causes a mass eruption of explosive flatulence in the palace. This is Spielbergs youngest-skewing film since ""The Adventures of Tintin"" and the pacing is uncommonly relaxed for a contemporary film. ""The BFG"" which runs a full two hours might have benefited from slightly tighter editing. Even if it doesnt quite reach the summit of Spielberg classics like ""E.T."" this is still well worth seeing for Rylance and some of the years most beguiling screen images -- from the BFG trying to camouflage himself in the London streetscape to an utterly mesmerizing visit to Dream Country that fans will be replaying for decades.

"The BFG respects Roald Dahls vision review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe BFG respects Roald Dahls vision review Had Steven Spielberg released this screen adaptation of The BFG in 1982 when the Roald Dahl tale about a child and a Big Friendly Giant would have seemed much fresher.Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill are The BFG and friend in The BFG.  (Disney)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 30 2016The BFGStarring Mark Rylance Ruby Barnhill and Penelope Wilton. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Opens Friday at major theatres. 117 minutes. PGSteven Spielberg is in competition only with himself not entirely to his benefit.Had he released this screen adaptation of The BFG in 1982 when the Roald Dahl tale about a child and a Big Friendly Giant was first published hed doubtless have inspired awe and rapture.Article Continued BelowInstead he delivered E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial the same year an instant classic that set a high bar for movies about children and fantasy figures. Its hard to escape the comparison especially since The BFG screenplay was also written by E.T. scenarist Melissa Mathison and the first facial glimpse we have of the title tall guy played by Mark Rylance recalls the considerable shorter outer-space visitor.Which is not to say theres anything wrong with The BFG other than a feeling that Spielberg has trod this path before. Out of respect for Dahl and Mathison both of whom died before the project was realized (Mathison passed just last year) the Hollywood titan also may have been reluctant to meddle too much with the source material.With Rylance his Bridge of Spies star as the giant and new face Ruby Barnhill as his latest child conscript Spielberg at times seems to be in the same somnambulant state that The BFG -- who collects dreams -- is ever eager to induce. (The laid-back attitude also extends to the gentle score by composer John Williams a Spielberg regular and to special effects -- dreams as colourful bottled fireflies -- that enchant more than dazzle.)Rylances word-mangling lug expressively rendered can be both meddlesome and nettlesome. He snatches the precocious young Sophie (Barnhill) from her orphanage bed in urban Blighty and whisking her off to Giant Country somewhere considerably more northern and rural. He doesnt intend to eat her -- God forbid -- although there are nine larger ""man-gobbling cannybulls"" led by a brute-voiced Jemaine Clement who have a taste for tots. The BFG and Sophie find common cause in battling these nastier giants even enlisting the Queen of England who is delightfully played by Downton Abbeys Penelope Wilton as the film follows the expected path toward Spielbergian contentment for young and old alike.Whod have guessed a fart joke involving the Queen would be a highlight of the film? But it is during a delightful second act at Buckingham Palace and its also a rare instance here where Spielberg actually takes a risk.

(Walt Disney Pictures) The BFG"" Roald Dahls beloved adventure tale about a brave little girl who befriends the titular Big Friendly Giant finds Steven Spielberg in his natural element of childlike enchantment yet also strangely out of step his trusted sense of narrative propulsion and pacing occasionally failing him in a saggy draggy second act. Anchored by two winning lead performances ""The BFG"" ultimately overcomes its longueur if only by a hair of the title characters chinny-chin-chin. Sorry thats not a BFG-ism. Indeed much of the enjoyment of ""The BFG"" -- adapted for the screen by the late Melissa Mathison -- derives from the titles characters playful uniquely ""squiggly"" vocabulary as he puts it in which strawberries become ""strawbuncles"" and a television is a ""telly-telly bunkum box."" Hes portrayed here by great British actor Mark Rylance with a wistful vocal cadence and digitally reproduced features that endow his animated likeness with enormous ears and a nose to match. The BFGs chief job in life is to catch dreams and distribute them while people sleep by way of a trumpet-like dream blower. When a precocious orphan named Sophie spies him one night he kidnaps her lest she expose his identity. He takes her back to Giant Country where the two become friends and ultimately allies against the hulking neighbors who bully him mercilessly for preferring vegetables to a diet of tasty ""human beans."" The Big Friendly Giant - a.k.a. ""the BFG"" seated - must contend with big bullying neighbors. (Storyteller Distributuion/Walt Disney Pictures) Theres a fair amount of peril in ""The BFG"" but its considerably softened by the wonder of Sophie finding herself miniaturized in her new friends magical shiplike lair whether shes taking cover in a goopy green snozzcumber or trying her first fizzy sip of frobscottle which results in a particular passing of gas known as a whizzpopper. Portrayed by Ruby Barnhill in a gratifyingly un-cutesy breakout performance Sophie emerges as a courageous resourceful heroine capable of holding her own even when confronted by scary monsters 10 times her height. Working with his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski Spielberg drenches ""The BFG"" in syrupy brown and amber tones a color palette that works well during the films cozy opening scenes but that grows drearier as the story veers into uninvolving effects-heavy set pieces. Once Sophie and the BFG decide to take a journey to capture dreams -- rendered as scurrying balls of light reminiscent of Tinkerbell -- the movie becomes mired in aimless faffing about for its own sake. The BFG kidnaps Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) but then tries to protect her from hungry giants. (Storyteller Distributuion/Walt Disney Pictures) The pace and visual interest perk up considerably when Sophie and the BFG hatch a plan to appeal to the Queen of England for help. Its a scheme that lands them in Her Highnesss bedroom at Windsor (complete with her retinue of dogs) and eventually before a groaning board of deliciously decadent breakfast foods. (Purists beware The filmmakers have tweaked Dahls original finale to satisfy conventional notions of what constitutes a happy ending.) Bright fast-moving and unapologetically gratuitously flatulent the concluding sequences of ""The BFG"" feel utterly of a piece with Spielbergs career-long passion for the collective dream state known as cinema. It takes a pro of his seasoned instincts to know that theres very little in life or in movies that isnt improved by Corgis strawbuncles and cream and a few well-timed whizzpoppers. PG. At area theaters. Contains some scary moments brief rude humor and peril. 110 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

And even when she finally goes to bed she stays up reading -- and occasionally looks out a window that shes been cautioned not to.One night her gaze falls on something it shouldnt have a remarkably thin and incredibly tall figure (Mark Rylance) who catches her looking at him and whisks her away from the orphanage. The next thing Sophie knows shes in a faraway land from which she may never return -- a land of giants.But it turns out that as giants go her captor is relatively small. And unlike his peers he doesnt make a habit of eating children. Hes a big friendly giant and she finds herself warming to his company. In a way theyre both misfits and his vocabulary consists of odd-sounding words that make their own kind of sense. Unfortunately their friendship is constantly threatened by the possibility of one of his neighbors swallowing her. Something has to be done about them -- and it just may require the intervention of Buckingham Palace.Based on the book by Roald Dahl ""The BFG"" finds director Steven Spielberg working from a screenplay by Melissa Mathison -- who penned the great ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982). The new film serves as a tribute to Mathison who died last year at age 65. If ""The BFG"" is unlikely to become a cultural phenomenon of the magnitude of ""E.T."" its a film that casts a unique and often mesmerizing spell. But its also a bit too talky particularly in the early going and Spielberg lets numerous opportunities for humor slip by. But in a performance that couldnt be more different than his turn as a Soviet undercover agent in Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies"" Rylance makes us believe that giants exist.What ""The BFG""  Three stars out of four  Run time 150  Rating PG  Content Action/peril scary moments and rude humor Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags The Bfg Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Mark Rylance Steven Spielberg Sophie Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Steven Spielbergs take on Roald Dahls book has its moments of magic but too often it comes off as a technical exercise.London girl Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is the focus of ""The BFG"" adapted from Roald Dahls book.(Photo Doane Gregory)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 out of 5 starsAt his best Steven Spielberg immerses us in a world of visual wonder making us forget were watching a movie -- were there part of it.Im thinking specifically about ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" because how can you not? Its a miraculous movie a balm to even the most vitriolic Spielberg critics. But theres also the adventure land of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the shell-shocked opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"" the Orwellian near-future of ""Minority Report"" or the ominous ocean in ""Jaws.""Ruby Barnhill plays Sophie in ""The BFG."" (Photo Doane Gregory)Spielbergs latest movie ""The BFG"" would seem like a perfect opportunity to build another world and plop us down in it. The late Melissa Mathison (who wrote ""E.T"") based her script on the Roald Dahl book of the same name. It tells the story of a big friendly giant who kidnaps an orphan girl takes her to Giant Country and hides her from the malicious carnivorous bigger giants. Eventually the two of them enlist the aid of the queen of England to capture the other giants.RELATED Mark Rylance goes big (and friendly) in The BFG | Somethings in the air with BFG and Swiss Army ManWouldnt you love to see what Spielberg could do with such a story? Now you can and while there is some magic here its not the transportive experience it might have been.Why? Its certainly not the fault of Mark Rylance who plays the BFG as Sophie the little girl dubs him. Spielberg uses motion-capture technology to transform Rylance (who won an Oscar for Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies"") into the giant with oversize ears and a mangled vocabulary. Rylance is still recognizable but obviously different. What remains the same is the actors ability to enchant us. Whether hes strangling a sentence or deftly hiding in plain sight in nighttime London Rylance is a constant delight.In ""The BFG"" Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) and the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) become friends. (Photo Storyteller Distribution Co. LLC)Ruby Barnhill is also good as Sophie a tough little customer who isnt scared off by the threat of becoming a main course for the other giants. Once she gets over the anger of being kidnapped she jumps in with both feet insisting on participating in the BFGs adventures including his work as a dream catcher. He traps little wisps of light that form dreams and sneaks into the city late at night to use his trumpet to blow them into the rooms of children.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceTheir trip to catch some dreams is an instance that does capture the Spielberg magic. The look the feel -- its almost tactile. Spielberg plays with light reflection joy and a little bit of danger (there are nightmares too). In this moment we are transported.In others not as much.Penelope Wilton stars as the queen in ""The BFG."" (Photo Doane Gregory)For instance the BFGs overstuffed cave is a visual marvel. Spielberg goes for some cheap laughs with a tiny person in a giants world (Sophie hiding in the disgusting snozzcumbers the vegetarian BFG eats); and vice versa -- the giant trying to read the miniature (to him) book that Sophie has brought with her. But something feels off in much of the film -- or rather it feels like showing off as if Spielberg wants to show us how visually clever he can be. Yet at some point this does nothing to advance the story. It doesnt feel real.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestAt times it feels like we are watching a movie. Of course we are. But in the Spielberg universe theres no greater sin. We may not be participants in the story but we are meant to observe from the inside not the outside. Too often in ""The BFG"" he seems content just to wow us with his technical expertise which it must be acknowledged is amazing. But if it takes you out of the moment then the technology is not serving the story. Its the other way around.Its Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) and the BFG (Mark Rylance) or Big Friendly Giant. (Photo Storyteller Distributuion Co. LLC)Again there are things to love here Rylance first among them. A scene in Buckingham Palace where the queen (Penelope Wilton quite good) serves the BFG breakfast is also pretty swell. Maybe its the mix of source and director. Ive never gone totally in on the theory that Spielberg is too sappy -- its a lazy criticism -- but Dahl does have a kind of sneaky nasty streak in his work. Kids love it because they arent being treated like kids.In this instance perhaps thats the problem. Maybe Spielberg should have gone a little darker with ""The BFG.""

"Steven Spielbergs The BFG reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Mark Rylance Makes Motion-Capture Magic in The BFG Mark Rylance Makes Motion-Capture Magic in The BFG Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 30 2016 1043 AM The BFG Steven Spielbergs Roald Dahl adaptation is a little schmaltzy but theres real magic in Mark Rylances performance. By Dana Stevens Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill in The BFG. Disney To attempt a half live-action half motion-captured adaptation of Roald Dahls classic childrens novel The BFG would seem to indulge in some of the eponymous giants clumsy wordplay a tall task. The story--which Dahl published in 1982 and dedicated to his daughter Olivia who had died 20 years earlier at the age of 7 from complications of measles--revolves entirely around the unlikely friendship between a lonely 10-year-old girl and the 24-foot-tall Big Friendly Giant who plucks her from her bed in a small-town orphanage and runs with her in his pocket back to the Giant Country.  The BFG is a slender little book wordier and more whimsical than it is action-packed and the loose squiggly line drawings that accompany its text--courtesy of longtime Dahl illustrator Quentin Blake--provide whatever sense of movement the story needs. In short The BFG seems perfectly self-sufficient in its bookness in no need of the lavishly cinematic bear hug Steven Spielberg bestows upon it here. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But if Spielbergs warmth and sincerity make for an odd match with Dahls peculiar brand of reserved misanthropy this cinematic BFG does deliver where it counts the giant himself. Played by Mark Rylance in a motion-capture performance the BFG is every bit as vibrant funny and lovable as the flap-eared peaky-nosed creature of Quentin Blakes scribbles speaking with glorious fluency in the half-nonsensical lingo proper to giantkind. ("" How wondercrump cried the BFG still beaming. How whoopsey-splunkers How absolutely squiffling I is all of a stutter. "") Advertisement Any parents wondering whether the PG-rated BFGs central premise--in which after all a defenseless child is lifted from her bed and taken hostage by a fleeing giant--might be too scary for small children should rest assured that its Spielbergs gentleness not Dahls spiky sadism that rules the day from the very first scene. The insomniac bespectacled Sophie (a very good Ruby Barnhill) is scooped up blanket and all and tucked in the giants pocket to be rushed to Giant Country. Theres a fairy-tale sense of adventure rather than a freaky horror-movie vibe as the giants long legs leap from one mountaintop crag to the next as if over lily pads in a pond. Back in the home cave of the BFG it becomes clear that hes spirited Sophie away not to eat her for breakfast but to prevent her from revealing the existence of giants to other humans. But many far bigger and considerably less friendly giants roam the rocky grounds near the BFGs cave most notably the Bloodbottler (played by Bill Hader) and the Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement). These unrepentant ""cannybulls"" like to taunt the comparatively shrimpy BFG about his vegetarian diet of snozzcumbers--a foul slimy vegetable thats the only crop that will grow in the giants land and which the BFG subsists on rather than the favored food of the rest of his tribe. When Sophie comes to understand that that favored food consists of the small-size ""human beans"" referred to by the BFG as ""chiddlers"" her sense of justice is roused and she plots with the BFG to inform the queen about this worldwide child-snatching (and -snacking) epidemic. On the road between Giant Country and Buckingham Palace there are swoopingly animated chase sequences and comical giant-bonkings to spare but The BFG is easiest to appreciate when it takes the time to enjoy its own sweet silliness. A late scene in which Sophie and the politely abashed BFG finally sit down to breakfast with the queen (Penelope Wilton) proceeds at a stately yet enjoyable crescendo from social awkwardness to rude mayhem as royal waiters scale ladders to proffer the BFG huge platters of eggs and toast and buckets of coffee while he in turn offers his human hosts a bottle of frobscottle the delicious but flatulence-inducing preferred beverage of giants. The screenplay (co-written by Spielberg and his longtime collaborator Melissa Mathison who died in 2015) has neatly dispensed with some of the novels more unpleasant elements like the narrators casually colonialist musings about the taste of ""human beans"" of different nationalities (would Grecians be greasy?) or the grisly details of some of the ""cannybull"" giants kills. The focus here is much more on friendship trust and finding ones true family--familiar themes all and presented with trademark Spielberg schmaltz. Rylances tender and deeply invested performance should convince any remaining doubters that motion-capture technology is now advanced enough to have created a new category of on-screen incarnation the performance of an actor or actress who may be wearing a digital full-body mask but who is nonetheless truly and powerfully acting.  Whether that form of acting should be classed alongside traditional performances come awards season or given a new category of its own is up for debate; its evident though that we cant go much longer without recognizing such remarkable technical and artistic co-creations. The bottomless emotional reserve of Rylance--who just won a supporting actor Oscar for Spielbergs Bridge of Spies and is slated to star in the directors next two films a sci-fi dystopia and a historical drama--makes the sometimes galumphing BFG more than a mere pleasant afternoon of family viewing. Rylances debut in the strange new world of motion-capture performance is jumbly its delumptious its positively squiffling. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Courtesy of Storyteller Distributuion Co. LLC Based on the classic childrens book by Roald Dahl Steven Spielbergs fantasy The BFG is a labor of love that sometimes wears its love too laboriously but a surfeit of rapture isnt the worst thing in a movie -- especially when its director has a genius for translating emotion into the rising and falling of his camera or laugh-out-loud disjunctions in scale. You shouldnt look this big friendly giant in the mouth especially if he has just eaten a snozzcumber. He probably has given that those ucky-mucky syntheses of cucumbers and snot are a major part of his diet. Unlike the big unfriendly giants who surround him the BFG has no appetite for ""human beans."" His main activity -- besides cooking snozzcumbers -- is fashioning dreams to be blown into the heads of children and other sleeping human beans. Before you say ""How syrupy"" you should know that some of those dreams are scary and that the BFG is also given to drinking carbonated beverages in which the bubbles go down instead of up and emitting earthshaking ""whiz-poppers"" from his big friendly backside. The BFG has a sublime visual running gag. In the first few moments a cat scurries through the orphanage in which the movies young protagonist Sophie (the spirited Ruby Barnhill) unhappily resides and enters the frame like a monster. But the cat is dwarfed by Sophie whos subsequently dwarfed by the BFG -- who reaches through her window when she spies him at 3 a.m. moving through the city with his trumpets and his dreams. The BFG carries her off bounding over buildings and into another realm but just as weve adjusted to his immensity hes dwarfed by the enormous nasty Fleshlumpeater whod regard Sophie as a rare delicacy. You wonder if theres someone bigger yet. Dahl wrote The BFG in the last decade of his life and said that it was his favorite of his works. Perhaps at six-foot-six he identified with the giants estrangement from humanity or perhaps he saw himself as a cranky outcast putting dreams into childrens heads. The BFG combines his love of stretching words out like taffy with his affection for scatological humor with his abiding respect for the military (he flew perilous combat missions in World War II) which arrives in the giants land via helicopter at the behest of the queen indignant over the eating of Englands children. The BFGs screenplay was written by Melissa Mathison who also wrote E.T. Despite the inevitable comparisons the two films have little in common. What made E.T. so vivid was not just the bond between a child and a being from another realm. It was E.T.s suburban-American setting. My view is that Spielberg does better when theres some tension between his magically fluid technique and an essentially realistic textured world. The BFG doesnt have that grounding and in the films middle section when Sophie and the giant fly around collecting dreams and whatnot and composer John Williams goes heavy on the airy-fairy flutes I started to get a bit woozy-snoozy. I could watch and listen to Mark Rylances BFG forever though. Is his CG visage a little too dear for a Dahl creature? Yes but his cracked tender Cockney voice with its ebbs and flows is exquisite and he all but sings those made-up words that tickle the ear and confound the spell-checker. Watching him slurp down a dozen runny fried eggs in Buckingham Palace and fart with serenity you might think youve never seen such a perfect fusion of a radiant old soul and a toddler.

(Photo courtesy Disney/TNS) Nancy Churnin The Dallas Morning News nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com A whimsical adaptation of Roald Dahl classic shimmers like a BFG dream (A-) Jun. 29 2016 316pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Nancy Churnin Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Theres a gentle whimsical E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial quality to Steven Spielbergs latest film The BFG which shouldnt surprise given that both scripts were written by the late Melissa Mathison. As with the lonely boy and the alien in the wildly popular 1982 film this lyrical adaptation of Roald Dahls 1982 book sets up two seemingly opposite characters who are able to help each other once they realize they share the same heart.Sophie (the appealing Ruby Barnhill) is as tiny powerless and fearful as the giant who snatches her from her orphanage seems big and powerful. Once she gets to know the giant (Mark Rylance) and begins to sort her way through his gloriously garbled language she finds out he is tiny powerless and fearful in Giant Country where the others who tower over him call him Runt. This image released by Disney shows Ruby Barnhill right and the Big Friendly Giant from Giant Country voiced by Mark Rylance in a scene from""The BFG."" Disney via AP While other giants eat human ""beans"" (their word for human beings) he sticks to disgusting snozzcumbers even though he hates them because he doesnt want to hurt anyone. Sophie calls him BFG for Big Friendly Giant and together they brainstorm for ways to save both humans and the BFG from the giants. It takes both a wizardly hand with effects and an honest one with performances to pull off a believable fantasy with two such differently sized characters. Spielberg brings a tangible sense of reality to a magical place where the BFG catches and catalogs dreams that whiz by in bright shimmering colors. Rylance with an irresistible mix of wizened age and eternal youth in his look makes us believe in his mission to make the world a better place by sorting mixing and bottling these dreams. As their unbelievable scheme which includes the Queen of England (a delightfully dignified Penelope Wilton) unfolds the situation gets as frothy as the BFGs favorite drink frobscottle where the bubbles go down rather than up.

EntertainmentMovies The BFG a magical take on Roald Dahls classic tall tale Originally published June 30 2016 at 1200 am Updated June 30 2016 at 1144 am Movie review of The BFG Steven Spielbergs delightful film dreams big -- and succeeds. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Roald Dahls ""The BFG"" begins in the middle of the night; that magic hour of 3 a.m. when everythings hushed and in the books words ""all the dark things come out from hiding and [have] the world to themselves."" Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) an insomniac girl living in a London orphanage goes to the window to look out onto the quiet wet street and sees a black-cloaked giant striding down the cobblestones taller than a house. Soon an enormous hand whisks her from her bed -- and into an astonishing adventure. First published in 1982 the book joined Dahls long list of classic quirkily funny books for children. (Also among them ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" ""James and the Giant Peach"" ""Matilda"" ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and if you didnt grow up with at least a couple of these you missed something.) ""The BFG"" was previously made into an animated movie in 1989 but really it seems to have been waiting for Steven Spielberg to come along. The new film made with a mixture of live-action performance and digital techniques is at its heart a story about dreams beautifully captured in magical jewel-toned light. The BFG (Big Friendly Giant despite whatever R-rated possibility might occur to you) played by recent Academy Award winner Mark Rylance (""Bridge of Spies"") is you see a dream-gatherer. A kind gentle creature who speaks in a delightfully fractured language (this giant has apparently read ""Finnegans Wake"") he catches dreams as they go ""whiffling through the night air"" bottles them and distributes them to sleeping children. And hes a vegetarian eating only vile snozzcumbers -- unlike his nastier giant brethren who dine on ""human beans"" and would gobble Sophie up if only they could find her. Movie Review    The BFG with Mark Rylance Ruby Barnhill Penelope Wilton Jemaine Clement Rebecca Hall Rafe Spall Bill Hader. Directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Melissa Mathison based on the book by Roald Dahl. 110 minutes. Rated PG for action/peril some scary moments and brief rude humor. Several theaters. Much of ""The BFG"" perhaps a little too much is devoted to watching Sophie madly scurry away from the giants; its a beautifully rendered chase but still just a chase. When the movie slows down to allow Rylance and Barnhill to converse it finds its magic. Rylance digitally rendered from motion-capture performance finds a charming gentle rapport with his young co-star and his lilting wordplay (a television is a ""telly telly bunkum box""; language is ""a twitch-tickling problem"") creates its own music. And the third act in which we learn of the complications that can ensue when a queen (Penelope Wilton) invites a giant to the palace for breakfast is a delight. (Hint Make plenty of toast.) My 11-year-old assistant (who hadnt read the book but now wants to) pronounced it all good fun -- ""a solid three-and-a-half stars."" Im knocking off half a star but overall agree with him Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and screenwriter Melissa Mathison (""E.T.""; this was her last script before her death last year) find some moments of genuine magic. ""Make them all happy"" Sophie urges the BFG as he prepares to spread an evenings worth of dreams. This film will likely have just that effect on its watchers.

His usually did. Dahl was a horny drunken handsome jerk who did a lot of that other type of F-ing. Just tell your local toddler that he was very very friendly. Britains controversial author amused himself penning short stories about 7-foot penises. (Sorry to break it to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fans but ""snozzberry"" was his slang for dick.) When he wanted to make money he scribbled something for the kids like this hasty tale about an orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) whisked from London to the land of the giants. The double entendre in The BFG must have made him snort with glee especially when it became a best seller the year after his publishers threatened to cancel his book deal due to Dahls ""utter lack of civility."" Revenge explains why a writer known for his mellifluous nonsense -- crodsquinkled gunzleswiped Oompa-Loompa -- saddled a major character with blunt initials that roll off the tongue like peanut butter. Dahls editors tidied up the book mopped up most of his racism and made millions of dollars. The BFG kept in his cute mock-bigotry like how his man-eating giants think that Danes taste like dogs Turks taste like turkey and Greeks are too greasy. That decade Dahl openly admitted to The Independent that he had ""become anti-Semitic."" To his young readers he was still their daffy great-uncle. Now here comes Steven Spielberg to scrub him even cleaner with this big-budget live-action adventure. Today the giants arent even food critics. Theyre happy to eat all nations as long as Spielberg doesnt actually scare children by showing them feast. Dahls shiver of cannibalism sold books -- kids love ghouls -- but this generation of Helicopter Parent Hollywood brightens the darkness. The BFG (voiced by new Oscar winner Mark Rylance) is a 30-foot mouse. Hes hunched and hushed a librarian blown up as big as Godzilla. Sophie the girl he kidnaps from her bedroom isnt scared of him for a second even though the audience isnt sure well survive the lurching 3-D POV of their sprint to his home. DisneyDespite their size difference brave Sophie seems almost as big as he is especially when the other nine giants on his island crowd into his cabin to smash his wondergizmos and accuse him of hiding their human supper. A pack of skyscraper-size cannibals sharing a tot is as preposterous as the New England Patriots carving up a sardine. But her escapes are fun -- she ducks under furniture and shimmies inside a slimy gourd -- and what the plucky Sophie sheds in emotional nuance she makes up for in gawky guts. Its nice to see a girl heroine with a terrible haircut who when given a heap of dresses to wear picks a military jacket. Sophie and the BFG settle into a relationship thats part sibling and part pet toggling between whos in charge. She demands that he confront his bullies. He mentors her about the world of dreams. In a lovely sequence he takes her to a meadow where fantasies flit like butterflies captures them in a jar and gently blows them up a humans nostrils. These electric visions glow yellow and blue and red. Picture neon twisted up into any dream you can imagine guitars Ferris wheels spidery nightmares. Spielbergs waking dreams arent much different. He can imagine anything with pixels. Yet the animation needs more magic. Its an awkward blend of realism and fantasy that should have just chosen to go full cartoon. Sophie seems to float in the BFGs hand. Scenes are cluttered with details I longed to savor like the quickest glimpse of a phone booth in the giants kitchen repurposed to store what enormous spatulas? In one gag three Corgis skid across a floor propelled by glowing green flatulence. It got a big laugh but the smiles come from simpler pleasures a shot of Sophies cat sitting on her blanket the BFGs lonely ears tracking the girl like a flower soaking up sun. When he tells her he can detect the tiniest voices from an insect to an alien I swooned. We dont have to see wonder to feel it. Alas Spielberg cant fix The BFGs strange second act where Dahl has Sophie call in the army to combat the Bigger Mean Giants. Its a story in which firepower triumphs over ingenuity the kind of go-go militarism that makes sense for a book published the same year Margaret Thatcher smashed up the Falklands. You dont get good drama when your character simply tattles to the Queen. Clearly Spielberg knows the best kids movies make children their own heroes Elliot can save E.T. two siblings can outwit raptors Goonies never say die. Hes aware that the toughest lesson parents instill is that scared children must prove they can protect themselves. Otherwise you raise people who cling to authority and fear strangers -- close-mindedness that creates frightened adults who vote to kick out the Danes Turks and Greeks. That Brexit just arose out of the same impulses made this unbloodied beautified The BFG send colder shivers down my spine a chill that whistled over the lovely final image of the film Sophie whispering hello to her giant friend from miles and miles away comforted that Big Brother is listening.

Photo Doane Gregory Associated Press Spielberg makes it big with exquisite effects in ""The BFG"" 1 / 4 Back to Gallery With Steven Spielberg everything is always just a little bit better. Theres an atmosphere of enchantment about ""The BFG"" that is not imposed by the soundtrack or jolted into artificial life by overdone close-ups and exaggerated performances. Rather its the product of an investment in every aspect of every frame guided by an inspired and thorough vision of what the movie must be. Based on the 1982 childrens novel by Roald Dahl ""The BFG"" lacks some of the emotional depths we find in the best Spielberg movies and though it fully recovers well before the finish it has a distinct sag in its middle. Still this is one of the standout movies of the season combining some lovely acting with extraordinary special effects. Its a funny thing. You can see a thousand movies and think that youve become immune to dazzling visuals -- until you see them done right. With most CGI-heavy films the artistry hasnt caught up with the possibilities. Not here. Spielberg knows that being able to show a giant hand scooping a little girl out of her bed is only half the challenge. Figuring out a way to do it so that the audience feels awed and amazed is in the realm of art. Its not enough that things happen. How they happen is all-important. And so a simple scene in which an 11-year-old girl stands on the kitchen counter of a giant as he makes his dinner becomes a joy to watch because of all the imaginative ways in which the scene is staged. She sits in a metal bowl and as he pounds away on a cutting board the bowl starts to shake and revolve. And because this is Spielberg who is always attentive to his actors the human aspect is never lost in such moments. So its not just a bowl spinning with someone inside it but a bowl spinning with a specific person inside it reacting in a distinct way. The girl in the bowl Sophie is played by Ruby Barnhill who is as much of a find as Drew Barrymore was in Spielbergs ""E.T."" She has a face that could only be English and a quality of intelligence that makes her seem like a 35-year-old stuck in a childs body. Sophie is a child in an orphanage but as soon as we see her we recognize her as a great soul just waiting for the freedom of adulthood -- or for the adventure that comes with being in a childrens story. Sophie is such an active intelligence that she is already an insomniac and so she is the one person awake to see the B(ig) F(riendly) G(iant) (Mark Rylance) skulking in his black cape towering over the low buildings of London. When he sees her of course he plucks her out of her bed and takes her with him because he doesnt want her telling everyone of his existence. As if anyone would believe her. Like the best of childrens stories it takes place in a world that swings between kindness and cruelty. The BFG is gentle and thoughtful but there are other giants -- bigger nastier ones -- whose favorite thing in life is to eat children. The BFG is virtually defenseless against them and whats even worse these evil giants can smell children when theyre in the vicinity. This is an altogether depressing situation and in that middle section it appears the story may become just about a girl talking to a friendly giant in between interludes in which bad giants barge in and knock over all the furniture. Leavening some of that misery is a trip that Sophie and BFG take to a dream world -- the BFGs life work is to capture peoples dreams and sometimes to craft and instill them. Its easy to imagine Rylance with his distant dreamy quality doing just that or even to see his acting as its real-world equivalent. But even then for a short but notable period the film becomes sluggish and the dream element seems merely a bit of extraneous fancy. In fact this is not the case and in the last 40 minutes of ""The BFG"" the palette brightens and all the elements come together. The movie becomes inventive in new ways and even cheery. Its a true delight. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. Email mlasallesfchronicle.com Twitter MickLaSalle The BFG Starring Ruby Barnhill and Mark Rylance.

(Disney via AP) ORG XMIT NYET734 Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Sign-Up for Chicago Sun-Times Entertainment Newsletter Receive Theater Celebrity amp; Entertainment related Updates Sign-Up Exiting the theater after the technically impressive but listless and tedious ""The BFG"" I wondered Of the more than 50 films Steven Spielberg has directed was this my least favorite? No I havent forgotten about ""The Adventures of Tintin"" or ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" or ""Hook"" or ""1941."" But if I had to rank all of the Spielberg-directed films from the myriad four-star classics through the terrific but slightly lesser movies down to the very small handful of misses I think Id rather see every one of Spielbergs previous films before having to sit through ""The BFG"" again. Its not awful. Im not sure Spielberg could deliver a thudding clunker if he tried. But its painfully cutesy silly and gross rather than whimsical and funny -- and it moves so slowly I got to the point where I found myself thinking ""BFD"" about the BFFs in ""The BFG."" Set in the Great Britain (and Giant Country) of the 1980s ""The BFG"" gets off to a promising start with a nifty late-night sequence in which the adorable and precocious orphan girl Sophie (Ruby Barnhill all plunk and spunk with little subtlety) wanders around the cavernous and cold and forbidding orphanage deep into the witching hour -- telling herself not to get out of bed not to go to the window and not to throw open the curtains which of course she does every night. This leads to a sighting of one Big Friendly Giant (voiced by ""Bridge of Spies"" Oscar winner Mark Rylance) who has no choice but to scoop her up and take her to Giant Country lest she spill the beans about his existence. As is the case with all Spielberg fantasies the special effects are terrific and the attention to detail in the sets is so vibrant and precise it almost distracts from the action in the foreground. Spielberg and his team have done a marvelous job of bringing Roald Dahls 1982 illustrated childrens book to big-screen 3D life. (Heres no surprise The 3D is underwhelming. The 3D is underwhelming in about 95 percent of 3D films.) One of the big problems with ""The BFG"" Life in Giant Country isnt particularly exciting or interesting or even all that scary even though its supposed to be at least scary. Its kind of a drag truth to tell. Maybe that orphanage aint looking so bad after all kid. Turns out that even at 24 feet the BFG is known as ""Runt"" by the nine other giants in his village (such as it is) who appear to be about three times his size and about 1/10th as intelligent.  (Theyre all male giants which could explain why these behemoths are so grumpy all the time.) Led by the grunting drooling and disgusting Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) the giants bully Runt with nasty fervor and spend nearly every waking moment either hunting down human beings aka ""beans"" or roaring about how they love the taste of human beings. Theyre a grotesque dim-witted bunch and other than their leader they have no distinctive personality traits. In this movie a little Supporting Player Giant goes a long way. Meanwhile the BFG talks in a patience-stretching language known as Gobblefunk in which commons words are rearranged in a manner that plays well on the written page but is more annoying than amusing on film. All the ""squibbling"" and ""ucky-mucky"" and ""whoopsey-splunkers"" and ""squiffling"" and ""delumptious"" talk will. Wear. You. Down. Also about the 10th time little Sophie wails ""BFG BFG"" I was expecting him to say ""WHAT Cant you just sit and READ for a little while"" Nobody tops Spielberg when it comes to heart-tugging moments involving a child and an otherworldly creature and the bond between Sophie and the BFG will indeed grab you from time to time. Whats largely missing is the sense of wonder and adventure. The BFG works in the field of dreams and were not talking Iowa cornfields. He catches dreams he brews dreams -- and deep into the night he gently prowls the streets of London using a trumpet of sorts to literally blow specific dreams into the sleep cycles of little boys and girls. Its a cool concept but the onscreen visualization of the dreams themselves while competent doesnt reach out and stun us on the level weve come to expect from Spielberg. Even less satisfying is a stunningly unfunny and overlong sequence in which Sophie and the BFG visit the queen (Penelope Wilton from ""Downton Abbey"") who decides its a grand idea to invite the giant into Buckingham Palace and serve him the worlds largest breakfast -- even though Sophie and the BFG have just told her about nine giants who are gobbling up the children of England. Come on Queenie. Get it together. Stop feeding the friendly giant and go get the ones who are EATING THE CHILDREN.  Walt Disney presents a film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison based on the book by Roald Dahl. Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG (for action/peril some scary moments and brief rude humor). Opens Friday at local theaters.

BFD. A big filmmaking disappointment (wait what did you think I meant?) Steven Spielbergs new childrens picture is just harmless babysitting an easy way to spend and mostly waste two hours. And people deserve a little more for their admission price - especially from filmmakers who remade what a family movie could be. After all Spielberg - among many other things - directed ""E.T."" His screenwriter here the late Melissa Mathison wrote that too (and ""The Black Stallion""). Together they pushed the genre forward. ""The BFG"" pulls it back. A slightly scrubbed adaptation of the Roald Dahl book the film takes place for no good reason in the 1980s where Sophie lives in a cliched orphanage bunking in a crowded dormitory and reading Dickens. Then one night she sees a giant. And since he doesnt like being seen he kidnaps her. But this is a big friendly giant - or BFG as Sophie soon names him - who spends his nights trapping childrens nightmares while giving them good dreams. And also hiding from the bigger unfriendly giants who unlike him are not only meateaters but maneaters. The storyline is clear - Sophie and the BFG will become friends help each other then join forces to defeat the nasty goliaths. Its how to get to that point that Spielberg and Mathison cant quite figure out. Although Mark Rylances motion-capture performance as the giant is charming - you just know this Shakespearean actor loved wrapping his tongue around the giants peculiarly mangled English - the untested Ruby Barnhill isnt all that much of a find as Sophie. She has two emotions bossy or scared - one more than the BFG who is merely meek - and theres nothing to their relationship. Nor is there much plot to the movie. Eventually the two return to England where they convince Queen Elizabeth to mount a military action against the cannibal behemoths. She immediately dispatches the troops (which of course she could not do in real life but at least spares the filmmakers from having to drag in Meryl Streep as Thatcher). Things end happily of course but not soon enough. And without having given us a good reason why were watching all this. The 3D movie is so computer-enhanced so green-screened that even the ""real"" sets and people feel faked and the other meaner giants arent particularly well-imagined - they just run together in a blur of bare noggins and bad teeth. Rylances character is better and his voice is marvelous (enough so that I wished this was an audiobook instead of a movie with the actor merely reading Dahl). Spielberg too has put a lot of thought into the interiors - the BFGs lair a crowded mix of salvaged and repurposed items is kind of wonderful. But there are no real characters here very little adventure and few jokes beyond some tired ones about passing gas (which giants enjoy doing and in large ""Shrek""-green clouds). Strip away Rylances vocal performance and the expensive effects and you have little more than two hours of precocious children silly adults and corny gags. Or exactly the sort of safe stupid family movie Spielberg and Mathison once promised to save us from. Ratings note The film contains some scary scenes and bathroom humor.

"The BFG review Oscar-winner Rylance delightful to watch in Spielberg adaptation - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The BFG review Oscar-winner Rylance delightful to watch in Spielberg adaptation Clip The BFG Watch a clip from ""The BFG."" (Walt Disney Pictures) Watch a clip from ""The BFG."" (Walt Disney Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Theres a lot not quite right and even flat-out wrong with ""The BFG"" and well get to that. Theres also a lot thats very very right starting with Mark Rylances astonishing performance-capture portrayal of the Big Friendly Giant created by author Roald Dahl. The right stuff makes it worth seeing.Like millions of other kids I cherished the droll wish-fulfillment sadism of Dahls earlier works ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" though my relationship to ""The BFG"" (published in 1982) is strictly after-the-fact. (I read it after seeing the movie.) Director Steven Spielberg 69 and screenwriter Melissa Mathison who wrote ""E.T."" and ""The Black Stallion"" and who died in 2015 struggled for years to figure out how to film ""The BFG."" The director claimed he needed to wait for digital cinematic technology to catch up with the storys fantastical demands. The BFG Walt Disney Studios Ruby Barnhill and Mark Rylance star in ""The BFG"" adapted from a Roald Dahl story and directed by Steven Spielberg. Ruby Barnhill and Mark Rylance star in ""The BFG"" adapted from a Roald Dahl story and directed by Steven Spielberg. (Walt Disney Studios) While the results on that score are mixed the actor born to play the resident sweetie of Giant Country who befriends the 10-year-old orphan Sophie turns out to have been fully worth the wait. Rylance a supremely versatile stage and screen actor is Spielbergs new favorite guy. They collaborated on ""Bridge of Spies"" for which Rylances performance as Russian spy Rudolf Abel won a supporting actor Oscar. They have two more joint projects on the runway ""Ready Player One"" science fiction followed by the historical drama ""The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara.""What Rylance accomplishes in ""The BFG"" is akin to what Andy Serkis achieved as Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy or what Serkis brought to the ""Planet of the Apes"" remakes. But theres something new going on here more dimensional and interesting. For one thing they finally got the teeth and eyes right. For another the digital completion of the performance feels more like performance capture than performance erasure. Rylance is not defeated by the technology. In this sort of motion-capture assignment the actor wears a heavily wired bodysuit and performs the scenes which later get filled in and fleshed out visually by other means other creative artists. The actor is the line drawing; the finished product the digital animation/live-action hybrid becomes the full-color illustration.The lanky 24-foot giant at the heart of Dahls story has enormous sensitive ears as well as a fantastically creative penchant for malaprops and parallel-universe verbiage. My favorite ""telly-telly bunkum box"" for TV set though in a few years well have to explain a TV set to the young people.Ruby Barnhill plays the bespectacled insomniac Sophie who spies the BFG one night skulking around her English Midlands village. Worried shell tell on him the giant plucks Sophie from her orphanage bed and whisks her off to Giant Country. Like the book the movie gets right to it no exposition or horsing around and everything about the way Spielberg and his team imagine the first 20 minutes is just about perfect especially the degree and the tone of the scariness which never feels harsh or assaultive.MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR The plot has been streamlined and softened by Mathison who stripped it of Dahls gleefully patronizing colonialist wisecracks (references to Greece Iraq and other nations plagued by child disappearances and apparent kid-munching). It stays close to Sophies perspective. Through her eyes we learn the BFGs profession (dream catcher) and his lot in life (bullying victim of the nine ""cannybull"" giants who torment him voiced and motion-captured by Jemaine Clement and Bill Hader among others). Sophie sticks up for him and he for her and together they pay a visit to the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) to convince her that giants exist and that the horrible nine must be dealt with.Is it enough for a satisfying screen fantasy particularly when so much of the books appeal relies on Dahls exquisite verbal flourishes? This is where Spielbergs film seems destined to become a splitter with restless audiences on one side charmed audiences on the other. Watching ""The BFG"" I spent time in both camps.The action sequences where Sophie scurries out of sight in the BFGs cottage to avoid being seen by the cannybull giants favor elaborate extended Rube Goldberg physical comedy. Theyre fun for a while and then they go on and then on some more. In this regard ""The BFG"" is the precise opposite of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" Spielbergs 2011 motion-capture extravaganza; in that picture the chases were the only scenes that clicked. In ""The BFG"" you keep waiting for the character stuff to take center stage again because it actually matters and works.Spielberg tips his hat to all sorts of earlier filmmakers usually on the fly from Hitchcock (a close-up of Sophies eyeglasses recalls a shot from ""Strangers on a Train"") to Kubrick (not one but two musical selections come from the same classical songlist ""Barry Lyndon"" used). Most of the music is original composed by John Williams writing some of his most delicate and intriguing material in a while. Yet the sheer volume of scoring works against the magic.The best scenes take their time I loved the massive brunch prepared by the queens staff for the BFGs introduction to the highest high society though the fart jokes (the book had them more selectively) recall the live-action ""Flubber"" and I dont mean that as a compliment. Up and down down and up the movie goes and inarguably its 20 minutes longer than Dahls compact story requires. Yet I was so tickled and moved by Rylances interpretation highly emotional in surprising ways the problems didnt matter much to me. For once underneath all the motion capture folderol the key performance really does feel like a full real vital performance.Michael Phillips is a Tribune Newspapers critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribuneMPAA rating PG (for action/peril some scary moments and brief rude humor) Running time 157""The BFG"" -- 3 stars Opens Thursday eveningMORE FROM MICHAEL PHILLIPSIndependence Day Resurgence review Will Smiths the lucky oneHow Independence Day Armageddon and others bred the schlockbuster Caption Trailer Bad Moms Watch the trailer for ""Bad Moms.""

DisneySophie (Ruby Barnhill) looks at the sights of Giant Country with her big new friend (Mark Rylance) in The BFG.(Photo Disney)Amid a vocabulary-challenged big man a precocious orphan and some flatulent corgis director Steven Spielberg creates a colorful landscape full of kid-friendly sights in The BFG.An adaptation of Roald Dahls 1982 childrens book of the same name The BFG ( out of four; rated PG; in theaters nationwide Friday) stars Oscar winner Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies) as the voice and likeness of the very large computer-generated title character who befriends the young ""human bean"" Sophie (Ruby Barnhill).The BFG (short for ""Big Friendly Giant"") delicately takes the British girl to his home -- to keep her from alerting the proper authorities that a 24-foot-tall dude is running around -- and the twosome set off on a grand adventure that goes from the streets of London to Giant Country to Buckingham Palace.USA TODAYNew BFFs Spielberg Rylance team up for The BFG and big things beyondFor some it might be a little too safe. Theres never a sense that Sophie is in any real danger even when surrounded by a bunch of ginormous cannibalistic giants who mock the relatively runt-sized BFG. While the screenplay expands Dahls plot its still very much on the simplistic side albeit perfect for a younger crowd.With huge ears and a bigger heart the BFG takes Sophie under his wing and shows her his world which includes his vegetarian diet of fetid snozzcumbers and a vast collection of bottled dreams (good and bad but always visually beautiful) that he gives out to sleeping children. Full of adolescent attitude Sophie initially wants to go back home to her cat and orphanage but falls for the (to her) massive world and the BFGs personality and wacky way for words (for example ""strawbunkles"" for strawberries).Penelope Wilton and Sophie Barnhill in The BFG. (Photo Doane Gregory)The Fleshlumpeater (voiced by Jemaine Clement) and his posse of man-eating giants become a problem for BFG and Sophie so the girl ends up getting the Queen (Penelope Wilton) involved though the movies royal sequence is a means to a happy ending and one epic fart joke. (Gas is a running theme because for the BFG ""whizpopping"" is ""true happiness."")Spielberg smartly utilizes the strengths of many of his usual collaborators starting with his latest one. Through performance capture Rylance brings a gentle goodness but also a world-weary gravitas to the BFG -- there is tragedy to his story that he has to overcome. While the BFG himself is a remarkable special effect there are a few CGI stumbles inserting a little girl into his world and trying to make it look real.USA TODAYDahls The BFG makes a giant leap on USA TODAYs listJohn Williams composes a sprawling effervescent score that while not his best certainly captures the musical magic that makes his partnership with Spielberg so special.The movie also acts as a tribute to screenwriter Melissa Mathison who died of cancer in November. Although E.T. will always be Mathisons shining Spielbergian moment she explored a similar childish wonder in adapting The BFG weaving in a sense of melancholy amid themes of bravery and tolerance. Whether its a young boy hanging with an alien or a little English girl with a big buddy the promise of an otherworldly friend is a gift thats often fleeting.With its lack of dramatic action The BFG doesnt rise to the ranks of the directors family-friendly best but its still a frothbuggling jumpsquiffling good time. 39 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/29c2VUN",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/29/review-the-bfg-movie/86464998/,200,thebfg34,thebfg,usatoday
"Review Listless BFG makes effective bedtime story - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Listless BFG makes effective bedtime storyBy Karen DSouza kdsouzabayareanewsgroup.comPosted 06/28/2016 113228 AM PDTUpdated 06/29/2016 043533 PM PDT A great big giant dubbed Runt kidnaps a little girl in the listless bedtime story ""The BFG.""Quirky is the coin of the realm in Steven Spielbergs bloated bland 3-D movie adaptation of Roald Dahls 1982 fantasy ""BFG."" Nothing could be prettier but alas the movie lacks magic.Wryly voiced by Oscar winner Mark Rylance the gangly Runt whisks little Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) away from her dreary orphanage only to deliver her to a realm of flesh-eating giants with a taste for tots.Runt has been branded a freak because hes a vegetarian who prefers snozzcumbers (which ooze in putrescent 3-D splendor) to skin -- not a popular choice in Giant Country. This dark demented land is ruled by a carnivorous oaf named Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) who loves to snack on small children. Ruby Barnhill as Sophie and the BFG (Big Friendly Giant) portrayed by Mark Rylance in The BFG. (Disney) ( Disney ) Echoing Spielbergs iconic ""E.T."" -- which like ""BFG"" was written by the late Melissa Mathison but falls far short of the earlier screenplays power -- ""BFG"" deserves praise for how true it tries to stay to the eccentricity of Dahls world. An impressive effort has gone into making things look just so from the hidden crannies of BFGs cave to the various and sundry cakes the Queen has at tea. The visuals shine in Spielbergs first collaboration with Disney particularly Rylances motion-capture performance and Janusz Kaminskis lush cinematography. But the fable itself lacks drive. Once the wonder of this world has sunk in theres nowhere to go in this film which can lull you straight into torpor. Advertisement Unwittingly Spielberg has toned down the darkness that makes Dahl unique. Throughout the writers work from ""Charlie and Chocolate Factory"" to ""Matilda"" there is an acknowledgement of lifes shadows that makes his embrace of the fanciful all the more potent. The lows that must be overcome by the children in his stories makes their victories sweeter.Here however there is very little texture to Sophies character. Barnhill is suitably cute but Sophie seems generic almost blank. Weve got nothing invested in her so her adventures amid the leviathans quickly lose their luster. Rylance is the exception making the big friendly giant cheeky and wistful while gallivanting around London and spewing malapropisms only Dahl could concoct. The estimable British actor makes the lumbering creature seem quite human and we neednt be fluent in gobblefunk to enjoy the jokes about ""human beans"" (people) and ""whizzpopping"" (flatulence). Spielberg does work his magic with several enchanting surreal fantasies where BFG catches wild dreams and then releases them into the ears of unsuspecting sleepers. The big guy is particularly sensitive to the sounds of lonely hearts.Still its hard not to wish for more danger and complexity here like the chilling threats faced by E.T. elements that would heighten the sense of suspense in this movie. Behemoth cannibals like Fleshlumpeater and his cronies -- Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) Bonecruncher and Meatdripper -- should be scarier. There might also have been something menacing about Sophies boarding school.Despite Rylances gentleness and humor theres not enough fun in this fantasy until Her Majesty makes an appearance. Penelope Wilton is wonderfully waggish as the Queen Mum who confronts the colossus traipsing through her garden. Theres also an over-the-top homage to potty humor that would make an Oompa Loompa blush. For all its technical marvels this bedtime story may be lovely to look at but its far too sluggish to keep the short-attention-span generation from nodding off.Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

Which lands it squarely in both the Disney and Steven Spielberg (""E.T."") wheelhouse. Based on the late great Roald Dahls 1982 megabestseller (more than 37 million copies sold and counting) the film follows an orphan and a Big Friendly Giant and is fun and likable occasionally even delightful. Melissa Mathisons screenplay preserves the books wit weirdness and darker undercurrents. (Got enemies? Call the Queen) But at nearly two hours ""BFG"" is ultimately too B-I-G for its own good. The simple story feels padded. Kids may eat it all up but adults may get ants in their pants. They may also wish for a moment as memorable as Elliot and E.T.s airborne bike ride or as touching as the extraterrestrials immortal line ""Ill be right here."" But no. This latest adventure is more matter-of-fact than magical. BFG whisks 10-year-old Sophie off on the adventure of a lifetime. (Disney) In London lonely Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) unwittingly catches the eye of the BFG (Mark Rylance) a towering ogre with billboard-sized ears. He looks terrifying. Especially when he whisks her off to Giant Country. But BFG is nice and unlike others of his ilk doesnt eat kids. In a flashy visual effect he mixes and bottles dreams that he blows into snoozers bedrooms. When mean ogres spoil the fun Sophie comes up with a royal remedy. Finding Dory tops Independence Day at box office At its best ""The BFG"" captures genuine warmth between two ""beans"" as the titular giant would say with nothing in common. The Queen (Penelope Wilton with purse) is enlisted by Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) to remedy a deadly giant situation. (Doane Gregory/Disney) Barnhill a newcomer is a find. Rylance (an Oscar winner for ""Bridge of Spies"") is a plus-sized charmer as the big-hearted BFG who takes Sophie on an adventure shell never forget. If only the movie was as transporting.

There Runt is bullied by nine even bigger giants child-eating cannibals who mock him for being a vegetarian and try to hunt Sophie whom he valiantly defends. Meanwhile Runt plies his gentle trade as the worlds dream-catcher and dream-brewer. The early scenes offer a sort of magic realism in which Runt struggles with the practical details of the modern city with a cleverly grounded whimsy that the movies far more fanciful later conceits cant match for simple astonishment. Rylance brings an arch literary rusticity to Runts brilliantly bungled language and the gifted Barnhill isnt given much with the role of Sophie whos written to be spunky endearing and blank.

Lanky long-limbed and five stories tall this gentle behemoth with jug-ears and a vocabulary of gibberish malapropisms is the main reason to see this sweet kiddie fantasia. It certainly isnt for the meandering story. Based on one of Roald Dahls lesser childrens books The BFG doesnt share the twisted subversive sensibility of the authors Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Its an innocuous bedtime tale about a young girl (played by 12-year-old Ruby Barnhill) whos swiped from her orphanage by the BFG late one night and whisked off to his homeland where she discovers a world of strange wonders and learns not to judge a book by its imposing cover. Parents looking for a 21st-century E.T. to share with their kids are bound to be a bit disappointed even as their eyes are dazzled.

Hes won two directing Academy Awards for films about the Holocaust and World War II and hes made movies about other decidedly adult subjects such as Abraham Lincolns campaign for a 13th Amendment and the Israeli governments efforts to avenge the Munich Olympics murders.That the man once commonly referred to as Hollywoods ""boy wonder"" has shown a propensity for these and other serious topics -- to great success in movies from ""Schindlers List"" to last years ""Bridge of Spies"" -- can have the effect of making a film like ""The BFG"" seem to be yesterdays news. Surely one might assume this titan of his industry and accomplished multi-tasker has better things to do than adapt a 1982 Roald Dahl childrens book about the friendship between a young orphaned London girl and the friendly giant that snatches her away after she sees him sneaking through the streets late one night.Yet the movie plays with an unexpected sense of urgency. It stresses exactly why Spielberg remains in a realm of his own when it comes to filmmaking for families and stands out because it offers a more authentic form of nostalgia than the big-screen norm. Nostalgia of course is in these days. Most of the big tentpole movies during this and well every recent summer are either sequels or remakes with 2016 witnessing everything from a new ""Independence Day"" to the modern take on ""Ben Hur"" that nobody wanted and a parade of superhero movies to add to the increasing glut. While there are plenty of worthwhile entertainments in this group and movies like the upcoming all-women ""Ghostbusters"" that actually find a higher purpose for existing as a general rule they misconstrue fidelity to source material and a series of in-jokes and otherwise sly references with genuine nostalgic spirit.In this world ""The BFG"" is an anomaly a movie that would be all but inconceivable were it not for Spielbergs filmmaking skills and behind-the-scenes clout. Dahls book has not permeated the public consciousness in the fashion of his ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" ""Matilda"" or ""James and the Giant Peach."" The narrative is subdued and quiet compared to the macabre delights of gluttonous children being consumed in a candy wonderland or a telekinetic child getting revenge on an oppressive teacher or the surreal milieu of the inside of a gigantic peach. It doesnt lend itself to the sort of flashy pizzazz the slam-bang moments ideal for a trailer or a sizzle reel.In some respects the movie is quite literally a relic from another time. Its a film project Spielbergs longtime producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy had developed for more than two decades before it finally went into production and its script comes from the late Melissa Mathison who also wrote the filmmakers iconic ""E.T."" and understood how to craft engaging family-friendly screenplays and three-dimensional children characters as well as any of her peers though her previous film was Martin Scorseses ""Kundun"" in 1997.The collective effect is to be freed from the tyranny of the 21st century franchise; box office expectations are not particularly high and theres little chance well ever see a second ""BFG."" The movie therefore resists any pressures of modernization. It is a fairytale in every sense of the word without any discernible opportunity for that most fundamental family movie component one especially perfected by Disney the movies distributor product placement and endless commercial spinoffs.It remains steadfastly faithful to the spirit of Dahls work and to themes that have pre-occupied Spielberg throughout his career loneliness the sacredness of friendship the intersection of the magical and ordinary worlds. The familiar tropes extend to the iconic ""Spielberg Face"" a close-up on a character in wordless awe as her or she considers the magnitude of whats being witnessed be it a collection of dinosaurs the arrival of aliens or in this case the super-sized universe of the land of the giants. Spielberg focuses less on the plot than the mood and the atmosphere of the piece utilizing advanced technological tools to warp the perspective of regular-sized Sophie (Rudy Barnhill) as she is brought to this otherworldly milieu and to transport the audience to the wondrous universe of the creatures with its lush landscapes and swirling supernova bursts of light that are the movies representation of dreams which the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) is tasked with capturing. You Might Also Like Make no mistake This is a commercially-oriented movie with cutting edge CGI and performance-capture effects made by a man who has built a brand worth a reported 3.6 billion that obviously transcends his work as a director. Spielberg in the fashion of his longtime friend George Lucas has skillfully diversified his interests and amply cashed in on all the off-screen financial possibilities allowed by his level of sustained success. But while Lucas appears to have settled happily into a life of semi-retirement forever talking about making ""personal films""  without actually doing them Spielberg chugs along at a considerable pace. When picking movie projects to direct ""I look for things that will scare me"" he recently told The New York Times. ""Fear is my fuel.""Thats a radical notion for a filmmaker working on this scale even one at the top of his field and impervious to the sort of career-crippling failure that typically drives what projects are made in Hollywood. In the interview Spielberg appeared to have been referring to the technical challenge of mounting the project which involved elaborate set-ups to allow newcomer Barnhill to consistently work opposite Rylance rather than an empty screen while achieving enough of a technological advance in performance-capture technology to retain as much of the Oscar winning actors humanity as possible under the CGI mask. But he might as well have been referring to the narrative itself imbued with a humanist streak that links it with ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and especially ""E.T."" and stresses exactly why Spielbergs family movies remain every bit as essential as the films that earned him a new measure of artistic credibility. The movie finds Sophie and the BFG developing a close and gentle bond after an initially hostile beginning one characterized by their shared propensity for nonsense language and powerfully communicated in the movies centerpiece sequences in which the BFG aggressively protects Sophie from his cannibalistic counterparts.Spielberg and Mathison treat Sophie seriously without the condescension that typically characterizes movies about children. They maintain a high regard for the honesty and earnestness of a young girl who grows to love and care for her friend no matter how big or scary or awkward he might come across and it is that connection that carries each scene forward. Theres no higher motivation that that. There are not many films imbued with such a total lack of cynicism these days. Much as Elliot and E.T. once bicycled against the moon in the ultimate gesture of friendship and the image that sums up Spielbergs career perhaps more than any other so too does Sophie step into the BFGs large and outstretched hand for a journey directly into their shared heart.

Accounts of raucous mid-film applause on the other hand rarely surface. Ive experienced only a few such spontaneous ovations here over the years during Holy Motors (the out-of-nowhere musical number performed on multiple accordions) Goodbye To Language (when Godard ""breaks"" 3-D by diverging the left- and right-eye images) and Mommy (a relieved reaction to the 11 aspect ratio going widescreen after about 90 claustrophobic minutes). It happened again last night at the press screening for Maren Ades sublime Toni Erdmann (Grade A) which was my most anticipated film of Cannes 16 going in and is now the consensus critical favorite and first plausible Palme DOr contender. Whats more the scene that inspired the applause while a showstopper isnt even the films most memorable and outlandish set-piece. We assumed while clapping and hooting and hollering and whistling that we were witnessing Toni Erdmanns climax. We had no idea.I dont want to describe either of these glorious moments as theyre designed to blindside you. Thats in keeping with the antic disposition of the first character we meet Winfried Conradi (Peter Simonischek) a middle-aged German divorce with a penchant for playing practical jokes. Winfried has one adult daughter Ines (Sandra Huller) who works in Bucharest for a consulting firm and he decides to pay her an impromptu visit after his beloved dog passes away. When his constant gags (even around her colleagues and important clients) prove alienating Winfried agrees to head home and the film shifts its focus to Ines... whos soon being constantly greeted in public by a ""life coach"" named Toni Erdmann whos just her father wearing fake bad teeth and a terrible wig. Unable to expose him in front of her friends and co-workers Ines begrudgingly plays along even upping the ante herself on occasion; their relationship grows ever more dysfunctional even as it seems likely that ""Toni"" is the only thing keeping Ines from throwing herself out the window of her high-rise apartment.As a few wags here have noted Toni Erdmanns basic plot isnt far removed from something you might find in an Adam Sandler movie--Thats My Boy which I havent seen is the film that generally gets cited. Ade certainly isnt afraid to go big and broad when thats appropriate (hence the aforementioned applause) but her general approach is light years removed from Hollywoods tidy redemption fables. The movie runs close to three hours and genuinely needs the extra time; Ade delves into the particulars of Ines job (which sees her constantly struggling to maintain a position of authority among men) and acknowledges the depth of Winfrieds love without pretending that his goofy grand gestures can serve as a magical cure-all for his daughters unhappiness. Theres a moment in which Ines watches ""Toni"" working the floor at a disco her expression clearly registering how much his decision to stick around and try to cheer her up means to her... and whats amazing about this moment is that it happens not near the end as youd expect but with nearly two hours still to go. As in her equally magnificent previous film Everyone Else Ade begins with a fairly simple dynamic and then proceeds to tease out every possible facet taking her characters to truly unexpected places and ending on a note of disarming irresolution. If the jury has any sense shell be hearing more applause when the awards are announced next weekend.Winfried the practical joker would appreciate what Park Chan-wook does with his latest film The Handmaiden (Grade B+) which starts out looking as if itll be a deeply serious (and seriously depressing) tale of a Korean ""comfort woman"" forced to service the occupying Japanese military. After about five minutes of grandiose solemnity Park drops the charade revealing that the titular handmaiden Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) is actually a master thief whos been assigned to persuade a Japanese heiress Hideko (Kim Min-hee) to marry Sook-hees confederate (Ha Jung-woo) who poses as one Count Fujiwara. Things get (even more) complicated when Sook-hee finds herself first empathizing with and then falling for the naive Hideko whos been raised since childhood by a perverted uncle (Kim Jin-woong) and seems much more interested in her new maid than in the Count. (Theres also the whole colonialism element which forced American viewers at Cannes to keep an eye on the color-coded French subtitles yellow for Japanese dialogue white for Korean.) Loosely based on (or ""inspired by"" per the credits) Sarah Waters 2002 novel Fingersmith which was set in Victorian England The Handmaiden gets progressively trashier and more overheated as it goes along serving up multiple plot twists and replaying earlier scenes from a radically different perspective. Divided into three parts it kicks into gear with part two at roughly the halfway point; it also should have ended there as part three (by far the shortest thankfully) extends the narrative to no clear purpose apart from allowing Park to toss in some gratuitous Oldboy-style violence. That material feels stale especially when compared to The Handmaidens ardently feminist overtones (and fairly explicit lesbian sex scenes).Of course if you really want to be a full-fledged 21st-century movie its best to focus less on actors in favor of motion-captured fully digital (and endlessly manipulable) creations. Steven Spielbergs The BFG (Grade The BMINUS) for example which premiered here today (out of Competition) in advance of its forthcoming July release is such a technological marvel that I had trouble looking past that to see the actual movie. Not having read Roald Dahls 1982 childrens book I cant say how faithful this adaptation is (though colleagues have suggested that darker aspects have been watered down) but it seems to follow the same basic trajectory Cute British orphan Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill) gets abducted by the title character (played or performance-captured by recent Oscar winner Mark Rylance) who turns out to be the smallest and kindest inhabitant of Giant Country; Sophie winds up enlisting the Queen (Penelope Wilton) in an effort to stop the other meaner giants (led by a performance-captured Jemaine Clement) from eating Englands children. Spielberg clearly relished the opportunity to play around with scale zipping his camera in and around various Sophie-dwarfing props and figures. Like The Adventures Of Tintin though The BFG exhausted me more than delighted me--partly because I was constantly conscious of how difficult it must have been to choreograph and execute shots partly because Barnhill belongs to the Hayley Mills tradition of ""spunky"" child actors who only vaguely resemble actual little kids. Rylance whose fine features have been expertly distorted makes an endearingly gentle giant and the movie finally comes alive toward the end when the BFG pays a visit to Buckingham Palace and has to interact with the Queen and her retinue. The more it insists on the importance of magic and dreams however the less magical and dreamlike it seems. Tomorrow Shia LaBoeuf stars in Andrea Arnolds American Honey which means that the only possible evaluative question will be How much of its two hours and 42 minutes (there are a lot of really long movies at Cannes this year) might he have slept through during AllMyMovies?

Occasionally theres a nasty misfire like 1997s too-sadistic The Lost World Jurassic Park. Other examples of fantastical Spielbergiana like Minority Report and A.I. Artificial Intelligence are patchily imaginative but undone by excessive moralism. But with The BFG--which opens in July in the United States and which is playing out of competition here in Cannes--Spielberg gets the tone just right. An adaptation of Roald Dahls 1982 childrens book about a giant--a Big Friendly one that is--who befriends a little orphan girl The BFG is a big picture all right. This ambitious blend of live action and computer animation runs the risk of being overwhelming and sterile but it turns out to be a pleasing and sweet-natured adventure thanks in large part to Spielbergs big friendly secret weapon Mark Rylance as the BFG himself. All of Dahls work is marked by a pleasurable nastiness as well as delight in disorderly behavior. Though Spielberg and screenwriter Melissa Mathison--with the permission of the authors estate--have somewhat expanded and changed Dahls story The BFG honors the authors whimsical waggishness impropriety. (This is the final screenplay from Mathison the screenwriter of E.T. The Extraterrestrial who died in November 2015.) The heroine of the story is young Sophie (played by Ruby Barnhill whos spikily precocious without being overly cute) a London orphan whose intelligence and imagination are stoked by the books she loves to read. One night Sophie is plucked from the orphanage by a giant hand and whisked away to a place she doesnt realize. When shes plunked into a frying pan she fears shell soon become something or someones dinner. As it turns out shed been kidnaped in a kindly sort of way by a vegetarian giant who means no harm This gangly skyscraper-tall fellow with knobby knees and elbows and ears that flare out like sugarbowl handles is the Big Friendly Giant (a computer-enhanced but instantly recognizable Rylance) and Sophie after she overcomes her fear of him shortens his name to BFG for conveniences sake. The BFG explains to Sophie that shes now in Giant Country though because he jumbles and mangles his words and hasnt had a lick of schooling he pronounces ""giant"" like ""joint."" (Even he acknowledges his mastery of the English language is ""a bit crumply."") Sophie learns all about his solitary life Hes the smallest of the giants in Giant Country and the others gargantuan booming individuals with terrible manners bully him incessantly. (Bill Hader and Jemaine Clement supply the voices for two of them.) They also insist on a diet of ""human beans"" while the BFG subsists on bumpy slimy foul-smelling cucumberlike vegetable known as a snozzcumber. The BFG is also a giant with a big job He captures dreams and seals them in glass jars--where they glow in translucent jellybean colors--before using a massive trumpet to blow them into the minds of humans as they sleep. Sophie accompanies the BFG on his dream-catching rounds where she witnesses the other giants mistreatment of him. She hatches a plan to stop them from harassing the BFG and to end their diet of human protein by enlisting the help of the Queen (Penelope Wilton). Its sensibly ridiculous as solutions go and Spielberg takes clear pleasure in it The sequence in which the BFG visits Buckingham Palace and introduces the queen--not to mention her corgis--to his favorite drink a fizzy flatulence-inducing libation called frobscottle is joyously chaotic without being overwhelming. For such a big extravagant movie with such an outsized central character The BFG is surprisingly intimate and thats largely thanks to Rylance His BFG is a fragile gentle soul with clumsy feet clad in hippie-sandals a bit frightening at first but he wins us over in a heartbeat. His higglety-pigglety cadences and incessant malapropisms--""butterflies"" become ""buttery-flies"" for example--come to sound like music and his eyes are sad and warm and exuberant at once. Hes a giant too big for the world and yet fully alive to it. At one point he reads Sophie to sleep with a snippet from her copy of Nicholas Nickleby holding the tiny book in his hands as if it were a grand miniature treasure. He needs a magnifying glass to see the minuscule type but as he reads aloud the words come out in great rolling waves. Even for giants God is in the details. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Entertainment ""The BFG"" Is A Softer Version Of Roald Dahls Dark Strange Book But then again when are movies ever as dark or as weird as the Roald Dahl originals? Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > The BFG. Disney ID 8658596 Roald Dahls novels have sharp edges that tend to get filed away when theyre made into movies seemingly out of a misguided idea that children cant handle a little darkness.On the pages of James and the Giant Peach for instance Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker get squashed to death by the titular peach as it rolls down the hill toward the sea; the main character in The Witches is never turned from a mouse back into a boy; and in The BFG the title characters brethren go out every night and snatch people out of their beds to eat them. But thats largely (heh) abstracted from Steven Spielbergs new adaptation of Dahls 1982 childrens book.Dahls BFG isnt just clear about the people-eating its filled with irresistibly groanworthy gags about how the natives of various countries taste -- Turks are reminiscent of turkey Swedes have a ""Sweden sour taste"" and everyone from Greece is safe on account of their greasy flavor. Spielbergs movie vaguely suggests the whole human-hunting thing is a recent development for giants and arranges for the bulk of them to ultimately regret their ""cannybull"" ways. (Honest question If a giants clearly not human is that accusation fair?)The Big Friendly Giant of the movie is as he is in the book the veggie-munching malapropism-prone runt of a group of man-gobbling giants. Hes played with a twinkle and motion capture technology by Bridge of Spies star Mark Rylance and hes an overall softer less odd easier to take version of the towering character than the unpredictable shouty one in the book who feels more like an unstable but kindhearted uncle. He still swivels his big ears this BFG but Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) the plucky orphan he snatches when she spots him and whom he quickly befriends doesnt do any riding in them. View this image > Barnhill as Sophie. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures ID 8660004 The result is a movie thats comfortable but also as soporific as a warm stuffy room. The BFG isnt a book in which all that much happens to begin with and whittling away some of the weirder and grimmer bits means more time to have to fill with awe. Spielberg whisks some lovely images together to portray the land of the giants including the den hidden behind a waterfall that the BFG has filled with dreams in bottles like multicolored fireflies and the way his oversized comrades (played by Bill Hader and Jemaine Clement among others) use grassy sod as their blankets. But the movie presumes a sense of wonder more often than it actually generates one from Sophies trip with the BFG to Dream Country to the implementation of the pairs plan to enlist the help of the queen (Penelope Wilton entertainingly proper in the face of a surprising visitor) to get rid of the other giants.The BFG was written by Melissa Mathison who died last year and who wrote the screenplay for Spielbergs E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial one of the greatest childrens movies of all time. In the relationship between Sophie and the BFG there are echoes of Elliotts friendship with E.T. but theres little of the emotional depth. The movies got more in common with Spielbergs most recent The Adventures of Tintin in which the technology also dazzled and the end result also felt a bit hollow.The BFG creates a cozy 80s England a sun-dappled giants otherworld and a looming lovable goliath with the expressiveness of a recent Oscar winner and yet it lacks the soul of Quentin Blakes simple charmingly squiggly original drawings. Sharp edges may not be safe but they prevent something from slipping through the fingers the way The BFG does as soon as its over.

But now for the not-so-great news...The idea of a Steven Spielberg film appearing at this festival might strike some as strange but the director has a real history with Cannes. He won a Best Screenplay prize here for The Sugarland Express back in 1974 and E.T. premiered here in 1982. (More recently Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had its world premiere in 2008.) And in some ways The BFG adapted from Roald Dahls beloved childrens story and due to be released later this summer by Disney has some relevance to the other films playing here what with its themes of pursuing your dreams (American Honey Staying Vertical Paterson) and the consequences of growing up (Toni Erdmann Cafe Society) and countering the sorrows of the world with imagination and freedom and whatnot.Film Details The BFG RatingPG GenreFamily Running Time117 min. Showing Today In1 Theater More Info Trailer EXPAND Courtesy Cannes Film Festival Related StoriesCannes Goods Personal Shopper Julieta Aquarius and Hell or High WaterIm told that Spielbergs film is quite faithful to Dahls original about a young orphan (Ruby Barnhill) who is abducted by a giant (Mark Rylance) and taken away to a magic land where she discovers that hes the sole friendly member of a race of giants -- a kind and melancholy soul at the mercy of his bigger man-eating brethren. I havent read the book so those who adore it and are horrified at the idea of anyone changing a word may well enjoy Spielbergs heartfelt respectful version. But the film suffers from the one thing that Spielberg films almost never suffer from -- stasis. Hes made essentially a ""hangout"" movie one in which were supposed to luxuriate among the characters but Spielberg isnt a director who thrives in that kind of environment. You can sense his restlessness too. Hes fascinated as always by objects -- by the giants Rube Goldberg-like inventions and contraptions and the creaky colorful ornaments and potions in his little cave of wonders where the film spends much of its first act. But when it comes to actual interactions between girl and giant the energy dissipates. (This is also why all those scenes with the Lost Boys fall flat in Hook.) These types of movies need some sort of spontaneity but thats not generally Spielbergs thing -- though he can sometimes surprise you as with the boat bonding sequences in Jaws. EXPAND Courtesy Cannes Film Festival The film theoretically picks up when it moves on to Buckingham Palace and to an audience with the Queen where we get some decent laughs -- particularly in a big set piece involving the giant having breakfast with the queens retinue a scene punctuated by a series of massive farts (all straight out of Dahl Im told). But while Spielberg is an expert at offhand humor -- throwaway lines background slapstick deadpan undercutting of suspense -- hes on less-secure footing with big comic sequences. He treats them like action scenes Theyre all build anticipation and climax with little room left for unpredictability charm or freedom. Kids may well dig it. (Hell my kid may well dig it.) But for me The BFG was all anticipation of a different kind leading to a massive letdown.

Daily Edition Login to download The BFG Cannes Review 704 AM PDT 5/14/2016 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A thematic but not creative match of E.T. TWITTER 7/1/2016 Steven Spielberg dips into a deep bag of technological tricks to put humans and giants on the same screen in his adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic. An uncanny thematic mirror to E.T. some 34 years later Steven Spielberg and Melissa Mathisons The BFG emerges as a conspicuously less captivating magical and transporting experience than its classic forebear. Quite literally about the value and importance of dreams to the exclusion of almost anything else this adaptation of Roald Dahls enduring classic (published coincidentally the same year E.T. came out) sees the director diving deep into a technological bag of tricks to mix giants and humans on the same cinematic stage.  Big commercial results loom for Disneys major early July release but the two-hour two-hander drags with too much dialogue during the first half and never truly achieves narrative lift-off. Another addition to the helmers substantial shelf of heavily Anglophile works The BFG short for The Big Friendly Giant explicitly enunciates its concerns as much as it dramatizes them; it is the self-cultivated profession of the solitary title character played by the filmmakers new favorite actor the brilliant stage dynamo Mark Rylance to collect and store dreams in glowing bottles kept in his elaborate underground cave. Dahls source material seems an almost too-perfect fit for the director in that it centers on a child in this case Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) whose only solace in her orphanage-bound life is reading. Unlike in E.T. which was also written by the late Mathison the obviousness of the new films concerns are not accompanied by other characters or interests leaving everything out on the surface. This is a movie devoid of layers and subtext. The simple plot has the BFG -- a several stories-tall middle-aged bloke who is quite thin and has swept-back graying hair a conspicuously large nose and nearly Dumbo-like ears -- kidnapping little Sophie one night when she spots him in central London; this cannot be tolerated as if word gets out among ordinary humans that giants exist it will mean the end of them. The big guy spirits the bespectacled rational little girl off to his remote cave; fortunately for her he turns out to be a loner among giants a gentle considerate soul prone to some original forms of speech. Far more importantly hes not a carnivore or a cannibal as are his much larger fellow giants who roam the wilds nearby. A fair amount of the would-be comedy involves the fearsome mountain dwellers who look not to have descended far beyond Neanderthal status (and curiously are all males) being fooled by the BFG as they pick up the girls scent in the vicinity but cant find her. Spielberg has opted to eliminate Dahls depiction of the lumbering big guys actually hunting down humans and eating them thereby making them into relative buffoons; despite opportunities the director has avoided anything remotely scary or even frankly surprising which was certainly not the case in E.T. The long scenes set in the BFGs cave which is outfitted to resemble the domain of a late 19th century academic or scientist are heavily talky made to seem moreso due to a clear decision to have Rylance deliver his lines slowly. A different performer and certainly most comic ones would have attacked Dahls goofy invented words -- stuff like ""slogroggled"" and ""splitzwiggled"" and ""fluckgungled"" and so on -- with rapid-fire relish. Rylance who has entered the most rarified realms of comedy onstage and can channel greats like Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel at will takes things more slowly here rolling some of the words around in his mouth and altogether trying to create a fully rounded character out of a childrens book invention. Its a novel admirable approach but as so fully indulged by the director it tends to weigh the enterprise down just when it needs more zip and momentum. For her part the brown-haired brown-eyed Barnhill is direct and well-spoken but also is as literal-minded as the film; she does her business but her personality doesnt leap off the screen. Eventually things pick up a bit in the final act which is mostly set in the Queens quarters at Buckingham Palace where the plot devised by the BFG and Sophie to do in the bad giants must originate. Penelope Wiltons performance as the monarch is defiantly not a Helen Mirren-like attempt to impersonate the actual Queen Elizabeth II although a little joke is had in having her call the White House and ask Nancy to put Ronnie on (another detail connecting the film to the 1980s). A climactic helicopter raid gives Spielberg a brief chance to exercise his action chops but the sequence feels surprisingly perfunctory in the filmmakers overall scheme of things not designed to create the usual thrills. Rather the movie represents the director in a more pensive even philosophical vein less interested in propulsive cinema and more reflective about what would seem to mean the most to him -- dreams and the ability to make them come true. This is what The BFG is about but unfortunately that is basically all its about and by a considerable measure too explicitly and single-mindedly so.

Lets say for the sake of argument that giants really exist. That they galumph around London round about the witching hour plucking kids from orphanage windows as a late-night snack. That one among them has misgivings about all this ""cannybullism"" and might actually make a pretty good friend if given the chance. Wouldnt you like to know about it? Thats the beauty of Roald Dahls ""The BFG"" as brought to life by recent Oscar winner Mark Rylance You believe. No matter how fantastical the tale (and it gets pretty out-there at points) this splendid Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation makes it possible for audiences of all ages to wrap their heads around one of the unlikeliest friendships in cinema history resulting in the sort of instant family classic ""human beans"" once relied upon Disney to deliver.SEE MORE Cannes Film Festival Dahls widely read and nearly universally revered novel began its journey to becoming a Spielberg movie some 25 years ago at roughly the same time the director released one of his few duds the cacophony that was 1991s garish Peter Pan rehash ""Hook."" That film served up more bad ideas than good but among its takeaway lessons was the notion that magic only works so long as children believe and here we see the principle put into practice. Though waiting more than a couple of decades meant losing out on the idea of casting Robin Williams as the eponymous ""Big Friendly Giant"" (a choice that would have altered the films chemistry entirely) its just as well that Spielberg waited for technology has finally caught up to the projects ambition allowing Rylance to credibly become a 24-foot-tall ""runt"" -- the smallest (by far) in a race of performance-capture giants. ""The BFG"" is gonna be huge. That much practically goes without saying With Spielberg at the helm ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" screenwriter Melissa Mathison at the typewriter (though she died last November) and Dahls wonderful imagination -- and vocabulary -- at the fore the film has ginormous box office potential. Still without any bona-fide movie stars or franchise characters to drive worldwide audiences desire to see it ""The BFG"" wont have an easy time getting anywhere near the 20 highest-grossing films of all time (a list where Spielberg presently holds last place with ""Jurassic Park""). Fortunately ""The BFG"" bears far more in common with ""E.T."" than ""Hook"" representing yet another opportunity for a misunderstood young person -- in this case parentless 10-year-old Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill) whos whisked from her orphanage window and spirited off to Giant Country -- to connect with a creature whom her fellow human beings simply wouldnt understand. For a certain generation ""E.T."" will always stand as the ultimate childrens movie and while it certainly belongs in the pantheon there has always been something deeply unsettling about the way the story veered from an intergalactic bonding opportunity to a panicky fable about how humans inevitably ruin everything (a flaw that subbing walkie-talkies for guns simply couldnt fix). Here its the nine other giants -- a nasty irritable lot easily twice the BFGs size with names like Fleshlumpeater Bonecruncher and Meatdripper and with teeth the size of tombstones -- who pose a threat gumbling at the idea of fraternizing with their food. (Whether the BFG has adopted Sophie as his pet or vice versa is a matter open to debate though either way its a charming idea for kids.) The BFG may have adopted a more enlightened diet subsisting entirely on a stinky vegetable called Snozzcumbers that make lima beans sound downright delicious but the rest still prefer a nice human delicacy. And just as sensitive as the BFGs big ears are to sounds so too is the mammoth schnozz of giant leader Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) to the odors of a potential human treat. But Sophie isnt easily intimidated and fortunately her courage is infectious in what might otherwise have been a film far too frightening for anyone Sophies age or younger. The BFG hadnt exactly planned what to do with Sophie after snatching her from the orphanage although anticipating the sort of reaction that befell E.T. (where frightened humans might capture him and put him in a zoo) its clear that he cant leave her to go spilling about the existence of giants on ""the tellytelly bunkum box and the radio squeaker."" Spielberg withholds a proper introduction till the pair get to Giant Country but endears us to the character straightaway by revealing the conspicuous creatures ability to hide in plain sight as the BFG uses his best nighttime ninja moves to evade detection in London. While the other giants have been designed largely from scratch (and as such look somewhat more convincing to the eye) with the BFG theres an undeniably resemblance to Rylance. If anything his features have merely been distorted to suit his new dimensions as tall as a soccer goal is wide with hands the size of grocery pallets huge elephant-scale ears and a nose that would be right at home on Mount Rushmore. As appealingly sensitive as Rylances features may be this funhouse-mirror reconfiguration takes some adjustment on our part throwing off some of the forced-perspective gags in the early getting-to-know-you scenes back at his cave -- which looks not altogether different from certain Hobbit sets imagined by his ""The Adventures of Tintin"" collaborator Peter Jackson. Jackson also introduced Spielberg to the technology that made ""The BFG"" possible and its thanks to Joe Letteri and the WETA performance capture team that Rylance -- a character actor whose impact often relies on his ability to under-play any given role -- succeeds in imbuing his digital avatar with subtlety and nuance (the total opposite of what Williams likely would have brought to the part). With no offense intended to mo-cap pioneer Andy Serkis its exciting to see someone else driving one of these virtual performances although without Williams in the role theres no telling how many laughs were lost along the way. What humor ""The BFG"" does offer derives almost directly from Dahls novel most of it owing to the giants ""squiggly"" way of speaking in a dialect known as ""gobblefunk."" Meanwhile Mathisons script excels more at deepening the connection between Sophie and the BFG than at cracking jokes along the way. If anything she seems to be toning down some of Dahls more outrageous gags including a scene in which Buckingham Palace erupts in a round of ""whizzpoppers"" (one can only imagine how Eddie Murphy or Mike Myers might have taken this flatulent set piece in another direction). But she has also invented the films single best scene elaborating on the fact that the BFG tries to compensate for the other giants human-gobbling antics by blowing pleasant dreams through the windows of sleeping children. At Sophies insistence the BFG takes the girl along on a dream-gathering expedition hopping through a magical pool to Dream Country an upside-down world where ""phizzwizards"" -- literally the stuff that dreams are made of -- circle the branches of a giant tree like Apples mesmerizing ""Flurry"" screensaver. Together girl and giant chase these phosphorescent blurs around like so many elusive butterflies. Aesthetically speaking its a downright hypnotic sequence giving longtime Spielberg collaborator John Williams the richest moment to heighten via a fully orchestral score that manages to enchant without relying so heavily as usual on a simple recurring musical theme. Those who know Dahls book understand how vital dreams are to resolving the storys giant-human detente and this hypnotic ""dream sequence"" -- alongside a couple other scenes set in the BFGs dream-mixing workshop -- makes Sophies fanciful solution feel nearly as plausible as the idea that shes befriended the planets only benevolent giant. The finale which brings the BFG face-to-face with the Queen of England finds Spielberg stepping out of his comfort zone into the realm of farce and though adults will find this section to be royally silly its a vast improvement on similar scenes in ""Minions"" and ""Garfield A Tale of Two Kitties."" These are hardly the comparisons Spielberg might be aiming for with what is clearly designed to be a late-career classic though enlisting the Queens assistance is about as far as one can get from the problematic last act of ""E.T."" -- which is not to say that watching Her Majesty rip ""whizzpoppers"" is necessarily a better solution. By this point in their collaboration Spielberg and d.p. Janusz Kaminski have arrived at lighting and framing their footage in such a way that it feels downright authoritative as if no better vantage could be had on the moment in question. Here that quality allows Barnhill (who looks like a less-precious version of ""Matilda"" star Mara Wilson) and the virtual Rylance to convincingly coexist especially on the gorgeous emerald-green steppes of Giant Country where Spielberg invites us to believe our eyes.

Reply The BFG says July 11 2016 at 221 am I remember reading this in 5th Grade. Actually the teacher read it to us; but it felt like a requirement. Naturally I grew to love it. (Chris Hader voices one of the giants amp; the guy who played the Russian spy from Bridge of Spies will be voicing the BFG.) Reply Adam Zanzie says July 3 2016 at 345 am Good review Mr. Debruge -- although I too dont understand why you damn ""E.T."" with faint praise by labeling it ""unsettling"" ""problematic"" and a film ""about how humans ruin everything"". Thats not what ""E.T."" was about. How long has it been since you last watched it? The film was not about how humans ""ruin everything"" but about how humans at their very best can band together to accomplish great things. Elliot his siblings and his friends work hard to get E.T. home. Mary Gradually becomes supportive of her sons efforts. And even Keys (the Peter Coyote character) turns out to be not a villain at all but a warm father figure delighted by Elliots discovery of this alien and confessing to him ""Im glad he found you first."" Watch that movie again. Its not at all about ""how humans ruin everything"". More than just a good movie for children it was one of the best movies ever made. Reply John says June 29 2016 at 1058 am When adjusting for inflation Spielberg has 3 movies in the Top 20. E.T. Jaws and Jurassic Park. Reply Steve says May 15 2016 at 743 pm ""E.T. will always stand as the ultimate childrens movie and while it certainly belongs in the pantheon there has always been something deeply unsettling about the way the story veered from an intergalactic bonding opportunity to a panicky fable about how humans inevitably ruin everything."" E.T. was not a ""childrens movie"" in the sense that term is usually meant. It was about aspects of childhood that could be identified by children and adults. And for me to think that it turned into a ""panicky fable about how humans inevitably ruin everything"" is to so severely miss the most important ideas and feelings I saw the film trying to convey that I am not even sure we saw the same film... Reply Alex says May 15 2016 at 521 am Are there any black people or homosexuals in it? Did the women make less money then the men? Reply kenjimoto says June 18 2016 at 320 pm Thanks for sharing you abject loneliness with us. Doesnt look like that will be changing anytime soon though does it? Reply macd says May 14 2016 at 257 pm In other words Uncle Stevie has made a childrens film about cannibalism. Five years ago Uncle Marty made a kiddie movie about film preservation. ""The BFG"" will be this years ""Hugo"" respectful reviews empty theaters. Reply EricJ says May 14 2016 at 316 pm Hugo was about film preservation but because Spielberg went out and made-ick-a MOTION CAPTURE CGI about Tintin the same month our boiling Robert Zemeckis hate finally went nuclear and we started railing against any ""big director"" who went out and made ""kiddie films"" unquote. Never mind all the Scorsese ""Where are the gangsters?"" jokes ask an audience who hadnt seen Hugo and theyd say ""No I dont like CGI films.""(sic) Thats where our heads were back then. As it is good Roald Dahl films are hard to come by (the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka is the closest thing we have to true Dahl on film and Dahl hated it with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang a close second and it wasnt even his book) but Ill trust Spielberg with having read enough of them. Reply Mark says May 14 2016 at 1222 pm Nice to see yet another animated cartoon in the theaters. Reply Rudy Mario says May 14 2016 at 1141 am Interesting review. Other reviews of this movie from Cannes are mostly negative. I found the last two films of Spielberg very boring. Hope he is back to his old mastery of making interesting and entertaining movies. Reply me says May 14 2016 at 143 pm Only boring people get bored. Reply B. says May 15 2016 at 421 pm The BFG was soooo good Nobody should take what any of those pretentious people from Cannes have to say. They only praise movies that bore ppl amp; play themselves up as intellectually elite so that ppl are scared to disagree with them. Like that Godard film last year. What a joke. Movies are made for people to watch. If nobody wants to watch your movie then thats not a sign of you being better than commercial filmmakers-its a sign of why you failed in life. Bye Rudy Mario says May 15 2016 at 1009 am ...and inbred losers can not handle difference of opinions and tastes... David says May 14 2016 at 919 am 1991 was 25 years ago not 15. TWO and half decades not a decade and a half. ) Reply inderweltsein says May 14 2016 at 907 am This is only a ""Walt Disney Studios release of a Disney ... presentation"" in North America.. For example in Cannes (and France) (and I guess the writer knows it) this is a handled by Metropolitan FilmExport. In the past for festival reviews both the local distributor the international seller and the US distributor were named by Variety if I am not mistaken. Not anymore. Why.. Reply Doc Michaels says May 14 2016 at 834 am Well at least we know Debrugge thinks ET is ""problematic"" and ""unsettling"". Ill take this gushing review with a grain of salt. Reply B. says May 15 2016 at 423 pm ET is one of the greatest movies ever D (Debrugge is obviously just jealous of Spielberg. But to be fair if I was stuck reviewing film instead of making/starring in films Id be depressed too.) Reply Simon says May 14 2016 at 631 am Thats not how it played in Cannes Peter... Reply Michael Klossner says May 14 2016 at 626 am The second paragraph says 1991 was 15 years ago. No it was 25 years ago.

For this movie version aimed squarely at small kids who love the book Steven Spielberg working with the late ET writer Melissa Mathison runs with the lean meat of Dahls tale. Mark Rylance is the benevolent giant who pours dreams and nightmares into the ears of sleeping humans and who joins forces with the Queen (Penelope Wilton) to put a stop to the threat of flesh-eating giants. Spielberg makes surprisingly few embellishments to Dahls story yet he tones down some of the more vicious bone-crunching and is more interested in the wonder of dreams than the terror of nightmares. This is a faithful charming (if a tiny bit sluggish) version that mixes live action with the same motion-capture technique that Spielberg used for The Adventures of Tintin in 2011. There are a handful of heart-stopping moments not least when Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is snatched from her bed by those enormous fingers coming through the window. But there are points too when you can see the technology working which might leave you wondering if digital invention can ever really match the imaginative leaps inspired by the printed word. Still the giant that Spielberg has created with actor Mark Rylance is testament to how fast this technology is moving hes a fleshy marvel full of personality flaws and life. And yes he does indeed look very very friendly. You also fully believe the BFGs friendship with the little girl Sophie played by Ruby Barnhill who early in the film threatens to be annoyingly bossy and stampy but whose performance gives way to something more sweet and vulnerable - steering well clear of cute. Spielberg more or less keeps the 1980s setting (Reagan is President although worryingly a mysterious politician called Boris is on the other end of the phone to the Queen). The story plays like a reverse of ET (here its the little girl who must return home fleeing a hostile land). And Spielberg nods to his earlier movie with a striking moment when the BFG is silhouetted against a blazing sun. For all the films strengths its hard to shake the niggling feeling that something is missing. Certainly this slightly mournful The BFG could use more humour (its no Paddington) and perhaps also a more personal spin on Dahls story would have been welcome (its no Fantastic Mr Fox either). But flaws aside this is a superior inventive kids film and one thats bound to make Rylances giant a favourite with younger audiences.

The reverence for this preeminent commercial storyteller goes so deep that his adaptation of Roald Dahls beloved 1982 childrens book arrived at the festival as though it had nothing to prove. And indeed anyone familiar with Dahls original work will find that this faithful treatment of the material merges quite organically with the usual Spielbergian tropes although in this case it feels more like an illustration of preexisting skill than a paragon of its powers. Featuring a plucky child launched on a supernatural adventure laced with dazzling effects and sentimentalism ""The BFG"" is Spielberg by the numbers -- and likely to please viewers looking for just that. But this is a lighter variation of the ""E.T."" formula impressively realized and likable without ever catapulting into more inspired territory. An eager crowdpleaser from one of the worlds greatest crowdpleasers it gets the job done and nothing more. The final screenplay by the late ""E.T."" scribe Melissa Matheson ""The BFG"" takes its cues from the novel by not wasting much time on exposition. The essence of the plot finds little orphan Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill sturdy if unremarkable) who glances out her London window one night and spots the titular giant (Mark Rylance) lurking through the alleys and pilfering dreams from sleeping humans. Intent on keeping his existence a secret the BFG -- thats the Big Friendly Giant for the uninitiated -- nabs Sophie from her bed and takes her back to giant country a distant land where the good-natured dream-catcher cowers in his home adjacent to his much cruder neighbors a group of human-eating ogres eager to uncover the BFGs new friend. It doesnt take long for Sophie to get over her fear of her new captor a transition made somewhat credible by the movies exemplary motion capture effects which contort Rylances face into a wizened benevolent creature. While the bright colors initially make the special effects seem cartoonish this approach is befitting of the movies storybook tone. Gone are the days of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" when Spielberg dared to render the kidnapping of a child in the dead of the night by otherworldly beings into the terrifying phenomenon one would expect. Instead ""The BFG"" radiates warmth early on establishing Rylances character as a chatty big-hearted loner whose uneducated dialect (""wiglish"" as he calls it) only adds to his charm. There is some modicum of suspense to the arrival of the BFGs carnivorous brethren a snarling group of hairy muscular bullies -- the BFG dubs them ""bean-eaters"" -- amusingly embodied by the likes of Rafe Spall Bill Hader and Jemaine Clement with a kind of devious slapstick. As they team up to bully the BFG a sympathetic Sophie watches from the sidelines and eventually decides to give her new pal a pep talk. Following a wondrous journey back to the city where she witnesses the giants ability to capture the power of dreams she concocts a plan to rescue him from persecution with the help of the queen (Penelope Wilton). And thats all she wrote. ""The BFG"" fills two hours with gorgeous colors and tender exchanges but it never quite launches into the awe-inspiring territory one might expect from a master of cinematic fantasy. Sputtering into comedic territory during its final third as Rebecca Hall surfaces alongside Wilton for an underdeveloped royal strategy session ""The BFG"" falls short of allowing its emotional appeal to reach full bloom. Instead it sags into zany comedy territory with the BFGs awkward interaction with the smaller species leading to underwhelming punchlines. This may be the first Spielberg movie with fart jokes -- which admittedly come straight from the novel. But unlike the recent cosmically-inspired fart joke saga ""Swiss Army Man"" Spielberg doesnt apply this gag to any inspired end point; the comical detour derails the whole story. Despite his command of scale and imagery Spielberg cant seem to uncover the tonal center of the material. Unlike Spike Jonzes ""Where the Wild Things Are"" which tapped into the underlying melancholy driving the childs imaginative vision of menacing beasts ""The BFG"" takes its events at face value and rarely manages to give them much depth. Still there are a number of compelling moments to compensate for the lesser story. Sophies trip with the BFG to dream country which lies beneath a shimmering lake filled with shimmering neon embers has a phantasmagoric quality that elevates the narrative to appropriately magical heights. The digital wizardry contributes to a unique world thats both visibly artificial and hyperreal. These days however impressive effects are such a given -- see the similarly convincing giants of the comparatively DIY Norwegian thriller ""Trollhunter"" -- that ""The BFG"" cant mask its slight touch with digital finesse.
