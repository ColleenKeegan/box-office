Mark Wahlberg is convincingly monomaniacal as Max Payne a rogue cop seeking vengeance for the murder of his wife and child. Fortunately for him Maxs search overlaps with a Russian mobsters search for her strung-out sister Natasha (Bond girl Olga Kurylenko). Unfortunately for them  drug that induces hallucinations of flying demons has turned ex-soldier Jack Lupino (Amaury Nolasco) into a killing machine. Beau Bridges has fun as Maxs mentor now head of security for secretive pharma corporation Aesir.John Moore directs the hell out of the action while Jonathan Selas glistening photography captures the snow and rain that fall on these bloody New York streets. But youd have to be on crack not to guess the surprise finale.

Although the film differs from the original story considerably and several great characters were ignored or only hinted at while others were slotted in from nowhere the films over-all feel was greatly remminiscent of the game. The plot was a bit swiss cheese with many loose ends but the film was certainly worth at least one watch if only for the not-overdone slow-mo action and gritty drug-fuelled fantasy.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 29 2009jordan hardingFeaturedwhen i first played the games i was like wow. theyre probably the best games ever to be released then i saw there was a movie coming out i though great and when i watched it well i was more than impressed although they should have stuck to the games a little more because they went off the story line at some points but over great film and well worth the watch dont listen to those who say this film is rubbish its really notFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 12 2008SimonFeaturedI love Max Payne.

His New York (a transformed Toronto) is a hellhole of back alleys not boulevards; of deserted subway platforms not teeming sidewalks; a place where ashy snow drifts down like endless regrets.In this bleak warren Max Payne stews. Dressed in black and packing a firearm heftier than Dirty Harrys hes the Ahab of the police department. Played with quiet but convincing menace by Mark Wahlberg Max is a dangerous man because he doesnt care if he dies. He has devoted himself to hunting down the killers of his beloved wife and child.A snitch warns him ""Youre chasing ghosts Max."" Actually his foes are far scarier.In pursuing his vendetta he barges into a vast conspiracy involving an addictive experimental serum Norse mythology and ravenous angels of death.His adversary-turned-ally in this murky mystery is the lethal Russian mobstress Mona (a shockingly grown-up and compelling Mila Kunis of That 70s Show).Kunis is not by any means the only primetime immigrant on the screen. Keep your eyes peeled and youll see TV troupers from Prison Break The Wire Heroes and Life.The deep and eclectic cast is one of the most striking things about Max Payne. The film is stacked with names ranging from Beau Bridges and Chris ODonnell to rapper Ludacris (Chris Bridges) and singer Nelly Furtado both in dramatic roles.Thats an impressive crew for a pulp project however stylish.The action scenes in Max Payne are excellent particularly a stunning shootout that exceeds anything since the first Matrix release. (Dont you think Sam Peckinpah is spinning in his grave with jealousy over all the toys that modern directors get to play with?)Unfortunately the film goes off the spool in the final reel as the supernatural elements the weakest part of the story take over completely. Then the film disappointingly resorts to an artificially redemptive conclusion.By the time Mona pleads with Max ""You have to finish this"" you may be shouting the same thing at the screen. Max Payne  (out of four stars) Directed by John Moore. With Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis Beau Bridges and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges.

"In brutal Max Payne villains and filmmakers miss mark - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In brutal Max Payne villains and filmmakers miss mark Mark Wahlberg plays the title character a New York City detective searching for the killer of his wife and baby. (Michael gibson) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / October 17 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + One hesitates to use a term like symbolism in relation to ""Max Payne."" But mustnt it mean something that no one in the movie whos armed (which is just about everyone) seems able to hit the target? ""Max Payne"" is based on a video game of the same name and the only character any good at playing is Max himself.Mark Walhberg sulks relentlessly in the title role a miserable New York City detective and he brings extra-strength solemnity to the part. On the one hand Who killed Maxs wife and baby? On the other Who allowed him to stop dressing like a cop and start dressing like a bouncer at a strip club in Saugus? Black on black on black on black? Dude we get it - youre tough youre depressed youre tired of checking IDs.Max spends his movie trying to find out who murdered his family while being a suspect in a different murder. But its hard for us to be as committed to justice as he is when the search turns so chaotically brutal so often. We are however handed an odd grab bag of actors to sort through. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges snarls as the detective following Max. Kate Burton sits in the back of a Town Car and looks guilty. Poor Chris ODonnell looks foolish while trying to look guilty. Jamie Hector the actor who was so good as Marlo the ambitiously cold-blooded kingpin on ""The Wire"" tries a voodoo accent. And Beau Bridges as a security chief is perfectly unembarrassed even as he appears to be one missed eyebrow trim away from becoming a giant owl.But mostly the movie orbits around Wahlberg. Perhaps he took the part for its fitness value. One sequence requires him to run shoot and leap through the air while shooting. Another requires him to leap then run and shoot. Hes all business here refusing the advances of a sexed-up junkie and ignoring the junkies spiky vampy sister (Mila Kunis) who enters his life after the junkie turns up dead.This is not a movie that has great passion for pleasures of the flesh. Its sexiest scenes involve bullets cutting through the air in the slowest motion possible and the men who cock their shotguns extravagantly leaping backward to fire them. Restaging mayhem from old John Woo movies is all director John Moore cares to do. In his last outing a contemptible remake of ""The Omen"" Moore whipped fake hellhounds into a frenzy and sent Julia Stiles plummeting to her death. This time he gets to show demons with 30-foot wingspans and orchestrate a shootout in a pharmaceuticals office. (Watch the Post-Its fly)Eventually we hear news of a drug that makes our troops invincible (yes that story line again) but the conspiracy goes nowhere. The filmmakers aim their cynicism more at us than at any government or drug company. They seem far more excited about the giant graphically designed gun that stars in the closing credits. It gets a much better close-up than Wahlberg does. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

ABOUT THE MOVIEMax Payne 1/2 (out of four)Stars Mark Wahlberg Beau Bridges Mila Kunis Chris ""Ludacris"" BridgesDirector John MooreDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for violence including intense shooting sequences drug content some sexuality and brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Max Payne couldnt be more appropriately named. Sitting through this stylish-looking but derivative vacuous and bullet-riddled movie inflicts maximum pain. About the only thing it has going for it is the stylized production design and a few cool special effects but the story couldnt be more inane nor the characters less credible. The look -- consistently dark and often snowing -- has a cartoonish quality that brings to mind The Polar Express gone evil. CLIP Dodge bullets with Max Payne Max Payne is a policeman compulsively determined to find out who murdered his wife and baby. Its been three years since the unsolved murders and he was taken off the detective beat and assigned to cold cases. Emotionally numb he is a leather-clad avenging angel desperately chasing every lead to get the truth. The filmmakers pull out every cliche to help him along. Hes being framed for murder. Theres a connection between a creepy-looking tattoo and mysterious deaths. Max and his former partner Alex (Donal Logue) are on the outs. No one in the police force understands him. The only people who know the truth and can help him are dead. Throw in the involvement of military officials gone bad and a corrupt pharmaceutical giant and just about all the predictable bases are covered. At a key point Nelly Furtado who plays Alexs wife slaps Max after firing off a cutting remark ""What has Max Payne ever done except bring misery?"" Exactly. At intervals director John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines) kindly realizes we need a respite from things blown to smithereens or blasted apart by machine guns so someone is instructed to let loose a blood-curdling beastly yell. The yells are connected to the ingestion of a blue liquid drug contained in vials which we learn is part of a military experiment gone awry. Wahlberg lets loose at least three of these inhuman screams and you cant help but wonder where the fine actor in The Departed and even Invincible has gone. Its not been a good year for Wahlberg First The Happening and now this. Max is an unlikely hero. Stuck at a desk job for several years somehow he has managed to keep his trigger finger in good working order and even ratchet up his attack skills killing off legions of trained gunmen and evading hordes of policemen. Did we mention the movie is based on a video game? That might explain the laughable dialogue. A woman is brutally murdered. ""She will not be the last"" intones someone clearly in the know. ""The devil is building up his army."" ""He isnt going to stop"" warns another knowing character. But in case hes thinking of taking a much-needed break he is spurred on by Mila Kunis vaguely sinister character ""You have to finish this."" Should he have a moment of doubt she insists ""Youre not done yet."" Which raises the biggest fear of all a sequel.

"Max Payne In a world of hurt | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMax Payne In a world of hurtTheres a reason so many movies these days are based on video games and comics. Both media offer proven pre-formed pre-sold concepts and characters and are by definition inherently visual - aggressively accelerated relentlessly action-packed explosively excessive eye-candy.By ROB SALEMEntertainment ColumnistFri. Oct. 17 2008 (out of 4)Starring Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and Beau Bridges. Written by Beau Thorne based on the video game. Directed by John Moore. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued Below Theres a reason so many movies these days are based on video games and comics. Both media offer proven pre-formed pre-sold concepts and characters and are by definition inherently visual - aggressively accelerated relentlessly action-packed explosively excessive eye-candy.And then theres Max Payne a game-inspired movie aptly named ... and unfortunately none of the above.With valkyries.Ive played the original video game (there is a sequel) maybe once and I dont remember valkyries. I remember a fictitious street drug ""valkyr."" But not one single winged red-eyed razor-talond Nordic female avenger. Perhaps I did not advance far enough through the game (not being 12 years old and all). Maybe they saved the valkyries for the sequel.Or maybe somebody decided the movie was already so convoluted and leaden that throwing in a few swooping screeching valkyries could only help. They do not.There is ""Marky"" Mark Wahlberg - who has at this point so damaged his hard-earned status as a credible film actor he must now be referred to only by his old white rapper name - playing a drowning New York cop who starts out by narrating his own imminent death a la William Holden in Sunset Boulevard. This is not needless to say Sunset Boulevard. Nor is it really New York the movie having been shot here and in Hamilton to save money (no doubt thanks to a special tax break that you can only get by casting Canadian singer Nelly Furtado in a minor role).This money was obviously otherwise spent on fake bullets. We know they are fake because no one but Max Payne ever hits anything even possessed of the kind of endlessly reloading clips you cannot find anywhere else but in TV and movies.The other exception being bad guy Beau Bridges who does run out of ammo - twice. And if he did see his younger brother Jeffs stellar performance as the bad guy in Iron Man he learned absolutely nothing from it. (Just as Paynes rookie writer and director neglected to check the box-office receipts from Super Mario Brothers Street Fighter Mortal Kombat and Doom.)With all the bullets flying one expects a little ""bullet time"" - the slowed-down 3D tracking shot popularized by The Matrix and a major defining feature of the original Max Payne video game.But then the games stated inspiration was John Woo action flicks and aside from an occasional two-handed diving bullet-volley Max Payne the movie bears no resemblance to one of those either.

Honestly whats the point? I know PG-13 is the new R; the Motion Picture Association of Americas ratings system is a lot more flexible-lenient-craven than it used to be. When Judd Apatow comedies and the grotty-Guignol The Dark Knight can secure the unrestricted rating its clear that the old sheriff has been replaced by a parole board. But if an R means anything its that moviegoers get to see the bone-cratering damage a fist can do to a face get to feel the impact of a body splattering on a pavement get to appreciate more than the contours of a luscious model whos removing her clothes. PG-13 is the tease; R is the payoff. Max Payne based on the search-and-destroy game created by Finlands ""Sam Lake"" (Sami Jarvi) is a tease in more ways than even the MPAA can imagine. Theres a long line of video-game-to-movie transfers -- Super Mario Bros. Street Fighter Mortal Kombat Final Fantasy Lara Croft Tomb Raider Doom Resident Evil Alone in the Dark Hitman and DOA Dead or Alive not to mention about a quillion Japanese animes (Pokemon and its brethren) -- and a seemingly infinite number of VG adaptations to come film versions such game franchises as God of War Gears of War Metal Gear Solid Lost Planet Prince of Persia EverQuest Mass Effect Uncharted Drakes Fortune the blessed Sims and yikes PacMan. (Cant wait for other retro movies based on the earliest video games Frogger Space Invaders and -- some French minimalist directorll do it -- Pong.) Ill leave it to a true VG scholar like my colleague Lev Grossman to flesh out my theory that its graphic novels not video games that have proved the more reliable source for good movies. Maybe its that the adult comix provide stories and storyboards while the video games supply only a premise; or that reading an illustrated novel is closer to the movie-watching experience than the Zen numbness that overcomes gamesmen in their 27th hour at the console. That kind of sensory exhaustion is what the viewer feels before Max Payne has lumbered to its conclusion. The makers of the Max movie -- director John Moore screenwriter Beau Thorne -- want you to think of their effort as less video game than film noir. Or a Woo noir since the picture owes a lot to the visual grit and zazz of John Woo the Hong Kong director (A Better Tomorrow The Killer Hard Boiled) who made good in Hollywood with the crackerjack Face/Off. Surly men in overcoats trudge through a nightscape with very busy meteorology when it isnt pouring rain there are snowflakes everywhere like the residue from an Olympian pillow fight. And down these gaudily monochromatic streets a strong scarred man comes into closeup Max Payne renegade cop.

"Max Payne | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; max-payne ) Max Payne (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""I dont believe in heaven. I believe in pain. I believe in fear. I believe in death."" So states Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) elucidating his nihilistic creed during the films opening moments. While the movie bearing the title characters name holds true to the darkness of those words throughout the narrative that unspools may have audience members unfamiliar with the video game source thinking of the The Bards quote about sound and fury signifying nothing. Visually this is an interesting movie. A lot of time is spent getting everything to look right and the color desaturation evokes memories of film noir. Unfortunately the storyline is only as coherent as it needs to be to get the audience from Point A to Point B. Max Payne follows the trajectory of an old-school video game adaptation which is to say that it sacrifices plot and character development in favor of mindless action. This sort of thing can be enjoyable when theres an interactive element to it. Take away the buttons and knobs however and it quickly becomes repetitive. Thats the problem with too many game-to-movie productions - they are constrained by a desire to remain ""true"" to the material from which they originate. Max Payne has a solid setup but fails to take it anywhere remotely interesting. We end up with a guy running around shooting things in the dark. The narrative is basic. Max is an NYPD homicide detective who has been working cold case files since his wife and infant child were murdered. He is obsessed with catching the person responsible for the crime and that desire has consumed him. While many of his leads result in dead-ends Max eventually finds a live one. He is joined in his quest for justice by a lady assassin Mona Sax (Mila Kunis) whose sister may have been killed by the person Max is seeking. Other allies include his fathers former partner BB (Beau Bridges) and an Internal Affairs cop (Chris Ludacris Bridges) who is technically investigating Maxs involvement in several questionable deaths. At the heart of everything lies a government conspiracy and a highly addictive drug that when taken can cause superhuman abilities and supernatural hallucinations. The films most interesting sequences are those in which we see through the eyes of the drug users. Their world is a grim trippy place inhabited by winged demons and other bizarre Ministers of Grace. The film could have done a lot with this imagery such as implied that this ""second world"" is real but unseen by normal humans but its not that smart. Ultimately these sequences end up as eye candy - ways to punctuate an overly familiar stillborn story that wears out its welcome. The character of Mona is equally pointless. Theres potential there as well but its left untapped. Mona could have been an intriguing sidekick or adversary but she isnt in enough of the movie to serve either purpose well. Max Payne would have been better served by deleting this extraneous appendage altogether but thats not a move that would have made gamers happy. One wonders whether theyll be pleased with her fleeting appearances including one in which she dons deus ex machina garb. Mark Wahlberg grins and bears it. Actually he doesnt grin much but he does bear it. He goes into stone-face mode which reminds us that he like most capable actors can do these ""paycheck"" roles with the best of them. Theres nothing memorable or interesting about his performance; the only positive thing I can say is that its a step up from his work in The Happening. Mila Kunas is cool and sexy but she doesnt have enough screen time to be anything more. Ludacris acquits himself better than most of his co-stars delivering his lines with a gravity to match the grayish cinematography. Beau Bridges is bad in a way that not only assassinates his character but makes a supposed twist transparent. The film provides ample opportunity to attack the MPAAs hypocrisy. Max Payne is a bloodbath yet it manages a PG-13 rating by keeping the explicitness of the killings just a whisker shy of what would be necessary for an R. Never mind that the plot is about an obsessed man trying to slaughter those responsible for his loved ones deaths or that the body count makes that of the average slasher movie look tame or that a subplot involves drug addiction. Despite all of this the movie is deemed okay for teenagers yet the bare breasts of a woman have to be turned from the camera for fear of corrupting young minds. I keep waiting for the first truly great video game movie and with games becoming increasingly more complex I approach each such motion picture with cautious optimism. It has to happen at some time but Max Payne isnt it. Maybe fans of the game will be okay with the cinematic adaptation but for those who arent new to Max and his world this isnt an impressive introduction. Clunky action chaotic plotting and embarrassing dialogue are not ways to impress newcomers. Theres plenty of Payne to be found here - in more ways than one.

Mark Wahlberg stars in the title role as a New York City detective trying to solve the murder of his wife in an eardrum-stomping shoot-em-all flick that started as a video game and didnt make it a whole lot farther down the road than that. Its got a look though If you bring earplugs you might be able to appreciate it as a beady-eyed and sharp-toothed little noir that explodes against a backdrop of washed-out color bleak blacks and decaying grays. Along for the fun is an assassin from the Russian mob (Mila Kunis) a fellow detective (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and an ex-cop and old friend (Beau Bridges - where has this guy been?). Payne is chasing the secret behind a sinister pharmaceutical companys new product a drug that turns you into either a superman or a lunatic but probably both. The freaky images of what happens after you pop the drug are among the most visually overpowering in a movie that is alive with hallucinatory scenes. When youre high on the mystery substance the world turns into a harrowing fire-washed dreamscape beset by winged monsters. So its a bit like puberty. Looks only give you half a movie though and the other half is purely perfunctory. Racing through lonely alleys and looming on stark rooftops ""Max Payne"" clatters from one action set piece to the next. Typically a small army of bad guys in riot gear will corner him and Max will resolve the situation by punching or shooting somebody and running away while managing to dodge a few thousand rounds of ammunition. The attempts to out- Matrix ""The Matrix"" with bullet-time super-slo mo are staged with such theatrics that theyre unintentionally funny. This movie also has ""Blade Runner"" on its mind and Raymond Chandler but mostly its a weak little sister to ""Sin City."" MAX PAYNE Ammo dump. Running time 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence profanity sexual situations). At the Orpheum the 84th Street the 34th Street others.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 16 2008 228 PM We can all agree that Mark Wahlberg is a pretty big star right? Which means he cant be desperate for exposure and hes probably not lacking in cash. So why exactly would he bother making undiluted junk like ""Max Payne""? If hes seen the final product one can only assume hes asking himself the same question. ""MP"" is based on a video game and the standard for this particular genre is not especially high. But no amount of generosity could excuse the levels of ineptitude on display here. RELATED ""MAX PAYNE"" STAR LUDACRIS AIMS TO KEEP IT VARIED Wahlberg is Payne a loner detective still obsessed with the murders of his wife and child years ago. The case had gone cold until recently when a beautiful woman named Natasha (upcoming Bond girl Olga Kurylenko) turned up dead. Unfortunately for Payne she was carrying his ID at the time. So if hes going to solve the crime hell have to do it before his boss (Ludacris) arrests him. His first clue comes from Natashas sister (Mila Kunis) an assassin who points him to a junkie den. Natasha was among those addicted to Valkyr a drug originally designed to make soldiers feel invincible. Official use had to be discontinued when the soldiers wound up with horrific hallucinations but its clear somebodys got a bigger plan. That somebody however is neither director John Moore nor screenwriter Beau Thorne. Nearly every element screams ""straight-to-DVD"" from the overworked rain machine and hyperventilating score to the generic Canadian background laughably substituting for New York. The story has more holes than a shot-up metal door the acting feels bored at best and the intermittent action while passable hardly makes up for the downtime. All Moore had to do was find a halfway decent reason to get us into the theater. Without it we might as well just stay home and play the game.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Thinking carefully about a stupid action movie like ""Max Payne"" could cause a brain hemorrhage so lets not try to disentangle the plot. This film was made because its source material a popular video game had a presold audience not because it was trying to say something vital about corporate greed the Russian mafia mind-bending military battle drugs and gun control. Beau Thorne a recent film school graduate with no previous feature credits wrote the screenplay as if he were paid per explosion and director John Moore has mostly made remakes (""The Omen"" and ""Flight of the Phoenix"" do-overs were his). The result is dark moody extremely twisted and hard to enjoy on any level. Call it ""Bad Max."" Mark Wahlberg plays Max a New York City police detective who has been feeling pretty glum since persons unknown killed his beautiful wife and baby. He frowns all the time skulks around in black leather coats and took a demotion to the Cold Case division so he can spend all day poring over the files looking for clues. As a pick-me-up he trolls the subway system for drug-dealing degenerates he can beat up or shoot as an extracurricular contribution to the citys cleanup efforts. New York is a pretty glum place too with a perpetual snowstorm that never stops but somehow fails to create drifts. Moore has copied the bleak retro-noir visuals of Frank Millers ""Sin City"" John Woos operatic way with shootouts and slow-motion Bullet Time gymnastics from ""The Matrix."" Max is a sourpuss bummer of a protagonist so obsessed with revenge that hes incapable of relating emotionally to his fellow cops or sexually to the attractive Natasha an exotic Russian import who falls into his bed. Natasha is played by Olga Kurylenko the Bond Girl in the upcoming ""Quantum of Solace""; the one reason I can imagine to endure ""Max Payne"" is as a preview of coming attractions. The linchpin of the plot is a performance-enhancing battlefield drug that gives users surreal visions of winged spectres and Max wants to snuff out the suppliers. As Wahlberg lone-wolfs his way through his quest we have time to admire the films moody atmospheric visuals and the exuberantly staged gunfights frenzied ballets of firepower that reduce Maxs adversaries to so much bloody chum. But theres no suspense about who betrayed Max -- the universe of the film is so narrow that theres only one suspect and sure enough thats the culprit. Theres no sleuthing no surprises no drive to the story except the momentum of one shootout toppling into the next. Theres no pleasure in this Payne.

Max Payne has the hollow part down pat but theres nothing active about it. Its just a grindingly inert death-wish thriller in which Max (Mark Wahlberg) a stone-cold detective whose wife and infant were mysteriously murdered tries to solve the crime and exact his revenge. The movie is a series of glum interrogation scenes that lead nowhere special with a not-quite-sci-fi urban murkiness that makes it look like someone was trying to shoot Blade Runner in Cleveland.

Starring Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and Beau Bridges. Directed by John Moore. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The guy next to me started snoring during ""Max Payne."" In another movie that would have been annoying. But being a critic is sometimes like being a medical examiner and for me it was revealing to note precisely when this fellow lost consciousness. Sleep came at the point when the onscreen hero no longer had a motive for action. Heres where the story goes cold Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is supposedly investigating the death of his wife and child but 30 minutes into the movie there are no suspects. He is also supposedly investigating the murder of two other people but he doesnt really care about those people. So Max has no purpose. To be blunt he has no business being the protagonist of a movie. At that point theres no reason to be in a theater watching him. What happens to audiences when stories flatline like that? Peoples senses start shutting off. They go into suspended animation even if its only noon and they were wide awake only minutes before. Anything in the outside world would engage them at least enough to keep them up and about. But bad movies are like knockout drops - or like dark tunnels that break the spirit with no promise of escape. Unless youre an experienced professional you should not mess with them. A critic can stay alert through movies that would put elephants into comas but I doubt most people will stay awake for ""Max Payne."" The movie is based on a video game - surprise surprise - and everything in it looks shadowy and cavernous. Max is a police detective who walks the night looking for the man who wrecked his life but our respect for Max is instantly diminished by knowing inside five minutes who killed his wife and child. This is what characters in movies need to do when looking for the guilty party. They need to ask themselves ""If this were a movie who would have done it?"" Its not going to be someone out of the blue. Its going to be someone in the cast. So just look around and take a wild guess. With its flat story numbed-out protagonist and faux artistic lighting and set design - everything is dark or moody or darkishly moody or moodily dark - ""Max Payne"" seems a good half hour longer than its running time. Wahlberg looks put-upon throughout a natural response to being in this picture. Mila Kunis (from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") plays some Russian mafia type whod be the love interest if Max werent too depressed to kiss somebody. And Beau Bridges plays Maxs genial older friend a great guy who just wants to offer advice and counsel a good generous trusted decent fellow who wouldnt hurt a soul and only wants the best for Max. Some movies are so silly so lousy and so transparent that theyre truly almost lovable. ...

Stylishly made armed to the teeth and ludicrous in the extreme ""Max Payne"" sends its eponymous antihero into New Yorks underbelly on a deranged quest for revenge. Along the way director John Moore unleashes every visual trick in his arsenal the flashiest being a hail of bullets that whoosh across the screen in delirious slow-motion -- no doubt to distract auds from an increasingly risible story involving tattooed corpses Norse mythology demonic hallucinations and perhaps the weirdest cinematic reference yet to the ""war on terror."" Fans of the popular vidgame franchise and Mark Wahlberg should ensure brawny B.O. and ancillary returns. As reconceived for the screen by first-time scribe Beau Thorne New York detective Max Payne bears some temperamental similarities to the gifted sniper Wahlberg played in last years ""Shooter."" Like Bob Lee Swagger Max is a laconic disgruntled badass whos handy with a gun lives in self-imposed exile (hes transferred himself to the NYPDs cold-cases department) and winds up on the run accused of a murder he didnt commit. Make that two murders. The first victim is a voluptuous Russian babe Natasha (Olga Kurylenko) whose unique body art provides a clue as to who or what was responsible for her brutal dismemberment. The second victim is the cop (Donal Logue) who was assigned to the still-unsolved murders of Maxs wife Michelle (Marianthi Evans seen in flashback) and their young child. Determined to avenge his family Max teams up with Natashas less trashy more trigger-happy sister Mona Sax (Mila Kunis ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and seeks sympathetic advice from ex-cop BB Hensley (Beau Bridges) now a top exec at Aesir the major pharmaceutical company where Michelle used to work. Its here that ""Max Payne"" goes quite literally to Hell as the disillusioned detective realizes a link between Aesir and the pushers of a powerfully addictive drug that induces fiery visions of winged Valkyrie-like demons. And you thought ""The Constant Gardener"" was scary. Before it derails with a climax that seems to have borrowed a few scenes from the ""The Incredible Hulk"" ""Max Payne"" strives valiantly to imbue its hoary vigilante-thriller cliches and police-procedural tropes with authentic grit and emotion. But a fleeting mention of the Iraq War amounts to little more than a pseudo-topical feint (proof that the U.S.-Mideast conflict is officially ripe for action-pic exploitation) and scenes meant to emotionally anchor the drama are dashed off with perfunctory haste. Not helping matters is Wahlbergs guarded performance which (somewhat surprisingly given the subtle shadings of personality the actor displayed in ""Shooter"") fails to make Max Payne the character much of an improvement on Max Payne the avatar. The 2001 videogame and its 2003 sequel were notable for their innovative third-person-shooter interface -- heavily influenced by the balletic action on display in ""The Matrix"" and the films of John Woo -- which allowed players to slow down time while firing and dodging bullets. Fans will be duly impressed with how the pic incorporates the gimmick though needless to say its not nearly as much fun as actually playing the game. Moore whose strong compositional eye enlivened such otherwise routine action fare as ""Flight of the Phoenix"" and ""Behind Enemy Lines"" artfully blends vidgame and film-noir aesthetics (dramatic overhead camera angles intense use of chiaroscuro bursts of red onscreen to emphasize the impact of the violence) while editor Dan Zimmermans measured rhythms yield a more coherent less frenzied work than one might expect from the source material. Daniel T. Dorrances urban-grunge production design and Jonathan Selas shadowy widescreen lensing of various Toronto locations add up to a reasonably convincing and atmospheric simulacrum of the games interactive environment before the visual overload of the final scenes. Post-credits sequence promises the obligatory unrequested sequel. Max PayneProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a Firm Films/Depth Entertainment production.

Mark Wahlberg stars in Max Payne about a detective seeking revenge for the death of his wife and infant daughter. Photo MICHAEL MULLER TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX Max Payne 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Max Payne accomplishes the nearly impossible. It is overloaded with excruciatingly long brain-hurting rambling scenes of dull exposition yet manages to remain a muddle confusing mess. And why is all of the talking necessary? You would think a movie based on a video game would spend more time with gun battles and big explosions. Those scenes are there but they dont come until the final 15 minutes. By then you will be ready to do anything to make the Payne stop. Mark Wahlberg takes a backward career step as the brooding Det. Max Payne. The New York cop has been obsessed the past three years trying to find the person who killed his wife and infant daughter. This obsession finally begins to pay off when Payne gets involved with the sister of a female mobster who might be connected to the people who know the guy who was involved with an incident that possibly was connected to the death of Paynes family. (There is more to that connection but why put you through it?) Every scene stops so one or more actors can explain the obvious. There are only two things you really need to know Someone is mad and a lot of people are going to die. How that happens is what is supposed to make this kind of movie fun to watch. Director John Moore pushes the dead-weight script along in a world where it is either raining or snowing. And he washes out the color in each scene to intensify the films dark themes of revenge and obsession. It doesnt work. The result is a movie that longs to have the style of Sin City but fails miserably. Wahlberg sleepwalks through the picture. Incredibly miscast is That 70s Show star Mila Kunis as the female mobster. She showed with Forgetting Sarah Marshall she can handle light comedy but her attempt to play this tough-gal part is ludicrous. Its amazing that a big-screen version of an action-packed video game can end up being such an endurance test. If anyone was hoping for a new film franchise Max Payne should make them realize its ""game over."" Todays Deals Nordstrom Rack Clear the Rack Sale Up to 75% off + free...

Its Sin City Lite with winged Valkyrie who snatch tormented souls from one underworld to another.One thing you can say for this John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines) actioner It hides its video-game roots reasonably well better than it hides its Toronto-subbing-for- New York locations. Mark Wahlberg is the title character a cop who buried his pregnant wife three years before. Hes a cop whos been hiding out in the cold-case department hunting for the tattooed butchers who cut up his missus.Theres a new drug on the streets and its killing the people who use it. Dark wraiths swoop in and take them out or so they think. Max stumbles into this scene is linked to the death of a stunning Russian strumpet (Olga Kurylenko)O and begins to wonder if this new go-go juice is somehow connected to his late wifes murder. Before the cops can settle on Max as a suspect his former partner (Donal Logue)O is murdered while trying to pass along clues. Mila Kunis cast because she looks oh-so-hot in black -- but miscast nevertheless -- plays Mona Natashas sister a hit woman we assume.""You know what I do for a living"" she purrs. If she didnt have a gun we wouldnt have a clue. Mona wants to find her sisters killer. She and Max should work together right? Beau Bridges plays BB (ha) an ex-cop who tries to keep Max out of trouble. Chris ODonnellO is an ex-colleague of Maxs wife and the rapper Ludacris a mediocre actor is a cop in Internal Affairs. None of them is as funny as the tattoo artist (Stephen R. Hart) who drops his ""man"" and ""dude"" speak to launch into a discourse on Norse mythology.The storys a real eye-roller a loose collection of cop and conspiracy-picture cliches that do little to disguise the obvious direction things are headed. But Moore stages a good gunfight. Several as a matter of fact -- blizzards of bullets smacking into snow ice office furniture and flesh. Max Payne is a PG-13 movie begging for an R. The story is told in flashback as when we meet Max hes drowning under an icy river. And narrating as he does.""I dont believe in heaven. I believe in pain. I believe in fear. I believe in death.""I believe Im logging onto Hulu.com to see that Saturday Night Live send-up of Wahlberg acting -- ""Mark Wahlberg Talks to Animals"" -- again.Max Payne isnt the worst video-game movie adaptation not so long as Uwe Boll lives breathes and directs. The actings not bad overall; the shootouts work. But as good as a couple of its action beats are Max still suffers from the heartlessness that makes games emotionally inferior to movies. Nobody ever shed a tear over a video-game characters death.

Or have studios gotten so lazy that they figure hey this games popular lets toss off a movie and maybe the kids who play it will buy tickets? Max Payne offers a little evidence for both sides but more for the latter. The film based on a popular third-person shooter game stars Mark Wahlberg as Max a cop whose wife and child were killed by thugs. Hes working the cold-case unit a loner who cares little about his job but is obsessed with solving his wifes murder. That means long nights out on the streets chasing leads meeting unsavory characters and naturally firing a lot of guns. Maxs world is dark and cold - snow blows constantly but it seems to make the city dirtier. He runs across a woman named Natasha (Olga Kurylenko) who is later brutally murdered; she stole his wallet so the cops want answers. Except he doesnt have any. He teams up with Natashas sister Mona Sax (Mila Kunis) - an assassin because well why not? - to try to get to the bottom of Natashas murder and possibly that of Maxs family. There also are other murders in which the victims see black winged creatures (as Natasha did). A menacing tattooed brute named Lupino (Amaury Nolasco) seems to be around every time someone is killed slurping an electric-blue substance and screaming. B.B. Hensley (Beau Bridges) Maxs fathers former partner on the force wants Max to pull back stop seeking his wifes killer. Not much chance of that. Bridges has a good time in the films most interesting role and Wahlberg is his usual understated self (as understated as a guy whos constantly killing people can be that is). But the film doesnt add up. The story involving conspiracies doesnt always make sense. And the surprises are easy to predict; director John Moore doesnt try to hide them. Instead he relies on hallucinatory visuals to hold the audiences interest. Some are undeniably stunning. But it also is the kind of film where armed-to-the-teeth police marksmen fire automatic weapons at Max squeezing off thousands of rounds yet miss him. The film isnt meant to be realistic of course but a heightened reality. It relies not on narrative and such but on pumped-up action. Kind of like a video game. Go figure.
