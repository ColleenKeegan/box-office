"Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Cinderella Cant Have Everything << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Cinderella Cant Have Everything TWC Radius Movies March 17 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print It Follows directed by David Robert Mitchell Right now the campus-sexual-assault documentary The Hunting Ground is bringing people to tears and outraging universities with its incriminating concentration of dire statistics and accounts from activist survivors. Theres no breaking news just an overwhelming seemingly insurmountable wall of anecdotes concerning a staggering number of alleged rapes administrative cover-ups denials and meager punishments. That film got eerie company last week from It Follows a slasher film of sorts with a great name and a chilling metaphorical handle on sex and assault. What it lacks in actual slashing it makes up for in atmosphere. Most of it evokes the attacks on lust that flourished in Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho and The Birds and that were rampant in the high school nightmare movies of the 1970s and 1980s. It Follows is set in a suburban Detroit where teens are raised on a steady diet of old science fiction and monster movies with nary a parent in sight. Jay (Maika Monroe) thinks shes on a fun date with Hugh (Jake Weary) only to discover after she wakes up tied to a wheelchair in her underwear that shed been chloroformed and driven to an empty parking lot. Its a date from hell. Shes been cursed Hugh tells her because they had sex. Something is going to keep following her in various human forms until she either passes the curse to someone else through intercourse or the curse kills her. Indeed theres a naked woman chasing them in the lot -- Hughs previous date. As an allegory this is surprisingly free of glibness. Mitchell merges the grim adolescent rites of horror movies with the grisly risks of having a libido at any age. (The men and women chasing her range in age and size and beauty.) The horror of the scenario is as much emotional as it is visceral -- maybe more so given the amount of time the film shows the kids just sitting around bored. Like Jennifer Kents crazier more grandiose The Babadook from last year Mitchell turns post-traumatic stress into a kind of schlock art. It Follows dares to personify the anxiety around such disparate subjects as arousal assault and sexually transmitted disease and make them supernatural. Because a lot of what is going on here scary-movie-wise has been well established by scores of other films Mitchell doesnt have to overdo the social commentary. The anonymous metaphysical stalking is its own comment. Laurie Sparham/Fox Searchlight The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel directed by John Madden Not far into this sequel to the 2012 hit Judi Dench explains to an Indian scarf vendor why shes chosen him as opposed to his competitors (something about the quality of his silk). She does so with the delicacy used to put a child to sleep. When shes done the vendor gives her a warm bath of a look and does the equivalent of wrapping her in a towel. ""Thank you for your respect"" he all but sings. As preemptive disclaimers go its right up there with ""based on a true story"" and "" you wouldnt really hit a guy with glasses would you?"" This one says ""Be kind to us. We harmed no Indians in the making of this movie."" But for a film like this -- in which a handful of British people ransack Jaipur with their heartaches verbal sniping and doctors visits -- some recognition of the narrative imbalance is merited. The whole movie is caught somewhere between apology and entitlement. But Madden and writer Ol Parker keep the plots lubricated with mild geriatric comedy that Maggie Smith Celia Imrie Bill Nighy and Ronald Pickup among others can play without much heavy lifting. (Nighy barely has to enunciate as he tries to make Dench commit to him.) There are more story lines and coincidences than there are people in Jaipur. Even Richard Gere is now on the scene as an American who claims hes writing a book and whom Imrie already drowning in Indian suitors sees as another potential snack. But Sonny (Dev Patel) the proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel where the old white Brits have all moved swears that Gere is there evaluating Sonnys suitability for an Exotic Marigold franchise. Most of the plots concern Sonnys upcoming wedding to Sunaina (Tina Desai) whos annoyed that Sonny would rather flatter Gere than rehearse the reception dance. Sonnys jealous of Sunainas family friend who just bought the building Sonny was eying for his expansion. Patels the one doing all the lifting (hes about a third of Smiths age). Most of what hes picking up is Indian kitsch. He doesnt seem to know how demeaning all of this obsequiousness appears. But its the situation hes playing not the ""yes boss"" fawning. And some of his situations are actually funny. Some are not. One character is gravely ill. And Penelope Wilton returns as Nighys toxic wife Jean -- she practically is a disease. You watch it all in a state of amused disgust. This isnt the will to live. Its mortis interruptus. Twentieth Century Fox Unfinished Business directed by Ken Scott Tom Wilkinson was the best thing about the original Marigold Hotel. His character came out of the closet then died. Now instead of frolicking in Jaipur Wilkinson is in a flat confused Vince Vaughn comedy about three generations of businessmen fighting for a bacon-saving deal (Dave Franco is the rookie). One mild strength of the Marigold Hotel movies is that it knows what it is and who its for. This movie directed by Ken Scott has no idea. It needs a director who can handle the mix of the bizarre the raucous and the conventional the collision of tequila slaps keg stands G8 protest riots and Sienna Miller as an American business sniper. But come on. The only person whod know how to get a single movie out of scenes that include Vaughn talking to penises that droop out of glory holes at a German leather bar then FaceTiming with his outcast Midwestern tweens might be John Waters whod never go near Steven Conrads script. The movie either needs to be a carnival or a Jack Lemmon-style scenery-chewing drama. Instead its a pebble at the bottom of the vast canyon between the two. The domestic scenes feel at odds with say Francos latest erect-penis trick and the ongoing misuse of the wonderful Nick Frost here doing more of his poor-fat-me bit. The movie gets dumber and more desperate as it goes. By Vaughns track record this counts as another turkey like 2013s Delivery Man also directed by Scott. But I didnt leave either movie convinced the problem is Vaughn. The talkaholic lunatic act that made him famous is aging into a place of comedic stability. Hes now the least crazy least naughty person in his films and that has made him a fascinating actor. The best scenes in this movie put Vaughn in a German art installation that simulates a businessmans hotel-office (please dont ask). In front of an audience Vaughn takes calls and explains his job going from reluctance to open participation. As long as hes running his mouth and keeping his cool hes a star. Otherwise a movie like this misses the point of Vince Vaughn. Even when it seems as though hes being allowed to stretch theres nothing in the material to challenge him. Until he has another shot to reestablish contact with a dark side (the late 1990s -- Clay Pigeons Psycho -- seem like a hundred years ago) hes languishing in generic straight man parts. As a comedic performer hes a hall-of-fame wingman. He either needs to find better worthier experiments (like the upcoming second round of True Detective) or the movies need to let him fly again.

That said there do on occasion exist equations that are not to be trifled with. Take for example the algebraic logic underlying The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel the sequel to 2012s surprise hit which might be summarized as (Judi Dench + Bill Nighy + Maggie Smith) x screenwriter Ol Parker x director John Madden. Is it possible that this formula could produce an unsatisfying product? There were moments during the sequel I confess when I feared it might. But ultimately the assembled talent and wistful charm won out.Related Story The Real-Life Philomena You See So Much Hurt Caused by Anger The movie follows in the wake of its predecessor in which a motley group of English retirees rediscovered themselves following a move to a pensioners hotel in India. The new installment opens in broad but likable farce Sonny (Dev Patel) the proprietor of the original hotel and Muriel (Maggie Smith) his skeptical tenant-turned-partner visit San Diego to take a meeting about the possible expansion of their franchise to a second venue.Despite or perhaps because of the salty hilarity of Muriel the corporate executive receiving their pitch (a sadly underutilized David Strathairn) promises to consider the proposal and hints that he will send someone incognito to assess the current property and its management. Its little wonder that when a handsome stranger named Guy Chambers (played by Richard Gere) shows up at the (original) Best Exotic Marigold Hotel he is presumed to be that someone.Meanwhile Sonny and his fiancee Sunaina (Tena Desae) are preparing for their wedding though bumpily so. A handsome friend (Shazad Latif) has returned to town and appears--to Sonny at least--to be a competitor both for Sunainas affections and for the additional property Sonny hopes to acquire.There are several other ""meanwhiles"" on offer as well--too many in fact and for the most part too derivative of what has come before. The quiet courtship between Douglas (Nighy) and Evelyn (Dench) that formed the emotional core of the first film is ongoing; Norman (Ronald Pickup) and Carol (Diana Hardcastle) suffer their own romantic misunderstandings; man-eater Madge (Celia Imrie) cant decide where best to direct her appetite; and Douglass estranged wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) visits from England to once again bestow her bone-deep dissatisfaction with life. Its perhaps ungenerous to say of the rare film featuring a mostly senior cast but this is a sequel that could have used new blood or at least new situations.The chief pleasures here are the most familiar ones Smiths tart tongue Nighys bottomless likability.Richard Gere might have been the answer were it not for the compromising fact that he is Richard Gere. Though perfectly capable he brings with him a waft of such overpowering American rom-com-ness that he destabilizes nearly every scene he is in. One half expects Julia Roberts to show up in a bathtub or in her running shoes.No the chief pleasures here are the most familiar ones The tart tongue of Smith (on her trip to America ""I went with low expectations and came back disappointed""); the gravitational pull of Denchs charisma; the humanism and bottomless likability of Nighy (""The great horror of life is that theres just so much bloody potential""); the infectious exuberance of Patel.Like so many unplanned sequels The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel finds itself in the catch-22 of trying to recreate the circumstances of its predecessors success without merely recapitulating them. Whether or not it ultimately succeeds will depend on how individual viewers weigh the movies narrative flaws against the profound appeal of its stars and setting. For my part it was a reminder that sometimes second best is good enough.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Photo Laurie Sparham/Twentieth Century Fox Chances are if you likedA The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel youll like the second best one as well. The original packed a thousand old-person-in-a-foreign-land cliches but tempered them with sweet insights into old age and some fine performances; the new one does pretty much the same. Its more predictable sure but predictability is part of its game. Maybe the word were looking for isntA predictable; maybe itsA comfortable. The sequel picks up the Anglo pensioner inhabitants of this charmingly rundown Indian hotel nine months after the events of the original. Everybodys settling in nicely; whereas the first film was about the culture clash of aging Westerners in India now theyre slowly integrating. Muriel (Maggie Smith) once a bitter xenophobe is now helping hotel proprietor Sonny (Dev Patel) try to expand his operation. Madge (Celia Imrie) who was an unrepentant single in the first film is now seeing two wealthy Indian men each of whom wants to pop the question. Evelyn (Judi Dench) who once found herself becoming increasingly replaceable in both life and work has just been offered a job as a textile purchaser; meanwhile her relationship with once-married Douglas (Bill Nighy) which gave the first film an adulterous kick remains unconsummated to both of their bewilderment and frustration. As for Sonny himself he remains his ambitious energetic self prone to florid pronouncements and unwelcome asides about death. (""The hotel is full with nobody checking out ... until the ultimate checkout"" ""From here to the hospital its only a short walk ... or a short stretcher ride"") The first film skirted the boundaries of good taste with its one-dimensional depiction of him its lone Indian protagonist. But now Sonny is preparing to marry Sunaina (Tina Desai) and thus has a bit more to do than run around acting like an idiot though he still does some of that too. (The film is structured around the three main parts of an Indian wedding ceremony which thankfully also gives the rest of the Indian characters something to do.) Ol Parkers script has quite a lot to juggle when you think about it Not only does it have to integrate the wedding into the plot it also has to perform this movies version of fan service Give each member of its cast of heavyweights something meaty to do. (These are after all some of the finest actors in the known universe and you cant just have them stand around.) It also has to handle the introduction of a new character a somewhat enigmatic author played by Richard Gere who Sonny is convinced is a hotel inspector despite all appearances to the contrary (a subplot that recalls a classic Fawlty Towers episode). It could have easily become a dogs breakfast of subplots and wacky-old-person shenanigans. But the proceedings remain dignified and smooth thanks to the game cast some decent romantic tension (particularly between Nighy and Dench as well as Gere and Lillete Dubey as Sonnys mother) and John Maddens elegant patient camera. The title says it all This is second best so dont expect much. But for those who adored the original itll do.A Tagsthe second best exotic marigold hoteljudi denchbill nighyrichard geredev patelmaggie smithmoviesMore Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories What Do the Women of Cleveland Want From Melania Trump?

This time around the story is driven by the young proprietor Sonny (Dev Patel) who is simultaneously preparing to marry his fiancee and expand his hospitality empire. His ambition for the latter tends to overshadow his devotion to the former with predictable results. Meanwhile his aging clientele wrestles with issues of commitment complicated pasts failing health and fickle hearts. There are perhaps a couple more storylines than two hours can successfully tie up and more than one scene feels like its there just to give these old lions a chance to sport about a bit. But theres a sweetness to the proceedings that never quite overpowers the melancholy of maturity and a sympathy for human frailty that stops just short of suggesting that anything goes once everything starts to go.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post There is a cheekiness as well as an earnestness to the title ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" It winks A sequel embraces its knock-off status. It also teases This comedys malapropisms come as one tongue does its best to acknowledge another. Which in this pleasant second-best gathering often yields wisdom -- intentional or accidental. ""Theres no present like the time"" says more than one character. Having established a winning communal atmosphere at the rundown but charming Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur India young proprietor Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) needs to expand. We learn from the daily morning roll call that the guests like their accommodations so much that very few of them have left. So we find Sonny and co-manager Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) zipping along scenic Route 66 toward San Diego to meet with a hotel group specializing in accommodations for the AARP crowd. The two make an amusing tag team the overly enthusiastic pup accompanied by the kind of older pooch who barely looks up when she growls. The hotel group honcho (David Strathairn) cant quite hide his amusement even behind his salt-and-pepper beard. At the same time Sonny plots this new addition fiancee Sunaina (Tina Desai) is back in Jaipur planning their upcoming nuptials. Sonny proves a loving but distracted groom-to-be. In addition to Muriel most of the Brit pensioners are happily hunkered down Judi Denchs Evelyn has become a freelance fabric buyer for a British concern. The brow-beaten Douglas (Bill Nighy) pines after her. You may recall unpleasant wife Carol (Penelope Wilton) high-tailed it back home. Madge (Celia Imrie) swings between two attentive suitors while Norman and Carols fledging relationship has become just routine enough to give the former playboy reservations. Directed by John Madden the original sleeper discovered a wide-awake audience when it debuted in 2012. For the record I saw that movie near Sun City Ariz. where last weeks llama drama unfolded. My then-85-year-old mom and I made our way up the stairs to the last row in a matinee crowded with the perfect and game demographic. That year ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" was part of a pop-culture parade that was taking an updated gander at aging. So quickly have we become accustomed to frisky ideas about seniors desire and the post-retirement life that when new guest Guy (Richard Gere) arrives the book hes at work on about growing older will strike most as glum and boneheaded. Only Sonny believes Guys actually the hotel inspector sent by his potential investors. Bending over backward to please Guy Sonny neglects another guest (Tamsin Greig) whos checking out the properties on behalf of her aging mum. In slighting one to court the other Sonny creates havoc and no small bit of intrigue for his widowed mother (Lillete Dubey). Additional tension comes by way of Kush (Shazad Latif) a handsome friend of Sunainas family that Sonny fears is a rival. Romantic miscues abound. Mistaken identity comes into play. And Madden and writer Ol Parker enjoy gently sampling some movies sure to nudge the memories of its Greatest Gen and early Boomer audience like smart crossword puzzle clues. Theres a ""Stranger On a Train"" subplot. Theres a sweetly subtle nod to the final moments in ""The Philadelphia Story."" With Smith Dench and Nighy the cast really is expert. And Patel is swift with a phrase even if Sonnys a bit of a dunderhead Sure it has the comfy vibe of the familiar but its all in feel-good fun.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 6 2015 Save for later Saved Madge (Celia Imrie) Norman (Ronald Pickup) Carol (Diana Hardcastle) Evelyn (Judi Dench) Muriel (Maggie Smith) and Douglas (Bill Nighy) cavort in The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Laurie Sparham/Fox Searchlight Films/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The surprise success of ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" has inevitably given us ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" its all too aptly titled sequel. Its a diminution of what was already rather diminutive the first go-round.What I liked about the first film was in a sense extracurricular It demonstrated that a movie about oldsters could be commercially boffo. It featured a gaggle of retired Brits who for sundry reasons retreat to Jaipur India and find a measure of happiness living in a shabby-chic hotel. It certainly didnt hurt that the Brits were played by such luminaries as Maggie Smith Judi Dench Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy. They gave the film a full octave range of feeling when considerably less was called for.The sequel directed like its predecessor by John Madden and written by Ol Parker picks up the story after several years. Except for the character played by Wilkinson whose death closed out the last film all the regulars have returned. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Muriel (Smith) with Sonny (Dev Patel) is now co-manager of the hotel. Evelyn (Dench) is developing a textile business. Douglas (Nighy) with whom she shares a still undeclared love is a local (and hilariously inept) tour guide. Madge (Celia Imrie) is still on the prowl for men and has two maharajahs in her sights. Norman (Ronald Pickup) and Carol (Diana Hardcastle) are struggling to maintain monogamy. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The film begins with Sonny and Muriel attempting in their temperamentally polar ways to convince a San Diego hotel magnate (David Strathairn) to fund a second Exotic Marigold in Jaipur as the kickoff to a full-fledged Indian franchise. Intrigued but wary he enlists an undercover hotel inspector to survey the situation in Jaipur. When two guests check in - Guy (Richard Gere) an American who claims to be a novelist and Lavinia (Tasmin Greig) a Brit scouting places she says to ensconce her mother - Sonny immediately assumes that Guy is the inspector and kowtows to him outrageously to the point where he neglects his upcoming nuptials to his demanding fiancee Sunaina (Tina Desai). Guy meanwhile takes an instant shine to Sonnys steely mother Mrs. Kapoor (Lillette Dubey). Were supposed to think hes smitten but to me he looked like a grifter on the make.To its credit the film doesnt unduly play up the Raj angle. These aging Anglos are enswooned by India and for the most part are humbled by its phantasmagoric bustle. Asian actors get almost as much screen time as white actors. At the same time the India of this movie is essentially an ersatz confection We see almost nothing of dire poverty or political distress and of course we are treated in the end to a spangly wedding complete with a Bollywood-style finale. (At times the film seems like an outreach of Indias tourism bureau.) I wouldnt make mention of these absences if the film at other points wasnt attempting to get all serious on us. We are for example primed for at least one of the regulars to expire; the film teases us continually about who if anyone that might be.The gravitas of the Wilkinson scenes in the first film was well earned. This remains true of the sequences here involving Smith. It would have been very easy for her to coast through this movie. Thats the wonderful thing about great actors - they can turn gush into gold.Another thing I suppose we should be thankful for None of the codgers turns into a superhero. Im still getting over the sight of Colin Firth - not as old as these folks but getting up there - doing his ninja moves in ""Kingsman."" If Hollywood must have franchises we could do worse than one highlighting people who have lived a long life and are not on altogether friendly terms with technology. But imagine what this cast could do with something less tutti-frutti Grade B- (Rated PG for some language and suggestive comments.)

The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (PG) The gangs all here in this so-so sequel to the charming 2011 comedy. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com3/5/2015 Editor rating 2.5 The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is exactly that -- second best. A sequel was inevitable after the success of the first Marigold Hotel film a charming comedy-drama based on a novel about a group of British senior citizens who retire to India and experience various forms of culture shock. There are enough engaging moments to keep the new film from being a total bust -- it stars the wonderful Judi Dench and Bill Nighy after all and an elegant silver Richard Gere also makes an appearance. But you cant shake the feeling the script is trying too hard to please upping the drama despite the fact that what made the first film so enjoyable was its relative simplicity. As the movie opens ambitious proprietor Sonny (Dev Patel) and prickly bookkeeper Muriel (Maggie Smith) are heading across Route 66 in the U.S. on their way to a business meeting. Sonnys plan is to expand his senior citizen home empire to include a second hotel just in time for his marriage to Sunaina (Tina Desai). This development provides a tiresome plotline Although he should be helping with the upcoming nuptials Sonny is distracted by finances instead of involved in the wedding planning. Hes also unreasonably jealous of the handsome old friend who actually is bothering to help Sunaina with her preparations. The bright-eyed insanely positive entrepreneur has been replaced by a pouty petulant whiner a character shift that makes no sense unless screenwriter Ol Parker was desperate to manufacture conflict. Meanwhile things are only slightly calmer among the hotel guests in India. Evelyn (Judi Dench) has used her sharp eye to land a new position that allows her to travel all over the country to buy fabric but her potential romance with the newly single but still shy Douglas (Bill Nighy) remains at a frustrating standstill. Sexy Madge (Celia Imrie) has the opposite problem Shes got one lover too many and may be forced to choose between two men she is beginning to realize she doesnt want. Norman (Ronald Pickup) is sharing a bed with Carol (Diana Hardcastle) but wonders if he should weasel out of monogamy when there are so many comely ex-pats available to him. In what turns out to be the silliest and least interesting diversion in the movie he starts to believe he has inadvertently put out a hit on Carol and spends a great deal of time running around trying to chase down her would-be assassin. The whirl of romance amid the older generation is generally delightful though especially when Douglas estranged wife (Peneope Wilton) reappears on the scene. The addition of Gere -- who may or may not be spying on the hotel finances in light of the American investment -- is more than welcome (although Richard Gere checking into a hotel for the elderly is more than a little unnerving for those of us who fondly remember his American Gigolo days). Director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) ends on an upbeat note -- a glorious Indian wedding -- to remind us to revel in every joy life offers. Even if you dont revel in every moment of this movie.

Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The continuing stories of several elderly British expatriates in India. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE A feeble follow-up to the 2012 original. CAST Judi Dench Bill Nighy Dev Patel Richard Gere LENGTH 202 In 2012 ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" aimed for a box-office demographic that most studios had abandoned. The story of seven British seniors who find second chances at life after checking into a dilapidated Indian hotel the film looked as regal as a Merchant-Ivory production but had the thematic heft of a Hugh Grant rom-com. The combination proved a hit. ""Marigold"" earned 136.8 million proving that actors in their 60s and 70s could still resonate with audiences. It helped that those actors including Judi Dench and Bill Nighy were some of the finest around. Returning director John Madden reassembles them in the follow-up ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" in which the Marigolds enthusiastic young owner Sonny (Dev Patel) attempts to open a second property. The cast is joined by Richard Gere as an American silver fox who falls for Sonnys mother (Lillete Dubey) but none of them can save this shallow hollow feebleminded sequel. advertisement | advertise on newsday In an attempt to create new problems for his old characters (originated by Deborah Moggach in her novel ""These Foolish Things"") screenwriter Ol Parker inadvertently makes them all unlikable. Gold-digging Madge (Celia Imrie) spends alternate nights with two Indian suitors. Freewheeling Norman (Ronald Pickup) fears that he has accidentally ordered a hit on his girlfriend Carol (Diana Hardcastle) easily the films dopiest contrivance. Denchs Evelyn whom we last saw riding a motorbike with Nighys Douglas is now inexplicably hesitant about him. Perhaps thats because the once-endearing Douglas has somehow become a harebrained bore. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviewsMore coverageRafer Guzmans latest Any film that cant make good use of Nighy an actor whose shrewd intelligence shines through even in dreck like ""Underworld Rise of the Lycans"" is doing something dreadfully wrong. Patel also grates as the increasingly manic Sonny although Tina Desai as his fiancee helps soften his edges. As for the great Maggie Smith her role as the cranky Muriel Donnelly is ossifying into shtick. The first film at least addressed the specter of death among these aging expatriates but the sequel seems more afraid of the subject. Thats probably because the studio is loath to rule out ""The Third Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.""

Call it ""Nifty Shades of Grey."" Except as a movie ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" - and Im sorry didnt they know this joke was coming when they chose that cutesy title? - is yes definitely second-best. Maybe even third. The set-up if you remember is that a number of British retirees hoping to stretch their pensions have relocated to a hotel in Jaipur. The accommodations are meagre but the young hotelier is eager -- and warmed by the sun the elders begin to pair off romantically. There were and are still two good things about this. The first is that - even though in this film as in the last mortality looms - its not really a story about infirmity or death. Thats a rarity in Hollywood in which once you see more than two characters over 60 you know the film is largely going to take place in a hospital. The second is that it has parts for a number of marvelous older actors including the great Maggie Smith superb Judi Dench delicious Bill Nighy and wry Celia Imrie. (And building on the last film Dench 80 even gets to do a bit of cradle-robbing by heating up that romance with Nighy 65. You go girl Er Dame.) But the same problems as the first film also re-occur and this time theyre a bit more glaring. Dev Patel continues to be extraordinarily annoying - loud bumbling insistent and full of more stereotypical obsequiousness than the worst of Peter Sellers cringe-worthy impressions. Hes an embarrassment from start to finish. And the screenplay by Ol Parker who also wrote the first one is as overcomplicated as one of those 10.95 buffets that promises all-you-can-eat but then offers little you really want to. Once again there are too many characters and too many predictable subplots. Will Dench and Nighy conquer their own tongue-tied uncertainty and hesitance? Will Patel successfully juggle both his upcoming nuptials and his hoped-for business expansion? Which gentleman will very busy ultra-cougar (tiger?) Imrie finally choose? Lets just say there arent many surprises. Of course there is that cast. Dench is as luminous as she ever was and Nighy is so elegant he seems to be wearing a double-breasted suit even when he isnt. And no film with Smith - she of the coldly fishy gaze and icy retort - is ever truly worthless. Theres also the added bonus of silver fox Richard Gere who makes an appearance. (And yes - yes - apparently now Richard Gere 65 is old enough to guest-star in retirement-home movies. You may all mourn your own lost youth later.) But its not just that arent any fresh dishes here - its that everything feels as if its been reheating on the steam tables all day. Its the same story as the first one retold but minus Tom Wilkinson and with even more Dev Patel. And thats a meal I can happily skip. Ratings note The film contains some mildly suggestive material. The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (PG) Fox Searchlight (122 min.) Directed by John Madden. With Judi Dench Bill Nighy Maggie Smith Dev Patel Richard Gere. Now playing in New Jersey.

Douglas (Bill Nighy) is still pining for Evelyn (Judi Dench) Norman and Carol (Ronald Pickup Diana Hardcastle) are trying to settle into a steady thing and Madge (Celia Imrie) is looking for love in various places. And the imperious Muriel (the imperious Maggie Smith) now co-manages the hotel. So theres more of all that which will probably please fans.Whats new is Sonny is now getting married to girlfriend Sunaina (Tina Desai). Unfortunately hes being distracted from his duties as a groom by the fact that hes trying to open a second hotel and a potential backer is sending an anonymous hotel inspector to check out the Best Exotic. When two new guests arrive (Richard Gere and Tamsin Greig) Sonny immediately assumes the male is the inspector and bends over backwards trying to please him while ignoring the female.The big problem here is Sonnys character which has devolved from optimist to full-on fool. Theres something more than a bit disquieting about seeing an Indian character in India played out as such a complete Bozo especially while surrounded by sympathetic white folk. If a black character was played this broadly in an American setting people would rightfully be screaming. As a result this hotel isnt near as comfy as the first.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongThe Second Best Exotic Marigold HotelGRADE C-Rated PG for some language and suggestive commentsRunning time 122 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1G4DdGv MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/03/06/second-best-marigold-hotel-indeed-second-best/24452579/,200,thesecondbestexoticmarigoldhotel10,thesecondbestexoticmarigoldhotel,detroitnews

Even in second place however this colourful sequel is still a charming follow-up to the surprise hit movie from 2012. Returning to the now rejuvenated retirement hotel in India where a group of eccentric British seniors has decided to settle in it picks up more or less where the last movie left off. Without much drama but with a lot of character detail layered in it moves the quirky story forward. For mobile users click this link I agree with John Madden who was in the directors chair for both that the two Exotic Marigold movies now constitute one complete story arc. That has now become true even if it was never planned that way. And even if the 2004 novel that inspired the first movie Deborah Moggachs These Foolish Things did not go this far in the saga. But a third instalment (as has been idly suggested) would strain credulity. Two is quite enough -- and quite a lovely way to spend time at the cinema and/or at home when both become available together on DVD Blu-ray or digital download. Almost all of the original cast returns with the obvious exception of Tom Wilkinson. So we reunite with the two 80-year-old Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith along with Bill Nighy Penelope Wilton Diana Hardcastle Celia Imrie Donald Pickup Lillete Dubey and the young romantic couple played by Dev Patel and Tena Desae. Because I found the original movie so engaging I enjoyed finding out what has happened and what is to come in the lives of these characters. While the wedding plans for Patel and Desae give the story its tenuous through-line that is not really the point. Nor is the subplot about a second venue Patel wants to open to expand his mini-empire as a hotelier. Instead think about how few movies tell an upbeat if bittersweet story about seniors. The Exotic Marigold movies offer a welcome break from the concerns of the young and from the comic book superheroes who occupy our theatres. For mobile users click this link That leaves me fascinated when Dench and Nighy try to negotiate a love relationship so late in life for their characters. Advanced age does not make emotional longing and sexual desire any less potent especially when these sentiments and situations are explored by actors as skilled as Dench and Nighy. As for others in the sequel Smiths crusty character also has significant moments when she is exploring issues of physical vulnerability and mortality. Meanwhile key newcomers Richard Gere and Tamsin Greig slide effortlessly into the proceedings fresh breezes in the warm Indian weather. Gere in particular adds value when his character has a cross-cultural romantic frisson with Dubey (who plays Patels sardonic mother). I do not want to oversell The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel as a five-star establishment -- because it is not -- but I do recommend you check in and enjoy your stay.

"Review The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel overstays its welcome - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel overstays its welcome Review The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel overstays its welcome Laurie Sparham AP ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" gets by on the sheer charm of its talented cast. ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" gets by on the sheer charm of its talented cast. (Laurie Sparham AP) Mark OlsenContact Reporter Review The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel feels like a cobbled-together return to scene of first film Honestly when a sequel is called ""Second Best"" the joke is just right there waiting. And so when it turns out that ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is in fact a lesser follow-up to its surprise 2012 hit predecessor it tests ones sense of restraint not to go right for the obvious puns.It was often noted that ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" about a group of British retirees living in India was like an aging ""Avengers"" for the way it brought together an all-star cast of acting talent. In this sequel the director inadvertently continues that inside joke by making something that feels obligatory and cobbled together like a late franchise entry. The film has only the sheer charm of its cast to get it by and it says a lot about the actors that they nearly pull it off. Muriel (Maggie Smith) is co-managing the hotel with the more enthusiastic than wise Sonny (Dev Patel) and as the film opens the two are attempting to expand in partnership with an American company. Evelyn (Judi Dench) and Douglas (Bill Nighy) are tentatively forging a relationship together while the romantic complications of their other neighbors swirl around them. New to the mix is Richard Gere as a charmingly mysterious Richard Gere-type a soulful silver fox.The first ""Best Exotic"" film was adapted from the novel ""These Foolish Things""; the new film has the unwieldy credit of ""characters created in Deborah Moggachs original novel."" The screen story is credited to Madden and Ol Parker with the screenplay by Parker. So in a sense the new film is fan fiction of the original from the start akin to later James Bond films when producers had run out of original stories to adapt. This could explain why the characters all seem to be flailing about unsure of what to do. Dench often seems to wander alone through the film in what is intended as a series of missed connections with Nighys character but plays more like some kind of scheduling issue they were trying to work around.

See more videos The first film had some basis in the idea of retirees outsourcing their retirements to India looking to stretch whatever money they had. This gave the story a grounded connection to the here-and-now which the new film sorely lacks. David Strathairn as head of an elder-focused chain of hotels who is a potential partner is underutilized as is any implied tension between small boutique hotels and larger chains.Shot in the northern state of Rajasthan its not even that the film is patronizing to the Indian locations and culture -- it just sort of ignores them aside from background colors boisterous parties and funny cab rides. By the time it all ends predictably with a faux Bollywood-style dance number even the goofy kick of seeing Richard Gere doing air guitar has been muted. The first ""Exotic Marigold"" was like a pleasant package vacation delivering solid and reliable service but this return feels like a trip thats gone on too long.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday March 5 2015 Follow AnnHornaday The notorious larcenist known as Maggie Smith continues her diabolical spree of serial scene-stealing in ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" a strident over-plotty sequel to the 2012 surprise hit about a group of aging British ex-pats who move into a charming Jaipur inn to reinvent their golden years. The ""Second Best"" installment finds Smiths character Mrs. Donnelly racing down Route 66 in a snazzy Mustang with her Marigold co-manager Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) on a quest to find corporate underwriting for their next adventure in elder-hostelry. Asked how she liked America upon her return to India Mrs. Donnelly dryly quips ""I went with low expectations and came back disappointed."" Such are the withering asides delivered with lethal aim that make ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" a fun if fitfully amusing diversion despite being overlong and overloaded with mixed messages misapprehensions and myriad predictable story lines. Once again directed by John Madden from a script by Ol Parker the ""Second Best"" chapter seems aimed at upping the ante in sheer volume and busyness constantly whipsawing viewers from one characters arc to anothers. Will Madge (Celia Imrie) finally settle down with one of her two affluent affectionate suitors? Will Norman and Carol (Ronald Pickup and Diana Hardcastle) finally get the hang of monogamy? Will Doug (Bill Nighy) and Evelyn (Judi Dench) stop hemming and hawing and hook up already? This fine ensemble of actors manages to enliven even those low stakes with honesty vulnerability and welcome doses of sex appeal -- which also goes for the rep companys newcomer Richard Gere who exudes easy spontaneous warmth as a last-minute Marigold guest. The putative engine thats driving the action is Sonnys engagement to Sunaina (Tina Desai) and their impending nuptials -- how else to include the Bollywood dance routine thats now de rigeur for a film set in India? But the narrative tension that ensues is as weak as the American tea Mrs. Donnelly abhors and Patels overly ingratiating performance quickly palls. Just as with the first movie what makes the ""Second Best"" version work at all are the actors older than 35 as well as the splendid scenery and vibrant material culture that shimmers with light color and rich textures. Those elements come to life especially when Evelyn walks the Jaipur marketplace in search of fabrics as part of a new job ""liaising"" between local artisans and an importer. Most of the Marigold residents have embarked on rewarding new chapters finding renewed purpose and meaning in careers romances and philosophical reckonings. Its no wonder that the ""Exotic Marigold"" movies have found such love and loyalty from its underserved audience of older filmgoers Sure its pat and occasionally patronizing and too adorable by half but its also a rare optimistic portrait of aging that suggests it can be a productive erotically charged time of life. Thanks to its funny attractive emotionally on-point cast ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" puts the lie to F. Scott Fitzgeralds pronouncement about life having no second acts. In fact it goes one step further to question why on Earth anyone would stop at just two. The nuptials of Sonny (Dev Patel) and Sunaina (Tina Desai) are celebrated with a big Bollywood dance routine.

Laurie Sparham/Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Laurie Sparham/Fox Searchlight Celia Imrie Ronald Pickup Diana Hardcastle Judi Dench Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy in The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Laurie Sparham/Fox Searchlight After The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel a comedy about a group of British pensioners who take an eccentric travel package to Jaipur India became a surprise hit in 2012 we now have a return trip. The most admirable thing about The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the nose-thumbing delight it takes in turning counterprogramming for seniors into a Hangover-like franchise with legs. Why make another one? Well maybe because Judi Dench Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith wanted another trip to India and Richard Gere wanted to pay a visit and the movie is giving them lead roles instead of shoving them into the token-elder corner and isnt that reason enough? Maybe for them but director John Maddens return to this quirky destination ""for the elderly and beautiful"" doesnt give the rest of us much incentive to check in. The film follows Sonny (Dev Patel) the Best Exotics ambitious proprietor with a penchant for jumbling English sayings (""Theres no present like the time"") as he attempts to expand his hospitality franchise. Sonny is the only character given any forward momentum His now-permanent guests having attained enlightenment in the first film seem so aware of their borrowed time that theyre reluctant to find more character flaws for India to fix. The poster couple widow Evelyn (Dench) and unhappily married Douglas (Nighy) were together at the first films conclusion; yet here their relationship status is back to Facebook-complicated. Lovebirds Norman and Carol (Ronald Pickup and Diana Hardcastle) are killing time with screwball misunderstandings. Madge (Celia Imrie) a frisky single who will make a pass at any man glancing her way tries to settle down. And Muriel (Smith) the reformed racist turned co-manager of the hotel putters around making wisecracks. Gere as a shifty new arrival named Guy may or may not be an undercover inspector sent by a potential investor. But either way hes Pretty Woman heartthrob Richard Gere in a popcorn movie for the AARP set and his tired performance reflects this. Even in the pit of its formula the first Exotic Marigold achieved moments of poignancy by asking two giant questions (1) Is it possible to live out ones golden years with reinvigoration and good humor and (2) What is the culturally responsible way to travel to an unfamiliar country? Madden and his co-screenwriter Ol Parker applied pressure to Merchant-Ivory road pictures while still making the film a straightforward crowd-pleaser. Second Best which Parker also scripted comes closest to rekindling this spirit during a brief Mumbai getaway. Evelyn offered an executive job with a fabric company at the age of 79 has to show shes aware enough to haggle with Indias best capitalists. Reappearing is Douglass estranged wife Jean (the wonderfully acid Penelope Wilton) who became the franchise heel by refusing to engage with the surrounding culture. Shes staying in the posh accommodations she always wanted the kind of hotel conceived to homogenize travel for people like her (theres a funny wide shot of her lounging in the glass-encased lobby). Its a welcome deviation from Western entertainments penchant for smirking at foreign dirt. The Mumbai passage exists at odds with a litany of poor decisions chief among them an expanded role for Sonny. Patels performance in this series with his exaggerated accent wild gesticulations and eager entrepreneurialism is the stuff of sociology classes - is he subverting stereotypes or encouraging them? But either way the character is obnoxious. He treats most of his guests with contempt is openly hostile to his mother (a big no-no for this movies intended audience) and has more chemistry with the self-portrait that hangs above his front desk than he does with his gorgeous fiance (Tina Desai). Their wedding plans feature prominently into the story which demands Sonnys unearned late-period redemption. An Indian fusion dance sequence is our reward for slogging through this test of patience. Good on the Marigold team for creating unlikely franchise fare and for resisting the temptation to coddle the mystique of their ""exotic"" setting. But any fear of cultural imperialism has been replaced with imperialism of dullness. Idea for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Third Charms The Time Since there has to be a formula anyway just make a Bollywood musical starring Britains finest. That at least could be fun to watch.

(Laurie Sparham) A movie review of ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" The originals all-star cast returns in this ""second best"" film about British senior citizens who opt for a cheap hotel in India. Rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times How do you approach a sequel that includes ""second best"" in the title? Its not exactly suggesting originality. The title promises more of the same -- and thats exactly what were in the market for this time. Too bad it misses the lighter-than-air quality that kept the original from becoming a slog. The plot doesnt help either. The storyline of the sequel ends up tying itself in knots and the addition of a splashy expensive-looking Bollywood musical number just underlines the lack of perspective. Three years ago ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" became a minor box-office success thanks largely to an all-star cast of senior citizens who knew precisely how to deliver on the promise of this latest variation on the ""Grand Hotel"" formula. Movie Review    The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Judi Dench Dev Patel Richard Gere Bill Nighy Maggie Smith Penelope Wilton. Directed by John Madden from a screenplay by Ol Parker. 122 minutes. Rated PG for language suggestive comments. Several theaters. The sequel begins much like the first film in which bouncy resourceful Sonny (Dev Patel) demonstrated his talent for resurrecting a rundown Indian hotel and luring British retirees to sign up for his lower rates. This time hes adding another hotel and dealing with the consequences which include a foxy new guest (Richard Gere). Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Also held over from the first film are director John Madden who directed Dench to an Oscar-winning performance in ""Shakespeare in Love"" and screenwriter Ol Parker. Madden provides plenty of local color and he draws good performances from Dench and Wilton but Nighy and Gere are allowed to drown in self-pity.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The return visit to the Exotic Marigold Hotel is like a reunion with familiar acquaintances. Or for the pensioners who flocked like pigeons to the original lifting the wee 10 million production to a 137 million international hit a homecoming with old friends. If news of the sequel made you reminisce about the halcyon days of summer 2012 your hope is rewarded. However if Judi Dench lights your fire hotter by ordering James Bond to kill people than acting ladylike and heartwarming this is the opposite of nostalgia. The main characters are the same crew of retired Brits who originally moved to a Jaipur boardinghouse tired of England illness and ennui. Some are decent but boring others channel the romantic urges and sexual energy of their youth. All revel in their absence from the UK and are beginning to recoup their sense of self. The storys essential focus is everyones choice of whom to woo. The exceptions are Sonny (ever-enjoyable Dev Patel) the aspiring and very chatty manager of the ramshackle hotel and Muriel (zippy Maggie Smith) who began the last film as a bigoted Cockney resident and now is a crucial pillar of strength in his business dealings. Sonny is set to marry his charming fiancee Sunaina (Tina Desai) if she is able to resist the flirtation of a handsome self-aggrandizing rival entrepreneur. Muriel is focused on matriarchal duties with a needy local family she loves although they cant communicate. The hardworking new partners open the film with Sonnys efforts to convince an American company that a second location for his guesthouse can win scads of mature travelers. The CEO promises to invest if a secret visitor files a glowing review. The real purpose of the meeting though is to give Patel and Smith a chance to show off their comic double act he spouting oddball business adages while she harangues her hosts with complaints about insipid American tea. Back in India everyone has a subplot or two to deal with. With financial support on the horizon Sonny sidetracks his wedding planning much to his girlfriends annoyance. The widowed Evelyn (Dench) buying local textiles for international trade seems to have more on her mind than her bumbling mumbling hesitant swain Douglas (Bill Nighy) South Asias least-competent tourist guide. A pair of wealthy admirers are competing for attention from the once lonely Madge (Celia Imrie). Playboy Norman (Ronald Pickup) has at last found the woman of his dreams Carol (Diana Hardcastle) but frantically investigates every tuk-tuk cab in town fearful that he has unintentionally ordered a driver to run over his darling. The romance thickens with the arrival of a debonair new guest novelist Guy Chambers (Richard Gere). Might he be the investors inspector and if so could Sonny fix him up with his lovely widowed mother (Lillete Dubey) to nail the deal? Photos by 20th Century Fox Ronald Pickup Diana Hardcastle Judi Dench Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy are back in ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" A sequel to a surprise hit isnt about to muddle its popular formula. Director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") who wrote the script with Ol Parker makes ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" a straight-up follow-up faithful as a fawning grandparent. Like Sonny and his imagined hotel empire the filmmakers are pursuing franchise dreams. The dialogue is crammed with more jokes about the pensioners broadly teased for having ""checked out"" or ""like lemmings come to the cliff edge that is the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" For those laughing at the breakfast-hour roll calls to make sure no one passed on overnight the new jokes are just that much more fun. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The reviews ranged from indulgent to unkind--mine fell into the latter category--but the film appealed so strongly to its target audience that a sequel was inevitable. ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is another upbeat fairy tale set for the most part in the same picturesque precincts of Jaipur and directed like the original by John Madden.

Evelyn (Judi Dench) and Douglas (Bill Nighy) return for another stay in The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.(Photo Laurie Sparham Fox Searchlight Pictures)The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is more like a serving of lukewarm treacle than savory tikka masala.Like its affable 2012 predecessor this sequel (1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) is set mostly in Jaipur India. While some characters in the ensemble cast are likable and given ample range a few are reduced to placeholder status and a couple are stuck in randy-oldster mode. The message is clear Their lives are far from over as they begin this rich new chapter. If only they werent shoehorned into such simplistic scenarios.The story is predictable and tries too hard to to match up most of the aging players in neat romantic pairings.A quick refresher on the original Best Exotic Marigold Hotel A group of British seniors leave their familiar surroundings in the U.K. to outsource"" their retirement. They take up residence in a colorful somewhat dilapidated hotel in India that bills itself as catering to the ""elderly and beautiful.""The pensioners are played by a whos who of veteran actors most of whom return for the sequel along with key Indian actors and a few new players. Much of the dialogue given to Madge (Celia Imrie) is hubba-hubba style innuendo. Ditto for old Norman (Ronald Pickup) as he struggles with an exclusive relationship with Carol (Diana Hardcastle) while each is pursued by other interested parties.At least screenwriter Ol Parker gives the engaging 79-year-old Evelyn (Judi Dench) a challenging job that requires travel and sharp negotiating skills as well as a charming suitor in Douglas (Bill Nighy). Running parallel to the experiences of the lively Brits is the story of overseer Sonny (Dev Patel) a young entrepreneur known for his over-the-top flowery language and unorthodox hotel-management style.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare As the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has only a single remaining vacancy - posing a rooming predicament for two fresh arrivals - Sonny pursues his expansionist dream of opening a second hotel. VPCWhile Patel is generally an appealing actor his role has been amplified to that of an unctuous motor-mouth that grows grating. He does have some funny moments with co-manager Muriel (Maggie Smith) who assists him with his dream of expanding to a second hotel.Much of the movie has Sonny and his beleaguered fiancee Sunaina (Tina Desai) locked in arguments stemming from his sense of jealousy over her handsome and suave family friend Kushal (Shazad Latif.)Speaking of suave newcomer Richard Gere plays the mysterious Guy Chambers who has come to India to write a novel. He takes an instant shine to Sonnys mother Mrs. Kapoor (Lillete Dubey). Sonny meanwhile is a nervous wreck focused far more on his business than on his impending nuptials much to the annoyance of his fiancee.Sonny is convinced that Guy is a secret emissary sent by the investors he approached about expanding to a second hotel. Consequently Sonny trips all over himself to be solicitous.Though the upbeat Bollywood dance finale is an undeniable treat this sequel is a mildly diverting trifle notable for its stunning setting and some deft performances but crammed with too many forgettable subplots. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1BLY4PF",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/05/the-second-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-review/24359545/,200,thesecondbestexoticmarigoldhotel20,thesecondbestexoticmarigoldhotel,usatoday

Comments click to enlarge The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Video Rated PG  122 minutes  2015 Fox Searchlights geezer rom-com The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012) grossed some 46 million an impressive take for a niche-market release so here comes the pointless sequel. The action resumes at the same decrepit hotel in Jaipur India where a collection of acerbic Brits (Maggie Smith Bill Nighy Judi Dench Celia Imrie) have chosen to spend their twilight years--though Tom Wilkinson whose character in the first movie was by far the most interesting has moved on ceding his place in the ensemble to silver-haired Richard Gere. The most memorable plotline in which the Indian owner (Dev Patel) sucks up to a guest he thinks is a hotel inspector seems to have been filched from an episode of Fawlty Towers. John Madden returns as director; with Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey) and David Strathairn. By J.R.

But they wont. So when they show up together in a movie even a sequel as wobbly as The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel youd be wise to just sit back and behold. Second Best -- hows that for truth in advertising? -- is basically the same movie as the 2012 original without the novelty. Its still about British seniors seeking a retirement haven in India. But the follow-up only exists because the original hit the box-office sweet spot. Hollywood which traditionally ignores the interests of seniors -- hell make that adults in general -- saw a new audience to exploit. More News 10 Best Movies of 2014 Fifty Shades of Gag Peter Travers on Februarys Worst Films Rob Sheffield on Downton Abbey Real Housewives of the 1920s All Stories >> Related 2015 Preview 68 Reasons This Year Will Rule The smash albums blockbuster movies and water-cooler TV shows to watch out for over the next 12 months So the old gang has been rounded up for another go. Dont worry. It only sounds like codger cattle-prodding. Director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) knows his job is basically to juggle the cliches in Ol Parkers script. But his affection for his cast is genuine. So is ours. Instead of going gentle into that good night the seniors at the Marigold in Jaipur are actually spreading their wings. Evelyn (Dench) at 79 becomes a buyer of  exotic fabrics. Douglas (Nighy) is a charmingly clueless tour guide whos trying to seduce Evelyn since his wife Jean (Wilton) has left him. And Muriel (Smith) has agreed to  co-manage the hotel with dithering Sonny (Dev Patel) who wants to expand now that hes about to marry his fiancee (Tina Desai). That sends Muriel and Sonny to the U.S. to hustle financing from an investor (David Strathairn) who sends an inspector to India to spy on the operation. Is that spy silver-haired charmer Guy Chambers (Richard Gere)? Ill never tell. But theres no denying that Gere spices up the proceedings especially when he takes a shine to Sonnys mom (Lillete Dubey). Madden throws everything he can at the screen including a Bollywood wedding and the spectre of death. He neednt have bothered. Its delicious to watch Dame Maggie aim a zinger (""Just because Im looking at you when you talk dont think Im listening or even interested""). And Dench and Nighy are class personified. The secret here is merely to luxuriate in the pleasure of their company. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

"The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is worth checking in to again review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is worth checking in to again review The outstanding cast of senior actors plus Richard Gere are back for The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. March 5 2015The Second Best Exotic Marigold HotelStarring Maggie Smith Judi Dench Richard Gere Bill Nighy Dev Patel Celia Imrie Diana Hardcastle Lillete Dubey and Ronald Pickup. Directed by John Madden. 122 minutes. Opening March 6 at major theatres. PGIts turned out to be a busy retirement for the golden agers who captured hearts and massive box office with The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel four years ago.Theyre all back and happily living loving -- and working various jobs -- in colourful Jaipur for the equally busily titled The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.Article Continued BelowStill at the helm is ambitious hotel manager Sonny (Dev Patel) whose boundless enthusiasm about all things now includes a dream to expand his single location into an empire.Richard Gere having a drink with Lillette Dubey is a new guest in the Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.He has a business partner trying to help him realize that while keeping his emotional excesses in check -- and an unlikely one at that. Waspish Muriel Donnelly (Downton Abbeys Maggie Smith) has had a change of heart about many things and is now co-managing the ramshackle hotel where a morning roll call determines if anybody has checked out permanently.As the film opens Muriel and Sonny are in L.A. seeking an American partner for a second hotel. Meanwhile back in Jaipur the various couples who found new lives and each other when they moved into the Marigold in retirement are dealing with complications that have a teen romance ring.Evelyn (Judi Dench) still isnt able to commit to the clearly pining Douglas (Bill Nighy) now that hes free of nitpicking ex-wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) but neither has the nerve to broach the subject. Madge (Celia Imrie) is juggling wealthy suitors unable to make up her mind. And while Carol (Diana Hardcastle) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) outwardly seem OK somethings not right.Enter Richard Gere as travelling novelist Guy Chambers having aged well at age 65 from American Gigolo to become the (relatively) young catnip for the Marigold set. Sonny is convinced hes the hotel inspector the Yanks said they would send in advance of funding his new hotel and that sends his usual obsequiousness into high gear.If Sonny is hardly happy that Guy seems smitten with his elegant mom (Lillete Dubey) he can encourage a flirtation if thats what is required to get a positive rating. After all Sonny has a lot on his mind with pending wedding to Sunaina (Tina Desai) and his hotel expansion both imperiled by handsome business tycoon and slick dancer Kush (Shazad Latif).If it sounds like a busy plot you aint seen nothing yet. And thats the biggest detraction of this attraction where returning screenwriter Ol Parker occasionally overwhelms with multiple plot points and a dozen tiny dramas.Director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) is also back seeking to recapture the box-office bonanza enjoyed by the 2011 film.""How many new lives can we have?"" says Evelyn.

Maggie Smith returns as Muriel in ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" Photo HANDOUT / Laurie Sparham / Fox Searchlight Pictures Review A little busy but still second best Marigold Hotel 1 / 3 Back to Gallery John Madden is one lucky man. As the director of ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" the charming but uneven sequel to the 2011 film Madden once again has an all-star British cast at his disposal led by Judi Dench Maggie Smith and (my favorite) Bill Nighy. And ... oh what the heck ... lets throw American Richard Gere in there just for good measure. The acting of course is first rate and the movie mostly preserves the warmth and wit of the original. But the many confusing story lines never really come together and were ultimately left with a pleasant but unsatisfying soap opera. The story begins with Sonny (Dev Patel) and Muriel (Smith) traveling to San Diego to meet with a group of potential investors. Sonny the can-do entrepreneur of the Best Marigold Hotel in Jaipur India needs cash to open a second hotel. At the same time Sonny and Sunaina (Tina Desai) are planning their wedding an effort made more complicated by Sonnys business ambition. Meanwhile Douglas (Nighy) and Evelyn (Dench) continue their maybe-we-should maybe-we-shouldnt relationship. Guy (Gere) a new guest is writing a novel but Sonny suspects Guy is really an inspector sent by the potential investors to evaluate the hotel. But Guy seems to be more interested in pursuing Sonnys mother (Lillete Dubey). Madge (Celia Imrie) is trying to decide between two suitors. Norman (Ronald Pickup) first fears that he accidentally hired someone to murder his girlfriend Carol (Diana Hardcastle). Then he suspects that Carol is cheating on him. That I devoted most of this review to plot summary speaks to the challenge of telling such a complicated narrative. The movie moves along at a comfortable breezy pace but in doing so sacrifices emotional investment in any one story line. Nevertheless I would gladly see the movie again if just to see Smith do her trademark grumpy English thing. ""How was America?"" someone asks Muriel. ""I had low expectations and came away disappointed"" she replies. Thank you Great Britain. Thomas Lee is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.

Apparently at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel you can check in anytime you like but you can never leave.The original film based on a novel about an Indian retirement home for cash-strapped British pensioners had such a heavy hourglass hanging over it that a sequel seemed like a joke. Yet instead of going for the obvious punchline with ""The Best Exotic Marigold Funeral Pyre"" director John Madden has stripped away the socio-economic context from the first film and turned the sequel into some kind of thinly rationed romantic comedy.Assembling the members of the cast who didnt die in episode 1 Madden faces the twin tasks of mating them and making them relevant. On the second count he utterly drops the ball expecting us to sympathize with a dozen grouchy unremarkable and arguably racist characters who happen to be played by some of the great actors of their era. Absurdly Maggie Smith who played the sourest sourpuss in the first movie is now the co-manager of the hotel alongside chipper native nitwit Sonny (Dev Patel). For no plausible reason they fly to the U.S to persuade investors to fund a second Exotic Marigold Hotel Why Sonny couldnt get a local guy in Jaipur or elsewhere in booming India to lend him the money for a 20-person building is never explained.Then again this is a story about aging without any hint of death and a story about India without any hint of poverty. In India stylish 60-ish cuckold Douglas (Bill Nighy the saving grace of the film) is pining for 80-ish widow Evelyn (Judi Dench). Young-ish Maggie (Celia Imrie) is torn between suitors at opposite ends of an intersection. Upper-crusty private-club host Norman (Ronald Pickup who played the most effectively pathetic character in the first film) rightly believes that his significant other (Diana Hardcastle) is cheating on him. Along for the tiresome ride is Richard Gere as a silver-fox spy for the American investors.Of course with so many implications of old age and death its smart marketing to shift the emphasis to the pending marriage of young Sonny and his lovely fiancee Suniana (Tina Desai). And if you cant guess that the whole thing ends with a big dance number youve been snoozing in your samosas.What ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 202  Content Some suggestive language Tags Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Dev Patel Maggie Smith Bill Nighy Judi Dench Celia Imrie Richard Gere Tina Desai Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Slight but pleasing.The gang (from left Celia Imrie Ronald Pickup Diana Hardcastle Judi Dench Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy) are back for ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.""(Photo 20th Century Fox)Story Highlights3 stars (out of 5)The sequel is a flashier film than the first film with dancing music flirting and wedding plans.Richard Gere plays a visiting writer adding a bit of American spice to the mix.India is breathtaking on film and the colors textures and music of the country pop with pleasureIts fair to say that pretty much nobody not even the most optimistic of its cast members expected 2012s ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" to do as well as it did. A charming and lightweight ensemble film about a group of British retirees setting up camp and forming a surrogate family in an old-age hotel in India doesnt exactly scream box-office gold. Yet its worldwide gross topped 135 million.Moral of the story Never underestimate the appeal of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench.That incomparable cast of seasoned thespians returns for a sequel their characters still rejoicing in and building on the second life theyve discovered in India. Its a bigger and flashier film than the first; theres dancing music flirting and a spectacle of a wedding to plan. But as the axiom goes bigger isnt always better and ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" it turns out is a little too apt a title.The first Marigold Hotel was such a success that Sonny (Dev Patel) the hotels enthusiastic and eager-to-please manager is looking to expand his unique retirement concept and open a second hotel. That plan becomes complicated by the arrival of Guy (Richard Gere adding a bit of American spice to the mix) a visiting writer. Sonny is convinced that Guy actually is a hotel inspector and thus holds the key to making his dream a reality.Richard Gere An American in the Marigold mix Further complicating Sonnys future is the arrival of a rather dashing and rich old friend -- and dance coach -- who hits it off a little too well with his nimble fiancee. These intertwined Sonny plots are the films main narrative through line and they are among the flimsiest -- nothing that a few simple conversations and not acting like a complete jackass couldnt have solved.The same goes for Normans (Ronald Pickup) plot. He is convinced that hes accidentally hired a hit on his girlfriend Carol (Diana Hardcastle) and spends the length of the movie tailing her and making an exaggerated fool of himself. These are sitcom plots and the stakes are considerably pettier than in the films predecessor.Thankfully not all story lines are as thin. Douglas and Evelyn (Bill Nighy and Dench) yearn to begin a relationship now that Douglas is separated from his wife but neither knows how to navigate such sticky emotional terrain. Madge (Celia Imrie) the hotels resident flirt is juggling a pair of rich Indian suitors when her feelings become complicated by a friendship with her driver. And Muriel (Smith as always a treasure) grapples with her impending mortality.Bill Nighy Follow-up was a comfortable fitWhen those plotlines are in focus the sequel feels less like a cash grab and more like an organic extension of these characters stories. And there are still plenty of sensory delights to indulge in; India is breathtaking on film and the colors textures and music of the country pop with pleasure. It is a movie that looks and feels luscious.Its asked in the film ""How many new lives can we have?"" The answer it turns is however many we want. And as long as Dench Smith Nighy and Imrie stick around the same probably is true of ""Marigold"" movies.The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel3 stars (out of 5) Director John Madden.Cast Maggie Smith Judi Dench Richard Gere Bill Nighy.Rating PG for some language and suggestive comments.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic or 602-444-8371.

"Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Fox Searchlight Films Scene from The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Scene from The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. (Fox Searchlight Films) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Easygoing sequel to the worldwide box office success. Three years ago on a somewhat different scale the success of the first ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" was weirdly akin to the success of the first ""Avengers"" movie. Both relied on ensemble superheroics and charmingly fractious banter among movie stars. This year brings sequels to both films. First up is ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" the one without the explosions.Director John Maddens easygoing follow-up resembles a slightly scattered second season of a BBC sitcom. Were back in the Jaipur India retirement hotel run by manic ambitious Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) who plans to open a second establishment. The Maggie Smith character a onetime Cockney racist has mellowed and become Sonnys co-manager. The expat residents played by Bill Nighy and Judi Dench remain fast friends and perhaps more. Already right there add em up Smith Nighy and Dench together again lending many moons worth of relaxed authority to a wisp of a story. Thats more than enough for fans of the first picture. The rest of the gang returns as well minus Tom Wilkinson (whose character died at the end of the first one). Celia Imries Madge who tends bar at a local watering hole is poised between two suitors. On the other hand the way she eyes Richard Geres visiting novelist who may be working undercover for the investor (David Strathairn) Sonny hopes to secure the film momentarily becomes more carnal than anything in ""Fifty Shades of Grey.""This is 50 shades of another sort of gray and theres a tremendous box-office appetite for it. Written by Ol Parker ""Second Best"" offers little you couldnt write yourself but it does so with respectable level of craft. The appeal lies in the ensemble playing. I adore what Nighy can accomplish in the minimalist double-take department just as I admire the key scene late in the film between Dench and Smith for its quiet simplicity. Too often in Maddens film the actors are stuck propping up the story of Sonnys dithering crisis of confidence before his big wedding. But if youve seen the ads for the film youve seen the big wedding dance at the big wedding so ... spoiler alert The end is happy. Imrie a wonderful performer too little known in America recently told the Daily Mail that ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" could never have been made in Hollywood because in Hollywood ""nobody has wrinkles."" The movies smooth to the point of blandness but its faces really do tell a story. And having Geres silverly mane share the same film with Strathairns is almost too much fabulous hair for one diversion.""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" - 2.5 starsMPAA rating PG (for some language and suggestive comments) Latest movies reviewedOpen link Running time 202Opens Fridaymjphillipstribpub.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Review Zero stars for Chappie Review Maps to the Stars Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-second-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-20150305-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,thesecondbestexoticmarigoldhotel28,thesecondbestexoticmarigoldhotel,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A kind of Eat Pray Love for the AARP set The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was a ""surprise hit"" only to those who underestimated the appeal of its setup. Here after all was a whos who of distinguished British actors hobnobbing in lively photogenic India. Was it ageism or just an ignorance to the popularity of travelogues that inspired such incredulity? Either way no one seems to be batting an eye at the existence of this four-years-later sequel which reunites most of the cast of the original for another crowd-pleasing stroll through Jaipur. One could argue that a return trip to the hotel wasnt strictly necessary but checking back in with the residents does support the philosophy of the material--namely a belief that an ending is just a new beginning. Besides theres something heartening about a franchise headlined by a bunch of 60-or-older stars none of whom were catchphrase-spouting action heroes in their youth.Aptly enough one of the main plotlines of this encore installment is a plan to turn the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel--a rundown ""luxury"" establishment for those looking to spend their august years abroad--into a franchise business. Owner and proprietor Sonny played again with manic comic enthusiasm by Dev Patel is seeking American investors to help open a second location; inept at multitasking hes let his expansion plans distract from his upcoming wedding to Sunaina (Tina Desai). Elsewhere Sonnys tenants have romantic issues of their own The flirtatious Madge (Celia Imrie) juggles two wealthy suitors; aging horndog Norman (Ronald Pickup) grapples with monogamy; and the separated Douglas (Bill Nighy) pines for widow Evelyn (Judi Dench) now mulling a career that would require lots of travel. Also still checked in is the ""salty"" Muriel (Maggie Smith) who seems to have shed her unfortunate racism but not her penchant for withering asides.This is typical part-two storytelling ostensibly giving audiences more of what they liked about the first film with only minor variations on a successful formula. But working without the guiding framework of source material--the original was based on a novel by Deborah Moggach but this one isnt--returning screenwriter Ol Parker sometimes struggles with the ensemble equilibrium. Far too much of the running time is devoted to Sonnys intersecting dilemmas his obsession with the friend (Shazad Latif) he fears is after his fiancee and livelihood. In place of Tom Wilkinson who anchored the most poignant of the originals subplots Second offers a dapper Richard Gere whose divorced writer may or may not be an incognito American inspector come to evaluate the Marigold business model. Gere brings a relaxed charisma to the role even as his wooing of Sonnys mother (Lillete Dubey) further clutters up the narrative leaving less room for the principals to work their magic.True to its title The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a mildly inferior sequel diluting the modest charms of its predecessor. Said charms do remain however. Theyre there in the leisurely pace appropriate for the serialized adventures of retirees learning to live again and in the everyday splendor of India a place that director John Madden treats with unwavering awe. (Its a tourists view of the country but a respectful and admiring one.) Foremost the Marigold brand--sure to be applied to some third confection should the second one do as well as the first--guarantees a relatively thoughtful meditation on growing older albeit one sometimes couched in sitcom sentimentality. It also allows for collisions of British acting royalty none more delightful than a periodic sparring of the dames--the verbal tete-a-tete between a Downton Abbey countess and James Bonds one-time superior. There are worse foundations on which to build a franchise.

Because it is in fact the second-best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Which isnt to say that the new film isnt sweet and funny and winning...its all of those things. With Dames Maggie Smith and Judi Dench lobbing wickedly bitchy verbal grenades back and forth how could it not be? But its also predictable corny and mild. Its the kind of movie that provides a perfect answer for when your mother or grandmother calls you up and asks ""What should I go see with the girls after our weekly canasta game?"" When the first Best Exotic Marigold Hotel came out three years ago it was a revelation. Not so much the movie itself which spun a harmlessly agreeable tale about retirees who travel to India to spice up their Centrum years but more what it represented. It was a reminder of a perennially underserved moviegoing demographic that gets rediscovered every decade or so with films like Cocoon and Driving Miss Daisy. After all here was a movie that didnt treat aging as a curse or a crime but as a time in life that might offer a last chance for adventure meaning and perhaps even romance. Getting older didnt have to be an end it could be a new beginning. It was a surprise hit. A follow-up was inevitable. As the new film opens the Marigolds chirpily obsequious owner Sonny (Dev Patel) and his quipping comanager Muriel (Smith) arrive in San Diego where Sonny hopes to persuade the head of a retirement-hotel chain (David Strathairn) to invest in his expansion plans for a second Marigold while Muriel gets to roll her eyes at the California weather and scoff at the perverse American notion of what constitutes a proper cup of tea. Strathairn closes the meeting with the promise of sending an undercover representative to India to check out Sonnys operation and determine the potential of his business plan. Back in Jaipur Sonnys fiancee (Tina Desai) is busily preparing for their upcoming wedding party. But the ambitious groom-to-be is too busy sniffing around for Strathairns spy to focus on the festivities. And when Richard Gere shows up with a thick mane of silver-fox hair and a suitcase full of linen shirts Sonny knows hes the one and bends over backward to make sure his stay is perfect even going so far as to set him up with his mother (Lillete Dubey). Meanwhile another new arrival (Tamsin Greig) whom Sonny ignores may be the real inspector. Episodes of Threes Company have been built on sturdier premises. Of course none of that is why anyone is going to see The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (I pity the poor multiplex employee who has to squeeze all those words on a marquee). What were interested in is the hotels roll call of quirky permanent guests Smiths Muriel Denchs Evelyn Bill Nighys Douglas and the rest of the golden girls and gents who are on the shady side of 70. We want to lose ourselves in their soapy high jinks again and see how their exotic retirement is treating them. For the most part the answer is ""very well."" Theyre busier and bawdier than ever not to mention as hungry for love as a Bachelor contestant. Who says the whippersnappers have all the fun?

The same cannot be said for ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" where coasting is all there is in the hopes that these charismatic and talented actors can somehow make tandoori chicken salad out of a screenplay (by returning writer Ol Parker no longer tethered to the novel by Deborah Maggoch) thats chock-full of unmotivated action half-baked characters and lazily-constructed conflicts so contrived theyd get booted out of the ""Two and a Half Men"" writers room. See Video Richard Gere Is a Dream Guest in First Trailer for Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (Video) In an attempt to spice things up director John Madden shoehorns in the splendor of an Indian wedding plus a few new faces but the result is a sequel so lifeless and uninspired that it threatens to retroactively sour any good feelings you might have had about its predecessor. After a tacked-on prologue in which hotelier Sonny (Patel) and his cranky aide-de-camp Mrs. Donnelly (Smith) drive through the Route 66 desert to San Diego for a meeting with senior-living magnate Ty Burley (David Strathairn) -- and if their flight from Mumbai landed in Los Angeles that means theyre taking one hell of a scenic route -- we quickly get settled into the films parade of bland plot points all of which will be settled in comforting sitcom fashion. Sonny is paying more attention to the expansion of his old-folks-home empire than to his impending wedding to Sunaina (Tina Desai) and he becomes irrationally jealous over her friendship with family chum Kushal (Shazad Latif). Evelyn (Dench) and Douglas (Nighy) have fallen in love but theyre both too afraid to make the first move. Madge (Celia Imrie) finds herself torn between two suitors but oblivious to a third whos right under her nose. Also Read Downton Abbey Star Maggie Smiths Publicist Denies Report Shes Leaving Show Then theres the simultaneous arrival of Guy (Richard Gere) a would-be novelist and Lavinia (Tamsin Greig) whos checking out the hotel in hopes of sending her mother there. Sonny becomes convinced that Guy is actually an undercover employee of Tys so he fawns all over the new guest even when the handsome American starts showing interest in Sonnys mother Mrs. Kapoor (Lillete Dubey). The constant violation of the ""one five-minute conversation would end this movie"" rule would be forgivable if the production offered something interesting and non-story-related for these characters to do but no such luck. Sure Smith gets the occasional zinger but none of them are at the level of what the Dowager Countess gets to say on ""Downton Abbey"" every week. Also Read Neil Blomkamps Chappie Favored at Box Office but Its a Wild Card These pros put on their game faces and muddle through the barely-there romances and dilemmas but its hard to escape the feeling that talent is being grossly wasted; Greig is currently one of the funniest woman on television in Showtimes under-loved ""Episodes"" but youd never know it here given how very little shes called upon to do. Cinematographer Ben Smithard (""Belle"") revels in the vibrancy of modern India from urban Mumbai to relatively laid-back Jaipur but he doesnt bring South Asia to life in a way thats particularly different from any other film shot in that part of the world over the last decade or so. That level of nothing-new-to-see-here sadly makes a perfect fit for this afterthought of a sequel. Watch the trailer below Breaking News To Your Inbox.

With all due respect to everyone who earned it and they are legion I can see no real reason for a sequel to the delicious 2011 hit The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. It was perfect the first time around. But the second jog around the track passes the time pleasantly enough. The senior set deserves a few crumpets with their tea and Part Two which takes up where the original left off aims to satisfy. The British pensioners who ran out of retirement funds relocated to affordable rents in India and refused go home have now taken over the run-down hotel--and business is booming. Somewhere between 75 and death they conduct guided tours of Jaipur submit to regular health checkups to make sure nobody has died during the night and exchange enough nursing-home barbs to keep late night BBC in commercials for years. THE SECOND BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL  (3/4 stars) Written by Ol Parker Directed by John Madden Starring Maggie Smith Richard Gere and Dev Patel Running time 122 min. The illustrious cast is back in case theres someone out there who forgot there was such a thing as taste and talent alive in the world after this years embalmed and catastrophic Oscar show. Evelyn Greenslade (Dame Judi Dench) finds her talent for fabrics put to good use in a paying job sourcing Indian textiles for export. Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith) has become a co-manager with Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) and when the second installment opens they are speeding down an American highway in an open convertible looking for investment money to start up a second hotel. The outcome will depend on an official report filed by an independent anonymous inspector who will arrive unannounced to take notes that could make them or break them. Meanwhile Evelyn and Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) are flirting with the possibility of an octogenarian romance now that his awful wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) has filed for divorce. Norman and Carol (Ronald Pickup and Diana Hardcastle) are lurking after others Madge (Celia Imrie) juggles two rich and randy boyfriends old enough to buy life insurance and Sonny is preparing the hotel and the city outside the gates for his wedding to hotel bookkeeper Sunaina (Tina Desai). In the midst of the fireworks an enigmatic American arrives in the form of Richard Gere a newcomer whom everyone believes to be the dreaded hotel whistleblower. Mostly he falls (unconvincingly) for Sonnys mother Mrs. Kapoor (Lillete Dubey). A cast that big (there are more too numerous to mention) needs room for character development a necessary evil director John Madden quickly abandons in favor of plot twists and a storyline that consists primarily of vignettes. Curiously although adding the length to more than two hours The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel clumps around like a club foot and depends hugely on the charms of its already established characters most of whom have now become such old friends that the audience will forgive them anything. The follow-up movie doesnt have the same freshness surprise or sense of discovery as the first one but the characters are no less endearing. Judi Dench is warm and gentle and wise beyond her years. Maggie Smith helps enormously by padding out the meandering lack of excitement with her usual tart one-liners (""How was America?"" ""Makes death more tempting.""). Mr. Gere is to be congratulated for taking his rightful place as a member of the ensemble instead of hogging the show but in the wedding sequence he gets a chance to demonstrate his dancing skills in a solo spot that proves his tap Terpsichore in Chicago was not a flash in the old panorama. If I have mistakenly given the false impression that I didnt like The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel I apologize. It might lack the same thrill of discovery but its as lively in tone and spirit as its predecessor and a happy reunion with some swell folks whom are a pleasure to be around. A fine time is had by all and thats good enough for me.

Photo Laurie Sparham/Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Running time 122 minutes. Rated PG (mild suggestiveness). Second best by a distressingly large margin ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is a pointless sequel to an overlong but charming little comedy that was never designed to launch a franchise. But the huge success of ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" four years ago ensured that the eccentric British pensioners who outsourced their retirement to a ramshackle Indian hotel would be back for this bigger-budgeted (enough to sign up Richard Gere) interminable and far less entertaining follow-up. People who claim theyd watch top-billed Oscar-winning Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith read the telephone book might prefer that to this rambling schmaltz-drenched script by the first films screenwriter Ol Parker -- matched with the listless direction of the returning John Madden. The desperate attempts by bumbling hotelier Sonny (Dev Patel) to please his crotchety customers were amusing the first time around. Now Sonny is merely annoying as he tries to raise American funding for a second retirement hotel while refusing help from an Indian millionaire (Shazad Latif) who he fears is making a play for his fiancee (Tina Desai). Sonny is also convinced that Guy (Gere) his first American guest is actually an undercover agent for a potential investor (David Strathairn). So Sonny fawns over Guy while ignoring another middle-aged newcomer (Tamsin Greig) -- at least until silver fox Guy starts romancing Sonnys widowed mom (Lillette Dubey). Maggie Smith cant save the dilapidated ""Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.""Photo Laurie Sparham/Twentieth Century Fox When not focusing on Sonnys uninteresting problems ""Second Best"" is basically a landlocked ""Love Boat"" with widowed Evelyn (Dench) using her new job as a fabric buyer to hold off the romantic advances of Douglas (Bill Nighy) whose overbearing estranged wife turns up with their adult daughter in tow to demand a divorce. This sequel sorely misses the presence of Tom Wilkinson whose out-of-the-closet character grounded the first film (but died at the end). In ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel that responsibility falls to Smiths Muriel who trades acidic wisecracks for wise aphorisms as she leads her hot-headed business partner Sonny into going through with the lengthy climactic wedding sequence. Hopefully this geriatric saga ends there.

(Laurie Sparham/fox searchlight) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday March 4 2015 124 PM Title ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" Film Info Oldsters check into an Indian hotel but they dont check out. Director John Madden (202). PG Language. Area theaters. If you call your movie ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" lowered expectations come with the territory. Yes there are good moments from a team of veteran British actors but overall this return visit to the 2012 gray-set rom-com is deadly dull. Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) still managing the colorful old-timers residence in India arranges with Sonny (Dev Patel) to get American corporate funding for a franchise hotel in Jaipur. Most of the characters from the earlier film are still around Douglas (Bill Nighy) who has a continuing flirtation with Evelyn (Judi Dench); Norman (Ronald Pickup) and his galpal Carol (Diana Hardcastle) each wrestling with casual sleeping with others; and Madge (Celia Imrie) juggling various local suitors. Into the idyllic surrounding come a pair of Harlequin-romance-named newcomers Guy Chambers (Richard Gere) who may or may not be a building inspector and Lavinia Beach (Tamsin Greig) who says shes looking at the Exotic Marigold as a potential home for her mum. Speaking of mothers Chambers starts romancing Sonnys mom the brusque Mrs. Kapoor (Lilette Dubey) just as Sonnys wedding to Sunaina (Tina Desai) is being planned. Will Sonny figure out how to franchise his hotel by the wedding? Will the mystery of Guy Chambers be revealed? Will the very-well-seasoned pros do anything with their twinkle-eyed friskiness? Dev Patel as Sonny and Richard Gere as Guy in ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" (Laurie Sparham/fox searchlight) Director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") delays answering for so long that viewers might echo Mrs. Donnellys line ""Im not getting any younger."" Yes the movie turns wrinkles into consistent laughs but there should be a few more of them and fewer soap opera turns. Dench however rocks 79 like its the new 50 and Smith naturally never misses a trick. Nighy twists his lanky body around in absence of a real character. Then theres Gere who looks unclear why someone his age is even in this movie. Judi Dench and Bill Nighy in ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" (Laurie Sparham/fox searchlight) It feels a bit like ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" has the same feeling.

"Review Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel worth a visit - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel worth a visitBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News correspondentPosted 03/03/2015 015444 PM PSTUpdated 03/04/2015 044915 PM PST Its no secret that Hollywood and American culture favor the exploits of the young and the beautiful over the adventures of the mature and the elegant. Every so often though a film or TV show with a veteran cast reminds Hollywood that theres a huge market hankering for stories that reflect more seasoned lives.""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" did just that. The 2012 indie feature about an attractive plucky group of retirees discovering joy in a scrappy hotel in India was a renegade hit mostly thanks to scene-stealing pros such as Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. After it earned more than 136 million during its spry international run producers called for more hence the unspectacularly titled ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.""While this breezy outing does feel very much like a sequel with returning screenwriter Ol Parker throwing the usual obstacles and misunderstandings into the mix the John Madden-directed dramedy is still a pleasant way to spend two hours. ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" digs up complex issues -- sex and death -- but never gets too heavy-handed about them and thats refreshing.What makes it a worthy extension has a lot to do with the presence of Maggie Smith. The two-time Academy Award-winning actress and ""Downton Abbey"" star is once again hilarious as Muriel Donnelly the cranky unfiltered co-owner of the first Exotic Marigold Hotel. Whenever the film careens into preciousness she slaps it in the face. Her rant about what Americans consider tea is priceless.Advertisement Lucky for us ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" spends a lot of time with Muriel and her eager-to-please co-partner in the hotel biz Sonny Kapoor (a charming Dev Patel). The overly ambitious Sonny and the more realistic Muriel concur that its time to open an extension of their popular hotel and head to America to seek the financial infusion from an investment firm (headed by David Strathairn). The goal is to buy another property near their current one.Naturally complications ensue. Sonny grows increasingly jealous of his exasperated fiancee Sunainas (Tina Desai) handsome family friend (Shazad Latif). And Sonnys relentless pursuit of the property threatens to overshadow his upcoming nuptials as he focuses on impressing writer Guy Chambers (Richard Gere) the new hotel visitor who Sonny suspects is an inspector for the American firm. Meanwhile he ignores another new check-in Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig) who says shes looking for a place for her mother. As Sonny accommodates Guys every whim familiar hotel residents grapple with their own dilemmas. Evelyn (Dench) must decide whether shes going to take on a full-time job that will require her to travel and be away from Douglas (Bill Nighy). Both are smitten with each other but their affection is complicated again by the arrival of Douglas bitter negative ex Jean (Penelope Wilton). Meanwhile the flirty Madge (Celia Imrie) must decide what to do about two well-heeled suitors and Norman and Carol (Ronald Pickup and Diana Hardcastle) deal with sexual attractions outside of their relationship one of the films edgier aspects.The most compelling romantic encounter is a new one a budding romance between Guy (Gere) and Sonnys mother Mrs. Kapoor (Lillete Dubey). Gere is an ideal addition to the cast his smooth handsome presence upping the stakes and pepping up the proceedings. The widowed Mrs. Kapoor plays hard to get and it is Guys wooing of her and her sons shock that mom is desired by a man that makes their relationship so interesting.But these various narrative threads require glue and screenwriter Parker finds it in the upcoming nuptials which culminate in a big joyous Bollywood dance number that will surely put a smile on your face. Yes its a little cheesy but so what? (L -R) Celia Imrie as Madge Hardcastle Ronald Pickup as Norman Cousins Diana Hardcastle as Carol Judi Dench as Evelyn Greenslade Maggie Smith as Muriel Donnely and Bill Nighy as Douglas Ainslie in The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. (Laurie Sparham/Twentieth Century) Madden who directed the first film brings his trademark airy touch to ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" While the film is charming the specter of death looming in the background makes the experience bittersweet. The sequels best moments happen in the too-limited exchanges between Dench and Smith. The playful put-downs between these two very dissimilar characters make the film light up and the actresses are so perfect together we wish they were on screen together more.Still the time you will spend in ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" will be well spent. If the first film felt like snuggling up with a warm blanket this one is like sipping a warm comforting cup of tea.

Who knew ""older"" people were so starved for pictures featuring gorgeously shot exotic locales not to mention people falling in love falling out of love or desperately hoping for love all while dealing with assorted problems related not just to aging but to life itself? Directed by Shakespeare in Loves John Madden and based on the novel These Foolish Things by Deborah Moggach the first Marigold Hotel attracted a staunchly adult audience apparently made up of women in particular. Naturally then it was scorned secretly or openly as a hot-flash movie the sort of thing liked by ladies who wear comfy sandals and wrap themselves in shawls for going out to dinner. In other words it wasnt made for you or me. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But the fact that so many of us were surprised by its success -- or worse derisive of it -- suggests that weve lost touch with what movies can mean and how they can mean it. Im wagging the finger not at you but at myself I didnt see The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel when it came out -- no comfy sandals for me thanks. But when I finally did catch it I reconnected immediately with the appeal of watching wonderful actors all of them old enough to feel deeply comfortable in their skin working their way through a not-so-simple story that reflected the incongruities and half-disappointing surprises of real-life living. Why resist Judi Dench Bill Nighy Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson the last not for once playing the trademark sweaty stuffed shirt? Whats more the glossy movieness of Best Exotic Marigold Hotel -- largely filmed in the actual yellow-gold light of Rajasthan -- wasnt a liability but one of its chief selling points. We dont always want that real life unadulterated in the movies; well take the softening filter because sometimes life just really needs it.Now theres a sequel named with suitable drollness The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and also directed by Madden. (The script once again is by Ol Parker.) And if the harsh truth is that this follow-up is second best its still not half bad. All of the original cast -- with the exception of Wilkinson for reasons that will be clear if youve seen the first film -- have returned. In the first picture a clutch of mismatched English people dun certain age descended upon what theyd been led to believe was a plush retirement community in Jaipur -- what they found upon their arrival was a ramshackle old joint badly run by an antic bumbling young go-getter (Dev Patel). Now most of those at-first skeptical residents have settled in to the wobbly-wonderful groove of life at the hotel and life in India Theres Dench last time the sheltered widow who never had to fend for herself now freelancing as a textiles buyer for an American entrepreneur; Nighy the sweet stammering former civil servant now freed from the shackles of his somewhat shrewish wife Penelope Wilton (though she makes a brief appearance and once again makes us feel things wed rather not for an alleged villainess); Celia Imrie the spirited gold-digger who just wont give up; and Smith the former nanny and housekeeper whos now the hotels efficient co-manager.Film Details The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel RatingPG GenreComedy Running Time122 More Info Trailer Lord knows Patels hapless hotelier needs it. Hes hoping to expand his franchise to include a second property and hes also getting ready to marry his girlfriend (Tina Desai). The appearance of a mystery man -- super-silver-fox Richard Gere of all people -- throws yet another wrench into the already gummed-up works.Theres a lot going on here perhaps too much -- Madden and Parker stretch for drama instead of just allowing it to unfurl like a resplendent swath of silk. Essentially though theyre just repeating formula and theres still some magic to be shaken out of it. The banter between the peppery Smith and the much softer-looking though no less fiery Dench is particularly fun. In their one small scene together the two seem to be riffing on undertones of real-life faux rivalry perhaps following the script of Ian McKellens wicked Dame Maggie Smith impersonation from Saturday Night Live ""Judi Dench. Little Judi Dench. Such a clever little Judi Dench. Little clever chubby Judi Dench."" Smith and Dench dont go that far with their mutual ribbing but their moments capture a particular kind of prickly affection.Even better is the halting romance between Dench and Nighy. If youve seen the first movie you wont believe for a second that these two havent yet gotten it together. But Madden and Parker know we want to see how this love story blossoms rather than join it as a work already in progress. Somehow Dench with her understated authoritative glow makes the movies worldly-wise aphorisms (""Sometimes it seems the distance between what we want and what we fear is the width of an eyelash"") seem genuinely wise. You can see why Nighy is besotted with her He sputters and falters more than usual in her presence but still throws off sexy sparks of dignity -- and in his classically tailored dark suits he looks youthfully mod.It doesnt hurt that The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel looks as good as the first Shot by Ben Smithard its a riot of reddish oranges deep-sky blues and pomegranate reds a Ganesha-fest of color. But in the end listing this sequels flaws and charms is a losers game and I throw up my hands I just had fun maybe mostly because watching these actors brings me so much joy. Theres nothing second best about that or about them.1 Photo by Laurie Sparham Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Novelist Deborah Moggach only ever wrote one book about a ramshackle Indian hotel that attracts British retirees. So its down to writer-director team Ol Parker and John Madden to continue the tale bringing back most of the cast - with added Gere as an American tourist suspected of being a hotel inspector. The Jaipur guesthouse continues to be run by chaotic eccentric Sonny (Dev Patel) and most of his British residents have moved east to enjoy late-life careers as a hotel manager (Maggie Smith) cloth buyer (Judi Dench) tourist guide (Bill Nighy) or similar. The gentle plot turns on Sonnys desire to buy a second hotel his wedding and the various characters romances. Its a baggy affair built around too many characters and stories to feel fully focused. Luckily there are just enough truths about ageing beneath its corny farcical surface. Also its hard not to enjoy two hours in the company of this cast.

That original film like this one directed by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) was no great masterpiece to start with given its on-the-nose script and shameless sentimentality. But it was likeable enough and at least had the distinction of being one of the first films to tap successfully into the increasingly significant greying demographic by assembling an all-star cast of treasured British thespians playing plucky types finding a new lease on late life in India. Rounding up most of the old gang once again and throwing in a couple of American names (including Richard Gere and David Strathairn) to boost its international marketability this go-round should do similar sized or even better business worldwide especially for half-price matinees. Having thoroughly depopulated the pool of fish-out-water gags with the original movie Second Best has to rely for momentum on either repeating itself as new characters adjust to the jostling Jaipur environment or complicating the relationships it established initially with all the still-extant romantic couples facing the challenges of taking things to the next level. This means the script by Ol Parker (who also wrote the first film an adaptation of a novel by Deborah Moggach) has lots of plates to juggle and parallelisms to establish as each duo bickers or misunderstands each other in contrived synchronized fashion making for a set of narrative hurdles as repetitive as an Olympic track event. Fans who feel invested in the characters are unlikely to mind however and will probably go away satisfied with the excessively tidy way each subplot is resolved. It would seem that a year or two has passed since the events recorded in the first film and everything is running tickety-boo at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel the hostelry-cum-retirement-community populated entirely by elderly Brits who have ""outsourced"" their remaining years by moving to the subcontinent where the cost of living is low the light plentiful and -- unlike Spains traditional retirement destination the Costa del Sol -- the economy is actually booming. The hotels local part-owner and manager Sonny (Dev Patel) assisted by resident-turned-employee Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) has transformed the crumbling pile into such a success its almost fully occupied. (Mind you judging by the guest roll-calls each morning theres basically the same six people living there that were left at the end of the last movie.) Sonny hopes to build a franchise by buying another faded establishment nearby and is first seen -- with tart-tongued Muriel as his wing-woman -- in the pre-title sequence pitching for financing from magnate Ty Burley (Strathairn) in San Diego. Everything depends on impressing a hotel inspector who will come to stay at the Best Exotic incognito so in classic farce fashion Sonny assumes that must be the secret identity of suave American walk-in guest Guy Chambers (Gere) who arrives at the same time as Englishwoman Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig) a mere stripling in her mid-forties whos come to check out the hotel on behalf of her elderly mother. As Sonny strives to impress Guy he neglects the planning for his upcoming wedding to long-suffering girlfriend Sunaina (Tina Desai) who spends an increasing amount of time with her brothers smooth friend Kushal (Shazad Latif). Meanwhile potholes are encountered in the course of true love for the other residents of the hotel. Despite suggestions made in the last film that they would end up a definitive item Evelyn (Judi Dench) and Douglas (Bill Nighy) are still just good friends even though its patently obvious to everyone else that theyre in love. Norman (Ronald Pickup) and his squeeze Carol (Diana Hardcastle) are seemingly loved up but their joint lack of commitment to monogamy is posing problems while senior sexpot Madge (Celia Imrie) dithers over the choice between two rich local suitors. As the above might suggest its quite a crowded canvas and the screenplay does an only so-so job of knitting all the subplots together in time for the big colorful Monsoon Wedding-style nuptials at the end. Soapier and more sugary all around theres hardly any of the mournful undertow here that eddied around the character played by Tom Wilkinson in the first film helpfully pushing against the ongoing tide of cute saucy one-liners from the other oldies. There are ominous hints that one of the crusty crew will meet his or her maker by the end surely a statistical likelihood given the median age of the assembly. At a certain juncture near the end it seems obvious that just such an outcome was planned but it fails to pan out and some might suspect re-shoot triage was performed after negative feedback from a test screening or cold feet from the studio. Likewise the script seems to be laying the groundwork (echoing another aspect of the Wilkinson plot line in the earlier film) to reveal that Kushal is gay (which might account for his enthusiasm for choreography and constant supply of grapefruit oil) but that gets ducked too perhaps out of fear of offending Indian censors. Certainly this sequel seems to have been made with half an eye on the South Asian arthouse market which would explain why it improves on the first film by giving the Indian characters stronger storylines not just for Sonny and Sunaina but also for Sonnys mother Mrs. Kapoor played with touching dignity by major local star Lillete Dubey (The Lunchbox Kal Ho Naa Ho). Theres even a dance sequence at the end albeit one more Slumdog Millionaire-style than traditional Bollywood but still all these elements play like an attempt to get inside Indian culture rather than looking at it from outside as some ineluctably mysterious ""other."" If Ben Smithards finely graded cinematography and Martin Childs production design rather overstate the city and the regions picturesque shabby-chic prettiness thats sort of an occupational hazard for films made by foreigners shooting in India. It will probably boost tourism and surely that was one of the aims in the end.

Roughly midway through ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" a lovesick Bill Nighy notes that Judi Denchs character has ""checked out"" referring of course to her status at the hotel. Still the pun hangs in the air suggesting a possible euphemism for a more permanent condition. The imminence of death serves as a source of both comedy and poignant self-reflection in this spirited sequel to the unexpected 2012 success assembled hastily enough that none of its ensemble had a chance to ""check out"" before they could all cash in hoping to duplicate the originals 46 million haul (nearly twice as much abroad). If the first ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" was all about seeking rest and relaxation half a world away in India then its relatively hectic successor finds the entire ensemble hustling jobs in Jaipur Douglas (Nighy) gives tours of sites about which he knows precious little; Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) tend bar at the expats club; Evelyn (Dench) hunts for exotic fabrics; and Muriel (Maggie Smith) co-manages the establishment which has been such a success that its ambitious -- and newly engaged -- owner Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) is looking to expand. All this busyness is good for business though it makes for a rather high-stress retirement as no one seems to be taking advantage of the fact they made the move to escape the grind. Though his original hotel is still something of a shambles Sonny has ambitions to buy a neighboring property and fix it up too but for that hell need the financial backing of Evergreen a U.S.-based retirement company managed by a visionary investor (David Strathairn) whose philosophy ""Leaves dont need to fall"" may as well be the mantra of all the hotels overworked residents. Deferred retirements aside theyve never been happier -- which is a curious place to begin for a film that must then manufacture inconsequential misunderstandings and easily resolved conflicts in order to justify another two hours spent in the company of its generally affable ensemble. Even Smith so wickedly pungent in our memories seems to have warmed this time around Nineteen days older than Dench both onscreen and in real life shes the character we cant bear to live without -- a fact that director John Madden and screenwriter Ol Parker (both back from the original) clearly calculated when shifting the narration duties over from Dench to Smith. She opens and closes the film sitting there like a fresh-cut onion making you question whether that mistiness you feel is real or some well-calculated chemical reaction -- in much the same way Thomas Newmans score works elbowing its way in to boost the energy at any moment we might want to catch our breath while also supporting two full-blown Bollywood-style dance numbers. Actually if the filmmakers have a secret weapon it would be the addition of Richard Gere who can weaken the knees of a certain demographic faster than you can say ""osteoporosis."" Here the silver fox shows up at the hotel so soon after Strathairns character indicates hell be sending an inspector that Sonny cant help but see through the mans cover story. Buzzing with ambition Sonny all but ignores his fiancee (Tina Desai) as he trips over himself trying to impress his distinguished guest even going so far as to thrust his own mother (Lillete Dubey) into the strangers arms if it would sweeten the deal. Considering that the vast majority of audiences for the original came to see the venerable British cast -- all of whom except Dench appeared in the Harry Potter movies -- its rather too much to ask that they invest so much interest in Sonnys entrepreneurial aspirations this time around. Hes making beginners mistakes whereas the rest of the ensemble possess the life experience to make their respective quandaries a bit more interesting. For example after all these years Norman has finally found a woman (Diana Hardcastle) who makes him want to settle down and be monogamous only to discover that she appears to have other ideas about exclusivity. And of course theres the ongoing do-si-do between Evelyn and Douglas still unconsummated which the film stretches as far as humanly possible invoking her lingering feelings toward her dead husband and the unfinished business between him and his ex. (Penelope Wilton couldnt resist returning so Parker wrote her into the sequel.) Its not so common to find an ensemble of this caliber so enthusiastic to work together and that chemistry comes across -- not so much in the romantic pairings which Parker rather implausibly constructs so that no one goes home alone (even Sonnys wedding choreographer finds a mate). Rather whatever spark exists off-camera cant help but reveal itself during those irreverent potentially insensitive moments that made the original so much fun. Even the great Smith isnt a good enough actress to hide the clear pleasure she takes from zinging an old friend with a line like ""Just because Im looking at you when you talk dont think Im listening -- or even interested."" For a film conceived without any chance of a sequel in mind ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" actually lends itself surprisingly well to being extended mostly because the cast make their characters so lively were happy for the chance to spend more time with them (the kind of sentence to which the movie cant seem to resist tacking on a gratuitous ""before they die""). The laughs arent as numerous this time around but at least theyre a little less obvious. Overall that seems to have been Madden and Parkers goal to defy -- or at least delay -- whatever expectations fans thought they saw coming. Hence Sonnys decision to expand his operation as opposed to the more cliched (and almost certainly more compelling) alternative wherein some competitor might try to strong-arm them into selling the hotel. So Parker attempts to spin a few surprises that audiences wouldnt have immediately come up with on their own while Madden can be relied upon to keep it all moving swiftly enough that we actually get caught up in their fairly trivial concerns -- like the right way to serve a cup of tea. So whether or not the film is to your taste its creators have tried to do right by the original brainstorming a plot deserving of a sequel before constructing another ""Exotic Marigold Hotel"" thats hardly second-best.

Steve Morrison says March 7 2015 at 952 am The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was very disappointing primarily because of the screen writing. we learned nothing new about the personalities in this movie and if we had not seen the original movie we could not have cared less about the main protagonists or anyone else in the movie. It needed to have been rewritten and tightly edited. Still there are highlights of pure poetry in this movie as there was in the first. For instance in the first movie when Graham died in that swinging garden chair and the crane was emblematic of his spirit leaving his body; in this movie the garden chair was symbolic of Yama the king of death who rules over all. It was shown in several clips such as when a man was upset over the infidelity of his mate or when another fellow was overjoyed at his forthcoming nuptials. It was also a surprisingly nice touch when a hard bitten venture capitalist whose only thought is usually towards the bottom line or by how much he can increase his pot of gold re-enters the movie at the end and delivers the significance of Mrs. Donnallys life telling us that although we may not see the fruit of our labours they will still affect future generations. Reply travelingwithhumor says February 18 2015 at 528 am Factual correction Only Billy Nighy amp; Maggie Smith were in the Harry Potter movies. Reply Claudia says February 17 2015 at 743 pm Just a factual correction; whilst her character is 19 days older in real life Maggie Smith is 19 days younger than Judi Dench.
