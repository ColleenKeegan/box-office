Yet this kind of friendship is one of the most natural varieties of all. Something of what one loves in ones partner is usually found in the partners other partners because of the power of sexual love as such. People linked in love tend to become alike to coalesce. Thats why romantic comedy resonates so deeply with viewers and why critics tend to worry about its well-being as a genre its subject is not just companionship and life choices its identity. Thats also why the premise of the new romantic comedy ""The Other Woman"" is irresistible and why its bland thin realization is all the more disheartening. Cameron Diaz plays Carly Whitten a New York corporate lawyer who is trailing a long string of unhappy relationships; she finds sudden love with Mark King (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a handsome and virile venture capitalist who neglects to inform her that hes married. In planning an erotic surprise for him at his Connecticut home she meets Marks wife Kate (Leslie Mann) who in turn confronts her about the affair. From that confrontation a friendship quickly develops (as Carly says ""Weve been played by the same man""). When they suspect that theres another other woman (Kate Upton) in the picture they take off in pursuit and become amateur detectives and ultimately learn even more about Marks hidden life. As the movie veers from verbal wrangling to slapstick much of whats wrong with it can be pinned to the director Nick Cassavetes who has neither a sense of comic timing nor spacing. Much of whats called ""comic timing"" is actually a matter of proximity or distance. Take a film by the directors father John Cassavetes--his last and least ""Big Trouble"" from 1986 (coming to Anthology Film Archives May 2-4) a comic version of ""Double Indemnity"" starring Alan Arkin as the insurance salesman and Peter Falk as the chump whose wife will do him in for the payout. The movie is no masterwork but it has some uproarious moments such as when the swinging Falk pushes the square Arkin to sample his rare stash of Norwegian sardine liqueur. Ingeniously Cassavetes pere polishes the raw comic gems of Falks great delivery and Arkins expressions in a thirty-second closeup; the timing works because the camera is in the right place. In ""The Other Woman"" Leslie Mann has an extraordinary showcase and she uses it flamboyantly with an amazingly inventive range of inflections and line readings. Shes a major comic actor but Nick Cassavetes does her no favors; his vague framings and ping-pong editing leach the immediacy from her performance. And he turns Diaz playing a poised and serious person with a playful streak into a caricature with a frozen smile and a flustery manner. The proof of the misdirection can be found in a scene that features Mann Diaz and Upton side by side the eye is guided straight to the amateur not because of youth or beauty but ingenuousness. Uptons stolid expressions seem immune to the directors overemphatic indications and keep a measure of spontaneity. For a movie about love ""The Other Woman"" is silent on what brings people together. The smooth talk and worldly wit that gets the affairs started and keeps them going remain unimagined. Marks relationships take place in a void--except for sex which is the real subject of the movie. The opening montage shows Carly and Marks romance starting hot and heavy and its a highlighted plot point that in their eight weeks together they had sex about fifty times. Hes got a furious sex drive and apparently hes irresistibly alluring to women who keep coming back for more. The best thing in the movie (besides Manns very presence) is the mechanics of Marks deception the machinations of the double and triple life. He has been manufacturing an endless repertoire of meetings and business trips and boys nights out in order to keep his affairs going. Whether hes a sex addict in the clinical sense is unaddressed; whats clear is that his lust is inseparable from his lies the fulfillment of his desires inextricable from his callousness. He is in every sense a total dick and the movie runs on the unasked question of whether a total dick is a better lover whether Marks swaggering egotism is an essential part of (or maybe an inevitable result of) his sexual prowess--whether the cavalier heartbreaker with the massive technique isnt a natural object of desire and whether the good guy with whom one settles down confidently doesnt also entail other kinds of settling. In any case though the action of the film shifts early on away from Marks deceptive machinations and toward Carlys solidarity with Kate he remains the axis of the story the maypole around which the entire comic drama is organized. The point of the story is to tear Mark down to demolish the phallic fetish and clear the ground for something more sheltering. (Note that Kates brother the movies Mr. Nice Guy played by Taylor Kinney is a construction contractor.) Yet Kate and Carly--and for that matter the ""other other"" and a host of others--are marked by Mark. He leaves his imprint on them but ""The Other Woman"" doesnt trace it or for that matter reckon with his absence. He comes and he goes. The movie has no unconscious no quiet moments of reflection no frustrated desires no introspection no real secrets. The storys underlying symbolic power remains untapped. But maybe that very power suggests why romantic comedy is the genre most prone to distortions and deceptions why its the one that offers the greatest temptation to sugarcoat and cut corners because its all about identity the stories it tells are the ones that people tell themselves about themselves. Its revelations are the most troubling and its cliches are the most comforting.

The only hiccup in Marks game is that hes not an eligible bachelor. Rather hes a serial womanizing scoundrel whos married to the offbeat but devoted Kate (Leslie Mann).The film works initially when it pairs up the odd couple of Manns hysterically distraught suburban wife with Diazs level-headed urban girlfriend. Awkward moments between them are intermittently amusing.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersEveryone seems to know where everyone else lives works and hangs out. Their pattern of surprise visits grows old fast. Carly meets Kate when she shows up at Marks house one night in a sexy outfit -- plunger in hand -- after Mark lies that he had to take care of plumbing problems. The next day Kate pops by Carlys office and makes a scene. Drunken female bonding ensues.Their friendship becomes cemented after Carly grudgingly invites Kate in when she shows up on Carlys Manhattan doorstep. Carly warns her that theyre ""not going to end up braiding each others hair and drinking Cosmos."" So it comes as little surprise when a scene or two later theyre sitting with braided hair in Carlys closet trying on shoes.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Kate Upton Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann discover the same man has been cheating on all of them in The Other Woman. So they join forces to take him down. VPCThe entire movie lurches along in similarly foreseeable fashion.Cue the requisite dancing montage and clumsy spying on Mark when he hooks up with a third woman Amber (Kate Upton). Cliched revenge sequences involve laxatives poured into Marks wine estrogen in his smoothies and hair thinner in his shampoo with the expected results.Overdone physical humor in the way of pratfalls slapstick klutziness and drunken stumbling abounds. Entire scenarios feel overly familiar. Clad in a white bikini Upton is featured bouncing along a la Bo Derek in 10. When Kate and Carly stalk Mark the over-used musical theme from Mission Impossible accompanies their antics.It takes far too long to get to the money shot when the trio confront Mark. By the time it happens the audience has slogged through bouts of uncontrollable flatulence vomiting in a pricey purse girl-fights on a sandy beach and far too many crying jags on the part of Mann. Her grating little-girl voice brings to mind Lake Bells hilarious diatribe in last years In a World where she urges women to stop talking like ""sexy babies.""Don Johnson makes an appearance as Carlys 60ish dad with a thing for 20something women. His completely unnecessary role lacks any trace of humor. Singer Nicki Minaj has a similarly non-essential part as Carlys sassy secretary.Jokes feel re-hashed and female bonding scenes seem hackneyed and aimed at male wish-fulfillment fantasies -- lots of talk of sexy underthings leg shaving and other grooming habits. It seems odd that a female screenwriter -- Melissa K. Stack -- would create a film centered around women making fools of themselves over one cad of a man. Or perhaps her efforts were filtered by director Nick Cassavetes.With hints of Sex and the City and John Tucker Must Die The Other Woman is largely a contemporary version of 1996s First Wives Club. The simple premise being double-crossed women uniteWhen the climactic face-off finally happens the anticipated female empowerment has come too slowly too blandly and too late. 78 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1hnAZIA",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/04/24/the-other-woman-review/6892015/,200,theotherwoman(2014)1,theotherwoman(2014),usatoday

But it manages to break new ground in rom-com portrayals of cheating men Noah Berlatsky Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics cameron diaz Editors Picks Kate Upton leslie mann Movies nikolaj coster-waldau rom-coms the other woman Entertainment News Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann and Kate Upton in ""The Other Woman"" (Credit Twentieth Century Fox/Barry Wetcher) [Warning Spoilers below]In the rom-com world male infidelity often functions as a kind of plot device. Its an unfortunate but somehow still beguiling flaw in the protagonist that gives him some psychological depth and handily prevents the perfect union from happening too early in the run-time. In films like ""Boomerang"" or ""The Tall Guy"" or the more recent ""Playing for Keeps"" cheating on your girlfriend is just a stumbling block on the road to certain eternal happiness.This is very much not the case in ""The Other Woman"" which opens Friday. Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is not made more charming or raffish or interesting by his infidelity nor is his philandering an opportunity for personal growth. On the contrary unfaithfulness seems to be just about all there is to him. He is an empty vessel spouting (as an overdetermined but still amusing bathroom scene emphasizes) a lot of crap. Rather than an interesting blip in his character infidelity is a substitute for character altogether. And where cheating in many rom-coms can be a way to briefly dial down the comedy in order to make the final romantic triumph more rewarding in ""The Other Woman"" its an opportunity to play up the comedy (as the women torment Mark through various ingenious methods) while tossing the romance altogether.So if theres no romance why call it a rom-com? Its true that the film is not organized around a march to heterosexual bliss -- but its still packed with rom-com tropes. The central budding relationship is between Marks wife Kate (Leslie Mann) and the woman he is seeing Carly (Cameron Diaz). The two are presented as a classic rom-com odd couple pairing; Kate is ditzy erratic and out of control; Carly is focused determined and put-together. And (again in rom-com fashion) the quirky nutball pursues the uptight square nearly to the point of stalking as Kate comes to Carlys office peppers her with phone calls and later sneaks into her building. Inevitably and improbably they bond get drunk and generally behave like romantic leads heading for a big moment. In one scene they roll around together suggestively on the beach; in another Carly is forced to hide beneath Kates dress; in yet another Kates brother Phil (Taylor Kinney) has an earnest talk with Carly asking her to do right by his sister. You Might Also Like And then the third other woman is introduced making this into a three-way love story. Mark it turns out has also been sleeping with Amber played by Kate Upton in all her bikini-clad glory. The film treats the bikini and its contents as a major riveting reveal; Kate and Carly are looking through binoculars to spy on Mark and when they see whom hes with they collapse into breathless ecstasies of jealousy that are for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from lust.  Amber and Kate bond almost instantly with Kate swooning over the heavenly smell of Ambers sweat. The two of them then dance around together before all three head to the ocean for some (off-camera) skinny-dipping.""The Other Woman"" is not by any stretch of the imagination a great film. Just to list its most obvious offenses Nicki Minaj as the spunky black friend is egregious the multiple trans-people-are-weird jokes are deeply offensive and dumb; the rest of the gags are so-so; the plot is predictable. But for all its faults there is a kind of genius in the way that it takes the rom-com raison detre -- the desire to see two lovable people fall in love with each other -- and diverts it for its own purposes. Frothy script aside both Diaz and Mann (and Upton too) have charisma to burn -- even if the moment of intense emotional bonding occurs when a ring gets chucked into the ocean rather than exchanged. Toward the end of the film Amber declares her love for the other two women while adding the caveat that she hopes that they never sleep with the same man again. Then the plot denouement involves everybody wildly hooking up with everyone elses relatives. Friendship and love are intertwined and intermixed; soul mates the film insists are soul mates platonic or otherwise. And it all can be traced back to the cause of this scrum of soul-mating Marks infidelity. In the end he gets punished in a rather -- to put it delicately -- hyperbolic way. ""The Other Woman"" isnt exactly a genre-buster. But this may be the movies boldest stroke that a rom-com in which the man isnt redeemed can still have a happy ending. Follow More Noah Berlatsky.

Cameron Diaz hasnt even tried to be likable in years. After her turns as a mechanophiliac bitch-on-wheels in last years The Counselor and the title role in 2011s dark rom-com Bad Teacher its hard to think that she was ever that sweet girl-next-door-whom-everybody-wanted in Theres Something About Mary. Now with her Amazon frame and a seemingly permanent half-scowl on her lips she seems like she was always destined to play antiheroes and/or heavies. But as The Other Woman starts out Carly Diazs alpha-female corporate lawyer (""a ruthless law robot"" her assistant Nicki Minaj calls her) is happy smitten -- and a victim. The object of her affection and the cause of her betrayal is Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a handsome romantic venture capitalist who over the course of a few weeks makes Carlys otherwise-committed single feel like she may have finally found the One. Unfortunately Mark also happens to be married seemingly happily to Kate (Leslie Mann). Hes been living an elaborate double life -- one that Carly uncovers when she makes a surprise late-night visit to his Connecticut home. Now Carlys dark side shows itself. As vulnerable innocent Kate tracks down and confronts her at her law firm Carly grows cold. She doesnt want anything to do with Mark anymore but she definitely doesnt want anything to do with his overemotional wife either. (Carly doesnt like to show feelings ""Cry on the inside like a winner"" is her mantra.) Thats a fascinating dynamic made especially compelling by Manns energetically histrionic antics but it doesnt last. They have a mutual interest now so they become friends and allies. Then they discover a third woman -- a dim twentysomething bikini babe named Amber (Kate Upton) -- and away we go. Its time to deliver some Hollywood justice to the philandering Mark. Which of course means intricate poop jokes. The Other Woman doesnt practice what it preaches. Youd think a film about feminine solidarity and empowerment would find some time to let its female characters interact but so much of their bonding happens over montages that you may rightly wonder what theyre talking about most of the time. Ironically enough when they do talk the film seems very much to be a mans vision of what betrayed women might talk about -- namely men and their own relative attractiveness with respect to said men. (Once Upton shows up Diaz flies into a jealous rage at this younger woman who is clearly a newer model of her. ""If you play tennis with John McEnroe youre gonna lose"" Mann tells her when they first see Upton. ""I AM McEnroe"" Diaz yells.) They do seem to be enjoying themselves however. Diaz clearly relishes poking holes in her rock-solid stiletto-babe persona and Mann is a gifted physical comedienne occasionally unleashing tornadoes of slapstick.

"Poison Candy The Other Woman and the Disastrous State of Female Comedies << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Poison Candy The Other Woman and the Disastrous State of Female Comedies Movies April 25 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print As Carly a New York power attorney of a certain age (39 or 40) Cameron Diaz spends the first 10 minutes of The Other Woman looking very much like a lady whos just been fucked. Her hair is slightly mussed. Her makeup is on yet kind of off. Her clothes are vaguely rumpled. Its a radiant but slightly blinkered look that doesnt last. Carly soon discovers that the moneyed slickster whos been mussing her up for two months -- his name is Mark and hes played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau -- has a wife in Connecticut. All of Diazs sideways glamour straightens out and stiffens. Its like spilled chardonnay hardening into concrete. For the remaining 100 or so minutes she looks very much like a lady whos been fucked over first by a man and then by the movie. Eventually the wife Kate (Leslie Mann) arrives at Carlys firm then at her apartment then at her office again. Carly wants nothing to do with Kate whom she finds pathetic and insecure. Kate is a whiny blabbermouth with no boundaries no career children or friends (she gave them all up for him). Her best pal is a Great Dane that might weigh twice as much as Mann. Nonetheless she pleads with Carly to help her figure out what to do about her marriage and for reasons known only to the credited screenwriter (Melissa Stack) Carly agrees. But while getting Kates ""ducks in a row"" the two surmise that Mark is seeing a third woman. They stalk him in the Hamptons and Carly explodes because Mistress No. 2 -- the swimsuit model Kate Upton as a buxom dingbat named Amber -- is hotter and younger than she is. A slow-motion sequence of a bikinied Diaz chasing a bikinied Upton ensues. Maybe some people in the audience are supposed to remember Bo Derek in 10 do some math and think 20. But why would that cross your mind in a movie whose comedy and ideas about relationships are aimed at women? Think -2. The Other Woman floats in a toilet-bowl universe not far from Bride Wars and Something Borrowed proving you no longer need Kate Hudson to make a Kate Hudson movie. Just flavor it with contempt for womankind and add other Kates This movie believes its empowering that this trio has gotten together to bring down one man. But to do so the women seem to think its necessary to keep him thinking hes still in all three relationships. Youd also think theyd have something more creative to do than create a ""cheater chore calendar"" (while ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" plays) and rock-paper-scissors which of them will sleep with Mark to preempt his suspicion. The negative-sisterhood comedy has been around at least since Clare Boothe Luce wrote 1936s The Women. Usually theyre satires screwball comedies and farces. It was the basis of The Witches of Eastwick Death Becomes Her and The First Wives Club. Those movies all had their headaches but the filmmakers at least knew what was funny. They knew where the jokes in the gendering were. I dont know what anybody thought they knew in The Other Woman. At some point Diaz and Mann leap into shrubbery. Mann pops up as a truck full of men pulls by and she pretends to do some impossible pre-run stretches using Diazs legs as the men watch. I laughed out loud one time in the theater and that scene was it. Its a moment that couldve been in an actual 30s screwball comedy. But its arbitrary appearance here signals that the movies director Nick Cassavetes doesnt know where the other laughs are. Neither I would guess does the producer who hired him. Cassavetes made Shes So Lovely The Notebook and Alpha Dog movies that all culminate with some kind of violence. (The Notebooks retirement-home coda is the Saving Private Ryan Normandy-invasion sequence of romantic dramas.) He doesnt have the touch you need for a movie like this. Hed have been perfect for a Witches of Eastwick a hard dirty farce about men women and lust that managed to dazzle and insult at the same time. But you need a liar to sell the alleged friendly warmth of a so-called chick flick where Kate can push Carly from a window and still expect a seat across from her at brunch. To Cassavetess credit he can tell only the ugly truth These movies hate everybody. When Kates Great Dane craps in Carlys apartment youve never felt more empathy for a floor. No one knows which takes are funny and which arent. More than once all three women especially poor Upton are caught looking like they dont know what theyre doing. This is not a problem Kate Hudson has had. Hudson appears to own her movies. That ownership has more or less crippled her career but at least it was something. No one is even permitted a claim of ownership in The Other Woman. Nicki Minaj is amusingly on-brand as Carlys non-assistive assistant. Shes all her usual wigs and curves and ""oh snap."" You watch her pocket all her scenes and wonder why she didnt switch parts with one of the other three. You still wouldnt have a movie. Youd have a changeup though. The same goes for Taylor Kinney who plays Kates good-with-his-hands brother. Theres no fuss to his handsomeness or his acting. Hes from modeling and television but if you didnt know that youd assume he was discovered under a hood. Carly gets a load of him and basically licks her chops which is about right. Shes done with Mark at that point and I would pay twice the price of admission to see her drive off into a sex comedy with Kinney. Meanwhile Coster-Waldau of Game of Thrones is playing the classic dirty-dog love as a sex addict. It doesnt need to be much of a performance but his willingness to be as thoroughly humiliated as he is by the end is too disturbing to fill you with satisfaction. This is how people are punished on Coster-Waldaus show. Mann continues to be an actress whos best in small doses. Her pinched neuroticism works when its up against an actor who cares like Paul Rudd. But she doesnt have the range to carry an entire movie. Its painful watching her try here like in an early scene in which Kate has a panic attack and while writhing around on an office bench asks Carly over and over to open a window. The joke is that theyre in a skyscraper but the scene goes on so long that the comedy goes stale. The best scenes in The Other Woman involve Carly first trying to get rid of Kate and then trying to talk sense into her. That Cameron Diaz is the voice of sanity in any film shows how far shes come as a star and how strange womens comedies continue to get. She sits across from Mann in a bar and gives a speech about the bogusness of monogamy and romance. The seriousness with which she speaks in that scene is thrilling. Obviously the movie intends to disabuse her of her heresy. But Diaz has reached a point where shes more believable as a woman of thought wisdom and steel than as the living embodiment of OMG and LOL. She appears to be reconsidering the lessons of Charlies Angels What to Expect When Youre Expecting Knight and Day Bad Teacher The Sweetest Thing What Happens in Vegas The Holiday and In Her Shoes. These are largely abominable movies that treated her sexual glee as a license to degrade. Diaz is the first star to make a workout of being a single woman -- shes Doris Day on a SoulCycle. Day and Meg Ryan didnt have Diazs ease with carnality. Neither did Jennifer Aniston who in movies turned to seeming sexy because it was more fun for her -- and more lucrative -- than seeming romantic. Diaz though had fun with men and women and that used to be enough. But you see her in The Other Woman and mostly she looks aggrieved. Some of that is acting. Some of it feels like the maturation of a persona. Some of it feels like life. All the great romantic-comedy stars hit a wall and a few like Ryan go splat. Diaz is 41 now about the age the public began to tire of Days keen-virgin act and Ryans sense of modern romance. For the first time you can sense hesitation from Diaz resistance and not only because The Other Woman is so shoddily assembled. You sense it because maybe she expects more from herself. The 12 people who caught her become an omnipotent femme fatale in The Counselor and were astonished could sense Diaz turning a corner into some deeper psychological place. The movie led her to drive What Happens in Vegas straight to hell. This is a woman whose stardom has evolved. She knows its time to stop being fucked and start fucking you.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post So much screamed ""Noooo"" about the prospects for the comedy ""The Other Woman"" starring Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann and Kate Upton. The set-up felt more tweak than innovation. Wife learns husband has a mistress. Mistress learns latest lover has wife -- and a mistress. Beneath the notion that the three women would become friends and avengers could be heard the faint hum of the 1996 comedy ""The First Wives Club."" Still hopes were aflutter. After all the reteaming of director Nick Cassavetes and Diaz held promise. They worked together on ""My Sisters Keeper."" Only Id mixed up that lovely weepie with the lovely dramedy ""In Her Shoes."" Sigh. Hopes have since been dashed. Not unlike the denial of Kate King (Mann) after the Connecticut housewife learns husband Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau of ""Game of Thrones"" ) has been having an affair. Diaz portrays super-lawyer Carly Whitten. Shes as self-sufficient and ready to move on as Kate is needy and stuck. After some much-lubricated bonding the unlikely duo finds out the handsome and very busy entrepreneur cheats on his mistresses too. Besides bringing her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue bounty to this film supermodel Upton brings a kind of sweetness to the predictable. Ditto Taylor Kinney who plays Kates utterly grounded brother Phil. Pop star Nicki Minaj sashays in and out as Carlys no-holds-barred secretary Lydia. If your interns show up at your office in business-inappropraite attire fault movies like this one. Its less a comedy than a mystery why 20th Century Fox fought so hard to get the film ratings arm of the Motion Picture Associaton of America to change its R to a PG-13 rating. Sure it signals that the film doesnt come with the dirty yuks and steady stream of blue language of a number of female-bonding comedies. Its pretty innocuous in fact. But why on earth would any young woman or teen want to see this mess? Those moviegoers have chosen Katniss Everdeen and Tris Prior as their matinee idols. And cable has long offered viewers a slew of female friends and frenemies starting with ""Sex amp; the City"" and extending to Lena Dunhams ""Girls."" Granted it would be nice to have a ladies night out at the multiplex but no one need be this desperate.

You cant complain that the filmmakers - director Nick Cassavetes and screenwriter Melissa K. Stack - arent enthusiastic about their hijinks. Practically every gag in this movie and there are scores of them is milked dry. When the gags arent very good to begin to with this is a prescription for disaster.Cameron Diaz plays a tough-cookie attorney who discovers her dreamboat boyfriend (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is a married man. The crumbums wife played in full screech by Leslie Mann is a homebody who wronged discovers her inner avenger. Shes still sweet though. Harmlessness after all is this movies calling card.Tastefulness not so much. In keeping with the ""Bridesmaids"" tradition not to mention the standard-issue slobbola guy comedies bathroom breaks are occasions for gross-outs.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 25 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 25 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Only Lovers Left AliveWritten and directed by Jim JarmuschStarring Tilda Swinton Tom Hiddleston and Mia WasikowskaClassification 14ACountry USALanguage English3. 5 starsJim Jarmuschs nocturnal romance film Only Lovers Left Alive is like an attic full of memorabilia photographs books old machines and vintage musical instruments. His best film since the 1995 western Dead Man is once again an idiosyncratic version of a genre film in this case a vampire flick although its about as far from Twilight as you can imagine. The vampires here played with elegant sang-froid by Tilda Swinton as Eve and Tom Hiddleston as Adam are lean pale hipster blood addicts. Theyre not so much living dead as exceptionally cool. Video Video A complete (and stunning) look at the winners of the Governor Generals Medals in Architecture Adams a musician (his drone-and-crash dirges were composed by the director) as well as a record and guitar collector who lives in a dilapidated house in the ruins of a slightly in the future Detroit. His roadie/dealer and all-around Igor-figure is a cheerful mortal named Ian (Anton Yelchin) who supplies Adam with objects from the outside world. Adam ventures out for night drives through the city in his classic Jaguar to make blood-bank withdrawals from Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright). But immortality is weighing on him and hes given to episodes of suicidal depression over what the ""zombies"" (thats mortals like you and me) have done to the planet.The love of his life Eve is more into the literary scene haunting the golden-lit nocturnal alleys of Tangier where Paul Bowles and the Beat writers trod before her enjoying her books in many languages and occasionally visiting her old friend the Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt) who has a line to the ""good stuff"" or quality human blood. But Eve worries about Adams mental state and afflicted by foreboding dreams decides to go to Detroit (booking night flights all the way naturally) to see Adam. They make love (pale lean bodies posed against the dark) suck on blood popsicles dance and drive through Detroit at night taking a spin past rock star Jack Whites childhood home.Theres a melancholic end-times chill in the air (the zombies have contaminated the blood supply and the water supply is in trouble as well). Worse Eves bratty teenaged sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) shows up from Los Angeles (""zombie central"" sniffs Adam) and decides to crash for a while. Teenage vampires are the worst Her bratty misbehaviour forces Adam and Eve to start a new chapter in their lives.Only Lovers is so fluidly edited and thinly plotted that it feels almost off-hand; yet its also made with great care beautifully lit and set-designed to an eyelash. Beneath this arch take on the overworked vampire genre its impossible not to see how personal a film it is almost Jarmuschs crypto-manifesto on his artistic values. Adam and Eve are children of the sixties (a wall photograph puts their most recent marriage date at 1868) and their literary and musical magpie sensibility mirrors Jarmuschs own. The 61-year-old director acknowledges his own partner of 34 years Sara Driver in the credits.As usual his inspirations are musical and the soundtrack serves as an excellent mixtape of his eclectic taste from Wanda Jackson to Paganini. The action stops entirely for two musical numbers the New York ""space rock"" band White Hills in Detroit and the Paris-based Lebanese singing star Yasmine Hamdan in Tangier. The films title Only Lovers Left Alive is taken from a 1964 teen revolution novel by Dave Wallis. Jarmuschs mentor Nicholas Ray planned to adapt it into a film starring the Rolling Stones. You could think of Only Lovers as Jarmuschs Rebels Without a Pulse.Nine years ago when Jarmusch made his supposedly commercial film Broken Flowers with Bill Murray a New York Times magazine profile called him ""the last of the indies"" a director who had never made a film under a studios watch. In a phrase appropriate to this movies genre he said ""Im not interested in hitting the vein of the mainstream."" He may not hit it this time either but Only Lovers Left Alive is definitely ""the good stuff.""The Other WomanDirected by Nick CassavetesWritten by Melissa StackStarring Cameron Diaz and Leslie MannClassification PGCountry USALanguage English2.5 starsThe artistic bloodline of Jim Jarmusch traces back to another of his idols John Cassavetes the father of American independent film in a dozen pictures from 1959 until his early death in 1989. Cassavetess biological offspring Nick Cassavetes is a very different kind of director. Like John hes an actor-turned-director and ever since his 1997 adaptation of his fathers script for Shes So Lovely hes endured unflattering comparisons to his old man.One thing that father-and-son Cassavetes share is a fascination with stories about women. (Nicks blockbuster 2004 weepie The Notebook featured his mother Gena Rowlands the star of his fathers domestic epics Gloria and A Woman Under the Influence.) Already that puts them in a minority of American filmmakers.But Cassavetes Jr. doesnt tend to make the auteur list. His work is wildly uneven not only from film to film but from scene to scene. His latest The Other Woman written by Melissa Stack is no exception Apparently intended as a blend of Bridesmaids and The First Wives Club its often oddly engrossing almost despite itself largely thanks to the performances and the free rein the director gives his stars.Cameron Diaz holds the centre of the film as a hard-edged Manhattan lawyer Carly Whitten who discovers that her wealthy handsome devoted new lover Mark (Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has a wife back home in Connecticut. Carly is ready to cut her losses chalking it up as one more male disappointment but the wife Kate (Leslie Mann) wont make cutting the strings easy. As weepy and emotionally needy as Carly is independent Kate seeks out Carly for explanation and consolation.How you respond to The Other Woman depends a lot on how you tolerate Manns performance a deliberately grating turn (think Jim Carrey in The Cable Guy Bill Murray in What About Bob?) that stomps all over your comfort zone. She wears the tight-wound Carly down who sees in Kate everything she tries to repress in herself. In the films most rewarding half-hour the two women bond by getting plastered exchanging clothes and comparing their disappointment in men. Their incentive for revenge is triggered when they discover that Mark is two-timing (three-timing?) them both with another woman Amber a young bombshell in a bikini who looks like a Sports Illustrated cover girl (played by Sports Illustrated cover girl Kate Upton) who joins their cause. (""I feel like she ups our average"" says wife Kate.)The second half of the film is largely grating as Carly Kate and Amber do everything from feeding Mark laxatives to slipping estrogen into his morning smoothie. But there are some loose apparently improvised moments when the actresses are better than the material which suggests that Cassavetes has some of his fathers instincts. The characters fall into female movie sterotypes - Carly the selfish careerist type which rhymes with ""rich"" Kate the neurotic housewife and Amber the voluptuous bimbo but they emerge as something different The smart and resilient one the lateral thinker and the empathetic young woman. This is more ""feminish"" than feminist but arguably a tottering stiletto-heeled step forward.

"Other Woman The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; other-woman-the_2756 ) Other Woman The (United States 2014) April 24 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Has it come to this for director Nick Cassavetes? The son of acclaimed iconoclast filmmaker John Cassavetes Nick has been toiling in mostly indie circles for the better part of his career making some fine motion pictures in the process Unhook the Stars Alpha Dog and My Sisters Keeper. What a comedown to find him in charge of such an unfocused unfunny scatologically-obsessed ""comedy."" A movie that relies on audience obtuseness and believes infantile humor is the best kind The Other Woman ignores dozens of potentially edgy possibilities to tell the most banal story imaginable - and to do it badly. Cassavetes isnt solely responsible for this misbegotten creation but as director he has to assume the lions share of the liability. The studio would have us believe that The Other Woman is a ""female empowerment"" motion picture. However the only thing this movie informs viewers is that comedies with female protagonists can be just as insulting and offensive as those with male protagonists. As much as I may have disliked Bridesmaids and Bachelorette at least those movies had the courage of their convictions to descend into the mud and revel in bodily fluids and raunchiness. The Other Woman arrives with a tarnished PG-13 rating meaning it self-censors in ways that are painfully obvious. The movie dances around the edges of the R-rated envelope but is careful never to penetrate it. The screenplay credited to Melissa Stack (her first feature) cant decide whether it wants to be funny or serious and as is so often the case it ends up being neither. It doesnt help that the main antagonist who is portrayed sanely throughout most of the production turns into a frothing-at-the-mouth lunatic during the final sequence. It would be easy enough to dismiss the concept of ""character consistency"" in an outright comedy but The Other Woman wants to develop some melodrama - the pain experienced by the wife and the bizarre sense of sisterhood that ripens among the women. Still bad drama can be forgiven if the laughs are abundant. And while comedy is subjective The Other Woman falls considerably short of the hilarity quotient served by other similarly targeted motion pictures (The Hangover comes to mind). It also relies heavily on ""gross-out"" humor - the kind of stuff that appeals to eight-year-old boys. In one scene a character vomits into her handbag. In another a dog takes a dump on a kitchen floor. Then theres a painful sequence in which a character victimized by a laxative overdose spends an excruciatingly long time in a bathroom stall. Thats not to say theres nothing funny to be found in The Other Woman - the ""Mission Impossible"" scene is amusing and there are some witty one-liners but those are needle-in-the-haystack moments and the haystack is littered with manure. The premise of The Other Woman resembles that of the frothy 2003 film Chasing Papi. It starts out with the rhythm of a traditional rom-com with a handsome wealthy businessman Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones) wooing hard-hearted lawyer Carly (Cameron Diaz in full ""cold hearted bitch"" mode). He breaks through her defenses with ease oozing too much charm to be real. When paying a surprise visit to his home Carly learns the truth hes married. After several awkwardly choreographed encounters Carly and Kate (Leslie Mann playing a version of the same character she essays in every Judd Apatow film) become improbable friends. Then they learn that Mark has another woman on the side - the bodacious Amber (Kate Upton who cant act - not that it matters). The three women get together and concoct a revenge scheme. Actually as the womens plot which involves laxatives estrogen and a hair removal product gets underway The Other Woman shows signs of becoming enjoyable but the illusion is short-lived. The distasteful bathroom scene kills any burgeoning comedic momentum. The ending is mishandled with the ""spectacular"" climax being noticeably botched. Possibly because it involves an elaborate special effect it couldnt be repeated so were left with something sloppy and incompetent. Sadly those qualities describe not only the ending but the movie as a whole. Hollywood has recently discovered that theres a market for the Sex and the City demographic. Foisting movies like this upon them is a good way to dry it up.

"Review The Other Woman devolves and dumbs down its characters - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review The Other Woman devolves and dumbs down its characters The Other Woman Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews The Other Woman starring Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Kate Upton. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews The Other Woman starring Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Kate Upton. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy SharkeyLos Angeles Times Film Critic Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann and Kate Upton star as women wronged IN ""The Other Woman."" Director Nick Cassavetes whose soft touch with romance was behind that classic date movie ""The Notebook"" is now responsible for the quintessential anti-date movie -- ""The Other Woman.""There is no question whose side he is on in this little bit of rasty business starring Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann and Kate Upton. My advice to guys? Step away from the vehicle because ""The Other Woman"" is out of control and intent on running down a certain kind of male. Even if youre not the lying cheating thieving type -- that would be Mark a slickster played by ""Game of Thrones"" Nikolaj Coster-Waldau juggling wife mistress other mistress and some other ill-gotten gains -- there is bound to be collateral damage.FULL COVERAGE More movie reviews The comedy written by Melissa K. Stack is essentially a revenge fantasy for any female with unresolved issues over a duplicitous relationship. Actually its closer to a dozen revenge fantasies going back to earlier wish-fulfillers such as ""The First Wives Club"" ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""Nine to Five."" Like Mark the filmmakers cant commit to any one revenge scenario so they try doing it all which ironically is the very thing that leads to Marks downfall. ""The Other Woman"" Barry Wetcher / 20th Century Fox Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Cameron Diaz star in ""The Other Woman."" Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Cameron Diaz star in ""The Other Woman."" (Barry Wetcher / 20th Century Fox) Slyness slapstick and sex can often be mixed to amusing effect whatever the specifics -- the original ""Hangover"" for example did a credible job of it -- but ""The Other Woman"" is ultimately undone by its indecision.The film opens with two sophisticates -- Mark and Carly (Diaz) -- locked in the throes of late-night lust. The kind that requires heavy breathing and desperate groping while pressed up against a handy wall. It suggests this may be their first time.For a few weeks they date flirt and wake up together in traditional rom-com style their upscale polish captured in lovely montages by director of photography Robert Fraisse with the same affection he brought to ""The Notebook."" Photos Theyre writers theyre moms theyre directors comedians actors and theyre all hilarious. Heres a look at some of the funny women in Hollywood who are equal parts stars and role models.By Nardine Saad Los Angeles Times Everything shifts when we see Mark going to bed with Carly one night and waking up with Kate (Mann). Kate in a dowdy housecoat is fussing over Marks cholesterol levels. Caring perhaps; sexy no as if to explain why Marks such a naughty boy.While the movie works to define the women the filmmakers indecision starts to chip away. Is Kate ditsy or brainy? Initially Mann makes her wide-eyed then weepy. But there are allusions that the ideas Mark converts into moneymakers are hers not his.Carly in contrast is a classy attorney at the top of her game. She is smart enough to keep the sassy Lydia as her secretary a scene-stealing Nicki Minaj essentially playing a Nicki Minaj knockoff. But its not long before the filmmakers start dumbing Carly down too. Its like the flu in this film something thats going around.PHOTOS Our favorite funny women and why we love emQuestionable relationship advice from Carlys dad Frank (Don Johnson) leads to an awkward meeting between mistress and wife. The unsuspecting begin suspecting which soon leads to teaming and scheming. Beware two women scorned.And then there are three.The takedown of the cheater involves Kate and Carly doing some silly sleuthing which uncovers another other woman. Amber (Upton) registers high on the hot scale but shes sweet willing and soon enlisted.The comic hijinks revolve around the trios coordinated attacks -- ruffling Marks ego riffling his business files and working through their rage issues. The last one introduces Kates cute contractor/brother Phil Taylor Kinney playing it much cooler than his steamy ""Chicago Fire"" fighter on the popular NBC drama series.Phil is the stand-in for all the stand-up guys in the world -- he doesnt get much screen time. Even Mark is little more than an accessory. The focus is squarely on the women though Uptons primary job is to rock a white bikini which she does.Diazs character is older and wiser than the kind of rom-com innocent she played so well for so many years. The hair gel scene in ""Theres Something About Mary"" the off-key karaoke in ""My Best Friends Wedding"" head a long list of unforgettable moments that relied on Diazs talent for making her characters seem guileless.In the fortysomething world Diaz must now maneuver adorable and innocent no longer work. The actress still has that mega-watt smile but she hasnt got all the aging-gracefully kinks worked out of her comedy as disappointing films like ""Bad Teacher"" and ""Knight and Day"" have demonstrated. ""The Other Woman"" is a better forum for her talents but barely.For Mann the film is a good platform to show what she can do when shes not being featured in a film by her significant other Judd Apatow. Here shes as much the star as Diaz. As Kate the actress is far less tightly wound than usual and fearless in sacrificing any sense of decorum for a laugh. She gets most of the ones she goes for. Being this kind of bad guy is no easy task for Coster-Waldau. The actor such a wonderfully complicated antihero as Jaime Lannister in ""Game of Thrones"" struggles as the already slight Mark devolves into distasteful stereotypes. As do they all.Eventually the getting even and dumbing down gets tiresome. Somewhere along the way ""The Other Woman"" forgets how to have fun with a bad romance. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------------------------------The Other WomanMPAA rating PG-13 on appeal for mature thematic material sexual references and languageRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Cameron Diaz The Other Woman (movie) Reviews Leslie Mann Celebrities Other Woman to take down mighty Captain America at box office Our favorite funny women and why we love em Other Woman to take down mighty Captain America at box office Cameron Diaz Fox win ratings appeal for The Other Woman Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-the-other-woman-20140425,0,5118656.story",200,theotherwoman(2014)11,theotherwoman(2014),latimes

A comedy with all the charm of a depilatory the picture begins with Cameron Diaz and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau an actor who looks like the poor womans Aaron Eckhart (and isnt that a lousy job?) sharing a bunch of blissfully erotic Manhattan weekends. Cut to a Monday morning in the Connecticut suburbs where the crumb-bum wakes up in bed next to wifey Leslie Mann. You see the guy is a cheater. In fact hes a serial cheater because hes also two-timing Mann and Diaz by bedding Kate Upton. (Or would that be three-timing?) And if you think hell hath no fury like a woman scorned -- well triple that once these gals find out and join forces. Feminist revenge comedies can be great fun (""The Women"" did it best even if most of those characters revenge is on each other) but they need to have a few things to work. They need to have heroines youre interested in. They need to have a worthy adversary. And they need to have jokes. And while this may seem obvious to you I wish someone had told screenwriter Melissa Stack. As the husband Coster-Waldau mostly acts with his chin. And as the women -- well they all hit the ""rewind"" button. Diaz reprises her cold-hearted hard-bodied predator from ""Bad Teacher"" (but minus the politically incorrect humor). Mann takes another huff of helium and resqueaks her way through ""This Is 40."" And Upton? Upton seems to be reliving that Sports Illustrated spread where she floated around in space and nearly lost her bikini. She does get to run on the beach a lot in slow-motion (a small sleazy present I guess for any straight male dragged along on date night). And Mann to be fair works very very hard looking for laughs although she might have had more luck if she took a flashlight. Or maybe a microscope. But Nick Cassavetes who hasnt had a hit since ""The Notebook"" directs as deftly as if he were wearing boxing gloves. Scenes are overlit -- the photography does Diaz no favors -- the sound editing is awful and music cues are scored with a sledgehammer. Someone drives into Manhattan? Time to cue Frankie belting ""New York New York."" Our three heroines are hanging out giddily? ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun."" Theres some silly marital espionage underway? Drag out the old ""Mission Impossible"" theme. Does Cassavetes really think these choices are clever? Or does he think so little of us he assumes we will? The rest of the movie folds in Don Johnson as an old rake (no) and a lot of gross jokes about diarrhea vomit pubic hair and incontinent dogs. Oh and Nicki Minaj -- as Manhattans least-likely legal secretary -- continues her own one-woman assault on good taste. The only thing missing from this steaming casserole in fact is the one crucial ingredient A sense of humor. Give Mann credit at least for trying hard (including some drunken loose-limbed slapstick that nearly rivals Leonardo DiCaprios in ""The Wolf of Wall Street""). And the film for shooting a New York story in New York for a change instead of Toronto. But give yourself some credit too and watch that old Goldie Hawn flick instead. Or give yourself a bikini wax. It cant be any more painful than this -- and at least you wont even have to listen to Nicki Minaj. Ratings note The film contains strong language alcohol abuse and mild violence.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Barry Wetcher) Share PhotoOn its surface ""The Other Woman"" is a very welcome thing A movie starring talented funny women with their own punch lines and everything. In the movies this is bizarrely rare.But what do the stars in ""The Other Woman"" -- Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann along with a side of model-turned-actress Kate Upton -- do the whole movie? Gab about a guy.""The Other Woman"" is a slick hell-hath-no-fury comedy of female revenge peppered with cheap and unimaginative toilet humor but its elevated somewhat by the fine comic duo of Diaz and Mann.Its simple concept -- the banding together of a wife (Mann) and two of her husbands unwitting mistresses -- is dispiritingly sitcom-y and its womanly uprising is a farce of female empowerment predicated on the characters shallow lives revolving around a man.But its also light and snappy thanks largely to the chemistry between Mann and Diaz. As far as glossy formulaic comedies with questionable gender politics go you could do a lot worse.We enter the story through Diazs character Carly a high-powered high heels-wearing Manhattan attorney used to making men her prey. Yet her feelings are surprisingly strong for her latest fling Mark King played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau of ""Game of Thrones"" again playing a Prince Charming on the outside cad on the inside. When she turns up to surprise him at his Connecticut home dressed as a sexy plumber shes aghast when his wife Kate (Mann) answers the door.Kate soon enough realizes whats going on and turns up with her Great Dane in tow at Carlys office (where Nicki Minaj makes excellent use of her few minutes as Carlys assistant). Manns jilted wife isnt out to get Carly but needs a friend outside of her circle. A reluctant Carly eventually yields to Kates desperate persistence.They make a funny pair one the polished cool attorney the other a frazzled ditzy emotional mess. Kate is slow on the uptake ""Does this mean hes not training for the marathon?"" she wonders. She feels an ""all-American rage"" bubbling up and the two conspire to stealthily deliver Mark his comeuppance. They hit it off over drinks giving Mann a chance to reprise her excellent barfing drunk from ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin.""If ""The Other Woman"" which was directed by Nick Cassavetes (""The Notebook"") from a script by Melissa Stack were wittier their schemes would be more creative than spiking Marks shampoo with nail polish remover or his drink with something that will make him run for the bathroom. (""Bridesmaids"" was far more creative in such a scene with Maya Rudolph surrendering like a sad swan in a heap of wedding dress in the middle of the street.)When Upton as Marks latest conquest joins the group she mostly just plays the part of eye candy jogging in a bikini in slow-motion. She fits in without disturbing Mann and Diazs rhythm of physical comedy and pratfalls. Frankly impressed by Uptons looks Kate is happy to have her bring up ""the group average.""But Cassavetes seemingly tries to sap any energy that Mann and Diaz give the film. Any time music kicks in terrible filmmaking results usually in montage form. The wealthy interiors -- Manhattan Fairfield County the Hamptons -- increase the artificiality of the film which climaxes crudely.The real question is Why exactly would these three women think twice about this guy? Theyre all so out of his league.""The Other Woman"" a 20th Century Fox release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""for mature thematic material sexual references and language.""

If the movies makers are flailing for laughs they often summon some poor pooch to register reaction shots at the purported merriment. See? Cause its funny Melissa J. Stack and Nick Cassavetes the writer and the director of The Other Woman must have felt especially unconfident about their human characters because they went whole hog (well whole dog) with a Great Dane in the custody of Kate King the wronged spouse played by Leslie Mann. When Kate visits the SoHo pad of her husbands mistress chic attorney Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) the beast unloads a few giant turds on Carlys gleaming floor. Later in a cramped sports car it whiplashes Carlys face with its very public private parts. The female revenge comedy is as old as Lysistrata (411 B.C.) and in movies as fitfully popular as 9 to 5 (1980) and The First Wives Club (1996). So no one begrudges the racy PG-13 rated The Other Woman for offering its comeuppance scenario against Kates serial philanderer husband Mark. Played by Game of Thrones Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as a kind of Aaron Eckhart 2.0 with equal parts charm and sleaze he seems like Carlys Mr. Right thoughtful and generous as he pours on the love syrup. Even if hes too good to be true Carly says with a CinemaScope smile ""I just want to stay in the bubble just a little while longer."" But the bubble bursts when Mark skips out on a date citing drainage problems at his suburban home. Carly shows up in sexy plumbers gear like the sexiest Strippergram and finds Kate. (READ Our cover story on The First Wives Club by subscribing to TIME) Comicplications ensue a few involving the Great Dane and build when the two women learn that Mark is sampling yet another side dish the buxom Amber (Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover girl Kate Upton) vacationing with him on a Miami beach. ""You smell amazing -- what is that?"" Kate marvels despite herself. Amber ""I think its just sweat."" The mandatory trio of women -- one smart one frumpy one sexy like Jane Fonda Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton in 9 to 5 or Diane Keaton Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn in The First Wives Club -- may now officially convene. In Carlys succinct phrase ""The lawyer the wife and the boobs."" We know Carlys the brains diplomas from Cornell and Columbia are prominently displayed in her office. And Kate is for most of the movie a screeching idiot -- not just because shes prone to self-flagellation (""I feel that I have to go to Brain Camp"") and panic attacks in the lobby of Carlys law firm (""Does this window open?"") but because she repeats each of these lines about a half-dozen times. Looking far finer than she usually does in her husband Judd Apatows comedies but channeling a few of Kristen Wiigs most grating Saturday Night Live characters -- say a sour mixture of Gilly Dooneese and Sexy Shana -- Mann gives either a fearless reading of poor Kate or an unrelentingly shrill one. (READ Mary Pols on Kristen Wiig and Judd Apatows Bridesmaids) The two stars are meant to provide comic counterpoint -- Mann whining ""Im sad"" and Diaz snapping ""Then cry on the inside like a man"" -- but they often give the impression of appearing simultaneously in different movies. Diaz 41 whos been playing the sensible likable siren for half her life (since The Mask in 1994) handles the badinage as if shes in an upmarket romp with a three-digit IQ. Its left to Mann 42 to drag Diaz into the clumsy farce gags as when she shoves her out of a second-story window or pretends Diazs legs are her own after they stumble into some shrubbery. The same bifurcation applies to the supporting male characters Don Johnson as Carlys five-time-divorced dad -- the last time from one of his daughters sorority sisters -- and Taylor Kinney (Chicago Fire) as Kates impossibly sweet and handsome brother. Kinneys only function is to give Diaz an eventual dreamboat mate as Coster-Waldaus is to be ritually humiliated the way every cheating skunk should. The estrogen and hair-removal supplements that Kate has been putting in Marks morning health drink have given him prominent nipples and a patch of baldness -- embarrassments that somehow disappear before his tryst with Amber. His final unmanning complete with broken nose is served up at Carlys office by the now-empowered female trio. (READ Richard Schickel on Cameron Diaz in What Happens in Vegas) And yet all three women are less watchable and amusing that Nicki Minaj as Carlys legal assistant Lydia. Heres someone who enjoys a job she doesnt feel the need to excel in -- ""Its like having a hobby that pays well"" -- and dispenses the working-girl wisdom that ""Selfish people live longer."" In her first onscreen movie role (after voice work in Ice Age Continental Drift) the rapper proves herself star material. Utterly relaxed she delivers her lines in a silky or growly tone and represents the note of skepticism that The Other Woman could use more of. Instead Minaj disappears while the film goes away and awry with the lawyer the wife and the boobs. Also the dog. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Barry Wetcher/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Twentieth Century Fox Leslie Mann Nicki Minaj Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton have nothing to do in The Other Woman. Barry Wetcher/Twentieth Century Fox There is a moment in The Other Woman in which Leslie Mann and Cameron Diaz playing a wife and her husbands former mistress -- now friends -- fall into a hedge together. When theyre spotted theres a little bit of physical business thats legitimately funny. If you can ignore the fact that the moments of this kind scattered through the film are decorating such a conceptually odious stupid-to-the-bone enterprise some of them may make you laugh. But it may also occur to you just how bad -- how bad -- it is that this is what we have to offer Mann and Diaz who show themselves in these moments to be really able comic actresses a story in which they play idiots with no interests of any kind except bickering over an utterly charmless man and then satisfying themselves that giving him explosive diarrhea and prominent nipples constitutes satisfying revenge for his having apparently robbed both of them of whatever souls and outside interests they once possessed. It is the most grotesque pantomime of girl power these beautiful women clinking glasses and ultimately trading what must be the weakest and least earned high-five in cinema history after executing a plot made possible by one of their daddies and done with considerably more panache in the painfully generic but at least mildly agreeable 1987 Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success. When we first meet them both Kate (Mann) and Carly (Diaz) believe they are happy women because they are both under the spell such as it is of Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a man with all the inscrutable charisma of a tennis ball with a face drawn on it. Kate babbles at him and pees in front of him and doesnt know she should groom her intimate areas because thats how wives are right? Carly has wine with him at sundown and has lots of impetuous sex with him and talks to her secretary (Nicki Minaj) about him because thats how lady lawyer mistresses are right? (As a side note while the need to advertise the themes of competitive pettiness is understandable it seems like a dreadful missed opportunity that they didnt call this Right Fellas? The Movie. Someone in marketing was not keeping his [probably his] eye on the ball.) The women discover each other at which point the cold one (the one who works in an office) is mercilessly stalked by the baffled out-of-touch nerdy sexless one (the wife) until they become friends and eventually discover the young large-breasted dumb one -- the other mistress Amber played by supermodel Kate Upton. At first the two women over 40 naturally respond to the beautiful woman in her 20s by attempting to physically attack her out of jealousy (right fellas?) but particularly once they learn that Amber is so stupid she doesnt know which end of a pair of binoculars to look through all three team up because they hate Mark and what better animating principle is there for female friendship than being humiliated by the same man and having nothing better to do than feel miserable about it? Now granted all three of these women will ultimately need rescue from men in order to move on to the next phases of their lives -- and again they wouldnt know what to do to Mark without advice they receive from Carlys father (Don Johnson) which he delivers over a meal in a restaurant where Asian women give massages while you eat and feed you by hand. But dont let that harsh your ""sisters are doing it for themselves"" mellow ladies. HERES TO FRIENDSHIP It is a film that features a vomiting scene a farting scene a huge dog taking an extravagant full-view dump on an apartment floor the aforementioned diarrhea and nipple segments a joke -- the approach of which is visible from space -- when a man is sexually humiliated by a transgender woman and plenty of appreciative ogling of Kate Uptons caboose. It does not however manage to pass the Bechdel test the laughably low bar that asks these questions (1) Does a film have two women in it? (2) Do they talk to each other? (3) About something other than a man? Yyyyyyyup. Thats right. The Other Woman is 109 minutes long and at no time do any of these women -- including Carly and her secretary who only know each other from work -- pause for a discussion even for a moment of anything other than a series of dudes Mark Kates brother Carlys father the secretarys husband Carlys other boyfriends. It is truly no fooling all they talk about for 109 minutes. As has often been observed there is nothing about the Bechdel test that is magical plenty of good movies dont pass it and heaven knows plenty of terrible movies do. But the fact that a large studio like Twentieth Century Fox -- not to mention an actual nonjoke director like Nick Cassavetes -- can make an ode to female empowerment that at no time involves any women relating to each other about anything other than men? Its deliciously almost poetically perhaps polemically depressing. The Other Woman is no charming film about lady buddies the way theyd like it to be but it is a gift-wrapped boon to critics who have been looking for an opportunity to explain the miserable circumstances in which genuinely talented comic actresses -- even powerful ones even proven ones even ones doing the absolute best they possibly can -- still very often find themselves. There are isolated funny moments Thats just the truth. Mann is a gloriously unabashedly weird presence in the best way always and Diaz continues to be an often funny mix of glamorous and goofy just like shes been since she was a young actress-model herself. The audience I was with laughed at this movie sometimes. They looked at it -- twice -- and said literally ""This [excrement] is funny."" And were it wrapped around a story that was 50 percent 20 percent even 10 percent less corrosive and gross maybe that would be easier to endorse. I know what youre thinking ""Enough beating around the bush. Just tell us whether you liked it"" Consider this which I will say in terms this movie would understand If you were on an airplane The Other Woman might not be preferable to simply staring into your empty airsick bag but it has enough nicely executed physical comedy that in the event you become ill it is definitely preferable to staring into your occupied airsick bag. This is what weve got girls. This is whats on offer. Use your judgment.

BARRY WETCHER BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The Other WomanStarring Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann Kate Upton Directed by Nick Cassavetes Rated PG-13 for mature thematic material sexual references and language Running time 1 hour 49 minutes Playing In wide release (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitAs a wronged wife teaming up with her husbands ex-lover (Cameron Diaz) for revenge Leslie Mann keeps this crude jury-rigged farce afloat for an hour before it sinks into random acts of stupidity. Grade C ""The Other Woman"" is a coarse rickety comedy and the movies glamorous superstar Cameron Diaz plays the title role - a sexy upright New York lawyer who goes into mission mode when she learns that her serious boyfriend (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is a married man. Its supposed to be irresistibly piquant that she teams up with the mans spouse to punish him. But the movies main attraction is Leslie Mann who plays the wronged wife. Shes been in far better movies (like her real-life husband Judd Apatows ""This Is 40"") but this slipshod revenge farce unleashes her full powers. She comes on like Gracie Allen and the whole First Wives Club rolled into one. If Mann had a director strong enough to modulate her slapstick and her nonstop non sequiturs she might have given a classic farce performance. Even without any help she provides squiggly lines of energy that keep the movie fitfully alive before it goes completely brain-dead. In one of Manns opening riffs she says she needs to attend ""brain camp"" to motivate her gray cells with brain teasers while she scarfs down ""gingko balboa."" When her slick loathsomely narcissistic husband corrects her - ""balboa"" is Rockys last name biloba is gingkos - she doesnt feel put down. Shes delighted that shes proved right about her need for a mental workout. A lot of the movie is like that. Manns crazy performing instincts and her characters open-ended enthusiasm redeem lines and situations that could have been demeaning or outright insulting. When her contractor brother (Taylor Kinney) the one wholesome guy in the movie questions whether she knows what shes doing when she and her new best friend (Diaz) start tracking her lousy spouse she tells him to stop bothering them with ""man logic."" This woman has her own Mann logic. Shes inspired as a ditz and wholehearted as a physical comedian - every time she takes a step its a pratfall waiting to happen. Its tempting to call Mann ""a force of nature"" but whats funniest about her in ""The Other Woman"" is that she isnt natural. Shes like a housewife from the ""I Love Lucy"" era who hurtled through a time warp and has emerged in this millennium wrapped up like a Stepford Wife but with inchoate desires for liberation. The nuttiness of her character gives her an edge on her co-star Diaz who is supposed to be a no-nonsense attorney with a killer instinct. Diaz is amusing when she maintains her cynical edge telling Mann to ""cry on the inside like a winner."" But she soon drops her lawyerly identity with her partner in crime and becomes little more than a curvy straight man. She also melts instantly for her pals contractor brother. In this would-be sisterhood-is-powerful farce the Connecticut hausfrau and the Manhattan hottie enlist another of the villains innocent lovers Kate Upton in their plot to wreck the bad guys life. I assume its meant to be empowering that Diaz and Mann extol the virtues of Uptons voluptuous form. But the movie doesnt know what to do with this amiable model when she isnt bouncing around in a bikini. Before she returns for the forced and formless climax Upton disappears without explanation. It may not be Uptons fault. Storytelling is not the strong suit of screenwriter Melissa Stack or director Nick Cassavetes. (Of course that begs the question What is?) At one point Diaz crashes through a trellis outside Mann and Coster-Waldaus master bedroom. The movie simply leaves the star on her back amid the splinters. Then it lurches on to the next scene. In the first half-hour ""The Other Woman"" elicits groans from the sight of Manns Great Dane defecating on the floor of Diazs all-white Tribeca loft. So its not surprising that the teams antics involve sabotaging Coster-Waldaus digestive system (causing ""a fecal accident"") lacing his breakfast smoothie with estrogen to extend his belly and elongate his nipples and putting hair remover in his shampoo. Eventually the women conspire to bring down his budding illegal enterprises in a climax thats like ""The Firm for Dummies."" The movie treats Don Johnson as Diazs hedonistic much-married father with more respect than it does Nicki Minaj who plays her secretary. The office scenes contain several shots emphasizing her expansive rear end. The last we see of Johnson (spoiler alert) hes with a certain supermodel sporting ""Just Married"" on her bikini bottom. Diaz at one point sums up her teams assets as ""the lawyer the wife the boobs."" All she leaves out is ""the booty.""

In theaters April 25th. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Three women all wronged by the same man team up for revenge. (Rated PG-13 for mature thematic material sexual references and language) BOTTOM LINE A fine cast in this war-of-the-sexes comedy but the humor never digs deep. CAST Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann Kate Upton Nikolaj Coster-Waldau LENGTH 150 In ""The Other Woman"" three women wronged by the same man join forces to seek revenge. They are Kate (Leslie Mann) a coddled clueless wife; Carly (Cameron Diaz) a high-powered but gullible lawyer; and Amber a young bimbo (Sports Illustrated model Kate Upton). Ambers big idea is a swift knee to the guys three-timing groin but Carly has other plans. ""I think were going for something a little bit bigger"" she says. Actually ""The Other Woman"" consistently thinks small. Arriving on the heels of female-driven comedies like ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat"" it aims to put women front and center and to upend male chauvinism in the tradition of ""9 to 5"" or ""The First Wives Club."" Its heroines will form a sisterhood to vanquish their common foe the conniving alpha-male Mark King (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau of ""Game of Thrones"") but the movie scores only minor points leaving larger targets untouched. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Directed by Nick Cassavetes (""Shes So Lovely"") from Melissa Stacks debut screenplay ""The Other Woman"" spends a lot of time on mildly zany slapstick (pratfalls drunken antics) and on prankish sight-gags (female hormones in Marks smoothies). Its characters however never surprise us. Soon after Carly discovers that Mark is married she starts panting after Kates brother Phil (Taylor Kinney). Kate meanwhile is the doormat who must learn to assert her independence though we never actually see her do so. As for Amber her status as a buxom brainless mascot suggests that the screenwriter herself may be clinging to a stereotype or two. Diaz and Mann make for a likable odd couple -- the cynical hottie and the chatty sorority sister -- but ""The Other Woman"" misses many opportunities for deeper comedic truths. It casts its mistress characters as innocent dupes instead of as the compromised women more commonly found in the real world and it never asks what the middle-aged Mark is seeking from his multiple affairs. In this battle-of-the-sexes comedy neither sex feels very real which may be why theres so little to laugh about. _____ MoviesSummers must-see movies PLOT Three women all wronged by the same man team up for revenge. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (mature thematic material sexual references and language) CAST Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann Kate Upton Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.

"The Other Woman showcases three angry women and one train wreck review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Other Woman showcases three angry women and one train wreck reviewThe most fascinating struggle in The Other Woman isnt the one between three aggrieved females and a philandering male. Its the battle director Nick Cassavetes wages between his dramatic indie instincts and his studio-pandering expediency.Cameron Diaz suspects something is up with her boyfriend in The Other Woman.  (Barry Wetcher / 20th Century Fox)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 24 2014The Other WomanStarring Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann Kate Upton Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Don Johnson. At GTA theatres. 109 minutes. PGThe most fascinating struggle in The Other Woman isnt the one between three aggrieved females and a philandering male.Its the one between director Nick Cassavetes screenwriter Melissa Stack editors Jim Flynn and Alan Heim and any number of meddling producers.Article Continued BelowThe actors -- Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann and Kate Upton on one side Game of Thrones Nikolaj Coster-Waldau on the other -- all figure theyre making the big studio romantic comedy that the trailer is selling.Cassavetes and his crew arent so sure. One moment they are indeed making that studio rom-com hitting beats with yuks about public drunkenness projectile bodily fluids inconvenient pet pooches and smartass secretaries. The next theyre drifting along with a serious character-led drama about infidelity thats more in line with the indie film world that Cassavetes (The Notebook Shes So Lovely) hails from.Not helping one bit for either type of movie is a ridiculously on-the-nose soundtrack featuring such overplayed tunes as ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" ""Love Is a Battlefield"" Frank Sinatras ""New York New York"" and the Mission Impossible theme.Gawking at and listening to this mess does make for an interesting sit though much like watching a slow-motion train wreck. And the pairing of Diaz and Mann both great comic actresses suggest the two could really click in a better movie written to properly showcase their talents.The Other Woman begins as the most gilded of romantic fantasies with Robert Fraisses camera gliding through scenic views of New York at its most gorgeous as hot-to-trot lawyer Carly Whitten (Diaz) and her hunky new businessman boyfriend Mark King (Coster-Waldau) fall in bed and in love almost at first sight.Turns out it is pure fantasy. Growing suspicious after Mark gives her a lame excuse for why he must bail on a date and stay at his Connecticut home one night she drops in to surprise him and gets one of her own Marks wife Kate (Mann) answers the door.In real life this would be the opposite of comedy but The Other Woman suddenly shifts into wacky sister mode as the daffy and needy Kate tries to wheedle information and some sympathy out of a backpedalling Carly. After a succession of drinks clothing try-ons and pratfalls that recall Manns slapstick turns in her hubby Judd Apatows films Kate and Carly get serious about wanting to get revenge on Mark who remains oblivious to it all.The movie heads into The First Wives Club territory when Kate and Carly pick up a third enraged accomplice blond beach bunny Amber (Kate Upton) whom Mark has been bedding on his supposed business trips to Florida. Shes introduced running and jiggling into the water as if shes making a Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition video which is where career model Upton does her best acting.Pooling their skills -- ""The lawyer the wife and the boobs ... a perfect killing machine"" -- the three learn that Mark isnt just conning them but also his company to the tune of millions of dollars hidden in a Bahamas bank account. Revenge will be sweet for the women and very gross painful and expensive for Mark.Whats clear from all this is that Mark isnt just a philanderer and thief but an outright sociopath which nullifies both the ""rom"" and ""com"" part of this supposed rom-com. The way he carries on and kudos to Coster-Waldau for accepting such an unlikeable role they might well have dressed him in his medieval attire from Game of Thrones instead of tailored suits.The Other Woman raises serious issues of how men treat women and how women react to infidelity that the more serious side of Cassavetes might have profitably explored.And perhaps he tried (hes certainly no pushover) but got overruled by studio quippers choppers and counters who wanted a popcorn flick replete with such rom-com staples as the mouthy secretary (rapper Nicki Minaj) the rascal dad (Don Johnson) and the good-guy love interest (Taylor Kinney). The only cliches missing to complete the set are the funny gay friend and the meddling mom but the studio is probably saving them for The Other Woman 2.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

All Rights Reserved. Not for sale or duplication. The sexual politics of Nick Cassavetess decidedly un-romantic comedy The Other Woman are intriguingly European and at their core kind of groovy. Wronged Connecticut wifey-wife Kate (Leslie Mann) seeks out her husbands mistress sexy city-slicker and high-powered lawyer Carly (Cameron Diaz) looking to her for answers Why is my husband such an asshole? And can we be besties? Carly who began her relationship with Mr. Infidelity (played with cool Michael Douglasian sleaziness by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) not knowing he was married and cut him off once she got the tip at first wants nothing to do with needy high-strung Kate. But before long the two get cozy and when they discover the philandering hubby has a third mistress they pull her into their unlikely sisterhood too. (Shes played as a likably self-aware ditz by well-known model Kate Upton.) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The basic idea behind The Other Woman is perversely progressive When a straight married man strays in real life the first person his scorned wife usually blames is the vixen who led him to the whoring bed. The underlying assumption sexist at heart is that women are the schemers men the innocent naifs. The Other Woman written by Melissa Stack doesnt immediately buy into that baloney. And ideally it would have provided a showcase for Diaz and Mann both gangly gifted comedians who know their way around a zinger not to mention a pratfall. Each has a terrific moment or two Manns Kate weepily sprawled on the marital bed in her wedding dress squirts Reddi-wip into her mouth straight from the can -- shes a pale fragile meringue of temporary helplessness channeling the lowest-of-the-low feelings modern women are never supposed to entertain but sometimes at least secretly do.Diaz who made such a gloriously unapologetic bad gal in Bad Teacher has fewer opportunities for on-the-edge ridiculousness but shes a good sport all the way. Carly tumbles into the bushes and -- surprise -- breaks off the heel of her shoe; she sprints goofily across a beach a crazy windmill of arms and legs. But The Other Woman doesnt give these actresses much to do except look ridiculous if not sneaky and conniving. And in the end they do what all women in comedies like this must They pull their lives together and clink glasses over how awesome they are without ever going to the trouble of being genuinely awesome.Film Details The Other Woman RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time109 More Info Trailer 1 Kate Upton in The Other Woman.Photo by Barry Wetcher - (c) 2014 - Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.

(Barry Wetcher/AP) By Ann Hornaday April 24 2014 Follow AnnHornaday ""The Other Woman"" a misbegotten pseudo-feminist revenge comedy bears traces of a lineage that goes at least as far back as ""The Women"" and includes such now-near-classics as ""9 to 5"" and ""The First Wives Club."" The premise -- a group of wronged women confecting revenge on a caddish man -- hews faithfully to Hollywoods most cherished cake-and-eat-it proposition wherein a film can make its female characters as shrewish ditzy and cartoonishly desperate as it wants without fear of recrimination because no matter how bad the gals look the guys look worse. That formula is taken to bizarre extremes in a movie that despite presenting itself as a celebration of womens solidarity doesnt seem to like women very much. ""The Other Woman"" stars Cameron Diaz as Carly a no-nonsense smokin hot Manhattan lawyer who discovers that her boyfriend Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is married. When Marks spacey wife Kate (Leslie Mann) finally twigs to the affair she shows up at Carlys office and proceeds to collapse into a bundle of blubbering sobs. Unmoved Carly orders her out but Kates not finished Shell have at least a few more hysterically pitched scenes often lubricated by copious helpings of white wine tequila and/or vodka quite possibly accompanied by shots of Reddi-wip administered straight from the can. In case youre wondering Yes youve seen that before. Just like youve seen the montage (set to what else Cyndi Laupers ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"") in which a group of scorned women spike a guys smoothie with estrogen replace his shampoo with Nair and muddle his cocktails with laxatives. ""The Other Woman"" the unpromising screenwriting debut of Melissa Stack seems to have been cobbled together from any number of other not necessarily better movies resulting in a tonal mish-mash of scatology physically contorting pratfalls and only occasionally genuinely observant behavioral comedy. In what seems to be a feature-length limbo contest for cheap laughs its difficult to decide where ""The Other Woman"" goes lowest the shot of a Great Dane relieving itself on a pristine apartment floor or later a needlessly protracted sequence of Coster-Waldau relieving himself -- over and over and over again -- in a restaurant bathroom stall. While its true that most of the movies weaknesses start with the script the enterprise is made all the more wobbly by Nick Cassavetess unsure direction The man who made such assured films as ""Shes So Lovely"" ""Alpha Dog"" and ""The Notebook"" here veers way out of his element awkwardly navigating the films physical comedy and never quite selling the empowerment thats supposedly at its core. Kate Upton the generously figured swimsuit model who plays Amber one of Marks many mistresses provides some luscious eye candy in ""The Other Woman"" with her introductory scene on a Southampton beach recalling Bo Derek in ""10."" Here the sequence is played for sly laughs as Diazs character realizing shes been bested by ""a double-D lemon tart"" reflexively tries to outpace her rival in sexaphonic slow-mo glory. ""I like that shes super-hot"" Kate says later about the pretty vacant Amber. ""I feel like she brings up our group average."" Thats one of the best lines in ""The Other Woman"" and one of the rare instances in which Mann is allowed to resemble something other than the endlessly nattering chatterbox she portrays -- at an annoyingly hysterical pitch -- through most of the movie. For her part Diaz so often the most underrated element of any film shes in lends a commendable degree of unforced even slightly believable warmth to a character whos otherwise an icily forbidding stereotype. Although ""The Other Woman"" nibbles around the edges of revealing truths about relationships it leaves most of that potential behind instead pursuing easy exhausted cliches about zip-less marriages upper class suburban drudgery cynical careerism and dumb-but-sweet blondes. (Upton may not be able to act her way out of a paper bag but the filmmakers are counting on audiences not looking at the bag.) Somewhere inside all of ""The Other Womans"" tasteful interiors posh seaside locales and slapstick stridency there is a decent movie about female competition and friendship. Instead viewers are treated to a movie as generic and forgettable as the sofa-size art on its characters walls.  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains mature thematic material sexual references and profanity. 109 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"The Other Woman movie review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Review The Other Woman  1/2Revenge is a dish best served with cold drinks and pratfallsApril 24 2014|Michael PhillipsScene from ""The Other Woman."" (Barry Wetcher)Hollywood years are like dog years which means 17 years is a long time. Seventeen years ago Cameron Diaz played the chipper second banana the other woman in the Julia Roberts vehicle ""My Best Friends Wedding."" While that movie really belonged to Rupert Everett the sunny goodwill flying out of every single one of Diazs pores cast a nice warm glow over the Chicago-filmed diversion.Diaz has long since proven she can tackle various leading roles and in the unsteady revenge comedy ""The Other Woman"" Diaz finds herself running the show in a Sarah Jessica Parker ""Sex and the City"" sort of way. It lies at the midpoint between the black-comic nastiness of a ""Bad Teacher"" (which she was in) and the raunchy but sweet realm of a good blessedly female-driven ensemble project such as ""Bridesmaids"" (which she was not). Written by newcomer Melissa K. Stack ""The Other Woman"" offers roughly equal parts wit and witlessness casual smarts and jokes lingering and detailed regarding explosive bowel movements. Based on that ratio Id say the screenwriters future in Hollywood looks pretty good.Re-rated PG-13 down from an R on appeal the film stars Diaz (the blond one) along with Leslie Mann (the blond one) and Kate Upton (the blond one). Carly Whitten the Diaz character is a high-flying Manhattan attorney two months into a lovely affair with a new man (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau a ""Game of Thrones"" regular and graduate of the Ewan McGregor School of Charismatic Smarm). His money suspicious in its origins comes from something to do with start-up companies and websites. Visiting Marks Connecticut home one night dressed as a stripper-plumber Carly learns her beau is married though Mark remains unaware that the women in his life are getting hep to his hectic step. Carly and Marks wife Kate (Mann) form an alliance once they realize the weasel is weaseling with a third younger va-voomier specimen (Upton).Where does it go from there? All over the place. As these three become one and hatch their revenge schemes half-heartedly the movie -- directed by Nick Cassavetes in an ever-shifting variety of tones and styles -- attempts to deliver a little something for everyone. Pathos Mann in wrenching close-up in bed as she realizes her marriage is shot. Fashion ""Sex and the City"" costume designer Patricia Field throws every thread she can at her photogenic triad braking just short of drag-queen territory. Alcohol There is a lot of drinking in this movie in the neighborhood of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" intake levels though without the fatal side effects.A 20th Century Fox promotional Twitter account recently encouraged the films target audience ""grab the girls book ur tickets amp; let us know what you think"" Many films come to mind watching this one among them ""Working Girl"" (Nicki Minaj the rapper/singer glides through the role of Carlys assistant) and ""The First Wives Club."" The repartee ranges from leisurely discussions of personal landscaping to faintly hypocritical soul-searching regarding love and fulfillment. Primarily the movie is selling teeth and clothing. Still line to line its fresher than any number of guy-centric ""Hangover""-spawned affairs despite director Cassavetes lack of flair for slapstick. Diaz remains a game physical comic even when her two-headed films asking no more of her than to dance or stumble into some bushes.mjphillipstribune.com""The Other Woman"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for mature thematic material sexual references and language)Running time 149Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesWhos the Funniest Actress in The Other Woman?

She plays Kate King who gave up her own career to help further that of her hunky husband Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).Hes rich hes handsome and hes cheating on her as Kate discovers the night ice-queen lawyer Carly (Cameron Diaz) shows up at their door dressed like a stripper plumber (dont ask).Kate is shattered but needy and goads Carly by way of constant begging into an awkward friendship. Mark isnt aware that either of them knows whats up. Soon Kate and Carly discover that there is yet another woman Amber (Kate Upton) much younger and shapelier.So the three women band together not just to help Kate rid herself of Mark but to make him suffer along the way. Which is kind of ridiculous sure but this is a romantic comedy and offbeat buddy movie so strict adherence to reality isnt exactly a requirement.And although the schemes are as dumb as the overall idea with idiotic spying adventures and Nair in Marks shampoo and yes why not laxatives in his liquor (they were doing this better 30 years ago in ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"") the lack of originality isnt whats most troubling about the film written by Melissa Stack. Worse is the notion that none of these women is strong enough to handle the situation by themselves. At one point Carly even tells Kate that the two of them combine to make the perfect woman. Really. What else could Mark want?Sex of course which is what Amber who is portrayed as a sweet idiot with a big bust size represents in not-so-subtle terms.Slicing through all of this sometimes vaguely sometimes not demeaning representation of female friendship is Manns performance as Kate. On the serious side Kate is a woman who has defined herself in terms of her husband for so long she isnt really sure how to step out of that role even when presented with devastating evidence of his infidelity and all-around jerk-face behavior.On the not-so-serious side Mann is frequently hilarious. She often plays the wife in husband Judd Apatows comedies and yes shes the wife here. But she takes over this movie. Its not that her characters actions are any more believable than anyone elses particularly when the film devolves into slapstick. Its just that she is really funny spouting what sound like improvised asides (dont miss the under-her-breath worries about not handling prison as well as Martha Stewart).Is it enough to make ""The Other Woman"" a good movie? Oh no; certainly not. But it makes it a lot better than it might have been.The Other WomanDirector Nick Cassavetes.Cast Leslie Mann Cameron Diaz Kate Upton.Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material sexual references and language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

April 25 2014 -- 140pm Barry Wetcher Associated Press - Ap This image released by 20th Century Fox shows Leslie Mann from left Nicki Minaj Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton in a scene from ""The Other Woman."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert In ""The Other Woman"" they throw everything at the wall to see what sticks. Most of it does. Its an escapist womens empowerment comedy like many others but elevated by the simple virtue of being for most of its length very very funny. Set in an upper-class milieu of sleek Manhattan condos designer clothes and pristine Caribbean beaches the story follows three women who realize theyre being triple-timed by a cad and join forces to deliver his comeuppance. Cameron Diaz plays the brains of the operation a sharp-tongued killer attorney in a whirlwind romance with a handsome executive (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). Leslie Mann is his blithely daffy wife who is also unaware of his duplicity. When the women discover each others existence the comic sparks fly. The characters are surprisingly well developed for this sort of genre fare. Diaz plays her character as a woman of steely intelligence and cynical wit an alpha female used to stiff-arming her adversaries and bailing out of unsatisfactory emotional entanglements. Melissa Stacks bright farcical screenplay gives this go-getter plenty of tart ammunition. Mann an exuberant comedian makes a feast of her role the wronged wife as an innocent oversharing catalyst of chaos. Its a career-best performance for Mann a fizzy brew of vulnerability and pluck. Smiling a bit desperately dressed in too-chipper florals she blathers on with the spazzy attention-starved energy of a yapping Chihuahua. When she tracks down Diaz its not for a resentful wife vs. rival showdown but because she needs to talk -- in breathy-voiced torrents. Since her husband barely notices her she needs someone anyone else to fill the void even if its his mistress. Diaz whose character can be a bit of a shrew reluctantly assents to a conversation but with a one-hour time limit and the understanding that ""were not going to braid each others hair."" They do of course during an all-nighter with tequila shots but the very inevitability of the gag gives their giggly-weepy coming together an ironic charge. Jaded viewer that I am I found myself thinking ""I cant believe Im laughing at this stuff"" and laughing nonetheless. Matt Sayles Associated Press - Matt Sayles/invision/ap Leslie Mann and from left Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton arrive at the Los Angeles premiere of ""The Other Woman"" at the Regency Village Westwood on Monday April 21 2014. In another nice touch the women arent immediately hell-bent on retaliating against Coster-Waldau. Diaz declares that ""monogamy isnt a natural state"" and wants to move ahead with her life. Mann vacillates more than half ready to preserve her hollow but privileged status quo. But when they spot him with yet another other woman (Sports Illustrated cover girl Kate Upton) they recruit her in a plan to teach him a painful lesson or three. The film has its share of defects. Its overlong by a good 15 minutes and loses steam in the third act just when things should be gathering momentum. The musical cues are regrettably obvious (the ""Mission Impossible"" theme in a detective interlude a maudlin cover of ""La Vie en Rose"" for a passage of romantic letdown). As a model/actress Upton is no Brooklyn Decker. Still the overall tone is of buoyant good cheer and jazzy spontaneity. Director Nick Cassavetes (""The Notebook"") encourages his actors to perform their hearts out and most of them deliver above-average work in return. The pert nimble Mann and wisecracking Diaz have a sparkling comedic chemistry; they seem to enjoy each others company. As Diazs sassy assistant and confidante rapper Nicki Minaj is all kinds of awesome. And special credit to Coster-Waldau as a liar who has learned to fake sincerity brilliantly. When he acts repentant after being exposed he half-fools us too. Even in an explosive ""Dumb and Dumber"" toilet scene he brings his A Game. That people is acting.

Photo Barry Wetcher Associated Press Image 8 of 8 The Other Woman review Smart comedy with edge 1 / 8 Back to Gallery The Other Woman Comedy. Starring Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann and Kate Upton. Directed by Nick Cassavetes. (PG-13. 109 minutes.) Far from a silly romance ""The Other Woman"" is a harsh revenge comedy that pairs Cameron Diaz in her recent acerbic mode and Leslie Mann in her deepest and funniest role to date. Written on the knife edge between farce and naturalism by newcomer Melissa K. Stack its directed with precision and balance by Nick Cassavetes and put over expertly by the cast. The advertisements might look dumb but the movie isnt. The first bit of good news is Cameron Diaz who - just in the last few years - has stopped smiling all the time and shaving 50 points off her IQ. The Diaz we find here is confident impatient and queenly as a 40ish lawyer in what seems like an idyllic romance with a handsome businessman (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). As Carly Diaz has the magnetism and hauteur of a movie star and so when she finds out that the boyfriend is married she drops him cold. Shes ready to move on. But the mans wife wants to be friends with her. Shocked and devastated by her husbands treachery the wife (Leslie Mann) has absolutely no one she can confide in - except for her husbands former lover. From there slowly but believably and at first against Carlys will the two become friends ... and then start thinking of ways to get even. More in Movies Walking With the Enemy review Holocaust in Hungary Teenage review Love song to adolescence Alan Partridge review Radio career hits static comically Dancing in Jaffa review Ballroom dancers Middle East solution The character of the wronged wife is the movies best creation and Manns performance is its revelation. Mann has always been funny but her performances have been usually within a particular range playing off a sort of harried but knowing comic persona. But here shes playing someone naive and zany and needy who cant shut up and is slightly ridiculous. At the same time she must also be hurt and worthwhile and serious - the carrier of the movies emotion. If you see ""The Other Woman"" watch Mann and dont take her for granted. Watch what shes doing - or rather how much shes doing simultaneously. Her line readings seem intuitive and spontaneous guided by some unerring sense of comic timing. Yet while nailing every laugh she ropes in aspects of the characters history too. The pain of her betrayal. Her anger at letting herself get talked out of having children. This is the ideal comic synthesis - all the laughs on the surface but with all the pain underneath. Later the women meet up with another other woman a very young blonde named Amber (of course) and played by Kate Upton who becomes the junior partner in the trio. Upton isnt nearly as skilled as Diaz or Mann but her role is pretty basic to play a nice person who isnt very bright. Upton plays stupid so well that she must be smart. Audiences looking for a nonstop laugh riot may be disappointed but the big laughs are there and they benefit from the movies underlying sincerity. ""The Other Woman"" isnt quite as good as ""Bridesmaids"" - its neither as funny nor ultimately as serious - but its in that general area of aspiration and its characters arent cartoons. A couple of scenes near the finish feel padded. Just when the movie feels as if it should be hurtling for the climax it lingers for seven or eight minutes on extraneous things. But thats about the worst that could be said for ""The Other Woman."" The best is that Melissa K. Stack is a screenwriter to watch and that Leslie Manns performance has the fullness of life.

(Barry Wetcher) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday April 23 2014 213 PM Title The Other Woman Film Info With Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann Kate Upton. A serially cheating playboy gets his comeuppance. Director Nick Cassavetes (149). PG-13 Sexuality language. Area theaters. The conventional rom-com -- you know the kind that usually ends with an airport proposal -- was driven into the ground by too many lazy efforts. But Hollywood loves familiar formulas so it was inevitable that somebody would find a way to revisit the genre. Rather than upgrading the much-maligned ""chick flick"" genre with creativity and wit the makers of ""The Other Woman"" have simply repackaged it. So instead of the rom-com we now have the ""non-com."" The cardboard characters and predictable rhythms remain. But this time we get all the comic cliches with none of the romance. At least Leslie Mann Nicki Minaj Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton (l.-r.) find something amusing in ""The Other Woman."" (Barry Wetcher) Kate Upton Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann (l.-r.) toast their devious plan in ""The Other Woman."" (Barry Wetcher) Cameron Diaz plays a lawyer who learns her new boyfriend is married in ""The Other Woman."" (Barry Wetcher) Cameron Diaz plays Carly a high-powered lawyer stunned to learn her new boyfriend Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is married. After meeting his wife Kate (Leslie Mann) Carly wants to move swiftly on. But Kate is devastated She has dedicated her entire life to her husband and their suburban home. Kate convinces Carly to spy on Mark and find out what other secrets hes hiding. After they catch him with Amber (supermodel Kate Upton) all three ladies decide to take him down. Diaz and Mann are required to mug so broadly that their characters have no connection to any living human being. We last saw this shamelessly recycled idea in the (lousy) 2006 comedy ""John Tucker Must Die"" which was about high school students. Its hardly an improvement to watch adult women drop everything to fanatically obsess over a sleazy playboy. Screenwriter Melissa Stack takes the easy way out in every scene but whats worse is her disdain for her own characters. Kate is a brainless Stepford wife Amber is a blank mannequin who exists solely for bikini scenes and Carly is reduced to tripping over her heels and face-planting into shrubs. Kate Uptons character in ""The Other Woman"" exists solely for bikini scenes. (Barry Wetcher) Director Nick Cassavetes should know better. Why is the guy who made ""The Notebook"" -- a guilty pleasure sure but an intelligent and heartfelt one -- treating his cast and audience with so little respect? Diaz and Mann work remarkably hard to add some buoyancy to the flat script. But theyre required to mug so broadly that their characters have no connection to any living human being. As often happens in subpar comedies the sidekicks are the best characters. Nicki Minaj is amusing as Carlys cynical assistant and Don Johnson is delightful as her Lothario dad Frank. In the end stunning Amber falls in love with Frank -- because ultimately movies like this are exercises in wish fulfillment. Not what viewers want but what studio execs wish theyd want. After all its a lot harder to create fresh ideas than to dress up old ones and call them new. eweitzmannydailynews.com On a mobile device? Click to watch the clip from the movie.

"The Other Woman (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Other Woman (PG-13) A funny comedy about three women who pay back the playboy whos been playing them. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com4/24/2014 Editor rating 3 I know what youre thinking She has lost her mind. Theres no way that comedy about the women who seek revenge on the good-looking guy who wrongs them can actually be entertaining. Weve seen it a million times Plus were still pretty annoyed with Leslie Mann after This is 40 even if that was mostly her husbands fault. The Other Woman though is definitely funny. Goofy ridiculous with more gross-out humor than is strictly necessary but still funny. It falls into the category of Girlfriend Films -- as in go with your girlfriends and leave your date/partner/spouse at home with the PlayStation or the NBA playoffs or the new Malcolm Gladwell book. If you drink have a glass of wine first. And you will laugh. Cameron Diaz who gets more compliments for her hot body than her extraordinary gift for physical comedy stars as Carly a Manhattan attorney who finally has shed her stable of boyfriends for new guy Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau most recently seen doing something unspeakable to his sister on Game of Thrones). Mark is handsome charming thoughtful smart -- and married which Carly discovers after an impromptu visit to his Connecticut home in full slutty plumber gear. His wife Kate (Mann) answers the door and after a frantic bumbling explanation and a snapped high heel Carly makes her escape. But she doesnt escape really because Kate undone at the realization her perfect husband is a philanderer starts stalking Carly showing up at her office and apartment with her Great Dane puppy in tow. The dog is a distraction and not particularly amusing but Manns constant weeping and ebb-and-flow hysteria is a thing of beauty. An impatient but inwardly guilty Carly grudgingly bears Kates clingy ways -- literally as the needy unraveling Kate is constantly grabbing her and hugging her and trying to climb her like shes a tree. But gradually the women become friends and they grow even closer when they discover Mark is seeing a third woman. What happens when they follow him to the Hamptons and spy her in person -- shes played by supermodel Kate Upton whose white bikini scene may end up the stuff of movie legend -- results in one of funniest scenes Ive seen this year. (""Im glad shes hot. She brings up our group average"" the suddenly practical Kate assures the now-furious Carly.) The women do get around to terrorizing Mark like the trailers suggest but that happens later than you expect. Watching them sneak estrogen into his power shakes and laxatives into his Scotch is amusing but the best scenes happen with Mark offstage with Diazs channeling her power bitch moves and pratfalling and Mann trying to ""cry on the inside"" and failing miserably. Their interplay has an improvisational feel but its never slapdash or sloppy. And this is not to say Coster-Waldau doesnt get his own comic moments during a bad night in the mens room and at the eventual confrontation with his former lovers. The Other Woman even gets the comic cliches right. Don Johnson gets a few laughs as Carlys louche father and Nicki Minaj brings a snappy vibe to the role of Sassy Black Assistant. Even Taylor Kinney arriving in the form of Kates conveniently good-looking single brother doesnt derail the movie from its delightful girl power objective.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For much of its first act The Other Woman plays like an attempt to revive the talky sexless sex comedies of a bygone era. The sketchy plot involving a housewife who bonds with one of her husbands mistresses is brushed off-screen to make room for quippy circular chatter. Compositions consist largely of blank space; interiors are designed in neutral grays and whites which makes nearly every scene look like its set in a hospital. Its more mildly classy than clever and the way the film glamorizes its characters shoe closets and fancy cars hearkens back to a time when studios understood that just because people wanted to see upper-middle-class life it didnt mean they related to it on a personal level. Then all of a sudden a spotted Great Dane squats in the middle of a Manhattan apartment and out plop several gleaming glistening CGI turds. Its one of those cases where a Hollywood movie inadvertently summarizes itself in a single shot. The Other Womans floor-soiling Great Dane is the one-two of its second half which find newly minted friends Carly (Cameron Diaz) and Kate (Leslie Mann) joining forces with second mistress Amber (Kate Upton whose ditziness is signaled by a shot in which she tries to look through a pair of binoculars backwards) to exact revenge against Kates husband in the name of some broad test-audience-friendly notion of empowerment. Said revenge plot consists of pumping him full of laxatives and hormones and fooling him into consenting to a threesome with a bearded drag queen. There are some fart sound effects transphobic punchlines and a Cronenbergian long take of serial cheater Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) yawlping and yawling as he shits his brains out in a bathroom stall but not much in the way of comedy. The result is tolerable only because of Manns performance as the manic fidgety Kate. The actress is of above average height but looks tiny next to Diaz and Upton. Showing a real knack for physical comedy she plays up her comparative smallness contorting and bending herself while Diaz and Upton remain poised. Incidentally The Other Woman goes out of its way to point out that Amber and Carly are not technically mistresses because they didnt know about Marks marriage to Kate and that real consenting mistresses are the absolute scum of the Earth. This kind of prudishness quickly becomes irritating. The tame opening stretch--with its focus on unlikely friendship--feels transgressive in comparison to the bodily dysfunction-centric later scenes which reiterate the same stuffy (and patronizing) points about monogamy and the importance of finding the right man. Somewhere around the 60-minute mark director Nick Cassavetes--whose career makes one wish that John Cassavetes had been a better father--pushes the movie into Tyler Perry territory with the final third playing as a tone-deaf mixture of wish fulfillment punishment and bawdy innuendo.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW The Other Woman For cheats sake. Running time 110 min. Rated PG-13 (language gross-out humor). At the Empire 34th St. others. Playing like a script thats been moldering since Diane Keaton turned it down in 1983 ""The Other Woman"" is a weak adultery rom-com in which the most authentic performance comes from a non-housebroken Great Dane. The premise basically is that the best way to deal with a cheater is to devote every waking minute to thinking about him. Screenwriter Melissa Stack and director Nick Cassavetes (""The Notebook"" ""My Sisters Keeper"") do wrong by all three women here Cameron Diazs prickly businesswoman Leslie Manns irritating crybaby of a housewife and certainly poor Kate Upton whos actually referred to at one point as ""The Boobs."" And its really been a rough week for Nikolaj Coster-Waldau coming off Sundays ""Game of Thrones"" rape-scene controversy who mugs his way through a series of unfunny comeuppances -- including a thoroughly icky bathroom scene. We begin as Carly (Diaz) a Manhattan lawyer falls for the dashing Mark (Coster-Waldau) who seems too good to be true. And he is she discovers when she shows up unannounced at his Connecticut home Hes got a wife (Mann) and at least one other mistress (Upton). Manns Kate a slight variation on her role in ""Knocked Up"" and ""This Is 40"" -- her signature moves seem to be rambling semi-coherently and peeing with the door open -- does not take the news well melting down upon confronting Carly. Despite their differences the two eventually bond over their antipathy for Mark and hatch a revenge scheme. Kate Upton -- who The Posts Sara Stewart reports is ""actually referred to at one point as The Boobs "" -- stars as another of Nikolaj Coster-Waldaus characters mistresses.Photo Twentieth Century Fox Mann and Diaz give it their all and you can see how they might be a good comic team with better material Mann a goofy foil to Diazs savvy urbanite (""Cry on the inside like a winner"" she barks at a whimpering Kate). But its frustrating to sit through a film in which one simple conversation would negate everything that transpires. Instead of confronting her mendacious spouse Kate enlists Carly in a weeks-long campaign of subterfuge employing such novel tactics as Nair in the shampoo bottle and laxatives in the whiskey. Cassavetes also relies heavily on tired visual shorthand. We know Carly is a career woman because she wears all black and stilettos; we know Mark is an alpha male because he drives a sports car. We know Uptons the eye candy because shes running down the beach in slow motion ""Baywatch""-style. Most egregiously we can tell the gals are in spy mode because the ""Mission Impossible"" theme is playing. (This is the second-worst musical cue the first being ""New York New York"" to signify a return to the city.) And oh the cringeworthy physical comedy the preponderance of pratfalls. Most oddly Diaz and Mann get into a shoving match that seems invented by an adolescent boy. (""What if they like bump boobs?"") It all comes to an ugly end for Coster-Waldau whose last moments on-screen might charitably be considered an homage to Ed Rooney of ""Ferris Bueller."" Taylor Kinney as Kates affable brother is fine but has little to do besides look cute and Don Johnson gets a couple of unremarkable scenes as Carlys girl-crazy dad. Nicki Minaj is sort of delightful in a teensy role as Carlys assistant. Id rather have just followed her story. On a side note Im curious about Cassavetes obsession with sunglasses -- I noted about 12 different pairs on Mann alone. Who besides Lady Gaga changes shades that often? They say the eyes are the windows to the soul so maybe its his way of covering up its total absence in this joyless affair.

TWITTER Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann exact revenge on a cheating cad of a husband in Nick Cassavetes adultery comedy. Three women stick it to the man who stuck it to all of them in The Other Woman a female solidarity adultery comedy thats three parts embarrassing farce to one part genuinely comic discharge. Making erratic use of its promising central premise as well as of its uniformly attractive cast this slick package is nowhere near as good as it could have been but will still hold considerable appeal for female audiences who will enjoy a good joke at the expense of the cheatin man while men may not mind going along as well just to check out Kate Upton this generations 10. For a film conceived by a woman first-time screenwriter Melissa K. Stack and devoted to women getting back at a serial seducer a great deal of the running time here is devoted to the leading ladies making absolute fools of themselves over the guy who thinks hes getting away with cheating on all of them. Of course its all part of the set-up for him finally getting payback which he does in spades. But it would have helped if director Nick Cassavetes had something resembling a sure hand at comedy. Its almost as if the funny scenes happen virtually by chance like a lucky roll of the dice with some decently written scenes not getting the laughs they should and other silly ones eliciting comic snorts thanks to an actors passing gesture or delivery. STORY Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann Embrace Girl Power at The Other Woman Premiere The snake in the grass here is Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a successful investment banker type who at the outset enjoys an idyllic fling with Carly (Cameron Diaz) a Manhattan attorney whos been around enough to know how to handle herself. One thing shes not accustomed to however is being played for a fool which she becomes upon learning that Mark has long been married to Kate (Leslie Mann) a Connecticut housewife and ditz who suggests she needs to attend ""brain camp"" and enters into a prolonged seizure when she finds out about her husband and the hot-to-trot blonde. Most of Kates breakdown is played out in Carlys presence as the film becomes a virtual two-hander for nearly a half-hour with Kate barging into Carlys fancy office the two having drinks going to Carlys apartment (where Kate doesnt want to sit anywhere Carly and Mark might have had sex which pretty much rules out everywhere) and generally bonding over a shared grievance to the point where they feel not like rivals or enemies but sisters in outrage and potential vengeance. To be sure Kate is a weeping whining and winging pain whom Mann makes into even more of a nut case than she is on paper. As if still in one of her husband Judd Apatows films she marches right into the bathroom at the beginning and sits down to take a pee lets her Great Dane make out with her in Carlys view and generally carries on at such a high pitch you can almost sympathize with her husbands need to get away from time to time just as you can agree with Carly that enoughs enough already. But shes also lovable offbeat and massively self-deprecating to the point that Carly is ultimately moved to help Kate with the divorce and a bit of spying. VIDEO The Other Woman Trailer Carly has also noticed that Kate has quite the cute brother Phil (Taylor Kinney) from whose place on Southampton Beach they can observe Mark whos now secretly involved with much younger knockout Amber (Upton). One of the films more unseemly moments has the normally self-possessed Carly coming completely unglued and falling all over herself upon seeing the massively jiggling Amber jogging down the beach (in Bo Derek-like slow motion no less). But she turns out to be a nice girl and while less pissed than the older women about having been betrayed by Mark she agreeably joins them in their plotting against a man who obviously doesnt recognize something good when hes got it. As Kate puts it in one of the scripts better lines ""I feel like she ups our group average."" On the screenwriting downside however is the issue that a seducer as rampant as Mark has had to have behaved like this his whole life and certainly throughout his long marriage to Kate. But except very briefly at the end theres no broaching this point and even if Kate has been too blind to see it its something a woman as wise to the ways of the world as Carly would have noticed. Worse once the man gets his comeuppance his reaction is embarrassingly babyish that of a little boy who doesnt get his way. Stack may have been trying to make a point about some modern men here but the satisfaction of the womens ultimate victory is undercut by how unbelievable and worse unfunny Marks excruciatingly prolonged reaction is. Just before this unsatisfactory climax the film has already taken a nosedive with a series of scenes that are cued entirely to an unharmonious collection of musical snippets; theres hardly any dialogue or dramatic development to this ungainly stretch of scenes as the group returns from the Bahamas to New York. PHOTOS The Other Woman Premiere Cameron Diaz Leslie Mann and Kate Upton Dazzle on the Carpet For the films humor to have gone over at all which it does in spurts Diaz and Mann had to be totally game and they are that without question. Both grate at certain moments but theyre funny and ingratiating too certainly willing to look foolish in the knowledge that theyre playing for the winning team. Upton does what shes called upon to do look great in a bikini and rarely has more than one line to speak at a time. Game of Thrones star Coster-Waldau has no trouble convincing us that hes the sort of cad who can score whenever and wherever he wants although the actor who may turn the most heads is Kinney (TVs Chicago Fire) as the available brother. Don Johnson appears briefly as the fives-times-married father of Carly to whom she unaccountably listens for romantic advice.

Cameron Diaz plays the cool brittle yin to Leslie Manns weepy whiny yang in ""The Other Woman"" an ungainly often flat-footed yet weirdly compelling romantic dramedy about two gals who become unlikely best friends when they realize theyre being screwed (literally) by the same man. Like a watered-down ""Diabolique"" or a younger-skewing ""First Wives Club"" this latest mainstream rebound from director Nick Cassavetes (after his dead-on-arrival 2012 indie ""Yellow"") taps into the pleasures of sisterly solidarity and righteous revenge Beneath the wobbly pratfalls and the scatological setpieces theres no denying the films mean-spirited kick or its more-than-passing interest in what makes its women tick. These qualities should stand the slickly packaged Fox release in good stead with always-underserved female viewers as another superhero-filled summer gets under way. High-powered New York attorney Carly Whitten (Diaz) doesnt suffer fools gladly or take dating too seriously so its clearly a big deal when she makes it to eight weeks with a handsome businessman who goes by the none-too-subtle name of Mark King (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). But Carlys suspicion that the relationship might be too good to be true turns out to be well founded Dropping by to surprise him one night at his home in Connecticut she instead has an awkward first encounter with Kate (Mann) who shes shocked to learn is Marks wife. Furious and disgusted but also calm and practical Carly immediately resolves to dump Mark and move on. But Kate isnt quite so ready to sever ties with her husbands unwitting mistress Over the next few days she turns up at Carlys law firm -- and later her apartment -- in various states of inebriated distress longing for details about Mark and Carlys sexual habits as well as advice on how to proceed. While Carly initially recoils from Kates extreme neediness and insecurity its not long before the desperate housewife and the put-together career woman realize they have more in common than they thought bonding over their loneliness their mutual loathing for the man who brought them together and inevitably their desire for payback. Things get kicked up a notch when Kate and Carly tailing Mark on one of his many weekend ""business trips"" (to the tune of Lalo Schifrins ""Mission Impossible"" theme) find out that the cad has yet another mistress on layaway Amber (Kate Upton) a young blonde bombshell whos introduced running on the beach in slo-mo oglevision. In a development that works better onscreen than it sounds on paper Amber turns out to be sweet and wholly sympathetic if mildly ditzy and she happily joins Kate and Carlys vengeful sisterhood. Observing all this from the sidelines meanwhile is Kates sensitive good-looking brother Phil (Taylor Kinney) who serves as not only a convenient new love interest for Carly but also the movies token acknowledgment that not all men are lying cheating scumbuckets. For that matter theres room to argue over whether ""The Other Woman"" (the first-produced screenplay by Melissa K. Stack whose ""I Want to F-- Your Sister"" landed on the 2007 Black List) is ultimately a femme-empowering celebration of decency and monogamy or a hopelessly retrograde portrait of scheming backbiting women incapable of defining themselves apart from a man even if its a man they happen to despise. Certainly theres something queasy-making even sadistic about the increasingly juvenile shenanigans that take over the movies second half as Carly Kate and Amber effectively drop a series of anvils on Marks head -- whether theyre slipping him laxatives and estrogen tablets or investigating the offshore bank accounts where hes stashed away an ill-gotten fortune. As it winds its way toward an unexpectedly grisly final showdown ""The Other Woman"" often feels stranded between gross-out comedy romantic fantasy and distaff psychodrama in a way that compels fascination and impatience alike. The films structure and pacing feel haphazard at best the musical choices clumsily tacked on the raunchy elements weak and unnecessary (and likely compromised by the films downgrading from an R rating to a PG-13). One moment were in the Bahamas admiring the beachfront scenery as lensed by d.p. Robert Fraisse; the next were in a toilet stall watching (and worse listening) as a character noisily evacuates his bowels. Similarly there are moments when Cassavetes seems to be operating on Hollywood-hack autopilot and others when you can almost feel him nudging the production in the sort of rougher more offbeat character-driven direction that his famous father John might well have encouraged. This unevenness has become perhaps Cassavetes defining aspect as a filmmaker evident in his unpredictable choice of material (""The Notebook"" ""Alpha Dog"" ""My Sisters Keeper"") and in the curious jumble of moods and styles he achieves with almost every picture. Indeed its this sense of tonal clash that largely distinguishes ""The Other Woman"" which feels like a movie productively at war with itself taking its cues from the temperaments of its two central characters Its lurching and volatile one minute judgmental and calculating the next. And its a testament to the actresses involved that we emerge with an appreciably strong sense of who their characters are. Her nerve endings almost continually exposed her mouth running like crazy Mann at first seems to be channeling the ball-busting housewife she played in ""Knocked Up"" and ""This Is 40"" but she swiftly establishes Kate as a very different creature -- warm and compassionate and genuinely torn over whether to salvage or further sabotage her marriage. As ever Manns ability to seem perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown can be maddening even mannered and ""The Other Woman"" needs every drop of cool cynical detachment it can wring from Diazs performance. Having memorably embraced her inner rebel in recent projects like ""Bad Teacher"" and ""The Counselor"" Diaz (who starred in Cassavetes ""My Sisters Keeper"")is in fine nuanced form here stepping into the heels of a strong-willed successful working woman without reducing her to a one-note shrew. Model-turned-actress Upton (""The Three Stooges"" ""Tower Heist"") holds her own in a likable if limited role and Coster-Waldau is game enough as the most (only) hated figure onscreen. Rapper-songstress Nicki Minaj makes her live-action thesping debut as Carlys saucy assistant while Don Johnson has a few choice scenes as Carlys father. Several stray references to Chinese culture including a particularly random teary-eyed defense of feng shui from Kate feel sufficiently jarring as to suggest a half-hearted attempt to woo the all-important Asian market.

RALPH says April 29 2014 at 815 pm Im sure people are just itching to see the bare feet of Cameron Diaz. Reply Mike says April 25 2014 at 900 am Um.. . . Its Diaz the cool brittle one who is the yang and Manns emotional one is the yin. Reply Josalyn says April 24 2014 at 1048 am Can anyone buy Cameron Diaz as a high-powered attorney ? I cant . This lady is filthy rich  and she can afford to be more discerning with scripts  roles  and directors . Reply Stella says April 23 2014 at 729 pm I wonder how this film would be received if the genders were reversed and men were doing these heinous things to a woman. Reply Alex says May 8 2014 at 104 am Oh my God...sexist slurs in a comedy film Surely not Reply therealeverton says April 23 2014 at 942 am This again..""superhero filled..."" Even if we count the very springtime release of Captain America how is having a few superhero films out of the what 100 or more? films released this summer filled? The step up from the days when youd get one or two every few years does not equate to there being almost nothing else as too many writers are want to pretend. Also the idea that females dont attend those films in large numbers or are somehow forced to is beyond antiquated. (No film fails to have a few people there because their partner / friends wanted to go but millions of girls and women arent going to see these films all under duress. In fact I know more female ""Marvel Studios"" fans than male ones. Reply Jane says April 23 2014 at 957 pm The movie premiered today in UK Ive watched the last screening at 9pm and the cinema was full - girlfriends and couples and guy friends. Audience was laughing out loud. In all fairness the film has better dialogues than most chick flicks Leslie Manns role demanded more comedic sensibility and shes delivered it quite well. Although I love Diaz she was somewhat uncomfortable in scenes with Kate Upton (clearly very young and a radiant beauty) and a bit forced chemistry with Taylor Kinney. I understand the directors choice for Kate and Taylor but the script should have given them funnier lines and give them the opportunity to define their personalities. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is in his element although the final bloody scene was way too forced. Overall a good movie about female bonding - it get kudos for eliminating the neurosis and psychosis and focus on unexpected friendships. Its a comedy and we laughed - thats what matters Reply LOL says April 23 2014 at 1257 pm Superhero movies are crap. The Other Woman looks crap too. Reply cadavra says April 23 2014 at 739 am If youre going to compare this to other movies Google ""Three in the Attic.""

Kate (Leslie Mann) discovers husband (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is playing away when Carly (Cameron Diaz) turns up at the door wearing little more than hotpants and a come-hither smile. And so an odd-couple friendship is born hysterical kooky wife Kate and level-headed lawyer Carly. At first their antics are kind of amusing. That changes when they discover a second mistress enter model Kate Upton struggling to keep up with Diaz and Mann. The plot lurches between madcap dashes to foreign climes and cliched revenge montages (hair thinner in the shampoo laxatives in the scotch etc). Small roles for Don Johnson and Nicki Minaj feel pointless and while Coster-Waldau is great at being the smooth guy he could use a dose of idiocy in the comeuppance scenes. Theres a strong whiff of The First Wives Club and an even a sprinkling of Working Girl here - but instead of updating the genre The Other Woman rehashes it bringing little more than a few giggles and a dash of glamour to the table.
