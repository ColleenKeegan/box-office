You could hardly make a John Woo sci-fi thriller for that. Well you just might if you concentrated the action in one Bond-like mega-set and rationed the contra-flow car chases fireballs and terminus getaways. In his adaptation of Philip K Dicks 1953 short story about a machine that can read the future Woo choreographs all the aforementioned with his customary muscular elan but theres a sense of treading water about this movie. Further the self-referential tropes - the face-off gun duels slo-mo bullet trajectories and the like - seem less like cinematic in-jokes than nervous insurance policies delivered with an absence of humour. Yet for all the inevitable inconsistencies and implausibilities of the script this aint all bad. The design is good; Affleck is at his least smug and nauseating. And Thurman as the kick-boxing biologist lover who helps fend off both corporate assassins and FBI wields the meanest handbag since Jack Lemmon.

(AP Photo/ PARAMOUNT/DREAMWORKS / Doug Curran) Photo DOUG CURRAN The moneys great but the memorys not / Greed is costly for genius in sci-fi thriller 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Paycheck Thriller. Starring Ben Affleck Uma Thurman and Aaron Eckhart. Directed by John Woo. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Paycheck"" is a blast of summer in the heart of the holiday movie season. Running mainly on adrenaline and a gimmick its different from other holiday movies in that its not ambitious earnest or overblown and it obviously wasnt made with one eye on the Oscars . Based on a story by sci-fi master Philip K. Dick and directed by John Woo its a futuristic thriller that aspires to be nothing but entertaining and for the most part it satisfies. It stars Ben Affleck in the first movie since ""The Sum of All Fears"" in which he doesnt seem like a big stiff. He plays a computer genius -- now stop laughing thats not nice -- who works for various competing software companies. At the completion of each job he gets a fat paycheck and he also gets his memory erased to prevent him from selling his discoveries elsewhere. Because he works a lot all he remembers of his life are vacations. Like other films inspired by Philip K. Dicks stories (including ""Minority Report"" and ""Blade Runner"") ""Paycheck"" has a central premise that combines gut-level fascination with moral and existential implications. By repeatedly agreeing to have his memory wiped Jennings (Affleck) is giving away months of his life at a time. Isnt that what most people do in their careers -- sell chunks of their time during which they perform tasks that are not intrinsically pleasurable or broadening? Perhaps. Yet to the extent that human beings are the sum of their memories and experiences theres an aching sense that what Jennings is doing is spiritually bereft. Ultimate temptation arrives in the form of the job to end all jobs. Aaron Eckhart plays a billionaire mogul who offers Jennings a huge salary in exchange for three years of work. For three years he has to live inside a compound and labor on a single project. At the end of that time hell remember nothing but hell be a multimillionaire. Since Jennings at this point is basically a blithe sort of fellow whose sense of life is entirely mechanistic he decides to do it. Three years later the world looks very much the same but Jennings has earned himself 92 million -- except that when he goes to the bank to collect he finds out that he has forfeited his entire fee. All he has to show for his time is a manila envelope filled with seemingly random objects -- a key a ring an aerosol can sunglasses etc. To make matters worse everywhere he turns someone is trying to kill him. Its a bad day. Affleck might not be a convincing software genius but we hardly ever see Jennings at work so it doesnt matter. The important quality Affleck brings to ""Paycheck"" is his genial essence which makes him a valuable locus for Woos ever-moving camera. Afflecks stumbling uncomplicated decency would make it possible for anyone watching any part of the movie even in silence to identify him as the good guy. Hes the movies anchor. Most of ""Paycheck"" consists of Jennings trying to sort through his predicament and survive. Hes aided by Uma Thurman as Rachel a woman with whom he had a three-year relationship that he doesnt remember. Thurman brings a dynamic physicality to the action sequences and the always-reliable Paul Giamatti appears as Shorty the one friend Jennings can still trust. Yet despite the energy of Woos directorial attack the story itself loses propulsion in the second half. Without ever quite becoming boring ""Paycheck"" seems to narrow into a routine pattern and a plot that at first had nuance and the hint of a broader meaning degenerates into chases and standard action. This isnt terrible -- and in fact arriving amid a slew of high-minded films its almost refreshing. But its not quite as refreshing as one might have hoped and in the end when all is revealed ""Paycheck"" doesnt really add up. -- Advisory This film contains strong action violence and sexual situations.

Ben Afflecks character exchanges his memory for a big payday in Paycheck. Too bad this contraption cant erase the memory of Gigli. By Doug Curran Paramount Pictures Ben Affleck must have signed on to this bloated action film to collect a fat check. That would make more sense than if he claimed to be mesmerized by this ridiculous story. Afflecks character a mild-mannered but brilliant engineer who creates top-secret projects for high-tech companies gets an offer he cant resist an eight-figure paycheck for a single job that will take three years. Oh and hell have no memory of any of those years. When he emerges from his assignment things are not as predicted He has forfeited his earnings and is being hunted by the government. He must learn why. Though the premise is provocative enough the execution feels like a host of other violent action-drenched movies. Perhaps another director given the same material might have focused on the mind-bending story and the paranoia of the characters involved. John Woo is too busy with his elaborately choreographed action sequences and dramatic stunts to delve too deeply into the landscape of the psyche. Afflecks engineer spends his time evading fighting and slaying FBI operatives and criminals. And on the topic of disappointments why would Uma Thurman bother with this overblown explosion-fest after her more interesting turn in Kill Bill Vol. 1? She does assist in saving the world in Paycheck so perhaps she took this part to atone for her vengeful killing spree in the Quentin Tarantino film. There is some comic relief from a schlubby scientist played by Paul Giamatti. The scenes between Affleck and him are among the films better moments because Thurman and Afflecks chemistry isnt exactly red-hot. Maybe Affleck was drawn to this movie because it involves the loss of memory. Who wouldnt want to forget Gigli and now this? (Opens Thursday nationally. PG-13 for action violence and brief language.)

Hall Kathryn Morris; Director John Woo; Author Dean Georgaris; Release Date Wide 12/25/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 110; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted December 22 2003 -- 1200 AM EST Were back in Philip K. Dick pulp-sci-fi territory in Paycheck questioning definitions of reality selfhood and human autonomy in a futuristic machine-assisted age of mind messing. (""Blade Runner"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Minority Report"" hail from the same frontier.) Were also back in John Woo territory or at least in the Hong Kong directors steely impersonal semblance of his own famous style in which moments of existential import are marked with a flapping of dove wings a crossing of weapons and a choreography of action tied to an appreciation of moral crisis. Mostly though were in a confounding deep-winter movie twilight in which every image instantly vanishes from our memory. The story tells of a sharky tech genius Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) who regularly hires himself out to steal the inventions of competing companies then glibly submits his brain to a neo-Frankensteinian neural scouring that erases all consciousness of the dirty work he has done. (Paul Giamatti plays a backroom scrubber with more soul and scruples than the rest of his colleagues made manifest in his little loser beard and squashy Woody Allen hat.) A yuppie of the dotcom-boom variety Michael is in it for the bucks - the title refers to the only aspect of the deal that interests him signified early on anachronistically with the passing of a paper check so early 20th century to the freelancer. And when an equally lizardy pal Jimmy Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) offers a jumbo payoff for a particularly dangerous change-the-world project Michael coolly signs on. Except that when he signs out three years later he finds he has forfeited his eight-figure payment for an envelope filled with doodads - a paper clip a matchbook a crossword puzzle etc. - assembled to point him in the direction of a tomorrow he cant remember seeing but which clearly he must stop before he himself is terminated. Also by the by Michael has acquired a girlfriend Rachel (Uma Thurman) a company biologist (growing hydroponic magic beans for all we can tell) who loves her hunkalunka guy more than even the coolest Titanium G4 laptop a design-conscious futurist can covet. And thats a lot. Were ""Paycheck""s blankness presented more convincingly as a brilliant scheme to echo Dicks story (adapted by screenwriter Dean Georgaris) the movie would qualify as a marvel - the first of its kind to scientifically erase audience memory in aid of repeat ticket sales. But nothing in the sleek affectless unspooling suggests such genius. Instead the directors well-tuned assembly-line approach reflects the limitations the project held for him - Woo took the job in place of Brett Ratner - as well as the restrictions imposed by the alloy-metal composition of the cast. The icy fire that Thurman uncovered within herself in ""Kill Bill"" is sealed over by the triteness of her job as a kind of ethics Tinker Bell keeping her dazed man on the heroic path of good conscience. And as for Affleck and Eckhart rarely have two cleft chins faced off with such thrust - or absence of consequence. The actors instincts to take the roles were good ones since both come most alive playing men whose handsomeness covers reserves of nastiness. But with no punch left in this repetition of the sci-fi mantra that puny human memory is what makes us human those jaws read like nothing more than cartoon Woo weapons themselves.

Uninspired turns from Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman suggest something less than full belief in this quickly forgettable thriller. Even those filmgoers with a constant need for speed arent likely to boost pic to more than average B.O. Ultra-slo-mo fight scenes characters with emotional baggage and standoffs featuring heavy artillery have always been chief among the reasons audiences have gone to see John Woo films. But ""Paycheck"" the second offering from Paramount in a month to struggle with themes of time travel again cleans the studios clock. Uninspired star turns from Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman suggest something less than full belief in this quickly forgettable thriller. Even those filmgoers with a constant need for speed arent likely to boost pic to more than average B.O. Fans of Philip K. Dick also will be disappointed by ""Paycheck"" which ranks with ""Impostor"" as among the least memorable of big-screen adaptations of the late S.F. authors canon. Its the big ideas in Dicks stories that frequently seduce Hollywood filmmakers but that can also prove their undoing if those filmmakers arent careful. The premise of a specialist hired to tinker with a competitors potentially profitable gadgets in order to find out how they work and who then routinely must have his memory of the job erased has potential to address themes involving identity and life purpose. But this latest dip into the Dick oeuvre plays more like a TV episode. Pic hints that its embrace of all things technological has a lighter side when specialist Jennings (Affleck) after fiddling with a 3-D computer tells friend and brain specialist Shorty (Paul Giamatti) who supervises the memory erasure procedure that forgetting his workaday hours allows him to savor the highlights of his life. Jennings brushes off Shortys concerns about a new offer from tech firm Allcom and cocky owner Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) to work on a super-secret device for three years -- Jennings stints usually last two months -- for an eight-figure paycheck. Cavalier about the deal even when Rethricks No. 2 man Wolfe (Colm Feore) plunges a huge needle gun into his arm as part of the memory regimen Jennings flirts a bit with Allcoms cute inhouse biologist Rachel (Thurman) whom he first met at one of Rethricks parties. Moments pass and its three years later with Jennings memory seemingly restored and his services no longer needed. Expecting his bank account to contain his 90 million fee Jennings is shocked to learn he had signed a paper a month before waiving remuneration. All he has to show for his work is a legal envelope containing 19 items ranging from a single bullet and a few ball bearings to a transit ticket. The items start coming to good use as hes captured by and then flees from the FBI which presents him with incriminating evidence. ""Paycheck"" grows more preposterous by the reel as it sends Jennings down the rabbit hole where he must pick up the pieces and put clues together -- and team up with Rachel. But it also offers action-meister Woo a chance to juice up the proceedings. Sadly the chain of chase and shootout sequences here are so familiar that even Woos signature style becomes routine. It doesnt help that the notion of Jennings being able to follow the breadcrumb trail hes intentionally laid for himself in case something did go wrong strains credulity. Also jarring is this techie engineers surprising ability with guns chopsocky and motorcycles. Stretching matters even further is the idea that a greedy company would see into a future that points to nuclear war and then encourages that war to happen -- thus nuking itself and its thriving stockholders. In his second action role of the year (""Daredevil"" being the first) Affleck appears distinctly out of sync with this kind of movie role neither convincing as a techno genius nor as a stud on the run. For her part Thurman isnt near matching the ferocity she generated in ""Kill Bill"" and even her usual sense of irony is about as erased as Jennings memory bank. Eckhart is wasted as a smirking bad guy. Giamatti is the only actor in the cast who seems to be enjoying himself. An impressively long roster of visual effects firms produce pics myriad computer-based and pyrotechnic trickery and while most of the work displays a high standard there are no bits of the truly original kind of razzle-dazzle that has graced other major Dick adaptations from ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall"" to ""Minority Report."" Woos usual production crew gives him that high-budget look but its the old Woo of long-gone lower-budget H.K. days that is sadly missed.
