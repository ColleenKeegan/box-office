Hes fashionably blemished. Aiming to do for shut-in monsters what Twilight has for bloodsuckers this teenage NYC riff on Beauty and the Beast casts Pettyfer as a pretty boy who incurs the wrath of a scorned classmate (Mary-Kate Olsen). Cursed with disfigurement hes got a year to convince someone to see past the mask to the heartthrob underneath. Otherwise the acne is there to stay.Beastly is a special brand of hogwash a fairy tale that preaches inner beauty while refusing to obscure the looks of its doomed hero. Once hes had a sulk Pettyfer sets his sights on Vanessa Hudgens a hottie so pure she can see the depths of his alter ego. Ive seen worse says Hudgens catching a glimpse of that face. Its hard to say the same about Beastly.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its almost impressive how far Beastly bends over backward to bring the ""Beauty And The Beast"" story into the modern world. While forcibly incorporating cell phones social media texting and Google into the action it still keeps the beats of the original fairy tale even up to the caring father whose poor decisions condemn his daughter to life in a monsters castle. But while the film has a few ideas in its miserly playbook it commits to none of them for more than a ham-fisted line of dialogue or two. In every aspect from story to tone to characterization to visual aesthetic its laughably perfunctory as though everyone involved were too embarrassed to give it more than a half-ironic token effort. I Am Number Fours Alex Pettyfer stars as the smug rich kid whose inner ugliness magically becomes outer ugliness In an early warning sign of just how apathetically shallow Beastly plans to be he starts off the film baldly informing an enthusiastically cheering crowd of voters at his prep school that he has no interest in the environment but still deserves to be president of the Green Committee (whatever that is) since hes attractive and the credit will look good on his resume. Once he wins hes equally cartoonish about insulting his glam-goth witch classmate Mary-Kate Olsen so she curses him with glistening scars and bad-ass tattoos and tells him theyll become permanent if he cant get someone--for instance soft-hearted doe-eyed High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens--to profess love for him within a year. The story progression from there is obvious but writer-director Daniel Barnz (working from Alex Flinns YA novel) makes the mistake of treating it as though its obvious and as though none of its characters or scenes are worth the slightest exploration. Instead the film whisks across plot points and drags across time-wasting business like Neil Patrick Harris role as a blind tutor who serves no story function whatsoever. Harris imbues his scenes with a little wry self-aware comedy but seems to be in an entirely different (and no better) film. Meanwhile Lisa Gay Hamilton (as a saintly magical-Negro maid) acts as if this is an indie drama while Hudgens plays her role for tender romance Olsen embraces the camp and Pettyfer delivers his lines with a thuddingly strained casualness that suggests he doesnt believe a word hes saying. The whole film is choppy rushed and confused except in the one muddled action scene where it becomes downright incompetent. Say what you will about Twilight--whose look and supernatural-romance tone Beastly occasionally tries to copy--but at least its endless angsty wallowing finds an emotion and dives in deep. Beastly has no idea what human emotion even looks like.

BOTTOM LINE A sometimes clever sometimes clumsy update of a classic fairy tale. CAST Alex Pettyfer Vanessa Hudgens Neil Patrick Harris Mary-Kate Olsen LENGTH 126 An updated version of a fairy tale about the shallowness of beauty ""Beastly"" focuses on some of natures nastiest and most brutish creatures teenagers. Who better to illustrate the ugly twin obsessions of appearance and acceptance? ""Beastly"" begins in the fictional Buckston Academy in Manhattan where popular senior Kyle Kingston (Alex Pettyfer ""I Am Number Four"") sits atop the social pyramid. His notable qualities a chiseled face family money and a capacity for cruelty. Only the schools resident goth Kendra (an amusing Mary-Kate Olsen) sees through him which so rankles Kyle that he humiliates her in public. Bad move Kendra turns out to be a witch and her cryptically slangy incantation - ""Embrace the suck"" - makes mincemeat of Kyles face and body. Kyle must now find someone who will love him or stay disfigured forever. advertisement | advertise on newsday He picks Lindy an intelligent self-possessed classmate played by an appealing Vanessa Hudgens. Through a clumsy plot twist Lindy must live with Kyle in his ritzy hideout but parents neednt worry Their chaperones are a blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris) and a kindly maid (Stony Brooks Lisa Gay Hamilton). Directed and written (from Alex Flinns novel) by Daniel Barnz ""Beastly"" rather ironically suffers from Kyles distracting looks. His face is so elaborately gashed tattooed and even soldered that the makeup artists seem to lose their place from scene to scene. Its also hard to take seriously a guy whose left eyebrow says ""suck."" Beneath it all however is a movie with a good heart.

Spectacularly poor judgment in everything from acting to costuming (Olsens Harajuku-troll get-up is scarier than her curse) puts Beastly right on the cusp of the so-bad-its-good Hall of Shame. So heres a litmus test If youre tickled by the prospect of hearing our heroine squeal at her beast ""You come near me I taser your a-"" then fill up your tomato bag and buy a ticket. Otherwise consider the movies title a rare case of truth in advertising.

"Beastly review This story of a beauty and a beast is no fairy tale |       NJ.com comments Beastly review This story of a beauty and a beast is no fairy tale Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 04 2011 at 1159 AM updated March 04 2011 at 1201 PM View/Post Comments CBS Films Alex Pettyfer (as ""Hunter"") and Vanessa Hudgens (as ""Lindy"") star in ""Beastly."" Rich brat Kyle is handsome on the outside ugly on the inside -- until one day he makes the mistake of publicly humiliating a high-school Goth girl whose interest in witchcraft isnt a pose. And suddenly things are literally reversed -- and every ugly thing Kyle ever said every wounding look he ever gave now show up as literal scars across his disfigured face. And will stay there until he can get someone to love him as he is. There is a bit of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" here as well as a healthy dose of ""Beauty and the Beast"" of course. What isnt here is magic. Based on a young-adult novel the movie casts the pretty shallow Alex Pettyfer -- last seen pouting his way through ""I Am Number Four"" -- as Kyle. Teensy Vanessa Hudgens apparently still stuck in high school plays the nice girl he only really sees once hes monstrous. Movie Review Beastly (PG-13) CBS Films (86 min.) Directed by Daniel Barnz. With Alex Pettyfer Vanessa Hudgens. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains mild violence and drug references. Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS And the whole thing is pretty dreary. The dialogue veers between badly overwritten dialogue that sounds as if the filmmaker just saw ""Juno"" for the eighteenth time and sadly out-of-it lines that sound as if he hasnt seen a movie since ""Valley Girl."" (""Rad""? Really? Unironically?) And although everything is supposedly taking place in Manhattan the settings (mostly Montreal along with a few badly dressed sets) place us squarely in the middle of Nowheresville where tony prep schools are in huge glass buildings at the bottom of tiny dead-end streets and Brooklyn neighborhoods are misspelled. These would be minor problems if the characters held our belief or at least our interest. But they dont. The uglified Pettyfer mopes around like a glum Freddy Krueger. Hudgens mostly crinkles up her nose as if shes trying very very hard to think. Obviously its not working. Or maybe shed wonder what happened to that handsome guy who used to tell all the ugly kids to just ""embrace the suck."" And maybe notice finally that the gruesome guy shes currently hanging with has ""Embrace"" tattooed above one eye and ""Suck"" above the other. Mary-Kate Olsen makes a brief appearance as a sexy young woman with unearthly powers not least of which was probably finally shedding herself of Ashley. And Neil Patrick Harris is predictably delightful as Kyles live-in blind foppish tutor. But for a fable about a magical curse ""Beastly"" is strangely earthbound. And once it starts it just seems to go on sappily ever after.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 04 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Beastly a modern high-school version of the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast is no match for Disneys animated feature film of 1991 or of the ethereal Jean Cocteau classic from 1946 but it earns better than a passing grade. There are moments of salty wit to its teen TV sensibility and the story offers proof once again than there are few stories that cant be adapted to the theme of teenaged popularity politics. Movies Beastly The official trailer Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) is the blond buff rich handsome supertwit who rules Manhattans elite Buckston Academy an institution distinctly reminiscent of Gossip Girl. While running for head of the academys environmental committee Kyle has an unusual message to the student body ""Embrace the suck."" Kyles campaign style is based on ruthless honesty. He explains that his interest in running for office is strictly to add the item on to his college applications which is reasonable since life is all about winning. Existence is Darwinian Hobbesian Fox Newsian or in other words profoundly unfair. The less fortunate - a.k.a. the ""hatchet faces"" and ""fatty cakes"" - should adjust themselves accordingly. For students raised in the privileged class and pleased by this honesty they acclaim him as the new chairman. Beastly based on the novel by Alex Flinn begins with a refreshing rudeness especially for a movie that features one of the stars of High School Musical Vanessa Hudgens as the perky scholarship student Lindy and half of the Olsens Mary-Kate as Kendra the Goth punk outsider with the black eye gunk and a poufy French aristocrat hairdo who happens to be a witch. When Kyle plays a mean trick on Kendra and calls her a ""Frankenskank"" she retaliates with a magic spell. Soon the suck embraces him Kyle gets a bad case of dermatitis including glowing veinous tattoos on his now-bald noggin sebaceous lumps around his nose and lacerations across his face. It would be a great look for the front man of a glam-death-metal band. Instead Kyle ignores the expensive guitars in his room and gives us emo attitude without the music. Kyles emotionally absent anchorman dad (Peter Krause) who believes ""people like people who look good"" shudders at his sons transformation and considers a life-threatening operation to be worth the risk. Finally he gives up and ships Kyle off to a suite of apartments in Brooklyn (oh no). In lieu of parenting Kyle is given a homily-spouting Jamaican maid (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and a wisecracking blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris) who says lines like ""Study or soon blonds will be making jokes about you."" Up to this point things are ticking along agreeably - the only question is why the movie isnt just called Bitchy. Then unfortunately the drama starts becoming sensitive and instructive. Theres the traditional out clause to Kyles curse All that he needs is to find someone to love him despite his repellent rock-star appearance. The leading candidate is the chipmunk-cheeked Hudgens who ends up hiding out from bad guys in Kyles apartment little knowing that the buff dude who looks and sounds like a bald tattooed Kyle is actually Kyle Beastly gets too soppy in the home stretch with several scenes in a rooftop greenhouse flower garden accompanied by poetry reading or lisping ballads on the soundtrack. Yet in retelling a story that Disney called a ""tale as old as time"" Beastly gets one timeless fact right For hatchet faces fatty cakes and Frankenskanks high school can definitely feel like a curse.

Installed in a Brooklyn penthouse with a wisecracking blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris) and a wise Jamaican maid (Lisa Gay Hamilton) by his even shallower embarrassed anchorman dad (Peter Krause) this motorcycle-riding beast must find a woman to love him within a year to break the spell. A former classmate (Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"") he previously disdained as insufficiently hot is forced to move in with him when her addict father accidentally kills somebody. Though Pettyfer delivers precisely the same wooden performance before and after the change she somehow doesnt recognize this suddenly gentle soul who woos her with poetry and his newly acquired gardening skills. ""Beastly"" more than lives up to its name with ultra-campy performances high-glucose direction (Daniel Barnz) laughable dialogue cheesy effects and a back-lot simulation of a Manhattan street that wouldnt pass muster on an after-school special.

In this film publicity image released by CBS Films Alex Pettyfer background and Vanessa Hudgens is shown in a scene from ""Beastly."" Photo Takashi Seida AP Beastly review Can she unlock his inner beauty? 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Beastly Romantic youth fantasy. Starring Vanessa Hudgens Alex Pettyfer and Mary-Kate Olsen. Directed by Daniel Barnz. (PG-13. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A sweet film - a modern riff on ""Beauty and the Beast"" - ""Beastly"" is a youth romance directed by Daniel Barnz who showed imagination and sensitivity in his feature ""Phoebe in Wonderland"" and hasnt lost those qualities now that hes entered the world of the big budgets. An exploration of beauty inner and outer it gives us the modern-day fable of a handsome and horribly arrogant high school kid whose face overnight becomes as ugly as he is inside. We meet him in his handsome incarnation campaigning for student government with a speech that asks ""Are you going to vote for me because Im a rich good-looking guy with a famous news anchor dad? And the answer is Hell yeah. "" Oh yes the script is a little ham-fisted plowing through exposition and establishing character with a steam shovel but in a tale like this sometimes being obvious and cutting to the chase can be a virtue. Yes Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) is a real jerk - mean and cynical a social bully with the makings of a truly monstrous man. And then one day he makes the mistake of insulting the school witch who is played by Mary-Kate Olsen (that in itself should have given him pause). As the witch Olsen slouches pouts rolls her eyes and is the essence of self-absorbed self-satisfied self-confidence. She turns Kyle beastly in a spell that can only be reversed by a womans telling him ""I love you"" within the year. In other words he has to become lovable by developing inner qualities because its clear hes going no place with that face. Related Stories Beastly Actually Kyle could have been a lot uglier (like Aaron Eckhart in ""The Dark Knight"" ugly) but the movie spared us. As it stands about the worst that can be said for him is that he has weird tattoos and scars all over his head and what appear to be fresh lacerations on his face. Hes also bald though thats not a problem since women dig that. Vanessa Hudgens plays the heroine of the tale Lindy Kyles last best hope of an ""I love you"" some time this century. Hudgens has a pure and idiosyncratic look that makes us believe in Lindys unique spirit. Hudgens looks like an average pretty young woman and then the camera closes in on her face and you almost forget the movie because shes so ... not beautiful so much as ... alive. Vivid. Thats a face made for movies. Alas even at 86 minutes ""Beastly"" starts to feel stretched inside an hour. To head off a quick resolution Barnz who also wrote the screenplay relies on the two most familiar and least forgivable devices familiar from bad romantic comedies (1) The movie gets to the point that it can end if only someone tells someone something but the person chooses not to for no discernible reason; and (2) Theres a concocted misunderstanding that could also be resolved with a brief conversation but that conversation is delayed. That the presence of these devices seems less intrusive here than elsewhere probably has to do with the movies supernatural trappings the charm of the actors and the urgency of the situation. Still the script really does cave in toward the finish. Still I liked this movie maybe more than I should have and would be happy to see anything this director wants to do next.

Only the sardonic reactions of Neil Patrick Harriss blind tutor (particularly his gleeful promotion of the greeting ""Wassup"") temporarily deflates the suffocating schmaltz of Daniel Barnzs teen romance in which cocky looks-are-everything Ken-doll Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) is stricken with a bald scarred and tattooed exterior by a goth-fashionista witch (Mary-Kate Olsen). To reverse the curse Kyle must find true love with alterna-cutie-pie Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens). The means by which Lindy eventually finds herself in Kyles custody--a mishmash of tossed-off plot contrivances involving the duos disappointing daddies--is pitifully contrived albeit no clumsier than Barnzs smeary-vision evocation of Kyles monstrous mutation or the soundtracks incessant on-the-nose ballads. Chemistry between the dully brooding Pettyfer and blandly adorable Hudgens is nonexistent a void highlighted by a cringe-worthy meet-cute involving the couple fabricating translations for a Korean soap opera--a scene that doubles as an apt metaphor for this tin-eared corny attempt at fairy-tale interpretation.

Comments click to enlarge Beastly Video Rated PG-13  95 minutes  2011 Loosely adapted from Alex Flinns young-adult novel this Beauty and the Beast update is a pallid formulaic teen romance that might have benefited from a little snark. Alex Pettyfer (I Am Number Four) hangs a dead weight around the movie as a privileged golden boy who insults everyone in sight; Mary-Kate Olsen dressed in runway goth plays the high school witch who turns him into a beast (bald tattooed and pierced with rad silver ornaments in his nose and forehead).

"Beastly | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; beastly ) Beastly (United States 2011) March 03 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Beastly is Beauty and the Beast for the Twilight generation. Featuring a cast top-heavy with TV actors and a screenplay that could have been given an assist by Stephanie Meyer the end result would have ended up on the ABC Family Channel if it had been made by Disney. CBS Films apparently has higher aspirations for this dreadfully mediocre production although the postponement of its release date (from its originally announced July 2010 to March 2011) may indicate diminished expectations. Beauty and the Beast is a fairy tale and when treated as a fantasy it works as such. Beastly opts not only to modernize the story but to transplant it into the ""real world."" The result is a contrived mess. Characters act in bizarre ways for no reason other than thats whats required by the story which follows the Disney version more closely than the original story (or the classic Cocteau interpretation). There are even stand-ins for Lumiere and Mrs. Potts although sadly Cogsworth got the ax. Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) is the most popular boy in his elite private high school with an ego to match his incredible good looks. Hes cruel callous and self-absorbed in the extreme. Girls are ornaments to him designed exclusively to enhance his attractiveness. Theres an exception however the bookish Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) who inexplicably gets under his skin. However before anything can develop between them he makes the mistake of paying an insult to Kendra the Witch (Mary-Kate Olsen). Her response take away Kyles good looks. The curse is reversible but theres a deadline he has one year in which to provoke a confession of true love from a girl or hes doomed to remain as-is for the rest of his life. His father provides him with a house where he can hide-out from the world with his only companions being a housekeeper (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and a blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris). Eventually through circumstances too tiresome to describe Lindy comes to live with Kyle (not knowing who he is because he looks so different) and he begins the process of getting her to fall in love with him. I will admit that with his long flowing locks and classically rugged appearance Alex Pettyfer is a good-looking guy. He cant act (his ""performance"" in I Am Number Four backs up this statement) but he is handsome. The process of making him ""ugly"" stops considerably short of the supposed goal. The end product is a skinhead with some bizarre tattoos and a bad case of acne. Very emo. I guess afflicting him with elephantitis might have upset the swooning girls in the audience although it would have made for a more compelling story. Lindy is apparently blind since she cant recognize that Kyle with the bald pate is Kyle with the good hair. Must be the Clark Kent/Superman effect with the hair standing in for the glasses. Like Pettyfer Vanessa Hudgens is blessed with amazing looks to go along with her limited acting. She has two modes moody and hyper-cheerful. Both are annoying at least in this film. One might expect Neil Patrick Harris to liven things up but he is kept in check by writer/director Daniel Barnz. And as with Lisa Gay Hamilton and Mary-Kate Olsen he is kept firmly in the ""supporting"" category. Beastly focuses on Pettyfer and Hudgens which is not a good combination. Its a good thing these two dont generate any sparks because with all the wood in evidence the conflagration might exceed what one could expect from a bomb. Beastly was made with tween girls in mind. Its the kind of love story a viewer can believe in when she is indiscriminating enough to ignore bad acting bad writing and mediocre filmmaking. For those who happen to be in the target category Beastly will likely be welcomed as enjoyable fluff. For those who are not however its 90 minutes better spent doing something else - anything else. Sad to say the Disney cartoon featured characters who were more three-dimensional and dialogue that was smarter than wittier than anything to be found in this uninspired live-action re-imagining of the classic tale.

Instead of handsome popular and arrogant high school star Kyle becoming the hairy Disney-like beast that author Alex Flinn describes director and screenwriter Daniel Barnz has him lose his pretty blonde locks and present a bald scarred tattooed and deeply ravaged facade to the world.If only all the departures from the book worked that well.The film is at its strongest as it sets the stage for the enchantment to come. Kyle is a bully treating everyone on the basis of looks with himself at the top of the high school pecking order.Hes particularly cruel to witchy-looking Kendra (Mary-Kate Olsen giving off wise old spirit vibes in her first memorable big-screen role). Unfortunately for Kyle it turns out that Kendra is a real witch. When Kyle stands her up at a dance for the purpose of humiliating her she casts a spell that transforms him until he learns to love and win the love of another in the space of a year.Pettyfer gives a moving portrayal of anger and withdrawal as the looks and popularity on which he built his self-esteem are swept away like a sand castle by an angry unforgiving tide.The tale loses its way in the middle despite a witty performance by Neil Patrick Harris as a blind tutor in the brownstone where Kyles father hides him. Part of the books strength was in the way it showed how reading alters Kyle on the inside readying him for the love that will grow when Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) a poor scholarship student at his old school ends up in his place needing protection.Here Harris is reduced to a quasi-relationship coach. Pretty Hudgens with her pop High School Musical looks is too easy to like which makes it not much of a stretch for Kyle to fall for her. Plus she seems to accept Kyles new looks from the start which minimizes her journey.The biggest miss comes when Lindy responds to Kyles declaration of love by deciding at the last minute not to take a school trip to Machu Picchu that shed saved up for all year. Huh? Maybe the Big Moment from the book where he risks death to save her is a cliche but some cliches are emotionally satisfying. Machu Picchu? Not so much.BeastlyB- Starring Alex Pettyfer Vanessa Hudgens Neil Patrick Harris Peter Krause and Mary-Kate Olsen. Directed by Daniel Barnz.

"Beastly is an ugly retelling of fairy tale - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Beastly is an ugly retelling of fairy tale By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Spoiled teenager Kyle Kingstons beastly mantra is ""Beautiful people get it better."" By Takashi Seida CBS Films Under her spell Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) must get Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) to fall in love him so he can get his good looks back. EnlargeClose By Takashi Seida CBS Films Under her spell Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) must get Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) to fall in love him so he can get his good looks back. So of course he needs to be shown a lesson. This modern reworking of Beauty and the Beast has none of the charm of the Disney animated version. Its dogged by awkward dialogue a ridiculous plot and lackluster performances especially by the leads Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens. Kyle (Pettyfer) is a cocky handsome 17-year-old running for school office with the meaningless slogan ""Embrace the suck."" He mocks just about everyone less gorgeous and popular than he is which is just about everyone. Lindy (Hudgens) is his classmate an earnest scholarship student also running for office. When Kyle turns his snide comments on witchy Goth-style Kendra (Mary-Kate Olsen) she transforms him into a ""beast""-- actually just a pierced shaved-headed dude with a few scars. The key to Kendras spell harking back to the original fairy tale is that Kyle must find someone to truly love him to get his good looks back. Lindy is the one he chooses. In the book by Alex Flinn Kendra is supposed to be frumpy and chubby. And for that role the filmmakers cast an Olsen twin? Also in Flinns novel Kyle is supposed to be transformed into a fanged and hairy creature with sharp claws not a tattooed love boy. But presumably this version is easier on our eyes -- which kind of defeats the entire point. As smoothly obnoxious Kyle Pettyfer (currently also in I Am Number Four) is passable. But when he has to show a more vulnerable side -- under the mask of the beast -- his limited acting skills loom large. Hudgens doesnt expand much beyond her High School Musical persona. About the movie Beastly 1/2 (out of four)Stars Alex Pettyfer Vanessa Hudgens Neil Patrick Harris Mary-Kate Olsen Peter KrauseDirector Daniel BarnzDistributor CBS FilmsRating PG-13 for language including crude comments brief violence and some thematic materialRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Friday nationwide For all her supposed smarts Lindy doesnt quite notice that the beastly guy she has taken a shine to (in a truly convoluted plot device) has the words ""Embrace"" and ""Suck"" tattooed on his eyebrows. Wouldnt that give something away? The movies saving grace is Neil Patrick Harris as Will Kyles wisecracking blind tutor who appears at Kyles house one day to school the self-centered guy on being decent with a capital D. Clearly the filmmakers didnt quite get the books intent by casting some of the best-looking young stars in Hollywood for a story whose message is character and kindness over beauty. Then again their concerns probably were on reeling in the target Twilight demographic. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"Movie review Beastly - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review BeastlyDaniel Barnz directs this modern twist on the Beauty and the Beast tale starring Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens along with Mary-Kate Olsen Neil Patrick Harris and Peter Krause.March 04 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Alex Pettyfer plays the Beast and Vanessa Hudgens is Lindy in the movie ""Beastly."" (Takashi Seida CBS Films )Certainly better than the word ""passable"" might imply ""Beastly"" is a sly and pleasant-enough young-adult programmer that is more likeable than not. Adapted and directed by Daniel Barnz who previously made the Sundance title ""Phoebe in Wonderland"" the film centers on a brash arrogant high school pretty boy (Alex Pettyfer) whose internal ugliness becomes externalized when he runs afoul of a spell-casting girl dabbling in witchcraft. She gives him one year to find someone to love him or he will remain in this altered state forever. His best shot turns out to be a shy loner (Vanessa Hudgens) to whom he had previously paid little attention. Based on the novel by Alex Flinn ""Beastly"" is of course a modern telling of the classic ""Beauty and the Beast"" tale. Yet Barnz actually does make the film modern subtly capturing the ways we now communicate where deleting a text message can have an odd finality and offhanded social media updates can depending on context take on significance. As well the casting of the film has a dry subtle wit with Mary-Kate Olsen as the witchy girl with ever-changing hair and high-fashion heels Neil Patrick Harris as a sassy blind tutor and even Peter Krause as the boys father a vain distant newscaster who tells his son by way of life advice ""People like people who look good."" Lets leave aside that even if a girl who looked like Vanessa Hudgens were a bashful bookish outcast shed still be beset upon by hip nerds looking to impress her with poetry they learned from Google before the Beast comes along. Hudgens has an imminently watchable screen presence somehow engaging but reluctantly so; she manages to be emotive and slightly wooden at the same time. The film with its contemporary twist on gothic themes seems designed to appeal to the ""Twilight"" crowd except that they have proven a most fickle group to reach. In her own way Hudgens is at the same career impasse as the ""Twilight"" kids as she gamely struggles to move beyond being that girl from ""High School Musical."" It is a genuine compliment to her that at no point in ""Beastly"" does she seem about to burst into either song or dance. The idea of transformation that people can change and learn from their mistakes growing to be better makes ""Beastly"" not just sweetly romantic but also quietly hopeful. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review In TimeOctober 28 2011Movie Review Sucker PunchMarch 25 2011Movie review HeartbeatsMarch 4 2011Movie review I Am Number FourFebruary 18 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmEntertainmentVanessa HudgensAlex PettyferCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-beastly-20110304,0,6712360.story",200,beastly15,beastly,latimes

Pretty boy Alex Pettyfer runs afoul of witch Mary-Kate Olsen who hits him with an ugly spell. Unless Vanessa Hudgens tells him ""I love you"" hell stay fug forever. This is a throwaway TV-level movie made with a very specific tween demographic in mind and there wont be many fans of it outside that audience. Least of all me. (Rated PG-13 for language brief violence and thematic material.) BEREAVEMENT  This is an example of what happens when a clever proficient filmmaker falls in love with brutal trash. Writer/director/producer/editor/composer Stevan Menas rural slasher flick is gut-wrenchingly grim horrendously gory and ruthlessly efficient at provoking dread and alarm. Alexandra Daddario plays a teenager who unwisely investigates when she sees a young boys face in the window of an abandoned slaughterhouse. Once inside she (and we) get a crash course on all the unpleasant things a madman can do with sharp objects. A ghastly accomplishment not for the nightmare-prone. (R for sadistic bloody violence torture brief nudity and language. Showing at Apple Valley Brooklyn Center Elk River Oakdale and Wynnsong.) A FILM UNFINISHED  Israeli documentarian Yael Hersonski transforms 60 minutes of silent unedited Nazi propaganda film into an electrifying essay on films ability to falsify history. Shot in the infamous Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 it combines documentary images of the starved and suffering inhabitants alongside elaborately staged scenes of wealthy Jews shown living in luxury. Hersonski uses the material and interviews with survivors from the Warsaw Ghetto to examine how we perceive the past what we accept as truth and the nature of propaganda in general. (St. Anthony Main. Unrated in English and subtitled German Yiddish Polish and Hebrew. ) KURONEKO  ""Kuroneko"" is an eerie meticulously plotted samurai ghost story full of gorgeous visual flourishes. Feudal knights are being killed one by one as two women they raped and killed return as sirens to seduce and destroy them. Director Kaneto Shindos 1968 folktale is a theatrical and atmospheric reverie thats worked out with geometric precision. (Uptown. Unrated in subtitled Japanese.) QUEEN OF THE SUN  A honey of a documentary about beekeepers its both an examination of the mysterious alarming colony collapse disorder that has decimated apiaries and an introduction to the eccentric passionate folks who tend bee yards and love their buzzing inhabitants. The theories about how contemporary agricultural practices have contributed to the honeybees disappearance are lucidly explained and the tone is optimistic. If youre looking forward to this springs blooms you owe it to yourself to learn more about the little dynamos that pollinate them. (St. Anthony Main. Unrated.) A SOMEWHAT GENTLE MAN  1/2 From the moment the ever-dignified Stellan Skarsgard steps into view sporting a wispy ponytail you know this Norwegian crime comedy will be a sly delight. He plays Ulrik a newly released killer aiming to go straight as an auto mechanic and to repair his ruptured relationship with his adult son. Meanwhile a small-time crime boss pressures Ulrik to kill the snitch who sent him away in order to restore the ""grand order"" of the universe. Director Hans Petter Moland works in minimalist Scandinavian style earning laughs with offbeat rhythms character quirks and static camera setups that turn the film frame into a single-panel cartoon. The cast is peppered with fine actors in pungent supporting roles from the loquacious garage owner who ends every filibuster with ""thats the way I see it"" to the frumpy landlady who sees Ulrik as more than a tenant. Skarsgaards performance is understated genius; his expressionless participation in the most squirm-inducing sex scene ever filmed will rank high on this years honor roll of comedic highlights. (Lagoon. Unrated in subtitled Norwegian and Lappish.) UNDERTOW  This will forever be remembered as ""the gay Peruvian Ghost."" Macho fisherman Miguel (Cristian Mercado) has a dilemma. Hes a proud father-to-be yet in love with handsome gay outsider Santiago (Manolo Cardona). His staunchly religious village neighbors make it tough for Miguel to express his feelings until Santiago departs and returns in spirit form. Meh. (Lagoon.

And so Kyle who in the clumsy jump-right-into-it opening of Beastly has been elected president of the student body (his platform ""Should you vote for me just because Im the rich popular good-looking guy? Hell yeah"") slinks off to Brooklyn where hes set up with a blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris) and a Jamaican housemaid (Lisa Gay Hamilton).His rich dad (Peter Krause) is too appalled by his sons ""aggressively unattractive"" appearance to keep him at home. Or to even meet him for lunch.The only way to break the spell is to find a girl who will love him as he is. Enter Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) whos all about substance over style and who lets her hair get messy just to prove it. Kyle has a year to reverse the spell before his condition becomes permanent and theres drama with a nasty drug dealer and there are romantic misunderstandings and the fanciful makeover of some prime Brooklyn real estate along the way.Pettyfer the high-cheekboned alien hero of I Am Number Four broods and pouts and runs around heroically sometimes in a hoodie sometimes shirtless. Hudgens of High School Musical lineage exudes cutesy warmth and wistfulness and director Daniel Barnz who did better with his first feature Phoebe in Wonderland moves things from Point A to Point F in barely competent music video style.Sure Beastlys underlying message is a worthy one but by the time the film gets there the audiences ability to empathize will be sorely tested.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

In ""Beastly which opens today youve saved all your pennies for a class trip to Machu Picchu. But your fathers an addict whos shot a thug whose brother has threatened to kill little innocent you. Possibly because hes still strung out your old man leases you to the hooded stranger who witnessed the shooting and more or less blackmails him into making you his. Not that your fathers situation has ever troubled you. Most nights you can be found bopping around a New York that always looks like Canada toting a concession-stand-appropriate box of Jujyfruits. The characterization couldnt be more flagrant if the soundtrack creaked out an oldie by a certain ancient pop quintet Youre a candy girl.In any case lets talk about your predicament. The handsome young man to whom youve been pimped -- I mean handed -- is also a filthy rich Aryan-looking fellow. He once ruled your prep school with the sort of borderline-eugenic iron fist that historically has led to wars and shopping-mall riots. But after messing with the wrong high-fashion witch hes turned into a couture Caliban -- pale skin scars with metallic trim sylvan tattoos. Your classmates think hes chicly Sheenly gone to rehab. Really hes been given a year to find someone compassionate enough to say to him the spell-breaking words ""I love you.That someone is of course you. Which of course is the problem. This entire mess has cost you your trip your education your future and your father. But after Caliban (he wants to be called ""Hunter) leaves boxes of you-know-whats at the door of your quarters in his enormous pied-a-terre which he shares with his badly accented Jamaican maid and blind tutor your giggling nail biting and lower-lip nibbling only intensify. By the time you read Frank OHara together in the greenhouse hes built you then break into someplace called the Carroll Gardens Zoo youre officially his.I know I know. Youre thinking that if Bella can have Edward why cant you have this cheaper fatless knockoff? Its possible you need a break from the dirty mind of ""Twilight. But in favor of a dollar-store ""Beauty and the Beast with no mind at all? Bella would remind you that her life is no After School Special about inner prettiness. Its a soap opera about being hilariously unsexed. (In ""Twilight if they do it somebody might die. Whats your excuse?)The fantasy ""Beastly peddles isnt dissimilar. A cute boy needs you and you want to help him so much you cant notice hes just a pale bike-messenger version of the tan rich guy. Its his ego that needs you not him. That must be why he doesnt seem to mind that you have one facial expression and that its hidden by your bangs.

TWITTER The best thing about this movie -- starring Alex Pettyfer Vanessa Hudgens and Mary-Kate Olsen -- is that its only 86 minutes long. Beastly defies some serious odds in moviemaking in that just about every creative decision with a couple of exceptions has gone very wrong. Bad enough that its makers cravenly chase the gravy train of teen fantasy-melodrama that long ago pulled out of the station with the Twilight series. But the witless manner in which the film desperately searches for the right ideas and moods to convey teen angst is not a pretty sight. Rarely do films from Hollywood emerge in such an inane manner. Its rote characters are inevitably in predictable situations with no subtext or subtlety to any of their predicaments. Box office should be appropriately enough beastly. The adaptation of Alex Flinns novel by writer-director Daniel Barnz (Phoebe in Wonderland) flatters itself that this is a modern update on the Beauty and the Beast legend. An incredibly shallow though popular narcissist Manhattan prep-school senior Kyle (Alex Pettyfer the young British actor who following last months I Am Number Four is not enjoying a good introduction to movie audiences) gets turned into a ""beast"" by a witchy fellow student Kendra (Mary-Kate Olsen). He has a year to find a girl who will say ""I love you"" to his unlovely face or he will be forever beastly. His immediate response is to go into hiding in a luxury condo-hideout provided by his father (Peter Krause) who as a narcissistic broadcast journalist shares his sons distaste for unattractive people so cant wait to eliminate his son from his life. Oh where to begin even at this juncture with the miscalculations? Most obviously Kyle is never made into a beast. As a matter of fact he is much more interesting in his new incarnation with exotic tattoos and razor cuts all over his bald head and body looking like a rapper crossed with an NBA superstar. (For that matter Kendra whom Kyle derides as a ""Frankenskank"" looks pretty hot for a bottle-blond goth.) Moments before his transformation Kyle made friends with a cute fellow student Lindy (High School Musicals Vanessa Hudgens) who likes him despite his obnoxious attitude toward everyone especially women. Well theres no accounting for taste but you dont have to think twice about the source of Kyles salvation. The film does labor to get its hero and heroine together then comes up with an absurd storyline that has Lindys junkie father kill a drug dealer and fearing for his daughters life agree to stash her in Kyles hideaway. Absurdities compound each other Kyle is also joined in his increasingly popular penthouse by a blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris) and a Jamaican maid (LisaGay Hamilton) who must constantly coach the oafish teen on how to woo a girl with things other than good looks. Barnz gives no life to any of these characters nor does he make their situations the least bit believable. Perhaps most disappointing since witchcraft underlies much of what is supposedly happening here is that no sense of magic whatsoever pervades this movie. Not only is every character and plot point lacking in credibility the film doesnt even make the insipid Montreal/Quebec locations fit in with the New York City pickup shots. What are the exceptions to the films countless failures you ask? Well the casting isnt bad although the actors are adrift in thankless roles. Nevertheless Olsen has serious sex appeal Hudgens has a cheerful likable manner Harris and Hamilton are always good value even in bad roles and Pettyfer isnt quite as stiff as he was in I Am Number Four. The other thing and indeed the very best thing about this movie is that its only 86 minutes long. For that you must be grateful.

A preening pretty boy learns to seek beauty beyond outward appearances in ""Beastly"" a brain-dead update of the classic fairy tale whose feeble understanding of its own point runs only skin-deep. In a pic whose message is ""looks dont matter"" casting former model Alex Pettyfer and then cursing him to look more interesting via cool goth tattoos and scars effectively assumes the targeted teen demo is no less superficial though scant admissions should prove otherwise. A kiss may cure the monster but not even campy perfs from Mary-Kate Olsen and Neil Patrick Harris can save this ugly snarl of cliches. Greenlit in the ""me too"" spirit following ""Twilights"" astounding international success ""Beastly"" is based on Alex Flinns trying young-adult novel of the same name an unpleasant first-person tour through the mind of a shallow narcissist named Kyle Kingsbury. British thesp Pettyfer (all grown up from his Alex Rider days to embody the Aryan ideal) plays Kyle BMOC at a posh prep school where student body elections seem to prize the ""body"" over the students. Life comes easy to Kyle who enjoys the privileges afforded the son of a New York newscaster (Peter Krause) including such hand-me-down words of wisdom as ""People like people who look good. Anyone who says otherwise is dumb or ugly."" It all goes to show what Bruce Wayne might have become had thugs failed to off his father at an impressionable age. Such toxic parenting suggests Kyle may still possess the potential for enlightenment which he receives the hard way after crossing witchy classmate Kendra (Olsen memorably over-the-top in her wild hair and raccoon-eyed closeups) the same night he meets his soul mate (Vanessa Hudgens) a far cry from the homely outsider described in the book. Though Kendras magic powers are never explained she manages to transform the generically handsome hunk into an exotic ink-stained bald-headed art specimen with mercury-like rivulets running through his skin. The effect is stunning thanks to impressive prosthetics work by Alterians Tony Gardner (who got his start on ""Thriller"") but fails to describe the kind of disfigurement that would lead a vain teen to withdraw from school and retreat to a palatial penthouse for the rest of the term. Faced with this paradox -- looking better but feeling worse -- Pettyfer proves incapable of conveying Kyles anguish which makes two-thirds of the movie incredibly awkward as more versatile co-stars (including a good-sport Neil Patrick Harris as a vision-impaired but fashion-forward tutor) try to milk chemistry and humor from their interactions with the character. Coming off the dynamite ensemble of ""Phoebe in Wonderland"" writer-director Daniel Barnz seems confounded to encounter such a limited leading man and ill equipped to correct the problem leaving only the scar tissue of heavy editing where shots or entire scenes have been scrapped. Barnz is great with atmosphere however creating memorable locations in which to set otherwise forgettable scenes although pic mostly seems to be marking time until its inevitable resolution. Kyle has one year to convince someone to love him for who he is or risk being left ugly for life but little changes in his character apart from a total loss of self-confidence. And whos to say that ""happily ever after"" means going back to looking like a human Ken doll after all the on- and offscreen magic it took to make him interesting?

"Beastly Ugly is as ugly does | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBeastly Ugly is as ugly doesThe mirror shatters in Beastly but the ugliness is all on the inside in this wretched update of Beauty and the Beast.Vanessa Hudgens as Lindy with Alex Pettyfer as the Beast.  (Takashi Seida Photo)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 3 2011 Beastly (out of 4) Starring Alex Pettyfer Vanessa Hudgens Neil Patrick Harris Lisa Gay Hamilton Mary-Kate Olsen and Peter Krause. Written and directed by Daniel Barnz. 88 minutes. At major theatres. PG One sure sign a fantasy movie has gone off the rails is when its easier to believe the supernatural twist than the everyday life around it. Its no trouble at all buying the Beastlys paranormal premise that spoiled and snotty 17-year-old Kyle Kingston (Alex Pettyfer) is turned punk by vengeful teen witch Kendra (Mary-Kate Olsen). Kyle has to stay this way until he finds a girl or maybe a voodoo doll to love him for who he really is. Hey its a Beauty and the Beast update for the Twilight set and Olsen is indeed pretty scary. Then reality bites and all bets are off. I say ""turned punk"" rather than ""turned hideous"" because Kyle isnt ugly at all. He looks like a tattoo devotee or Grateful Dead fanatic not the hairy clawed ""monster"" described by Alex Flinn author of the source novel. Kyle would be right at home in many clubs on Queen West and I doubt hed have trouble finding someone to rub scars with. Yet were supposed to think that hes so hard to look at even his father (Peter Krause) a shallow TV talking head cant bear the sight of him. Kyle is banished to his rich dads country mansion supposedly in a rural corner of Brooklyn (it was actually filmed near Montreal). While Kyle sulks evil daddyo sends in the reinforcements platitude-spouting housekeeper Zola (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and wisecracking tutor Will (Neil Patrick Harris who actually is pretty funny). Will is blind and his hiring is no accident. Dad fears a sighted teacher might turn to stone when confronted with a student who looks like Lady Gagas goth brother. The ungovernable script by rookie writer/director Daniel Barnz completely loses control with the idiotic contrivance used to get Kyles love interest Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) into the beastly retreat adding the requisite beauty to the fable. Kyle forces Lindy to move in with him by threatening to squeal on some vigilante street justice perpetrated by her pappy. What do you think might upset her more the kidnapping and blackmailing or the overzealous tattoos? But even such clumsy wooing might prove no impediment to true love as long as there are enough roses and poetry to smooth ruffled feathers and personal epiphanies to bring Beastly wheezing to its obvious conclusion. What really grates about this movie apart from the atrocious script direction and acting is the premise that ""unusual"" is synonymous with ""ugly."" The transformed Kyle may no longer be the pretty boy he once was but hes by no means horrific. Google ""tattooed faces"" and youll find all kinds of people who have voluntarily used their mugs as a canvas including a certain pugilist named Mike Tyson who is capable of being beastly when provoked. Are the makers of Beastly afraid that the teen demo would run from the thought of love with anyone who doesnt look like a cover model which Alex Pettyfer actually is? (This movie and I am Number Four should kill all thoughts of an acting career.) Beastly is so dumb and dishonest it cant even hold true to the Hallmark greeting at its core ""Its not how others look at me its how I look at myself."" The mirror shatters but its not because of anything physical.

"Beastly (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Beastly (PG-13) Alex Flinns young adult novel comes to the screen with its pleasures intact. Share Print Save to your profile By Howard Cohen The Miami Herald3/2/2011 Editor rating 3 In the movies love means never having to say youre sorry. But in Beastly pretty boy Kyle Kingsbury (Alex Pettyfer) had better find a way to say hes sorry for being a vainglorious cad or his love affair -- primarily with his mirror -- will be over faster than audiences can say ""Havent we seen this story before?"" Of course we have. Beastly adapted from the young adult novel by Palmetto Bays Alex Flinn is an update of Beauty and the Beast. The main twist is that Flinn tells the story from the point of view of the Beast and placed the characters in high school where as everyone knows looks matter more than calculus. Kyle is hot smart and rich and delights in mocking schoolmates. When he eyes Kendra the school witch (Full Houses Mary Kate-Olsen) he humiliates her at a school function. Kendra retaliates by casting a spell that transforms him into a deformed freak but gives him one way out ""You have a year to find someone to love you or stay like this forever -- as aggressively unattractive inside as you are outside."" Tall order. Screenwriter/director Daniel Barnz wisely tweaks Flinns story for the screen by condensing the action to one year. He also streamlines -- to good effect -- the complex back stories of the secondary characters and alters the appearance of the Beast from the now overly familiar werewolf to a more relatable version in which Pettyfer loses his golden locks and suffers disfigurement via scars and ever-morphing tattoos. Montreals historic downtown where Beastly was filmed stands in as a convincing New York. Of course someone lovely has to enter the equation and find her way into the castle er New York brownstone and in Beastly that role falls to Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens). The callow High School Musical actress with her dreamy dark hair and eyes has become a beautiful young woman. Not surprisingly Kyles smitten. ""Pretty gruesome huh?"" Kyle tells her when he finally works up the nerve to reveal himself.""Ive seen worse"" Lindy replies as emo music swells on the soundtrack. Beastly for all its potential pitfalls works better than it has any right to. Credit Barnz who keeps his young characters contemporary in a world of text messaging and status updates and yet also gives them depth. Pettyfer has to make Kyle loathsome when hes beautiful and soon have audiences feel for his character when all seems hopeless. The 20-year-old Brit who also stars in the teen alien adventure I Am Number Four displays the requisite range. Hudgens has grown into a likable expressive actress. Perhaps most impressive both are able to survive scenes with the hilarious Neil Patrick Harris who plays a blind tutor. If you loved Harris in his recent Emmy-winning guest spot on Glee hes just as amusing in Beastly. Judging by an eager preview audiences hearty reactions in all the right places Barnz briskly-paced engaging Beastly could transform itself into the fledgling studios first real hit -- Hollywoods idea of a real fairy tale ending.

Beastly Bomb Director Daniel Barnz. Cast Alex Pettyfer Vanessa Hudgens Mary-Kate Olsen. Rating PG-13 for language brief violence and thematic material. Guide to this weeks new releases This future camp classic takes ""Beauty and the Beast"" and transports it to a wealthy ""Gossip Girl""-style high school. There we meet Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) who is handsome vacuous and constantly tossing off bitchy one-liners. The role would have been perfect for Rupert Everett in his younger pre-plastic surgery days. After Kyle insults a teen witch (Mary-Kate Olsen) he is turned into a monster. In this case ""monster"" means he has what appear to be tattoos all over his head and body. Even with all the body art he still looks like a chiseled male model; wouldnt it have been crueler to give him a beer belly and cottage-cheese thighs? In standard fairy-tale fashion he needs a woman to tell him she loves him to break the spell and turn him back into his old Adonis self. The love interest comes in the form of Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"" fame) who thanks to some wheezy plot machinations is forced to live with Kyle. Pettyfer is currently on display in the sci-fi flick ""I Am Number Four"" in which he gives a workmanlike performance. But he is virtually Laurence Olivier in that movie compared with what he does here. He is stiff and robotic and lacks the necessary attitude to pull off the pre-beastly Kyle or the sensitivity to play the monstrous one. The British actor also has some difficulty masking his accent which could be why at times it sounds like he is speaking his lines phonetically. Hudgens isnt shown to particularly good advantage either; of course she is also forced to say things like ""I guess this cage set me free"" with a straight face. Also lost in the rubble are talented Lisa Gay Hamilton (""Men of a Certain Age"") slumming as a housekeeper who dispenses old-country wisdom. She fares better than Neil Patrick Harris hamming it up as Kyles blind tutor ""At 15 my friends lost their virginity and I lost my sight"" the character announces at one point. The line is meant to be serious yet is funnier than all of his would-be comedic bits. Its that kind of movie. The whole affair is an obnoxious waste of time.
