Comments (11) click to enlarge Creed Video Rated PG-13  133 minutes  2015 Sylvester Stallone hands off the Rocky saga to writer-director Ryan Coogler who makes the aging Italian Stallion the corner man for a younger boxer who is the illegitimate son of his old adversary Apollo Creed. Cooglers acclaimed debut feature Fruitvale Station (2013) dealt with the real-life police killing of an unarmed black man in San Francisco but in keeping with Stallones wholesome formula for the Rocky movies theres no racial angle here just a lot of daddy issues. Michael B. Jordan who played the victim in Fruitvale Station injects some juice as Adonis Creed and the muttering Stallone has a few ostensibly touching moments. But anyone hoping the franchise might open out into new thematic territory will be disappointed; this is the same old ritual from the amped-up training sequences to the climactic title fight with its absurd number of punches landed in every round.

Coming 39 years after the original film starring Sylvester Stallone the movie certainly has its share of training montages and struggles against adversity as well as an endearing romance between a young fighter and a woman from the neighborhood. But Creed is also necessarily fresh giving beneficial tweaks to an old formula. Audiences will still likely see every punch coming from a mile away but whats remarkable is how the movie lands them all Its an invigorating piece of nostalgia that fuels a bigger adrenaline rush with its climax than any big-budget blockbuster could provide.Related Story Will Warrior Make You Care About Mixed Martial Arts? Its worth remembering that the original Rocky is a great film both overshadowed and enhanced by its bombastic sequels. While later films saw the lovable Philadelphian Rocky Balboa fight Mr. T conquer the Soviet Union and own a talking robot the first movie is a touching character study of a mumbling distant sweet-natured guy who gets an unprecedented shot at fame. Creed revives that character giving Stallone his best part in decades as the retired champ now puttering away in an Italian restaurant he owns. But it wisely invests most of its running time in its compelling new protagonist Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan playing the son of Rockys deceased rival Apollo) and in giving the old rags-to-riches story a clever spin.Adonis (or ""Don"") is the forgotten son of a superstar whose mother died at a young age. The film introduces him as a kid brawling with other boys in juvie before hes taken in by Apollos widow (Phylicia Rashad). While Rocky strived to escape the drudgery of life as a local unknown Adonis has a cushy-looking white-collar job which doesnt stop him from feeling drawn to the world of boxing by the memory of his father killed in the ring in Rocky IV before he was born. That leads him to Philadelphia where he connects with his dads greatest rival and eventual friend and well you can guess the rest.Its a heady embrace of whats come before but Jordan and the director Ryan Coogler (who scripted with Aaron Covington) infuse it with the visual energy and real-world grit the Rocky series has lacked since the first film. Adoniss first fight is performed in one bravura take Cooglers camera dipping in and around the action with confidence. Jordan invests his performance with notes of suppressed rage and dopey charm. He creates the kind of real-world tough guy Stallone did so well in 1976 tapping into the magnetic star presence he showed in Cooglers previous film Fruitvale Station.Youll see every punch coming from a mile away but whats remarkable is how Creed still lands them all.That film Cooglers debut was a retelling of the last day of Oscar Grants life before he was shot dead unarmed by police in an Oakland subway station--a tragedy reflective of the dangers many young African American men face. Compared to that Creed is a work of escapist fantasy. But Coogler and Jordan nonetheless create a protagonist of color who avoids the stereotypes of many of Hollywoods black heroes while still being celebrated as one. Adonis is an easy hero for everyone to cheer for but hes not thinly painted. Scenes where he runs through Philadelphia followed by cheering kids on bikes are especially memorable--they celebrate the films myth-making without putting the hero on an unreachable pedestal.Along with that Coogler has crafted an homage to the Rocky series with authentic affection referencing many of the greatest and corniest moments--chasing chickens in the backyard Rocky and Apollos secret final fight. At the same time Creed transcends every one of the franchises sequels. Notably its the first Rocky film without Stallones name on the script but he shines instead in his quiet nuanced supporting turn as the aging fighter.Stallone has never been the most versatile actor but he layers his original performance with the steeliness that comes with encroaching mortality. As a career performance it doesnt feel far off from Clint Eastwoods turn in Million Dollar Baby After years of playing hard men both finally get to embrace the youthful energy of their onscreen protege. And in sidestepping many of the pitfalls that come with continuing a beloved franchise the film invites viewers to revel in the old glory days without simply trying to recreate them. It might be obvious when the horns are about to blare but its thrilling nonetheless.

Twitter Email previousThanksgiving at the White House The Menu Changes More Than the Silverware nextChina Wants to Build Sponge Cities Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Michael B. Jordan in Creed. Ryan Cooglers film has an unexpected grace that makes it much more than just a Rocky reboot Sometimes when a movie does everything right you dont even think about how wrong it could have gone until after its over. Creed out Nov. 25 could have gone wrong in so many ways. Directed by Ryan Coogler--whose deft 2013 debut Fruitvale Station chronicled the last day of Oscar Grant III before he was fatally shot by a BART police officer in Oakland--Creed introduces us to the illegitimate son of heavyweight champ Apollo Creed who first bounded into the ring in the 1976 underdog hit Rocky. In a movie landscape littered with resuscitated franchises this runs the risk of being just more of the same. Like Rocky a smash that spawned 1000 sequels (or so it seems) Creed mingles go-for-broke romance with bloody pugilist thrills--but instead of feeling like a rehash it works like gangbusters. Coogler honors and builds upon the Rocky formula so that it feels both comfortingly old-fashioned and bracingly new. Audiences instantly adored Rocky for good reason--its a great date movie and Creed is too. You wont have to be a lover-not-a-fighter to love it. Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan who played Grant in Fruitvale Station) spent much of his childhood bouncing in and out of group homes. His mother who gave birth to him after an illicit liaison with the champ Apollo died when he was very young. Hes an angry kid with no outlet for his feelings until a woman hes never met Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) comes to collect him and raise him as if he were her own. Mary Anne it turns out is Apollo Creeds widow and its easy to guess how much suffering her husbands infidelity must have caused. Yet never in Creed is she given a line of dialogue explaining why she rescued Adonis--her need to do so is part of her being and Coogler (who co-wrote the script with Aaron Covington) trusts the audience to understand that. Naturally boxing is in Adonis blood even though hes now a responsible adult with a good job--and an eagerness not to disappoint his adoptive mother--he cant help sneaking off to Tijuana to hone his chops in the ring. His yearning to claim his paternal legacy and to build his own name eventually takes him to Philadelphia where he tracks down his fathers old opponent Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) eventually persuading the long-retired slugger to train him. He also meets a woman Tessa Thompsons Bianca a gifted singer who happens to be losing her hearing. Thats the stuff of melodrama and its also part of what makes Creed so pleasurable Coogler understands that intensified circumstances arent things to be laughed at--theyre like cushions where we can rest our own unresolved feelings for a while and theyre the stuff of great art and popular art alike. Coogler keeps everything moving so gracefully that by the end of Creed we almost dont know what hit us. In an early stunning sequence Adonis calls up one of his fathers old fights on YouTube--its Creed vs. Rocky Balboa--and projects it on a wall big as life. He cant keep himself from leaping right into the action figuratively joining the dance He jabs at his fathers ghostly onscreen image trying to work out a lifetimes worth of frustration with every punch. Later a flesh-and-blood match between Adonis and an egotistical Philadelphia scrapper is shot in one take with floating precision The camera swirls around the fighters as if it were capturing the movement of two leaves in the wind. The pictures climactic fight in which Adonis squares off against an undefeated Liverpool thug (real-life UK boxer Tony Bellew) is far more brutal and visceral though no less gorgeous When Adonis takes a rock-hard punch to the jaw we see him go down in excruciating slow motion--the flesh of his cheeks is silk billowing in the wind reminding us that all faces even those of boxers who have learned to take a punch are things of exceptional fragility. Jordans face in particular is the kind you feel protective of. Hes charismatic in a totally carefree way--you never catch him trying too hard and his scenes with Thompson have a lovely bantering lyricism. But his truest comrade is Stallone whos wonderful here. Rocky Balboa is the most vivid character of Stallones lifetime and he slips right into it like a pair of sweats that have permanently taken the shape of their owner. Stallones face doesnt have the loose softness that it should considering hes 69. Hes worked too hard at preserving the firmness of youth when what made his mug so beautiful in the first place was its shy revealing malleability. Even so its a kisser with some character It looks stylized like a 1976 artists rendering of what Rocky Balboa might look like in 2015. Sometimes you need an old dude to create a context for beautiful young people. Stallone does that and more in Creed. Looks like another love TKO.

Jordan as Adonis Johnson in a scene from Creed. Barry Wetcher/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa and Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson in a scene from Creed. Barry Wetcher/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures Remember Rocky? That cornpone boxing movie from 40 years ago starring (and written by) that oiled-up headband-wearing buffoon who talks funny? The one that stole Best Picture away from Network All the Presidents Men Taxi Driver and Hal Ashbys rather more obscure Woody Guthrie biopic Bound for Glory? Okay on that last point youre technically correct; on the rest youre dead wrong. Rocky is one of those movies thats been retroactively devalued by its sequels. Its somber and observant more about the day-to-day of a shy Philadelphia hood with a crush on the girl at the pet store than about boxing for the first hour of its 119 minutes. Heres the other thing you might not recall Rocky loses his fight with Apollo Creed at the end. He ""merely"" survives the 15-round crucible proving to himself hes not a coward or a quitter. Perhaps because of Bill Contis intrepid score Rockys inspirational qualities have tended to overshadow its existential ones but theyre equally vital. Of its sequels only 2006s Rocky Balboa had humility and brio in something like the same proportions as the original. Arriving 30 years after we first saw Rocky huff his way up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art it was a meditation on loss and mortality and raging against the dying of the light (though writer-director-star Sylvester Stallone was kind enough to leave Dylan Thomas unmentioned). As Rocky puts it in the marvelous new Creed ""Time takes everybody out. Times undefeated."" Hes speaking to Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) the illegitimate son of his opponent-turned-pal Apollo Creed who died in the early rounds of 1985s Rocky IV. (Youre an educated person; surely youve seen these movies and read them in the original Greek.) In a prologue set in 1998 Creeds well-off widow (Phylicia Rashad) rescues the combative young Adonis from a Los Angeles juvenile detention center and adopts him. In the present day ""Donny"" is a college-educated man with a good job and a bright future. But he is his absentee fathers son competing in unsanctioned fights in Mexico on the sly. When he decides to go pro he cant get anyone to train him. The last 15 years of his life have been luxe; no one including his adopted mom thinks hes hungry enough to survive in the ring. So he packs himself off to the City of Brotherly Love to look up Rocky. Donny never knew his old man but so powerful is his craving for one that right away hes calling Rocky ""Unc"" as in Uncle--which feels about as natural as if he were addressing this old white dude hes just met as ""Italian Stallion."" (This is Creeds hardest-to-swallow turn. If you can get past it youll probably love the movie as much as I did.) Rocky wants no part of this. When hes not at the little Italian restaurant he named for his wife Adrian who succumbed to cancer sometime after Rocky V hes at the cemetery where she and his brother-in-law Paulie are buried reading the paper aloud to their headstones. Hes at peace knowing his life will follow this humble pattern until it ends. But not completely at peace because--surprise--eventually he agrees to give Donny a few tips. You wonder if a similar lobbying campaign took place off-screen. This is the first Rocky flick Stallone neither wrote nor directed. Hes entrusted his beloved creation to Ryan Coogler the 29-year-old black filmmaker whose sole stunning prior feature was Fruitvale Station a fact-based drama about the 2009 killing of an unarmed-and-handcuffed black man named Oscar Grant by a white police officer in Oakland California. (Jordan played Grant.) At first glance this looks like yet another case of a promising artist with a strong but still-developing voice getting drafted into the Franchise Wars... ...which Id probably wring my hands over a whole lot more if Creed were not so against-all-odds wonderful. Its a warm-hearted patient unabashedly tear-jerking drama one that gets its juice not from the training montages (though theyre stirring) or the bouts (though theyre convincingly performed and excitingly shot) but from the remarkable chemistry between Jordan and Stallone. Tessa Thompson is great too as a musician suffering from degenerative irony--sorry I mean ""gradual hearing loss."" But her nicely slow-moving courtship with Jordan is only the movies secondary love affair. Jordan is already much more famous than Stallone was when Rocky snagged him a Best Actor nomination in 1976. His character Donny is handsome educated and brimming with confidence--Rockys opposite in every respect save for his drive to prove himself. The alter ego that gave Stallone a career has always been the one that most resembles him offscreen. Just like Rocky Balboa Stallone became a huge unlikely star but handled his success poorly. He allowed his vanity to speak louder than his talent. For a long time he kept trying writing and directing ambitious clunkers in between Rocky and Rambo sequels. But audiences never embraced his more challenging stuff. Eventually he threw up his hands and made only films he mustve known were garbage for years on end. While Creed is not exactly Stallones Unforgiven it certainly benefits from the weariness and regret in his face which somehow seems at last to have wrinkled away the strange uncanny-valley aspect of his appearance that has fueled so much speculation about plastic surgery. Whether the credit goes to the director or the actor or both this is the performance of Stallones career one in which that age-defying orange body stays covered up but his sadness is in full view. While one hopes Coogler wont stay in franchiseville after Creed he can feel good about having made an honorable heart-tugging crowd-pleaser that should attract a more diverse crowd to the series while satisfying older fans with the best Rocky movie since Rocky. The last half-year has seen films like Jurassic World Terminator Genisys and Spectre so busy paying homage to their forebears that any new tricks they might have get upstaged. Coogler perfectly threads the needle between innovation and reverence keeping the familiar Rocky signposts--the Conti theme the training montages those museum steps--present but recontextualized. He puts his own stamp on the series obligatory scenes with a training sequence that is almost a dance number wherein neighborhood kids ride their motorbikes and four-wheelers alongside Donny as hes running. They form a circle around him as he leaps into the air imagining his victory. Theres a lot of movie left after this but the emotional climax is right here. Theyve always peaked early these Rocky pictures; with Creed the series peaks again.

Celebrities Who Have Left Scientology Creed Sly Stallone resurrects Rocky in this crowdpleasing tale of the champ training Apollo Creeds son Sylvester Stallone left and Michael B. Jordan in Creed. Credit Barry Wetcher By Peter Travers November 25 2015 More News The Trouble with Sylvester Stallone Are Prequels Killing Movie Franchises? Stallone Rep No Official Remark on Rambo Future Spectre How the Multiverse Era Killed James Bond All Stories >> Hot damn We have a winner. Fruitvale Station director Ryan Coogler 29 turbocharges the Rocky franchise in Creed. His focus Adonis Johnson (a stellar Michael B. Jordan) the bastard son of late champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) the father he never knew. The kid needs Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) to train him. Just enough plot for Jordan to strut his impressive stuff and for a never-better Stallone to play the aging boxer with more feeling than Ive seen from him since the original. The first Rocky in 1976 took the Oscar for Best Picture beating out All the Presidents Men Network and Taxi Driver a fact that makes cinema buffs nuts to this day. Point taken. But theres no denying the crowdpleasing impact of the first Rocky as Stallone the underdog beat the odds by forcing the studios to let him star as the boxer he created. Even though Stallones six sequels could never match his first time out Rocky is movie history. More News The Trouble with Sylvester Stallone Are Prequels Killing Movie Franchises? Stallone Rep No Official Remark on Rambo Future Spectre How the Multiverse Era Killed James Bond All Stories >> Related Why Creed Is the Greatest Underdog Movie Since Rocky Franchise reboot has become a box-office phenomenon -- because it understands that winning isnt everything Creed is the first of the Rocky films that Stallone didnt write. Youd expect resentment. After all who is this Coogler kid to tell Stallone how Rocky should behave? Heres the thing Coogler says he used to watch the Rocky films with his father making his version a love letter to the series not a correction. You can feel Cooglers affection for the material in every frame. Hell the story Coogler cooked up with co-writer Aaron Covington is a virtual template  of the first film. Adonis -- Donny to his buds -- came up out of foster homes a chip firmly ensconced on his shoulder. Its Apollos widow (Phylicia Rashad) forgiving her husbands infidelity  who saves the boy from the system and takes him into her lush Los Angeles home. But Donny stays a troublemaker taking fights in Mexico to work out the rage inside. From the minute Donny decides his dads old friend Rocky is the only guy who can train him hes off to Philadelphia where Rocky runs a restaurant named Adrians after his late wife the script practically writes itself. The good news is that Coogler puts his own stamp on it. You can feel this fine indie talent stretching his wings in the mainstream. The first fight scene gorgeously shot by the great Maryse Alberti looks to be done in one long take and the effect is stunning. Even the romance Donny has with his own Adrian Ramp;B singer Bianca (a terrific Tessa Thompson) feels sexually frisky and freshly conceived. Okay Donnys rush from nowhere to taking on the  current champ ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan -- played by real-life Brit boxer Tony ""Bomber"" Bellew -- is the purest of fantasy. But who cares? Donny has Rocky in his corner. And Stallone grabs us from his first ""how you doin?"" The big fight held at Liverpools Goodison Park is as pow as youd expect. The score by Ludwig Goransson has a righteous right-now feel only topped when Bill Contis iconic theme pops in at just the right moment.  And its just plain shameless to see Rocky on those Philly steps one more time. But the beating heart of the movie comes when Donny and Rocky mix it up. So irresistible is Stallones blend of tough and tender that Oscar should give him points. You heard me.

Jordan cut like an Abercrombie amp; Fitch model) of 2013s Fruitvale Station re-team for a Rocky remake retooled for Generation Affirmation. Their first collaboration had a real-life tragedy to ground it. This one unfortunately has an increasingly fantastical franchise to give it wings. It seems that retired boxing champ Rocky Balboas old friend Apollo Creed (RIP) had an affair and a son. His widow graciously rescues the boy from juvie and gives him a good life but he chucks it to climb into the ring where Daddy died. Why o why? The answer long in coming makes little sense but sounds cool so just go with it. Theres a lot of that sort of thing. Sylvester Stallone low-keys it and still overshadows his protege mostly because hes playing a person and not the living embodiment of Doing It My Way and Believing I Can Do It. But not even Rocky can deliver a line like ""Its you against you; hes just in the way"" without sounding ridiculous. Coogler and cinematographer Maryse Alberti do manage some nice close camerawork during the Big Fight so theres that. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

No wait hold those trumpets at least for now. Creed is not that kind of Rocky movie. Its not quite Rocky VII and not just because Sylvester Stallones Rocky Balboa is old and on the sidelines ceding the spotlight to a young African-American boxer played by Michael B. Jordan. Two years ago its director Ryan Coogler collaborated with Jordan on Fruitvale Station which depicted the senseless death of a 22-year-old black man named Oscar Grant at the hands of a Bay Area policeman. Thats one kind of story one vital way of framing the world through African-American male eyes alongside Ta-Nehisi Coatess Between the World and Me and Black Lives Matter. Creed is another. Its a Hollywood story which Coogler gets He even gives his protagonist -- the illegitimate son of ex-heavyweight champion Apollo Creed -- the initially derisive nickname ""Hollywood."" But Creed represents a kind of Hollywood fantasy that doesnt have to be specious focusing on pride determination self-control hard work and forging ones own identity. Movies dont always have to be ""how things are."" When theyre as warm and rousing as Creed they can be ""how we want to make things."" Its a hell of a movie a funny mix of corn and street street corn. Jordans character Adonis Johnson is a mixture of elements too. He never knew his father who was killed in the ring in the absurd Rocky IV -- a film thats in a different sphere than this one. His mother died; he grew up in foster homes and juvy halls. Then Creeds widow Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) adopted him so he lives in a Los Angeles mansion and is fast-tracked for success in a brokerage firm. Mary Anne doesnt want him to box. She says ""You are your fathers son and youre part of him but it doesnt mean you have to be him."" No one in his fathers old orbit will train Adonis so he trains himself. Perhaps the movies strangest most indelible image is Adonis standing before a big-ass state-of-the-art video screen mirroring punches thrown by his dad against Rocky Balboa. So to whom else should he go to be trained? I know shameless. And so good The setting Philadelphia. The place the restaurant named for Rockys dead wife Adrian. Here comes Stallones Balboa -- thickened his nose squashed shuffling out of the basement ""Hows it goin?"" He doesnt know who Adonis is but when he does he says re training boxers ""I dont do that stuff no more."" We have to accept that dramatic beat even though we know whats coming and the next beat too in which Adonis heads to the late Mickeys old gym and is met with indifference. He doesnt tell anyone hes Apollos son you see. He wants to make it on his own -- even though the entire plot turns on his celebrity bloodline. The movie has it both ways and pulls it off. Like I said street corn. Note the camera placement. Rocky visits his wife and brother-in-law Pauley at the cemetery pulling up a chair filling them in on his life reading the paper with Stallone nestled in the landscape the city behind him. When you go back and watch the original Rocky what might hit you is how the director John G. Avildsen kept Rocky a Capra-esque Everyman (or Everypalooka) in an indifferent universe. But Stallone wasnt happy with that -- or at least his dad wasnt telling his son (according to interviews) that Slys physique looked a bit puny. For the sequels Stallone built himself up and took control of the camera bringing it close making himself loom large in the frame -- and turning himself into a joke. Maybe he made a fortune but he killed what made many of us like him. (Look at First Blood for the same trajectory. A good moving thriller with Stallone fighting against an indifferent universe compared to Rambo which showed a cartoon muscleman shot from way down low ""What you call hell he calls home."") In Creed Stallone is as gosh-darn lovable as he was in Rocky. He dons his specs and reads while young Adonis jumps rope to the point of near-collapse. This time the requisite training montage isnt Rocky building himself up but Rocky acting as a tough dad (actually Adonis calls him ""Unc"" when not calling him ""O"" as in ""O.G."") whos amused by his own mock-sadistic tactics. ""One step at a time one punch at a time one round at a time"" he tells his pupil. Its not the big picture but the small one. Get yourself right. Coogler (who wrote the script with Aaron Covington) doesnt underline the ""racial harmony"" aspect of the narrative but its in every shot. Apollos and Rockys worlds intersect Theres Meek Mill rap and Bill Contis Rocky theme side-by-side on the soundtrack. Rocky is ""old-school"" and so now is Adonis Johnson-Creed. And so is Michael B. Jordan who makes Adoniss cockiness a product of will and not entitlement. The story is outlandish of course but Coogler has a savvy boxers way of hitting you from directions you cant predict. The movie stalls on the brink of the first big fight when Adonis tells Rocky to unlace his gloves quickly because he suddenly has the shits. We havent stopped giggling over that sly bit of myth-busting when Maryse Albertis camera starts following Rocky and Adonis and their entourage into the ring -- and the shot is held and held and held a bravura piece of cinematography and fight choreography in which the camera moves in and out in and out dancing and swerving along with the boxers. Tessa Thompson -- who showed she had the makings of a star as the plucky heroine of Dear White People -- plays the impossibly adorable singer-songwriter who lives downstairs from Adonis and becomes the movies designated female cringer watching her mans blood spatter over the canvas. In addition to singing and cringing though her character has a hook She has progressive hearing loss -- shes going deaf. But still she makes music one note at a time one song at a time ... The secret of Creed -- of so many of the best go-for-it movies -- is that its grounded in loss death mortal illness disability. The setting for the finale -- the light-heavyweight world championship -- is so preposterous that even the characters express skepticism over why theyre there. But Coogler doesnt let himself get meta. He might not believe in the reality of Creed but he puts every bit of faith and skill he has in the reality of the dream.

Jordan as Adonis Johnson Creed in ""Creed."" By  John Wenzel | jwenzeldenverpost.com PUBLISHED November 24 2015 at 956 am | UPDATED April 19 2016 at 956 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Former Japanese consulate residence hits the Denver market for 4.2 million Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Blake Shelton plays free intimate show at Denvers Grizzly Rose Tennis-ball-sized hail knocks out 27 Colorado Springs police cars Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie If ""Creed"" feels like it has a lot of weight on its muscular shoulders its because it does. Boxing films are an art unto themselves from 1931s Jackie Cooper vehicle ""The Champ"" to Martin Scorseses brutally accomplished ""Raging Bull."" We cant help but wince at the visceral hits and finding ways to portray the external and internal struggle of a boxer remains endlessly fascinating to filmmakers. ""Creed"" which is either the next entry in the checkered ""Rocky"" franchise or a reboot carries this weight effortlessly. Like a superhero origin story its full of self-discovery and training but not much fighting. That turns out to be a good thing with the magnetic 28-year-old Michael B. Jordan in the lead role. Director Ryan Coogler who worked with Jordan on 2013s (still) painfully relevant ""Fruitvale Station"" lends his deft touch to the story of Adonis Johnson Creed -- the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) from the first four ""Rocky"" films. Jordan whom we last saw as the Human Torch in the ill-fated ""Fantastic Four"" reboot is a bit too precise and fresh-faced to pull off the constant brooding thats been written for the young Creed. But its impossible not to root for him as he sheds a life of comfort and the doting of his adopted mother Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad at her matronly best as Creeds widow) for a journey of monastic self-discovery. The setup is swift and not entirely airtight as Adonis decamps to Philadelphia to seek out the training of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) who now runs a modest Italian restaurant named Adrians. The city breathes in satisfying establishing shots and Coogler plays with the series iconic imagery as Jordan jogs around in a hoodie even visiting the real-life ""Rocky"" statue at the Philadelphia Museum of Arts famous steps. A reluctant family dynamic takes shape as Adonis trains with Rocky in secret never wanting to trade on his name but always desperate to prove that his fathers strength flows through him. Self-conscious jokes conspicuous product placement and a perfunctory love story (featuring Tessa Thompson saddled with the role of a brash moody songwriter whos going deaf) somehow never really ding the films momentum. Boxing films challenge and engage every part of the lead actor and during training montages -- as well as a mid-film match that looks like a single graceful take -- Jordan oozes confidence in his abilities. Getting the rhythm and feel of an intense match is more art than sweet science but audiences know when something feels off even if theyre not experts on boxings technical aspects. The coup is how Coogler and his team handle complicated themes without words whats the difference between luck and opportunity? The distinction between things cultivated and things that fall into your lap? Can we -- and should we even want to -- escape our past? ""Rocky"" certainly wasnt the first or best boxing film but its influence can be felt in nearly every boxing film since from its montages and urban setting to hard-won bittersweet victories that involve personal sacrifice and tragedy. Against the odds ""Creed"" is a proud successor to both 1976s original ""Rocky"" and the genre in general with a surprisingly powerful turn from Stallone as the character that made him famous. Jordans portrayal by necessity doesnt always have the same layers but it does solve a problem endemic to many boxing movies. Recent films like ""The Fighter"" and ""Southpaw"" had an off-putting dourness that (while more realistic in their tone) didnt always make for cheer-worthy entertainment. But ""Creed"" stirs emotions with a strong yet artful hand. The origin-story undercurrent in which everything comes together beautifully at the last moment feels earned. Jordans clear-eyed starring role is the heart but a muscular frame surrounds and carries it. The script characters and legacy of this four-decade franchise cohere to land a convincing and emotional knockout at the end. Cue the theme song.

Jordan) gets put through his paces by Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). (Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures) Joe Dziemianowicz NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday November 25 2015 400 AM Title Creed Film Info Starring Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan. Ex-boxing champ Rocky Balboa trains the son of a deceased rival. (212) PG-13 for for violence language and some sensuality. Area theaters ""Creed"" packs a mighty punch. Its the seventh film in the ""Rocky"" series and it certainly sticks to a familiar feel-good formula but director Ryan Coogler (""Fruitvale Station"") turns out an exciting amusing and well-acted crowd-pleaser. Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky Balboa natch. Since 1976 the Italian Stallion has been his bread and butter. This is the first film Stallone didnt write or direct; he just acts -- and boy does he. Sporting his trademark pork-pie hat and god-awful glasses that couldve been Rockys dearly departed wife Adrians he checks any trace of vanity. He piles on enough heavyweight blue-collar charm to knock your socks off. Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) is the illegitimate son of ""Rocky"" legend Apollo Creed. (Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures) Matching him in the magnetism department is Michael B. Jordan whos chiseled and believable as Adonis ""Donnie"" Johnson the illegitimate son of Rockys late rival and friend Apollo Creed. Donnie never knew his dad and cant make peace with that. Or with himself. Or with his rage. He doesnt even use his famous dads last name. Since he was a kid his lifes been one brawl after another. In the opening moments Apollos wife (Phylicia Rashad whos great) takes the troubled 10-year-old into her palatial home. More than a decade later Donnie has to fight. And goes to Philadelphia to convince Rocky to mentor him. After various training montages Donnie finds himself in fights of his life with more experienced boxers -- first in Philly followed by an even bigger match in Liverpool. Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson in ""Creed."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) The David-versus-Goliath echo is straight out of the 1976 ""Rocky."" Sure its corny but it still works. All the more so since fight scenes pack such visceral punches. Of course youd expect a boxing movie to deliver the body blows but whats surprising are the various tender caresses the movie delivers. Theyre there between Donnie and aspiring musician Bianca (Tessa Thompson very good) whos losing her hearing and determined to make music while she can. Its there when Rocky gets felled by illness. Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) gets put through his paces by Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). (Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures) Dont need to be fluent in the Rocky legend or give a whit about boxing to appreciate this tale of fathers and sons and legacies and love. ""One step one punch"" Rocky tells Donnie as he trains. The boxing ring is just the world at large. Were all just trying to get through the next round.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Nov. 24 2015 246PM EST Last updated Tuesday Nov. 24 2015 341PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ryan Coogler Written by Ryan Coogler and Aaron Covington Starring Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone Classification 14A Year 2015 Country USA Language English A young boxer with something to prove teams up with a veteran trainer and signs on for the fight of his life against a reigning world champ who looks all set to destroy our spunky hero. Youve heard this tale often most obviously in the original Rocky movie the inspiring underdog tale that launched many less-inspired sequels. Now Creed the seventh in the series replays the original plot but this time Sylvester Stallone has finally handed over the gloves to the next generation. His long-delayed transformation into a trainer is believable enough as is the movie that surrounds him - but no more than that. For the first time in the series Stallone did not write the script yet director Ryan Coogler and his co-writer Aaron Covington arent exactly brimming over with fresh ideas Worn thin with repetition the sentimental old premise muffles suspense and dampens emotion.After a bit of back story the movie begins as the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed comes looking for Rocky Balboa hoping his dead fathers old brother-in-arms will train him. Rocky who has lost his wife and his fortune in previous movies is now running the family restaurant and living alone in the same working-class neighbourhood in north Philadelphia from which he sprang. After some requisite foot-dragging he quickly returns to the gym to help Adonis (a.k.a. Don) Johnson (soon to be known as Creed) prepare for a quick-knock down of a local tough. Soon theyve agreed to a bigger fight against ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan a British world champ who needs the publicity after a brush with the law.Stallone looks like a wreck but more in the manner of a man who has gone 12 rounds with his plastic surgeon than one who has battled Apollo Creed and Ivan Drago. Still the casting works well enough hes old and lumbering and he owns the character of the good-hearted marble-mouthed boxer now plausibly diminished as he lives out a lonely retirement without the sense of purpose that raised him above the streets in the first place.Meanwhile Michael B. Jordan is a pleasant presence as the striving new Creed but the title character is both confused and confusing. In the films opening scenes we get a bracing glimpse of a juvenile detention centre indistinguishable from a prison and are told Apollo Creeds offspring from an affair has spent the years after his mothers death here or in foster homes. Then hes rescued by Creeds magnanimous widow who lives in a Los Angeles mansion where we meet up with him a decade later. Supposedly this boy is the bastard son striving to prove his legitimacy but he looks like hes spent the second half of his young life cuddling in the familys very luxurious lap.Neither the director nor Jordan himself can figure out if the new Creed has any street cred and the notion that this buff young gentleman is going to beat anyone in the ring evaporates the minute the actor appears beside real-life boxers in particular the Liverpool heavyweight Tony Bellew who plays ""Pretty"" Ricky - very effectively - as an intensely focused Merseyside thug.A compelling Tessa Thompson plays Dons neighbour and love interest a club singer with progressive hearing loss and their frank contemporary scenes along with the love-worn Philly setting add a certain much-needed naturalism to the equation. Cooger adds a few visual flourishes - a fire eater appears in a darkened arena; Philly youth pull wheelies on their motor bikes - that give Creed a bit of new style but mainly the movie is same old same old.It ends as the trainer and his protege climb those famous steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art - very very slowly. Both Rocky and Stallone know better than to embarrass themselves here; the rush of the original ascent is a thing of the past.

Jordan star in ""Creed.""       Photo Barry Wetcher MOVIE REVIEW Creed Running time 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence profanity sensuality). Nine years after we thought Sylvester Stallone wrapped up his durable franchise on a high note with ""Rocky Balboa"" hes back to pass the torch in style with Ryan Cooglers ""Creed"" one of the years warmest and most crowd-pleasing surprises. It seems that before Rockys opponent-turned-pal Apollo Creed died in ""Rocky 4"" he planted the seed for this spinoff during an extramarital affair. As we see in a prologue set in 1998 the angry Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is adopted by Creeds widow (Phylicia Rashad) out of a juvenile detention facility after his mothers death. Comfortably raised in Los Angeles Adonis is conflicted about his legacy moonlighting for prizefights in Mexico from his financial-services job. Finally he quits and heads to Philadelphia and the only man in the world who can help him figure out whether he can live up to the achievements of the father hes never known. It comes as no surprise that Rocky has thrown in the gloves after the deaths of Adrian and Paulie and manages Adrians restaurant as quietly as he can even if he is the most famous celebrity in the city. At first he wants no part of coaching Adonis but something about the young mans determination touches Rocky. This results in a training montage that demonstrates writer-director Coogler (of the indie sensation ""Fruitvale Station"") not only respects but totally gets what made the original underdog classic win the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. Sylvester Stallone (left) and Michael B. Jordan.Photo Barry Wetcher Working with a gifted director and the first ""Rocky"" script that he does not have a credited hand in Stallone responds with one of his most careful and nuanced performances in years as he becomes heavily involved in his new proteges life. That life includes a terrific Tessa Thompson as Bianca a feisty and supportive musician who is losing her hearing and has no time for Adonis bouts of self-pity. Or his acting out when Adonis illustrious parentage becomes public after his first fight under Rockys expert tutelage. Its his Apollo connection that gets the unranked Adonis a shot at a title bout -- British lightweight champ ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (real-life boxer Tony Bellew a screen natural) needs a high-profile match to provide for his family before being sent to prison on a gun charge. The weary Rocky meanwhile has his own life-or-death battle to fight outside the ring. Stallone and Jordan (who was in ""Fruitvale Station"" and the unfortunate ""Fantastic Four"" reboot) have great chemistry together as their characters urge each other not to give up. Even as someone who was never a huge fan of the series I found myself misting up at the final scene in ""Creed"" that in less sure hands would have been unbearably schmaltzy. Hopefully the new iteration of ""Star Wars"" (which bowed a year after the ""Rocky"" saga) will be able to deliver a knockout punch like this for its seventh outing in December.

Review Rocky revitalized in heartfelt Creed Tom Long The Detroit News 710 p.m. EST November 24 2015Michael B. Jordan right as Adonis Johnson and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa in a scene from the movie ""Creed.""(Photo Barry Wetcher / AP)Sylvester Stallone? Seriously?Absolutely. Reprising the role that made him famous Stallone turns in an award-worthy performance in the ""Rocky"" reboot ""Creed."" He doesnt overplay things; hes downright humble and lets face it kind of adorable.Not that hes the center of the movie. That would be the estimable Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed Rockys first opponent and ultimate friend. After Apollo dies Adonis ends up in the states care where hes known for causing fights. Eventually hes rescued by Apollos widow (Phylicia Rashad) and brought up in comfort.But comfort doesnt suit Adonis. Hes working his way up the ladder in the business world by day but at night he drives into Mexico to box in lowdown arenas where hes never beaten. Eventually he decides he wants to box full time. Who better to train and teach him than his fathers friend and conqueror Rocky Balboa (Stallone)?So he moves to Philadelphia and finds the aged Rocky running a restaurant completely retired from anything to do with boxing and uninterested in helping some kid train even if he is the son of Apollo Creed.From there the story goes exactly as youd expect Rocky eventually comes around the kid turns out to have talent he train-trains-trains wins an upset victory and then suddenly -- because of his bloodline -- is given a shot at the title going up against the undefeated hothead ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew).Along the way Adonis picks up a partially deaf girlfriend (Tessa Thompson) and struggles with daddy issues. But for the most part ""Creed"" mirrors the first ""Rocky"" which is hardly a bad thing. Writer-director Ryan Coogler who worked with Jordan on ""Fruitvale Station"" is direct and honest in his approach keeping the corn in check. And hes got a secret weapon who brings tons of heart.Stallone? Absolutely.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongCreedGRADE BRated PG-13 for violence language and some sensualityRunning time132 minutes 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1jiF2K0 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/11/24/movie-review-rocky-revitalized-heartfelt-creed/76341136/,200,creed13,creed,detroitnews

Jordan) the son of his old ring rival in ""Creed."" Photo Credit Warner Bros./New Line Cinema / Barry Wetcher advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Rocky Balboa trains the son of his old rival Apollo Creed.CAST Michael B. Jordan Sylvester Stallone Tessa ThompsonRATED (PG-13)LENGTH 212BOTTOM LINE The seventh ""Rocky"" film is uneven but gets by on Jordans charisma and some stunning fight sequences. Philadelphias best-known movie boxer Rocky Balboa returns in ""Creed"" the seventh film in the deathless ""Rocky"" franchise. Its creator and star Sylvester Stallone was throwing punches as recently as 2006s ""Rocky Balboa"" but here the 69-year-old actor has hung up his gloves. ""Creed"" finds him finally playing the trainer not the fighter. In this uneven but mostly entertaining chapter the appealing Michael B. Jordan plays Adonis Johnson a young boxer hiding his identity as the son of late heavyweight legend Apollo Creed (formerly played by Carl Weathers) Rockys great rival and friend. In a poetic twist Adonis wants Rocky to train him. The two must prepare for a fight against United Kingdom champion ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (real-life British boxer Anthony Bellew). advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Creed"" is the Hollywood debut of director Ryan Coogler whose independent drama ""Fruitvale Station"" -- starring Jordan as real-life police shooting victim Oscar Grant III -- created a splash at Sundance in 2013. That movie felt almost like a documentary and Coogler often takes the same approach here. He makes Philadelphia a character nicely capturing its gritty-but-friendly vibe. The scenes between Adonis and a pretty singer named Bianca (Tessa Thompson ""Dear White People"") have a natural easy feel as if Coogler just found them on the street and started filming. Coogler wisely turns on the pyrotechnics for the boxing scenes which range from very good to truly stunning. The films second match in which Adonis squares off against Leo Sporino (Gabriel Rosado a native Philly boxer) is a bruising battle filmed in a single head-spinning take. Its an adrenaline-pumping marvel of filmmaking -- but why does it arrive so early? Nothing afterward ever quite matches it. ""Creed"" suffers from a wobbly script by Coogler and Aaron Covington. Adonis has an odd backstory -- half juvenile delinquent half rich kid -- that doesnt add up. As a foe Conlan is formidable but otherwise uninteresting. Still Stallone settles admirably into his role as the world-weary old trainer; he even eschews the jet-black hair dye hes been using in his ""Expendables"" movies. 243 MoviesCreed trailer ""Creed"" may or may not mark the end of the ""Rocky"" series. But it may signal a future for Coogler an underdog who has made it to the big time.

"Review Creed is a fresh retelling of Rocky that has us in its corner - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Creed is a fresh retelling of Rocky that has us in its corner Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan in Creed Barry Wetcher / Warner Bros. Michael B. Jordan right is Adonis Johnson and Sylvester Stallone is Rocky Balboa in ""Creed."" Michael B. Jordan right is Adonis Johnson and Sylvester Stallone is Rocky Balboa in ""Creed."" (Barry Wetcher / Warner Bros.) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter What becomes a legend most? Ryan Coogler knows.Fresh from ""Fruitvale Station"" his impressive Sundance Grand Jury Prize-winning debut writer-director Coogler presents the very different ""Creed"" a film that is nominally a spinoff of the celebrated ""Rocky"" series but actually plays like something more interesting a spiritual remake of the 1976 film that retells the original story in the kind of involving way one would not have thought possible. Thats because after six previous films made over a period of 30 years a viewer would be forgiven for thinking that this venerated series had fought its final round. Even Rocky Balboas creator and chronicler Sylvester Stallone apparently thought so himself. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The actor who wrote and starred in all six of those movies (and directed four) has admitted he was leery of having the series revived and taking on a new role as aging mentor to up-and-coming fighter Adonis ""Donnie"" Johnson who just happens to be the illegitimate son of Rockys rival turned BFF Apollo Creed. ------------For the record 1140 a.m. Nov. 25 An earlier version of this post said that Stallone wrote directed and starred in all six previous ""Rocky"" films. He directed four. The original and fifth were directed by John G. Avildsen.------------But Coogler who came up with the story and wrote the script with Aaron Covington was persistent and he had several factors on his side. These include a lifelong passion for a series hed shared with his father growing up and a deep familiarity with the details of the previous films that reveals itself in numerous references large and small contained in ""Creed."" Coogler also has a close relationship with Michael B. Jordan the talented star of ""Fruitvale Station"" and a committed athletic actor (""Friday Night Lights"") who trained for nearly a year to look the part of a trim and vigorous boxer and threw himself with equal vigor into the films emotional demands.Cooglers greatest asset however was his own skill as a director his gift for bringing a combination of understated naturalism and involving storytelling to the screen. ""Creed"" rescues the Rocky series from the bombast of the later films and reclaims the overlay of emotion that was its birthright way back when.

Oscar Watch charting the smiles the frowns the ups and downs of the awards season comes to you every Monday from now through the end of February. LIKE MEH DISLIKE Can crowd-pleasing Creed find favor with academy? Thirty-nine years ago ""Rocky"" the rags-to-riches boxing movie that star Sylvester... (Glenn Whipp) This particular story begins in 1998 when a pre-teen Adonis angry that his father died before he was born and his mother abandoned him is fighting everyone he can get his hands on even in a juvenile detention facility. Showing up to rescue him is Mary Ann Creed his fathers widow nicely played by Phylicia Rashad. She adopts Adonis raises him in the Baldwin Hills mansion she shared with Apollo and tries to give him a sense of a world beyond using his fists.But though the adult Adonis has a good job at a Los Angeles financial firm he is still sneaking off to Tijuana on weekends to fight in tiny clubs. Searching for a way to connect with the father he never knew and whose name he resists taking he quits his job and heads to Philadelphia to seek out Rocky Balboa the man whose relationship with Apollo Creed played out in four out of the six films.Rocky of course is not hard to find. A Philadelphia legend he still runs Adrians the memorabilia-filled restaurant named after his late wife still goes out to the cemetery to talk to the graves of Adrian and her brother Paulie and still wears pork pie hats (but not because hes a hipster). Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky Balboa - but this time hes in a fight with mortality Josh Rottenberg Ryan Coogler the director of the new ""Rocky"" spinoff film ""Creed"" wasnt even born when ""Rocky"" came out in 1976. For that matter he wasnt born when ""Rocky II"" ""Rocky III"" or ""Rocky IV"" came out either. Still for as long as he can remember Sylvester Stallones perennial-underdog boxer Rocky... Ryan Coogler the director of the new ""Rocky"" spinoff film ""Creed"" wasnt even born when ""Rocky"" came out in 1976. For that matter he wasnt born when ""Rocky II"" ""Rocky III"" or ""Rocky IV"" came out either. Still for as long as he can remember Sylvester Stallones perennial-underdog boxer Rocky... (Josh Rottenberg) What Rocky older slower and thick around the middle doesnt do anymore is deal with boxing. Convincingly played by Stallone who at this point doesnt act the character so much as simply be him Rocky wearily tells Adonis ""Time takes everybody out. Its undefeated.""But Adonis desperate for the formal ring training hes never had is not so easily put off. He goes to work out at Rockys former home base Mighty Micks Boxing Gym where the guys call him Hollywood and the top dog is ranked light heavyweight Leo ""The Lion"" Sporino (real-life boxer Gabriel Rosado).Also taking up Adonis time is Bianca (Tessa Thompson) the aspiring singer he meets cute in his apartment building when he rousts her for playing music too loud. They even go out together for cheesesteaks which is about as Philly romantic as you can get.Before you know it (there wouldnt be any movie if he didnt) Rocky is helping Adonis out cluing him in to old-school training methods like chasing chickens to increase your speed and doing lots and lots of roadwork. Rocky also does not stint on the homilies one of his favorites being ""one step at a time one punch at a time one round at a time."" Hard to argue with that one. Getting the Rocky spinoff Creed made was a real underdog story for director Ryan Coogler Josh Rottenberg Ryan Coogler the director of the new ""Rocky"" spinoff film ""Creed"" wasnt even born when ""Rocky"" came out in 1976. For that matter he wasnt born when ""Rocky II"" ""Rocky III"" or ""Rocky IV"" came out either. Still for as long as he can remember Sylvester Stallones perennial-underdog boxer Rocky... Ryan Coogler the director of the new ""Rocky"" spinoff film ""Creed"" wasnt even born when ""Rocky"" came out in 1976. For that matter he wasnt born when ""Rocky II"" ""Rocky III"" or ""Rocky IV"" came out either. Still for as long as he can remember Sylvester Stallones perennial-underdog boxer Rocky... (Josh Rottenberg) Just as Apollo Creed loomed on the horizon in the original film after Rockys fight with Spider Rico yet another champion Britains ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (Anthony Bellew another real fighter) hovers menacingly in the distance.But first Adonis and Rocky have stuff to resolve including areas involving Rockys personal situation and those having to do with Adonis issues about abandonment and reconnection.When it finally comes down to what happens in the ring ""Creed"" knows what its doing. Director of photography Maryse Alberti (""The Wrestler"") is expert at bringing the action alive even photographing one fight in a single two-minute Steadicam shot and real-life ring habitues such as Ricardo ""Padman"" McGill and Jacob ""Stitch"" Duran add an air of authenticity to Adonis entourage.Within the inevitable boundaries of a venerable franchise (this is a ""Rocky"" film after all) Coogler and company do fine work convincing us against our better judgment that nothing we see is preordained that anything can happen within the four corners of the ring. You cant ask a ""Rocky"" film to do more than that.kenneth.turanlatimes.com-----------CreedMPAA rating PG-13 for violence language and some sensualityRunning time 2 hours 12 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on November 25 2015 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""A knockout - `Creed offers a fresh take on the `Rocky tale - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Entertainment Movies Ryan Coogler Reviews Sylvester Stallone Fruitvale Station Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-creed-review-20151125-column.html,200,creed15,creed,latimes

By Michael OSullivan November 24 2015 Sylvester Stallone reprises his role as Rocky Balboa in ""Creed"" when Apollo Creeds son (Michael B. Jordan) travels to Philadelphia so Balboa can train him in boxing. (  / Warner Bros.) One of the instincts you develop in the job of a critic is defense. The ability to guard against the jabs of cheap sentiment is essential if one wants to stay in the match -- or to at least know what hit him. And so it is with some surprise that I admit to being fairly knocked out by ""Creed"" a movie that is not just about boxing which I have never cared about but also is a sequel to the ""Rocky"" franchise which I pretty much gave up on 25 years ago roundabout ""Rocky V."" [The Holiday Movie Guide 12 films matched to every taste] This latest addition to the tale of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) who comes out of retirement to mentor the talented but inexperienced son (Michael B. Jordan) of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is a touching affectionate and undeniably thrilling continuation of the almost 40-year-old saga. To paraphrase Muhammad Ali the real-life inspiration for the character of Apollo ""Creed"" floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. In some ways its not really a ""Rocky"" movie at all; its the first of the series not written by Stallone. In other ways its quintessentially one. Centering on Jordans ""Donny"" (for Adonis) Johnson the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed (who died in the ring at the hands of Soviet fighter Ivan Drago in ""Rocky IV"") ""Creed"" relegates Stallones Rocky to a supporting yet still key role that of the gray eminence represented by Burgess Meredith as Rockys trainer Mickey in the early films. Here Rocky takes on the role of the pugilistic seer a punch-drunk Yoda given to uttering such pearls of wisdom as ""One step one punch"" as he squints at his young protege. Jordan is the star not Stallone. In ""Creed"" Rocky Balboa (Stallone) makes a return to the ring as a mentor to Adonis Johnson (Jordan) center the son of his late friend and boxer Apollo Creed. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) And yet Donny who struggles with his temper -- a coping mechanism that helps him deal with the fear of not living up to the name Creed which he has yet to embrace -- is every bit a worthy successor to Rocky. Having won only small fights in Mexico before moving from Los Angeles to Philadelphia where he seeks Rockys help Donny is the classic underdog. Yet after his first pro bout in Philly it comes out that hes a Creed. Before he knows it Donny has been challenged to a match by the light heavyweight world champion (played by professional boxer Tony Bellew from Liverpool). Of course its on account of Donnys genes not his talent. The fighter must get into shape courtesy of Rocky who uses some of the same tricks (chasing chickens) that were used on him way back when. Thats the skeleton on which the meat of this story hangs. There are some viscerally powerful boxing scenes but ultimately the flesh of ""Creed"" has almost as much to do with relationships as it does with the sweet science. Both the friendship between Donny and Rocky whom the young man endearingly calls ""Unc"" and the shyly sweet romance that Donny embarks on with Bianca (Tessa Thompson) an aspiring musician who lives below him are finely etched. The connections feel real and complicated. Director and co-writer Ryan Coogler who worked with Jordan on the excellent ""Fruitvale Station"" knows how to get the most out of his star whose performance in ""Creed"" is rich and rewarding enough to wash the taste of ""Fantastic Four"" out of the mouth. The city of Philly is like a main character too. Evoking a sense of place that goes deeper than shots of the William Penn statue atop City Hall Coogler evinces an affection for the City of Brotherly Love that feels both genuine and knowing. Scenes shot at Maxs Steaks Johnny Brendas and the Electric Factory add texture as does a simultaneously amusing and stirring sequence featuring several of North Phillys infamous dirt bike riders popping wheelies alongside Donny as he jogs -- clad in a more stylish version of Rockys iconic sweats -- through the streets. ""Creed"" is not melodrama-free. A subplot involving Rockys health hinted at in one of the films trailers feels tired and thin. Yet the themes of love loyalty ambition honor and legacy that lend sinew to the story are delivered with such a clean punch that they as feel as fresh as they did in 1976. PG-13. At area theaters.

"Creed Ryan Cooglers Rocky update starring Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone reviewed (VIDEO). Slate Sign In Sign Up Ryan Cooglers Creed Is a Master Class in the Art of Inspirational Sports Montages Ryan Cooglers Creed Is a Master Class in the Art of Inspirational Sports Montages Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 24 2015 426 PM Creed Is Good Ryan Cooglers installment in the Rocky franchise is an invigorating crowd-pleaser. By Aisha Harris Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone in Creed. Photo by Barry Wetcher. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Inc. It was weird news a couple of years ago to learn that Ryan Coogler would helm a Rocky spin-off focusing on the son of Apollo Creed. Coogler made a name for himself with his impressive feature debut Fruitvale Station a self-assured meditation on the last day in the life of a black man in America--why would he want to follow such a provocative sobering film by contributing a generic sports drama to an aging battered franchise? I was intrigued to see Coogler reuniting so quickly with his Fruitvale Station star the promising Michael B. Jordan but it was hard not to feel as though they both deserved better material. Aisha Harris Aisha Harris is a Slate staff writer. Cue montage (Coogler writing furiously Jordan training both of them on set.) Cut to the present day Some of Cooglers (white) peers have jumped just as quickly from the indie scene to multi-million dollar franchises even bigger than the Rocky series; one of them Josh Trank directed last summers most notorious flop Fantastic Four--also starring Jordan. We dont need another Rocky any more than we needed another reboot of a superhero franchise. But if weve got to have more Rocky why not involve two of Hollywoods most likable rising stars of color? And maybe just maybe Coogler--who co-wrote the film alongside Aaron Covington--could find a way to reinvigorate the genre. Advertisement Creed begins in 1998 when Adonis Creed is an adolescent in juvie with a natural talent for taking on kids twice his size. One day a woman (Phylicia Rashad) comes to visit him revealing that she was married to his late father--the boxer once played by Carl Weathers who defeated the hero in 1976s Rocky and later befriended Balboa--and wants to take him in. By the present day Adonis (Jordan) when not working a nondescript finance job in L.A. is winning amateur boxing matches in Mexico under the last name Johnson. (Throughout the film he refuses to tout that he is Apollos son insisting that he make it on his own.) Upon receiving a promotion he promptly quits to pursue boxing full-time and moves to Philadelphia to seek out the guidance of legendary Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). Rocky is hesitant at first but Adonis eventually wears him down convincing him to help him train to take on the undefeated champion of the world British fighter ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (real-life pro Tony Bellew). All of the bones of the inspirational sports drama are present The scrappy upstart with unwavering determination and a whole lotta heart; the fading legend who long ago resigned himself to old age and loneliness; the mouthy champion who is the Goliath to the scrappy upstarts David. Indeed switch out Stallones iconic character in Rocky for Adonis and youve essentially got Creed. (There are tons of callbacks to the franchise for die-hard fans including a chicken chase.) But its also clear that Coogler and Covington work hard to break through the cliches and make the boxing movie a little more interesting. Take the character of Bianca played by Tessa Thompson (Dear White People). Because no tale of a would-be champion is ever complete without a love interest Creed supplies Adonis Philly apartment with a gorgeous neighbor. But Bianca is revealed to be very much her own person with her own colorful background and career as a local musician. Of course by the end of the film she fills that supportive girlfriend-on-the-sidelines role but shes a far cry from Talia Shires meek and insecure Adrian in the first film. Where Creed TKOs most other sports dramas though is in Cooglers direction Maryse Albertis cinematography (she also did The Wrestler) and the editing of Claudia Castello and Michael P. Shawver. My god the training montages Anyone making a Rocky movie in 2015 must grapple with this requirement the series having made such montages both iconic and cliched. Creeds montages (and I counted no less than three) are masterfully crafted each one building upon the last. They provide the perfect melding of music (a combination of hip-hop bravado and swelling movie orchestration) rejuvenating imagery of an impeccably sculpted body at work and no shortage of emotional investment thanks to the truly galvanizing filial dynamic between Stallone and Jordan. In these montages Coogler goes big and the results are nothing short of inspiring--and I write this as someone who rolls her eyes at the tropes of sports dramas. I feared signing on to Creed might derail Cooglers and Jordans careers. Instead this revitalizing crowd-pleaser solidifies my belief that these two have the potential to create really great art. I still hope this ambitious and talented director returns to original storytelling sooner rather than later but if he decides hes next going to remake say Saturday Night Fever? I wont be so quick to judge. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2. Is it a Pokemon or a Cholesterol Medication?

Updated July 30 2016  1053 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Review Creed has plenty of punch By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Nov 24 2015 (...) Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) has been a fighter since long before he stepped into the ring. Behind his easy smile is an anger he cant always control - an anger that has been there since he was a child.He not only likes to box but has to and it helps that hes good at it. But then he should be. His father was Apollo Creed whose fights with Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) have gone down in boxing history as legendary.Even though embracing his fathers legacy would be a significant advantage Adonis is determined to make it on his own. But he also realizes that he needs a trainer who can take him to the next level. And as much as he might hate to admit it he knows who that trainer is Balboa.The Italian Stallion hasnt been near his old gym in years and isnt exactly eager to take Adonis on. What hes not prepared for is just how insistent the young fighter can be.Also in Adonis corner is Bianca (Tessa Thompson) a singer whos struggling with her own challenges. With their help Adonis Johnson gets his shot at glory. But does he have what it takes to be Adonis Creed?Whether viewed as a spinoff or as a sequel ""Creed"" is a thrilling addition to the ""Rocky"" saga -- and another triumph for Jordan and director Ryan Coogler who last teamed up on the breakout 2013 indie flick ""Fruitvale Station."" Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Aaron Covington Coogler delivers a boxing movie for the millennial generation. In a performance that should help his fans forget ""Fantastic Four"" Jordan is flat-out terrific. Stallone brings to his familiar role as Rocky a nuanced vulnerability. And Thompson makes a strong impression as a woman who is every bit Adonis equal.Often extending a movie franchise signifies a lack of imagination. But ""Creed"" is a knockout.What ""Creed""  Four stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Content Violence language sensuality  Run time 209  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Movies 7 holiday films getting major attention Nov 17 2015 (...)

Jordan in Creed Photo by Barry Wetcher A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The heads of the City Dionysia the Grecian playwriting competition that pitted Aeschylus against Sophocles and can be considered the original Oscars had a rule no original characters. Instead the best creative minds of a generation -- or really a millennium -- exhausted themselves finding new spins on say Medea. When Euripides rebooted the child-murderess as an empathetic immigrant audiences were so scandalized that they voted him last place. Formula trumped freshness. Sitting in a movie theater 2500 years later watching men named Apollo and Adonis pummel opponents like the first Olympic boxers the past has never felt more present.Ryan Cooglers Creed is set in Philadelphia the Mount Olympus of movie boxing where Adonis ""Hollywood"" Johnson illegitimate son of Apollo Creed pilgrimages to learn footwork from that legendary oracle Rocky Balboa played as ever by Sylvester Stallone who launched the series in 1976 as an underdog actor-writer. Back then Stallone was obsessed with creating his own mythology He was the stubborn visionary who had only 106 in the bank when he turned down a six-figure deal to give the lead in Rocky to Burt Reynolds. Now supposedly hes here to pass the gloves to rising talent Michael B. Jordan and become his Burgess Meredith-like mentor. Film Details Creed RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time132 min. More Info Trailer But after seven rounds as the Italian Stallion Stallone cant let go of the spotlight -- even though he barely has a handle on his own character. His Balboa has been Xeroxed too many times; hes all blurry around the edges. The once hyper-specific lug who doted on turtles still has the fedora and clear plastic glasses -- he even still has the turtles -- but now comes across like a generic old man who reads the newspaper complains about his back and is befuddled by technology. When Adonis uploads his jump-rope routine to the cloud Rocky is mystified. ""What cloud?"" he grunts looking at the sky a joke that could pop up in any movie about any retiree (and probably will).Rocky also clearly doesnt have Facebook because hes astonished to learn that Apollo Creed had a child even though Creeds widow Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) adopted Adonis his secret son out of foster care in 1998 and raised him in his dads mansion. Adonis goes by his estranged birth mothers name Johnson but hes hungry for a new family. The kid calls Rocky ""uncle"" and though theyre near-strangers the term fits. Even to us Rocky is just a vague figure who shows up every decade or so around the holidays.The movie around him is just as vague. After his 15th win at a slum club in Tijuana where his opponents are so rinky-dink that he unties his gloves before the referee counts to siete Adonis quits a vague white-collar job (insurance? banking? law?) to go pro. Why? prods Mary Anne. Hes rich not desperate or dumb. Adonis cant answer and neither can the film which vacillates between believing he needs to prove himself as an individual and framing boxing as an inheritable disease. (At night Adonis projects YouTube videos of his fathers fights on the wall and boxes the man he never met.) Related StoriesHow Robert Teppers ""No Easy Way Out"" Became a Rocky Soundtrack ClassicThe script squeezes in three other father-son fighter pairs -- despite the existence of Laila Ali the only daughters are female extras sweating in the back of the gym a slight progression from the 70s. Yet when Adonis turns to these men for training they refuse because his daddy died. Is death-by-Dolph Lundgren genetic? EXPAND Michael B. Jordan as Adonis ""Hollywood"" Johnson in the ring Photo by Barry Wetcher Creed exists in a shadow world of deja vu. Adonis visits the Rocky statue wears familiar gray sweats and prods Uncle Balboa about the fight from Rocky III almost as if hes a fan of the films. He sleeps next to Paulies old porn magazines and as in Rocky IV preps to fight an international bad boy on foreign soil. With the scripts emphasis on dynasty it makes sense the villain ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew) is English. Yet as the provenance of an evocative rival Liverpool is no Cold War Moscow though Coogler does his best to amplify stereotypes. Conlan and his manager scheme in front of parlor fireplaces and host the press conference in a palace that Adonis gasps at It looks like an art museum. (Which makes you wonder -- after all those years running up the Philadelphia Museum of Art steps did Rocky ever go inside?)When Stallone wrote Rocky he wasnt a boxing fan. Original director John G. Avildsen hated the sport. Accordingly Rocky was a boxing movie that was about everything but opportunity loserdom loneliness. Creed is just a boxing movie. Adonis gets the same character beats -- a romance with a Medusa-haired siren (Tessa Thompson) a too-soon big fight his own fading mentor three workout montages -- but the film itself is just a drumroll for a young warrior who only wants to win. The interesting wrinkles in the Adonis character go mostly unexplored like his abusive early childhood and torn feelings about his cheating father. Even his rich-kid background which matters so much to everyone else barely registers once Adonis moves to Philly to slum it. He unpacks his Nike collection in a cheap studio and instantly blends in with the hood. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Creed wants all of the Rocky drama but invests in none of the smarts. Rocky told us that the biggest fight was a man against himself -- and the movie meant it. Here the characters have silly personal fights more pointless than the ones in the ring. Even the boxing matches are easily distracted. Coogler likes to use swirling single takes which feel visceral and frightening -- Creeds battle against Leo ""The Lion"" Sporino (Gabe Rosado) is a literal knockout -- but missteps by keeping the camera so close we often cant even see the fighters fists. Hed rather pan over to look at blood spatters ice buckets bikini girls anywhere but the ring.Meanwhile 69-year-old Stallone pulls focus in the background coughing dramatically like a Victorian heroine. If Rockys own mentor Mickey was sick the old salt would crawl off like a sick cat. But Stallone has always and will always loom over his franchise. When Adonis seizes a moment to seduce Thompsons Bianca on Rockys couch the camera pans over to end the scene on Balboas disapproving turtle. Its the kind of goofy personal choice the film could use more of but it also made me shiver. Even Rockys pets will outlive us all.CREED | Directed by Ryan Coogler | Written by Coogler and Aaron Covington | Warner Bros. | CitywideCorrection An earlier version of this story misidentified Laila Ali.

Jordan and Sylvester Stallone star in Creed. Warner Bros. PicturesIn an upset victory director and co-writer Ryan Coogler brings something new to the Rocky franchise. Michael B. Jordan is terrific as Apollo Creeds son and Sylvester Stallone is understated.Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver solid performances in ""Creed.""(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 stars out of 5Stallone has not been this good in a Rocky movie since the first oneJordan is a worthy heir to the franchise mantle if they go in that directionThey were smart to call ""Creed"" what they did because really would anyone have wanted to see ""Rocky 7?""Wait dont answer that. Sylvester Stallones character has gone from iconic to moronic over the years and the sequels. But there is still a lot of love for the ol tomato can from the 1976 original (which is actually pretty great and won an Oscar for best picture). ""Creed"" knows this. In fact director and co-writer Ryan Coogler is counting on it.He uses Stallones most famous character and the audiences relationship with him to full advantage in the new film while allowing Rocky to go back to being what he was at the beginning A hard-working lump willing to sacrifice enough to get what he wants.In theory ""Creed"" isnt even about Rocky. Its about Adonis (Michael B. Jordan working again with his ""Fruitvale Station"" director) the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed Rockys greatest rival and eventual friend. Adonis wants to carve his own path. Hes an angry kid who fights because he feels like he has to who isnt above chasing chickens around a yard to get quicker who gets a shot at the champ by fluke who finds the love of a strong independent woman.AZCENTRALMichael B. Jordan goes toe-to-toe in CreedSounds familiar?If the plot of ""Creed"" echoes the original ""Rocky"" at least its echoing something worthwhile. But there are differences. The film begins with Adonis as a boy living in juvenile detention when not in foster homes. Hes always in trouble for fighting. A visit from Mary Ann Creed (Phylicia Rashad) Apollos widow changes his life in an instant Soon hes living in a mansion in Los Angeles instead of on the streets or in foster homes.But still he fights only now inside the ring. He has a lot of promise but hes self-taught traveling from his job as a financial consultant to Mexico on the weekends for matches (hes undefeated).Michael B. Jordan is a worthy heir to the ""Rocky"" franchise star title. (Photo Warner Bros.)Adonis knows its not enough. He refuses to trade on his late fathers name (Apollo died in the ring you may recall) but is drawn to his past. So he packs up and moves to Philadelphia where he seeks the services of a man he has never met to get him into real fighting shape Rocky Balboa. Adonis refuses to acknowledge his lineage at first. But Rocky despite a blow or two too many to the head is no dummy when it comes to fighters.But hes also done with the game. He runs a restaurant and visits the cemetery plodding along in life while inhabiting a character that is the antithesis of the musclebound meathead of the later ""Rocky"" films (and ""The Expendables""). He has lived a good life and he knows it and he has no desire to go back to the old days.Except ... Apollos son is practically family (he calls Rocky ""Unc""). Lets assume youve seen an inspirational sports movie so you can guess what happens at this point without considering it a spoiler Yes Rocky goes back into the gym (where hes still called ""Champ"" by everyone) and trains Adonis. And yes he takes him out back and has him chase chickens as Rocky himself did in the original. He works him on the speed bag but does not thankfully wake him up with a cocktail of raw eggs the way Rocky used to start his day.AZCENTRALCreed (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsMeanwhile Adonis gets to know Bianca (Tessa Thompson) a singer who lives in the apartment below his. She is a nice addition to the story; she has her own struggles as Adonis will learn and is not in the mood to cater to anyones whims or moods. But they hit it off and then dont and then do etc. You know the drill.This makes it sound rote. Its not. Jordan is outstanding in a slow-burn role. He saves his explosions for the ring and more quietly a final acknowledgement that is both stunning and obvious but you dont realize its the latter until he has said it. His final epic match against champ ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (real-life fighter Tony Bellew) who is on his way to prison hits all the right notes and in its way brings the story full circle.Which means probably a sequel. But once youve seen the work Stallone and Jordan do in ""Creed"" the idea of a ""Rocky 8"" doesnt sound so bad.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Creed confidently steps into Rockys ring review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCreed confidently steps into Rockys ring reviewWriter-director Ryan Coogler successfully retools the Rocky franchise for a new generation keeping all of the heart of the original.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterTues. Nov. 24 2015CreedStarring Michael B. Jordan Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson. Directed by Ryan Coogler. 129 minutes. Opening Nov. 25 at major theatres. 14ACreed enters the ring feeling a lot like Rocky. It even sounds like Rocky with Sylvester Stallone as the one-time champ still the punching-bag philosopher in his winter years.Yet writer-director Ryan Coogler so impressive with his Fruitvale Station debut successfully spins the table to refresh the 39-year-old franchise. He keeps all the heart of the original in introducing the classic story of an underdogs quest for glory to a new generation through Adonis Johnson (Fruitvale star Michael B. Jordan) son of Rockys one-time ring rival-turned friend Apollo Creed.Article Continued BelowJordan is a convincing mix of streetwise bravado and jittery insecurity as the son of a famous fighter who balks at living in his fathers shadow. Jordan has worked hard looking every inch a credibly powerful boxer. But his Adonis is also flawed his swagger nudged by self-doubt later evidenced in an almost-comic pre-fight attack of nerves.Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan star in Creed the latest Rocky movie.  (Barry Wetcher / Warner Bros Pictures)  Working from his screenplay co-written with newcomer Aaron Covington Coogler wisely keeps the dramatic bones of the 1976 multiple Oscar-winning original while scenes of Philadelphia street culture dirt bike riders a hip-hop soundtrack and even the citys heralded cheese steaks make Creed feel immediate. Yet hes not afraid to be sentimental. Hey even tough guys get choked up.Adonis whose mother was pregnant when Apollo died (in the ring in Rocky IV) first appears as a troubled California kid whose quick fists repeatedly land him in detention. Apollos widow Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) swallows her pride to bring the kid home to live in the Creed mansion. In adulthood Adonis is happiest as a winning if untrained fighter in Tijuana. Hes got no time for the father he never knew. ""Nothin to do with me"" he says with a shrug. He isnt shy about using the Apollo card to get to Rocky. The creaky ex-champ is working at his late wifes namesake restaurant in Philly when Adonis turns up guilting him into being his trainer.And bonus Rocky shares the outcome of that private third bout with Apollo that closed Rocky III.As for Adoniss love interest shes no shy pet store clerk this time out. Selmas Tessa Thompson portrays Bianca as a confident woman with an eye on her singing career. Pity her character is only sketched out a casualty of the male-dominated storyline.Now-familiar Rocky training montages -- yes Adonis chases a frantic chicken around and there are a few teasing bars of Bill Contis Rocky theme song -- lead to fights that look close to real. Actual boxers including Brit Tony Bellew as ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan and tight camerawork from French cinematographer Maryse Alberti (The Wrestler) complete the screen illusion.All eyes are on Jordan and rightly so but Stallone also earns his place reprising the downbeat lovable lug from Rocky Balboa who struggled to get past emotional and physical blocks for one last shot at a title. The years pass. That Rocky is gone. Coogler crafts a perfect touching way to acknowledge that at the conclusion of Creed.

Jordan and Ryan Coogler Sylvester Stallone potentially leaks Creed spoiler online Rocky star Tony Burton dies Sylvester Stallones Oscar loss Hollywood bulls--- brother Creed is not just a knockout boxing movie it coaxes Rocky Balboa off the mat and revives an iconic American hero. It does this remarkable deed by paying homage to the original Rocky movie from 1976 as well as the early sequels. This is the era before creator and star Sylvester Stallone TKOed his own franchise with the ridiculous Rocky IV and Rocky V (although he did try to right some of his own wrongs with the personalized 2006 drama Rocky Balboa). The new movie acknowledges that four decades have passed since Balboa first showed his grit in the ring. There is natural character development here along with a fresh thoughtful youthful story that positions Balboa as a ragged lion in the winter of his life. Creed never exploits or makes a mockery of what is best about the Rocky franchise -- its inspirational qualities and its love and respect for the relentless underdog. Credit goes to California writer-director Ryan Coogler known for his racially charged drama Fruitvale Station. Coogler wrote Creed as a tribute to his own father an Oakland probation officer who took his own inspiration from the Rocky series and gifted his filmmaker son with the same passion. The 29-year-old Coogler helped to persuade the now 69-year-old Stallone to reprise his most iconic role one last time -- and to serve as a co-producer. This time around -- in the only Rocky movie that was not officially written by Stallone -- Rocky Balboa is nudged out of his melancholic retirement to train the late Apollo Creeds illegitimate son Adonis Johnson Creed. This conflicted young man (who is played by the excellent young actor from Fruitvale Station Michael B. Jordan) never knew his father yet he is obsessed with a deep-seated need to excel as a light heavyweight boxer himself. Jordans character finds Rocky puttering around his modest Italian restaurant Adrians in Philadelphia. After much to-and-fro because Rocky is reluctant Adonis Creed finally persuades the older man to get in his corner. And Rocky gets into Adonis face too both literally and figuratively. Much of the movie is an echo of the original Rocky movie even though Adonis background and upbringing are radically different from the hardscrabble origins of Balboa. Yet some of the movie is a reminder that 40 years have passed since Stallones Rocky. Coogler juices Creed with some hip hop street culture of present-day Philly The convoy parade of dirt bikes accompanying Jordan as he trains is both amusing and insightful. In taking on both the old and the new Coogler shows his own respect for the past without making Creed into a dusty old relic. The screenplay which Coogler co-wrote with Aaron Covington (along with uncredited contributions from Stallone) puts Jordans Adonis Creed into the ring in Mexico in Philadelphia and finally in London where he fights an epic battle with a tough Brit boxer (Tony Bellew) who is both a criminal and a world champion. Key support players are played by Tessa Thompson a musician who becomes Adonis Adrian and Phylicia Rashad who is the selfless woman who raises Adonis to manhood after he is abandoned and heading into a life of crime. Notably Thompsons character has a feisty independence that Adrian was never allowed. The heart and soul of Creed of course is the interplay between Jordan and Stallone. The younger actor is as physically fit as Stallone was in the first Rocky and he brings the same intensity to the emotional side of Adonis. The older actor is a revelation - and a possible Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actor. Stallone has several showcase scenes each of them modest yet powerful and profound. None more so than when he filmed alone reading his newspaper while sitting next to the graves of Adrian and Paulie. Later in the movie when his character faces a physical crisis Stallone is also understated and convincing. Meanwhile for all its hard drama and soft humour Creed is a boxing movie. On that scorecard Coogler also has a knockout. Punch after punch every ring scene is absolutely realistic. Twitter Bruce_Kirkland bruce.kirklandsunmedia.ca Sponsored Links See All Sponsored Links Review Creed review Sylvester Stallone scores a KO in Rockys last stand By Bruce Kirkland Postmedia Network First posted Tuesday November 24 2015 1118 AM EST | Updated Tuesday November 24 2015 1137 AM EST Creed is not just a knockout boxing movie it coaxes Rocky Balboa off the mat and revives an iconic American hero. It does this remarkable deed by paying homage to the original Rocky movie from 1976 as well as the early sequels. This is the era before creator and star Sylvester Stallone TKOed his own franchise with the ridiculous Rocky IV and Rocky V (although he did try to right some of his own wrongs with the personalized 2006 drama Rocky Balboa). The new movie acknowledges that four decades have passed since Balboa first showed his grit in the ring. There is natural character development here along with a fresh thoughtful youthful story that positions Balboa as a ragged lion in the winter of his life. Creed never exploits or makes a mockery of what is best about the Rocky franchise -- its inspirational qualities and its love and respect for the relentless underdog.

Close Join the conversation... On Twitter With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh A hungry young man shadow boxes in a cinder block basement in Tijuana preparing for a fight. In the next scene the same man wears a suit and tie behind a shiny desk in Los Angeles. Who is this guy? Is this really another Rocky movie?Yes it is and it remains unpredictable and alive even as it trades in the pugilistic clichA(c)s that saturate just about every boxing drama. Creed is the happiest surprise of the movie season a mix of old and new that taps our reservoir of nostalgia and forges a path of its own. It serves comfort food with fresh ingredients.That young man is Adonis Johnson born after his father Apollo Creed was killed in the ring (see Rocky IV a far inferior movie for all the gory details). Adonis grew up using his fists in group homes before Apollos widow (Phylicia Rashad) took him in and raised him for a white collar life. As played by Michael B. Jordan washing off the stench of Fantastic Four with an alert and impassioned performance Adonis lives caught between two worlds. But only one of them gets his blood pumping.When Adonis watches video of his dad fighting Rocky he stands in front of the screen and whales away in unison -- on his dad. Anger and abandonment fuel his fire. He could use a father figure. He could also use a trainer. You can see where this is going but you cant predict how much intelligence and redemption go into the execution. This would be a good time for a few words on Sylvester Stallone. I always felt he had the pathos to become a strong character actor if he hadnt gone the gilded path of action heroics. Hes shown those chops before most notably in the undervalued Cop Land and he quietly embraces them here. Also outstanding Tessa Thompson as Adonis multi-layered love interest. (A Hollywood movie with complex black and female characters? Stop the presses and ring the bell.)Rocky is now an aging conflicted restaurateur not necessarily full of regrets but certainly plagued by them. We see him visit the cemetery where his loved ones are buried -- he leaves a pint of whiskey for Paulie -- and sit to read the paper with some contentment in his eyes. But theres also an itch there. Rocky needs a renewed purpose and this peripheral figure from his past his old friend and combatants son is the one to provide it.The director/co-writer is Ryan Coogler who worked with Jordan on the excellent but modestly sized Fruitvale Station. Creed offers the pleasure of showing what he can do with a big canvas and a few bucks. The movies peaks in the ring and out reach operatic heights. Coogler even breathes new life into the training montage and street scenes which enlist the city of Philadelphia as a character to an extent not seen in this series since the very first Rocky movie back in 1976.Among the many musical highlights is the song accompanying the aforementioned training montage ""Bridging the Gap."" Its a bluesy rap performed by Nas and his father Olu Dara. The title the sound (featuring a killer Muddy Waters sample) and the sentiment make for a perfect emblem of the film. Coogler Jordan and Stallone are bridging a gap here between then and now and between generations and cultures; young hip-hop heads and old-school Rocky  fans should delight in Creed. It will strike a cross-demographic gold mine and make a lot of money. Of course it doesnt hurt that its a really good movie.Creed (A-)Directed by Ryan Coogler.

Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad left) adopts her late husbands son Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) after some early years in a state orphanage. Photo Barry Wetcher Associated Press Creed a moving return to the Rocky saga 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Sylvester Stallone didnt write or direct ""Creed"" and hes not even the star of it but hes the one people will be talking about for days afterward. His portrayal of Rocky Balboa as an old tired man who has been beaten into some true wisdom is heartfelt but in no way corny. The performance is the apotheosis of everything Stallone has meant to people in almost 40 years onscreen. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler ""Creed"" revitalizes the ""Rocky"" franchise but doesnt transform it. Coogler doesnt mess with what audiences already like but gives the series a transfusion of energy that lifts it in the 21st century. This is possible only because in an industry not known for self-effacement Stallone and Coogler each found a way to do something selfless. Stallone let go of his baby and let another man run with it. And Coogler riding a wave of success following his debut (""Fruitvale Station"") put his creativity in the service of another artists characters. Stallone doesnt show up until about 20 minutes into the film. First we meet Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) who spent years in a state orphanage getting into fights -- fighting is in his genes -- before being adopted by the widow of his father Apollo Creed. For those not up on their ""Rocky"" lore Apollo was the heavyweight champ and rival of Rockys who was eventually killed in the ring by an evil Soviet boxer. Adonis was born after his father had already died. After some hard years in the orphanage Adonis grows up in wealth and luxury but with a nagging desire to prove himself to the phantom father figure. Soon he quits his white-collar job and flies out to Philadelphia hoping to persuade Apollos old friend and rival Rocky Balboa to train him. But Rocky looks frail and has lost interest in the present. In between running his restaurant he spends a lot of time in the cemetery reading the newspaper to the tombstones of his wife and best friend. With a movie like this the idea is half the game Rocky trains Apollo Creeds son. Now thats a great movie idea. Given that concept probably half the people reading this could devise within five minutes a scenario very close to that of this film. But success or failure is all in the execution and all in the details. Rockys path to becoming Adonis trainer is not immediate and its made interesting. Adonis forms a connection with a young woman in his building an aspiring singer-songwriter (Tessa Thompson) trying to make her mark before advancing deafness overtakes her. Coogler doesnt just give us a frame for Rocky but a world to inhabit filled with vivid people whom were made to care about. In terms of filming Coogler announces himself an effective innovator in one of the first fight scenes. Instead of giving us a boxing match in the time-honored tradition of Stallone and Scorsese -- lots of quick cuts -- he films rounds in single long takes moving the camera along with Adonis so that there is no letup in the audiences feeling of threat and anxiety. And then just as wisely Coogler shows us he wont be wedded to technique. In the very next fight he drops that approach entirely and goes for the kinetic quick-editing approach which he does as well as anybody. Yet Coogler knows what Stallone has always known Its not about the fights. Its about making an audience feel deeply about the people involved in the fights. Adonis is a young man who has grown up with everything except the approval of a father a towering figure who never knew him. Adonis has no idea who he is in relation to that shadow. And then theres Rocky whose wife is dead whose best friends are dead whose career is behind him and whose kids are out of the picture. All concerned could use a little family about now. Actually by now were practically in the family too. Stallone benefits and deserves to benefit from the audiences long association with him and the character. Rocky might not be the brightest guy but he knows things. He has his limitations but he is in his own way extraordinary and when we look at his/Stallones face we can have no doubt that Rocky has gone through life and learned things. He has been awake all these years and growing. With no exaggeration this is a beautiful and moving thing to see. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson in ""Creed."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint When a film follows a path far different from its trailers it can be a bait and switch shill or a blessing. I cant express how relieved I was to see that ""Rocky 7"" or as it is officially titled ""Creed"" is not the film that the marketing department promised us. Unlike the brutal boxing melodrama that the previews pledged this excellent sequel introduces new characters to the series while paying homage to the enduring appeal of its predecessors. ""Creed"" follows the themes and gambits of classic fight films but this is no paint-by-numbers imitation. It unabashedly manipulates audiences without guile jerks tears piles on hardships and smooths out conflicts on its way to a wholesome uplifting finale. It is cornball as all get out formulaic and wonderfully amazingly delicious. The plot is basic. A journeyman boxer who grew up in cruddy state facilities wants to climb up the ranks to the top of the professional totem pole. On his way to the championship he must learn how to protect his fragile soul. If you saw Jake Gyllenhaal being beaten to ground chuck in Antoine Fuquas grim ""Southpaw"" last summer this may feel familiar. The prologue showing the hard-knocks life of brawling preteen Adonis Johnson Creed suggests he might have the menace of a Clubber Lang. Luckily things quickly get better. The out-of-wedlock essentially abandoned child of the late champ Apollo Creed Adonis grows up shadow boxing to share his iconic fathers limelight. Michael B. Jordan (as compelling here as he was in director Ryan Cooglers previous film ""Fruitvale Station"") infuses considerable depth to the essentially likable character. Adonis has a combative hair trigger but hes conflicted about fighting at times reluctant to commit to the sport that killed his dad. Who could be a better mentor than Rocky Balboa the patron saint of Philadelphia? At 69 Sylvester Stallone returns to his archetypal role in a touching deeply felt performance. Hes no longer the main character but definitely a main character. Well into retirement years the Italian Stallion has the adorable hangdog demeanor of an aged pet bulldog. Pro boxing is no country for old he-men but Rocky is the ideal sidekick for Adonis in this mismatched buddy picture. Adonis convinces Rocky to guide him toward a championship bout and introduces him to everyone as his uncle. Never a great actor Stallone is a good and hugely appealing one getting by more on an affable regular guy persona than talent. As he has in earlier films Stallone treats Rocky as a sweet lumbering sad sack. His shy smiles sad eyes shambling walk and soft diction imply the physical impact of aging. Its a sly performance pushing away the tough guy iconography of Rocky and revealing the man. Creed 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for violence language and some sensuality. Stallone and Jordan make a great team in the inevitable training montages a regimen of long runs and workouts in battered boxing gyms that capture the natural rhythm of fighting. Thats the world where Rocky touches the soul of his young protege. Tessa Thompson (""Dear White People"") reaches just as deep as the nightclub singer who becomes Adonis girlfriend her dumpling cheeks and big sharp-focused eyes appraising him with a demand for 100 percent honesty at all times. The story builds through a trio of key fight scenes one three-minute barrage composed with no visible cuts as if the camera is realistically capturing a real brawl. Even in the bloodiest there are no real villains here. As Rocky tells Adonis time and again his toughest adversary is himself. The film is morally sound beginning to end. Adonis title fight triggers giddy heights of cathartic glee but thats not the storys big ending. The stirring finale comes as Stallone and Jordan slowly mount the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art the sort of nostalgic image that leaves you undecided whether to cheer or get out your handkerchief. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Jordan and Ryan Coogler electrify Sylvester Stallones boxing franchise while gently examining its legacy in terms of race and class. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan in Creed. Barry Wetcher / Warner Bros. ID 7398860 With Creed Sylvester Stallone passes the torch of his iconic boxing series to a young black man.Actually a trio of them Theres Michael B. Jordan of course baby-faced and hard-bodied and movie-star bright as Adonis ""Donny"" Johnson the son of Rocky Balboas rival and friend Apollo Creed (embodied in the first four Rocky movies by Carl Weathers) who died in the ring before the child he fathered was born. Then theres director Ryan Coogler who at age 29 was years from being born when Rocky won best picture in 1977 and who made the leap to a studio film from Sundance Film Festival breakout Fruitvale Station in which Jordan also starred. And lastly theres Aaron Covington with whom Coogler wrote the screenplay for the terrifically entertaining Creed the first film in the franchise to not be scripted by its creator. View this image > Jordan and Tessa Thompson. Warner Bros. ID 7398930 Its a tectonic shift handled matter-of-factly. Creed isnt a film that deals explicitly with race but Adoniss blackness is as much a part of his identity and his experiences as Rockys working-class Italian-Americanness was. Philadelphia the city to which Adonis moves and in which Rocky grew up is now majority black a reality the movie reflects easily in its background players from Adoniss cutman to the guys behind the counter at Maxs Steaks to the bike life kids on the corner as well as Bianca (a winning Tessa Thompson who more than holds her own against Jordan) the singer-songwriter downstairs neighbor and self-possessed beauty for whom Adonis falls.The Rocky movies follow an established formula as persistent and catchy as a pop chorus and Creed doesnt try to rewrite a melody thats worked to varying degrees for four decades. It revisits so many of the beats ingrained in American pop cultural memory -- the underdog arc the training montages the unlikely fight against the big champ the steps -- but it does so with whats primarily a cast of color presented without comment.The original Rocky movie had a current of racial unease its story tinged with an underlying fear of being edged out and replaced. It was set in a Philly that was experiencing serious white flight and racial turmoil and it depicts a world of boxing in which the dominant fighters dont look like Rocky Balboa (Stallone) or his hero Rocky Marciano. Balboa is this sweet palooka who wants to prove that he isnt actually a bum that he can go the distance that his time isnt already past. Eventually he has to win and then he had to win over his old nemesis and then he had to fight the Soviet Union on behalf of America in increasingly silly but satisfying sequels. View this image > Stallone as Rocky. Barry Wetcher / Warner Bros. ID 7398935 But when Rocky arrives at the gym early in the first film he finds his lockers been cleared out and given to a younger more promising black boxer who taunts Rocky on his way out. ""Where are the real fighters gonna come from the pros? All we got today are jig clowns"" the local bartender sneers as he and Rocky watch Apollo Creed on television the slur making it clear what a ""real fighter"" means to him even as Rocky comes to his future opponents defense.Rocky is a fable about the American dream the potential for a guy who comes from nothing to get a shot at being the champion. But its Apollo Creed who wears the stars and bars in the big fight who touts the Bicentennial theme and who reappropriates the images of first George Washington and then Uncle Sam for his dramatic entrance. Its Apollo who searches for ""a snow-white underdog"" to put on a poster and to fight a marketing decision he attributes to his own sentimentality as well as the countrys because its not a fight he expects that challenger could ever win. Its Apollo Creed who dares lay claim to the identity of the all-American hero and who gets schooled for his assurance that the world belongs to him.Rocky engineers a scenario in which its white protagonist is the underrepresented underdog the one going up against an arrogant privileged black establishment the one getting mocked for his ethnicity (""If he cant fight I bet he can cook"" Apollo says of Rockys Italian background). It gets away with the fundamental bad faith of this arrangement only because Rocky himself is so lovably guileless and sincere humbly defending and deferring to the reigning champ fighting only to prove himself not prove that hes better than someone else. View this image > Jordan and Stallone. Warner Bros. ID 7398943 Theres no resisting Rocky and Creed is as fond of him as anyone else even as in its makeup it rebuffs the first films assumptions about who the audience would see itself in. Coogler coaxes the finest performance in years out of Stallone in his supporting part -- hes funny and fumbling and vulnerable the mountainous physique betraying signs of age. Rocky may be a legend but hes still a neighborhood guy long retired from the sport running his restaurant and living alone since Adrian died between Rocky V and Rocky Balboa. The movie represents Stallones third and maybe not even his last attempt to say goodbye to the character and its easily the best because its not intent on serving as another elegy. Rocky has committed to a lonely widowers life before Adonis turns up on his doorstep asking to be trained and it takes a while for him to spark to life again to reluctantly be pulled back into boxing but also into engaging with people beyond those he lost.Hes always been a little ridiculous Rocky a guy whose quiet nobility comes from the fact that his life didnt guarantee him dignity and his relationship with Adonis grows in a way thats joyously unforced -- not quite paternal and not entirely a mentorship. Adonis calls him ""Unc."" Their ups and downs culminate in a reworking of one of the training montages that are a standard for the franchise -- one thats gutsy and touching for the way it mixes the sports in with the personal. View this image > Jordan Barry Wetcher / Warner Bros. ID 7398948 Creed reckons with Rocky without railing against it most interestingly by figuring out a way for Adonis to be an outsider that doesnt involve him establishing his bona fides by stepping on another group. Adonis isnt just Rocky rebooted and revamped. Hes something different -- not the least because hes well off. He begins the movie as an orphaned baby scrapper growing up in group homes and juvie but then Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad who like Thompson refuses to simply be turned into a plot accessory) the widow of his famous father tracks him down and takes him in despite the fact that hes the product of her husbands infidelity. As a twentysomething he lives with his loving adoptive mother in Los Angeles spending his days in a cubicle at a finance company and his weekends winning rinky-dink pro matches in Tijuana.Adonis has an education and options and no one wants him to fight. No one understands why he would when for other boxers fighting for a living is a means of survival and a way out of poverty and when Adoniss father was killed by the sport. In Rocky Apollo urges his fans ""Stay in school and use your brain -- be a doctor be a lawyer carry a leather briefcase. Forget sports as a profession."" Creed is a movie about boxing but its also one that tips its hat to Apollos message. Its hero moves to Philadelphia because everyone in L.A. refuses to train him or enable him in any way to devote his life to boxing when he doesnt have to. View this image > Jordan and Phylicia Rashad. Barry Wetcher / Warner Bros. ID 7398955 Its practically a twist the moment in which Adonis pulls up to the gated McMansion in which he did most of his growing up because its such a reversal of Rockys blue-collar origins. But it also requires a rethinking of what in this world counts as authenticity.Adonis has to battle his way past accusations of growing up with a silver spoon in his mouth and of being a legacy kid despite his complicated relationship with the father he never knew. People ask him where hes from when he talks. When he meets Bianca while asking her to turn down her music she sniffs at his story about needing to get up early to train figuring him for a gym rat rather than a pro. Later she confesses she wouldnt have guessed he was a boxer because as she puts it ""Arent most boxers street?""Boxing is tied into the mythos of bootstrapping and rough beginnings something from which Creed isnt totally immune with its opening scene in juvenile detention. But in making Adonis an upper-middle-class kid who has to choose a life of fighting rather than grasp onto it as a way out of poverty and anonymity Creed gently positions Rockys outsider origin story as one thats actually standard to a tough sport built on the idea of hard men who came from nothing. It doesnt undo its impact but it suggests there are plenty of ways to feel like an outsider and to be the underdog. View this image > Jordan and Stallone. Warner Bros. ID 7398958 Adonis with the famous last name he hates to use and his self-taught seriousness is certainly his own sort shrugging off other types of expectations of being soft and of coasting on his fathers career. Hes no bum but hes maybe a prince or at least thats the way others would like to dismiss or market him. And (after a first match dazzlingly shot in one long take) he ends up being matched against ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (played by real boxer Tony Bellew) a top-ranked British boxer whos an inspirational local hero from a working-class city with some criminal ties -- more of an alterna-Rocky than Adonis is.But Creed deftly resists any easy summarizing of its characters even as it ramps up to its brutal riveting final match Adonis is nice California kid who immediately gets labeled ""Hollywood"" but one who comes packing a rage and determination that both get him in trouble and power him through; Rickys the antagonist but hes not a villain despite his taunting -- hes trying to earn one last payday for his family before he has to go to prison; Biancas a musician dealing with progressive hearing loss legitimately more focused in taking advantage of her career while she can than having a relationship; and Rocky maybe relates more to the dead than the living. Creed understands the value of formulas and of archetypes but more importantly it knows how to push off them to find the unexpected. It feels familiar as it should but it is also in its own right electrifying.

Creed (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Creed (PG-13) Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone star in the latest installment of the Rocky saga. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/24/2015 Editor rating 3.5 Creed is the first Rocky Balboa movie Sylvester Stallone didnt write himself and its also the first film in the series that doesnt use the characters name in the title. But 40 years and five uneven sequels later director Ryan Coogler has pulled off a miracle He taps into the beautiful simplicity and deep well of emotion of the 1976 original capturing its essence and spirit while branching out into a new story. Here is the best Rocky movie since Rocky. You could argue its even better except it wouldnt exist without the first film. The protagonist this time is Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) the illegitimate son of the late Apollo Creed who was Rockys arch-enemy before they became best friends in the gaudy but immensely entertaining Rocky III. At the start of the new movie Adonis quits his job at a financial investment firm and moves out of the mansion he shares with his stepmother (Phylicia Rashad). He wants to become a boxer -- he was born to fight just like his father -- so he moves to Philadelphia and tracks down Balboa who leads a quiet life managing a restaurant named after his late wife Adrian. In recent years Stallone hasnt so much acted in movies as appear in them playing a plasticine action-figure version of himself in The Expendables and Rambo and Grudge Match or attempting to exploit his 1980 box office glory days in Bullet to the Head and Escape Plan. He hadnt given a genuine performance in so long theres an entire generation of moviegoers that has never seen him act -- and other older generations who wondered why he stopped trying. Creed suggests Stallone simply needed to be inspired which is why he handed over the reins of his most sacred franchise to the relatively untested Coogler who has directed only one other movie (Fruitvale Station). Coogler who also co-wrote Creed isnt just a huge Rocky Balboa fan He also understands what makes the character connect so strongly with audiences (his perpetual underdog status even though hes revered by millions). Despite his professional accomplishments Rocky is a tragic figure -- he has been pummeled by loss and tragedy in his personal life -- but he finds a way to keep going refusing to succumb to self-pity and depression. Stallone captures all those facets of his character in Creed keeping Rockys charisma and charm front and center -- hes a genuinely funny pleasant guy -- while reminding you of the pain he harbors inside (all of the important people in Balboas life including his late wife Adrian his former trainer Mickey and his slovenly brother-in-law Paulie make cameos of sorts). When Adonis shows up fresh-faced and eager to train Rocky isnt interested. Hes happy living out the rest of his days managing his restaurant and living in a small apartment a routine but uncomplicated life. But Adonis doesnt give up and his exuberance awakens something in Balboa. This brash good-hearted kid reminds him of his younger self. Cue the Rocky theme song. Actually dont (OK maybe just a few bars from it). Although Stallone plays a major role in Creed the movie belongs to Jordan the young actor who previously collaborated with Coogler in Fruitvale Station. Here he is handed the baton to one of the most iconic movie franchises of all time and he runs off with it rekindling its fire. Adonis isnt your typical underdog Hes rich and successful unlike Rocky was at the start and he pursues boxing purely out of passion. This is his destiny and Jordan sells you on the characters drive. The movie wouldnt have worked at all without him. Jordan has a great physicality the way any actor portraying an athlete must. But he also radiates a warmth and compassion and drive that push Adonis past the trappings of cliche and humanize him. His emotional sincerity extends to the rest of the cast. As a hearing-impaired singer Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) elevates the requisite love interest into something more vital and memorable; shes her own sort of warrior fighting her own personal fight and her character is strong enough to stand alongside Adonis instead of behind him. The performances alone would have been enough. But Coogler pushes further bringing his considerable filmmaking gifts to Creed without ever shining the spotlight on himself. You may or may not notice several complicated long takes in the movie the most formidable one being an epic five-minute shot depicting an entire boxing match from start to finish without a single cut. During one training montage Stallone tries to keep pace with Jordan at the speed bag cant keep up and walks out of the frame smiling; another director would have cut the shot but Coogler leaves it in. The Rocky hardcore will appreciate the plentiful shout-outs to the previous pictures Finally you will find out who won the friendly spar between Rocky and Apollo after the freeze-frame that ended Rocky III (even the MGM logo that opens the movie includes an easter egg; think Eye of the Tiger). And for the movies big signature moments Coogler surprises you by what he chooses to avoid and what he embraces. At one point in the film Adonis reprises Rockys iconic training run through Philadelphia as passers-by look and root him on except Coogler reimagines it in a way that is magical transcendent elevating. Its corny but its so well-earned you dont care. Jordan is carrying nothing less than movie history with him as he jogs and he makes the burden seem light. The end of the film is so perfect and beautiful I got a little teary-eyed. But they were happy tears. Creed is formulaic and predictable but its also joyful and wise and tinged with lament and it lands on the sweet spot between heartfelt art and mainstream entertainment too many Hollywood studios dont even try to hit.

This true story deftly chronicles the Boston Globe reporters who uncovered the rampant sex abuse within the Catholic Church in 2002. (The all-aces cast includes Michael Keaton Rachel McAdams Mark Ruffalo Liev Schreiber and John Slattery.) Thanks to thriller-like pacing youll be riveted as one tip leads to a source which leads to another source which crescendos with a maelstrom of damning information. The no-nonsense journalists tenacity in piecing it all together and bracing for the inevitable fallout spellbinds. The result of their labor hits you like a punch in the gut. (Prepare to gasp before the closing credits.) One of the best movies of the year its already the front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar.Take your. . . issue-minded newspaper-reading mom and dad. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvestor Stallone in Creed. Barry Wetcher 2. Creed3 stars (out of 4 stars)In theaters Nov. 25 Look who still has the eye of the tiger Nearly 40 years after the first Rocky Sylvester Stallone returns to his iconic role in a surprisingly powerful and moving drama. Stallones retired champ Rocky Balboa is now a restaurateur living quietly in Philadelphia. He reluctantly agrees to train Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) the son of his deceased foe turned friend for a big fight. It doesnt matter who wins. This installment packs a punch because it focuses on what it means to get up after life knocks you down. (Alas the screenplay includes even more boxing metaphors.) The incredible Stallone now 69 carries himself like a man who has been physically bruised and emotionally battered yet deep down remains a fighter. But Jordan is the true supernova here. In fact while Creed pays proper homage to the past the talented actor has the swagger to carry the future of the franchise on his sculpted shoulders.Take your . . . . brother boyfriend or spouse who still chokes up watching Apollo Creed die in Rocky IV.

Within an instant theyre smitten. But for two women in the 1950s a romance is socially forbidden. This is the premise of an artfully crafted drama which features stirring performances from Cate Blanchett (as cosmopolitan unhappy housewife Carol) and Rooney Mara (as reserved Therese). At first the pair represses their feelings for each other as they pursue a platonic friendship. The tension builds until they fall into each others arms. Director Todd Haynes (Far From Heaven) stages the characters fraught journey with an elegant touch; the deliberately leisurely pace leads to a hard-earned -- and quite sensual -- payoff. The two stars shape this love story though. Through Carol and Thereses most trying moments their deep connection transcends the pain. Take your. . . . arthouse movie-loving friend on either coast.

Yet small kiddies will be entertained by this sweet-but-mild effort. This is the tale of timid dino Arlo who cant help be frustrated that hes not as big and strong as the rest of his family. He finds his roar after he gets lost and must make his way home. It sounds familiar because its the plot of nearly every Pixar movie. (Think about it.) A relative dies too sigh. The studio has a knack for brilliantly crafting fare that features bright visuals for children and mature themes for adults. Just think back to this summer when Inside Out taught people to embrace their inner sadness. But here the easy message is to ""make your mark."" The lack of sophisticated for-grown-ups-only jokes and a cry-your-eyes-out resolution only add to the letdown.

""Ma"" is desperate to escape but the situation seems hopeless. Until it isnt. Thats pretty damn bleak agreed. But stick with it Okay? The amazing Tremblay narrates from Jacks point of view and he provides a wide-eyed sense of wonder to his ultraconfining surroundings. He smiles at a stray mouse and in the morning he greets all the items in ""room."" For all the suffocating claustrophobia at the outset it contrasts beautifully with the cathartic deep breaths in the second half. Indeed this small tale is filled with enormous love.Take your. . . . emotionally strongest ally who will support you when you lose your s--t. Brooklyn Fox Searchlight 6. Brooklyn4 stars (out of 4 stars)Now playing in NYC and L.A.; everywhere Nov. 27 What does it really mean to follow your heart? Thats the theme of a gorgeous coming-of-age tale sure to stand the test of time. In the 1950s shy Irish immigrant Eilis (a wonderful Saoirse Ronan) emerges from a cocoon of loneliness after she falls for a nice gregarious Italian boy (Emory Cohen) in Brooklyn. But during an extended trip to Ireland to see her family she starts spending time with a kind friend named Jim (Domhnall Gleeson). Torn between two lives Eilis shows gumption rarely seen in a female-centered film. (She may be a polite lass with impeccable table manners but boy can she tell off a nosy local.) Dont think of this movie solely as a shamelessly sappy tearjerker about picking a man Its a witty dreamy love letter to independence and self-discovery -- no matter where you call home.Take your. . . . self.

More a core part of modern-day myth than film history the Rocky series has morphed into something sweaty and slightly embarrassing an endless series of wisdom grunts anthemic trumpet fanfares politically symbolic opponents and Reagan-era showdowns. Lost in all of this was a little film called Rocky (1976) closer in spirit to the palooka redemption quests of On the Waterfront and Raging Bull and filled with the kind of street poetry that mainstream audiences used to have plenty of patience for. Creed the commandingly rousing new entry is the best thing that could have happened to Phillys favorite son--even if that means demoting the poor guy to the coaching corner. If the film feels indieish thats because it basically is one Director Ryan Coogler has but a single feature to his name--2013s socially enraged Fruitvale Station. But like many rising young directors of his generation (e.g. Star Wars rebooter J.J. Abrams) Coogler carries around the little-boy version of himself a kid at heart whose dreams have been colonized by the 70s blockbusters. Creed is a glorious literalization of that nostalgia. Its about a troubled inner-city youth turned seething young man Adonis (Michael B. Jordan the fiercely alive lead from Fruitvale Station) who knows his impulse to fight comes from his out-of-wedlock father heavyweight champion Apollo Creed who died before they ever met. Will he rise to claim his natural legacy? Its a neat reversal from Sylvester Stallones original idea in the first movie that your two-bit surroundings dont define who you are. Adonis heads from Los Angeles to the City of Brotherly Love where he chases chickens meets a tough but supportive female dreamer (Tessa Thompson) and has a rendezvous with the only man who can train him properly. Of Stallones surprisingly tender performance--a definitive late-career triumph--enough cant be said. He stares skyward when someone mentions the Cloud reads the paper at grave sites and lives in memories. But Adonis brings back the fight in him. Stallone has not only taken a risk on Coogler but submitted to a personal sea change. And when those trumpets do blare a new actor emerges.

Jordan but I was skeptical about a boxing movie as I didnt think it would have much substance. This movie; however proved me wrong. It was funny sad all at the same time. The fight/workout scenes were epic the love story was super sweet the camera work was impressive. Im wondering if there will be a second one? Id love to see where the story goes. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 16 2016Pat MFeaturedAs much as I was interested in seeing Creed I was hesitant at first. The classic Rocky series (Rocky V removed) was so iconic and I was worried that Creed wouldnt be worth it. Im really glad that I came around and finally watched this flick. Way better than I couldve hoped. It had a great backstory that paid plenty of homage to the old films. One particular scene in which Adonis shadow boxes dad after ""YouTubing"" the original Balboa v. Creed fight was particularly cool. The story plays out a bit like a fairy tale but perfectly parallels the original Rocky. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 13 2016Katie EFeaturedI was also so skeptical of this film but loved it of course It wasnt just another Rocky.  The story truly does pay homage to the original but has a very fresh take. Naturally boxing is in the main characters blood and even though he has a real job he cant help but follow his calling. Everyone loves a good heroic tale. Perfect date night movie like Rocky back in the day ;)Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 7 2015mafeloretotastemakerFeaturedI was so skeptic when I saw this film was coming out. ANOTHER Rocky? Directed by a 29 year old amateur? Yawn. Oh boy was I wrong Creed is AMAZING The story feels fresh while still nostalgic honoring the original to the core. Michael B Jordan is a star - you believe him the entire time and he truly makes you root for Adonis. Sylvester Stallone? Crushed it - what a natural beautiful performance. I was moved to tears just watching him.The film itself is very well made - the last fight is so exciting that it had the entire theater gasping for air shouting and clapping. I cant wait to see whats next for Creed.

Jordan and Sylvester Stallone give an old favorite a work-out in Creed ((WARNER BROS)) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 24 2015 at 858 AM updated November 24 2015 at 308 PM comments There have been six ""Rocky"" movies - the new ""Creed"" if you count it in the canon is now the seventh - but really there are only two kinds of ""Rocky"" movies. In the first and best kind the other guy in the ring is a formidable opponent but Rockys real enemy is himself. Its about redemption. In the second and most popular kind the other guy in the ring is an inhuman monster who needs to be stopped. Its about revenge. ""Creed"" luckily falls into the first group. In some ways its nearly a remake of the first movie only with a switch - in this telling Apollo Creeds kid Adonis has taken over the Rocky role of the kid who wants to prove himself. Rocky is now Micky the old trainer who sees the diamond in this roughneck. Adonis - winningly played by Newarks Michael B. Jordan - has overcome some rough patches to land a posh job. But what he really wants is to get in the ring and live up to the legend of the father he never knew. So he makes a Philly pilgrimage - and finds the Italian Stallion long retired from the sweet science and put out to pasture as the owner of a red-sauce joint. Will Rocky be in his corner - literally - as Adonis tries to follow in Apollos fancy footsteps? Well it wouldnt be much of a movie if he wasnt. And ""Creed"" is the best Rocky movie in a long time - largely because frankly it uses Sylvester Stallone as the sensitive actor hed always aimed at being and not the bombastic filmmaker he became. Co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler - a young African-American filmmaker behind ""Fruitvale Station"" - its trims away all the over-the-top ""Eye of the Tiger"" nonsense that cluttered up the franchise and gets back to basics. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ROCKY FRANCHISE Helping it rediscover its charm is Jordan as Adonis - ""Donny"" - a power in the ring but an awkward romantic off. (His scenes with budding singer Tessa Thompson who is excellent are absolutely genuine the dialogue sounding not scripted but overheard.) Both remind you of the Rocky/Adrian dynamic from that first human-sized movie. Also restored to normalcy is Stallone himself. Hes been a bit of movie joke in recent years - a statue as badly sculpted as the one he left behind in Philadelphia occasionally coming to vein-popping life to shoot assault weapons. But here he gives a warm human performance that avoids most of the usual ""Rocky"" cliches. Not all of them of course; Coogler gives into a few stereotypes. Of course Adonis rises to contender status in a ridiculously short period of time; of course theres a fast-cut training sequence. And of course the climactic fight with both light heavyweights going toe-to-toe pounding at each other like a pair of jackhammers looks like no real prizefight ever - and is played in the 12th round to a snatch of Bill Contis ""Rocky"" theme. But really would you want it any other way? Its still a ""Rocky"" movie.Even though I think one day its going to be talked about as the first ""Creed"" movie. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language. Creed (PG-13) Warner Bros. (132 min.) Directed by Ryan Coogler. With Michael B. Jordan Sylvester Stallone. Now playing in New Jersey.

The heros name is different but his character arc is the one fans of the series know oh so well To rise from obscurity. To get a shot at the title. To pummel and be pummeled. To go the distance. Its been that way from the very first ""Rocky"" a picture thats the template for ""Creed."" Jordan and director Ryan Coogler reunited after winning great praise for their work in 2013s ""Fruitvale Station"" work effectively to make the picture their own. Jordans character born after Apollo died didnt even know who his father was for much of his youth. His mother was a woman with whom the married Apollo had an affair. Hes embittered by having grown up fatherless in juvenile facilities. Hes a self-taught fighter who when he learns who his dad was travels from his home in L.A. to Philadelphia to seek out the man who fought then befriended his father long ago. He wants to follow in his dads footsteps but at first wants to do so under the name Johnson in hopes of escaping his fathers shadow. He has a chip on his shoulder but hes at bottom a good-hearted striver. Rocky relates to that quality in the kid and so agrees to train him. Off on the sidelines Stallone works quietly. Building on the mood he established in 2006s ""Rocky Balboa"" he turns his performance into a meditation on aging and loss. His pal Paulie is dead. His beloved Adrian is dead. Hes gray and slowed by the passage of the years and late in the movie disease is added to the equation. But hes no caricature. Stallone loves this character feeling a kinship to him at a deep emotional level. Bringing some of the most subtle acting of his career to his portrayal he invests Rocky with dignity and an affecting melancholy. The circumstances by which the championship fight comes to pass are as unbelievable as ever and the climactic bout is another knockdown drag-out affair that would have killed both fighters in real life Bill Contis famous ""Rocky"" theme is injected briefly and subtly and once more our heroes ascend slowly the so-called Rocky steps in Philly. The movies tropes are comforting in their familiarity. The tale of a decent hero fighting long odds never gets old.

Jordan and Sylvester Stallone star in Creed. Warner Bros. PicturesSylvester Stallone left and Michael B. Jordan star in Creed.(Photo Barry Wetcher)The Rocky film franchise is in better shape than it has been in years thanks to a couple of new guys with the eye of the tiger and the elder statesman whos still got punch.Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) Creed (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Wednesday nationwide) adds an exciting emotional and often funny chapter to the iconic legacy of cinematic boxing champ Rocky Balboa -- played for the seventh time by Sylvester Stallone -- and new blood in the form of Michael B. Jordan. He has the best all-around performance of his young career as Adonis Johnson the embattled and bitter son of Rocky pal/rival Apollo Creed.USA TODAYWith Creed Rocky will fight onAdonis has literally been fighting all his life from a rough childhood as an orphan to mixing it up in underground matches in Tijuana though hes constantly haunted by his father who died in the ring (see Carl Weathers swan song in Rocky IV) before the kid was born. He watches old bouts between Apollo and Rocky from YouTube projected on a big screen shadowboxing his late pops --the film is laden with metaphor but its a nicely done visual pulled off by Coogler.Wanting to be his own man in the ring and not just ""Baby Creed"" Adonis ditches a good financial job in Los Angeles for the mean streets of Philadelphia where he seeks out Rocky to train him. The old pugilist is feeling the loneliness of aging with loved ones passed and his son living his own life far away but after initially spurning Adonis the ""Italian Stallion"" finally agrees to get him ready to take on cocky light heavyweight champion ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew).USA TODAYCreed recasts Rocky as a familiar mentorAlthough it never delves into a parody of the storied franchise (the original 1976 movie won three Oscars including best picture) one knock against Creed is that it relies on the Rocky model a little too much. The movie does avoid the over-the-top aspects -- there are none of the hulking wrestlers and Soviet supermen that tussled with Rocky -- but much of the template is here from running the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to the Big Fight at the end.USA TODAYSneak peek Creed gives Rocky new lifeBut therein lie its strengths too. Coogler mines Rocky and Apollos relationship from the older films to give Creed its needed gravitas. The old Rocky musical anthems -- ring bells and all -- are mixed with hip-hop as a rousing symbol of the central generational mash-up. And the director manages to conjure the magic of a mid-fight moment as all great Rocky films do that gives audiences goosebumps and puts them solidly in the characters corner win or lose.Jordan showcases an impressive acting range as Adonis goes from angry kid to a man who cares as much for his musician girlfriend (Tessa Thompson) and an ailing Rocky as he does for winning matches. His chemistry with Stallone is especially key to Creeds success as Rocky goes ""old-school"" in training the up-and-comer (speedy chickens are involved) and Adonis manages to teach the old man some stuff too.USA TODAYMichael B. Jordan dons Creed glovesOf his many movie characters -- Marion Cobretti Lincoln Hawk and John Rambo among them -- Stallone will always be best known as Rocky. And for the first time in decades hes amazing in the role giving heartfelt speeches and adding a pathos not seen since the early films. Its a reminder that Stallone at his core is much more than the macho action hero Millennial moviegoers grew up watching.Equally powerful and feel-good Creed is an entertaining reminder that this franchise isnt down for the count yet. 600 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Hjexjf",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/11/23/creed-rocky-movie-review/76209984/,200,creed33,creed,usatoday

After all this is the seventh film in a franchise that seemed to have run its course.It doesnt matter that its directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler whose 2013 feature debut Fruitvale Station was one of the best films of that year. He wouldnt be the first celebrated indie director to slip and fall off the Hollywood ladder when reaching for the mainstream.But Creed much like Rocky himself leaves all doubts flat on the mat. Its a rousing crowd-pleasing blast of entertainment that is not only a well-made sports movie but is also a soulful cinematic love letter to Philadelphia the city that has become synonymous with Rocky Balboa.A bulked-up Michael B. Jordan ( Fruitvale Station the Friday Night Lights TV series) is Adonis Johnson a self-taught wanna-be fighter in L.A. who has a white-collar job by day but boxes in underground brawls in Tijuana by night.Raised in foster homes and then adopted by a well-heeled woman (Phylicia Rashad) who had an affair with his father he has never come to terms with the fact that hes the son of the late great boxer Apollo Creed. He doesnt even want to use his last name.But he respects his dads legacy and shares his passion for the sport. So Johnson quits his job and moves to Philly determined to track down a retired Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and use him to get in real fighting shape. Then as movie luck would have it Johnson ends up being offered the chance to take on the light heavyweight champ the invincible ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (real-life British fighter Tony Bellew).If that all seems contrived the plot machinations matter less than the convincing performances and Cooglers style. This is Jordans best work by far (his appearance in one of the years worst movies Fantastic Four is now officially forgiven) and Stallone is tough yet surprisingly nuanced as a man in his twilight years. Of course Johnson has his version of Rockys Adrian in Bianca (an impressive Tessa Thompson Dear White People) a singer who is facing a twilight of her own that will cut short her career.Coogler shoots the fight scenes in tight close-up lending them an intensity that puts viewers right in the middle of the action. The climactic battle is a real knockdown head-ringer.Yet he balances this aggression with a celebratory sense of the city that inspired Balboa. The cheese steaks the long-running music club the Electric Factory classic Philly soul (Harold Melvin amp; the Blue Notes sweeping Wake Up Everybody) and of course those famous steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art all root the story with a sense of place.It all makes for a film that will please longtime Rocky fans and newcomers to the story line. Creed doesnt just go the distance its a surprising and stunning TKO. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Movie Reviews 11/22/2015 0944pm Creed Rocky goes another round connects once again Richard Roeper richardroeper | email When we met Rocky Balboa in 1977 he was a rough-edged punch-drunk Philadelphia club fighter who worked as an enforcer for a local mobster. Rockys only friend was Paulie a brute and a drunk. He had a thing for Paulies sister Adrian. He worked out at a gym run by an old salt named Mickey. He had a couple of turtles named Cuff and Link he eventually acquired a dog named Butkus -- and of course he was plucked from obscurity to fight Apollo Creed the greatest boxer the world had ever known. Cut to present day. Rocky Balboa is almost 70 now. Just about everyone he knew or cared about is gone. He spends his days and nights quietly tending to business at Adrians the cozy Italian restaurant named after his beloved late wife. Rocky had a good run. A GREAT run. And with the exception of the unfortunate ""Rocky V"" (Tommy Gunn is the Mister Freeze of ""Rocky"" villains) we had a fantastic run with one of the most memorable movie characters of our time. Was there anything left for Rocky to say to experience? With ""Creed"" the answer is a resounding yes. Although ""Rocky Balboa"" had to stretch plausibility to the sky to get Rocky back in the ring in a legit fight (we know from the tragic Drago-Creed fight of ""Rocky IV"" that ""exhibition bouts"" can get serious in a hurry) I thought it was a strong respectful fitting farewell to the champ -- and I was worried ""Creed"" would be more gimmick or spinoff than faithful next chapter. But thanks to a charismatic natural performance from star-in-the-making Michael B. Jordan a script from writer-director Ryan Coogler that expertly navigates paying tribute to the franchise while creating an effective stand-alone film and fine work from Stallone whose work as Rocky through the years has often been underrated ""Creed"" is a terrific addition to the ""Rocky"" canon. Through a one-scene flashback and a few establishing scenes we learn of one Adonis Johnson (Alex Henderson) the product of an affair between a mother who didnt want him -- and none other than Apollo Creed who died before Adonis was born. Adonis bounces around the system until Apollos widow Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) takes the boy in. Flash forward a decade and now the 25ish Adonis (Jordan) is working for a Los Angeles financial firm during the week and sneaking down to Tijuana to fight in brutal black-market matches on the weekends. Even though Mary Anne has provided Adonis with a top education and hes a rising star in the corporate world Adonis is simmering with anger and resentment and filled with the urge to fight. He sets out for Philadelphia to make a name for himself -- and that name WONT be Creed -- as a professional fighter. Enter Rocky and you want to cheer the first time Stallone as Balboa slowly out of the shadows at Adrians still wearing that familiar hat still carrying himself like a prizefighter with every step. It doesnt take long for Rocky to figure out who Adonis Johnson really is; it doesnt take Adonis long to persuade Rocky to train him -- at Mickeys old gym now refurbished but still an old-school joint where you can practically smell the sweat and the broken dreams before you open the door. Writer-director Coogler (who directed Jordan in the excellent ""Fruitvale Station"" in 2013) takes a chance in revisiting so many familiar and beloved touchstones from previous ""Rocky"" films from the training sequences to another journey up the stone steps at the entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art to the introduction of yet another colorful seemingly indestructible champion -- this time one ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (Anthony Bellew) an undefeated undisputed light-heavyweight from Great Britain who is getting one last fight before hes off to prison. In nearly every instance (save a goofy choreographed sequence with some Philly street-bike daredevils) Coogler pulls it off in stylish fashion. While Rocky develops a (sometimes contentious) father-son bond with Adonis (Rockys own son is conveniently out of the picture having taken a job in Vancouver) Adonis strikes up a sweet romance with a smart and beautiful performance artist/musician named Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Stallone is no mere supporting player in ""Creed."" While Adonis journey is front and center Rocky is never off-screen for too long. Its arguably Stallones best piece of acting in the role since he introduced Balboa to audiences nearly 40 years ago. Once again I find myself saying if this is the last time we see Rocky Balboa its a worthy encore. [s3r star=3.5/4] Warner Bros. presents a film directed by Ryan Coogler and written by Coogler and Aaron Covington based on characters created by Sylvester Stallone. Running time 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for violence language and some sensuality).

"Review Creed is a contender for best Rocky sequel - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Creed is a contender for best Rocky sequelBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 11/23/2015 060000 AM PSTUpdated 11/24/2015 042252 PM PST Related StoriesNov 23Creed Ryan Cooglers Bay Area roots play big role in Rocky filmEveryone involved with ""Creed"" says its not the seventh ""Rocky"" film. Theres a new protagonist the studio and producers point out. Theres a new director and new writers. Yes ""Creed"" is built on six films worth of back story and the heavyweight presence of Sylvester Stallone. But its not another ""Rocky"" movie.Yes it is. And in the best way possible.For not being a ""Rocky"" movie ""Creed"" is easily the best ""Rocky"" movie since the first one. People forget after the avalanche of silliness from five sequels (I mean that in the best sense possible) that 1976s ""Rocky"" was nominated for an astounding 10 Oscars. It won best picture. Stallone was nominated for best actor and for best screenplay. It was nothing short of greatness Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson in Creed. (Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros.) In ""Creed"" ""Rocky"" finally has a worthy successor for many reasons.Up-and-coming actor Michael B. Jordan is powerfully convincing as the up-and-coming boxing progeny of the late great Apollo Creed and Richmond filmmaker Ryan Coogler (""Fruitvale Station"") delivers an authentic boxing movie which is saying something. But ""Creeds"" knockout punch is Stallone whos at his best playing a palooka stripped and beaten down by life and desperate for something to give him meaning. This version of Rocky Balboa is pushing 70. Everyone he loves has either died or moved away. He still has his restaurant but hes obviously going through the motions. His body aches his movements are forced his passion is gone. Hes basically waiting for life to end and Stallone sells it with every grunt and grimace -- to the point of him deserving to be in the conversation for a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.Advertisement Jordan is Adonis Johnson the son of Apollo Creed who was the heavyweight champ when the Rocky saga began nearly 40 years ago. Adonis is a semipro light heavyweight who fights in Tijuana at night while working a desk job in L.A. He was constantly in trouble as a kid for -- you guessed it -- fighting. Meanwhile Apollo Creeds widow Mary Anne Creed (a solid and enjoyable Phylicia Rashad) has discovered her late husband produced a child out of wedlock just before he was beaten to death in the ring during ""Rocky IV."" She finishes raising the boy but cant stop him from trying to follow in his fathers footsteps.Adonis decides to get serious about boxing moving to Philadelphia to enlist the help of Rocky who was his dads greatest boxing rival and close friend. Eventually a cynical Balboa decides to help the kid.Heres where Coogler who also co-wrote the film does a masterful job keeping ""Creed"" from spiraling into one of the aforementioned silly and cliched sequels. Of course having a first-rate actor like Jordan turn in a powerful performance as an angry young man searching for his path certainly helps. But Coogler does his part keeping the film gritty and realistic. The boxing sequences are brutally authentic (or as authentic as they can be in a ""Rocky""movie) with long continuous close shots lasting almost entire rounds. You can feel the fighters exhaustion. And in the biggest departure from previous ""Rocky"" movies the boxing depicts strategy and defensive maneuvers; not every punch lands like a hand grenade. (L-R) Ricardo Padman McGill as Padman and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa in Creed. (Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros.) That is of course until the climactic fight. Then an old-fashioned ""Rocky"" movie breaks out. But at that point its not a bad thing.Another high point is the touching screen chemistry between Stallone and Jordan that never lapses into hokum. Coogler also did a great job writing bad guys into the script who have as much substance as bluster. Unlike previous Rocky movies they are scary without having crazy Mohawks or being robotic Soviets towering a foot over our hero.Then again Rocky did hasten the destruction of the Berlin Wall after beating the Russian with that speech at the end of ""Rocky IV.""""Creed"" ends with one of the most heartfelt scenes in a ""Rocky"" movie (yes it is too a ""Rocky"" movie) paying homage to the franchise by passing a torch between the two main characters in a way that does not feel like it belongs in a Hallmark card. ""Creed"" puts a lovely bookend on Sylvester Stallones most important film work by producing some of his best moments on screen.

Extending the unkillable Rocky franchise into something like a Rocky universe by spinning off Apollo Creeds previously unseen son into his own film (nine years after the series more or less put itself to bed with Rocky Balboa) sounds as cynical as any brand extension and perhaps a last desperate step before the inevitable remake. But while Ryan Cooglers Creed starring Michael B. Jordan as the son of the Carl Weathers character from the first four Rocky movies hits plenty of expected marks that identify it as a Rocky descendant its perhaps the first such movie (including even the respectable Balboa) to feel more like a successor than an imitation.The movie shows confidence from its first moments a prologue set in a juvenile detention hall where the camera travels through a hallway into a room where two kids are fighting. It turns out one of them is a young Adonis Creed though he doesnt go by that name. The product of an extramarital affair Adonis wasnt yet born when his father Apollo was killed in a boxing match; the movie incorporates a surprising amount of Rocky franchise lore managing to redeem the cheesiness of Rocky IV where the in-ring death happens. After that opening confrontation Adonis winds up in the care of Apollos wife Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) growing up with luxury but also relative anonymity out in Los Angeles. But hes still got a lot of fight left in him and as an adult he wants to use it like his father in the boxing ring.Its here that Mary Anne makes a great point about boxing not being particularly heroic especially without the financial disadvantage that leads many fighters into the profession--and the movie is clear that the younger Creed has enjoyed certain advantages. Early on Coogler makes a startling smash cut from the young fighter victorious in an underground Tijuana fight to Jordan sitting in an office wearing a tie and a nice shirt. Diluting the purity of the heros underclass origins is a dicey proposition but the rejiggering of the underdog narrative gives Creed something to prove to the audience too. Unsatisfied by his job and nursing plenty of unresolved daddy issues he heads to Philadelphia hoping to get trained by his fathers old opponent-turned-buddy Rocky (Stallone). Rocky is a wise mentor whos reluctant to get back into the game and of course cocky champions training montages moments of doubt and contentious pre-match press conferences all lie in front of the trainer and his student.Plotwise then its all pretty standard. But Creed applies its clear formula with grit and determination making a would-be crowdpleaser like Southpaw look all the more rote in its gritty posturing. Coogler showed a lot of promise with the powerful Fruitvale Station also starring Jordan; here faced with less heavy material he ups his showmanship considerably. He makes judicious use of long takes following Adonis and Rocky off the street up some stairs and into their training gym for the first time and depicting an entire mid-movie boxing match in a single unbroken shot temporarily turning the ring into Creeds entire world. In Cooglers hands elements as basic as a training montage freeze-frames that briefly display a boxers background and statistics or a rallying run through the streets of Philadelphia become thrilling and funny again.On a pure technical level this may be the best-looking and best-made of the series. Creed also represents a number of firsts the first Rocky-related movie without ""Rocky"" in the title the one to run noticeably over two hours and--perhaps most significantly--the first time Rocky Balboas dialogue has been written by someone other than Sylvester Stallone. This version of Balboa scripted by Coogler and Aaron Covington has the same marble-mouthed easygoing charm of the previous films but its a relief to see Stallone relieved of filmmaking duties and allowed to sink further into the character. As a result the dialogue has a little more polish and depth than the usual Stallone anti-zingers (""Time takes everyone out"" Rocky muses at one point. ""Its undefeated."") and his performance is lovelier more steeped in the melancholy of old age than even his own old-Rocky revival. Hes well matched against Jordan who is less aw-shucks than his older counterpart but enormously touching as he grows attached to Balboa--and attracted to Bianca (Tessa Thompson) who has more warmth and depth than the usual sports-movie love interest. Sometimes the filmmakers get carried away in their feelings and indulge some repetitive interpersonal conflict; Creed and Balboa in particular probably have one too many big do-or-die confrontations about whos fighting for whom. More often though the movie is invigorating in its ability to reach its unexpected emotional crescendos with its visuals and music and its use of Rocky iconography as touchstones rather than strict blueprints. Creed works far better than it should and does so twice as the unexpected payoff to a nearly 40-year-old series and as the confirmation of a major talent in its director.

It starts in a juvenile-detention center in Los Angeles where young Adonis Johnson is confined. Hes soon adopted by Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad) Apollos widow who informs him that the boxer (who died before Adoniss birth) was his father. As an adult Adonis (played by Michael B. Jordan) defies Mary Anne to pursue his own boxing career moving to Philadelphia to be trained by Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) his fathers rival. The burly backstory and weight of personal history dont stall the drama but provide its fuel. Coogler--aided by the cinematographer Maryse Albertis urgent long takes--links the physical sacrifices of boxing and acting alike and binds Adoniss martial passion to his family feeling. (The focussed heat of Jordans commitment meshes well with Stallones wry haunted serenity.) Adonis also finds sweet and mature romance with the rising singer Bianca (played with febrile passion by Tessa Thompson) who has physical struggles of her own. Coogler ingeniously turns the myth of bootstrap-tugging exertions on its head without family and connections the new star of the boxing ring wouldnt stand a fighting chance.

"Creed | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; creed ) Creed (United States 2015) November 22 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli As movie-goers we have become accustomed to seeing our screen heroes as immutable and immortal. This is in part the result of how film can freeze a moment. Humphrey Bogart will always look the way he does when saying ""Heres looking at you kid."" John Wayne will never lose his swagger. Movie producers have helped to perpetuate this by making canny casting choices. There have been six James Bonds two Captain Kirks at least six Batmans at least three Supermans and so forth... But no matter how motion pictures argue against it mortality comes for us all. And in Creed it has come for one of the most iconic figures of the 20th century Rocky Balboa. Rocky played for the seventh (and last?) time by Sylvester Stallone is a shadow of the boxer who went the distance against Apollo Creed 40 years ago. He has fought his last bout. At no point during Creed does he throw a punch or get in the ring for more than a light sparring session. His body is breaking down. All his friends and loved ones have moved on either to the cemetery or elsewhere across the planet. As much as we might want to remember Rocky as the upstart who nearly beat the worlds greatest boxer in 1976 Creed forces us to confront Rocky as he is in 2015. From the title one might assume this movie is more about another boxer - Adonis (son of Apollo) Creed (played by Michael B. Jordan). Thats true but its as much about Rocky as it is about Adonis. Its a study in contrasts with Creeds ascent plotted against Rockys descent. For the latter its all about the past. For the former its the present and future. The movie potentially opens the book on one franchise while closing it on the other. Creed is crowd-pleasing in the way it illustrates the title characters trajectory but theres an unshakeable melancholy about the proceedings. We love Rocky but the Rocky we love is no more. Its a brave move by Stallone and director Ryan Coogler to go down this road. How many mainstream franchises have dared something like this? The Rocky series has seen its share of highs and lows. The first installment is rightfully viewed as a classic - one of the best sports movies ever made. It has everything heart guts glory and offers a perfect testosterone-and-adrenaline cocktail. The four immediate sequels vary from being adequate popcorn entertainment to downright awful. They are at best unnecessary and at worst sad. Rocky Balboa Stallones 2006 ""farewell"" to the character was well conceived and effectively executed - the first Rocky since the original that existed for reasons beyond making money. Creed avoids tainting Rocky Balboa by taking the narrative to the next logical level. Stallone initially reluctant to sign on for this movie (having conceived Rocky Balboa as the fighters final screen outing) agreed after hearing Cooglers pitch. Adonis Creed never knew his famous father - Apollo died before his birth. Despite being the result of an extramarital affair the boxing legends wife Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) rescued him out of the foster system and raised him as her own. Once into adulthood Adonis has all the options open to him of a college-educated man but the lure of boxing is too strong to resist. After a while small-time bouts in Mexico arent enough so he heads east to Philadelphia with the goal of being trained by Apollos once-rival and later best friend Rocky Balboa. At first Rocky refuses but Adonis persistence wins him over. And as Adonis begins preparing for bigger fights with ranked opponents he finds something he never expected a romance with his downstairs neighbor up-and-coming singer Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Perhaps one reason Creed feels more like Southpaw than Rocky is that aside from Stallones broken-down fighter no one from any of the other films is present (for the most part either the characters or the actors playing them are no longer around). This is in many ways a fresh start.  But the Art Museum steps are still there and composer Ludwig Goransson crafts a theme for Creed that recalls ""Gonna Fly Now"" without aping it.  Fans of the Bill Conti music can be reassured that Rockys song isnt forgotten. Although aspects of Creed are taken from the Boxing Movie 101 textbook Coogler is not content with copying the visual style of his Rocky predecessors. His preference for long takes is evident throughout but nowhere is it more obvious than during Creeds first big fight when the entire bout is shot without a break. The restlessly moving camera keeps the action in focus while moving to vary the perspective but without ever turning this into a shaky-cam affair. Its an effective way to generate tension and create a sense of immediacy. As the title character Michael B. Jordan is re-united with his Fruitvale Station director Coogler. Jordan is a good enough actor that hes able to provide heft to the dramatic scenes and be credible in the ring. Stallone often ridiculed for his one-note portrayals gives his best performance since Copland astounding with the depth and sincerity of his work. With assists from the composer and cinematographer Maryse Alberti Stallone makes Rockys loneliness palpable. With Adrian and Paulie gone and his son Robert living elsewhere Rocky has no one. To the extent that Creed is a boxing movie it delivers everything one expects from a film of the genre. The fights are well-staged and the climactic bout pits the protagonist against a suitably nasty opponent. Coogler provides enough rousing moments to get the adrenaline pumping - there are times when the urge to jump up and cheer is almost too strong to resist. But theres more to Creed and it is elevated by the quiet subtle elements. Much as Rocky became a classic and won a Best Picture Oscar because of the importance of the Rocky/Adrian love story so Creed advances to a higher orbit by focusing on the Adonis/Rocky relationship and the decline of a man once thought to be indomitable. 2015 has seen its share of sequels; perhaps surprisingly Creed is among the best.

Jordan as Adonis Johnson in the new Rocky movie ""Creed."" (Warner Bros.)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted November 23 2015Theres a scene early in Creed inside Adrians that famous South Philly eatery run by the mumbling restaurateur Rocky Balboa. A young man walks in and eyes the pictures on the wall - photographs of the heavyweight champs legendary bouts most notably his epic collisions with Apollo Creed.""Apollo? Yeah he was great"" Rocky says to the stranger played with a beautiful burning intensity by Michael B. Jordan. ""He was the perfect fighter. Aint nobody ever better.""""So howd you beat him?"" the guy asks.""Time beat him. Time takes everybody out. Its undefeated.""Creed the brainchild of Fruitvale Station director Ryan Coogler in collaboration with screenwriter Aaron Covington and with the generous and genuinely inspiring participation of one Sylvester Stallone hands the Rocky mantle - and the gloves and the jump rope and the training montages - to a new underdog determined to box his way to glory. Time is on his side.Jordan who played Oscar Grant the Oakland Calif. black man shot and killed by a transit cop in FruitvaleStations restaging of the real-life tragedy has the title role in Creed.At that first encounter in Adrians though he introduces himself to Rocky as Adonis Johnson (no Miami Vice jokes please). Thanks to a prologue set in an L.A. juvenile detention facility and then in the home of Apollo Creeds widow (Phylicia Rashad) we already know the kids true lineage - and name.Hes the illegitimate son of the once undisputed heavyweight champion of the world played by Carl Weathers in the original Rocky and its first three sequels. Adonis has been fighting since he was a boy back in juvie. He walks out of a promising job with an investment firm. He comes to Philadelphia. And he wants his dads old friend to train him.""I dont do that stuff no more"" Rocky says taking his glasses off to give Adonis a serious once-over.Of course Rocky does agree to train Adonis and though he doesnt send his protege to the meat locker to pound on frozen carcasses he gets him to wake up before the wintry dawn and run all over town - the Ninth Street Market Front Street in Kensington along the Schuylkill the Art Museum - and spar relentlessly in the ring.Cue the Bill Conti theme music but also cue Meek Mill the Roots and John Legend.Music is integral to Creed not just on the sound track but in Adonis new life in Philadelphia The downstairs neighbor in his apartment building is Bianca (Tessa Thompson) a singer/songwriter who works on her trippy soulful tunes at full blast. She invites Adonis to see her show at Johnny Brendas. Then he gets her to take him for cheesesteaks at Maxs.He never says ""Yo Bianca"" but a romance is born while she works on her career and he on his. And while Rocky starts to feel not so good. He goes to the doctor and the diagnosis is grim. Time might not be on his side.Creed is corny like the old Rocky films but riveting like the old Rocky films too.The fights - the big Third Act match pits upstart Adonis against a fierce Brit ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (played by power-punching cruiserweight Tony Bellew) - are staged and shot with 360-degree impact and artistry. Coogler knows his boxing movies and Jordan knows his boxing moves. The body blows the hits to the head are visceral and convincing.Stallone took Rocky all the way to the bank - and to the Academy Awards in 1977 where it beat out All the Presidents Men and Taxi Driver for best picture.It is not inconceivable - not at all - to imagine Creed in the running in the same category when nominations are announced early next year. And for Jordan to be in the running for best Actor and Stallone in the supporting actor lineup.""Everyone here knows theyve seen something special"" Rocky says after Adonis climactic fight.Its hard to argue with the man.sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629Steven_Rea Creed (Four out of four stars) Directed by Ryan Coogler.

"Creed review Stallone coaches Michael B. Jordan everybody wins - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Creed review Stallone coaches Michael B. Jordan everybody wins Creed Warner Bros. Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa and Michael B. Jordan plays Adonis Johnson in ""Creed."" Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa and Michael B. Jordan plays Adonis Johnson in ""Creed."" (Warner Bros.) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The best ""Rocky"" movie since ""Rocky."" Back in 1976 our bicentennial year the nation yearned for a red white and blue plate special piled high with corn. Something to believe in. Then up those Philadelphia Museum of Art steps backed by the Bill Conti theme that something arrived.Nobody went to the first ""Rocky"" for the finesse of the filmmaking. They went for the underdog-rooting for Rocky and Adrian for the unexpected sweetness for the redemption angle for the reconstituted boxing movie cliches that tasted not new but new-ish. It was simply time for ""Rocky"" written and starring Sylvester Stallone directed by John Avildsen. I saw it three times when it came out. With the rest of the ""Rockys"" the ones concerned with ego and celebrity and increasingly contrived suffering once was enough although No. 6 ""Rocky Balboa"" in 2006 wasnt bad. That one went easy on the melodrama and sent Stallones beloved franchise character into the sunset with a semblance of class albeit an excess of jet-black hair dye. So ""Creed"" a seventh ""Rocky"" movie? Apollo Creed Rockys old nemesis turned best friend had a son who grows up a scrappy fighter in the LA foster care system? Moves to Philly connects with Rocky whos tending the restaurant and still wearing that hat? Rocky trains him for a big fight?Thats how it goes yes. And damned if ""Creed"" isnt easily the best ""Rocky"" movie since ""Rocky."" There is in fact more filmmaking savvy in co-writer and director Ryan Cooglers prowling opening shot introducing us to young Adonis Johnson in a 1998 LA prologue than there was in all of the 76 original. Most of the pictures set in the present day. Michael B. Jordan is Adonis who keeps his famous deceased father a secret so he can stake his own claim in the ring.Rocky likes the kid but the kid has to learn to fight smart not fight angry. Well smart and angry thats the ticket. Rockys initially reluctant; he hasnt visited the old boxing gym in years. Its a quiet life. He has a few actual gray hairs now. Mellow but melancholy. These two lugs young lug and old lug have much to learn from each other. The first of three training montages kicks in as does Adonis romance with the musician downstairs Bianca (Tessa Thompson from ""Dear White People"" and a huge asset here). Rocky faces a life-threatening health crisis; Adonis faces a vicious Brit (played by ABA heavyweight champ Anthony Bellew) in a Liverpool title match. Creed trailer ""Creed"" starring Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan is set for theaters on November 25 2015. ""Creed"" starring Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan is set for theaters on November 25 2015. See more videos ""Creed"" is two movies. One cleverly and even movingly repositions Stallones Rocky as a mentor figure who actually seems like a real person again not a lacquered icon. The other imagines Jordans Adonis as a separate but intimately related underdog saga in the making. Half the film written by Coogler and Aaron Covington revels in cliches skillfully. The other half sidesteps them and concentrates on scenes and relationships that breathe easily and draw us in the hard way not by narrative fiat or bald calculation but through well-written and shrewdly acted encounters.Theres a sweetness in Jordans screen presence just as there was (and is at his best) in Stallones and you believe in the flowering relationship between Adonis and the singer-songwriter played by Thompson because ""Creed"" takes the time. Coogler and Jordan teamed for the excellent fact-based drama ""Fruitvale Station"" and Cooglers astutely judged camera sense serves him very well with this material. He has an instinct for keeping the actors small in the frame and letting the surroundings say something about their predicaments their emotional states. I fear that a lot of what makes ""Creed"" better than youd expect -- the character stuff -- may work against it at the box office. But you never know; quality sometimes wins out although its Stallones aging Rocky who at one point in ""Creed"" notes ""Time takes everybody out. Times undefeated."" Thats a pretty sticky line but the way Stallone says it under his breath the corn works; it feels like a moment overheard not a thesis line hammered. With ""Creed"" Coogler proves he is one of the most skillful young directors around. Turns out we really did need another ""Rocky"" movie. It just needed to keep Rocky in perspective and in proportion.Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune""Creed"" -- 3.5 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence language and some sensuality)Running time 212Opens Wed.

Jordan Sylvester Stallone Wood Harris; Director Ryan Coogler; Release Date Wide 11/25/2015; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted November 18 2015 -- 1114 AM EST Dont be fooled by the title. For all intents and purposes Creed is Rocky 7. But it would be a mistake to be put off by the wheeziness of that late-stage number. Because with apologies to Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago Ryan Cooglers rousingly emotional new film is the best installment since the 1976 original. Its easy to read that last sentence and shrug. But Sylvester Stallones first Rocky was a dark downbeat masterpiece that reflected its New Hollywood era. Creed taps into that same gritty underdog authenticity. Michael B. Jordan reteaming with his Fruitvale Station director plays Adonis Johnson--the out-of-wedlock son of Rockys love-hate rival Apollo Creed. RELATED Everything you need to know about Apollo Creed before seeing Creed Adonis who never knew his father was saved from a troubled childhood by Apollos widow (Phylicia Rashad). Now grown and hungry to make a name for himself in the ring he refuses to use his famous surname. Adonis begs Rocky to train him. And slowly the  aging Italian Stallions reluctance melts when he sees how much the brash kid reminds him of himself back when he was a no-hope southpaw pounding frozen sides of beef. Creed is as formulaic and sentimental as youd expect any Rocky movie to be but Jordan and Stallone (looser and more vulnerable than hes been in 30 years) give the film an undeniable lump-in-the-throat poignancy. In the end its a movie about legacy and it more than preserves the Rocky franchises. It reminds you why it was great in the first place.

Jordan Pulls Race Bait and Switch With White Roles Comments Wrap Trends (Video) The Good Dinosaur Review Pixars Prehistoric Tale Improves as It Evolves Sylvester Stallones back but this generational twist on the underdog series never lands any original blows ""Creed"" approaches a 40-year-old franchise thats gone the distance -- Sylvester Stallones saga of Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa -- from an admirably different perspective that of Rockys late rival/friend Apollo Creeds son Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) who has his own boxing dreams and knows just the mumbling Philly warhorse to help him achieve them. A Balboa-Creed reunion of sorts after Apollos mid-match demise three movies ago in 1985s ""Rocky IV"" the film also reteams Jordan with his ""Fruitvale Station"" writer-director Ryan Coogler. But that one-two punch of expectations -- energizing a franchise and burnishing the acclaim heaped upon ""Fruitvale"" -- seems to have gotten the best of Coogler so that ""Creed"" emerges as a reverent entry but never a truly refreshed one. See Video Sylvester Stallone Helps Michael B. Jordan Pack a Punch in First Trailer for Rocky Spinoff Creed The opening suggests thematic promise showing us a 13-year-old Adonis Creed a foster-home hopper in juvenile detention walloping a fellow inmate. Coogler and co-screenwriter Aaron Covingtons sharp character notion is that Adonis an illegitimate child who entered the world after Apollos death has a hole to fill from never knowing his famous dad. Apollos widow Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) adopts him and he grows up in luxury but as a young man on a career track in finance (when Jordan takes over) hed rather secretly box in Tijuana where he racks up a 15-0 record and study his dads fights on YouTube. Spurned by L.A. trainers who scoff at his self-taught status Adonis decamps to the City of Brotherly Love and tracks down the Italian Stallion still running the restaurant he named after deceased wife Adrian and wary about playing Mickey (Burgess Merediths father-figure trainer in the original ""Rocky"") to another kid with something to prove. That reticence doesnt last long once Rocky is convinced he sees Apollos talent in Adonis and the training and motivational platitudes kick in. (""Thats your toughest opponent"" Rocky says to Adonis reflection in the mirror.) The biggest irony about ""Creed"" is that whats missing inside Adonis is a nagging question mark for the movie too. Carl Weathers Apollo Creed was a galvanizing force in the first four ""Rocky"" movies but without him here save the odd snippet of boxing footage ""Creed"" creates a strange distance between the brassy entertaining cockiness of Weathers performance as fondly remembered by moviegoers and the necessity of his absence being a driving force for Adonis. Though Jordan hits plenty of solid chip-on-his-shoulder notes in his portrayal of someone wondering whether his name is a blessing or a curse the movie is like a ghost story without a ghost. (Although you do learn who won that private Rocky-Apollo bout that closes ""Rocky III."") None of this would have mattered had Adonis been written with a personality equal to Apollos or Rockys but Coogler and Jordan fall short of making the youngster as compelling a figure. The mechanical parts of the story dont serve Jordans natural charisma the way ""Fruitvale"" jazzed everyday moments. By now Stallone wears Rocky like a favorite tracksuit and hes a believably older version of his good-hearted underdog. But his scenes with Jordan rather than being organically warm feel dictated by formula. See Video Creed Star Michael B. Jordan Weighs in on Playing Apollos Son in EPIX Teaser The screenplays fighting-in-life metaphors arent memorably explored either. Adonis love interest -- tough talented singer girlfriend Bianca (an underused Tessa Thompson ""Dear White People"") -- makes one mention of a hearing-loss condition on their first date before being sidelined as inspirational movie support staff. Later ""Creed"" uncorks a third-act health scare for Rocky that feels conveniently shoved in to give both mentor and mentee equal dramatic footing on the uphill-battle front. But even as a standard issue path-to-identity sports movie ""Creed"" has its undeniable pleasures when that bell rings. Cooglers fight scenes augmented by Jordans commanding physique and cinematographer Maryse Albertis nimble cinematography boast a fleet visceral immediacy with Adoniss debut U.S. bout thrillingly choreographed and shot as one circling ducking weaving take. And while the movies big showdown opponent a Liverpudlian bruiser named ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan may not have the cartoony heft of Mr. Ts or Dolph Lundgrens 80s-era foes real-life heavyweight champ Anthony Bellews perma-snarl performance is grin-worthy. Also Read Michael B. Jordan Ryan Coogler to Reteam for Education Scandal Movie Wrong Answer ""Creed"" doesnt forget to pay homage to ""Rocky"" touchstones either the iconic steps outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art get a sweet poignant nod at the end and Bill Contis soaring fanfare makes an appearance. But an attempt at giving Adonis his own training montage crescendo surrounded during a street run by bikers doing wheelies doesnt quite work. Few longstanding franchises have been so personally tended to as the ""Rocky"" movies with Stallone variously lauded and vilified for scattershot handling of his own beloved American loser-turned-hero. If 2006s correctively quieter old-school charming ""Rocky Balboa"" felt like a fitting close to an invariably overextended series you can see why this entry -- the first one not written by Stallone -- suggested a reason to continue. But instead of playing like the first of a series of Adonis Creed movies ""Creed"" never rises above being one more by-the-numbers ""Rocky"" retread.

November 18 2015 | 0600AM PT Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver knockout performances in Ryan Cooglers Rocky spin-off which lives up to the best of its predecessors while forging its own path. Defying conventional wisdom about diminishing returns this holiday season will see the release of the seventh installment in an iconic 1970s film franchise that not only lives up to the best of its predecessors but also respectfully forges its own path. (Hopefully the new ""Star Wars"" movie is good too.) With his ""Rocky"" spinoff ""Creed"" writer-director Ryan Coogler confirms every bit of promise he displayed in his 2013 debut ""Fruitvale Station"" offering a smart kinetic exhilaratingly well-crafted piece of mainstream filmmaking and providing actor Michael B. Jordan with yet another substantial stepping stone on his climb to stardom. Yet the biggest surprise may be Sylvester Stallone Appearing in the first ""Rocky"" film that he didnt also write -- and the first in which he takes on a supporting role -- the veteran channels all his obvious love for the character into his performance digging deeper as an actor than he has in years. Despite some heavyweight competition over Thanksgiving weekend ""Creed"" should still be a contender at the box office. A first-scene flashback introduces Adonis Johnson (Alex Henderson) as an adolescent in a Los Angeles juvenile detention center busted for fighting in what we assume is a regular occurrence. An orphan whos been bounced from one institution to another he receives an unexpected visit from one Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad) who tells him that hes the illegitimate son of her late husband former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. Flash forward to the present day and the twentysomething Adonis (Jordan) -- Donnie to his friends -- is still living with Mary Anne in the white-marble chez Creed making abortive attempts to work an office job while heading to Tijuana for black-market weekend prize fights. A talented boxer with a weakness for writing checks that his gloves cant yet cash he decides to decamp for Philadelphia against his surrogate mothers wishes to train with the man who knew his fathers skills best professional nemesis-turned-friend Rocky Balboa (Stallone). Still tending to his restaurant and making regular visits to his late wife Adrians grave Rocky takes some convincing to get back in the game as a trainer but he soon relents and the two start to develop a touch-and-go familial bond. Adonis also meets antagonistic with his downstairs neighbor a bohemian avant-garde Ramp;B musician named Bianca (Tessa Thompson very brash very flinty very Philly) and strikes up a romance. At first Adonis tries to keep his parentage under wraps but after an early victory the information leaks and thanks to the publicity hes offered an underdog shot at the title British light-heavyweight champion ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (Anthony Bellew) is set to begin a potentially career-ending prison sentence in six months and needs an opponent for his swan-song bout in Liverpools Goodison Park. Meanwhile Rocky confronts a serious personal battle of his own and his trainer-fighter relationship with Adonis is turned on its head in a number of genuinely touching ways. ""Creed"" makes no bones about retreading a number of ""Rockys"" story beats not to mention reaching back into the archives a few too many times for key locations costume elements and music cues. But its the details that elevate this material Adonis helping braid Biancas hair and the two collapsing in a post-bout ice-cream coma; the fact that Bianca sometimes wears a hearing aid (her progressive hearing loss isnt treated as a symbolic plot point but simply as a fact of the characters life); Adonis hilarious -- and immediately believable -- physical manifestation of nervousness in his dressing room. Cut and spry Jordan looks every inch a fighter and the physicality of his performance is matched by some well-rounded internal gymnastics Adonis bears a chip on one shoulder from his group-home past and one on the other from his treatment as a sort of legacy admission into the boxing world and Jordan manages to make his characters fiery temper empathetic rather than alienating. This being a ""Rocky"" movie it goes without saying that the training montages are plentiful and the climactic battle is a dialed-up leave-it-all-on-the-canvas epic featuring virtuosic editing and one bloodily beautiful extreme-slow-motion shot. Yet its earlier in the film that Coogler really ups the technical ante. Shot in what appears to be a single take Adonis first major fight is staged with breathtaking precision the camera circling in and out of the scrum almost close enough to become a participant itself the two fighters hitting their marks perfectly and separate sound channels piping in bursts of crowd noise and shouted trainer instructions from all sides adding up to an immensely immersive experience. As a viewer one starts the fight admiring the filmmaking technique and ends it with shredded fingernails. As wildly uneven as they became the ""Rocky"" films have always been unusually attuned to the constancy of personality through extreme life changes. Even after becoming a rich famous hometown legend (and later after the loss of most of his family and fortune) Rocky has always been essentially the same person for better or worse -- a lovable lug with a steady undercurrent of self-doubt and loneliness. Coogler and co-writer Aaron Covington understand this about the character and Stallones degree of confidence in his director shows through. Without straining for pathos using his battered body as an asset but never as a prop the actor finds continually surprising understated notes of tenderness and regret. For all its flaws 2006s ""Rocky Balboa"" at least offered a dignified sending off for the Italian Stallion and the risks of reprising the character yet again were surely considerable; Stallone deserves credit for taking a chance on the young director and his trust has paid off in spades.

TWITTER Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) takes a stab at studio filmmaking with this Rocky spinoff starring Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. Sylvester Stallone doesnt get back in the ring in Creed but he still comes away as a big winner in this far-fetched but likeable offshoot of the geriatric Rocky series as he may be more appealing playing the aging Rocky Balboa than hes been since the beginning of his 40-year career. Essentially taking on the role of Burgess Merediths old trainer Mickey character from the series early days the veteran actor delightfully registers as a paisano from the old neighborhood a man of the streets whos lived his life fought his battles and has no more scores to settle. From the points of view of director-co-writer Ryan Coogler and star Michael B. Jordan this marks some major mainstreaming after their bracing 2013 breakthrough with Fruitvale Station; dramatically its the same old Rocky formula applied now to the hitherto unknown son of the late Apollo Creed. It worked before and commercially looks to work again. The first film to use the Rocky character not to have been written by Stallone himself Creed nonetheless follows the patented prescription quite closely especially when it comes to the unlikely shooting-star career trajectory of the title character. The central conceit is that Rockys fearsome Muhammad Ali-like opponent from the first four series entries left behind an illegitimate son who after a rough largely parentless childhood begins pursuing the fight game in seedy venues in Tijuana. Thinking he might be good enough to follow in his famous fathers footsteps Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) has no trouble tracking down Rocky at the Philadelphia Italian restaurant Adrians named after the boxers late wife and only slightly more difficulty convincing him to guide him in his quest to become a first-rate fighter. Despite initial resistance its a given that Rocky will cave and help the kid out and Stallone is at his near-best as he charmingly walks the line between weary resignation at the encroachment of old age and the inextinguishable desire to get back in the game again. Read more Will Creed Song Fighting Stronger Be the New Eye of the Tiger? The script by Coogler and his former USC grad school classmate Aaron Covington follows a notably formulaic line from here on Rocky hones and shapes his new charge whos never been trained in a professional manner eventually taking him back to his old Front Street Gym; Rocky goes to the cemetery to sit and talk with Adrian while Adonis meets neighbor Bianca (Tessa Thompson Dear White People Selma) who just happens to be an extremely foxy singer whos doing some local performing at the moment making possible some club scenes. An interesting touch has Bianca coping with a degenerative hearing problem that forces her to wear hearing aids and the screenwriters introduce one other physical affliction that may be unique in the history of Hollywood sports movies and incidentally provides the films biggest laugh Right before his first legit fight Adonis becomes so nervous that he demands that the strings of his boxing gloves be cut so he can go take an emergency crap. Melodrama and the exigencies of fantasy-fulfillment plotting demand that a high-stakes fight be arranged for Adonis far earlier in his career than would ever be the case in real life. Positioned exactly half-way into the film his first East Coast bout sees the hopeful getting banged up a bit before getting the feel of things. More interesting is the way its been shot -- all in one take for the first round with the steadicam moving around the ring in a manner as agile as the boxers themselves and always catching the key action. Winning this match-up also lets the cat out of the bag that this kid is the son of Apollo Creed. The news attracts the attention of arrogant British undefeated light-heavyweight champ ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan who for reasons of his own needs a quick fight and sees a big and presumably easy payday in taking on the inexperienced American with such a famous lineage. A troubling and perhaps unnecessary medical subplot intrudes at this point to pad out the drama but the central formula remains unchanged Can a relatively untested but immensely appealing underdog go toe-to-toe with a beast in the ring? The Liverpool setting of the climactic bout Anthony Bellews attractive toughness as Conlan and Scottish actor Graham McTavishs rough authenticity as the latters manager provide a welcome new flavor to the film as well as to the series as a whole. Still the action of the big fight (an HBO broadcast) feels hyped up unrealistically contrived and pretty far from convincing leading as with most of the Rocky films themselves to an unimaginably frenzied final round in which the result is parsed to highly calculated dramatic effect. The door is certainly left open for more where this came from if audience response warrants it. Coogler makes the transition from the indie world to big-budget studio filmmaking with a result thats sturdy and smooth. Buffed into ring-ready shape Jordan acquits himself well both in and out of the ring even if the innermost aspects of Adonis insecurities and issues arent as extensively explored as they might have been. Thompson seriously brightens every scene shes in while Phylicia Rashad as Apollos widow mostly looks on supportively from afar. The score by Ludwig Goransson and a varied array of musical samples gives the score a very different feel from that of the Rocky sextet although an echo of Bill Contis famous theme floats through at one point. Phillys Rocky Steps also make a key appearance at the end. Along with several others including their own sons original Rocky producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff continued their involvement on this one although Chartoff died in June. The film is dedicated to him. Production M-G-M Warner Bros. New Line Cinema Chartoff Winkler Productions Cast Michael B.
