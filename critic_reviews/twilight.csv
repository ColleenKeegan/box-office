Directors can get pigeonholed into certain kinds of movies just as easily. Its why in the old days of the studios Ernst Lubitsch always made sophisticated comedies with European settings George Cukor stuck mostly to ""womens pictures"" and Howard Hawks excelled at adventure films and breezy comedies starring tough guys and gals. And that didnt ease off any as films became even more of a directors medium in the 1960s and 70s with the rise of the auteurs. In fact directors even more came to be seen as having a recognizable touch particularly when examining topics and themes to which they seemed inexorably drawn. Martin Scorsese whose first breakout film was 1973s ""Mean Streets"" has returned again and again in succeeding decades to its themes of crime and friendship amidst gritty urban settings. The late French director Claude Chabrol was clearly fascinated by issues of crime and class which he focused on repeatedly in his elegant thrillers. Even Ben Affleck an auteur in the making with two well-received films under his belt (""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"") seems to be specializing in crime dramas among the working class in Boston. Such specialization is not always a good thing. At some point directors can start to repeat themselves running dry on fresh inspiration. Thats certainly the case for Catherine Hardwicke with ""Red Riding Hood."" This is Hardwickes fifth film and her first since she directed 2009s ""Twilight"" the initial movie in the blockbuster series beloved by tween and teen girls everywhere. She may be 55 in real life but shes in something of a teen rut. All five of her movies starting with 2003s disquieting indie ""Thirteen"" have focused on teenagers. Her follow-up ""Lords of Dogtown"" was about teen skateboarders; ""The Nativity Story"" was about a pregnant teenage Mary; and ""Twilight"" was about the love a high school student Bella has for Edward a smoldering-eyed classmate who just happens to be a vampire. ""Red Riding Hood"" is more of the same with a special kinship to ""Twilight."" Were in the realm of the supernatural again as screenwriter David Leslie Johnson (""Orphan"") plays off of the classic fairytale. The setting is a vaguely European rural village during the Middle Ages. Little Red Riding Hood is Valerie (Amanda Seyfried who mostly acts by widening her eyes to convey fear or apprehension) who has been in love since childhood with Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) now a poor woodcutter. Her parents however arrange for her to marry the equally hunky Henry (Max Irons son of Jeremy Irons and Sinead Cusack) an ironsmith who uses only half as much product in his hair as Peter. Whats a girl to do when she has to choose between two but and cant be sure that either isnt actually the marauding wolf man who is bloodily picking off villagers? Her grandma (Julie Christie a long way from ""Dr. Zhivago"" and ""Shampoo"") tries to offer comfort but she has mighty big eyes too. Hardwicke has directed all of this with little suspense or subtlety. She seems most interested in composing ravishing shots featuring Valeries long red cloak whipping about her in the wind while she walks through snow-covered fields and forests. Pretty yes but in a too studied overly art-directed kind of way. The acting is so stilted the extras so annoying (they behave as if theyre in a boisterous beer commercial) and the story so uninvolving that halfway through you realize you couldnt care less whodunit. This one is strictly for teen viewers who can afterward debate endlessly whether theyre on Team Peter or Team Henry or for that matter Team Peter or Team Edward.

That dynamic first love obsession jealousy possessiveness vulnerability and an unwavering mutual attraction these are the components that elevate Twilight though of course it shares them with a few-hundred years of literary tradition. Unfortunately Twilight the film offers very little in the way of great filmmaking to compliment the book. Instead it delivers exactly and precisely what the fans wanted. This was probably a good move for everyones personal safety but a bad move if the goal was to make a movie that would have broad appeal. I would say the two main issues the film has are 1. Tone 2. Pacing Well start with problem one. The tone of the film is most decidedly ""teengirlriffic."" Every emotion is overplayed and overstated every scene drips with an immature melodrama. Both Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are guilty throughout this of rushing the moments with Stewart in particular trying to convey a few dozen emotions with each word of dialogue. Nothing is done in the movie without an overriding arc of awkwardness. I get that the teen years are dramatic and that every interaction is heightened by the newness of the situation. But as an audience member its impossible to keep up that level of mania. Far easier to roll the eyes and disconnect. As far as pacing goes the book is better no shock there. From the first moment Edward and Bella meet the movie has them madly in love. The book did a much better job with the conflict of the matter (potentially getting eaten). The movie version offers no real tension at all besides with the villain. Its as though the movie has taken for granted that these two are going to be together and doesnt really need to show it. Director Catherine Hardwicke was intent on providing a visual treat but she left the actual story out of the equation. In fact and even worse shes made the point of this movie James. By putting the ""danger"" aspect throughout the film shes completely cribbed the tension between Edward and Bella -- a tension that is the absolute crux of the story. Thats a shame. Could Twilight have been a good movie? Yes. Unequivocally. The movie has some really nice moments moments where Hardwicke deviated completely from the book and used her own creativity. The stylized end credits are cool. The sepia-infused dream sequences have merit. And Pattinson and Stewart probably could have produced real acting if they were given half a chance. They werent. For me the story of Twilight is all about that balance between obsession and actual mature love. When youre first in love you lose all sense of context and are completely drawn into another person. The movie doesnt get any of that though the only story here seems to be ""We love the fans"" The amazing noise drummed up by everyone probably caused this film to lose its way burying it somewhere between the 25th autograph session and the latest blog post from the Twi-Hards. So while the fans got exactly what they wanted they wont be getting others to jump on this bandwagon. Without the supplemental material from the book this film feels very silly. Perhaps this little experience can teach us (and Summit) the real lesson of Stephenie Meyer. Despite our best efforts sometimes we hurt the ones we love. Sometimes were incapable of telling people what they need to hear preferring to tell them instead what they want to hear. My hope is that the sequels are actual attempts at movies. The world doesnt need any more toothless cinema.

Protagonist Bella Swann (Kristen Stewart) is presumably the point of identification. Sent to live with her dad in small-town Washington state shes the archetypal new girl. Neither geeky outsider nor social magnet she hardly dares to dream that resident enigmatic hunk Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) would give her a second glance. However it turns out hes as smitten as she is but theirs is destined to be a complicated relationship since hes a hundred-year-old bloodsucker whose powers of restraint are sorely tested by her mere presence. One snog and he might rip out her throat ...Its hard not to read this as some slightly sinister metaphor for the perils of fornication and the wonders of abstinence yet at the same time there is something tantalisingly swoony about impossibly elusive gratification. With brooding mist-wreathed mountains an effective backdrop the key performers strike sparks from the electric tension of not-quite-kissing though its soon obvious that theres nowhere else for the story to go. Given the tween-accessible rating blood-drenched carnage isnt an option and neither the fey pale-faced vampire clan nor the mild final-reel pursuit carry a significant degree of threat. Some will find it all too polite but compared to rival blockbuster exercises in explosive CGI mayhem its character-based index of longing and protectiveness at least provides a viable alternative moodscape.

But it is a much softer experience than Thirteens litany of teen horrors.Fittingly given the peculiar imperatives of the vampire aesthetic demanded by Twilight Hardwicke started out in production design working on Tombstone Tank Girl Three Kings and Vanilla Sky. In 2005 she directed Lords of Dogtown a cool-as skateboard saga starring Heath Ledger and Emile Hirsch.Clearly shes game to brush with the more acidic tributaries of teen culture and she would need to be. Stephanie Meyers humungously successful series of Twilight vampire novels commands a hungry legion of fanatical teen fans who have haunted the film from its inception. There was an uproar when Robert Pattinson last seen as the handsome quidditch captain in Harry Potter was cast as Edward Cullen Twilights Byronic lead heartthrob. Fortunately or not -- and Pattinson himself seems to be slightly unsure -- his smouldering performance has won the adoration of girls around the globe They ambush me in public and ask me to bite them and want to touch my hair he recently revealed somewhat nervously.In its opening weeks Twilight pushed Baz Luhrmanns Australia off the screens in America second only to Four Christmases and ahead of the nasty new Bond outing Quantum of Solace. Its not hard to see why. I took a 12-year-old colleague who had to fan herself throughout most of the film and was still muttering Hes so hot... hours after the screening.Give just about any teenage girl a pale brooding malnourished and slightly androgynous young male with a bruised ego and very few social skills and she will want to take him in her arms and nurse him back to erotic health as quick-as. Hardwicke handles the morbid intensity of the adolescent crush with a rare mix of hyperbole and restraint.When Bella Swan (and theres an evokative moniker if ever there was one) leaves Texas to live with her dad in wintry Washington State her first day of school sets the pattern for her ensuing adventures. Shes an outsider but she soon spots a group of students who revel in their freakishness.While the initial appearance of the Cullen clan is a bit of a laugh -- they are so pale and their teeth seem to light up like neon even more than the standard issue American actors teeth -- they carry themselves with a seductive glittering insouciance. In fact Edward Cullen is so brooding as to make most adults shudder with ill concealed mirth; hes almost in a coma hes smouldering so hard.Clearly bad news and possibly off limits Bella conceives an instant fascination for the tongue-tied Romeo. And therein lies the tale. Modern vampires it would seem dont get on much with each other roughly dividing into the equivalent of highly disciplined vegans (the Cullen clan) and rampaging carnivores (a crew of ultra sulkies who blow in from the south). So we get a supernatural thriller with romance and a cracking soundtrack too.I had a couple of problems with young girls being dished up this tosh about self-obsessed pale and sensitive male geniuses especially when Edward compares his love for Bella to a heroin addiction. This is not entirely innocuous brainwashing. But overall I succumbed to the palpable chemistry between the leads and remembered my own girlish fantasies with something of a head-spinning rush. Its not surprising then that the opening weekend of Twilight was the biggest for a female director in American history. But what is that a sign of exactly?

By David Denby Sean Penn as Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sants movie about the life and death of the gay-rights activist and politician.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko At the beginning of Gus Van Sants vibrantly entertaining bio-pic ""Milk"" Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) picks up a much younger man in the New York subway. Physically the two are far from equals Penns Milk is forty and short with a big schnoz and matted wedges of hair heading uneasily in different directions; Scott Smith played by James Franco is tall and slender with an angel face and a curly brown mane. But Smith is charmed by Milks self-deprecating humor and turned on by his ravenous need. Sighing Smith gives in and goes home with him. It is the first of Harvey Milks triumphs that we see. With Smith in tow he moves to San Francisco in 1972 and sets up a camera shop in the Castro district. He becomes locally famous as a gay activist and unofficial neighborhood fixer. He trades favors with the Teamsters arranging a boycott of Coors beer in gay bars when the brewery wont sign a contract with the union; in return the Teamsters allow openly gay men to drive beer-delivery trucks. In 1977 on his third try Milk is elected as a district supervisor (the equivalent of a city councilman in New York). He is at the height of his influence and possibly bound for the mayoralty. But in 1978 along with Mayor George Moscone he is shot and killed by a fellow-supervisor the family-values conservative Dan White (Josh Brolin). In making this movie Van Sant is forced to wrestle with the assorted pieties built into three high-minded genres not just the bio-pic but also the fallen-martyr saga and the social-protest statement. Working with the screenwriter Dustin Lance Black he includes archival footage from the nineteen-fifties and sixties of gays being arrested in bars and pushed into police vans. He uses news footage of Dianne Feinstein (then the head of the Board of Supervisors) announcing the murders. He devotes serious time to speeches and campaign strategizing. Van Sant wants to tell the political story accurately and in detail but ""Milk"" is anything but starchy. The righteous march of events is warmed by the banter the casual sex and the candor of the gay milieu of the giddy seventies the period just before AIDS when life was free and easy. Some sort of sexual mischief is almost always playing out around the edges of the action and at the center of the picture Milk comes across as an idiosyncratic man a rule-bound New York Jew who finds his calling in the beautiful and sensually relaxed Mediterranean-style city. The gay leader becomes a superb pol with a human-rights agenda and the movie offers a mildly subversive suggestion attracting the electorate is not all that different from picking up a young man in the subway. Charm persistence and articulate passion are required for both. Harvey Bernard Milk the son of Bill and Minnie Milk was born on Long Island in Woodmere in 1930. After graduating from SUNY Albany he joined the Navy became a chief petty officer during the Korean War and then took up the life of a cultivated closeted gay man in New York City. He worked as a research analyst at Bache amp; Co. lived on Central Park West and went to the opera; he carried on a series of monogamous affairs with men. His early life is no more than hinted at in the movie but his conservative background--he even supported Goldwater in 1964--is an essential part of his fascination as a character. This man was not by nature a troublemaker. Sidling into a room with a deferential smile and speaking in a soft slightly nasal Long Island accent Penn portrays Milk as a little shy at first. As an openly gay politician he is eager to please and to reassure. ""I left my high heels at home"" he tells a roomful of barrel-chested union men. Much of the time Penn keeps his voice down but the fervor and the humor are there in the most offhand moments. Without ostentation he creates a new body a new temperament he loosens up his neck and shoulders and swivels his head; his smile becomes enormous and all-embracing; he holds an elbow out and pumps a forearm up and down like a semaphore as Milk speaks in public. Habits of boldness come upon Milk gradually and then in a rush of joy defiantly. ""My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you"" becomes his declamatory signature line. Is there an actor in Hollywood braver than Sean Penn? In the recent past he has taken on parts so difficult that they bordered on the unplayable--the autistic man trying to hold on to his child in ""I Am Sam"" (2001) the enraged ex-con and avenging father in ""Mystic River"" (2003) the dying college professor in ""21 Grams"" (2003) the fantasy-driven loser in ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" (2004). After all these surly vicious and damaged men it is startling to see Penn for the first time in years playing a man who is happy--or at least happy in his public role. (His private life is a mess.) But happiness it turns out is the center of Milks agenda. He wants what straights take for granted the ability to live without shame. By casting a famously macho actor as Harvey Milk Van Sant has made the central humanist desire for self-acceptance and pride newly powerful. Giving himself utterly to the role Penn takes an actors craft and dedication to soulful heights making a demand for dignity that becomes universal. Long ago in 1991 before Van Sant directed such mainstream films as ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""To Die For"" he made a different kind of gay movie--""My Own Private Idaho"" with two young hustlers (Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix) wandering the West and noodling among the tenderloin drifters in downtown Portland. Almost abstract in its use of clouds mountains and vast open spaces ""Idaho"" was a dreamy vague picture; River Phoenixs character Mike was a narcoleptic and having sex with someone was about the only way he could stay awake. In ""Milk"" no one ever seems to sleep. Milk picks up some lost boys similar to Mike--Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch) a smart little street operator from Phoenix and Jack Lira (Diego Luna) an emotionally unstable Latino who becomes Milks lover after Scott Smith grows tired of the endless campaigning and walks out. But Van Sant sticking to the main story line maintains an upbeat tempo and a purposeful mood. Milk rouses a ragtag army of street boys and Harvard graduates--and a tough woman Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) who manages them all. With this band of irregulars he fights against the religious pop singer Anita Bryant who is going around the country with God and family in her back pocket calling for the reversal of gay-rights laws; and the grim California state senator John Briggs (Denis OHare) who sponsors a referendum--the notorious Proposition 6--to throw Californias gay teachers and their supporters out of work. ""Milk"" is a rowdy anthem of triumph brought to an abrupt halt by Milks personal tragedies and the unfathomable moral chaos of Dan White. Van Sant and Black are careful not to caricature the assassin. In another brilliant performance Josh Brolin a slab of hair lying low across his forehead gives White a brick-headed baffled manner a tormented neediness. Milk humors White but grimaces in distaste when hes not looking. He persuades himself that the handsome former cop and fireman is merely ""uneducated"" and can be turned into an ally but White senses his condescension and is hurt by it. Astonishingly he wants to be liked by Milk; in a party scene drunk he moves in close to him. In the filmmakers interpretation theres a suggestion of repressed homosexuality in Dan White which is a familiar liberal explanation of why seemingly straight men murder gays. Well never know and in any case Whites other victim Mayor Moscone was not gay. After serving only five years in prison White was released and less than two years later committed suicide. Harvey Milk laid many myths and fears to rest but there are some demons that in one form or another keep on destroying. Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart) a lovely self-possessed high-school junior moves to a new school in Washington State and sees in the cafeteria a tall inordinately pale boy Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) glowering at her. He wants her but he cannot give way to desire. Edward it turns out is a morally serious vampire thirsty yet ascetic and Isabella falls in love with him. ""Twilight"" the first movie adapted from Stephenie Meyers series of best-selling teen novels is going to be a big hit with young girls and deservedly so--the picture delivers. Edward and his ghoulish family consider themselves ""vegetarians"" they have vowed to drink only the blood of animals even though human blood gives them greater satisfaction. They live in a constant state of virtuous denial. In some ways the scrupulous Edward is an ideal lover after all many teen-age girls dont want intercourse; they want romance and here is a boy with superhuman powers who is nevertheless real sweet with his girl and protects her from harm without demanding anything but the chance to adore her. The director Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") oversees some special effects that look a little cheesy though the sunless Northwest thick with mountain forests is gloomily magnificent. Much of the time Hardwicke keeps the camera close to the chaste lovers. A genuine love story might be difficult for a young audience to handle but this fantasy is blissful madness--an abstinence fable sexier than sex.

Its the biochemistry angle. See the gorgeous vampire Edward is driven mad with desire by the high-school heroine Isabellas scent. She has just arrived in their remote Pacific Northwest town to live with her chief-of-police father. Edward smells her while theyre peering through a microscope and his eyes become a feral yellow-black; and she soon loves him hungrily too in her ordinary teenage raging-hormonal way which is powerful enough. But in this universe the vampires appetites cannot be controlled. One taste of her blood could trigger carnage on an operatic scale.Meyers prose is skimmable but her dialogue hits all the right beats; experiencing these two beautiful creatures enforced sexual suppression on the page made me feel like I was 17 again. But Twilight the movie is cautious a sort of Tiger Beatified Twin Peaks. In its undercooked way though its enjoyable. A lot of people have so much invested in its being the biggest hot-date movie since Titanic that theyll love it anyway and their reactions will be part of the show. At the screening I went to three rows of girls in the front shrieked at the entrance of Robert Pattinson and shrieked again when he locked eyes with Isabella (Kristen Stewart). Hes more my idea of a hunky Frankenstein Monster than a hunky vampire with six inches of hair above six inches of forehead above a foot of face in too obvious white greasepaint. But he matches up with Stewart who has a long face herself although rather less lipstick. He tilts his head down and rolls his eyeballs up soulfully and tries to convey the hopelessness of their situation. The emotion of these two is palpable except theyre in the throes of intimacy before their intimacy has even been established. I think youll need to read the book to pick up on all the vibes because the script by Melissa Rosenberg is barely functional. And even with the heroines narration the director Catherine Hardwicke doesnt bring us into Bellas head as shes observing Edward and his strange family of marbleized outsiders  his adopted parents and brothers and sisters. The idea that this pallid clan passes as human is a hoot; when Edwards father Carlisle a much-loved doctor strides into the hospital emergency room he looks ready to host a Monster Chiller Horror Theater marathon. Hardwicke jacks up the stakes with a swooping camera and a romantic-grunge soundtrack but the most vivid thing in the film is Kristen Stewart. She was the leggy hobo-camp teen in love with Emile Hirsch in Into the Wild and shes better at conveying physical longing than any of the actors playing vampires. She alone suggests how this series was born in the mind of a young Mormon girl who had to sublimate like mad with thoughts of having her blood sucked. Duncan Lance Black the screenwriter of the gay-rights activist Harvey Milk biopic Milk opening next week is also a Mormon and it makes me wonder With characters that veer between implosive sexual repression and explosive sexual liberation are Mormons the new Catholics? -- David Edelstein Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick Kanye West Wants Apple to Hurry Up and Buy Tidal Already 6 Things We Learned About HBOas New Series Insecure Teen Wolfs Tyler Posey Apologizes For His Fake Coming Out TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

"Twilight Love bites | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsTwilight Love bitesWondrous are the ways of vampires in Twilight  a tale of undead adoration where sharp teeth and cold hands are no impediment to romance.Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson convincingly portray the PG love between teen couple Bella and her vampire beau Edward.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 21 2008 Twilight (out of 4)Starring Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Billy Burke Peter Facinelli and Cam Gigandet. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke. 120 minutes. At major theatres. PG Wondrous are the ways of vampires in Twilight a tale of undead adoration where sharp teeth and cold hands are no impediment to romance.Even more mind-blowing is the supernatural hold this saga has on its predominately teen audience the bulk of the 25 million purchasers of the Stephenie Meyer novel that begat the phenomenon.Twilight is an anomaly in our sex-mad world. It preaches the virtues of celibacy of saving yourself for future pleasure while at the same time elevating the subject of your devotion to almost mystical status. Messages of abstinence rarely penetrate the minds of teens yet this one has them lining up. In literature class they call this neck-up amour courtly love and it began with knights wooing fair maidens. In the Twilight of current times its vampire boys chasing grunge girls and thats the genius of Meyers otherwise pedestrian book which director Catherine Hardwicke has ably served in her screen adaptation. Perhaps the most deserving kudos though are for scripter Melissa Rosenberg (Step Up TVs Dexter and The O.C.) who has wisely deep-sixed the novels first-person voice and overly lavender language. These are not your granddads vampires - or even your teenage brothers for that matter. These New Age neck nibblers walk in daylight (albeit the perpetually rainy burgh of Forks Wash.) drive SUVs sport sharp haircuts groove to Debussy and live in a glassy mountainside abode that is to die for. They call themselves the Cullen family led by dapper Dr. Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli) and like Greta Garbo they just want to be alone. The only real hell for the docs brood is having to move to a new town every few years enrolling a new in high school because they never physically age.Heres the really strange thing about the Cullens. Theyve nobly taught themselves not to drink human blood taking their nourishment instead from animals. (Fortunately no Fidos or Fluffys were sacrificed for this film.)""We think of ourselves as vegetarians"" says dreamboat Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) who gives new meaning to drop-dead good looks in a sexy mime kind of way. Edward should check a dictionary for the definition of ""vegetarian"" but hes even more confused by his sudden passion for human classmate Bella (Kristen Stewart) a pale thin beauty who would probably dress goth if there werent already so many vampires running around.Edward and Bella fall almost immediately in love after the usual pretend disinterest. But there is no backseat passion for these two. In true courtly love fashion they must resist most acts of physical affection lest Edwards restraint slip and Bella becomes lunch or turns into a vampire herself.Romantic to the bone Bella doesnt fear the bite of her illicit apple.""Im not afraid of you"" she tells him. ""Im only afraid of losing you."" Maybe its because her dad Charlie (a well-cast Billy Burke) is the towns police chief.Not every vampire in Forks is as well mannered as the Cullens. A visiting trio looking like a vampiric take on The Mod Squad is busily dining on lonely fishermen and security guards. The hungriest of the trio is James (Cam Gigandet) who takes a shine to Bella mainly because shed go well with a nice Chianti. Hes not alone - every adolescent male in town bays for Bella and that includes Jacob (Taylor Lautner) a Native American with a wolfish grin who will obviously play a bigger role in the inevitable sequels. Edward and his clan will be obliged to bare their fangs and muss their hair if they hope to protect Bella from threats and rivals. The action gets intense at points but theres not much of it and the camera discreetly blinks when the blood really starts to flow.Twilight is the Diet Coke of vampire movies but central to the films success is that you believe in the love between Edward and Bella. You want them to be together even if the heavy breathing never gets past first base. Pattinson and Stewart deliver the sexless sizzle like a stake through the heart.Hardwicke made her name with Thirteen a well-received 2003 film that plumbed the perils of early teenhood. With Twilight she exhibits a similar facility for the later teen years. She has launched a new vampire franchise that doesnt suck something courtly lovers everywhere can clasp to their unripped bodices.

Others neednt run. Or walk. ENLARGE Robert Pattinson The bleached-faced bloodsucker Edward Cullen attends high school in Forks a singularly gloomy little town in Washington state; hes played by the young English heartthrob-in-the -making Robert Pattinson. Edward first meets his inamorata Bella (Kristen Stewart) when she moves to Forks where her father is police chief from her mothers house in Phoenix where she had managed fatefully to avoid getting a tan. In a film that has the courage of its absurdity but not much else Mr. Pattinson gets the best of what passes for style. Hes been fitted out with an upswept rats-nest hairdo along with a thin coat of clown-white makeup and photographed with special attention to his cantilevered brows and his gift for growing a gaze into a glare or when the occasion demands it a leer. Ms. Stewart on the other hand hasnt been directed so much as permitted or maybe incited to indicate anxiety by spitting out her lines in a rat-tat-tat that can be borderline unintelligible. ENLARGE Kristen Stewart as Bella left and Robert Pattinson as Edward in Twilight. Summit Entertainment Not that ""Twilights"" fate hangs on intelligibility. It hangs on fangs that arent bared and on a bloodlust that isnt indulged. Edward is as he explains to Bella patiently the vampire equivalent of a vegetarian. Like ordinary people living on tofu he and his family restrict their diet to animal blood though they still consider the human variety a treat to die for. Indeed the movie pushes undead abstinence while its director Catherine Hardwicke indulges in klutzy extravagance that misfires as often as it fires -- a Cullen family baseball game is to howl at -- and gets little blood pounding until the climax when Edward clashes with the slavering scion of a carnivorous vampire family in some no-tofu kung fu for the custody of Bellas soul. ""Twilight"" has targeted the collective soul of teenage America and will surely have its way. Bolt I saw ""Bolt"" Disneys 3-D animated feature about a movie dog who mistakenly thinks he has superpowers only an hour after leaving my own dog Skeezix at a boarding kennel for a weeks stay. Skeezix has no such illusions to protect him -- hes just a lovable little guy who thinks regular dog thoughts -- so my heart was heavy with regret that may have skewed my response to the movie. I did not find ""Bolt"" lovable. Likable yes and occasionally endearing -- yet the best parts involve a hamster in a plastic ball. The movie dogs confusions are entertaining though theyre familiar to anyone who has seen Buzz Lightyear in Pixars peerless ""Toy Story"" films. But the spunk of the hamster a corpulent rodent named Rhino is stirring and theres a timeless purity to the spectacle of him scurrying around in his private little sphere. Taken on its own terms ""Bolt"" the movie certainly makes the cut. In his role as the action hero of a popular TV show Bolt the canine -- a white rescue dog voiced by John Travolta -- is all but omnipotent. (Miley Cyrus provides the voice of his co-star and owner a girl named Penny.) But the mail room accidentally packs him in Styrofoam peanuts and ships him to New York where hes thrown on his own severely limited resources. (The poor pooch doesnt even know how to beg until he gets amusing lessons from a street-smart cat named Mittens.) The plot such as it is has Rhino voiced by Mark Walton and Mittens (Susie Essman) helping Bolt to get back to Hollywood and his beloved Penny and coming to understand that true heroism doesnt depend on special powers. ENLARGE Bolt voiced by John Travolta Walt Disney Studios The 3-D process is an enhancement even though its used with little verve or ingenuity. But the movies terms are severely limited too. ""Bolt"" is yet another entertainment fascinated by the entertainment industry with knowing references to agents writers directors ratings and the like. This wont damage our kiddies delicate minds but it wont fire their imaginations either. Mine was warmed if not fired by simpler things such as Bolt sticking his head out the window of a mobile home in transit and rediscovering the joy of the wind. Let the Right One In By happy happenstance a remarkably fine and genuinely frightening movie about a teenage vampire is playing in a dozen or more cities around the country. ""Let the Right One In"" in Swedish with English subtitles was directed by Tomas Alfredson from John Ajvide Lindqvists adaptation of his own novel. This time the genders are reversed -- the vampire takes the form of a dark-eyed girl. Her name is Eli and she moves into a suburban apartment with a stone-faced man who only looks to be her father. At first Eli has evil eyes for Oskar the boy next door; he looks like an angel and lives in a hell created by school bullies. But she falls in love in her fashion and becomes the boys protector. ENLARGE Kare Hedebrant (center) in Let the Right One In. Magnet Releasing See a scene from Let the Right One In. See a scene from Ballast. Mr. Alfredsons style is as elegant and laconic as ""Twilight"" is amateurish and campy. The cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema has created formal compositions muted in tone that I will savor as still frames when the DVD is released. The film has its share of sly humor. At one point Eli her face smeared with a victims blood snuggles with Oskar in bed and tells him shes not really a girl but he still wants to go steady. Yet the main dramatic tone is quiet horror grounded in a matter-of-factness that will have your blood running cold. Ballast In the recent flood tide of releases I missed another elegantly uncluttered little movie -- little only in the scale of its production budget -- called ""Ballast."" A debut feature by Lance Hammer its a deceptively leisurely account of tragedy and reconciliation in a Mississippi delta family. At the center of it all is Lawrence a large deliberate man played by Micheal J. Smith Sr. (Mr. Hammer has used only nonprofessionals in his cast and used them brilliantly.) When his twin brother kills himself Lawrence grows despondent his nephew goes out of control and the familys already tattered fabric starts to unravel. ENLARGE Micheal J. Smith Sr. in Ballast Alluvial Film Co. That makes the movie sound more eventful than it is. For the most part the story moves at the ambling pace of uncertain lives a pace representing the filmmakers trust that his audience will stay involved as several important events unfold. His trust is justified by his talent. This ostensibly simple film evokes whole lives in 96 minutes and does so with sparse dialogue. Its about sorrow addiction the secret life of a child an incipient fall from the slippery decks of respectability and the moral and material ballast that keeps a family afloat. Its even about twins. The brother who dies takes some of Lawrence with him. DVD TIP Lets be seriously film-scholarly here. Carl Theodor Dreyers ""Vampyr"" (1932) is one of the landmark horror films in film history and it has recently been remastered and released in a Criterion version that does full justice to its visual splendor. ""Vampyr"" is mostly silent and entirely hypnotic. The cinematographer was Rudolph Mate who went on to a long and distinguished career in Hollywood. (He shot ""Gilda"" starring the entirely gorgeous Rita Hayworth.) Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Find TV listings at LocateTV.

At least its easy judging by the movie based on the book which opens appropriately enough just after midnight tonight.

Gorgeous -- and quite literally shiny -- to look at Edward is a consummate gentleman on the outside a seething caldron of animal desire on the inside. ""Ive never wanted a humans blood so much in my life"" he tells Bella in the first of many nostril-flaringly sexy double-entendres. And yet he remains tantalizingly just out of reach. Or so it seems. Thats because Edward as part of a coven of self-proclaimed ""vegetarian"" vampires refuses to drink human blood surviving only on the far-less-satisfying woodland creatures that roam at their peril the fog-shrouded forests surrounding the picturesque Pacific Northwest town where he and Bella live. Edward knows that if things were to get too hot and heavy with Bella it might end badly for her. ""I cant ever lose control with you"" he tells her in the films one exquisitely unrequited bedroom scene which barely progresses beyond a kiss. What more could an underage girl want than to be adored without any of the messy complications of an actual physical relationship? Oh and that town where Bella and Edward live? Its called Forks. The name of the sports teams at Bella and Edwards school? The Spartans. Thats just in case you missed the subtext of hunger and fasting as a metaphor for sex and abstinence. Yes lust is the elephant in the room here and its what gives ""Twilight"" its decidedly grown-up bite broadening its appeal beyond the demographic of Hot Topic shoppers. That and director Catherine Hardwickes wry self-referential sense of humor. Its most evident in a meet-the-parents scene in which Bella is invited by Edward to the Cullen house for dinner. ""Youve given us a chance to use the kitchen for the first time"" cracks a smiling Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli) the family patriarch and chief proponent of its abstinence-only philosophy. In a wonderfully ironic touch he holds down a day job as an emergency room surgeon. Other members of the clan are less welcoming lending a delicious tension to the gathering. Only a family outing in which Bella watches the Cullens play a kind of superhuman baseball dashing through the woods like Sonic the Hedgehog and other preternaturally endowed cartoon characters seems a goofy miscalculation in tone. Of course like any self-respecting vampire movie ""Twilight"" is also pretty scary. A roving band of out-of-town vampires who dont observe the Cullens dietary restrictions soon shows up. One of them James (Cam Gigandet) becomes as obsessed with Bella as Edward is -- albeit for less starry-eyed reasons -- leading to the films climactic and photogenic showdown in a darkened mirror-lined ballet studio. Good stuff. Now for the quibbles. On the level of special effects ""Twilight"" is something of a disappointment. On-screen for instance the Cullen familys impossibly white skin looks less like natural -- even er unnatural -- pallor than like face paint. The vampires resemble a family of Edward Scissorhandses without the scissors all wild hair slightly Goth-y clothing and clown-white pancake makeup. Its especially jarring in contrast to James and his vampire consort Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre) who look to be in the pink. Is that what drinking blood from deer and chipmunks does to you? My God Edward eat a hamburger. I never quite bought Edwards extraordinary running jumping and tree-climbing ability either. Hardwick relies too much on motion blur a cheat that looks oddly dated given the F/X capabilities evident in say the ""Spider-Man"" movies. And the scene in which Edward reveals what his skin looks like -- like diamonds according to Meyer -- is frustratingly vague. ""This is what I really look like"" he says stepping out of the constant fog into a rare shaft of sunlight. What? Out of focus? But these are minor complaints. On the whole ""Twilight"" works as both love story and vampire story thanks mainly to the performances of its principals. Pattinson and Stewart want to convince you that their characters are an undead freak and the girl who against all logic loves him. Yet they do it not by selling you on what makes Edward and Bella so different but by finding their flesh-and-blood humanity. Its enough to make even a grown man eager for the inevitable sequel. Twilight (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence and a scene of sensuality. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Time for a Vampire Weekend More Reviews in DVD Section Recently released on DVD and Blu-ray Coming to DVD and Blu-ray Twilight A Tasty Bite Of Vampire Romance A Boy and His Ghoulfriend Beyond the Genre A Vampires Life?

Its quite another to lose to Toronto the team with the worst record. And thats exactly what happened to the Nets in the last two games. After being beaten by Detroit on Wednesday the Nets all said there were positive signs reason to be upbeat. After losing last night to Toronto which entered at 2-15 last night the Nets had every reason to stick their heads in a microwave. Remember all those good feelings from earlier this week? Gone. But Richard Jefferson insists the Nets can get them back. ""Ive been here a long time and we always come out on top. Somehow and some way we always figure out a way to be successful. And we will figure it out"" said Jefferson who then cast a hint of doubt. ""Will we get it in time to be the team that we want to be a 50-some win team? I hope so. If not were going to be right in the middle of things be a fifth seed maybe a sixth seed stumble into the playoffs. Well find out.""  It was the first time Toronto won on consecutive road nights since April 7-8 2000. . . . Jason Collins shot 1-of-2 from the foul line 50 percent. And his season mark went up to .429. ""I dont know why"" Collins a .716 lifetime free-throw shooter said of his poor effort. ""I started off 2-for-12 on the road so theres a lot of work to make up. I will say six of those were with seven stitches in my eye [at Miami from a hit by Udonis Haslem].  Jeff McInnis whose minutes have yo-yoed with his play is asking coach Lawrence Frank for a longer leash. ""As a starter I used to get a chance to struggle a bit and have a good game"" said McInnis. ""So the only thing I tell coach is If I come out and miss a couple shots stay with me. Dont give up on me because in the fourth quarter I can make a play or two. "" Frank had little reaction to a story in Utah in which Gordie Chiesa said he quit Nets staff because he had no input. ""All Ill say is Gordies a great guy"" Frank said.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday November 20 2008 508 PM As the credits came up at a recent screening of ""Twilight"" I heard a deep sigh to my right. It was my 15-year-old date Libby. ""I had such high expectations"" she mumbled. And thats a problem director Catherine Hardwicke is likely to encounter with girls all over America (and beyond) Stephenie Meyers young adult novel is so beloved its much easier to see what went wrong with Hardwickes adaptation than what she got right. RELATED STORY TWILIGHT TICKETS SELLING OUT FASTFrankly Libbys opinion matters a lot more than mine here; grownups arent going to propel this movie to the top of the box-office charts. And her biggest disappointment was in the all-important casting. As every female under the age of 20 already knows Kristen Stewart was hired to play Bella Swan an ugly-duckling teen who moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington State to live with her dad (Billy Burke). PHOTOS SEXY VAMPIRES ON FILMAlmost immediately she connects with the schools gorgeous loner Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) who only hangs out with his equally beautiful and odd siblings. Before long Bella learns Edwards big secret Hes a vampire who simultaneously wants to kill her and kiss her. Which makes him of course the ultimate bad boy. And entirely irresistible to our smitten heroine. PHOTOS VAMPIRES THROUGH THE AGESUnfortunately the actors dont seem to have nearly as much invested in the story as Hardwickes target audience will. Stewart does play up Bellas feistiness but she feels much more mature and secure than the character we already know. As for Pattinson Libbys critical assessment is as accurate as any ""Hes really cute but so not a good actor."" Echoing my thoughts exactly she turned in frustration during one typically stilted attempt at smoldering sexiness and whispered ""But why did they choose him?"" Its disappointing when a big-screen romance cant match up to the one in your imagination at any age. But at least the story surrounding this one remains generally unshaken. Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg does a decent job adapting the first book in Meyers series and despite a tendency toward cheesy effects Hardwicke keeps things moving swiftly. Besides Bella and Edward have survived far worse than lousy casting and teenage girls can be remarkably forgiving under the right circumstances. Just ask Libby Shes already planning on seeing ""Twilight"" again tonight. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Twilight (PG-13) 1/2 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Twilight (PG-13) 1/2 Those blood-curdling screams are pure delight. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson star in the thriller Twilight a Summit Entertainment release. Share Print Save to your profile By Sara Frederick The Miami Herald Note to mothers and teenage boyfriends accompanying Twilight fans to the theater Bring earplugs. Youll want to protect your hearing from the shrieks and screams coming from teenage girls. And there will be screams each time a beloved character from the first novel in Stephenie Meyers bestselling young-adult series appears for the first time; each time a particularly juicy line of dialogue from the book is recalled; and each time the storys star-crossed lovers touch. In one of the most anticipated novel-turned-movie to hit the screen since the Harry Potter franchise Twilight centers on Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) a 17-year-old from Phoenix who moves to a tiny rain-soaked town in Washington to live with her father after her mother remarries. Once there she falls in love with the beautiful but moody Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Edward is a vampire though not one who adheres to traditional mythology. Sure they live forever and feed on blood but Twilights monsters have no fangs. They dont disintegrate in the daylight and a stake through the heart probably wouldnt kill them. But even in this vampire world the Cullen family is different They feed as vegetarians drinking the blood of animals to spare human lives. While Bella is immediately attracted to Edward because of the mystery surrounding his family -- five extremely attractive teenagers living with an extremely young set of foster parents -- Edward is drawn to Bella because of the potent scent of her blood which is sweeter to him than anyone elses. The fact that his special mind-reading ability doesnt work on her only intrigues him further. Bella takes awhile to figure out what exactly is different about Edward. Hearing an old Indian legend from her childhood playmate Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner who gets little screen time but will have a much bigger role if sequels are made) points her in the right direction. Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg speeds up the budding love story between Edward and Bella to give the couple more time together on screen which thoroughly pleased the teenage audience at a preview showing. Rosenberg also borrows lines directly from Midnight SunMeyers excellent but half-finished telling of Twilight from Edwards point of view that was leaked onto the Internet this summer. (Note to Meyer Please please finish this.) But the movies Cullens are never menacing enough. Their classmates arent put off by the standoffish pale-faced vampires. Instead they gaze at them in the awe-inspired way dorks in high-school movies look at the homecoming queen and quarterback. Pattinson known mostly for his pivotal role in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fireattempts a couple of dark tortured expressions but comes across more ridiculous than scary. When he meets Bella in biology lab he shrinks back almost violently in his seat and actually holds his nose leading Bella to sniff her hair to see if somethings wrong. The scene is over-acted and unintentionally hilarious. As Bella Stewart (In the Land of Women) is a little stiff and over-confident a weird combination. Shes also funny. When Edward appears in her front yard out of nowhere Bella chastises him ``Can you act human? I have neighbors In a move that will keep nonreaders more entertained director Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen) has made her film a cross between a love story and thriller. The novel is decidedly a romance with a bit of action tossed in at the end but the movie spends more time on the normal vampires -- the bloodsuckers that feast on humans -- who are killing townspeople and eventually pursue Bella. That pursuit follows one of the best scenes in the movie in which the Cullens play a game of baseball during a storm their superhuman strength making the crack of the bat against the ball as loud as thunder. The vampires speed at fielding the ball reminds you of the Quidditch matches in the Potter series. But the game comes to an end when the killer vamps make an appearance and catch a whiff of Bella. The fight youre expecting takes place and the movie ends with a big opening for a sequel. And there should be one. None of the movies flaws will matter. Teenage girls are going to love Twilightand many are sure to see it more than once. Hang on to those earplugs This time next year youll need them again.

Edwards (Robert Pattinson) love for Bella (Kristen Stewart) outweighs his urge to bite her and suck her dry thanks to a strong conscience and his coven?s unusual practice of abstaining from human blood. Photo Peter Sorel Twilight 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Does it matter what I say? Does it matter what any critic says about Twilight? Ummmm ... no. Among the hordes of pubescent fangirls in line to see Catherine Hardwickes long-awaited vampire-on-human romance not a one cares a fang what I think of it. I know this because I have already forced my opinion on two adolescent girls of my acquaintance and their response was Right Mom. (Pause.) Were seeing it on Friday. Just because I happened to find Twilight uneven overbaked and more than a little goofy doesnt mean the nations vast scrunchy demographic will suddenly run off to The Duchess instead. Still the multitudes should consider themselves warned. Listen to the old lady gals The movies not that good. I do know my Quileutes from my Cullens. Ive consumed all four novels in Stephenie Meyers crazy-popular YA series and I cant blame my daughters for the decision to read in toto 2457 pages. Free will was involved. And the truth is the first three books are wildly addictive seducing readers with a lively mortal narrator -- that would be 17-year-old Bella Swan the new kid in Forks Wash. -- and her affair de coeur with an immortal and anemically beautiful vampire. His name is Edward Cullen and he is one hunky bloodsucker a super-strong super-fast super-chivalrous mind-reader who glitters in sunlight and pines for the yummy-smelling Bella. Fortunately his love for her outweighs his urge to bite her and suck her dry thanks to a strong conscience and his covens unusual practice of abstaining from human blood. (Man cannot live on bread alone but vampires in the Pacific Northwest seem to do pretty well on game.) Two questions haunt the Bella-Edward saga. One is ""Will Bella and Edward do it?"" And the other is ""Will Bella become a vampire?"" Hardwicke working from Melissa Rosenbergs screenplay barely scratches the surface of these very burning issues. But she gets a couple things right; from Thirteen through The Nativity Story shes displayed a fascination with the distressed teen psyche and she does a crack job casting it in Twilight. Kristen Stewart scores as Bella -- a smart and self-deprecating klutz caught up in a morbid story arc. (""Dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go"" quoth a bit of bummer narration.) Her co-star is Robert Pattinson who played the brave doomed Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and now plays the even braver even more doomed Edward. Pattinson certainly can glower. He certainly is handsome. His chemistry with Kristen Stewart certainly makes for a virginal orgy of tormented glances and locked lips. Whats more with a judicious application of hair gel he strikes an eerie resemblance to Christopher Walken in The Dead Zone. Twilight goes a tad heavy on the beauty products. At the screening I attended the audience burst into awkward giggles at the first sight of Peter Facinelli as Carlisle Cullen Edwards vampire ""father"" who wears such a thick schmear of ghoulish white face-paint he looks like he crashed into a bagel. (The crowd burst into more giggles near the end at a moment of crucial moral reckoning.) The movie lays it on thick in other areas too unleashing a near-constant barrage of music (Linkin Park Perry Farrell even Pattinsons on the soundtrack) and one too many close-ups of suffering vampire eyeballs. Gothic wooziness stifles many of Hardwickes lighter impulses such as her knack for jiving humor in scenes among friends and family. And some of the more cartoonishly gymnastic CG stunts look plain silly. Rosenbergs script stays true enough to the book given its length chattiness and purply overstatement. A few characters get short shrift especially Bellas Native American buddy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) wholl grow in importance as the sequels pile up. And pile up they will. The hordes will demand it no matter how the critics whine. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

Comments Twilight A dirgelike Hungarian ""thriller"" by Gyorgy Feher about the search for a serial killer whose victims are little girls. The striking visual style (high-contrast black-and-white cinematography by Miklos Gurban) and creepy pacing tend to dominate the plot so thoroughly that I found myself tuning the narrative out and not being terribly worried about what I was missing. While the slow-as-molasses dialogue delivery and camera movements superficially suggest Tarkovsky (or closer to home Bela Tarrs Damnation) Fehers script and mise en scene are considerably more mannerist--employed more to conjure an atmosphere than to convey a particular vision or a distinctive moral universe. The closest American equivalent to this sort of exercise might be Rumble Fish sumptuous visuals that impart more filigree than substance (1990).

And despite questionable casting wooden acting laughable dialogue and truly awful makeup nothing is likely to stop young girls from swarming to this kitschy adaptation of Stephenie Meyers popular novel. All the girls at his high school agree Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) is a hottie. But theres something strange about him and his siblings. Ultra-pale and icy to the touch the five Cullen teens foster children of Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) and Esme (Elizabeth Reaser) tend to keep to themselves. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is the teenage daughter of Charlie (Billy Burke) the police chief of Forks. She has just moved to the rainy town. Bella is mesmerized by the handsome mysterious Edward and the two soon fall in love. When she learns he is one of the undead Bella is only more intrigued. So what if he has been 17 since the early 1900s? Director Catherine Hardwicke (The Nativity Story) relies heavily on extreme close-ups to make up for her lead actors lack of emotional range. When the camera isnt trained tightly on their eyes and mouths its swirling around them. Stewart and Pattinson lack chemistry. Her subtle acting does not serve her well in this overheated setting. As Bella she seems to have two expressions blank and slightly less blank. Pattinsons native English accent comes through at inopportune moments. Meyer is said to have been involved in the production of Twilight but her novel was substantially more absorbing than the unintentionally funny and quickly forgettable film. (Rated PG-13 for some violence and a scene of sensuality. Running time 2 hours 2 minutes. Opens tonight in select theaters and Friday nationwide.)

And if that line echoes a famous one from The Wizard of Oz well so be it because in Twilight - the surefire hit adaptation of the first book from Stephenie Meyers mega-selling saga - Bella Swann like Dorothy Gale is in for the ride of her life.A pheromone-drenched high school romance rife with heavy-duty Dracula stuff Twilight - directed with savvy humor by Catherine Hardwicke - turns vampirism into a metaphor for teen lust.When Bella (a soulful scrutinizing Kristen Stewart) takes one look across the school cafeteria at the lush-lipped Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) sirens go off in her head. And the feeling is mutual Lab partners in biology class Edward cant control his attraction to Bella. Its biology but its chemistry too She emits a scent that vampire dudes inhale with urgency. Sitting next to her is driving him wild. Literally.Bella is in Forks (just down the road from Twin Peaks Ill wager) because her parents are divorced. Her mother with whom she lived in Arizona is traveling with her new husband. And Dad (Billy Burke) the town police chief is glad in his taciturn way to have his daughter home. Theres a period of adjustment - entering high school midway through the semester she has no clique to call her own. But thats OK; Bella with her iPod and her books likes to keep to herself.Until she meets Edward that is and suddenly her dreams are full of his lurking likeness. When a kids car almost crushes Bella in the school parking lot Edward on the far side of the lot is there in a flash - stopping the oncoming vehicle with a superheroic outstretched arm.There are jokes about radioactive spiders and kryptonite but then Bella is on the laptop Googling vampires. She has sussed him out his cold skin his speed his strength. But Edward and his family a clan of pale-skinned stunners who live in a dazzling glass house in the mist-shrouded woods arent your typical bloodsuckers. They stick to animals and leave the humans alone. Edwards father Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli) is in fact the town doctor.Twilight manages the neat feat of radiating sexual heat at the same time that its pair of young lovers (well shes young - hes been 17 for centuries) must remain ridiculously chaste. Even an innocent kiss could be lethal - or lead to a painful immortality.Hardwicke who showed a keen affinity for the female adolescent mind-set in Thirteen (and directed the teen skateboarding pic Lords of Dogtown) goes close-up on Stewart and Pattinson countless times. Chins aquiver eyes shooting rockets at each other its about as intense a series of onscreen clinches as the movies have seen in ages. And amazingly it feels real - the actors pull it off.Twilight is a bit like the Harry Potters sexed-up and set in the (kind of) real world. Misfit kids mess around with the supernatural (Twilight even substitutes a Quidditch match with a thunderstorm baseball session) and certainly theres the promise of a Potter-scale screen franchise.Stewart Pattinson and company should get cracking on Twilights 2 and 3 while theyre young enough to plausibly play high school (Stewarts 18; Pattinson who was the doomed Cedric Diggory in two Harry Potters is 22).There is of course a prom moment in Twilight - just after the flying battle between Edward and a rogue vampire who has the hots for Bella. And then Hardwicke sets up the sequel with an ominous appearance from a wicked vampiress descending the stairs at the prom looking hot - and venomous.Twilight  (out of four stars)Directed by Catherine Hardwicke.

"Twilight | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; twilight ) Twilight (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli In a statement that borders on the obvious this review is not being written for the legions of loyal fans who have made Stephanie Meyers novel Twilight the most popular piece of young adult literature to come along since Harry Potter left Hogwarts. Undoubtedly Catherine Hardwickes film adaptation of the book will be met in those quarters with rapturous praise. But just because the fans love something doesnt mean its a good movie. Die-hards are often on the other side of the fence from those who view a particular nugget of pop culture from a distance and thats fine. Just keep in mind where this review is coming from. Twilight isnt an especially good movie but neither is it an abomination. At times the dialogue is laugh-aloud bad - almost to the point of being hilarious - and some of the acting is reminiscent of what we saw taking center stage in George Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy. The pace is uneven there are an abundance of secondary characters who serve no real purpose (presumably their existence will have a point in future installments) and there are a few scenes that drag on too long. Nevertheless as the momentum builds and the romantic melodrama soars to a crescendo its hard not to be entertained - at least a little bit - by whats transpiring. This is a Harlequin romance by way of Dark Shadows. If it was a little better made and more tightly plotted it might satisfy the requirements of a guilty pleasure. For a teenager one of the hardest life changes is to be transferred to a new school in the middle of a grade especially if that grade is in high school. Such is the unenviable situation of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) who has moved from Phoenix to the small Washington State town of Forks in the midst of her junior year. Her new school isnt a bad place. Despite the small size of the student body it has all the usual cliques jocks nerds outcasts and Goths. The final group is unusual in that its not comprised of Marilyn Manson lookalikes but real-life vampires. Of course no one knows that. One suspects that if such a thing became public knowledge it would be grounds for expulsion - or at least a few detentions. Bella is immediately attracted to Edward (Robert Pattinson) a stud who looks like a young Brendan Frasier cops a James Dean attitude and is as stiff as Hayden Christensens interpretation of Anakin Skywalker. The two get off to a rocky start but eventually they bond make out and go tree climbing. Its all very cute and PG-13 romantic but theres also a lot of angst. Edward advises Bella to stay away from him because he might lose control and do things one shouldnt do to ones potential prom date. (Ah the sexual double entendres that pervade this movie.) This just elevates Bellas level of interest. Youd think she wants to be eaten. Ultimately theres no sex but there is some biting. It turns out that Edward and his ""family"" arent into human snacks. Theyre ""vegetarians."" That doesnt apply to all vampires however as Bella discovers when a nasty piece of work named James (Cam Gigandet) gets a nostrils-full of her delicious scent. Call me old school but I get irritated when authors decide to re-write the vampire rule book to suit their desires. And making them dark and brooding doesnt make them interesting just kind of pathetic. Meyers vision of the undead is that they dont have any fatal problems with sunlight (they sparkle but dont burst into flame and shrivel up) and crucifixes and holy water dont pose a problem. Nor apparently do stakes through the heart - since killing requires that they be torn to pieces and torched. Whats left? Well they drink blood and can scamper around like bats and rats. Theyre super-fast and super-strong and they have ice-cold skin. This proves not to be a problem for Bella who happily cuddles with a man whose flesh is refrigerated. It takes an inordinate amount of time for Twilight to hit its stride. It stumbles along for the better part of an hour introducing secondary characters who serve no purpose and having Bella and Edward trade bad dialogue and they gaze longingly at one another. Who needs to touch when one has those looks? If a viewer wanted to scratch just beneath the surface its possible to view the human/vampire romance as an analog for a more traditional forbidden love story. But bloodsuckers are so much more interesting anyway. Kristen Stewart who may be familiar to some viewers from appearances in In the Land of Women and Into the Wild acquits herself admirably managing to avoid becoming stuck in the copious amounts of cheese that surround her. She brings a seriousness to Bella that works because she plays the role absolutely straight. We believe her because she sells the character. The same cannot be said of her male co-star. Robert Pattinson was clearly chosen more for his looks than his acting ability. There is some chemistry between the leads but its not explosive - more like a slow burn thats still trying to catch fire when the end credits role. No one else in the film merits mention. There are a lot of characters but aside from Bella and Edward none leaves much of an impression. Arguably the most fascinating thing about Twilight are the bits and pieces of vampire culture to which we are exposed although Im still trying to figure out why vampires only play baseball during thunderstorms. Im sure this like many things is better explored in the book. In fact for a non-convert to the Gospel According to Stephanie Meyer the movie often comes across like it was made for a club of which Im not a member. In other words if you really want to be pulled into Twilight you have to read the book. Heres a better idea for those interested in exploring juvenile vampire love on the big screen try out the Swedish movie Let the Right One In. It lacks Twilights pedigree and budget but what it loses in popularity it makes up for in atmosphere characterization and story. Twilight is for girls who have outgrown The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants but arent quite old enough for Sex and the City and that represents a potentially significant box office power. If its muscles are flexed we can expect three more of these movies. Hopefully like the Harry Potter films theyll get better as they go along.

"Twilight reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Twilight reviewed. Twilight reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 20 2008 1220 PM Twilight Cute vegetarian vampires in the Pacific Northwest. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Twilight click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in Twilight The paperback cover of Twilight the first of four best-selling teen-vampire fantasy novels by Stephenie Meyer shows a pair of pale female hands in close-up proffering the reader an obscurely menacing apple. I havent been able to make it through that books 500-plus pages of turgid vampire-ogling. (""He lay perfectly still in the grass his shirt open over his sculpted incandescent chest his scintillating arms bare. His glistening pale lavender lids were shut though of course he didnt sleep."") But after seeing director Catherine Hardwickes flawed yet transfixing adaptation of the book I can understand the appeal of that poisoned apple and I think I might want another bite. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The feminist critique of the Twilight phenomenon (see this astute reading by Laura Miller in Salon) points quite rightly to all thats reprehensible about the Twilight universe the heroines passivity and masochism her utter lack of grrl-power spunk. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is the anti-Buffy; shes a mortal high-school girl committed not to slaying vampires but to being slain by them. Make that one particular vampire Bellas highest ambition is to be snacked upon by the lavender-lidded incandescent-chested Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and thus to join him forever in the realm of the permanently teenage dead. As the movie begins Bella has just relocated from Phoenix to the remote rain-soaked town of Forks Wash. where shes moved in with her father (Billy Burke) the small towns taciturn chief of police. Her new lab partner Edward spends his days glaring at her with Morrissey-like intensity then suddenly saves her from an impending car crash with what seems like inhuman strength and speed then returns to insulting and ignoring her. Whats going on with Edward and his four impossibly attractive foster siblings? They never seem to eat or sleep and they fraternize only with one another floating through the school day in a pale silent pack. Oh and in an apparently unrelated development Bellas dad is investigating some mysterious deaths outside of town--its almost as if people were being eaten by some strange bloodthirsty animal. ... Advertisement This early part of the movie in which we wait for Bella to discover what any consumer of pop horror already knows is static and at times unintentionally funny. Pattinson a British actor chosen for his sculpted face and gazellelike physique doesnt seem to have been given much direction beyond ""melt the camera with your eyes."" But despite his studied gaze the lens remains stubbornly at room temperature and this opening act could have been cut by half an hour. What finally convinces Bella isnt the weeks of glaring but a few minutes of Googling The Cullens she realizes are a family of ""vegetarian"" vampires forcing themselves to subsist on animal blood as they chastely coexist with delicious delicious humans. Bellas blood is especially tempting to Edward for some reason--who can explain the vicissitudes of young love?--and hes been keeping his distance all this time for her safety. But when Edward confides his secret and starts spiriting Bella to the tops of giant pines for moony dream dates the movie takes on a pulp immediacy that somehow draws you in even if century-old guys with ice-cold glittering skin are totally not your type. The director Hardwicke began her career as a production designer and that shows in the convincing texture and detail of the world shes created. The Pacific Northwest locations (with Oregon standing in for Washington) are eerily lovely and the understated costume design by Wendy Chuck manages to make weatherproof parkas look Goth. Bellas schoolmates--the nonvampiric ones--are convincingly sketched characters vulnerable and goofy like real high-school kids rather than readymade archetypes. Hardwicke whose first film was the harrowing mother-daughter melodrama Thirteen (2003) has a keen sense memory for female adolescence--not just the social insecurity of that time but the grandiosity that can make self-destructive decisions feel somehow divinely fated. Unwholesome sure but arguably no more so than Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre two better-written Gothic romances about young women in thrall to a remote charismatic often cruel hero. And while Pattinsons Edward is a bit of a vain prig no one youd want to risk your immortal soul for his worthiness doesnt really matter. Twilight is a story about pining for the one person you can and should never have and who among us hasnt at least once experienced that vampiric craving? As a life lesson for teenage girls Twilight (excuse the pun) sucks. As a parable for the dark side of female desire its weirdly powerful.

Fans of the books will swoon at the sight of Robert Pattinson who plays Edward Cullen the soulful vampire with whom Bella (Kristen Stewart) falls in love. (They did just that in fact at a screening of the film cheering when Pattinson made his first appearance on-screen.) Director Catherine Hardwicke uses locations in the Pacific Northwest to great effect; some of the panoramic shots are stunning. But once the characters start talking. . . . The dialogue is so wooden you could use it to stake a vampires heart. There is an intriguing story here about outsiders finding acceptance as well as nods toward adolescent sexual frustration but those elements are largely glossed over. Too bad - high school can be as scary a place as any vampires lair a fact that the television version (not the film) of Buffy the Vampire Slayer proved time and again using monsters as metaphors to portray the very real horrors of growing up. Twilight is not as sophisticated seemingly deliberately so. Melissa Rosenbergs script instead takes aim at the teenage-romance crowd playing to its heart if not always its head. After her mother remarries Bella moves from Phoenix to the small town of Forks Wash. a rainy gloomy town of a little more than 3000 people. Fitting in might be tough youd think but several students immediately befriend her. She could be quite popular in fact but she resists it. Instead shes intrigued by the Cullen family particularly Edward. Disagreeable lab partners at first they obviously have feelings for each other and soon fall in love. This is complicated of course by the fact that Edward and his family are vampires. But theyre good vampires drinking only the blood of animals. Not all vampires are so noble; a marauding band of bloodsuckers - you can tell theyre bad because unlike the Cullens theyre unkempt - is on the loose killing humans. Nothing much comes of that thread because soon they have their sights and their fangs set on Bella. Its up to Edward and his family providing a form of stability that Bellas real family cannot to protect her. Stewart is a fine actress but too often here when she is supposed to appear brooding and aloof she just seems bored. Pattinson meanwhile isnt particularly convincing and his chemistry with Stewart doesnt quite make for the timeless romantic bond that it might have. Both risk much for love - he risks discovery by revealing the family secret to her and she risks well becoming dinner. There are glimpses of how that might have worked better - in the scene where Edward first admits what he is to Bella for instance. But thats undercut by an awkward sequence in which he shows her what he looks like in the light. Hes supposed to sparkle; instead he looks as if hes covered in blond fur. Other scenes fall short as well. The less said about the Cullen family baseball game for example the better. Still Twilight will doubtless thrill fans of the books who have long waited for its release. And while its not a failure everyone else will wish that the film had if youll excuse the expression a little more bite. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Marilyn Monroe and JFK both had sexy sanpakus (in which the white of the orb is strikingly visible below the iris) and so does Robert Pattinson the young British heartthrob who plays Edward Cullen Twilights dreamy sculpted hunk of a teenage vampire. With pasty skin red lips and those peepers that pop open wide with a touch of madness Pattinson has a look so broodingly unearthly its no wonder he doesnt sprout fangs. His creepy bedroom stare is a special effect all its own. Here as in Stephenie Meyers 2005 novel Edward is Romeo Heathcliff James Dean and Brad Pitt all rolled into one a scruffy-gorgeous bloodsucker pinup who is really an angelic protector. When Bella (Kristen Stewart) who has come to Forks Wash. to live with her police-chief dad sits next to Edward in biology class he acts like hes suffering a seizure (or an attack of bad Mexican food). But its only because he can barely control himself around her. Its no surprise that Bella tunes out the other kids even as they try to befriend her. They dont make her tingle with the fear of her own desire. Edward like any good vampire has a predatory glamour. As Bella gets to know him whats irresistible to her is that he promises not a blood consummation but its very opposite a refusal to give in to the hunger that tempts him most. For girls the intense ego-stroking appeal of Meyers novel was the way that Bella becomes this undead Byronic studs soul mate without quite knowing why shes worthy. Shes a Kewl Generation damsel waiting to be rescued from her jaded heart. Stewart is an ideal casting choice -- she conveys Bellas detachment as well as her need to bust through it. And getting Catherine Hardwicke to direct Twilight was a shrewd move because the youthquake specialist of Thirteen treats teen confusion without a trace of condescension She gets their grand passions and prickly defense mechanisms. She has reconjured Meyers novel as a cloudburst mood piece filled with stormy skies rippling hormones and understated visual effects. What Hardwicke cant quite triumph over is the books lackluster plot. On screen Twilight is repetitive and a tad sodden too prosaic to really soar. But Hardwicke stirs this teen pulp to a pleasing simmer. B Robert Pattinson talks about Twilight More Twilight EWs Twilight Central Twilight reviews roundup And the verdict is...

"Movie review Twilight -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Twilight -- 3 out of 5 stars The worldwide literary phenomenon comes to life in Twilight the story of the unexpected romance between a teenage girl and a mysterious and irresistible vampire. Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) and Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen) star as a post-modern Romeo and Juliet in the suspenseful adventure with a supernatural bite. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Theres a playfulness that seems just so right in Catherine Hardwickes Twilight. The director of thirteen gives the hit Stephenie Meyer teen vampire novel a little edge a little sexual heat. But she makes it fun too.The irresistible force that draws Bella the new girl in Forks High to Edward the dreamy classmate with pale skin and red red lips is lust. And lust can be funny. But after a brooding arms-length courtship of overcast days near-accidents and almost kisses Edwards clan heads out in a thunderstorm to play baseball. And Twilight tumbles from romantic into risible. Buffy the Vampire Dater becomes Transylvania High School Musical.The fetching but somewhat humorless Kristen Stewart is Bella a girl so swoony over her new bio class lab partner that she cannot close her lips. Who can blame her? Edward Cullen (Robert PattinsonO ) his hair piled high with eyes that seem to match that hair color is dreamy but rude. Hes instantly put off by Bella and that puts her off. Then a car almost crushes Bella in the school parking lot. In a flash Edward is by her side stopping the careening student driver denting the dudes car with just his touch. He instantly regrets it.""Cant you just thank me and get over it??They fight the feeling and Bella does her homework. A Native American friend of the family Jacob (Taylor Lautner) gives her hints of ""the legend."" Google gives her more. Seeing the rest of the Cullen clan -- pale incestuously close ageless and sophisticated -- gives them away.But can these kids find love? Will Bella touch Edwards icy skin and melt his cold cold heart? Meanwhile Bellas dad the police chief ( Billy Burke) is tracking local ""animal attacks"" that might not be the work of your run-of-the-mill wolf or grizzly. A trio of nomadic vampires dressed like Motley Crue groupies (Cam Gigandet Edi Gathegi and Rachelle LefevreO ) have moved into this hunting ground. They get a whiff of Bella and its game on.Hardwicke boils down Meyers novel into a sort of Romeo amp; Juliet star-crossed lovers the fates keep apart. This is more Superman The Movie with Bellas incessant Qamp;A sessions with Edward getting the parameters of Meyers vampire universe. The relationship at the heart of the film has heat but Stewart isnt up to delivering the ""Ill just die"" longing that we all feel at that age. And the effects that show Edwards speed are cut-rate comical.The situations in high school and among the vampires are over-familiar. But the dialogue is mostly flip and hip. Some of the laughs are intentional some not. A vampire using the word ""vegetarian?"" Funny.There are four books in this series so if Twilight hits theyll make more. Two more movies of restraint controlling your teenage urges? Like Edward weve all had practice at that. ""Ill just have to endure it.""

Photo Peter Sorel AP Image 8 of 8 Movie review Dreamy undead in Twilight 1 / 8 Back to Gallery ""Twilight"" will probably be a huge disappointment to those expecting a horror film a lot of good special effects a kinky sexual vampire picture or any combination of the above. More time during this movie is spent talking about going to the prom than drinking human blood. The climactic battle takes place in a ballet studio. But for the legion of fans of Stephenie Meyers book this entertaining adaptation provides at least three movies worth of teen angst dreamy good looks and sparkly-skinned vampires (more on that later). Although you may not get sucked into the world of ""Twilight"" after watching this movie you will at least understand what all the fuss is about. ""Twilight"" for those who didnt nearly get crushed last week during a cast members publicity-tour stop in San Francisco is the first in a series of hugely popular books that seem aimed primarily at a teen female demographic. It focuses on a human girl named Bella who falls in love with Edward a member of a group of teenage-looking vampires living in Washington state. Dont worry Pacific Northwesterners These awkward-acting but benevolent vampires have trained themselves to drink animal blood. Themes range from a mysterious pattern of killings to whos going to wear what dress to the aforementioned big dance. Will a second group of human blood-swilling vampires strike Bella and her family? Will Bellas friend Angela get enough guts to ask nerdy Eric out on a date? ""Twilight"" was filmed with a small budget which may have been the best thing for the project. Catherine Hardwicke director of the underrated ""Lords of Dogtown"" has a knack for making her young actors seem unpolished and real even when the events from the book and even the dialogue are inherently ridiculous. This courtesy extends to the adults in the movie who are rarely dumb naive or mean. Bellas town sheriff dad Charlie (Billy Burke) is a pleasant cross between Harry Dean Stanton in ""Pretty in Pink"" and Andy Griffith. Although this film will seem bloated to newcomers and the plot kicks into gear slowly ""Twilight"" never has the rushed or stilted feel of a 500-page book thats been adapted into a two-hour film. Small things seem to be missing but considering the number of characters introduced and themes that are explored its a credit to Hardwicke and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg that the movie remains coherent throughout. The production also benefits from two good leads Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson as Bella and Edward. Pattinson in particular is convincing as a 100-year-old vampire stuck in a ""Groundhog Day""-style existence that has him going to high school after high school surrounded by a supermarket full of the young blood he craves but cannot eat. ""Twilight"" has its Jason Patric and Jami Gertz but it needs a Kiefer Sutherland. The bad guys are an afterthought in this movie and when they show up theyre only slightly more menacing than a class bully. The special effects are also borderline ridiculous - particularly when the vampires are either running super-fast (youll want to fill in your own ""Six Million Dollar Man"" sound effects) or exposed to the sun. Which brings us to the sparkling a phenomenon that causes light-stricken vampires to suddenly look as if theyve had a horrible accident involving a glitter truck and an angry mob armed with Bedazzlers. What may have seemed cool in the book looks like a human disco ball onscreen. Still its very easy to forgive the dopey parts of this drama especially if youre a parent whose teen daughter will be among the screaming pack of ""Twilight"" fans who will see this movie five times during the first weekend alone. ""Twilight"" has a few gory plot turns - mostly offscreen - and one near-sex scene that may offend a few Amish people but the rest is maybe 33 percent less wholesome than ""High School Musical."" Its almost certainly less risque than what you were watching when you were 14. (Cue the soundtrack to ""Risky Business."") One more small note which is very important for the future of our economy Several characters in this film have George Michaels gravity-defying birds-nest hair from the Wham ""Make It Big"" sessions which looks only slightly less ridiculous now than it did in 1984. Invest any spare cash you have in companies that deal in hair gel. I have a feeling this film is going to be huge. -- AdvisoryThis movie contains some violence and sensuality. This material also attracts packs of girls with extremely high-pitched voices who will scream every time their favorite character comes onscreen. Bring earplugs or at least sit at least six rows away from anyone female between the ages of 12 and 15. Twilight Romantic horror drama. Starring Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Billy Burke.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint They stalk you by night mesmerize you and they have an unquenchable desire to exchange bodily fluids. Lets face it vampires are inherently sexy creatures. And the teenage pin-ups roaming the halls of Forks High School ivory-skinned sanguivores who use dramatic amounts of hair product are the hottest cold-bloods around. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) goes into a trance state whenever she sees Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). No hypnotic gestures required. Unless you live under a rock which is itself under a larger rock you know that Bella and Edward are the main characters in ""Twilight"" a bestselling young-adult vampire novel by Stephenie Meyer and now a film. Regular girl Bella a new arrival in eternally overcast Forks Wash. is instantly smitten with Edward an aloof smoldering hunk assigned as her biology lab partner. Bellas biology is in an uproar since shes at the age when adolescents are vulnerable to the life-altering drama of a first love that is way too completely special and perfect for anyone else on Earth to possibly comprehend. Edward is perfect plus he is sensitive to the point of melancholy and has an eating disorder which makes him even more perfect. And his ability to rescue Bella from a careening van with superhuman strength? OH EM GEE Edward is such a total package that Bella remains hooked even when she learns that hes a daywalking vampire. His family isnt from the Vlad the Impaler/Erzebet Bathory bloodline though. Theyre vegetarian vamps pledged to feed on animal blood. Its not as tasty as human hemoglobin; Edward likens animal plasma to tofu. Still the Cullens pride themselves in keeping their urges in check working off their excess energy with wholesome pastimes like vampire baseball. Thus Edwards very un-teenage-boy-like sexual restraint and the fact that relations between him and Bella are restricted to lots of steamy glances and a bit of (non-penetrative) necking. The excitement of this PG-13 tale mostly concerns the eroticism of abstinence. At least until the last reel when a villainous vampire trio gets a sniff of the succulent Bella and the rival bloodsuckers go all Wing Chun on each other. Director Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"" ""The Lords of Dogtown"") leads her young cast through the storys soap opera elements with honest respect for the material. The look of the film is naturalistic and the performances are earnest if a bit overwrought. Stewart doesnt blink her enormous eyes or smile as Bella but her unswerving seriousness puts us on her side. The girl deserves some fun especially living with her well-meaning but wooden single dad Forks top cop. Billy Burke is deadpan perfection as Chief Charlie Swan. Hes clearly consumed by post-divorce loneliness but cant show it and comically out of his depth trying to fathom the strange teenage female sharing his house. Im ill-suited to judge Pattinsons portrayal of Edward but the low female moans that rolled through the preview audience as his lips brushed Stewarts neck tell me hes right on target. Two sequels to ""Twilight"" are already in the works and with luck the all-but-guaranteed success of the first installment means bigger budgets for the follow-ups. Special-effects sequences of the vampires moving at super speed or leaping high in the air have the cheeseball quality of entry-level Kung Fu flicks. There are plenty of intentional jokes in ""Twilight."" We shouldnt be tempted to laugh at the big dramatic finish. TWILIGHT  1/2 out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 for some violence and a scene of sensuality.

"More tasty teen angst - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs More tasty teen angstNovember 20 2009|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE NEWSPAPERS CRITICThe Twilight Saga New Moon The following is a capsule review of Michael Phillips review of ""The Twilight Saga New Moon."" For the full review visit chicagotribune.com/talkingpictures.""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" is actually pretty good -- a tick better than the first ""Twilight"" which wasnt bad either. These are hardly superlatives on the order of ""shattering"" and ""beautiful"" but compared to the film versions of ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels amp; Demons"" theyre matchless.When last we left Bella and her vampire boyfriend Edward theyd come through serious tests of their endless love. ""New Moon"" separates the pair fairly early on and Bella pines.Then she is pulled out of her funk -- halfway anyway; its a big funk -- by her pal Jacob who is sweet and hunky but who is a werewolf and theres the treaty with the vampires which ... well either you already know this or you will never care.Why does ""New Moon"" work? The film does not try to eat you alive. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are interesting to watch. And theyre strong enough to compensate for the comparatively amateurish Taylor Lautner as the shirtless wolf boy whose subtext is the same scene to scene Have you seen my abs?Director Chris Weitz and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg may let the rhythm slacken in the final half-hour but that is unlikely to matter to the people who with this films closing line could be heard squeaking in anticipation of the third ""Twilight"" due in 2010.Running time 210.

In the novel Bella and her cold-to-the-touch lothario Edward talk and talk and talk. For the beautifully photographed (by cinematographer Elliot Davis) film version screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg (bless her) has pared the couples blather down to the essentials as when Edward (Robert Pattinson) says to Bella (Kristen Stewart) ""Youre my own personal brand of heroin."" Poor girl. How could she not succumb? Actually Bellas in love/lust the moment she walks into her new Pacific Northwest high school and sees Edward who shuns her and then loves her obsessively. Eventually he introduces her to his progressive vampire family--they eat wild animals not people--and invites her for a game of bloodsucker baseball where they encounter a vampire thug (Cam Gigandet) who begins stalking Bella. Director Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen Lords of Dogtown) has drawn strong star-making performances from her two leads but in the end shes clearly no more interested in vampires than Meyer herself. In the 17-million-copy land of Twilight the calling card isnt blood and fangs but the exquisite shimmering quiver of unconsummated first love. By that measure the movie version gives really good swoon.

Built-in femme fanbase will lend this Summit Entertainment release some serious B.O. bite with Robert Pattinsons turn as an undead heartthrob keeping repeat biz at a steady pump. Vampires and the poor human beings who love them have been a hot onscreen item this season as evidenced by HBOs lurid hit series ""True Blood"" and the marvelous Swedish import ""Let the Right One In."" For less discriminating palates theres the much-anticipated ""Twilight"" a disappointingly anemic tale of forbidden love that should satiate the pre-converted but will bewilder and underwhelm viewers who havent devoured Stephenie Meyers bestselling juvie chick-lit franchise. Built-in femme fanbase will lend this Summit Entertainment release some serious B.O. bite with Robert Pattinsons turn as an undead heartthrob keeping repeat biz at a steady pump. Having shown a real feel for the perilous social and emotional terrain of adolescent girlhood in her 2003 debut ""Thirteen"" Catherine Hardwicke seemed as good a director as any to steer this maiden adaptation of Meyers junior-Anne-Rice phenomenon. (Three more novels -- ""New Moon"" ""Eclipse"" and ""Breaking Dawn"" -- have been released since ""Twilights"" publication in 2005 and the movie is nothing if not a prelude to future bigscreen sequels.) But even with angsty rock songs lurching camerawork and emo-ish voiceover at her disposal Hardwicke cant get inside the head of her young protagonist Isabella ""Bella"" Swan (Kristen Stewart); consequently Bellas decision to get hot and heavy with a hot-and-hungry vampire far from seeming like an act of mad transgressive passion comes across as merely stupid and ill-considered. The result is a supernatural romance in which the supernatural and romantic elements feel rushed unformed and insufficiently motivated leaving audiences with little to do but shrug and focus on the eye-candy. Which is what Bella does when she first meets the brooding intoxicatingly handsome Edward Cullen (Pattinson) at her new high school in Forks Wash. Bella a moody intelligent teen whos just moved from Phoenix to live with her police-chief dad (Billy Burke) is an outsider in this dreary little Pacific Northwest town. So are Edward and his four equally striking (if unnaturally pallid) siblings who keep to themselves go on regular camping trips and have an odd habit of never eating. Bella finds herself utterly transfixed by Edward. (Judging by the screaming tweens in the audience at the screening caught shes not alone.) Yet devoid of the novels first-person narration the chain of events laid out in Melissa Rosenbergs screenplay -- Edwards initial and inexplicable hostility toward Bella his habit of rescuing her from contrived endangerment scenarios their playfully barbed flirtation his revelation of his identity as a self-controlled but still-lethal bloodsucker and finally their mutual surrender to their feelings -- proceeds with none of the inner logic necessary even for a tale of the fantastic. Admittedly its a relief that Rosenberg dispenses with Meyers often embarrassingly overripe prose (""His hair was dripping wet disheveled ... his dazzling face was friendly open a slight smile on his flawless lips"") and pics selective rewriting of the rules of vampire lore (no coffins no garlic no fatal aversion to sunlight) does hold interest. Theres a fleeting moment when the two leads -- standing together in a secluded glade their bodies circled by the camera -- come close to capturing the tales lush swooning romanticism. Stewart (seen recently and most impressively in ""Into the Wild"") makes Bella earthy appealing and slightly withdrawn and British thesp Pattinson (who registered poignantly as the ill-fated Cedric Diggory in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"") is every inch the deadly dreamboat. But as helmed by Hardwicke the actors early awkward interactions feel particularly forced and the script gives Stewart virtually nothing with which to convince the audience of her transcendent love for a guy whod just as soon drink her blood as jump her bones. Burke steals a few scenes as Bellas quietly dependable dad as does the reliably sharp-witted Anna Kendrick as Bellas busybody friend Jessica. Questionable casting of some of Bellas other classmates may rile purists though Hardwicke and Rosenberg generate some laughs from the high school setting. Pic duly introduces Jacob (Taylor Lautner) a Native American youth who looks to rival Edward for Bellas affections in future outings. In an unwise departure from the book pic dispels rather than increases the tension by showing random vampire attacks by a sinister trio (Cam Gigandet Rachelle Lefevre Edi Gathegi) headed toward a showdown with Edward and his brood. Chase-thriller endgame seems to sputter to a halt when its barely begun. Visual effects used to convey the vampires superhuman strength agility and resistance to gravity are a mixed bag. Shot in moody washed-out tones by Hardwickes regular lenser Elliot Davis pic makes the most of its Oregon locations .
