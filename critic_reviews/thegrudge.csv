The premise of this high-gloss low-resolution remake simply transcribes the standard haunted-house exegesis of Shimizus Ju-on When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born. We presume such a deathly birth has occurred in the abode where a brother-sister pair of American transplants install their mother who suffers from early-stage dementia but appears instantly attuned to the creakings and rattlings that waft from the walls and ceilings... As he did in Ju-on Shimizu builds his film out of chronologically jumbled set pieces that each proceed by an alternating pattern of tense lulls and pay-off jolts. The overdetermined approach preempts the character shadings or social subtext that Japanese horror maestro Hideo Nakata prizes while the soundtracks Dolby thumps and screaming violins head off any genuine scares.

Barring the tweaking of a couple of plot elements and the introduction of some American actors (notably Sarah Michelle Gellar) to make the film more appealing to a Western audience the movies are pretty much identical -- not to mention identically silly. Theyre also pretty darn scary that is if youre susceptible to such ""Carrie""-style creep-outs as a hand suddenly reaching out to grab someone from a stagnant kitchen drain. Sarah Michelle Gellar sees a house full of dead people in ""The Grudge"" the Americanized version of a Japanese horror film. (Kenji Takeuchi -- Columbia Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  The Grudge Details  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now The similarity is no surprise. Director Takashi Shimizu worked on both films. In a feat of creative bankruptcy -- or remarkable purity of artistic vision depending on your point of view -- he even recycles many of the exact same spooky shots from one film to the next. He even uses the same child actor (Yuya Ozeki who plays the creepy ghost-boy Toshio) in both films. Set in Tokyo both films center on a home care worker (in this case Gellar) who discovers a catatonic elderly woman (Grace Zabriskie) sitting in befouled bed sheets in an otherwise empty house. Okay its not entirely empty. Gellars Karen also discovers a small saucer-eyed boy (Ozeki) and a black cat duct-taped into an upstairs closet. (The thing is hes not really ""there"" at least not in the sense that most of us normally use the word ""there"" if you catch my drift.) Subsequently it becomes apparent that everyone who comes into contact with the house -- Karens boss (Ted Raimi brother of the films producer Sam) her boyfriend (Jason Behr) the police detective (Ryo Ishibashi) who investigates the boys appearance and subsequent disappearance -- all fall victim to the kind of unspeakable evil that aficionados of this type of film will by now be overly familiar with and that here sometimes takes the form of a bloblike cloud of black hair. Where ""The Grudge"" and ""Ju-on The Grudge"" deviate is in their relative levels of obviousness. In what could be read as a response to critics of the first film some of whom complained about the vagueness of whatever or whoever was haunting the house writer-director Shimizu this go-round makes a herculean effort to explain everything to a fare-thee-well. In ""The Grudges"" most ridiculous sequence Karen watches -- courtesy of a cast of obliging ghosts led by Bill Pullman whose character throws himself off a high-rise balcony in the films first minute -- a kind of reenactment of what exactly happened in the house three years ago. Its just too too much and anyone other than the most cretinous viewer or those who stepped out for popcorn at an inopportune moment ought to feel insulted. That being said its effectively frightening. Its just not the kind of frightening that stays with you very long unless of course someone decides to make the same movie . . . yet again. And given the fact that there were three iterations of the Japanese ""Ju-on"" theres already talk of an English-language sequel to ""The Grudge."" THE GRUDGE (PG-13 88 minutes) -- Contains disturbing occasionally violent imagery and mild sensuality. In English and some Japanese with subtitles. Area theaters.

If youve seen big stupid American versions of Frances ""Three Men and a Cradle"" or recently Japans ""Shall We Dance?"" you can only mutter Guilty guilty guilty. Now along comes ""The Grudge"" adapted from a terrifyingly creepy Japanese film and the only verdict is Innocent innocent innocent. That is because ""The Grudge"" though it now stars perky attractive Yanks assiduously avoids Americanizing the films essential bleakness of spirit. The film is still set in Japan and still directed by the original creator Takashi Shimizu and its ending is just as crushing. In fact you might argue that this version of the film is a little better than the original. Sarah Michelle Gellar is an American nurse who is overwhelmed by her life in Japan. (Courtesy Of Sony Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  The Grudge Details  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now For one thing Shimizu has more money to play with this time around. So the effects are much better but theyre still Japanese effects -- and they dont overwhelm as they have in so many American films of late. In the originals (he made four two for video then two theatrical releases) he was limited to chalky-faced ghosts slipping in and out of the corridors of his haunted house; here he can evoke a demon hovering in the air with a penumbra of inky dread shimmering about the corpses face. Its pretty damned alarming. Hes also found a cool new level of apprehension to add to the mixture Thats the subtle fear most American new to Japan feel in that highly organized and internalized place. They dont quite get it. (Nobody whos not Japanese quite gets it.) So theyre always slow to interpret slow to respond tentative and vulnerable. In fact one of the most disturbing moments depicts a young American woman in that most horrifying of venues the supermarket where she consults price tags that resemble drafts of contracts between multinational corporations in 200 billion deals. When she swallows glumly her larynx clotted with a tide of overmatched outsiders phlegm you find yourself swallowing too. Basically Shimizu sticks exactly to the plot of the original including its somewhat lackadaisical storytelling style. Theres this house see? Its somewhere on the outskirts of Tokyo a place of ample rooms with a garden in that stark Japanese aesthetic of bare wood and sharp angles. One could be so happy there if one were drawn to things Japanese but it seems that some time ago in that comfy dwelling a man discovered his wife was having an affair. So in a fit of insanity he murdered her and their son then hanged himself. A Japanese tradition insists that those who die enraged leave their bitter fury behind and it takes the form of demons which assail all who enter. Enter stage left one at a time a whole parade of Americans. The most prominent of them is Sarah Michelle Gellar and its pleasing to report that she never goes all Buffy (as in the vampire-slaying TV character she played) on the Japanese demons. Instead like all the others she is simply terrified into gibbering insanity. And lets give Gellar some credit She appears without much makeup and hasnt insisted upon being photographed in that romantic American starlight of pure adorability. She lets Shimizu and his cinematographer light her plainly so that her eye-shadowless orbs lose their cosmetic power and the shortness of her chin is not hidden by soft shadow. She plays Karen a young nurse living with her boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr) an architecture student in Tokyo. Shes volunteering at some sort of outreach counseling service for disabled Americans (I guess; details are somewhat hazy here) and is sent to a house where an elderly American woman needs tending. That womans original tender Takako Fuji has been disappeared in the movies first few seconds; Fuji appeared in the first four all-Japanese ""Grudges"" as well and has presumably been disappeared before. This time weve watched her dragged screaming and kicking into the attic. So we know up front what Gellars Karen doesnt Theres something evil living up there. Gellars character is an axis upon which the movie either rotates forward or backward in time to study other Americans in the house -- a young family for one; and before that an American visiting college professor played by eternal nice guy Bill Pullman -- who come to unwholesome ends. Thus the movie like its predecessors never modulates or acquires momentum or seems to reach any kind of climactic action; it simply keeps watching as this or that pretty lad or lass has a close encounter with the horror in the attic. Its enough to send you home with jiggly knees and a tummy ache. The Grudge (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 which is a scandal since its intensity and unpleasantness and love of disturbing imagery though short of gore are too intense for most young people.

(Columbia Pictures/Kenji Takeuchi) DatebookDatebookChronicle10/22/2004Advance0422419518 Photo KENJI TAKEUCHI Mindless killing weakens Grudge 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Grudge Horror. Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar Jason Behr Clea DuVall and Bill Pullman. Directed by Takashi Shimizu. (Rated PG-13 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its always a promising sign in a horror film when the body count is already at two before the opening credits are finished. ""The Grudge"" begins with a lot of potential -- Sarah Michelle Gellar in a role that works for her good use of the Japan location shoot and a script that trusts the audience to follow a dozen characters -- and the movie is enjoyable for the first hour. But writer-director Takashi Shimizu cant quite pull everything together trying to get off easy with a bargain-bin twist ending that most of the audience will see coming by the time the pile of corpses reaches double digits. Shimizu shouldnt get too much credit for creating such a well-paced movie -- its the third time hes made ""The Grudge"" in two years with a Japanese version called ""Ju-on"" and its sequel released in 2003. If that sounds like the pedigree of ""The Ring"" its no coincidence. ""The Grudge"" has the same producer as ""The Ring"" and uses a similar combination of the undead and technology with mysterious voices on telephones freaky little kids in a lot of gray makeup -- and yes a videotape does make its way into the plot. Gellar plays Karen a social worker in Japan who shares a small apartment with her perfect boyfriend (Jason Behr). She gets assigned to take care of an older American woman who suffers from dementia and lives in a spooky house which unleashes a horrible curse on everyone who enters. The ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" actress will probably never need to write an Oscar acceptance speech and her wasted opportunities in mindless comedy (Gellars Daphne was the worst thing about ""Scooby Doo"" and thats saying something) have ensured that she wont fulfill her destiny as the next Meg Ryan either. But Gellar is beautiful and sweet and exudes capability which is perfect for a horror film. As Karen discovers that the house has some really freaky stuff going on inside it she may not come out alive but you know she wont be stupid enough to look around in the attic without calling for some backup. While roughly half of the cast is from the United States (including Bill Pullman and Grace Zabriskie now typecast as George Costanzas almost mother- in-law on ""Seinfeld"") the exteriors are shot in Japan which helps keep the slow parts interesting. It also adds to the helplessness that surrounds the American victims who are not only seeing bizarre visions but also feeling isolated because of the language barrier. Shimizu follows the lives of Karen her boyfriend and coworkers two families a pair of cops and a mysterious suicide victim and his wife -- lingering with each character long enough to make the audience care about their fates. Which makes it all the more disappointing when the director wraps it all up with a seen-it-before ending fit for a rerun of ""CSI Miami."" Many of the scares are well-earned but theyre also repetitious. Much like the less enjoyable ""Gothika"" the mysterious evil in ""The Grudge"" comes in full view during the first half of the movie leaving Shimizu nowhere to go except to show the same decreasingly frightening images over and over again. Also while its nice that the script for ""The Grudge"" avoids the cliche that horror movie victims must somehow ""deserve"" their fate it turns out to be more frustrating watching gruesome deaths that are happening to random nice people. As it turns out there is such a thing as a horror film with too much mindless killing. -- Advisory This film contains violence gore and strong language.

(My exceptions to that axiom are 1944s The Uninvited and Jerry Lewis donning Carmen Miranda drag in 1953s Scared Stiff.) Another scary movie Jason Behr and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Grudge a remake of a popular Japanese horror film. Sony Pictures The Grudge varies the program some by occasionally getting its apparitions out of the central digs to make mischief elsewhere. (Related video See a preview of The Grudge) And the new films hill of beans doesnt loom very tall when its acting weight rests on the shoulders of Sarah Michelle Gellar and the ever-likable but unassertive Bill Pullman. At least the horror premise here has a hook -- a house can spread its curse like a plague to adversely affect all who enter. But this wouldnt be a post-Exorcist horror pic if a demonized child (or child figure) werent a catalyst in the mischief. All those little snots you didnt like in kindergarten have matured just enough to overpopulate our movies. (Coming in three weeks Seed of Chucky). About the movie The Grudge   (out of four) Stars Sarah Michelle Gellar Bill Pullman Jason Behr Clea DuVall KaDee Strickland Directors Takashi Shimizu Distributor Columbia Pictures Rated PG-13 for mature thematic material disturbing images/terror/violence and some sensuality. Opens Friday nationwide So here its Japan-based exchange student Gellar getting called to house-sit a catatonic middle-aged mom (Grace Zabriskie acting as if she starred in one Twin Peaks episode too many). With her predecessor already dispatched Gellar is set up to become one of the movies two cuties-in-peril. Interestingly both victims come to The Grudge with apt resumes Gellar has been fighting TV vampires and KaDee Strickland was the non-slithering standout in Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid. It didnt take director Takashi Shimizu long to remake his own Ju-onThe Grudge just a year and change. You can argue whether hes had better luck here than George Sluizer did a decade ago blandly Hollywood-izing his French/Netherlands triumph The Vanishing. Produced by Spider-Man director Sam Raimi The Grudge takes its time rationing intermittent jolts all the way up to historys millionth cheap Carrie-like capper. But it ought to get a weeks worth of business out of the horror audience thats as loyal as it is limited. As some wise person once said Hollywood will always churn out movies like this as long as there are teenage girls who want to squeeze the hands of teenage boys while sitting in a dark theater. Well heres to romance.

In its quest to appropriate global filmmaking trends Hollywood has honed in on a series of Japanese cult horror pics most notable for bad acting and pedestrian direction. First came DreamWorks profitable redo of director Hideo Nakatas ""The Ring"" (its sequel will arrive next year along with a remake of Nakatas ""Dark Water"") and now there is helmer Takashi Shimizus ""The Grudge."" Pic is a woeful Americanization of a creaky haunted-house story Shimizu has filmed four times in Japan. While press notes say pics titular curse never forgives or forgets viewers of this Sam Raimi-produced sub-""Amityville"" scarefest are likely to hold the real grudge. ""The Grudge"" began life as a popular low-budget Japanese vidpic entitled ""Ju-On"" (aka ""Ju-On The Curse""). ""Ju-On"" in turn spawned a sequel which was followed by theatrical remakes of both vidpics (called ""Ju-On The Grudge"" and ""Ju-On The Grudge 2"" respectively). All four films were directed by Shimizu and produced by the indefatigable Taka Ichise (also responsible for the ""Ring"" franchise). The four films all told more or less the same story An unassuming home in suburban Tokyo that was the scene of a gruesome murder-suicide is haunted by the three people who died there -- a young boy his mother and the crazed father/husband who killed them and then himself. Because of the circumstances of their deaths the spirits cannot rest easily and so they subject the occupants of the house to their wrath. And while its not exactly clear what happens to their victims suffice it to say that very few make it out alive. This is not of course the first time a foreign director has been hired to remake his own film in Hollywood. However ""The Grudge"" bears an unusual fidelity to its source material in that it preserves those pics Japanese setting and even uses a couple of the same actors -- Yuya Ozeki who also played the boy in the two Japanese theatrical versions and Takako Fuji who has played the mother in all five pics. Storyline has been imported more or less intact from ""Ju-On The Grudge."" A young social worker (Sarah Michelle Gellar her face permanently frozen into a glazed-over expression) arrives to care for an elderly housebound woman (Grace Zabriskie) and encounters the undead family. Other than changing the social worker from a Japanese woman to an American exchange student -- and giving her a scruffy boyfriend played by former ""Roswell"" star Jason Behr -- primary modifications made by screenwriter Stephen Susco dont materialize until pics final act. But if ever there was a remake that should have worshipped less faithfully at its predecessors altar ""The Grudge"" is it. Like ""Ju-On The Grudge"" new pic is less of a linear narrative than a series of flashbacks depicting earlier victims. And each of these scenes seems to have been scripted according to the horror-movie rules so deftly skewered by Wes Craven in his ""Scream"" pictures a shadow streaks across the room or some floorboards creak; the naive about-to-be victim goes to investigate and is startled by some sort of red herring; then finally the big ""gotcha"" moment occurs and screen fades to black only to begin again. ""Ju-On The Grudge"" didnt resolve this roundelay at its conclusion suggesting the endless possibilities (or possible endlessness) of the scenario. In the American version the ending is less ambiguous but no less tolerant of a sequel. Project might have been more successful if Shimizu had style and/or atmosphere to substitute for his canned scares cardboard compositions and flaccid cutting. With its assembly-line atonal chimes vibrato strings and low-frequency rumbles Christopher Youngs musical score quickly earns a place in the horror-movie hall-of-shame.

In a modest corner of Tokyo there is an ordinary-seeming split-level house and a bad thing once happened there and ghosts now reside in the house and the principal spectre looks like a medieval feminine demon out of Japanese folklore. It has silky long black hair a powder-white face and a way of slithering up to whomever its trying to spook before popping open its eyes in a mad grimace of frozen fear. One after another people enter the house and inevitably they wind up on the receiving end of the Kabuki death stare. The Grudge which stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as a transplanted apprentice social worker and a number of lesser-known actors who look even more at sea than she does is a horror film that consists of virtually nothing but dont-go-in-the-attic suspense scenes strung together with a reasonable degree of brooding mood and a minimum of logic. The film moves vaguely backward in time -- emphasis on vague -- as it wends its way toward the source of the houses curse. The director Takashi Shimizu was invited by producer Sam Raimi to do a Hollywood remake of Ju-On his horror thriller that played in the States earlier this year and given the degree to which that film was overrated expect to hear cries about how the purity of Shimizus vision has been toned down. But really Ju-On had a few potent scare images plugged into a barely functional story line and the same is true more or less of The Grudge. A movie like this one depends on the sinister goosing effectiveness of its soundtrack which in this case is a pushy cacophony of rustles scratches clangs bangs bumps in the night whining kitty snarls and the sort of tuneless violin skittering that Kubrick first employed as the sound of high anxiety in The Shining. In a rare moment of quiet theres a nifty sequence reminiscent of The Ring (a far superior thriller in both its Japanese and American versions) in which the ghost appears almost as a gathering puff of smoke on a grainy surveillance videotape. The rest of the time what The Grudge has going for it is the novelty of bare-bones fright-film conventions exported from another culture. ""Boo"" at least doesnt get lost in translation.
