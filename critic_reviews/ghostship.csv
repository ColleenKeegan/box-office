"The Death Boat washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On The Death Boat Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday October 25 2002 Say this much for ""Ghost Ship"" You know where its coming from right off the bat when beautiful people on a swank cruise ship get sliced diced julienned and chiffonaded in a mysterious accident. Within minutes of its opening scene in the ships nightclub the film becomes a slow-motion symphony of dangling limbs severed heads and promiscuously spurting blood clearly announcing that ""Ghost Ship"" will be sending chills down its audiences collective spine not with suspense but with the most graphic violence it can muster. From there its an hour and a half of dark wet corridors creaking doors creepy apparitions maggots corpses a skeleton in a closet - and blood lots of it dripping oozing gushing and at one point even filling up a swimming pool. The setting for all this sanguineous activity is the titular ghost ship christened the Antonia Graza the pride of the Italian line in 1962 when it suddenly disappeared. Shes been missing for 40 years when a Canadian Air Force pilot named Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) approaches salvage boat captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) with some photographs hes taken of a huge boat in the Bering Sea. Murph and his crew - which is suitably motley this being Hollywood - set out to find the ship and bring her in along with the riches she might hold. ""Ghost Ship"" features some fine actors as Murphs plucky band of maritime mercenaries Julianna Margulies Ron Eldard Isaiah Washington and Karl Urban all do their best to inject some character into what is an essentially featureless ghost-hunting procedural. Director Steve Beck (""Thirteen Ghosts"") does a good job of working out the spatial relations of the massive Antonia Graza a labyrinth of deadly cul-de-sacs and spooky corners. But he doesnt orchestrate the scares with much finesse. Whats more the whammies are punctuated with little tutorials on the international law of the sea that pretty much kill what little buzz there is. Alert viewers will see the big twist almost immediately but Beck nonetheless finds it necessary to include a long flashback during which all is explained. This passage a veritable orgy of death and gore set to a sexy techno beat is quite possibly the most offensive movie scene this critic has seen recently. The sequence is probably more distressing now than it would have been were the front pages not filled with news of local and international terror. But the thought of people - especially teenagers the films primary audience - eagerly watching such gratuitous and eroticized suffering seems like the height of perversity. Maybe its the time of year and maybe its the time of man but ""Ghost Ship"" and its ilk are beginning to feel not just morally questionable but downright redundant. GHOST SHIP (R 91 minutes) - Contains strong violence gore language and sexuality. At area theaters.

Launched with a few surprising touches and a disturbingly bloody prelude horror pic collapses under the weight of its own dull conception and weak direction dialogue and character portraits. The vast movie-movie possibilities of pitting a group of people against the haunts of a cursed Italian luxury liner are completely scuttled in ""Ghost Ship."" Launched with a few surprising touches and a disturbingly bloody prelude horror pic collapses under the weight of its own dull conception and weak direction dialogue and character portraits. Plot scavenged from a host of genre predecessors emphatically suffers in comparison to the current superior haunted ship adventure ""Below."" Just as loose lips sink ships so word-of-mouth will ensure a short theatrical voyage during the Halloween period with slightly better forecasts due for homevid. A literally bubbly start accented by composer John Frizzells lush arrangement of ""Senza Fine"" and title credits fashioned in lacy pink-colored script will make viewers think theyve stumbled into a Doris Day movie. But the champagne mood is viciously altered when aboard Italo luxury liner Antonia Graza in 1962 a party of revelers is sliced in half by a razor-sharp cable that snaps across the ballroom deck. The slow delayed reaction of the victims as they see half their bodies (and sometimes heads) fall away is certainly one of the bloodier moments in a Hollywood pic this year and about the only moment of style shown by helmer Steve (""Thirteen Ghosts"") Beck. Action abruptly shifts to the present and the waters off Alaska where the Arctic Warrior salvage tug is captained by Murphy (Gabriel Byrne). Murphy is cool but very much in charge though often having to rein in his feisty crew Epps (Julianna Margulies) whos virtually co-chief; first mate Gregg (Isaiah Washington); engine repairman Santos (Alex Dimitriades); and happy-go-lucky techies Dodge (Ron Eldard) and Munder (Karl Urban). Back at port crew is shown an aerial photo by local pilot Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) of a large ship floating in the Bering Sea. Intrigued by the monetary prospects of salvaging such a big item Murphy reduces Ferrimans demand for 20% of the take but -in the first of several less-than-believable plot points by scripters Mark Hanlon and John Pogue -- agrees to take the pilot along on the venture against all better judgment. It should be all speed ahead at this point but a persistently clumsy handling of pacing and staging undercuts the dramatic potential of nearly every sequence. Exploring the vessel allows the chance for production designer Graham ""Grace"" Walker to create some effectively dank and rust-laden interiors that suggest a rotted-out grandiosity but it also sets up many chances for silly self-evident lines ranging from ""Its beautiful"" to ""I told you to watch your step"" Epps is the first to see a ghost -- a little girl seen in the prelude. After encounters with corpses in the water and boxes full of bars of gold Epps is convinced they should retrieve the gold and leave the ship alone. But after an explosion kills Santos and sinks the Arctic Warrior the survivors are stuck on board at the hour mark where they each make close encounters with talking ghosts triggering a series of grisly dispatches of one crew member after another. All of this is haplessly linked to characters supposed ""marks"" of sin and a dapper fellow who labors for the Devil as a salvager of souls. In a sequence that resists explanation but dazzles for a few minutes the ghostly little girl ""shows"" Epps the massacre that happened on the liner and triggers Epps final stab at heroism. Pic jumps over many gaping story holes -- how Epps manages not to freeze to death floating in the icy Bering Sea among others-that any close examination renders the project an out-and-out comedy. Margulies manages to survive both ghost ship and movie carving out a physical perf obviously modeled on Sigourney Weavers school of tough-gal adventuring. The men largely appear adrift in roles more pencilled out than written. As the little girl ghost Emily Browning at least has the requisite deep eyes and the gaze of an old soul. Production package is adequate though hardly up to the typically high standards of a project produced by the likes of Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis. Frizzells music is scattershot ranging from an orchestral sound to bloodless techno. Effects images of luxury liners sinking are amazingly fake considering that its five years since the sinking of ""Titanic.""

Starring Jerry Seinfeld. Directed by Christian Charles. (R. 82 minutes. At the Lumiere.) ""What am I doin here?"" Jerry Seinfeld asks a live audience in a tiny smoke-filled comedy club. ""I made it I had my own show And Im doin stand- up?"" Why indeed would a spectacularly rich and successful man having logged nine seasons on the beloved ""Seinfeld"" sitcom choose to re-enlist in a line of duty that he describes as painful embarrassing and tantamount to ""going to work in your underwear."" ""Comedian"" an entertaining documentary that Seinfeld produced attempts to answer that question. Filmed with handheld digital-video cameras and shot over a 14-month period starting in February 2000 ""Comedian"" follows Seinfeld across the country in and out of the comedy dives where he started in the late 70s. Instead of relying on old jokes Seinfeld was determined to start his tour from scratch generating all new material leaving himself as raw and vulnerable as he had been in pre-stardom days. We see him onstage smooth in moments awkward in others at one point stumbling and blank. Trying out new material he says offstage is ""the equivalent to a normal person going to work in their underwear."" Its tough to sympathize with a man as wealthy and established as Seinfeld but ""Comedian"" has an engaging rhythm an immediacy thats genuine and unvarnished and a few great laughs. We see Seinfeld looking out preperformance at the vast Paramount Theatre in Oakland and wondering ""How could I possibly make all these people happy?"" We see him studying classic routines by Robert Klein and Richard Pryor at the Museum of Broadcasting and we get impromptu offstage chats with fellow comics Jay Leno Garry Shandling Ray Romano and Chris Rock. ""Comedian"" is actually a dual portrait one that contrasts the seasoned Seinfeld with Orny Adams a deeply insecure not untalented up-and-comer who would love more than anything to be Jerry Seinfeld. - This film contains raw language. -- Edward Guthmann ALL THE QUEENS MEN Wartime comedy. Starring Matt LeBlanc and Eddie Izzard. Directed by Stefan Ruzowitsky. Written by David Schneider. (Not rated. 101 minutes. In English and in German with English subtitles. At the Galaxy.) . Here are the reasons why ""All the Queens Men"" ought to work a) it has Eddie Izzard playing a sassy bisexual tranny b) it has Matt LeBlanc as a macho soldier in drag c) it has excellent cinematography and production design and d) it spins off a funny notion that during World War II Allied spies cross-dressed to cross Nazi lines. But none of that amounts to much and what we have here isnt a disaster exactly but a very handsomely produced let-down. Who knows why nifty ideas bomb? Id wager that the goulash of nationalities that worked on the film -- Austrian director Stefan Ruzowitsky American and Hungarian producers and American British and German actors -- was so scrambled that they never found a cohesive unified style. LeBlanc for starters doesnt know whether hes supposed to be heroic or funny as Special Agent Steven ORourke a brave American who in 1944 heads ""the poof platoon"" -- a wacky espionage unit of queens and faux queens. Their job to masquerade as women penetrate the German installation where Enigma cipher machines are built and break the Nazi communications code. Apart from LeBlanc theres Izzard as Tony ""a bisexual lesbian in a mans body"" James Cosmo as a dim-witted desk jockey David Birkin as an effeminate gay man and genius code breaker and Nicolette Krebitz as the sexy German resistance worker who provides a safe house to the spies and an open bed to LeBlanc. Ought to be funny but this overreaching hybrid of farce action and wartime tragedy never finds its groove. Even Izzard in real life a brilliant stand-up comic with innate flamboyance looks hemmed in stifled by the confusion of ""Queens Men."" -- This film contains sexual references and blunt language. -- Edward Guthmann NAQOYQATSI Wordless drama. Directed by Godfrey Reggio. Music by Philip Glass featuring Yo- Yo Ma. (PG. 87 minutes. At the Lumiere.) . ""Naqoyqatsi"" means ""war as a way of life"" in the Hopi language and this picture is a passionate visual indictment of the perilous state of our high- tech world. Yet without words there is nothing shrill here and there is even little outrage What emerges is rather an air of melancholy resignation that makes the momentum of the final sequence a thrilling coda. The initial images may well be the saddest and linger longest after the movies end. They tell of urban decay at its most appalling shot in heartbreaking detail and set against the background of what amounts to the first great concerto of the new century Philip Glass luminous wall-to-wall soundtrack composed for Yo- Yo Ma. This is heartbreakingly beautiful music. Much of the movie amounts to a vast panorama of often familiar images everything from marching soldiers to mushroom clouds manipulated and recontextualized digitally into a gripping kaleidoscope of conflicting emotions. Mas plangent cello coming through the cascades of arpeggios and insistent little melodies of Glass at his most inspired lend a humane edge to the frantic flow of the directors images. This breathtaking head trip of a movie brings to a close Reggios wordless trilogy that includes ""Koyaanisqatsi"" and ""Powaqqatsi"" and it is the climax of the filmmakers collaboration with Glass. The sound of Mas cello alone is reason not to miss ""Naqoyqatsi."" -- Octavio Roca PAID IN FULL Drama. Starring Wood Harris Mekhi Phifer. Directed by Charles Wood III. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). . ""Paid in Full"" starts with its main character bloodied on a gurney and looking ready to expire. Its one clue that this tale of drug dealers in 1980s Harlem wont be a frothy romp. And oh what a dreary story it turns out to be. It goes the way of most morality tales A good kid turns bad and bad things happen to him. This particular path to hell is lined with gunplay tricked-out Saabs and enough swear words to make Martin Lawrence wince. But the film still holds interest throughout which is a testament to the charisma of actors Wood Harris and Mekhi Phifer. As longtime pals who score big in the cocaine trade theyre about the most likable thugs one could hope for. The lanky slump-shouldered Harris (HBOs ""The Wire"") stays modest and shy even as his character goes from dry-cleaning delivery boy to neighborhood drug lord. His transformation into criminal is driven not by poverty but by admiration -- the movies one mildly original concept. He sees the self- confidence displayed by Phifers drug dealer and wants a piece of that action. Theres much to admire in Phifers character at least from his pals viewpoint. He always looks sharp using a toothbrush to keep his white tennies spiffy. Hes the kind of guy on whom a light always seems to shine. Phifer cant help but look handsome but he goes beneath his characters polish to reveal self-doubt. Hes especially good in a scene where the young man removes his armor -- gold medallion Rolex and multiple beepers -- and settles into bed suddenly as vulnerable as everybody else. ""Paid in Full"" is supposedly based on a true story but its so unexceptional it could have been based on a hundred stories all of them violent and foolhardy. Director Charles Wood III draws attention to ""Paids"" generic qualities by inserting shots from Brian De Palmas 1983 remake of ""Scarface."" Al Pacinos Tony Montana character long ago became a role model for narcotics pushers onscreen and off. But ""Scarface"" struck a chord by going over the top. ""Paid in Full"" plays it straight which is somewhat surprising given that Wood also directed the ""Wassup"" Budweiser ads. The picture is all about tough guys and their guns and their rivalries. Women are mostly relegated to porn videos the men watch. A few fleeting scenes between Harris character and his strait-laced girlfriend hint at real tenderness. Then shes pregnant without the audience getting to see how it happened. ""Paid in Full"" needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance. Cmon fellas Even Tony Montana was a little sweet on his sister. -- Contains extreme violence graphic sexuality. -- Carla Meyer  THE GREY ZONE Holocaust drama. Starring David Arquette Steve Buscemi Harvey Keitel Mira Sorvino. Directed and written by Tim Blake Nelson. (R. 108 minutes. At the Opera Plaza Shattuck in Berkeley CineArts in Sausalito and Camera 3 in San Jose.) . In Auschwitz the notorious Nazi death camp prisoners were often recruited as Sonderkommandos -- special forces forced to participate in the extermination of fellow Jews. In exchange they were given books alcohol and cigarettes and better food and lodging than other prisoners and granted an extra four months to live. When Tim Blake Nelson an actor (""O Brother Where Art Thou?"") and director (""O"") read about the Sonderkommandos in Primo Levis book ""The Drowned and the Saved"" he saw the dramatic potential in their story and focused on a Sonderkommando rebellion in 1944. The result ""The Grey Zone"" was an Obie- winning play first staged in Manhattan in 1996. In the film version of his grim drama Nelson doesnt soften the focus on a horrific situation as filmmakers from Mel Brooks to Roberto Benigni have. Eerie and harsh shot with in a palette of dark green and charcoal grays ""The Grey Zone"" doesnt spare us anything -- not the crematoria or gas chambers which he had built from original Nazi architectural plans not the Jews packed into transport trains not the tale of a young girl whom the Sonderkommandos try to save after she miraculously survives being gassed. Nelsons work is relentless grueling and courageous. He makes a large blunder in having American actors (David Arquette Steve Buscemi) play Hungarian Jews with American accents while Harvey Keitel plays a Nazi officer with a German accent. The dialogue which tends to be overly explicit as the characters hash out their moral dilemmas also betrays its stage roots. -- Contains raw language nudity brutal violence. -- Edward Guthmann THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS Musical comic drama. Starring Naomi Nishida Kenji Sawada Kiyoshiro Imawano Keiko Matsuzaka Shinji Takeda Naoto Takenaka and Tetsuro Tamba. Directed by Takashi Miike. Written by Kikumi Yamagishi. (Not rated. 113 minutes. In Japanese with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) . A case could be made that ""The Happiness of the Katakuris"" is a kind of strange existentialist comedy. What is happiness? Does it mean life has to meet your expectations (the Katakuri family is trying to run a successful country inn) or does it mean you accept the ups and downs that often come your way? There are plenty of low points in ""The Happiness of the Katakuris."" The biggest All the guests who check into the familys picturesque guest house wind up dead in their rooms. The first is from suicide the second and third from overzealous sex. To keep word from getting out the Katakuri clan buries its deceased visitors and tries to stave off inquiries from the police. All the while they sing songs about their challenges (a la ""Dancer in the Dark"" and ""8 Women"") as a way to gain perspective. They sing. They bury. They sing some more. They bury some more. A running joke in ""Katakuris"" The family is convinced a major road will soon be built that will connect people to their remote area which is in the shadow of a volcano. Soon they believe all their problems will be solved. Occasionally this film is funny and cute. When the familys little girl narrates it reaches a level of humor that is ironic and endearing. Fans of claymation will enjoy the first several minutes which feature claymation figures that turn into animals and people and strange objects. The claymation reappears at the end of ""Katakuris"" coinciding with a feeling of hope as the family yells out ""Lets laugh together. Thats happiness."" - Contains violence nudity strong language. -- Jonathan Curiel GHOST SHIP Horror. Starring Julianna Margulies Gabriel Byrne Isaiah Washington. Directed by Steve Beck. (R. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). . Its a rusted-out vessel riddled with holes and carrying booty taken from elsewhere. Thats the movie. The ship is also in bad shape. ""Ghost Ship"" is a stupid derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense. Granted there are only so many ways to kill people in these pictures but lingering on a woman on a meat hook doesnt make a movie scary. It makes it gross. Truly chilling horror films like ""The Ring"" build suspense with scant bloodshed. ""Ghost Ship"" about an Italian luxury liner turned poltergeist starts by slicing its passengers in half then showing the phantom-nerve results. As in the lights are on but the torsos not home. Whats already overkill becomes idiotic when the scene is repeated. The body slicing happened in 1962 when the luxury liner was driven by an engine and an evil force -- an early version of the hybrid. The evil force took over and the ship and its passengers vanished. A modern-day pilot spots the ship and asks a ragtag crew of salvagers led by Gabriel Byrne in full crusty mode to investigate. Julianna Margulies inherits the Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio role as a hard- charging gal who keeps up with the boys. Margulies does a serviceable job as these things go. Her character is the first to spot a ghost a little girl who warns her to get off the ship and leave behind the caseloads of gold the salvagers have discovered. That gold which came from another haunted ship is what got the ocean liner in trouble. Ghostly little girls are surefire scare machines or so goes the logic of lousy horror movies. Especially if the girl has a chilly British accent as this one does. Director Steve Beck a champion of overkill also includes several shots of the girls doll. Apparently the doll is also dead. The girl is not scary the doll is not scary and neither is the blood that trickles down the walls of an empty swimming pool. Its all been done before. More frightening is the crews ignorance. Byrne has to educate them in maritime history. These dumb-dumb seafarers are unaware apparently that a giant ship and 600 people disappeared a mere 40 years ago. Isaiah Washington as Byrnes first mate and resident skeptic is the lone bright bulb among the shipmates. Washington is also the only actor aware that hes in a C-grade movie and he mines the camp value of his characters lust for a hot dead lounge singer. The sailor doesnt know that assignations with ghost seductresses always lead somewhere and its never to marriage. -- This film contains violence gore raw language. -- Carla Meyer Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 4 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 5 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 6 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 10 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr C Ghost Ship Genre Horror; Starring Gabriel Byrne Julianna Margulies Ron Eldard Desmond Harrington Isaiah Washington; Director Steve Beck; Author Mark Hanlon; Release Date Wide 10/25/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 89; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted October 23 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT That creaking noise you hear in Ghost Ship is the rattling of countless plot skeletons that have sunk before. It?s the sound of bounty hunters tempted by the possibility of riches confronting the shades of people from the past who were seduced by the ever-same possibility of riches - and died gruesome deaths ages ago for their greed. In the case of this cumbersome tanker of a Halloween ghost story a strangely grim airplane pilot (Desmond Harrington) recruits a cocky salvage crew composed of the usual saints and sinners (played by Gabriel Byrne Julianna Margulies Isaiah Washington and Ron Eldard among others) to examine a mystery ship that turns out to be the cadaver of an Italian ocean liner lost at sea in 1962. A nifty opening scene all 60s-glam and ghoulish makes it wittily clear that 40 years ago something wicked that way went. But once ""Ghost Ship"" switches course to the present when graceless dialogue rules the waves (""This ship is f--ed up"") director Steve Beck (""Thirteen Ghosts"") never recaptures the eerie pizzazz of the prologue nor decides how good or evil dreamy or nightmarish he wants his ""Tales of the Crypt"" vessel to be.
