Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 15 2007 542 PM Able Was I Ere I Saw Alba The pneumatic star cant save Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. By Dana Stevens Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) encounters the Silver Surfer Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer (20th Century Fox) is an off-brand superhero movie the cinematic equivalent of one of those generic breakfast cereals with a badly drawn squirrel for a mascot. Its miscast underwritten muddily shot and slackly paced but theres something captivating about its unabashed shittiness. At the height of the trend toward moody self-reflexive slickly produced comic-book movies with A-list casts Fox just cranks out this seeming refugee from Saturday-morning television (at moments Silver Surfer feels like a worthy subject for commentary on MST3000) and plonks it on the screen as if to say ""Yo suckers you like superheroes? Watch this"" And if the mystifying success of the first Fantastic Four is any indication we will. The new films PG rating and 92-minute running time make Silver Surfer highly marketable as a family movie though small children might be disturbed by a few violent sequences and an apparent reference to the ""ticking bomb"" argument for military torture. Silver Surfer has at least one advantage over the first installment Now that the tepid quartets origin myth has been established the screenwriting team (which incredibly includes a former Simpsons writer Don Payne) no longer has to spend the first hour drearily taxonomizing their various names nicknames and superpowers. But as the movies reviewer I guess I do Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) can stretch his body into any shape. Sue Storm the Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) can disappear and create force fields. Her brother Johnny the Human Torch (Chris Evans) can turn his whole body into a flaming missile. And Ben Grimm the Thing (Michael Chiklis) for some reason doesnt turn into anything He just is a superstrong rockpile-looking guy all the time. Having come to terms with their fantastic-ness in the first episode the Four now live together in the fabulous Baxter Building where theyre preparing for Reed and Sues upcoming wedding. Advertisement The only thing worse than rain on your wedding day is when just as youre about to exchange vows the entire globes existence is threatened by a planet-eating monster called Galactus. (Isnt it ironic?) This insatiable creature which resembles a giant tapeworm made of space dust is churning inexorably toward Earth snacking on Saturn along the way. But it sends an envoy in advance a melancholy naked guy on a surfboard whos made of the same liquid-mercury substance as the villain in Terminator 2. Exactly what the Silver Surfer must do to ready the Earth for consumption is unclear season it? Marinate it in a red-wine reduction? The important thing is the Four have eight days to figure out the source of the Surfers power neutralize it and save the world from destruction. As the new HBO series John From Cincinnati explores theres something about the very act of surfing that connotes an otherworldly mystery. The Silver Surfer looks marvelous navigating the skies on his board (though his Ken-doll bump of a pelvis is distracting--couldnt he have worn supershorts?). Laurence Fishburne voices the character in his best Matrix drone playing the intergalactic villain as a stoner guru who could easily carry a movie of his own. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. For a gang of superheroes though the Fantastics are kind of underachieving. The impending apocalypse doesnt prevent them from spending long stretches of screen time bickering and the closest any of them comes to a catchphrase is the Things oft-repeated ""Ah crap"" Even encased in a foam-rubber suit Michael Chiklis manages to give the Thing a nice lumpen sadness his watery blue eyes peering forlornly from behind the rocklike mask. But as the Human Torch Chris Evans is so forgettable Ive had to look his name up three times in the course of writing this review. Jessica Alba whose blank cushiony face and pneumatic body make her the very template of the Maxim girl has honed her acting skills since the first F4 movie. Shes still awful but not laughably awful; she might be able to pull off a self-mocking turn as a Bond girl for example an Ursula Andress to Daniel Craigs Sean Connery. But the poor child has zero chemistry with slim cerebral Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd who looks uncomfortable to the point of sheepishness as Mr. Fantastic. Gruffudd was great in the British miniseries The Forsyte Saga and the recent film The TV Set. If he has any career savvy (let alone shame) hes calling his agent right now trying to get out of Fantastic Four III They Call Her She-Hulk.

"Surfs up | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSurfs upRise of the Silver Surfer is a vast and significant improvement over the first instalment - if not quite ""fantastic"" then the next best thing It does not suck.By Rob SalemTelevision CriticFri. June 15 2007 Starring Ioan Gruffudd Jessica Alba Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis. Story by John Turman and Mark Frost. Screenplay by Don Payne and Mark Frost.Directed by Tim Story. 92 minutes. At major theatres. PG Article Continued Below Ho-hum. Yet another sequel to yet another comic-book movie. Colourful costumes. Fabulous toys. Big explosions. Planetary peril. Yadda yadda yadda. Pass the popcorn.But comics geeks take this stuff very seriously. Particularly when they are based on such influential enduring adored characters as Marvel Comics Fantastic Four.And even more particularly when just two years ago the first movie so completely screwed it up.But heres the surprise Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is a vast and significant improvement - if not quite ""fantastic"" then the next best thing It does not suck. This is not the way it tends to go. In cinematic terms the best part of any superhero saga has usually been the original story - the cosmic coincidence the unlikely accident the dead parental figure the rocketing to Earth as an alien infant ... from that point on it is pretty much reduced to beating the snot out of the villain or more often villains learning a valuable life lesson and flying off into the sunset.But the Fantastic Four have always been a little different even back to their comic-book origins as envisioned by Stan Lee and the late great Jack Kirby in the early 1960s. They remain as they were then a bickering somewhat dysfunctional family as opposed to the more traditional quippy comrades-in-arms. They dont even have secret identities - leaving themselves open to all the negative trappings of superhero celebrity. And it is that aspect of their high-profile lifestyle that the FF are dealing with at the beginning of Rise of the Silver Surfer. Unaware that the end of life as we know it is streaking toward them from across the galaxy the Four are pre-occupied with the upcoming - and thrice-delayed - nuptials of Mr. Fantastic the stretchy scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and the Invisible Girl Sue Storm (Jessica Alba).Meanwhile (a time-honoured comic-book transitional device) out in space a shiny silver something is circling the Earth reduntantly messing with our weather and leaving large gaping holes in the landscape.This is the Silver Surfer one of comicdoms coolest conflicted characters perfectly portrayed by the digitized body of veteran feature creature Doug Jones (Hellboy Pans Labyrinth) with the sonorous voice of Matrix master Laurence Fishburne.The Surfers sad fate is to act as ""herald"" for the planet-eating behemoth Galactus. Here we go ... the one thing the hardcore fans are going to latch onto as a major departure from the comics. The Kirby Galactus was a space-dwelling giant in ornate purple armour and a helmet resembling a hood ornament - the Chrysler building with arms and legs. The movie Galactus is essentially just this great big honking cosmic cloud. But disgruntled fans will have to take my word that there is enough of an homage to Kirbys creation to satisfy even their high expectations. And a big purple guy hovering menacingly over the New York skyline is just not gonna cut it movie-wise. This is as close to the comic book as anyone could ever come. You eventually warmed up to Michael Keaton as Batman. You ultimately conceded the limited cinematic appeal of Wolverines yellow-and-blue comics ensemble. You even managed to semi-accept the notion that Spider-Mans webs are organic not mechanical.This is not that big a leap. And you get a really cool Fantasti-Car.Our heroes have settled nicely into their roles and even look better than they did in the first movie with Reed Richards more convincingly stretchy - theres a hilarious bachelor-party dance scene to prove it - and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) more believably flaming (and thats just for starters but youve seen the commercials). The most significant makeover is Michael Chilkiss rocky orange Thing which is more streamlined defined (cut? carved? chiseled?) and facially expressive than before allowing the actor to make the big galoot almost adorable.But not too adorable - not while there is still clobberin to be done.And rest assured there is clobberin and on a grand scale.

"Fanstastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fanstastic-four-rise-of-the-silver-surfer ) Fanstastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Be careful what you wish for you may get ita| For non comic book fans over the age of 13 Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is a tedious incoherent bore. For comic book fans of any age it is an atrocity - the cinematic desecration of one of the most storied and beloved of Marvel comic book epics. It reduces iconic characters to soulless special effects and turns one of the most ominous and dangerous of all villains into an interplanetary storm cloud. The action of which there is little is predictable and unexciting. The so-called ""drama"" of which there is far too much is painful. Soap opera writers would be embarrassed to script such drivel. Then theres the overlay of ""comedy"" which is intended to reflect the superheroes comic book origins except its not funny and it makes the Fantastic Four seem more like the Four Stooges than a quartet of world saviors. For a story that has been kicking around in one form or another in Hollywood for 30 years (at one point it was to have starred Olivia Newton-John as the Silver Surfers girlfriend) its discouraging that this is the best the filmmakers could divine. Bring on Galactus I advised during my review of the underwhelming first Fantastic Four movie. Well they brought him on and promptly dissed him. Hes not much of a presence in the film always hovering out of sight if not entirely out of mind. And when it comes time for the big ""reveal"" the word ""underwhelming"" doesnt do the experience justice. Granted the Galactus of the comic books with his bright purple suit and ridiculous helmet might have looked a little silly on the big screen but his stand-in is a huge disappointment. To quote Star Trek The Motion Picture which also featured a space cloud heading for Earth ""Is that all there is? Is there nothing more?"" When the movie opens Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are trying to get married. But their nuptial plans are interrupted when a celestial traveler called the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones voice of Laurence Fishburne) arrives at Earth to prepare it as the next meal for his planet devouring master Galactus. His arrival awakens Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) who manages through nefarious means to be named the lead scientist on a government project studying the Surfer and his board. Reed Sue and the other members of their quartet Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkis) find their best efforts to stop the Surfer to be futile and every time they fail Galactus looms ever closer. Director Tim Story who also helmed 2005s Fantastic Four seems convinced that the movie must be pitched to pre-teens. Theres something unsettling about a superhero movie carrying a PG rating. There are plenty of special effects but the action sequences (which include a soaring flight past New York skyscrapers and a chase featuring a souped-up Dodge - talk about a product placement) could have been lifted from a video game and the characterization is atrocious. Story is creating a product and he has lost sight of everything that makes the Fantastic Four beloved by fans. I cant say this is the worst comic book superhero movie to grace the silver screen but its in the dregs (and this series hasnt even reached 3 yet). The acting is almost uniformly cringe-inducing. If not for his work in Amazing Grace I would be convinced that Ioan Gruffudd has no talent whatsoever. Jessica Alba makes love to the camera with her looks but no amount of physical beauty can camouflage the fact that she cant act. (The guy sitting next to me kept murmuring ""Shes hot"" not ""What an actress"" That I suppose is the point.) Nip/Tucks Julian McMahon froths at the mouth so energetically that one wonders if he has rabies. Stripped of his Shield and trapped under foam and latex Michael Chilkis comes close to making Ben Grimm a sympathetic figure until bad jokes get in the way. And Chris Evans is simply annoying even though he has what comes closest to a character arc. This movie is a mess. Its as if the script was cobbled together in a rush then changed during filming. The ending in addition to being a letdown is nonsensical. A lot of what happens in the film including the re-introduction of Dr. Doom feels completely arbitrary. What does it say about a major motion picture when the Stan Lee cameo is the highlight? (That was the only time when I smiled.) Rise of the Silver Surfer is only 90 minutes long but it seems as protracted and pointless as anything else this summer has had to offer. I can see how there might be some disposable appeal here for an audience that doesnt care much about whats unfolding on the screen. Yet Rise of the Silver Surfer is so lackluster it makes Spider-Man 3 feel like a masterpiece by comparison. Peter Parker has more personality than all four of this films heroes combined. And thats sad because The Fantastic Four deserve better. I was willing to forgive the series its mediocre first entry because origin stories are always hamstrung but theres no excuse for this. Rise of the Silver Surfer is an insult to comic book aficionados and movie lovers alike. Those who know and love the Fantastic Four will curse Tim Story and 20th Century Fox as they leave multiplexes shaking their heads in disgust.

In Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) encounters the Silver Surfer. Photo 20th Century Fox Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Superman wears panties and Spider-Mans a geek but is any superhero anyone at all goofier than the Fantastic Four? A stretchy nerd. A womanizer who spontaneously combusts. A guy made out of orange rock. (Why orange exactly? Was black taken?) A sometimes invisible gal who projects force fields by looking worried and spazzing out her hands. She also at times tends to lose her clothes. But nothing about the Fantastic Four ever veers too far from the dweeby and the wholesome even when the flambe Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) joshes the metamorphic Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) about making whoopee with his girlfriend. They bicker too much and half the time I wish they would just shut up and save the world already. Still they deserved better treatment than they got in director Tim Storys first pass at them 2005s Fantastic Four whose low point featured an elongated arm grabbing a roll of toilet paper. There are some imaginary places viewers just dont want to go and thats into the john with Mr. Fantastic. In Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer our heroes get what they deserve a decent action flick with a jolt of visual wow. Mr. Fantastic again performs his Gumby-man contortions this time to stow his briefcase overhead while flying coach. He also does a breathtaking bungee-wraparound maneuver on Londons Millennium Wheel during a showdown with the metallic itinerant of the title the latest computerized surfer (after Cody the penguin in Surfs Up) to hit the waves cosmic or otherwise this summer. The Silver Surfer is an important addition because he is as inherently and mystically cool as the Fantastic Four are inherently and prosaically flaky. His coolness is less the result of flatware polish (though he tarnishes when weakened) than his tragic and enigmatic exile from all that he knows and loves. In the Marvel universe of superheroes hes the dude without a planet. The Fantastic Four are of course homegrown earthlings who acquired their wacky powers by accident a back story covered in Storys first film and Roger Cormans infamous unreleased 1994 adaptation. Storys new film picks up where his earlier one left off with Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) now preparing to wed invisible gal Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) Johnnys sister. Two forces threaten their bliss. One is the Silver Surfer (thats the voice of Laurence Fishburne and the body more or less of CGI creature specialist Doug Jones) who arrives as a herald for a ravenous interstellar planet eater called Galactus rendered here as a black smog with claws. The other is Victor Von Doom (Nip/Tucks Julian McMahon) who awakens from suspended animation with some fool idea of world domination. An American general (Andre Braugher) recruits the Four for help in vanquishing the Surfer who jostles Johnnys molecules until he absorbs his colleagues powers just by touching them. The effects are arresting the plot hops continents and the acting is what it needs to be OK. Gruffudd croaks out lines like ""Im one of the greatest minds of the 21st century"" without laughing. The film doesnt ""reinvent"" the comic-movie genre in the manner now expected of jumpsuit-and-codpiece sagas but it does stay true to the FFs roots in benignly dysfunctional family dynamics. When Stan Lee (who makes a darling cameo) and Jack Kirby first conceived them in 1961 they were a new thing a squabbling superhero collective that didnt shrink from the masses incognito. From the start they were goofballs but they were our goofballs. And so they remain. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals KitchenAid Small Kitchen Appliances at eBay Up to 51% off +...

Only duty keeps tugging at Reed Richards and Sue Storms superhero personas Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. Power surges and climate shifts are vexing the planet Lakes freeze solid beneath trawlers; the Great Sphinx gets a dusting of snow; massive power outages put the West Coast on lockdown. The U.S. military in the gruff-enough guise of Gen. Hager (Andre Braugher racing through pap) is on the case. Each of these events is preceded by a streaking light that resembles a comet. Its not. As disconcerting as these goings-on are TV newscasters cant help breathlessly following them with frothing coverage of the ""Fantastic Wedding."" Written by Don Payne and Mark Frost and directed by Tim Story ""Fantastic Four"" wrestles ever so gently with an off-kilter world in which global threats are treated as lead-ins to the more important news of the day a celebrity jailing ... ahem ... wedding. Our poor superheroes. They cant seem to escape the kryptonite of our cultural obsessions. If its not the problems (and spoils) of unsought fame its the familiar fretting about bringing children into an already complicated relationship. Still who really cares that Reed finally loosens up on the dance floor with a couple of hotties at a bachelor party? The visual joke might have been funnier had the sight of the uptight researcher going all rubbery not been so fake. Should we really take comfort in the fact that Susan has pre-wedding jitters and the requisite prenup pimple? Are superpowers an appropriate substitute for Clearasil? For the target audience of this PG-rated flick the answers may be ""yes."" Only at some point dont we want our superheroes to be a little less like us and a little more well super? Enough with their human dimension already. ""Rise"" exhibits more storytelling balance than this springs other superhero soap opera ""Spider-Man 3"" where the courtship of Peter and Mary Jane bored in the way that only overly sincere adolescent love stories can. Which brings us to the Silver Surfer. A muscular silent type (Laurence Fishburne provides the voice) hes not your typical chattering baddie. Catching waves of air on his platinum board hes the harbinger who comes before planets are annihilated. Is he evil or merely destructive? His ambiguity is the one nice surprise in an otherwise familiar outing. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) returns to provide the hubris and bitter wisecracks of a comic-book arch-villain. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is better than its juvenile predecessor. Though saying so recalls something Julia Roberts once quipped in connection to ""Oceans Eleven"" In revisiting mediocre films you cant do too bad by them. Michael Chilkis man of stone The Thing is less shy about his appearance this time round. Kerry Washington continues to intrigue as his love. If youre just tuning in for this episode Love isnt blind she is. An initial tussle with the Silver Surfer makes the Human Torch (Chris Evans) contagious. Whenever one of his colleagues touches him they temporarily pick up his fiery trait and he theirs. After the Torch and the Invisible Woman touch she eventually winds up on the street in the buff. Its a gag from the first movie. ""Why does this always happen to me?"" she asks. Because youre Jessica Alba silly. Ioan Gruffudd has learned to relax into the larky fun this type of gig affords actors. Granted Reeds a serious scientist with a workaholics attachment to his PDA but Gruffudd now flips the switch between a severe grimace - the world is ending Ive got to do some calculations - and an ""Im with Alba"" grin. Much the way their characters have gained some dimension since last they saved Earth the actors are finding their chemistry. Is it fantastic? No. But it is summer-serviceable.

"Four superheroes one inconsequential film - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Four superheroes one inconsequential film By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 15 2007 You have to give the people cranking out these ""Fantastic Four"" movies credit. They know some of their audience extremely well. The early dilemma in ""Rise of the Silver Surfer "" (installment two opening everywhere today) is this Save the world or marry Jessica Alba . Your conscience says ""Save the world."" But the Maxim reader in you knows better.And so Reed Richards the bio physicist with the elastic body played by Ioan Gruffudd  proceeds to head down the aisle with his sometimes invisible girlfriend Sue Storm played by Alba. Meanwhile the planet is engulfed in a major ""global disturbance"" in which the movies special-effects department has fun creating massive conical orifices in such places as the dry bed of the Thames.To be fair Reed winds up building a device that tracks down the source of the disturbance. But that this movie would even try to drum up a dilemma for Reed however comic speaks to the dopiness of this flimsy series its ""Yes Dear"" in tights.The disturbance happens to be the Silver Surfer from outer space. Hes part special effect part dude in a suit -- to be precise its Doug Jones  who also embodied the demanding faun in ""Pans Labyrinth ."" The Surfer rides a matching board looks like a really fit SAG Award speaks in Laurence Fishburnes voice and has basically come in peace. Hes only following orders to season Earth to be eaten by an omnipotent dust cloud whom fans of the Marvel Universe -- and Fantastic Four issue 48 I believe -- will know as the entity Galactus. The Surfer and his own dilemma are a fine addition to this series. He exposes everything around him as shallow.Could there be a more inconsequential superhero blockbuster than the Fantastic Four? These are flavorless unbearably light movies lighter than ""X-Men "" ""Superman "" ""Batman "" and ""Spider-Man "" lighter than paper thinner than air. Lightness might be the filmmakers mark of distinction an antidote for the crises of identity and existence in those other movies. But the stakes are so intentionally low that there is nothing to care about. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" revels in the celebrity of its four heroes -- Reed and Sues nuptials are ""the wedding of the century"" But no one involved has the satirical chops to say anything witty or new.The Marvel comic book this movie is based on was never as sitcom-ish as the two films its inspired. ""The Fantastic Four"" with its quartet of earthlings turned superhuman wed scientific data and family dynamics into a world of life-size concerns often played out on a galactic scale. The comic was rarely as ludicrous as it seemed or as it sometimes should have been. This made it square but it made it solid too. A fan could rely on its commitment to intelligent story arcs and absorbingly drawn action.I suppose the only way to go with an expensive movie adaptation was to dumb it down gratuitously set it in key international markets (the big showdown here is in China) and wink. But tongue scarcely touches cheek in these two movies which Tim Story has directed with patchy fits of competence. For ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" Julian McMahon playing the thorn in the gangs side Dr. Doom goes for camp. He looks ready to burst into a number from ""The Phantom of the Opera."" But his one louche mood doesnt cut it.As Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm Michael Chiklis appears to have the hang of his bulky orange costume but if its possible his growling dialogue is more embarrassingly Kramdenesque than in the first movie. ""Ill show you a rock slide"" is yea-close to ""To the moon"" His Norton is Chris Evanss Human Torch and like many fresh one-note character tics his surprising conceited sarcasm from the first movie has stiffened into shtick. But he does raise some burning -- sorry -- questions about how Ben and his girlfriend (Kerry Washington luminous but thankless again) manage to make love.This leaves the rise of the Silver Surfer itself as the movies only remotely interesting development. He causes the gang to switch powers occasionally which is enjoyable. But its his infinite sadness that sticks with you. This shiny synthetic creature is more human than anyone else here.

Taika Waititis endearingly odd romantic comedy takes a good while to move outdoors from the fast-food restaurants video arcades shopping malls and multiplexes that constitute the unnatural habitat of its preternaturally shy lovers. Still other beauties emerge even though one of the lovers suffers from deeper-than-comical alienation and the other from life-threatening naivete. ENLARGE The title comes from costumes that the unmatched pair of misfits wear to an anguishingly tacky dress-as-your-favorite-animal party. Jemaine Clements Jarrod a depressed video clerk (is there any other kind?) shows up as a forlorn bird of prey. Lily a lonely fast-food waitress played superbly by Loren Horsley is the winsome incarnation of a slack-jawed Jaws. This debut feature occasionally arch but consistently affecting shares the deadpan esthetic of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Ghost World."" Its funny and sad in equal measure when Jarrod who can barely make eye contact with Lily let alone sustain it announces airily ""I used to be a bit of a nerd."" Its charmingly ludicrous when he tells her that hes often mistaken for Hugh Jackman. (She could be readily mistaken for the Audrey Tautou of ""Amelie."") Yet ""Eagle vs Shark"" has its own distinctive style partly thanks to whimsical little interludes of animation but mainly because it ties blithe absurdity to a rock bed of emotional truth. ENLARGE Jemaine Clement and Loren Horsley play a pair of misfits in Eagle vs Shark. The truth about Jarrod has to do with the plausible notion of depression as anger turned inward with nowhere to go. Napoleon Dynamite was an angry young man but his anger was diffused by his dorkiness. Jarrod is a rageful young man. Obsessed with taking revenge on a former classmate who used to bully him in school he swings between scary and hilarious. If this werent a comedy and a good one we could be watching the evolution of a random shooter. The truth about Lily is bottomless need. We see a radiant beauty with wide eyes and a cockeyed smile that could melt -- that does melt -- the hardest heart. Lily an orphan living with her older brother sees herself as undesirable yet she keeps hoping for the better if not the best. Lily is the movies heart open and heedlessly giving. ""Life"" she says ""is full of hard bits but in between them is some lovely bits."" The movie is full of lovely bits and in between them is a story about people paralyzed by anger and stored-up hurts. (The only character whos literally paralyzed is anger-free.) Although ""Eagle vs Shark"" was developed at the Sundance Directors and Screenwriters Lab the filmmaker Taika Waititi is well known in his native New Zealand as an actor and stand-up comic. Hell be known better and more widely very soon. Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer ""Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer"" manages to make human actors look computer-generated. Its quite intentional and part of a cheerful self-parodying strategy that works very nicely until just like that the whole movie goes kerplop. ENLARGE The Silver Surfer the reluctant villain of Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer When last we saw the Fantastic Four in the 2005 film of the same name they were silly people with extravagant superpowers in a conventional action adventure. Now they must contend with a new element in their lives -- family values. Jessica Albas Sue Storm aka Invisible Woman is about to be married quite visibly to Ioan Gruffudds super smart Reed Richards aka the elastic Mr. Fantastic who makes a specialty of being extensible. And just as wedding bells are threatening to break up that old gang from Marvel Comics the Silver Surfer of this title -- a reluctant villain who sometimes verges on the pewter -- shows up as an energy-sucking herald of Earths destruction. What follows is good fun -- more fun than in the original -- punctuated by some lines of admirable awfulness. Among my favorites are Reeds joyous declaration ""Im one of the greatest minds of the 21st century and Im engaged to the hottest girl on the planet""; Sues lament that ""We cant even have a wedding without it turning into World War Three"" and the Silver Surfers laconic warning that ""All you know is at an end."" Nevertheless the film fails to sustain its modest running time of 87 minutes. Somewhere around the 70-minute mark all the filmmakers know is at an end.    DVD TIP One of the producers of ""Eagle vs Shark"" Cliff Curtis is also one of New Zealands most powerful actors. And one of the many films hes been in ""Once Were Warriors"" (1994) is one of the best that New Zealand has given the world. Its the stirring shockingly violent story of a Maori family struggling to survive in urban poverty. Lee Tamahori directed from Riwia Browns adaptation of Alan Duffs novel.

And as summer franchise superhero flicks go its mostly tolerable. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 15 2007 Save for later Saved Most sentient people would agree that the first ""Fantastic Four"" movie released in 2005 was not a masterpiece for the ages. Nevertheless it had a theatrical gross of 330 million and was one of Twentieth Century Foxs biggest DVD titles of all time.Not surprisingly we now are faced with a sequel ""Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer"" and it will probably reap a fresh fortune. As summer franchise superhero flicks go its tolerable.The big draw this time around is the Silver Surfer one of the great Marvel comics creations. He looks like one of the Spartans from ""300"" dipped in a vat of silver paint. Surfing the universe while absorbing its cosmic energies hes just about indestructible. As the emissary of ubervillain Galactus hes on the lookout for new planets to conquer. Like for example Earth. The Fantastic Four are on the front lines but theres not a lot they can do against the Silver Surfer which makes for a lopsided series of confrontations. Also the Four have become more human-scaled which leaves them at a disadvantage against the likes of Galactus. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Sue Storm (Jessica Alba tanned to a fine shade of butterscotch) wants to marry the Fours leader Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) start a family and lead a normal life. This is not as easy as it sounds since (a) she can instantly dematerialize herself and hes as stretchy as human taffy and (b) they are constantly being pursued by tabloid journalists. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Also struggling with normality is Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) the human boulder pile who is in a lovey-dovey relationship with a blind sculptress. Human Torch Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) Sues brother is as rakish as ever. The scene in which he stages a bachelor party for Reed should have been a lot more inventive. Reed performs a few slinky sub-Travolta moves on the dance floor with some hotties and thats about it. Moments like these stand as a reminder that the target audience is teenage boys.I appreciated the occasional attempt by director Tim Story and screenwriter Don Payne to reach out to adults. Some of the jokes are borderline sophisticated. The filmmakers also dont sell out the series in the spirit of wholesomeness. ""Who says you have to be normal to have a family?"" Sue concludes by the end. In other words get ready for ""Fantastic Four The Rise of the Open Relationship."" Grade B- Rated PG for sequences of action violence some mild language and innuendo.

"Four Adds Up to Zero washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Four Adds Up to Zero Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) encounter bad but misunderstood Surfer dude in ""Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer."" (By Diyah Pera -- Twentieth Century Fox Via Associated Pres) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 15 2007 Hey FTC WAKE UP Shouldnt some truth-in-advertising law require someone to rename ""Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer"" something like ""Zzzzzzzz"" or ""Yawn"" or what about ""See Paint Dry""? Isnt that your job? Surely the dullest of Hollywoods many comic-book-derived summer movies ""Silver Surfer"" is drearier than corn dying in the Iowa sun slower than molasses in Antarctica as grim as February in Rockville. Sentient humans should stay away; all others may enter confident that their IQs are already in the Chernobyl-fried range and will not be affected except for downward. So many flaws so little time. Hmmm we could waste a few minutes on the total absence of chemistry between the dweebs and dweebette known as ""The Fantastic Four"" and if you still want to go with ""Fantastic"" maybe theres a lawsuit in your future. Or maybe we could try to discern whose eyes are deader poor dim thick Jessica Alba as Invisible Woman who looks as if she got a concussion on the field hockey meadow from some 300-pound hormonally confused midfielder with a grudge or Michael Chiklis laboring under 700 pounds of rock disguise as The Thing (he looks like the landscape in ""From the Earth to the Moon""). Or what about Actual Actor Ioan Gruffudd hiding his Welsh gravitas behind a cheesy Yank accent as Mr. Fantastic affecting the enthusiasms of a Real Smart Science Guy Who Turns to Rubber. Then theres the schadenfreude dimension by which the afflictions of the talented are always worth a chuckle or two as in the rich misfortune of actor Andre Braugher and writer-producer Mark Frost who once revivified TV with great work on ""Homicide"" and ""Twin Peaks"" respectively and are now reduced to degradation on this piffle of a kerfuffle of a flopola of a trifle. Hollywood so cruel so ugly so destructive. God I love that filthy town But no Lets go straight to the most important summer issue the issue of design. As a concocter of fanciful machines ominous labs thrilling action sequences and potential ends of days ""Silver Surfer"" isnt a dud; its a Milk Dud a blank a misfire a bang that went poof. Visually the movie is dead on arrival. Heres an example It turns out that Fantastic Four hotshot leader Reed Richards (Gruffudd) has built a secret vehicle by which to transport the four supermutants around the world to deal with various crises. We see it in his lab -- the lab looks like the lobby of a Club Med in the 70s and you could almost smell the disinfectant slathered on the floor -- under a sheet and when dork-o-mensch Chiklis reaches to pull the sheet off (or maybe its mousse-lacquered almost-irrelevant flameboy Johnny Storm a.k.a. Human Torch played by a haircut named Chris Evans) hes stopped. ""No peeking crust-face"" Thats called a tease. The movie plays this game What is under the sheet? What oh what does this magical contrivance look like? Oh the movie makes us wait and wait and wait. Could it look like a pumpkin? A bullet? A spaceship? A comet? A dogs nose? A womans breast? A popsicle? A fish taco? John Waynes left thumb? No it looks like . . . nothing. Its just some cheesy piece of saucer thing with a batch of 30s-style open cockpits. It looks like a Porsche Boxster crossed with a CrisCraft and has the personality of a piece of Tupperware. Its utterly uninteresting. And with those open cockpits how fast can it go? Seventy? Hey maybe 100 miles per hour CONTINUED 1 <a href=""http//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061402343_2.html"">2</a> <a href=""http//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061402343_2.html"">Next</a> gt; (c) 2007 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061402343.html,200,fantasticfour(2005)16,fantasticfour(2005),washingtonpost

The world could just pay this fellow to sail over the trouble spots - Greenland Antarctica Washington - and re-freeze the melting caps dump tons of white stuff on the dunderheads and make the polar bears happy again. Sadly thats not what the Silver Surfer has come to do. Hes come to ruin Reed Richards and Sue Storms wedding for one thing. And destroy Earth. Reed a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue a.k.a. Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are about to say their vows on a Manhattan roof when a massive power failure wrecks everything. The couple stop in mid-""I do"" to save their guests from being mussed in the mayhem. And then they have to team up with their partners - Johnny Storm a.k.a. Human Torch a.k.a. Sues obnoxious brother (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm a.k.a. The Thing (Michael Chiklis) - to figure out who this cosmic stranger is and why hes wreaking havoc on their nuptials and the world. They could have read old issues of Marvel Comics to find out. Although FFROTSS comes from the same place as Spider-Man (New York and Marvel editor Stan Lees noggin) this sequel to the 2005 Fantastic Four debut is lackluster even by comparison to the lackluster Spider-Man 3. Yes the freaky-powered foursome sport cool blue jumpsuits and Reed a genius geek has built a flying car that boasts spiffy features (it flies and flies apart into modular mini-cars). And Alba with a blond dye job and enormous blue contact lenses is an eyeful. But if anyone believes for a second that Reed and Sue are madly in love struggling to balance their personal and professional lives while staving off a phalanx of paparazzi hot on their superhero celebrity trail - well even Gruffudd and Alba seem to be having trouble believing it. Richards may be ""the greatest scientist of the 21st century"" but hes failing chemistry right before our eyes. There isnt any between these two stars. Meanwhile Evans as the hot-headed egotistical Johnny Storm succeeds in being rude and repugnant but not necessarily amusingly so. And Chiklis does his emoting under a giant lava-caked fatsuit. A joke about squeezing into a row of coach-class seats is as clever as things get for the dermatologically-challenged burnt sienna hulk. As for the Silver Surfer as voiced by Laurence Fishburne (intoning gravely) the glistening chrome figure is a combination of Pans Labyrinths ""Pale Man"" Doug Jones body and a mess of digital effects. He dives hovers and zooms around the universe on his cosmic board looking soulful and solemn and doing the evil bidding of someone called Galactus. And then theres Victor Von Doom (nip/tucks Julian McMahon) the Fantastic Fours longtime nemesis who covets the surfboard for himself. Ostensibly to save the planet Doom aligns himself with the Four. He is not to be trusted. Nor are the credited writers who summon slews of comic-book cliches but not a single fresh wisecrack to go with them. The closest FFROTSS gets to wit is when Johnny convinces a reluctant Reed to attend a bachelor party after promising the uptight groom-to-be that there wont be any ""exotic dancers."" When a bevy of tarted-up babes attach themselves to the rubber-limbed Reed (thats his super-power elasticity) Johnny explains ""theyre not exotic dancers theyre just hot."" Actually thats not terribly funny either.

At a time when tortured superheroes like Spider-Man Superman and Batman would benefit from some serious psychotherapy its almost refreshing to see a comicbook caper as blithe weightless and cheerfully dumb as ""Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer."" Faithfully mining one of the Marvel franchises more intriguing mythologies the sequel proves every bit as disposable as its predecessor with even less character definition and several tons more poundage in the f/x department. Original grossed a surprising 330 million worldwide and ""Silver Surfer"" should ride a heady wave of fan nostalgia and an audience-friendly PG rating to similarly golden returns. Its always a drag when the threat of apocalyptic doom intrudes on ones personal life as Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are about to realize. Publicly known as Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman respectively the Gotham scientists-turned-lovers are now planning a splashy celebrity wedding. But to Sues frustration Reed is constantly distracted by reports of what appears to be a giant comet circling the globe causing snowstorms blackouts and all manner of meteorological mayhem. After a strike on New York disrupts the wedding (in the first of many set pieces entailing the destruction of buildings and aircraft) its clearly a case for the Fantastic Four -- rounded out by Sues reckless brother Johnny (Chris Evans) aka the Human Torch and the rock-bodied super-strong fighter Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis). Villain turns out to be the enigmatic Silver Surfer a metal-based intergalactic traveler (sonorously voiced by Laurence Fishburne) whos left a trail of dead planets in his wake. To stop the gnarly destroyer the foursome will have to contend with a surly U.S. Army general (Andre Braugher) and in an even more unpleasant development the unsubtly monikered Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) having escaped his frozen captivity from the first film. A gleaming marvel of 3-D animation the Silver Surfer (who from certain angles resembles an iridescent shop manikin or a wicked-cool hood ornament) will deservedly command most of the attention here. Comicbook fans in particular will be pleased to know the characters mysterious origins and more-complicated-than-meets-the-eye motivations have been left gratifyingly intact giving the pic a stronger narrative thrust than the first films more straightforward origin story. That somewhat offsets the sad fact that the Fantastic Four themselves have even less dramatic stature this time around as scribes Mark Frost and Don Payne fail to develop them beyond the requisite one trait apiece. Thus Gruffudds Reed is still a lovable geek. Evans Johnny is still a self-aggrandizing horndog. Albas Sue is still um pretty. And Chiklis Ben the only figure who showed any semblance of a soul in the first place is here reduced to belching comic relief. To some extent the noncommital perfs lazy dialogue and retro-cheesy visual effects could be chalked up to the pics refusal to take itself too seriously; one would be hard-pressed to recall the last time the apocalypse was treated this breezily onscreen. But at a certain point even the most popcorn-hungry moviegoers may find themselves craving something in the way of real dramatic stakes. To defend ""Fantastic Four"" on the grounds that it is unpretentious is to make too generous an excuse. Back in the directors chair Tim Story ensures the pics stylistic consistency with its predecessor though the finale -- with its images of the Earth beset by cataclysmic forces -- suffers from visual bloat. F/x work overall is a mixed bag lacking the polish and seamless integration most auds have come to expect from superhero extravaganzas. Globe-trotting sequel could set a record for most international landmarks damaged in the course of a 11/2-hour action movie laying waste to the River Thames the London Eye and the Great Wall of China for starters.

Starring Ioan Gruffudd Jessica Alba Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans. Directed by Tim Story. (PG. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies Something has happened to Jessica Alba in the past two years. It would be too much to say that she has learned how to act but she has definitely stopped doing that thing she did throughout the previous ""Fantastic Four"" movie. You know that thing in which shed speak a line and then look around nervously to see if shed fooled anybody? Alba doesnt do that anymore. Shes just fine now -- and so is the new ""Fantastic Four"" movie. To say that ""Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is better than the original isnt enough. The last one was awful one of the worst movies of its year while the new one is a pleasure one of the most enjoyable pictures of the season. The last ""Fantastic Four"" was 106 minutes of water torture. The new one instead of expanding in length clocks in at a streamlined 92 minutes but nothing about it seems truncated or small-scale. The stakes and the scope are tremendous and yet the movie doesnt wallow in either. Director Tim Story and writers Don Payne and Mark Frost are at all times telling the story moving the action forward. They do so from the first seconds Something that looks like a meteor is flying all over the world confounding weather patterns. In Japan the sea turns to ice and snow falls over the pyramids in Egypt. Electricity goes out all over Los Angeles and everywhere this energy ball goes it creates craters. Its strange enough that people start thinking this might be the end of the world. Come to think of it thats not a bad guess. Meanwhile everything is cozy with the Fantastic Four. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) the elastic man and group intellectual is about to marry Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) who can make herself invisible at will. (This means he must always be faithful -- think about it.) Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who is made of rock and looks like tree bark is still going steady with the lovely non-superhero Alicia (Kerry Washington). And Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) whose gimmick is to fly around while on fire is living the life of an eligible New York bachelor. They are urban dwellers like all superheroes and so when Reed and Sue opt for an outdoor wedding they hold it on a rooftop. Or maybe they do this out of plot convenience Before the rings are exchanged the meteor flies by -- only on closer look its not a meteor. Its a silver man on a silver surfboard who looks like an Oscar statuette in motion. He has access to a seemingly unstoppable supply of energy and hes sowing destruction everywhere. The Silver Surfer is played in body by Doug Jones and voiced by Laurence Fishburne and both do beautiful sensitive work -- its the performance to take from the movie. Yet much of the Silver Surfers movements and actions had to have been computer generated too. The interesting thing here is that the line between whats real and whats manufactured is almost never noticeable -- certainly its barely thought of. The illusion is complete. Its complete in all the key moments as well from the battle in London which endangers the Millennium Wheel to the outer-space scenes in which a creeping darkness threatens to cover the earth. About the only visual lapse in the picture is the blond wig that the dark-haired Alba wears to play Sue. Its even worse than the wig Kate Bosworth wore as Lois Lane in ""Superman Returns"" -- worse in that it might really be Albas hair. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) shows up too mean to die oozing menace and mendacity but fortunately the movie doesnt slow down for him. There are oblique attempts at making the film topical For example the Army brings in a torturer to interrogate an alien because the alien has no ""human"" rights. But the truth is ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" doesnt aspire to much. It just happens to have the three things it needs -- velocity artistry and a pretty good story. -- Advisory Imperiled action heroes.

With Jessica Alba Ioan Gruffudd Chris Evans Michael Chiklis. Director Tim Story (132). PG Action violence mild language and innuendo. At area theaters. Superheroes Reed Richards and Susan Storm appear on the front page of the Daily News in the superfun ""Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer."" And the headline reads ""Todays the Day."" Actually tomorrows the day - ""FF2"" will be shown after midnight tonight - but a wedding it promises and a wedding it delivers. The happy couple - and two prettier superheroes youve never seen - is played by Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd two of the four returning stars from the 2005 summer hit. As we join them and the other F4 heroes Chris Evans Johnny Storm and Michael Chiklis Ben Grimm theyre not just superheroes theyre tabloid superstars. Paparazzi fight for position to shoot them and helicopters hover overhead for the wedding ceremony on a Manhattan rooftop. That ceremony is the first of two as the F4s are interrupted by an end-of-the-world scenario involving a silver-skinned alien a surfboard a mysterious galactic destroyer and the Fours previous nemesis Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon). If you recall that Dr. Doom died at the end of the first film so do our heroes. But here he is recruited by the brash Army Gen. Hager (Andre Braugher) to help Reed unravel the mystery of the Silver Surfer who is poking huge craters in the Earth. Its never explained why Doom is still alive but its a good trick since hes likely to repeat it in ""FF3."" In the meantime its almost a surprise that the sequel is actually better - much better - than the original. The first film was wall-to-wall adolescent humor as director Tim Story struggled to introduce and shape his characters. The story and the characters seem more comfortable on this outing. The banter between the narcissistic Johnny and the rock-imprisoned Ben is reprised as is the sight gag where Susan Storm loses her invisibility while she is conveniently naked (not that were in a position to see it). The big improvements come in the action scenes in the battle between the F4 and the Silver Surfer who gets power from his surfboard that is greater than Johnnys fireflying Reeds elastic body Susans invisible force field and Bens strength. The Silver Surfer - played under metallic CGI effects by Doug Jones - is a cool invention sort of a cross between the morphing alien robot in ""Terminator 2"" and Gort the robot giant in the classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" He is also an alien with a heart vulnerable as Superman sitting on kryptonite. Scary but you learn to love the big lug. jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By David Germain updated 6/13/2007 53428 PM ET 2007-06-13T213428 Print Font + - REVIEW The filmmakers behind all these comic-book adaptations always insist they wont come back for more unless the sequels can top the originals. The ""Fantastic Four"" gang has managed to outdo itself the second time around -- and still make a bad movie. ""Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer"" exceeds the first movie mainly by the less-is-more approach. It offers fewer random displays of superpowers that characterized its predecessor keeping the action brisk and the running time 15 minutes shorter. That makes it less of a fantastic bore than 2005s ""Fantastic Four"" which became a commercial hit despite cheesy action and effects and dysfunctional infighting among its quartet of superheroes. The first flick suffered from a miserly story pitting the four astronauts-turned-mutated-heroes against one another in a sort of silly sibling rivalry then tossing in an aimless megalomaniac whose only goal was destroying the good guys. This time out the heroes have their act together if not their acting -- the performances are still as stiff thin and brittle as the paper their Marvel Comics source material was printed on. Theres a little more at stake in ""Silver Surfer"" -- the destruction of Earth -- though even that impending doom sometimes takes a back seat to the goofy interpersonal crises of the Fantastic Four. Our heroes all return with the powers they gained in the first film Brainiac leader of the pack Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) whose elasticity allows him to bend and stretch into any shape he wants; Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) who can make herself invisible and project force fields; her brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) able to fly and burst into flames; and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) a super-strong rocklike hulk. Advertise Advertise Advertise Also back is director Tim Story who has learned a thing or four about action since last time -- ""Silver Surfer"" shows definite improvement over the choppy fight sequences in the first movie. Their superhero cover blown in part one the Fantastic Four are caught in a tabloid-TV spectacle as Reed and Sues wedding approaches. The arrival of an interstellar harbinger of doom the Silver Surfer interrupts the nuptials and forces the Fantastic Four into reluctant alliance with their archenemy Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) who has metallic and electromagnetic powers and in some conveniently unexplained manner has returned from apparent destruction in the previous flick. The Surfer rides into town on a silvery surfboard blasting craters around the planet freezing entire seas and otherwise making a nuisance of himself. We gradually learn hes not the big cheese though; surfer boy is just the advance man leading a hungry entity known as Galactus to planets it can devour.

Every on-screen drink in Mad Men in 5 minutes See the Dancing stars most memorable moves Emmys biggest snubs? Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom To its credit ""Silver Surfer"" flows by quickly if brainlessly. The dialogue from screenwriters Don Payne and Mark Frost is so shallow it provokes unintended laughs (""Your encounter with the Surfer has affected your molecules"" Reed informs Johnny proving that not all eggheads have a way with big words). Amid all the vapid dialogue and visual fireworks the performances seem like afterthoughts particularly those of Gruffudd and Alba who could use a snap of the fingers by fiery Johnny to light a spark of personality within them. The cast also includes Kerry Washington returning as Bens sweet blind girlfriend; and Andre Braugher stuck in a bad Patton act as an Army general who enlists the help of the Fantastic Four. The Silver Surfer looks like the shape-shifting cyborg of ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" in his smooth shiny transition modes. Though Story and his crew were aiming to emulate the characters appearance in the comics theres not much room for expressiveness in a featureless creature that resembles a shopping-mall mannequin. Droopy vocals for the Surfer by Laurence Fishburne dont help either. Hes got energy enough to punch massive holes across the globe but the Surfer sounds as though he can barely keep awake. Doug Jones a mime who portrayed both the forest faun and the creepy Pale Man in last years ""Pans Labyrinth"" performed body movements that were used as the basis for the computer-generated Surfer which was crafted by Peter Jacksons Weta Digital effects outfit. Like the first movie the sequel closes with an image that could be a nugget for another installment. If the really bad first chapter can pack in enough fans to warrant a sequel theres no reason why the merely bad second one cannot do the same.
