"Captain America Civil War - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Captain America Civil War Posted by Christy Lemire on May 11 2016 23 Comments Walt Disney Pictures Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence action and mayhem. Running time 146 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. With ""Captain America Civil War"" directors Anthony and Joe Russo have found the tricky balance that eluded the ordinarily reliable Joss Whedon with last years ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" Theyve made a movie thats both self-referential and self-reverential thrilling and heady packed with giant set pieces and sly pop-culture quips in equal measure. Yes theres probably too much going on here too many characters too many subplots too many gears keeping the behemoth Marvel Cinematic Universe grinding ever forward toward world domination. And at nearly two and a half hours its a long sit -- although Nicolas at age 6 1/2 was thoroughly engaged the whole time. (Then again hes inordinately Marvel-savvy. Your mileage may differ.). But ""Civil War"" remains entertaining throughout even as it turns introspective. The Russos who also directed Chris Evans amp; Co. in the excellent ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" from 2014 have reteamed with the writers of that movie Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Like ""The Winter Soldier"" ""Civil War"" is relevant and resonant without becoming heavy-handed or self-serious the way oh say ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" did. Its got some intelligent important matters on its mind but also finds a way to deliver in terms of  summer thrills. Now I dont want to divulge too much in terms of plot. Id like to avoid spoilers for both of the people on the planet who havent seen ""Civil War"" yet. (For a spoiler-tastic review of the film please enjoy our What the Flick? discussion.) But I do want to touch on the main things the movie gets so right as well as the few it gets not quite right. An inadvertent deadly attack on an office building in Lagos Nigeria -- the result of the Avengers trying to do the right thing as usual -- prompts the U.S. government to question whether these superheroes should be allowed to continue functioning autonomously. A quick montage of the massive urban destruction that has occurred in the past few Marvel movies makes an awfully persuasive case Yes theyre using their powers for the greater good in all these instances but the collateral damage is undeniable. The fact that a Marvel movie dares to question the big shiny spectacle that is its bread and butter -- and acknowledge that untold thousands die in the name of entertainment -- seems rather novel. At the same time ""Civil War"" approaches this topic in brisk smart fashion rather than languishing in perpetually rainy philosophical doldrums the way Zack Snyders ""BvS"" did earlier this year. As the Avengers and their newfound allies take sides on the issue of whether to sign a treaty agreeing to international oversight or continue with their current strategy of world-saving no matter the cost its fascinating to see who falls where. It doesnt shake out the way you might expect; theres a bit of role reversal here. The typically brash billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) better known as Iron Man is surprisingly conservative when it comes to the groups use of power. Hes seen some things and thinks General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) has a point in seeking oversight and accountability. Meanwhile Evans Steve Rogers -- the earnest do-gooder Captain America -- takes an if-not-now-when if-not-us-who approach. He wants to maintain the status quo and refuses to sign. As Steves old childhood friend-turned-enemy Bucky (Sebastian Stan) returns from obscurity to unleash his full potential as the reprogrammed killing machine The Winter Soldier the Avengers must side with either Iron Man or Captain America as the latest and greatest threat to world peace looms ever larger. Were talking about a lot of people here folks -- so many that you may lose track of whos on which team in the midst of major battles. Maybe thats the point though -- the futility of war and whatnot. All I know is the next day Nicolas and I had a hard time recalling who was Team Cap and who was Team Iron Man. (Luckily the ubiquitous billboards throughout Los Angeles helped jog our memories.) Theres also the revelation of a deep secret that provides a surprisingly emotional underpinning to the ideological feud between Iron Man and Captain America. It arrives during a moment of beautiful dramatic in snowy Siberia and its the films most gorgeous memorable image (the work of cinematographer Trent Opaloch who also shot ""The Winter Soldier""). And thats about all I want to say about that. As for the performances -- because yes they do matter even in a blockbuster about comic-book heroes -- an enormous cast gets even bigger with the addition of characters from Marvel movies past and future. Everyone gets a brief moment to shine but its often tantalizing and perhaps not enough. Besides Evans and Downey -- who seem to feel these characters in the very fiber of their being by now -- theres also Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye Anthony Mackie as Falcon Paul Rudd as Ant-Man Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany as Vision. The tremendously versatile Chadwick Boseman whos already played Jackie Robinson (""42"") and James Brown (""Get On Up"") in just the past few years provides excitement both physically and emotionally as newcomer Black Panther -- and hell get his own movie directed by Ryan Coogler in 2018. But the best part of ""Civil War"" for me was the reintroduction of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. It is THE highlight of the movie. Tom Holland finds just the perfect tone as the webslinger whom weve seen in countless other incarnations. Tobey Maguire was quippy and Andrew Garfield was angry and both played this iconic role with varying degrees of success. Holland gets the boyish giddiness of having superpowers; his joy is infectious and his banter with Downey positively crackles. And unlike the Black Panther movie you only have to wait until next year for ""Spider-Man Homecoming."" Because regardless of how good any of these movies are individually theyre all just cogs in the massive Marvel machinery.

Miss Lemire? Your review seems positive but its still showing rotten on Rotten Tomatoes. Is there a mistake here or am I just confused? Also nice review. Reply May 11 2016  by  Christy Lemire     Ummm. Its fixed. You are one of many many thoughtful people who pointed out this discrepancy. But thanks (and thanks for reading) Reply July 7 2016  by  Josh     Its worth seeing just to hear Spiderman yell ""Holy sh1t"". Reply May 11 2016  by  jozielee     Just saw it and surprised how much I enjoyed it. Youre right loved the comedy - In the midst of battle Black Widow asks Hawk ""We are still friends arent we?"" ""Of course"" he replies. Yet theyre on opposite teams. Hahaha. As you said the movie was a tad long. Even while I enjoyed the action had to go the restroom but scared Id miss an important plot point I like many other folks in the theater waited. We missed the credits as many made a mad dash for the toilet. Great summer fare. Reply June 6 2016  by  Craig Berger     I think his reply was actually ""it depends on how hard you hit me."" Reply May 11 2016  by  Krishna     Without spoiling any of the major plot points I have one major issue with this movie - Being that Captain America is a man of the uniform who follows authority wouldnt he be on the political side that Iron Man took. And being a sort of anarchist who doesnt follow authority wouldnt Iron Man be on the opposite side of the political position he takes as we saw from previous Iron Man films. Apart from that it was a awesome fun summer movie. Reply May 12 2016  by  Jamie     I think this Cap lines up with the one we saw in Winter Soldier - one who believes in freedoms and ideals not government. Following Ultron I think this move only sort of makes sense for Tony given that his solution to ultron was to create another thing that could go bad Reply May 15 2016  by  Matt     I can only assume you have not seen Winter Soldier or Age of Ultron. The positions taken in this movie are a long time coming. You see the seeds of this in several movies. Stark is now the guy that wants to make everyone safe and will use any means to make it happen. Safety is the priority no matter the cost. Steve is the guy that doesnt trust anyone. He wants to keep the world safe but not at the cost of his or anyone elses freedom. Their positions have changed over time. There has been a role-reversal in many ways. I think it easy to see why a guy that jumped from 1940 to 2011 might be horrified about how for technology has come. The world we live in where there is almost no expectation of privacy has been gradual for us. For his character it was instantaneous. I think it all makes a lot of sense but thats just me. Reply May 16 2016  by  Fred     Nah. Tony Stark has been coming to this realization that there needs to be some sort of check in place for a while now. Especially after he was sort of responsible for Ultron existing in the first place. As for Cap he doesnt blindly follow authority. He is a champion of freedom and democracy above anything else. Being a patriot doesnt mean doing what your government tells you. Its the people who have the power not the government. We need leaders and decision makers in the political arena but the moment those decisions infringe on our rights is the moment we must take action. Of course there will always be room for argument over what those rights are exactly but it seems obvious Cap believes yet another government agency demanding private information and submission to their will is not something we would benefit from even if the end goal is a noble one. Reply May 28 2016  by  Son of Prometheus     Well said my brother  If you keep texting like this I might have to press Follow on your Twitter account (If you have one) Articulate amp; Insightful. ""Being a patriot doesnt mean doing what your government tells you to."" Damn I like that. Might have to put it on a t-shirt. Reply May 27 2016  by  RL     A writer on Vox addressed this issue pretty well I thought In defense of Captain America http//www.vox.com/2016/5/19/11700560/captain-america-civil-war-defense-captain-america Reply May 27 2016  by  jgfox     Are the rulings of the UN actually Law? Did any of the Avengers swear allegiance to the UN? When I was sworn into the US Army I took an oath to obey the orders of the President and those he delegate over us. I also was told in Basic training that I should not follow orders if indeed they were not lawful. We were instructed that no superior could instruct you to do something that was unlawful. ""I was only following orders"" could never be an excuse in the US Military. From what was done to those Avengers who dared to question the totalitarian rulings ... it was clear that the UN resolutions were not lawful ... just Ordnungs. Reply June 6 2016  by  Craig Berger     Its easier to buy if you read the book. Essentially Iron Man who has evolved from reckless womanizing alcoholic to taking Nick Furys top spot in SHIELD sees himself as a sort of patriarch for the hero community He knows whats best for them. Cap on the other hand loves his country and the freedoms it provides-freedoms which include autonomy from government interference wherever possible-not for him-hes a soldier but for his fellow superhumans whose only vow of service is to the innocents they have sworn to protect. Reply May 12 2016  by  Fred     Thanks for a great in depth review I thought Civil War was just superb. The thing with movies is there are different genres and there is always something for everyone in movies. This is not just a comic book film but an action film that has heart emotion humor great action sequences and visuals. Like Winter Soldier its darker than other MCU films and more complex but it still doesnt forget to be fun. I think Black Panther and Spider-Man were outstanding in their MCU debuts and their strong performances should leave many movie goers excited about their upcoming solo films. I think a lot of credit goes to the Russos and the writers for giving us a thoughtful CBM and not just some run of the mill market machine. Reply May 12 2016  by  jozielee     So agree with you Fred about Black Panther and SpiderMan. When Black Pather reveals his identity I gasped. Never even considered him as the culprit. And all those great toys he came with . . . wow. Then we see him with an entourage and know hes got bucks to support his enterprise. SpiderMan on the other hand were meeting as the boy wonder. Still in high school. Still under his Auntys thumb. Tom Hollanders awkward and bumbling characterization charmed.

The experience of the film was gloomy for the most part and I am not sure that is exactly what I want to see in a Marvel film. I think there is some truth when the reviewer says that the arguments of Captain America and Iron Man kept grinding through and became repetitive. However I agree - Spider-Man is the best thing that happened in the who film. He and Ant-Man were not only enjoyable characters but they even seemed to be the only characters who loved being a superhero (or being in the movie for that matter). My favorite thing plot-wise in this film was Black Panther. He was the only one in the film who seemed like he resolved his conflict. - I dont want to give away much - but I think he is the only one who was really redeemed from the whole ordeal as opposed to the other heroes who didnt seem to resolve anything at the end. In this sense Black Panther was inspiring to me because he was able to overcome and not give into his hate. This review was enlightening and gave the movie a little more clarity for me as a whole Reply June 9 2016  by  Edmund     Civil war is a great marvel movie with terrific action. The liepzig airport avengers action blitzkrieg is a thing of beauty; action nirvana spun with intricate webbing served up with a giant helping of comic book retrograde pastiche. However I find villain baron Zemos scenes boring and a stretch of willing suspension of disbelief. After the airport action extravanga I was looking for an even more rousing epic action finale; the smallness of the finale and slow burn of it left me disappointed. Movie was in fine feckle and soaring up until the rather tame finale. Excellent except for Zemo who is not as commandeering and action savvy as his nefarious comic roots counterpart.

By Anthony Lane Share Tweet Table of Contents Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz play forbidden lovers in Yorgos Lanthimoss film. Credit Illustration by Mikkel Sommer Timorous paunchy and pale with a sad mustache and a pair of rimless glasses David (Colin Farrell) checks into a rural hotel. He expects to remain for forty-five days and like the other guests--all of whom male and female are unattached--he must use the time to procure a suitable mate. Anyone who flunks that task will suffer an unusual penalty. As the hotel manager (Olivia Colman) says to David ""The fact that youll turn into an animal if you fail to fall in love with someone during your stay here is not something that should upset you or get you down. Just think as an animal youll have a second chance to find a companion."" She advises him that if transfigured he should limit his choice of sweetheart to the same species. ""A wolf and a penguin could never live together nor could a camel and a hippopotamus"" she says. After a moment she adds ""That would be absurd."" As if everything else she has mentioned is utterly normal. Only a film with a tenacious grasp of absurdity would allow such talk and ""The Lobster"" the first English-language feature by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos fits the bill. Tranquil in manner yet brisk in momentum it lays out the foreground of the story without pausing to fill in the backdrop; clue by clue we have to work it out for ourselves. The underlying tenet of society we come to understand is that people are forbidden to be single. Parts of the film are set in a city where we see that principle in action. A woman on her own in a mall is stopped by security guards who demand politely but firmly to know the whereabouts of her husband; she explains that he is away on a business trip. Another solo shopper is asked to produce his ""certificate"" in order to prove that he has a spouse. David is a wretched case. (The casting of Farrell who played Alexander the Great for Oliver Stone is a subtle joke in itself.) His wife has recently left him and so he is sent to the hotel; no one must be alone for long. With him he takes a Border collie--a loyal pal and no wonder for it is in fact his brother who presumably tried and failed to find a partner of his own. (Most such failures according to the manager elect to become dogs. ""That is why the world is full of dogs"" she says.) One pleasure of ""The Lobster"" all the more striking for going unremarked is the array of passing creatures a flamingo stalks by providing a splash of pink amid the earth tones of the landscape; and an Irish guest with long blond hair appears outside the hotel after an unsuccessful stay as a Shetland pony. So strong is the conceit behind ""The Lobster"" that only gradually do you realize how much plot is being packed in. Things begin to stir as David and the other residents armed with tranquillizer guns are forced to go hunting. The prey is not beasts but loners single folk who have gone rogue in the woods and need to be culled. (The chase is shot in slow motion to extraordinary effect.) Loners willingly follow their own code of conduct which is every bit as severe as that which prevails at the hotel. They may fraternize or dance without touching but that is all two of them wear surgical dressings on their lips having been caught in an embrace and punished with something called ""the red kiss."" David now absconds to join the loners and falls in love with one of them (Rachel Weisz). The irony could not be more acrid our hero unable to lose his heart at the hotel then loses it in the one place where the loss is considered a crime. Only in the city where David and the woman evade suspicion by pretending to be a couple do we see them share a writhing smooch and even then they are told not to overdo it. Wherever you go Lanthimos implies the laws entrap you. That is a serious charge and for all the pranks that he plays on our assumptions Lanthimos is full of grave intent. No art for a filmmaker as for a novelist is finer or harder than that of keeping a straight face as you hold the world up to scorn. Swift managed it and so did Bunuel but few current directors apart from Lanthimos and Todd Solondz make the effort. What is more theres nothing paltry or cheap about the targets that Lanthimos picks. ""Dogtooth"" (2009) his breakout movie sought to dismantle the family unit; ""Alps"" (2011) took on death no less and the culture of grief with characters being hired to impersonate the deceased for the sake of the mourners; and now we have ""The Lobster"" which snaps at love. You could easily claim that the film confines its ridicule to the Tinderized--to those who are offered such elaborate assistance in the speed and the precision of their wooing that they are left with no excuse for being alone. The script by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou certainly sports with the notion of the perfect match. At the hotel everyone owns up to a defining flaw. Robert (John C. Reilly) has a lisp for example and John (Ben Whishaw) has a limp. So desperate is John to stay human that having met a woman who gets nosebleeds he keeps banging his own schnozzle to draw blood and thus to dupe her into accepting him as her equal. As for David he is moved to discover that the woman in the woods like him is nearsighted. Why should they not peer into the future together? All this is neatly done and Whishaw in particular is frighteningly dry yet ""The Lobster"" is more than a satire on the dating game. It digs deeper needling at the status of our most tender emotions. Even when David and his fellow-myopic are revealed to be kindred spirits that kinship affords them little joy. Not once do they seem happy and I fear that Lanthimos regards romantic bliss like domestic harmony as yet another illusion to be pricked. Hence the stern voice-over supplied by Weisz sounding like a school principal. Hence too the soundtrack--mostly jagged snatches of string music by Beethoven Shostakovich Schnittke and others scraping away any patches of contentment. One image of four loners walking down a country road clad in suits recalls the similar strollers who crop up in Bunuels ""Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" (1972) yet Lanthimos lacks the masters blithe awareness that in the matter of tone the savage can cohabit with the suave. Although few films this year will make the kind of impression that ""The Lobster"" does it remains grim fare spiky and unconsoling and where there are laughs they die at the back of the throat. To anyone planning to see this movie on a date good luck. How do you define the Avengers? Two phrases from ""Captain America Civil War"" offer alternative answers. One is ""a lot of superpeople."" The other is ""a group of U.S.-based enhanced individuals"" which for one heavenly moment suggests that since we last met Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and his merry mates they have put on weight. Imagine a wobbly Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a lumbering Falcon (Anthony Mackie) with Captain America (Chris Evans) the incredible chunk bringing up the rear. Alas the whole gang is in good shape although they are having issues with their bonding. The big news delivered by the Secretary of State (William Hurt) is that Avenging hitherto a privately run concern will now be controlled by the U.N. under the ""Sokovia Accords"" named for the location of a previous adventure. (Why do made-up countries always sound like somewhere ruled by Groucho Marx?) Iron Man likes the idea whereas Captain America hates it. You could parse their clash as a grownup debate on the politics of governance but its really not. Its an excuse for the two of them to duke it out on a German airfield each with a bunch of friends at his behest. Even Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) get roped in with mixed results. Both are nicely played and they leaven the mood (a tiny Rudd gets to hop inside Downeys metal costume like a flea) yet their very presence smacks of desperation. The motto of the directors Anthony and Joe Russo appears to be If you can make it happen do it. Dont hold back. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes had a word for this method ""exorbitancy."" Three hundred and sixty-six years ago in an uncanny trailer for Marvel he wrote ""There are some that are not pleased with fiction unless it be bold not onely to exceed the work but also the possibility of nature they would have impenetrable Armors Inchanted Castles invulnerable bodies Iron Men flying Horses and a thousand other such things which are easily feigned by them that dare."" As the feigning wears off and ""Captain America Civil War"" crawls to a close you sense that the possibilities of nature have been not just exceeded but exhausted. Even the dialogue seems like a special effect ""Youre being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal"" Black Widow remarks to Iron Man. Translation ""Say something.""

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr May 6 2016 Culture Way back in 2012 I was genuinely astonished by the cinematic juggling act that Joss Whedon accomplished in The Avengers. Six heroes pulled from widely different walks of super-life Who could believe hed manage to integrate them all into a coherent story?These days that challenge looks rudimentary. A year ago Whedons The Avengers Age of Ultron found space to squeeze in three more heroes and a brand-new super-villain along with another half-dozen characters from the ever-expanding Marvel universe. And now in Captain America Civil War--which serves in many respects as a third Avengers movie--we have fully a dozen heroes divvied up into two competing super-teams. At this rate pretty soon Marvel Studios honcho Kevin Feige will have to rent out a stadium just to accommodate his lycra-clad swarms. Related Story A Somber Super Captain America The Winter Soldier Directed by the brothers Joe and Anthony Russo Civil War is technically a follow-up to their superlative Captain America Winter Soldier from 2014. But given the ongoing interweavings of the Marvel Cinematic Universe--this movie also integrates last years Ant-Man and serves as a setup for future films with Black Panther and a newly introduced Spider-Man (thank you Sony)--such details are becoming incidental. In any case here as in Winter Soldier the Russos have achieved an uncommon balance of plot and action humor and drama all of it once again deeply grounded in character.The movie opens in 1991 with a frozen Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) being thawed out for another in a series of murderous missions. (Marvel fans will recall that he is Bucky Barnes Captain Americas wartime--that is to say WW II-time--best friend who was long ago given a bionic arm and brainwashed into becoming an assassin for the international conspiracy Hydra.) One after another the code words needed to activate the killer are spoken ""daybreak ... furnace ... homecoming ... freight car ...""Flash forward to present-day Lagos where an Avengers squad made up of Captain America (Chris Evans) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) is foiling the theft of a biological weapon. (Blink for a moment and youll miss a brief appearance by Brock Rumlow a.k.a. Crossbones as the head thief.) Civilians are injured in the process however which leads to the requisite handwringing back at Avengers HQ. ""People died"" explains Cap. ""Its on me.""The litany of accumulating havoc is quickly itemized New York (The Avengers) Washington D.C. (Winter Soldier) the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia (Age of Ultron) and now Lagos--everywhere the Avengers seek to do good they wind up leaving a trail of destruction. Given this record the U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt and yes he does appear to be this Thaddeus Ross) proposes that the Avengers submit to United Nations oversight.Cap immediately balks at the idea having learned firsthand in Winter Soldier that taking orders from a global security entity can turn out rather badly. But somewhat more surprisingly Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man a.k.a. Robert Downey Jr.) thinks that this submission to a higher authority is a good idea. So does his pal James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (a.k.a. War Machine a.k.a. Don Cheadle)--though his comment ""This is the United Nations were talking about"" suggests hes not terribly familiar with the organizations overall record of efficacy. (Do you really want Vladimir Putin to have veto authority over the Avengers?)And so the lines are drawn Stark Rhodey Black Widow and the Vision (Paul Bettany) on the side of UN oversight; and Cap Falcon and Scarlet Witch against. The former group will eventually add a Wakandan prince in Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and a Queens teenager in Spider-Man (Tom Holland); the latter group will bring in Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Caps pal Bucky--by now wanted by law enforcement for a new act of Winter Soldier terrorism--and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Need a scorecard yet? If not you surely will by the time the movie introduces additional characters played by Daniel Bruhl Alfre Woodard Martin Freeman Hope Davis and Marisa Tomei (who may be the least spinster-y version of Peter Parkers Aunt May ever committed to screen).This being Marvel--as opposed to ahem DC--the movie is sprinkled with liberal doses of humor.The ensuing plot--which Im not fool enough to even attempt to summarize-- hopscotches the globe with the mileage-accruing abandon of a Bond flick Cleveland London Vienna Bucharest Berlin each locale announced with towering onscreen type. The heroes duel among themselves now and again notably in a bravura chase scene with Cap in pursuit of Black Panther who is himself in pursuit of Bucky.These skirmishes culminate in a titanic six-on-six battle royale between the vying super-squads. The sequence is a stunner choreographed with wit and verve and featuring the notable introduction of a super-power we had not witnessed before (though one that Marvel aficionados may guess). Key to the scene is that every participant has individual abilities and personality For once there are no expendably faceless masses of Chitauri or Ultron-bots or evil S.H.I.E.L.D. agents cluttering things up.Better still is the fact that the Russos (working from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who also wrote Winter Soldier) stage this mega-battle well before the movies conclusion thus shrewdly allowing themselves a more intimate finale. If there has been a flaw to date in the Marvel films--and superhero movies more broadly--its been the need for a Big Finish an alien invasion dueling helicarriers a city launched into the sky.Instead the Russos bring things back down to a more personal scale primarily featuring Cap Bucky and Iron Man. (Its worth noting here that as brilliant a gamble as Downey Jr. has long shown himself as the flamboyant Tony Stark Evans has proven equally crucial for Marvel as the moral-universe-centering Cap.) The pictures non-Armageddon ending is an especially nice touch given that the initial plot was premised on misgivings about the collateral damage typically associated with super-squabbles.This being Marvel--as opposed to ahem DC--the movie is sprinkled with liberal doses of humor the cyborg Vision attempting without much success to cook his first paprikash (""In my defense Ive never actually eaten anything before""); a nice callback (""I can do this all day"") to the first Captain America movie; a sly Tony Stark reference to The Manchurian Candidate; a likable moment of outer-borough bonding by fellow New Yorkers Cap and Spidey.Yet for all the action and wit on display there are mournful undercurrents to Civil War much as there were to Winter Soldier before it. While the Russos prior outing very consciously referenced the paranoid espionage cinema of the 1970s--Three Days of the Condor The Parallax View Marathon Man etc.--Civil War reaches back further still with echoes of noir throughout of long-held secrets and past sins that cannot be undone. The result is a movie that while perhaps not quite reaching the Marvel high points of The Avengers and Winter Soldier nonetheless belongs in their immediate company. Are there a few too many ingredients crammed into the recipe? No question. But unlike the Visions paprikash the completed dish is nonetheless delicious.Related Video ""I took it on for the same reason I take on new stories--to grow intellectually and artistically.""

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Captain America Civil War our 13th spin around the Marvel Cinematic Universe is such a satisfying Problems In 21st Century Superheroics seminar that Id be humming its theme for days if only I could remember it. Does Captain America have a theme? Does Iron Man? What about Black Widow? Havent they each earned one by now? Eight years into a lovingly micromanaged franchise that has made Marvel Studios as indomitable as Galactus benevolent mogul Kevin Feige still hasnt found a composer to elevate one of these movies to the firmament of earworms. Civil Wars ersatz score by Henry ""Not Wolverine"" Jackman mightve been borrowed from a 90s Tom Clancy flick. The movie isnt all that much to look at either. Much of it takes place indoors and its exteriors all appear to have been captured on the same cloudy afternoon in the spring of 2015 (though theres a Mark Fuhrman joke that American Crime Story has made topical again). Sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo were best known for the hip TV comedies Arrested Development and Community before Marvel hired them to make the superb Captain America The Winter Soldier; theyre doing the next two Avengers too. Their current Avengers movie the one called Captain America Civil War has aerial combat and even a shot-in-IMAX sequence but its visual sense remains stubbornly small screen. (I saw it in 3-D which made the fight choreography -- so crisp in Winter Soldier -- look sloppier and the green-screen shots look faker. 2-D is A-1.) At least itll hold up well on the at-home revisits its bound to enjoy as Marvels sinister-sounding Phase Three marches on. Because in all the ways that matter most -- characterization performance emotional tension allegorical heft -- Civil War is Earths Mightiest Marvel movie. It is also at 147 minutes the longest but every minute is up there on the screen so to speak. Its both more tense and more operatic than Joss Whedons seminal Avengers chapters and it juggles even more characters successfully. Best of all it achieves genuine pathos while still being enormously funny. Its the Vibranium standard for superteam flicks. Liberally adapted from a Mark Millar comic book scenario circa 2006-7 Civil War finds the Avengers disassembled The cumulative human cost of their adventures plus a botched mission in this movie resulting in still more loss of life has the world demanding the team submit to United Nations oversight. Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark the hero most traumatized by their battles thinks its the right move. (As the person most responsible for creating Ultron the malignant AI that talks like James Spader he has good reason to believe that their power is too dangerous to remain unchecked.) But Captain Steve Rogers -- still the lionhearted Brooklyn kid who tried again to enlist against the Nazis each time the draft board ruled him 4-F -- believes the world will be safer if its guardians remain autonomous. And because screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and star Chris Evans have developed the character so beautifully over the past five years our hearts are with Cap even though Starks position is clearly the rational one. Things get more dire when Bucky ""The Winter Soldier"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) -- who like his pre-brainwashing best pal Steve has stayed in his early 30s since the early 40s thanks to evil Nazi cryoscience -- becomes a suspect in an assassination that puts the enigmatic new hero Black Panther on his trail. Cap is maniacally determined to protect his oldest friend even when he appears to be guilty. This pattern of characters we know to be good making honest and consequential mistakes is what makes Civil War resonate like a classical tragedy. Well that and Robert Downey Jr. who in his sixth appearance as Stark appears more invested in the part than ever. Hes not the glib egotist of films past; his worldview has darkened. And yet his scouting trip to Queens to recruit a certain friendly neighborhood do-gooder who lives with his aunt proves that even in brooding mode Downey can still knock a comedic scene out of the park. He gets a big assist from believably adolescent new wall-crawler Tom Holland who makes the occasion of Spidey finally being granted full MCU citizenship feel like the blessed event that it is. Perhaps sensing that some quarters of the audience may be getting fidgety after all this chitchat the partners of McFeely Markus Russo amp; Russo reward our patience with the grandest most inventive supersmackdown in cape-flick history. Its six on six; Iron Man isnt the only one who thought to bring backup. The filmmakers have approached the problem of how warriors with these particular talents might attack and counter one another with the zealous imagination of 9-year-olds. But theyve also considered that each side is trying to subdue its rivals without causing irreversible harm. That would-that-it-twere-so-simple objective plus the humor that inexperienced combatants Spider-Man and Ant-Man bring to the fray makes for an ingenious set piece that keeps finding new ways to surprise us. After that bravura sequence the film wisely goes for intimacy rather than trying to top itself on spectacle. There are revelations large and small and some plotting thats just as wobbly as Batman v Supermans if were being honest. That kind of thing is almost inevitable in a story with this many moving parts and is easily forgiven in a picture -- a franchise -- thats done the hard work of making us care. Thats not to say it isnt hard to look at all those perfectly sculpted visages Anthony Mackie as Caps best 21st century pal Falcon. Daniel Bruhl playing a mysterious conspirator. Someone named Scarlett Johansson. (I had to look her up.) Chadwick Boseman whose regal Black Panther makes you wish his Ryan Coogler-helmed movie was arriving sooner than 2018. Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch still learning to control her hex-projecting (really) powers. Paul Bettany as Vision the Infinity Stone-encrusted android (stay with me) who is struggling with his feelings for a teammate. And Evans who is struggling with his feelings for a S.H.I.E.L.D. colleague with a connection to his (distant) past. So much struggling. So many feelings. So many faces. Stare at any one of them too long and your retinas will burn out. Even Martin Freeman -- Bilbo Baggins for crying out loud -- gets a Slatteryesque silver-fox coif in this movie as if a cameo by the real John Slattery werent enough. And William Hurt playing the official face of the U.N. oversight plan looks hale enough to start filming Body Heat 2 Ragnarok tomorrow. If Feige lets the Russos make it Im there.

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Now playing at GTA theatres. 148 minutes. PGCaptain America Civil War puts fun back into superhero feuding. It remembers we go to movies not to see good guys kill each other but to see them work out their differences so they can stop bad guys.Article Continued BelowLets forget the joyless Batman v Superman which stinted on sarcasm a comic-book staple. Its title stars became vengeful psychotic thugs.Civil War reminds us its OK to enjoy a few laughs even while diabolical villains plot doom outraged citizens demand accountability and your best pal mistrusts you. One agreeably silly scene has super dudes piling into a Volkswagen and arguing about leg room.All this conflicted engagement makes for quite the spectacle as the clock ticks toward the 2.5-hour mark.Winter Soldier co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo are back with Cap again played by Chris Evans with chiseled authority. His brainwashed BFF Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is still causing misguided mayhem.The Russos know what theyre doing -- theyre great at scenes of flying bodies and machinery -- but theyre really directing another Avengers saga.Most of that costumed mob and their pals are here Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Falcon (Anthony Mackie) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) War Machine (Don Cheadle) Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) all take sides in the title bout.Thor and The Hulk are MIA but the Russos and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely rustle up yet more members of the Marvel Comics Universe to expand franchises Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) the latter two actors new to the MCU.The feuding is about owning your actions a popular blockbuster theme of late. The United Nations is fed up with squabbling heroes and villains destroying buildings and killing bystanders as an Avengers cock-up in Nigeria demonstrates early on.The U.S. Secretary of State (William Hurt) insists the Avengers submit to UN oversight a shackling Iron Man agrees to (""We need to be put in check"") but Captain America resists (""The safest hands are still our own"").Youd normally get opposite opinions from these two. Discerning motivations and alliances passes the time between battles especially since the films chief villain played by Daniel Bruhl is more of a wearisome super brat like Jesse Eisenbergs Lex Luthor in Batman v Superman.

"Captain America Civil War reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Captain America Civil War Is Marvel at Its Best Captain America Civil War Is Marvel at Its Best Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 5 2016 726 PM Captain America Civil War One of Marvels best films is a human-sized affair. By Jamelle Bouie Robert Downey Jr. in Captain America Civil War. Marvel Studios In its comic-book form Marvels Civil War was a mess in ways that the new movie deftly avoids. The seven-issue limited series written by Mark Millar and released in 2006 aimed to situate superheroes in the world of practical politics. A team of young superheroes ambushes a group of villains in Stamford Connecticut for their reality show an act that leads to a violent fight and explosion that kills 600 people children among them. The public turns against superheroes and Congress passes a registration act. As Daredevil says to a group of heroes debating the law ""[T]his has been building up for a long time. Stamfords just the straw that broke the camels back."" Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slates chief political correspondent. Under more capable hands this could have set the stage for a genuine debate over the ethics of superheroism. Should masked crusaders with incredible powers operate with full autonomy? Are they accountable to the public? What obligations do they hold to the damage they cause and the innocent lives they harm? Advertisement Instead readers were treated to a clumsy metaphor for the war on terror where Tony Starks Iron Man joins the governments registration push and arrests heroes who dont comply (sending them to a superhero Guantanamo in the Negative Zone) and Steve Rogers Captain America is a civil libertarian leading a noble resistance. Any nuance in the conflict was squashed in favor of a plain-vanilla morality play that misread the core qualities of its central characters. (Somehow the actual New Dealer in the story Rogers is the enemy of the government while tech-triumphalist Stark is its stooge.) But that was a decade ago. Before Iron Man before the Marvel Cinematic Universe before The Avengers. Now Civil War is back--as Captain America Civil War--and while it owes key themes to its printed predecessor its a different beast entirely. In the film there is no registration act--just the ""Vienna Accords"" drafted by the United Nations and meant to turn the Avengers into a strike force sanctioned by the U.N. Under the accords our heroes intervene only when they have permission and stay on the leash when they dont. Civil War alludes to the politics of superheroism but this isnt a political film. Advertisement The catalyst isnt an incident as much as its a collection of incidents. The chaos of earlier films in the series--the destruction of Manhattan in The Avengers of the fictional Sokovia in Age of Ultron of Washington D.C. in The Winter Soldier--as well as collateral damage in Civil Wars opening prompt a move to bring the Avengers under some kind of control. Tony Stark anxious and grief-stricken after coming face-to-face with the human damage of his superheroism signs the accords bringing half the Avenger team with him. Steve Rogers distrustful of authority and secure in his judgment refuses. The two disagree but dont come to blows. Things change when authorities go after the Winter Soldier--aka Bucky Barnes Captain Americas best friend--and a wall falls between Stark and Rogers as former allies become rivals. This is the titular ""civil war"" and it brings in a host of other superheroes from familiar faces like War Machine Falcon Black Widow the Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man to two new characters Chadwick Bosemans dutiful imposing and magnetic Black Panther and Tom Hollands nervous excitable adolescent Peter Parker who are highlights of the film. (Civil War might be the first modern superhero movie with three black leads Boseman Don Cheadle as War Machine and Anthony Mackie as Falcon.) The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America drives a wedge through this community of heroes. And they fight in one of the most joyous cinematic superhero battles ever filmed the closest thing weve seen to an on-screen splash page. Advertisement Whats important however is that this isnt the conclusion. Theres still more conflict more pain and more hurt to go between Captain America Iron Man and Bucky. Which gets to what distinguishes Civil War the film from Civil War the comic and what makes it a unique entry in the Marvel canon overall. Civil War alludes to the politics of superheroism but this isnt a political film. There are tent-pole battles and huge spectacles--the chase between Captain America Bucky and Black Panther is an incredible example of deft cinema and showing character through action--but in the end this is a movie about friendships and conflict and what can happen when the latter overwhelms the former. Its about two genuine heroes who cant reconcile their obligations and duties with the friendship they both cherish. Top Comment SPOILER ALERT Lee surrenders and Lincoln is assassinated.  More... Join In Its impossible not to compare Civil War to Warner Bros. Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice. They tackle similar themes--of collateral damage and the role of superheroes legitimacy--and they both bring a smorgasbord of characters and mythology to the table. But where Civil War is colorful and fun Batman v. Superman is dour and dark. Where Civil War showcases the able filmmaking of the Russo brothers Batman v. Superman reminds us that Zack Snyder is a stylist who cant tell a story. And most importantly where Civil War is rooted in character and emotion Batman v. Superman is an excuse for spectacle. The heroes fight because thats the movie theyre in not because it makes sense. Theyre not characters as much as theyre pieces on a 250 million board. Thats where the contrast with Civil War lies and why Civil War is one of the best films to come out of Marvel Studios. Despite the huge ensemble cast and the expensive special effects Captain America Civil War is a human-sized affair. Yes theres a villain--Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo--but hes almost beside the point. Yes theres a final battle but it isnt the cataclysm of previous Marvel entries. Its just two friends tired and angry whose mutual hurt and betrayal have brought them to blows.

Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is a funny highlight and Robert Downey Jr.s acting is especially impressive. By Peter Rainer Film critic May 5 2016 Save for later Saved Captain America Civil War stars Elizabeth Olsen (l.) Chris Evans (center) and Sebastian Stan (r.). Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Superhero movies How well do you know them? Monitor Movie Guide With so many superheroes to choose from ""Captain America Civil War"" is a veritable Marvel smorgasbord. Most of it goes down easy although the film is too much of what is at best a pretty good thing. The advantage of having all these Marvel characters in the same movie is that if one subplot is not working another possibly better one is sure to follow.The story line centers on who should have control of the superpowered - themselves or the governments of the world. At odds are Captain America (Chris Evans) who bristles at any world oversight and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who begs to differ. Choosing up sides is everybody from Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow to Paul Rudds Ant-Man. Even Spider-Man looking distinctly boyish as played by Tom Holland gets into the act. The films funniest moments come when Spidey ever the fanboy must square off against a few of his icons.The action directed by Joe and Anthony Russo is thuddingly effective without being terribly imaginative but at least its not in the clobber-the-audience ""Transformers"" category. Downey Jr. persists in trying to give a real performance in these Marvel movies and against all odds succeeds. I wish he would try to act more in movies that dont require him to stand in front of a special-effects screen and wear a plastic suit.

Film review Captain America Civil War is dependable enjoyable Comment By Katie Walsh Tribune News Service The Bulletin By Katie Walsh Tribune News Service Posted May. 5 2016 at 104 PM Updated May 5 2016 at 104 PM By Katie Walsh Tribune News Service Posted May. 5 2016 at 104 PM >>  RELATED CONTENT  Summer movies Your guide to the season of reboots mutants sequels and the supernatura... Every summer a Marvel superhero film sweeps into theaters like a breath of fresh air a standard-bearer.This May thats ""Captain America Civil War"" directed by Joe and Anthony Russo.Theres political commentary emotional stakes and plenty of action but with a lighthearted quality zingers and jokes littered throughout to brighten up the atmosphere.Theres a hopefulness that maybe some ""enhanced individuals"" do the right thing because they still believe in that.Thats not the only way to do a superhero comic book movie but its dependable reliable comforting -- like ordering at a chain restaurant. You know what kind of meal youre going to get every time and youll most likely enjoy it.""Civil War"" centers around the ramifications of the events from ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" wherein the fictional nation of Sokovia was leveled as well as a mishap in Lagos during an Avengers mission early in the film which results in the loss of many lives.Its almost as if there needs to be some regulation on a band of superheroes romping about the globe intervening in international affairs willy nilly.Thats what Secretary of State Ross (William Hurt) believes and Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is inclined to agree with him taking a more liberal pro-government stance.Not quite in agreement is Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) the libertarian type who is resistant to government intervention and remains staunch in his beliefs that he knows whats right and wrong.His stance is exacerbated when his old buddy Bucky/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is framed for a bombing during a U.N. meeting to ratify the Sokovia accords.The film is refreshingly open to debate on this topic. Rather than pushing an oppressive or undisputed ideology theres discussion about the nuances of the right way to do the right thing that maybe there are many different ways to be right -- you can follow the rules or follow your beliefs.The action here is refreshingly human-scaled rather than the skyscraper-obliterating disasters of other films.Were introduced to TChalla Wakanda/Black Panther (Chadwick Bozeman) and his muscly feline prowess is a welcome addition to the team. As is the chipper teen enthusiasm of Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tom Holland).Though much of it can seem like crashing action figures together the match-ups between the heroes of different powers are thrilling and executed with humor and smarts.However as the film crosses the two-hour mark the endless punching becomes relentlessly dull.Marvels marketing campaign has exhorted fans to choose TeamCap or TeamIronMan. Within the movie this question becomes a debate between science and emotion protocol and friendship. Neither is the wrong way necessarily.The Avengers have always been powered by their shared collective power so the friendship theme is important but hammered home again and again in Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeelys screenplay.Page 2 of 2 - This is a Captain America movie so the choice would seem clear -- why then does the TeamIronMan choice seem more sensible?Americas brawny sweetheart puts on the nice guy airs but hes loathe to see outside of his perspective change his ways or compromise. His old-fashioned Greatest Generation schtick isnt quite as charming (or effective) this time around. As an Avengers movie ""Civil War"" is a cut above the rest but unfortunately our relationship to the titular hero is tarnished in the process.""Captain America"" Civil War"" is rated PG 13. Running time 2 hours 26 minutes.

After ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" sought to lay the groundwork for ""Justice League"" Marvels ""Captain America Civil War"" assembles a dizzying dozen costume-clad heroes. Marvel has made this notion of a ""cinematic universe"" where multiple heroes co-exist a foundation of its strategy migrating the idea from comics to movies and TV. ""Civil War"" which is both thematically ambitious and extremely entertaining feels like a culmination of those efforts. While lacking the label its basically a third ""Avengers"" film and creatively the best of the bunch. Directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo -- responsible for the well-regarded ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" and the next ""Avengers"" -- the movie tackles a serious theme. Specifically Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) wind up on opposite sides of a political debate involving tradeoffs to liberty in pursuit of security. In this case thats about controlling these ""enhanced"" beings with the U.S. government negotiating a global pact seeking to govern when and where they can take action. To Captain America and those who rally around him the precedent is dangerous. To Iron Man its simply pragmatic given the collateral damage their heroics can inflict and already have. Related Spider-Man doing what he can to boost box office for Captain America Civil War Well paced despite its near-2 1/2-hour length the movie features several elaborate fast-paced sequences building toward a showdown pitting the two groups of heroes against each other. Think of it as a basketball game only with an abundance of high-flying and egregiously flagrant fouls. Amid all that however its amazing how much business in the literal sense ""Civil War"" manages to conduct. That includes introducing the Black Panther (""42s"" Chadwick Boseman) even if hes never identified as such; and the latest reboot of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) due for his own separate adventure. (Notably the latters movie will be distributed by Sony not Marvel parent Disney although Marvel has taken over creative stewardship of the franchise.) Granted this shouldnt come as a complete surprise since these movies are designed to do more than tell an individual story; they are also tasked with whetting appetites for spin-offs and sequels. ""Batman v Superman"" not only brought in Wonder Woman before her featured vehicle but dropped in glimpses (commercials really) for the Flash and Aquaman. Whats especially admirable about ""Civil War"" is that it manages to weave in those elements without losing its focus -- and more significantly its sense of fun. Even during the central fight there are playful moments such as Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) initially behaving like a tongue-tied fan or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) hoping they can still be friends when its all over. Related Captain America Civil War nabs 200 million at overseas box office in days For some the movie will doubtless feel too caught up in the larger Marvel universe as it careens from story to story. A few flourishes as always appear intended strictly to evoke gasps or chuckles from the handful of really committed fans that will get them. The ending is also a trifle messy and rushed and the villain (naturally there has to be one) isnt particularly inspired. Still after a stretch where superhero movies have produced headache-inducing sequences with almost abusive computer-generated imagery ""Civil War"" maintains a sense of humanity. The fights are fast frenetic and crowd-pleasing but mostly avoid the trap of becoming hollow animated constructs. In that the Russo brothers seldom lose sight of the fact it should feel like there are people underneath those masks and armor. Nor should the movies sheer scope be taken for granted. This marks a significant departure from the genres past even as recently as a few years ago. In those days lone crusaders would usually be introduced -- complete with origin story -- and battle a single threat. Superheroes were James Bond just with a more garish wardrobe. Related Marvels The Punisher to star in spinoff Whats changed? Special effects have obviously made the spectacle of multiple characters feasible. Growing international box office has also emboldened studios by increasing the likelihood that theyll see a return on these massive investments of 200 million or more on production. While the idea of a DC-Marvel rivalry has been overstated -- as in the comics theres room for both -- the former hurried the process in ""Batman v Superman"" while Marvel assiduously built up to it. The result is a film that honors its comic-book origins while feeling like a massive spectacle. Moreover ""Civil War"" touches on darker thematic elements without becoming grim or weighted down by the density of its mythology. Simply put when it comes to juggling multiple superheroes in a single movie Marvels latest comes close to setting the standard. And the studio as well as the villagers should have cause to rejoice.

Sure members of the Avengers saved the world a few times over but innocents died in the process and so someones got to take the blame. Or at least accept a government collar. Human computer The Vision must have fried a circuit explaining it thus ""strength invites challenge; challenge creates conflict; conflict breeds catastrophe."" Never mind that the Avengers were gathered in response to a threat not vise versa. The red-blooded patriot Captain America holds to principle but former arms dealer Iron Mans bad conscience gets the better of him and the conflict is as they say created. (Just try not to giggle at the notion of the US Government gravely fretting over collateral damage.) Moving on to the tension-free spectacle of heroes punching heroes -- lots of flying bodies minimal damage done -- that serves as both dramatic centerpiece and climax. And finishing with the final reveal of the evil masterminds absurdly convoluted plot. The jokey super-banter remains to provide comic relief and there are one or two moments that really stick (Cap vs. a helicopter Iron Man vs. his own rage and hey look Spider-Man). But mostly this one registers as sound and fury signifying sequels. Directed by the Russo brothers Joe and Anthony. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona Related links ""Hate-watching Marvel movies in favor of reading comic books""  May 25 2016 This movie is not currently in theaters. Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Comments John B May 9 2016  859 a.m. The theme behind this movie is based on a very popular story arc within the core Marvel Universe that had major crossover effects and lasting impacts with each of its main characters. The writers/directors had a daunting task ahead of them to apply the same type of effect of Civil War within the existing Marvel Cinematic Universe. Granted this means that one has various other movies (Iron Man 1-3 The Avengers 1 and 2 and Captain America 1 and 2 to name a few) they would benefit from watching in order to fully appreciate the sequel and accomplishment that is Captain America Civil War. This achievement in film is unprecedented and the only other collaboration of this magnitude has been seen in The Avengers films. Hate it or Love it this is definitely a comic-book movie in every sense of the word and has committed no perjury of the genre. 1 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Dragonfly May 23 2016  1014 p.m. Matthew please assure me that ""vise versa"" is some play on words and not simply atrocious spelling. 1 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Sign in to comment Username I have an account.

Its a question with contemporary resonance in a comic book extravaganza thats enhanced by wit and audacity not to mention the sort of action that only mountains of money can buy.

Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity). ""Captain America Civil War"" is really the third ""Avengers"" movie and its the ""We Are the World"" of the multiplex. There are many beloved figures. We want them to be great. But ""star quantity"" is not a thing. Gushing with hundreds of second-string superheroes ""Civil War"" ought to delight Comic-Con goers bless their virgin hearts. Its better than the jokey tiresome ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" or ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" But after the first two ""Captain America"" entries the finest comic-book movies of the last five years this one is disappointing. The story doesnt make sense After two crashing but routine action scenes in Vienna and Nigeria result in civilian casualties the world demands the Avengers be regulated -- and the US secretary of state (William Hurt) not only agrees but threatens to lock up the Avengers if they dont comply. Americas top diplomat wants to neutralize our advantages? So far so John Kerry -- and the Avengers get lectured on their lack of democratic accountability . . . by a king. But heres whats ridiculous Notoriously arrogant individualistic and brilliant Tony Stark a k a Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) readily agrees to bureaucratic oversight. Huh? A handful of innocents were killed in Africa because the Avengers were saving millions from a deadly virus (this is the same plot as ""Batman v Superman"" indicating our highest-paid screenwriters have now had their imaginations captured by the administrative state). So all superhero greenlighting duties should be turned over to a UN committee? So Cuba and Uzbekistan can filibuster when a nuclear-irradiated praying mantis the size of Philadelphia is chomping the top off the Empire State Building? Time would be of the essence when the world is under alien attack so why is Stark suddenly as dumb as a box of Thors hammers? Tom Holland plays Spider-Man in ""Captain America Civil War.""Photo Film Frame (c) Marvel 2016 Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is on Team Iron Man while Captain America (Chris Evans) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) have misgivings which leads up to the only first-rate scene in the movie a 15-minute blowout at an airport in which a dozen superheroes cheerfully slug it out in part on behalf of the Winter Soldier Captain Americas best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) who is alternately good and evil depending on the whim of the moment. An amusing cameo from the new Spider-Man now played by Tom Holland helps give the scene its sparkle. That fight -- cute though it is and balancing humor with action as last years ""Ant-Man"" (a much better film) did so well -- suffers from a lack of stakes. It amounts to a touch-football game in which no one is really trying to hurt anyone. A later skirmish is fierce but so weakly motivated that a letter of apology is all thats needed for all to be forgotten. Christopher Nolans ""Dark Knight"" movies were long because they had a lot of story to tell but this one is long because it wastes time on the JV squad Does anyone care about Elizabeth Olsens witchy-poo act or that silly Sterno snowball shes always juggling? Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is as dull as kitty litter and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is a glorified water boy. Nor do we need two Iron Men so Don Cheadles War Machine needs to go as does Paul Bettanys Vision who isnt funny enough to be comic relief. They are to saving the world what Al Jarreau and Daryl Hall are to music.

Comments click to enlarge Captain America Civil War Video Rated PG-13  146 minutes  2016 Despite all the levitating superheroes this third installment in Marvels Captain America franchise almost sinks under the weight of its own gravitas especially during the largely expository first hour. After unintentionally killing innocents during a mission in Africa the Avengers must vote on whether to accept oversight by a United Nations panel; Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) leads the supporters and the naysayers line up behind Captain America (Chris Evans). The players salvage this thing with their acting and awesome thighs and the fun really kicks in when Spider-Man (Tom Holland) Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) join the squabble in an exhilarating airport sequence. After that centerpiece the slugfest grows monotonous on its way to a final showdown. Brothers Joe and Anthony Russo directed.

Problem is they dont really want to -- and its not at all clear that growing up is good for business. Comic books and comic-book movies are a consummately American narrative form. Americanism meaning a worldview or state of mind that permeates much of the human population far beyond the borders of the United States is built on the proposition that you never have to grow up. History is bunk; power is virtue; the sovereign individual reigns supreme; all forms of collective governance are for sissies. These are the premises of the comic-book universe and of fascism. They are also the fantasies of children.Is it unfair to suggest that the juvenile American fantasy universe that produces something like ""Captain America Civil War"" the latest preordained worldwide hit from the Marvel Comics pantheon is closely related to the juvenile American fantasy universe that produces Donald Trump Republican nominee for president? Maybe a little but not that much. Im not completely ignorant of actual comics O enraged commenters of the near future I was an actual American boy once who purchased copies of ""Doctor Strange"" off a dusty beaver-board rack at McHaffies Drugs. I think they cost 45 cents. Im aware that Marvel Comics have long had a left-libertarian streak while the DC universe could more plausibly be accused of harboring proto-fascist archetypes.Donald Trump superficially resembles a Marvel villain more than a Marvel hero but thats missing the point. Trump is nowhere near as witty or urbane as Tony Stark aka Iron Man the billionaire superhero played by Robert Downey Jr. who is in many ways (despite the films title) the central character of ""Captain America Civil War."" (If you are remotely likely to complain about whatever spoilers I may let fall about this movie inadvertently and because I totally dont care then this article isnt for you and you can stop reading it now. We counted the click already.)Stark wears stylish Tom Ford suits when not clad in an impregnable computerized tin can whereas Trump is like the worst-dressed rich man ever. Im sure his suits are expensive and all but the Trumpian wardrobe displays no vestige of personality; he still looks like a guy whos trying to sell you a 1000 vacuum cleaner or a nonexistent condo in Cancun. Tony Stark is almost ostentatiously OK with having black friends at a level that supposedly goes beyond ""Here are my black friends"" to ""I dont even think about that"" whereas Trump is -- well actually Trump plays golf with Charles Barkley or whomever on exactly that same premise. How different are they really? The infantile fantasies driving the Trump electorate have been stripped of Tony Starks bogus veneer of Enlightenment and MIT education but in both cases the fantasies are about disruptive levels of wealth and power big enough to overturn governments and institutions and the girly-men who stand in the way of greatness.Its nothing more than a hilarious accident that ""Captain America Civil War"" with its story of the Avengers -- a world-dominating gaggle of superheroes in case youve been comatose for the last decade -- torn apart by moral debates political squabbles and endless intensely engineered fight scenes holds faint echoes of the real-world civil war within the Republican Party. If Trump and Ted Cruz could have a big WWE-style throwdown in armor-plated Underoos that involved the destruction of an international airport and featured psychic sidekicks (Carly Fiorinas Scary Songs of Witchcraft) John Kasich shrunk down to gnat-size and a surprise appearance by Spider-Man that would be a lot more fun than flooding the Indianapolis airwaves with attack ads. Oh wait John Kasich has been shrunk to gnat-size in reality tooMuch of ""Captain America Civil War"" is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" two summers ago. I guess the enduring friendship between Chris Evans stalwart Captain America and his childhood companion Bucky (Sebastian Stan) who was engineered into a sinister super-soldier some decades back by the Soviets or Hydra or whoever the hell is important to someone. Not that much to me. Both films were directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo and written by the team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and a certain coherence and even integrity flow from that. You Might Also Like There are legitimate reasons for the amped-up eagerness of the fanbase and for the fact that this movie is already a huge hit all over the world. (One of the recent twists to the blockbuster formula is to stage the international release before the North American release partly to cut down on piracy and partly to make the movies more review-proof than they are already.) I personally find the Russo brothers lightning-fast action scenes difficult to process -- its as if cinema editing now exceeds the speed of human brain functions -- but theyre undoubtedly exciting and skillfully constructed. You generally know whos fighting whom where they are in the imaginary geography and what the objective is which are not questions that have ever troubled Michael Bay for instance.Furthermore Markus and McFeely deserve credit for trying to push the moral calculus a bit further toward real-world questions. In recent years action cinema has featured enormous amounts of collateral damage -- entire cities destroyed thousands if not millions of deaths -- which the protagonists barely seem to notice. Zack Snyders ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" tried to tackle this after its own leaden fashion but ""Civil War"" does it better. When Cap America and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and other random Avengers take down a squad of evil terrorists in Lagos Nigeria a bunch of African civilians get killed in the crossfire. Some of these are visitors from the peaceful nation of Wakanda whose benevolent king (John Kani) calls for international action against the caped vigilantes.This is all old news in the superhero universe for sure. But Tony Stark and Black Widow and War Machine (Don Cheadle) and the spectral-robot A.I. thingy known as Vision (Paul Bettany) all agree to sign a document that grants command-and-control authority over the Avengers to a special United Nations committee. Nothing could go wrong with that plan am I right? To no ones surprise Captain America -- who was asleep for 60 years or whatever and is pretty much the corporeal embodiment of American superpower hegemony -- is having none of it. He doesnt come right out and say that hes all about making America great again and that only a bunch of losers would sign an agreement written by a bunch of Third World socialist weirdos with unpronounceable names. But thats sure how it looks. Anyway when we fast forward to the end of the movie theres a giant rock-em sock-em fight between Iron Man and Captain America at a remote Cold War-era stronghold in Siberia and a bunch of characters we supposedly like get sent to a super-secret U.S. government prison so awesome it might stop Dick Cheneys heart (for like the 14th time). Along the way Downey chews up the scenery and has one moral crisis after another and for a guy who was supposedly done making Iron Man movies he has pretty much made another one right here. By contrast Evans just looks blocky and square-jawed and resolute -- he is more or less the handsome guy that Donald Trump wanted to be when he was younger -- although Cap does somewhat unexpectedly kiss someone and I have to admit that scene kind of won me over. (No it isnt Iron Man though Im not saying that tension is entirely absent.)I warned you about spoilers many paragraphs ago and I cant imagine that anyone who cares doesnt already know that theres a pileup of new and old Marvel characters herein. This isnt officially an Avengers movie I guess because Thor and the Hulk are MIA but the king of Wakandas son played with impressive screen presence by Chadwick Boseman turns out to be Mm-Hm You Know Who with the silly kitty ears and because all you people loved Paul Rudd so much in ""Ant-Man"" now were stuck with him. As I already said a certain New York City teenage web-slinging sensation is unveiled in his latest and youngest iteration played by Tom Holland who is 20 years old and quite charming and English of course. But does it speak well of Spidey or the Marvel universe or the actual human race as a whole that when a rich guy shows up in his bedroom and tells him what to do he just does it?

The bright colors have been desaturated into a crisp clean gray. So has the plot which jettisons the Avengers aliens and astral gizmos for an earthbound mano-a-enhanced-mano between Iron Man and Captain America both backed up by their dodgeball teams. Open a newspaper and there are 19 civil wars happening right now. This new Captain America makes it an even 20 while demanding we bear witness to the other headlines wed rather skim suicide bombings in Nigeria; terrorist bombings in Europe; bloodied victims sitting stunned next to ambulances; secret government prisons; and ineffectual United Nations resolutions. Enjoy your popcorn Actually you will enjoy that popcorn because Captain America Civil War isnt just the third Steve Rogers spin-off. Its the best Avengers movie to date with an all-star cast that includes so many new and newish faces that theres no time to miss Hulk and Thor the only absent Garbos. Its the Met Ball of Marvel movies -- anybody whos anybody is there and dressed in literally killer couture. Bonus fashion kudos to debut hero Black Panther played by an imperious and charismatic Chadwick Boseman whose catsuit comes with an embedded necklace and retractable vibranium manicure. (Expect to see Jaden Smith wearing a knockoff at the Video Music Awards.) In the first 10 minutes Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo make their mission clear This comic-book movie will be real. Most filmmakers mistake ""real"" for dark and punishing as though the average human is a mope surrounded by psychos. (Yes Im looking at you Batman v Superman.) But to the Russos real means relatable. The villain isnt a galactic ghoul but a mortal with a stockpile of explosives. Lacking magic hammers and giant green men our heroes fight with punches and kicks. And most relatable of all the movie finally admits that normal people matter. Usually a PG-13 movie treats bystanders like cockroaches living under the fridge. We assume theyre there when Hulk slams Iron Man into a skyscraper. Sometimes the camera captures them scattering. But wed rather not think about it and to keep a family-friendly rating these films look away from the squashed goo. I cant even count how many skyscrapers exploded in The Avengers 1 and 2. Here the big opening action sequence that sets up the film ends with telekinetic Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) accidentally firebombing one corner of a building. Yet this is the first blast to get a body count 11 dead civilians all from Black Panthers home country of Wakanda. Wanda -- otherwise known as the Scarlet Witch -- becomes the most demonized woman on the news. In the next scene Tony Stark is confronted by a grieving mother who lost her son in Sokovia. Suddenly the smash-em-up happy endings of every other Marvel film are rebuked. What have we really been cheering for? Thirteen films into the franchise this is a strange smart reversal that manages to both apologize for its past violence and reframe the entire series. It even steps back enough to question the entire Marvel blockbuster universe What if the reason Earth has suffered 13 almost-apocalypses in eight years is because the initial emergence of Iron Man enticed killers to take their best shot? (We dont buy that pass-the-blame theory for a second but cute effort cash-counting studio execs.) Marvel/DisneyWith innocent humans a protected species (at least until Thanos comes laser-blasting for them in Avengers 3) the superdudes have no one left to hurt but each other. Stark capitulates to government pressure and demands that the Avengers sign the Sokovia Accords a 117-country treaty that treats them like weaponry. Captain America cant cede his powers to bureaucrats -- his brainwashed best friend Bucky a miserable Hydra mercenary proves that a winter soldier is only as good as his commanders. When the scraggly Bucky looking like a rock star on a bender he cant remember is spotted blowing up politicians the battle lines are drawn Cap wants to bring his friend in alive. Stark declares him rogue. This time our old heroes cant both win. But theyll bludgeon each other -- and the rest of their supersquads -- trying. This all sounds bleak. It is. Yet the Russos keep the mood light enough for laughs -- a magic feat as staggering as Wanda levitating a truck. At this point we know these characters so well that they can speak in shorthand like a family reunion where everyone still cracks up at Uncle Tonys same old punch line. Anthony Mackies Falcon wrings giggles with just a wounded look. The inhumanly wise Vision (Paul Bettany) is used for comic relief unnerving people by floating into their bedrooms and offering to cook them paprikash. And Tom Hollands pubescent Peter Parker actually made me look forward to this decades third new web-slinger just by saying his own name. ""Sp-spider-man"" he stammers suddenly ashamed by his own swagger when hes too young to grow a beard. But as the title promises this sequel is all brawls -- two and a half hours of traded blows -- building up to a centerpiece battle of Black Panther versus Hawkeye versus Black Widow versus Falcon versus Rhodey versus Bucky versus Vision versus Wanda versus Spider-man versus Ant-man versus Iron Man versus O Captain our Captain. As our heroes duked it out on an airport tarmac I pictured the Russo brothers as children in their Cleveland driveway clashing their action figures together and squabbling over which toy is best. ""Falcon beats Spider-man cause he flies"" ""Nuh-uh Spider-mans webs can stick Falcon to the ground"" The Russos mega-million-dollar adult playground has that same manic energy -- it helps that these fighters are mostly athletes and engineers not Norse gods -- and the tactile smash-crash of metal hitting concrete. The camerawork is too shaky but you can still see that Black Widow gets the coolest fight choreography. (And for once the camera doesnt reward her hard work by squatting in the perfect place to get a glamour shot of her ass.) That sounds like faint praise but with Civil War the Russos have won an impossible fight Theyve gotten me eager to see the next 10 (yes 10) Marvel movies. As Black Panther growls ""The living are not done with you yet.""

Updated July 29 2016  1053 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Captain America Civil War is more than just blowing stuff up By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson May 5 2016 (...) Captain America -- aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) -- is on a mission in Nigeria with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) when a tragic miscalculation results in multiple innocent deaths.The incident prompts an international outcry for the superheroes and their colleagues in the Avengers to be brought under the control of the United Nations. Particularly insistent is U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) who views them as vigilantes who have been left to their own devices for far too long.Iron Man aka Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is sympathetic to Ross point of view. An encounter with a woman who blames the Avengers for the loss of her son has taken him aback. But Rogers bristles at the very idea of submitting to such supervision. Without their autonomy he argues the Avengers might be compromised to a dangerous degree. Battle lines are drawn with some of the Avengers siding with Rogers others with Stark. The situation only intensifies when Rogers friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) aka the Winter Soldier is targeted by the authorities -- while a mysterious man with an equally mysterious agenda (Daniel Bruhl) looks on.""Captain America Civil War"" is in some ways a commentary on the previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which have been dismissed in some quarters as little more than excuses to blow stuff up and gleefully indulge in property damage. At the end of the day its still a comic-book movie but one that actually raises serious questions about security accountability and revenge. Working from a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely brothers and co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo deliver the required thrills yet leave room for moments of reflection -- of which the actors particularly Evans and Johansson take full advantage.

With Robert Wilonsky Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Captain America Civil War the feels-like-93rd entry in Disneyas forever-going series devoted to Marvel Comicsa spandex-and-metal-clad super friends is perfectly fine a a little too rambling at two and a half hours but otherwise just the right shade of light and bright for a movie about superheroes fighting superheroes. Get to know the heroes of Captain America Civil War before you see the movie Civil War is one splash page after another filled with famous faces stuffed into Halloween costumes making jokey asides between the kicking and the punching. The first Iron Man only eight years and one Terrence Howard ago was a revelation Comic book movies wrought somber and dim when Batman began in 2005 could be fun. Civil War the third Cap movie is the culmination the first comic-book movie out of all the comic-book movies to capture what itas actually like to read a comic book when youare 12 years old.Civil War directed by Anthony and Joe Russo brothers who made the last Captain America movie along with episodes of Community is only loosely based on the comicsa aCivil Wara storyline. This isnat about superheroes being asked to reveal their secret identities but about superheroes being told to wait for the United Nationsa OK before saving the world.That suits Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) just fine Iron Man is racked with guilt over all the dead stacked up during the last few issues a| er episodes a| wait movies. Heas desperate for someone else to take responsibility convinced that with great power comes great weight he can no longer shoulder.But Cap (Chris Evans) once the good soldier isnat about to take orders from Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) or his mustache which looks just like it did when it appeared in the first issue of The Incredible Hulk in 1962. He and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) mucked up a mission resulting in dead innocents but far as heas concerned thatas the high price of doing the right thing. In short order all the brand names a Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) War Machine (Don Cheadle) Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and the Vision (Paul Bettany) a are rounded up asked to choose sides and told to square off.Theyare joined by two newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) the king of a fictional African nation out to avenge his fatheras death and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) the kid from Queens who spins a web and catches thieves just like flies. And thereas the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) Capas childhood buddy from the 1930s whoas also looking remarkably fit and trim well into the 21st century.Thereas a bad guy in here too (Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo a far more tragic figure than the comicsa Nazi baddie). But heas forgettable nothing more than a third-act plot device that leads to one last bit of hero-on-hero-on-hero action. In this image released by Disney Anthony Mackie from left Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen appear in a scene from ""Captain America Civil War."" Disney-Marvel via AP Civil War runs long because it wants to make sure no character gets short shrift - especially Hollandas giddy Spidey and Bosemanas brooding Panther as this is their launching pad for coming spin-offs. Theyare given plenty of time to make their respective cases Holland particularly given the desperate need to prove Spider-Man isnat covered in cobwebs after Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield stretched out the suit.Thereas also meant to be a deep message in this shallow kiddie pool - something about guilt retribution collateral damage and a| hey look thereas the dean from Community promoted to head of MIT. And Spider-Man fighting Ant-Man While talking about The Empire Strikes Back Well that certainly makes it easy movie of the year.

Whos the winner of this ""Civil War""? The audience. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Grim times on the Marvel superhero front in ""Captain America Civil War."" Its the Avengers (well most of them) guilt-ridden conflicted and turning against one another. Their heroics in past adventures have brought them into disfavor with the public. The collateral damage attending their world-saving exploits against the villainous likes of the terrorist Hydra organization and the rampaging robot Ultron -- smashed cities mass casualties -- have the world demanding that the brakes be put on these too-powerful do-gooders. Movie Review    Captain America Civil War with Chris Evans Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson Chadwick Boseman Sebastian Stan Anthony Mackie. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. 147 minutes. Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence action and mayhem. Several theaters.

VIEWSeaTac ordered to pay 18 million to couple it cheated in secret land grabUnlimited Digital Access. 1 for 4 weeks.Leading the guilt-ridden Avengers faction is Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Sickened by what he perceives as having been the misuse of his megacorporations high-tech weapons hes now out of the arms-manufacturing business and is buying into the need to restrain himself and his colleagues. Resisting a push to make ""enhanced"" people answerable to U.N. oversight is Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). Hes of the ""cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs"" school of superhero behavior Fighting for the greater good sometimes gets a few good folks killed. Team Tony vs. Team Cap. Choose up sides enhanced people and let the fighting begin. In this image released by Disney Anthony Mackie from left Paul Rudd Jeremy Renner Chris Evans Elizabeth Olsen and Sebastian Stan appear in a scene from ""Captain America Civil War."" (Disney-Marvel via AP) If all this sounds a little familiar its because its essentially the same basic plot as ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" Only with a lot more characters. And greater depth. And better writing. And eventually humor. Its the humor arriving late to the proceedings that saves ""Civil War"" from the curse of ""Why so serious?"" -- which sinks ""Batman v Superman"" like a torpedo below the waterline. ""Civil War"" has 12 major characters ""Avengers"" movie vets Iron Man Cap Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Falcon (Anthony Mackie) War Machine (Don Cheadle) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Vision (Paul Bettany) Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). New to the mix is Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Also familiar to Marvel fans but new to the Avengers world is Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man in his third on-screen iteration. This time hes played by young Tom Holland. And it just so happens that almost single-handedly the kid rescues ""Civil War"" from its near-oppressive solemnity. Showing up more than halfway through the pictures nearly 21/2-hour running time Hollands Spidey brings a disarming geekiness to the party. While awe-struck at being recruited by Stark hes discomfited by Tonys sarcastic dismissal of his homemade Spider suit as a ""onesie"" and his mocking ""So youre the Spiderling. Crime-fighting Spider. Youre Spider-Boy?"" In the first scene between the two of them Downey makes a welcome return to the sardonic bantering that turned Iron Man into a superstar of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Sensory overload from fight scenes and chases is delivered throughout which is expected in superhero movies. And the battle between the two super factions thats the centerpiece of the picture is a showstopper leavened with humor thanks to the antics of Ant-Man and Spidey the latter of whom cheerily tells Cap hes a ""big fan"" just before the two do battle. Working from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo who previously directed 2014s ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" handle their massive ensemble like elite-level orchestra conductors. Each character gets his or her fair share of screen time and the many subplots -- Caps Avengers-fracturing loyalty to his troubled buddy Bucky being the main one -- are connected up in such a way that each reinforces the pictures central premise. Who emerges as the winner of this ""Civil War""? The audience. The picture delivers in a big big way.

"Captain America Civil War may split audience between true believers and puzzled newbies - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Captain America Civil War may split audience between true believers and puzzled newbies Captain America Civil War movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Marvels Captain American Civil War starring Chris Evans Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson Sebastian Stan Anthony Mackie Don Cheadle Jeremy Renner Chadwick Boseman and Elizabeth Olsen. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Marvels Captain American Civil War starring Chris Evans Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson Sebastian Stan Anthony Mackie Don Cheadle Jeremy Renner Chadwick Boseman and Elizabeth Olsen. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Consider this the summer of superhero discontent.First came ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" with the twin titans of the DC Comics universe having at each other like enraged cage fighters. Now its Marvels turn and ""Captain America Civil War"" doesnt hesitate to amp up the volume. Not for this group the existential loneliness of single combat. The Avengers are split asunder with two six-person teams one lead by Captain America the other by Iron Man facing off Stanley Cup playoff style. In fact so many players go at it hammer and tongs its at moments hard to tell them apart which is not necessarily a good thing.Check out our complete summer movie guide gt;gt; Its not that ""Civil War"" directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus amp; Stephen McFeely doesnt eventually win you over doesnt turn your frustration into grudging respect. But it turns out to be a longer slog than you may anticipate unless you are a Marvel true believer who lives and breathes these characters every quirk and qualm. Captain America Civil War trailer Watch the trailer for Marvels Captain America Civil War. Watch the trailer for Marvels Captain America Civil War. See more videos For paradoxically the more the interconnectedness of Marvel films increases at warp speed (""Civil War"" is described with a straight face as ""the first film in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"" MCU for short) the more insular they become. Despite their mushrooming popularity -- 12 consecutive Marvel films and counting have debuted at the No.  spot in U.S. box office -- they are becoming increasingly exclusionary making it difficult for random first-time viewers if such people still exist to come in off the street and fully enjoy them.Yes the broad outlines of ""Civil War"" are knowable even from the title but you cant go five minutes in the film without seeing something that plays better the more of these youve seen or without feeling youre missing the joke because your Marvel memory is not as fresh as it might be.So if you dont know the origins of the villain Crossbones (Frank Grillo) his key role in the films opening feels confusing and if you dont recognize that Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) is the same person as Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross of ""The Incredible Hulk"" you are not getting full value for his moment. Most critically if you dont know the intricacies of the complicated history between  Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and his World War II buddy James ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) as revealed in the previous ""Captain America The First Avenger"" and ""Captain America Winter Soldier"" critical aspects of this films plot will be lost to you. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story With so many characters to care about and look after with so many personality trait boxes to check off ""Civil War"" has to fight hard not to seem as pro forma overall as the cameo moment for Marvels spry eminence grise Stan Lee inevitably does.All this time and energy spent in these prescribed pursuits sometimes means that things that are truly important like convincing us that the Captain America/Iron Man split is more than a convenient plot contrivance dont get the attention they need.Whatever flaws ""Batman v Superman"" had Ben Afflecks atavistic performance as the Dark Knight left you without the smallest doubt that he loathed the Krypton native. ""Civil War"" does eventually get to that point with Captain America and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) but it frankly takes a shrewd Hail Mary plot twist far into the 2-hour 27-minute running time to make it happen.Like ""Batman v Superman"" ""Captain America"" shows us early on an example of collateral damage by the good guys as the Avengers end up inflicting casualties on the unsuspecting civilians of Lagos Nigeria (magically re-created on an Atlanta sound stage) while chasing a determined evildoer.After a dressing down by the aggrieved mother (Alfre Woodard effective even in cameo) of a dead innocent Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man starts to agree with the secretary of State and 116 other nations that to avoid charges of vigilante behavior the Avengers must sign the Sokovia Accords (named after the fictional city that got pulverized during a superhero intervention in ""Avengers Age of Ultron"") and agree not to spring into action unless a U.N. panel says its OK.This does not sit well with the good Captain born into a more straightforward era who feels signing would be a dereliction of his patriotic duty. This is the issue that causes the Civil War with for those who are keeping score Falcon Ant-Man Hawkeye Scarlet Witch and Winter Soldier teaming up with Cap and Black Widow War Machine the newly introduced Black Panther Vision and Spider-Man on Iron Mans side. (Thor and the Hulk having apparently picked a good time to take vacations are not involved.)Fortunately Zemo ""Civil Wars"" main villain played by the fine German actor Daniel Bruhl is quite an interesting character. It is Zemo we see as the film begins attempting to reactivate the golem-like Winter Soldier for his own nefarious purposes.Of equal interest are the newest additions to the Avengers canon each of whom brings some welcome spice to the proceedings. Paul Rudds Ant-Man is amusingly light on his feet Chadwick Bosemans dedicated Black Panther is arresting even though hes around mainly to promote his own upcoming feature and most intriguing of all is the presence of Tom Hollands new iteration of Spider-Man a character whose appearance involved such complex negotiations between Disney and rival studio Sony they put the Sokovia Accords to shame.On the plus side as has become the norm with Marvel films the cost-the-earth action stunts are the best money can buy and ""Captain America Civil War"" finally works its will on us wearing us down with the weight of its self-importance as much as anything else. If you live and breathe Marvel this is one of the MCUs stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold the answer is not so clear.MOREWith Captain America Civil War Sebastian Stan crosses over from parts unknownHow The Captain America Civil War directors went from cult creators to superhero wranglers Every single movie coming out this summerBlockbuster summer Fan favorites like Ghostbusters Star Trek and Tarzan crash the superhero party Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-0505-captain-america-civil-war-review-20160504-snap-story.html,200,captainamericacivilwar20,captainamericacivilwar,latimes

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday May 4 Follow AnnHornaday Anthony and Joe Russos ""Captain America Civil War"" is jam packed with Marvel super heroes and has The Posts David Betancourt and Michael Cavna wondering if it is the new standard for super hero movies. ( Erin Patrick OConnor / The Washington Post) Its almost not fair that ""Captain America Civil War"" is opening barely a month after ""Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice."" The movies share so much from their escapist origins to their melodramatic themes of male honor and revenge to ambivalence toward unchecked power that comparisons arent just inevitable but required. ""Civil War"" is by far the more dynamic entertaining film -- and not surprisingly so considering how well Disney has shepherded the Marvel Comics Universe to big-screen dominance. Crisply photographed thoughtfully acted and often refreshingly amusing ""Civil War"" injects doses of much-needed fun into a genre of filmmaking thats become mired in dour pretentiousness when its not ridiculing its own excesses in such meta-snark exercises as ""Deadpool."" [Why Captain America is Marvels most important franchise] For all its considerable strengths though ""Civil War"" deserves mention with ""Batman v. Superman"" in one other respect which is to suggest that the comic book spectacle is in danger of collapsing under its own weight. Overcrowded and overlong it often plays less like a breathlessly awaited chapter of a rousing serial than a series of concussive set pieces strung together by vignettes that are either deeply serious or disarmingly witty as the occasion requires. Its sheer bigness ultimately begins to work against it -- as does the troubling tendency of the characters to talk just enough to express their feelings of bitterness and regret but never enough to actually clear up a misunderstanding or solve an impending crisis. For that only bare-knuckle mano-a-mano confrontation will do. And to quote the movie itself these characters will never stop. [""Captain America Civil War"" belongs on the Mount Rushmore of superhero cinema] ""Civil War"" opens in Nigeria with an anarchic spectacularly explosive action sequence involving gunfire car crashes fistfights and an acrobatic chase through a Lagos marketplace. The bludgeoning continues throughout the film which bristles with undifferentiated hostility and aggression amped up by a fragmented filming and editing style that gives the action a jittery hyper-caffeinated edge. Everybodys jacked up and angry -- jangry -- in ""Captain America Civil War."" The world is jangry at the Avengers for their vigilantism and wanton destruction of cities and citizens in their pursuit of justice. Captain America (Chris Evans) is jangry because the U.S. government wants to subject the team to the oversight of the United Nations. Tony Stark -- played in a characteristically smooth turn by Robert Downey Jr. -- is jangry because of abandonment issues that have lingered since the tragic death of his parents (John Slattery and Hope Davis). And Im jangry because Disney hasnt seen fit to give Scarlett Johansson her own Black Widow movie yet. Its a setup worthy of Bruce Wayne himself. But thankfully ""Civil War"" isnt nearly the moody slog that Bat-v-Supes turned out to be thanks in large part to directors Joe and Anthony Russo. As in their previous outing ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" the brothers display a fine sense of craft here executing the story and set pieces alike with efficiency and finesse. If the pummeling numbingly protracted fight sequences begin to take on a sense of diminishing returns -- especially after an impressively choreographed showdown at the Berlin airport -- the Russos at least try to balance them with genuine character development during the quieter moments. As Iron Man and Tony Stark Robert Downey Jr. very nearly steals the show in ""Captain America Civil War."" (Film Frame/Marvel) As Captain America and Steve Rogers Chris Evans shows off his muscles and determination. (Zade Rosenthal/Marvel) Toward that end the filmmakers focus mostly on the title character -- played by Evans in another appealingly sincere straight-arrow performance -- and Iron Man/Stark who almost steals ""Civil War"" from his brother-in-arms. Downey has been accused of mugging in the past but here hes energetically on point as a master of the universe whos been brought down a peg since the last episode. Its Tony who features in the films best scenes including a clever CGI-enhanced flashback thats staged not just with technical skill but mournfully authentic emotion. (As for the fantasies of inflated potency these allegories are meant to stoke and indulge Evans provides the films most indelible image when he flexes improbably buff biceps and -- literally single-handedly -- prevents a helicopter from taking off.) To single out the seemingly dozens of characters who show up in ""Civil War"" by name would possess the excitement of a fourth-grade roll call. Suffice it to say that rather than psychic powers or super-strength casting has always been the Marvel movies secret weapon. That holds true here up to and including charismatic newcomers Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and 19-year-old Tom Holland the latter of whom as Spider-Man plays off Downey with the seeming self-effacement of an old pro. [Welcome to the Marvel universe Spider-Man and Black Panther] Downey and Hollands first scene together is a delight as is the deepening friendship between Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) and some comic relief by way of a miniaturized franchise-hopping Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. As for the rest of the Avengers its inexplicably reassuring to see the band get back together -- albeit on opposing sides of the exceptionalism-accountability debate and without a couple of key players whose absence is duly noted. ""Captain America Civil War"" fills the screen with superheroes From left Falcon (Anthony Mackie) Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Captain America (Chris Evans) Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Bucky (Sebastian Stan). (Disney/Marvel/Associated Press) As enjoyable as it is ""Civil War"" often teeters on the brink of sheer overkill. As viewers approach the films second hour they could be forgiven for wondering just how much more carnage chaos and character-establishing they can take. The Russos are at their best when theyre camouflaging their movies real intentions which is to tee up the more than a dozen Avengers movies planned into 2020 (including those anchored by Boseman and Holland). ""Captain America Civil War"" acquits that duty with taste skill and welcome pizzazz -- even when it threatens to become way too much of a good thing. PG-13. At area theaters.

Ha Thats nothing compared to Disneys Law of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With every new installment of the comic book franchise the scale gets bigger relationships get trickier new forces enter the fray. In Captain America Civil War the 13th title in Disney and Marvels systematic plan for global domination a dozen superheroes come and go lining up on either side of a tumultuous ideological dispute. This may be the first film since Avatar that truly necessitates viewing in a gargantuan format On a plain old normal-size 2-D screen all these superhumans could get lost in the crowd and in the accelerated blur of action mayhem and snappy quipping. In Captain America Civil War the superdudes (and dudettes) crisis of identity of purpose begins with an earnest attempt on the part of a squad of Avengers - Steve Rogers Captain America (Chris Evans) Natasha Romanoffs Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Sam Wilsons Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Wanda Maximoffs Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) - to thwart a plan to steal biological weapons from a lab in Lagos. Poor Wanda still struggling to master her hex powers (lots of waving of hands and wrinkling of forehead) and lacking a cool costume like her peers wields more hex than she should resulting in the death of 11 innocent people. When news - and news footage - of the calamitous combat is broadcast around the world Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt with a mustache) convenes a meeting at Avengers HQ back in New York. Are you heroes or vigilantes? he asks Tony Starks Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) the Captain and the crew informing them that 117 countries have agreed to sign ""the Sokovia Accords"" which will establish a governing body to monitor - and approve the missions of - the superheroes. No more pro-active interventions. And in theory no more collateral damage. Stark and Romanoff agree to go along with the plan Rogers and his pals doesnt like it. Its Team Cap v Team Iron Man - let the games begin. This issue - well-meaning mighty saviors of mankind or rogue players wreaking havoc? - has long been at the heart of the comic book world. Its a debate that the X-Men have had to contend with (and will no doubt again when X-Men Apocalypse opens in three weeks) and that provided the motive and momentum behind Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice. If you want to get hifalutin about it its also an issue thats been running through the presidential campaigns Should the U.S. act unilaterally in conflicts and crises overseas or should some group like the United Nations determine when and what actions are necessary? But lets not get hifalutin. Instead lets go looking for an uber-baddie with a German accent which is who well find pulling the strings in Captain America Civil War. He is Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) a madman bent on destroying the Avengers who uses a series of trigger words (""Longing. . ."" ""Benign. . ."" ""Freight train. . ."") to unleash the thawed ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) on the world. Bucky formerly the Captains sidekick and one of the so-called ""Winter soldiers"" whove been hanging out in a cryogenics chamber has been programmed a la The Manchurian Candidate. The Bucky doesnt stop here - hes everywhere doing evil stuff. If you havent read or watched or heard anything about who shows up in Captain America Civil War - and if you care - you may want to stop right now and go get a latte or something. Perhaps the most significant introduction in sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russos all-but-inevitable blockbuster is that of TChalla a.k.a. Black Panther the African superhero who is played by Chadwick Boseman and who is getting his own stand-alone movie coming in 2018 to be directed by Creeds Ryan Coogler. A new Spider-Man also rises although Downeys Iron Man aptly cracks that he should be called Spider-Boy. Young Tom Holland gets the role. His Spider-Man Homecoming is set for July 2017.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday May 04 2016 1226PM EDT Last updated Wednesday May 04 2016 1228PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely Starring Chris Evans Robert Downey Jr. Classification PG Genre fantasy Year 2016 Country USA Language English With great power comes great responsibility or so says a dying Ben Parker in the 2002 film Spider-Man. While the forever-doomed Uncle Ben was trying to instill a sense of justice in his young nephew Peter his final words also serve as the guiding philosophy at Marvel Studios which has been entrusted with Earths mightiest heroes or at least their naming rights. Ever since the premiere of 2008s Iron Man Hollywoods most powerful players have been holding their collective breath waiting for the Marvel powers that be to nick themselves as they furiously unwrap toy after toy from their massive intellectual property treasure chest. Yet with the exception of two Hulk misfires the studio has defied the odds and figured out the perfect formula for a superhero blockbuster one thats allowed them to exploit name-brand characters (Captain America Thor) just as easily as whos-that-again oddities (Groot Ant-Man).Its not as if Marvel has patented some unknowable cinematic algorithm. Its tried and true method is right up there on the screen each time a refined mix of up-and-coming directors not yet commanding huge salaries (Joss Whedon James Gunn) familiar-enough stars with backgrounds in comedy (Robert Downey Jr. Chris Pratt) splosion-heavy action thats actually easy to follow and a keen sense of story continuity that ensures one films developments affect an entire universe worth of other narratives.Most importantly though Marvel knows what everyone else in the industry seems to forget Superheroes are supposed to be fun. The reason Spidey and Nick Fury and Doctor Strange and the rest of the Avengers succeeded way back when they first debuted in comic form was because they were light whiz-bang diversions from a real world that was often cruel and calculating. Every Marvel film has embraced that same sense of levity expertly balanced against the varied demands of modern blockbuster cinema.All of which makes Captain America Civil War such a rousing success and a stinging rebuke to Marvels many imitators. It might be unfair to compare this the studios 13th superhero film to something like Batman v Superman Warners second but in nearly every way Civil War represents the dizzying heights of the genre.Where Zack Snyders clash of the titans was dark malicious and crassly designed to wring maximum profit by promising more than it could deliver Joe and Anthony Russos Civil War is a shiny immensely attractive work of pop art that acknowledges the obligations of the genre without wallowing in cynicism or cash-grab stunts.Okay that last line might be difficult to swallow for anyone whos glimpsed the films sprawling cast which is a stunt in and of itself. In addition to its title hero (Chris Evans whose bulging biceps are their own unique special effect) Captain America Civil War throws in about 75 per cent of the Avengers (Thor and Hulk are missing but only because theyre busy prepping Thor Ragnarok) a few long-absent frenemies (including William Hurts General Ross last glimpsed in 2008s The Incredible Hulk) plus two new superheroes. Well new-ish.First theres Spider-Man released from his contract at Sony which has finally given up trying to reboot the webslinger after watching two franchises fall apart. Second theres Black Panther a hero hinted at in previous Marvel films but only glimpsed in the flesh - or rather in his super-strong and unnervingly sexy Wakandian suit - here. Both are given excellent life by new-to-Marvel stars (Tom Holland for Spidey Chadwick Boseman for Black Panther) but both are really only in Civil War to lay the groundwork for their own upcoming films (July 2017 and February 2018 respectively - reserve your tickets today).The films central conflict positions the libertarian Steve Rogers against the suddenly pro-authority Tony Stark (Downey Jr. smirking forever) for reasons that seem a bit too convenient. In any other series such a manipulative hero vs. hero setup would fall flat. Yet because weve had a dozen movies immersed in Marvels universe because the Russos know how to inject emotional weight into conversational scenes just as much as action set-pieces and because Evans and Downey Jr. wear their roles so well the conflict is gut-wrenching.Any war asks you to choose a side but its impossible to cheer here for one hero or another - you believe theyre both right and worthy in their own way. Civil War is an action movie whose main villain is not some all-powerful superbeing but the conflicting emotions of its heroes. (That said there are some all-powerful superbeings here and there.)Still the sheer weight of the two-and-a-half-hour film can overwhelm. The Russos for instance spend so much time on building character and navigating the layered plot that their visuals occasionally fall flat. The brothers Captain America The Winter Soldier delivered an authoritative sleek mix of greys and blues the strong colours of a hardened spy thriller.In Civil War the only signature aesthetics seem to be the intimidating placelines popping up throughout the film - LAGOS VIENNA SIBERIA - and the smoothly shot if perhaps overly stretched chase scenes.Then again comic books were never known for their restraint and every moment of excess is balanced out by one of high comedy or delightful world-building. With Civil War Marvel Studios has proven once again that the worlds heroes remain in good hands.

Entertainment In ""Civil War"" A Superheros Toughest Challenge Is Accountability For all the superhero-on-superhero battling that goes down in Marvels latest the trickiest foe the Avengers face turns out to be accountability. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Anthony Mackie Paul Rudd Jeremy Renner Chris Evans Elizabeth Olsen and Sebastian Stan make up Team Cap in Captain America Civil War. Marvel Studios ID 8563990 2016 is the year that superhero movies confront their collateral damage.Its an idea thats already crept into Netflixs expanding suite of Marvel series all of them taking place in a battered New York still in recovery after the first Avengers film where superhero worship exists alongside distrust over how Manhattan was made to serve as a battleground. That was also the point of the best scene in the grim jumble that was Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice which presented a street-level view of Superman and General Zods brawl through Metropolis from Man of Steel. One of those two godlike beings means well but from there on the ground they look the same -- indifferent to the humans scurrying for their lives far below.Captain America Civil War features its own script-flipping depiction of innocents dying as a side effect of its characters actions. The movie which was directed by Winter Soldiers Anthony and Joe Russo picks up in Lagos where Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and a still-in-training Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) are trying to stop the theft of a biological weapon. View this image > Johansson Marvel Studios ID 8564004 Its all going smoothly with chases through busy byways and some bruisingly satisfying Black Widow fight sequences until it isnt A last-ditch bomb gets set off in the middle of a crowded marketplace. In her efforts to contain the explosion Wanda ends up letting it take out a floor of a nearby building instead -- and the record scratches all the high-impact heroics ending in a flinch. The superheroes leave a scene in which bodies are being pulled out on stretchers day saved at an unexpected and unwanted cost.Among the dead and wounded are some visitors from Wakanda which allows for the introduction of the royal TChalla (Chadwick Boseman) also known as the Black Panther but also ignites an international debate over whether the Avengers need to be regulated whether those casualties were a fuck-up that could have been avoided why they dont care about international borders and sovereignty and whether it was their business being there in Nigeria the first place. The Avengers are fresh off kinda-sorta being responsible for the creation of an artificial intelligence that tried to cause the extinction of mankind by dropping a chunk of the Sokovian capital from the sky so they werent in the best standing to begin with. A reel of their recent exploits is played back to them as they cringe all those de rigueur building-crushing big finales repositioned not as hard-won triumphs but as incidents of mass destruction. View this image > Chadwick Boseman Paul Bettany Robert Downey Jr. Johansson and Don Cheadle as Team Iron Man in Captain America Civil War. Marvel Studios ID 8563992 Sinister shadow organizations malevolent masterminds figures from the past intent on revenge and power-hungry siblings -- turns out theres no foe as quietly formidable as accountability. Accountability isnt a theme that screams ""escapist fun"" but it is a nagging issue underlying almost every story about superheroes whove taken it upon themselves to fight crime and evil and its the source of the conflict in the improbably good Civil War. Its easier to deal with the sacrifices that heroes might have to make to save the city and/or the world than to suggest that not everyone they leave behind is tearily grateful. But as the genre has expanded and matured and demanded to be taken seriously on screen its a theme that becomes unavoidable especially in a series thats made a point of having consequences carry over after each fade to black and credits roll. View this image > Tom Holland. Marvel Studios ID 8564012 Spider-Man who is reintroduced in Civil War as a squeaky-voiced teenage chatterbox played by Tom Holland paraphrases a version of his ""With great power comes great responsibility"" motto. But believing that because you can help you should doesnt make you immune from the question of who gave you the right to play savior especially when youre a red white and blue-clad patriotic symbol whos decided to go global. And then theres the point Vision (Paul Bettany) raises which is that by demonstrating their power the Avengers seem to be luring more antagonists out than ever before ""Our very strength incites challenge.""Captain America Civil War isnt the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe the worlds largest-scale slowest-released television show masquerading as a series of films; Id still give the edge to the unfettered geeky joy of Guardians of the Galaxy and the tense paranoia of Winter Soldier (and who would have guessed that sad square Steve Rogers would be at the center of two of the franchises most interesting movies?).But Civil War is the MCUs most thematically ambitious installment setting up the decision of whether the Avengers are going to allow themselves to be governed by a U.N. panel seriously and allowing the accrued history of the 12 previous films to weigh on it. On one side youve got Captain America whos got a post-Hydra libertarianish distrust of large organizations but a greater faith in individuals including poor brainwashed Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) whos once again made into a pawn of the unfolding plot. And on the other side youve got Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) whose life story has basically been that of a nose-thumbing capitalist longing for regulations to bump up against forever going too far and then being confronted as he is in the movie with the ramifications of what hes done. View this image > Downey Jr. and Evans. Marvel Studios ID 8564014 Its a disagreement the movie treats with regretful inevitability like a family dinner thats about to dissolve into a fight because no one can keep the conversation from veering toward politics. Theres a villain in Civil War an undramatic but highly motivated man named Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) but all he really does is force confrontations that were brewing or bound to happen eventually. He prods at the right cracks and the superhero supergroup ends up splitting right down the middle with newcomers and recent additions like the aforementioned Black Panther (to whom Boseman brings gravitas and welcome frankness about looking out for his own) Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man getting divvied up over the two teams.It all escalates into a group showdown thats gloriously fun (despite some of the characters feeling spliced in from a much more chipper movie) and genuinely sad because if youve made it through eight years of Marvel features you care about these quippy oddballs and their imperfect alliance. Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice had its costumed duo try to punch each other to death over their ideological differences before declaring themselves inexplicable friends. Civil War is all about friends coming to blows over fundamental disagreements they dont really settle (though the movie tilts sympathy to one side) with all sorts of personal resentments and loyalties and surfacing secrets mixed in. For once fittingly the fallout isnt on a large scale with a city to be half-demolished and civilians to be sheltered but that doesnt make it feel any less potent. Its like watching a breakup in which both parties land punches only most of them are literal.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The most impressive superpower on display in ""Captain America Civil War"" isnt Tony Stark flying in a tin suit or Steve Rogers throwing a hefty shield like a Frisbee. Its the whole teams ability to give an escapist comic book movie an intelligent sense of connection to life in the modern world. The 13th film in the eight-year-old Disney/Marvel Cinematic Universe is straight-up entertainment and a cautionary tale. Echoing their paranoid political thriller approach in 2014s ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" directors Anthony and Joe Russo throw a wrench into every received convention we expect from genre movies. This follow-up digs further into security procedures that often feel more invasive than protective. Here the vainglorious Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and true-blue Rogers (Chris Evans) who have long had a conflicted relationship butt heads and every other body part. In his previous outing Stark helped the Avengers defeat the monstrous Ultron decimating the European nation of Sokovia in the process. A new defense mission bringing trainee Avengers Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to Africa triggers another collateral body count. The ongoing costs of victory throw our heroes into debate about the uses of power as the means to an uncertain end. His conscience dirtied Stark supports a global initiative to place superpowered vigilantes under international control. Rogers refuses to abide by an agreement submitting the squad to dubious authorities. The longtime allies each draw rival factions into the ethical showdown. Captan America Civil War 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for extended sequences of violence action and mayhem. It grows from debate to pitched battle when Bucky ""The Winter Soldier"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) once a brainwashed secret soldier for evildoers is accused of fallout fatalities linked to the Avengers. He claims hes not guilty and Cap who has been his friend since World War II believes him. The story arc makes both sides collide in a battle royal that is both a critique and a celebration of highly caffeinated bravado. Here the unbelievably precise action choreography is not used to showcase masculine aggression not entirely. The film makes Captain America -- a moral icon of Americas last good war -- a hero of calmer times its title character quite deliberately. Analogies to social issues have been a hallmark of Marvels imaginary world since Stan Lee co-created the X-Men a civil rights allegory whose leaders Professor X and Magneto were based on the pious Martin Luther King Jr. and brash Malcolm X. Its a tradition continuing here in a story where the emotional repercussions of conflict carry genuine pathos. I have watched state of the union addresses less meaningful and moving. The film is not all arguments chase scenes and showdowns. Paul Rudds Ant-Man and perfectly cast newcomer Tom Holland playing a high school Spider-Man give the grandiose activity delightfully bonkers comic relief. If youd like to see what its like when three big superheroes cram themselves into a VW Beetle or hear how it sounds when Spidey yelps some salty language prepare to slap your thighs numb. Theyre enormously funny because they give the superheroes a human everyman dimension something rarely seen in projects adapted from Saturday morning cartoons. The film takes all the time it needs to be witty and complex exciting and moving. At 2 1/2 hours its a behemoth but one that never bored me for a beat. I dont think this is the finest Marvel film to date a title that belongs to Joss Whedons incomparable 2012 ""The Avengers."" But after the dumpster fire of ""Batman v Superman"" this is a glorious lesson on how to make concrete-shattering comic book throw-downs irresistibly entertaining.

But in the case of ""Captain America Civil War"" a divided house brings out the best in this supersized superhero franchise.""Captain America Civil War"" is an ambitious undertaking a massive venture that could have easily felt bloated and overblown much like Marchs corrosive joyless ""Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice."" Instead ""Civil War"" is lithe and lean no small feat considering it features a dozen superheroes vying for screen time and runs a wink shy of the two-and-a-half hour mark.Credit directors Joe and Anthony Russo the sitcom veterans who also helmed 2014s ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" (and who are also on board for the next two ""Avengers"" films). They strike the right balance of serious and silly knowing when to go action-heavy and when to lighten the mood (the script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is always ready with a quick quip). Most importantly they keep everything constantly moving and never forget to have fun. This is after all a story about costumed superheroes not life or death material.""Civil War"" draws a line in the sand for the Avengers with Captain America (Chris Evans handsomely anchoring his third Cap film) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. wearing the role of the snarky Tony Stark like a well-tailored suit) heading up rival factions of the super squad.At issue is the question of accountability and the governing of the all-powerful ""enhanced individuals"" as theyre known in the film. ""Batman V Superman"" raised similar questions about the policing of superheroes (although it also took on elements of religious allegory) but ""Civil War"" takes a much more practical approach with Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) introducing legislation that will require the Avengers to answer to the collateral damage their missions produce. Turns out a lot of innocent people die when you level a city battling alien forces.Put simply Iron Man agrees with the proposal and Captain America does not. This causes a rift and forces the other members of their team - including Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson who still needs her own Black Widow movie) War Machine (Don Cheadle) Falcon (Anthony Mackie) Scarlet Witch (Lizzie Olsen) and newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) - to choose sides. And those sides clash in a mega battle on an airport tarmac that exemplifies the films mix fun and flash.Its no major plot secret that ""Civil War"" also introduces a new Spider-Man and the films handling of him is a perfect example of its efficient style. Stark visits young Peter Parker (Tom Holland) in the Queens apartment of his aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and over the course of a few short minutes Parkers motivations and storyline are established. No need for an overdrawn origin story that clunkily rehashes the same old plot points; ""Civil War"" trusts the audience enough to know who Parker is why hes here and where hes headed. From there its up to Holland to let loose in the role and his Spidey is a youthful B-12 shot to the aging Avengers team. (Bonus points for giving his mask the ability to digitally emote.)After the big battle ""Civil War"" goes further into the beef between Cap and Iron Man and both Evans and Downey Jr. turn in strong work in their respective roles. But ""Civil War"" never gets bogged down its as skillfully plotted as the rollout of all the Marvel films and properties that led us to this point in the series.""Civil War"" isnt so much a Captain America or an Iron Man film as it is a third ""Avengers"" movie (Hulk and Thor are name-checked but alas are nowhere to be seen) and its worthy of the first two movies in the series. It is a smart fun highly entertaining blockbuster. This house divided stands tall.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284agrahamdetroitnews.com 34 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/26S2lj2 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2016/05/04/review-captain-americas-civil-war-audience-wins/83911928/,200,captainamericacivilwar27,captainamericacivilwar,detroitnews

Photo Associated Press Image 45 of 45 Captain America Civil War When the good guys cant get along 1 / 45 Back to Gallery Blockbuster season blasts into life with the release of ""Captain America Civil War."" An action bombardment of quick cuts and images that shine and flicker across the screen it features various characters of various abilities getting into lots of fights. And this time its weird This time the good guys are fighting each other. The latest in a seemingly endless series of Marvel Comics movies ""Civil War"" has all the conflicts explosions and dead bodies that like barbecues and pool parties just say ""summer"" in that special way. But what makes ""Civil War"" interesting -- ultimately frustrating but interesting all the same -- is that its a movie with ideas. Its impossible to watch it without making subtle moral judgments sometimes involving choosing between two unattractive choices. Theres an intelligence about it though at times its an intelligence in conflict with itself. The good news is that ""Civil War"" does not take the easy out. Given the appealingly smug personality of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) the path of least resistance would have been to make Stark into a bad guy this time. But the movie doesnt do that. In fact Stark who leads one faction of the Avengers (a consortium of superheroes) in battle against the other can be seen as the most sympathetic character in the movie. He is certainly the most complicated and arresting. Captain America Civil War Captain America Civil War is looking to dominate this weekends box. The film is projected to earn something in the region of 200 million in its debut weekend. That means Civil War will likely become one of top five domestic Media WochIt Media The premise of ""Civil War"" turns on the same issues raised in ""Batman v Superman"" but the treatment is much more assured. At the start of the film the Avengers team is in a foreign country trying to stop a terrorist group from stealing a biological weapon. They succeed but in the process they end up being responsible for the deaths of scores of innocent civilians. This is where the United States government intervenes in the person of William Hurt as the secretary of state. He wants the Avengers to cease activity as a private entity and instead come under the jurisdiction of a United Nations committee. This is in itself a curiously conciliatory gesture though no one in the movie comments on it. The United Nations? Not the U.S. Department of Defense? The Avengers are dealt an ultimatum Sign the treaty or face government sanction. What should they do? Viewers must make this judgment for themselves. Heres one way to consider it -- bring it into real-life terms Would you rather have John Kerry and Barack Obama leading American foreign policy or Elizabeth Olsen and Chris Evans? Just the idea of having a flashy egotistical billionaire running our foreign affairs is already a daunting prospect for many. Imagine having one going around in an invincible Iron Man suit. In fact to his credit billionaire Tony Stark signs the treaty and so does the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). But Captain America (Evans) not only wont sign he regards the idea of signing as a moral capitulation a betrayal of soul and self akin to Neville Chamberlains signing the Munich treaty with Hitler. And heres the thing thats strange This is a ""Captain America"" movie. If the movies point of view is with any of the characters its with Captain America. But almost everything that follows actually strengthens the argument against him even though the movie never acknowledges it. So ""Captain America"" is a curious case. More convincingly than ""Batman v Superman"" it suggests that people born with special powers arent best equipped to know how to use them. In ""Batman v Superman"" the argument was subverted by the fact that Superman is such a moral exemplar that its hard to imagine those powers in safer hands. But in ""Captain America"" the idea cant be refuted. Its there as a rebuke against the whole notion of a band of immature people -- mostly young unformed individuals with no gifts save for combat and destruction -- holding sway over the lives of everyone else on the planet. ""Captain America Civil War"" goes as far as it can in illustrating the complicated problems posed by these individuals. And in the process it ties itself up into a knot it cant untangle. You cant have an Avengers movie that argues that the world would be better without the Avengers after all. So in the last 30 minutes of this long movie the filmmakers cut the knot. They pretend that the Avengers are a great thing after all and they count on our not noticing the disingenuousness. Most of us wont. Those of us who do see it will recognize the Avengers not as heroic but as a metaphor for solipsism run rampant. They represent a cast of mind in which the self and the selfs unique powers are everything and no one else really matters or exists. In an era in which we are all our very own superhero no wonder superheroes are objects of worship. They provide a socially acceptable cover for worship of the self. So as a work of thought ""Civil War"" is compromised but at least there are thoughts to compromise. As an action film it has its moments but aside from the big opening sequence -- in which the entire gang goes after terrorists -- the action scenes are a bit flat. Theyre flat for a simple reason no suspense. For example if theres a fight between Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Captain America you know neither will get killed. Moreover no matter where you stand on the treaty theres not much of a rooting interest. Though a part of me would love to see all the superheroes kill each other -- it would be good for the world within the movie and it wouldnt hurt the art of film either -- its hard to root against the good guys. Fortunately the very complications that diminish the action sequences serve to add complexity to the performances. True as Captain America Chris Evans doesnt really do much in his own movie -- hes of necessity something of a big stiff morally rigid and mostly wrong. But Robert Downey Jr. gets to remind everybody that before this blockbuster turn he was actually a serious actor and may still be again. Starks frustration at the rigidity and shortsightedness of his confreres and his anguish at where it all leads are vivid and felt. Downey is enough to make you think that an Avengers movie with no action at all might still be good. It might even be an improvement. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Captain America Civil War | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; captain-america-civil-war ) Captain America Civil War (United States 2016) May 04 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoiler Alert Nothing overt but I hint at some plot developments that some readers may not want to know about until after theyve seen the movie. Depends on your concerns about a ""virgin movie-going experience."" Despite the name Captain America Civil War feels more like an Avengers movie than a Captain America one (not withstanding Caps participation in both series). Those who attend this movie expecting to see a superhero smack-down wont be disappointed but anyone partial to Captain Americas saga may feel shortchanged. Although Civil War doesnt ignore the events of Avengers 2 Age of Ultron (something Im sure many fans wish was the case) it glosses over them. Instead this is posited as a direct follow-up to Captain America Winter Soldier. To the extent that Civil War can be said to focus on any one of a myriad of subplots (there are too many) it revolves around the fractious relationship between Captain America (Chris Evans) and his childhood friend-turned-Manchurian Candidate Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Once again captured by bad guys and reprogrammed to kill The Winter Soldier returns to the nemesis column - at least for part of the movie. Aside from the Cap/Bucky relationship Civil War is about adding a real-world element to the existence of The Avengers. Viewed with increasing distrust by nations around the world the superhero group is asked to accept oversight by an international commission. Several of The Avengers - Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Vision (Paul Bettany) - reluctantly agree. Others - Cap Falcon (Anthony Mackey) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) - believe that autonomy is critical. Newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) side with Iron Man. Thus are the battle lines drawn and what starts as a political argument evolves into an all-out war. Consequences however are disappointingly limited. The recent Batman v. Superman attempted (with limited success) to address the subject of collateral damage from superhero actions - that the number of civilian casualties is unacceptable even when the objective (usually eliminating a supervillain threat) is achieved. Civil War goes down the same road with William Hurt and Martin Freeman providing the ""voices of reason."" The concept of a government body regulating superhero actions is intriguing but its neither well considered nor effectively implemented in Civil War. In general the X-Men stories have done a better job of this. But at least this movie addresses the subject matter rather than continuing to ignore it. The films success rests with its ability to match fans expectations when it comes to the superhero-on-superhero violence. Back in the 1970s and 1980s cross-over comic book battles were always big sellers and this is just the next step in their evolution. As in the comic books nothing really bad happens when the good guys rumble despite the serious issues in play. So Civil War features a lot of pummeling and punching and blowing things up (which is quite fun in its own right) but thats about it. Plus with so much happening during the big battle co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo are unable to keep up with the action. Some characters are left in limbo until the camera gets back around to them. This is a problem when so many characters are involved and the filmmakers dont want to shortchange any of them. Late in the proceedings an intimate fracas is more powerful provocative and compelling. That sequence works in a way that the battle royale fan service doesnt. The stakes which have personal as well as larger implications are high. Theres drama in that fight; it isnt only about spectacle. Marvels desire to integrate the Spider-Man character as quickly as possible into the so-called ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" results in some poor storytelling choices. Although Spider-Man provides a valuable contribution to the battle his painfully bad introduction hurts the movie as a whole. Given an opportunity Tom Holland might grow into a credible Peter Parker but this isnt an auspicious beginning. Thrust into the deep end as he is here its hard to get much of a feel for the character or his circumstances. And as much as I admire Marisa Tomei its hard to think of a more bizarre casting choice for the role of Aunt May. The decision to give Ant-Man his own movie has proven to be the right move because unlike Spider-Man he isnt thrown into the fray without context. Paul Rudds Scott Lang feels like he belongs. And although Spider-Man is better known (arguably Marvels most recognizable superhero) the same cannot be said about this Peter Parker. For all the right decisions Marvel has made about meticulously building their universe this misstep mirrors DCs choice to cram Wonder Woman into Batman v. Superman for no reason beyond rushing her to the screen. The productions tone makes a refreshing change from the dour gloomy approach adopted by Zack Snyder in Batman v. Superman. The purpose here is to entertain viewers rather than depress them. Tony Starks dialogue is peppered with his usual cynical one-liners. Spider-Man quips and banters as he fights (one of his opponents makes a comment about this). And not every scene takes place at night or in the rain. There are plenty of dark moments but they are counterbalanced by lighter scenes. Comic book-influenced movies have reached a point where each one is more interested in outdoing its predecessors than telling a good story. The Avengers remains the best team-up movie to-date - nothing in the past few years has come close to toppling it from that perch. Deadpool is the most entertaining superhero feature to have graced theaters since the 2012 blockbuster. Civil War is better than either the bloated Avengers 2 or the lugubrious Batman v. Superman but its not as gripping as Winter Soldier. As far as big superhero mash-ups are concerned this one whets the appetite without providing a satisfying main course. Marvel continues to tease us about Big Things Yet To Come. One hopes that when they happen theyll be able to fulfill the expectations resulting from the hype and build-up.

More News Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones The Hulk The Last Angry Man How Superhero Movies Became Too Big To Fail Top 40 Marvel Movie Ideas Ranked All Stories >> Related Captain America Why Chris Evans Is the Anxious Avenger Superhero-movie star on the pressures of being a Marvel MVP ""I love acting -- but thats not all youre asking me to do"" The issue for these paragons of Marvel branding is collateral damage. Look at the mess these comic-book weapons of mass destruction left at the end of Avengers Age of Ultron. Buildings toppled. Property destroyed. Civilian casualties. The Secretary of State (William Hurt radiating Trump-like bluster) declares this will not stand. The United Nations demands accountability. Surprisingly Iron Man agrees. The Cap ever the rugged individualist does not. Let the games begin. Wait -- what? Fanboys buying a ticket to an Avengers smackdown are going to be lectured on the evils of vigilantism? Isnt the damage purely digital? Did Marvel suits learn nothing from DC Comics when the dark cloud of pessimism  hung a cinematic pall over Batman v Superman? Relax. Once the sermons die down the action intensifies without letup. Pow Pow Pow You only have to pick sides. Are you Team Iron Man or Team Cap? It always comes down to who has the coolest  gadgets. The Cap -- all praise to Evans for bringing a charming quirk to this retro straight-arrow -- has that wicked shield plus the support of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) Falcon (Anthony Mackie) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Iron Man -- all praise to the quip-ready Downey -- has that bracing wit that can cut through any and all script grandiosity plus War Machine (Don Cheadle) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Vision (Paul Bettany) and the young Spider-Man (a scene-stealing Tom Holland). The Hulk and Thor are no-shows. Nobody can figure out whats going on with TChalla a.k.a. Black Panther (a terrific Chadwick Boseman) except his hate-on for Bucky Barnes a.k.a. Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) the Caps BFF except when the brainwashing kicks in and the Winter dude turns lethal. Iron Man calls him ""the Manchurian Candidate."" Nice one. But for sheer villainy theres no one sneakier or more dangerous than Zemo (a sly hissable Daniel Bruhl). Kudos to the Russo brothers Joe and Anthony for directing the hostilities for maximum impact and without neglecting character. Their thundering epic is also smart  snappy politically savvy and blessedly fast on its feet a neat trick pulled off by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who have been with the series since 2011s Captain America The First Avenger. Is it hypocritical for a popcorn movie to condemn violence while reveling in it. You bet. Thats kind of rule No. 1 in Hollywood. The third chapter in the Captain America franchise is more like a third Avengers movie with the climactic airport battle pulling out all the stops as both teams -- decked out in their best comic-book drag -- gather on the tarmac to kick ass. Sure its too much and way too familiar. But an emotional subtext bleeds into the kill zone. The conflict between this broken family of Avengers probably wont be resolved till the upcoming two-part Avengers Infinity War which the Russos will also direct. Meanwhile Captain America Civil War brings the fun the fierce and the fireworks. Summer we have liftoff.

But Captain America Civil War does it better Even though Zack Snyder buried brilliant stuff in his moody opus Anthony and Joe Russo maintain their magic touch throughout Civil War without descending into the murky passages we endure as Dawn of Justice drags on. So the difference in tone buoyancy humour intelligence and the use of Russo light v Snyder gloom is staggering. Here are five major ways that Captain America kicks Batman v Supermans superhero butts 1 -- If you do not count Guardians of the Galaxy -- because it remains an eccentric outlier -- Civil War now easily ranks as the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is more focused more logical and less esoteric than Avengers Age of Ultron; it maintains the nuttiness of the first two Iron Man movies (thanks to the droll Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man); it cleverly loops in Ant-Man (Paul Rudd is still hilarious); and it gives Chris Evans the opportunity to enhance Steve Rogers/Captain America evolving him into a more complex morally struggling and interesting leader. Meanwhile Batman v Superman is not even the best movie in the two-title DC Extended Universe That honour belongs to Snyders less ambitious yet more accomplished Man of Steel. 2 -- The plot of Civil War is logical and relevant in todays political climate. With a screenplay credited to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely Civil War pits two factions of the Avengers against one another over the linked issues of accountability and government supervision. Rogers leads the ""we-know-best"" group against Starks ""we-need-limits"" group. When the two factions engage in a brutal battle viewers are as conflicted as the participants. In Batman v Superman our two superheroes are easily manipulated by the villain. Stupidly their battle turns on a single name spoken ""Martha"" Arrrgh 3 -- Performances are consistently bright throughout Civil War whether it is the lead superheroes -- Evans Downey Rudd Scarlett Johansson Anthony Mackie Don Cheadle Elizabeth Olsen Paul Bettany and Jeremy Renner -- or the excellent support ensemble that includes Sebastian Stan reprising his role as the mixed-up Winter Soldier and sublime William Hurt reinventing his character from The Incredible Hulk. Formerly a military man obsessed with the Hulk Hurts Thaddeus (Thunderbolt) Ross is now the U.S. Secretary of State. He provides the gravitas and grace necessary to legitimately hang the Civil War plot on global politics. Meanwhile Batman v Superman suffers inconsistency issues particularly because Ben Affleck is so much better as Bruce Wayne than as the clunky Batman of the superhero battle. Credit where credit is due however because there are great performances too including Jesse Eisenberg as psycho-villain Lex Luthor. 4 -- The visual palette in Civil War is a joy to behold. The Russo Brothers again worked with a creative team led by Canadian cinematographer Trent Opaloch (District 9 Captain America The Winter Soldier) and English composer Henry Jackman (The Winter Soldier). New to the team is production designer Owen Paterson (The Matrix trilogy). Together along with excellent editors sound engineers and costume designers the crew seamlessly create a superhero world that seems both realistic and fantastic. In contrast Batman v Superman features interminable battle scenes in semi-darkness -- and Afflecks reinvented Bat-gear makes him plod along like a RoboCop reject. 5 -- The Russo Brothers introduce new Avengers with an electrifying buzz that makes the expansion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as much fun for us as it obviously was for the actors. Specifically we get the Marvel debuts of Chadwick Boseman (who played Jackie Robinson in 42 and James Brown in Get On Up) and Tom Holland (a 19-year-old Londoner best known for playing Billy Elliot on stage). Boseman is boldly charismatic as TChalla/Black Panther and will have his own Marvel movie in 2018. Holland is amusing as a naive chatterbox version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man a kid who has only had his powers for six months when Tony Stark recruits him for the superhero battle in Civil War. In Batman v Superman new spinoff superheroes are introduced awkwardly in ""found-footage"" videos. So that confirms that Marvel trumps DC big-time this summer Unless of course Suicide Squad reverses the trend in August.

When the lights went down and the storyline kicked in Bruce Wayne would have been nodding in agreement with Tony Stark while Clark Kent would have been thinking I like the way Captain America thinks. As was the case with ""Batman vs. Superman"" theres a major rift between iconic superheroes over ""collateral damage"" i.e. the loss of innocent human lives that occurs during epic battles between the forces of good and evil. ""Captain America Civil War"" is a lighter and much more crowded film with so many superheroes zipping around and exchanging blows that at one point it felt like the Marvel Universe equivalent of one of those music awards show all-star jams where everyone from Paul McCartney to the Weeknd to Taylor Swift to Adele is onstage. And although theres no shortage of dark moments and violent moments with personal tragedy motivating some characters to attempt to maim cripple and kill the overall tone is relatively light (albeit in a PG-13 kind of way). Iron Man and Captain America and the Black Widow and the Scarlet Witch and Falcon and Hawkeye and Ant-Man among others often exchange quips even while in the midst of intense combat sequences. I guess they dont have to worry about saving their breath. Theres a LOT going on in this movie. A lot. Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean ME) lost in the Geek Weeds. They also seem to realize a movie about superheroes can respect the genre while also taking pause once in a while to acknowledge the sheer giddy silliness of the whole endeavor. ""Civil War"" has a number of pop-culture punch lines from a terribly green Spider-Man referencing a movie from the 1980s to Tony Stark referencing a movie from the 1960s to Ant-Man meeting Captain America for the first time and not even trying to contain his fan-boy glee. The internecine conflicts within the core group of Avengers are so entertaining and dramatically rich its a relative letdown when the attention shifts to a generic madman villain (Daniel Bruhl) with a master plan. But even the obligatory master plan turns out to be different than the master plan we expected it to be. The battle lines in ""Civil War"" are drawn after an overseas mission led by Chris Evans Captain America inadvertently causes the death of a number of innocent civilians. Cap and his team including Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are deeply affected by the tragedy -- but they still firmly believe theyre saving far more lives than could be lost during their takedowns of terrorists. Its horrible and devastating when dozens are killed but isnt that the better choice than hundreds or even thousands falling at the hands of the evildoers? Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark doesnt agree. World-weary and emotionally exhausted from decades of seeing the carnage caused by weapons of mass destruction -- both the type his company once manufactured and the superhuman kind -- Tony agrees with U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and the leaders of 116 other nations who have drafted a phone-book-thick accord giving the United Nations the power to decide if and when the Avengers will be called into action. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) side with Iron Man but Captain America refuses to sign the accord. Next thing you know Iron Man and Captain America are squaring off and picking teams as if theyre the captains of all-star superhero teams. Iron Man recruits a VERY young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (lets put it this way Marisa Tomei plays kindly ""old"" Aunt May). Captain America counters by adding Paul Rudds Ant-Man to the mix. (""Civil War"" also finds room to introduce Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther who like Tom Hollands Spider-Man will soon have a film of his own.) Even with a running time nearing two and a half hours ""Civil War"" keeps things moving along with a solid balance of character soul-searching and kinetic action sequences. (Some of the early action scenes are a bit TOO frantic with so many jiggling camera moves and insanely rapid quick-cuts one pictures Johansson Downey et al. relaxing in their trailers or dubbing their lines while the stunt doubles and the CGI handle the visuals.) Its nice to see further cracks in Captain Americas Mister Perfecto persona. When Tony Stark/Iron Man says hed like to punch Steve Rogers in the face we can relate. It makes the Cap all the more interesting when the Cap makes some really bad decisions. The wonderful actors reprising their superhero roles are as excellent as youd expect them to be -- although I did feel the mega-talented Downey might be getting just a tad restless inhabiting Tony Stark/Iron Man yet again. Chadwick Boseman makes a strong first impression as Black Panther as does Tom Holland as the latest Spider-Man. Forget the calendar and the spring cold. ""Captain America Civil War"" is a classic example of what the big-ticket summer movie experience is all about. 1/2 Marvel Studios presents a film directed by Anthony amp; Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus amp; Stephen McFeely. Running time 147 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for extended sequences of violence action and mayhem). Opens Friday at local theaters.

"Captain America Civil War review Satisfying superheroism - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Captain America Civil War review Satisfying superheroism Captain America Civil War movie review Marvel Studios Chris Evans Elizabeth Olsen Jeremy Renner Paul Rudd Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan in ""Captain America Civil War."" Chris Evans Elizabeth Olsen Jeremy Renner Paul Rudd Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan in ""Captain America Civil War."" (Marvel Studios) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The solemn wrecking-ball mediocrity that was ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" made either too much or not enough of its key themes collateral damage; vigilante excess and the ethics of peacekeeping through extreme force; and more to the marketing point the bloodsport appeal of should-be crime-fighting allies beating the hell out of each other for what seemed like several days. Those bullet points return to far livelier and more satisfying results in ""Captain America Civil War"" the latest Marvel Studios exercise in ensemble superheroism and the fine art of making big piles of money. Here are the key indicators of this franchise entrys success. One Tone. The directors Joe and Anthony Russo stage shoot and edit their action in ways I dont always love but really do admire. When the Avengers pre-breakup take on their new adversaries led by a sinister and plausibly motivated Daniel Bruhl the individual beats amid the beat-downs resemble superhero action sequences from another decade at eight times ""normal"" speed.  It sounds cheesy and exhausting and parts of the movie certainly are that. But the best of ""Civil War"" is heightened and comic-bookish enough to work in the preferred Marvel mode of realistic fakery. RELATED MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR ""Civil War"" comes from screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. They worked on the first ""Captain America"" as well as the second one ""Winter Soldier."" The former was relatively light sprightly old-fashioned; ""Winter Soldier"" dealt in the more profitable and fashionable realms of gargantuan suffering and threats of the apocalypse goosed by a frenzied hand-held camera attack. The new ""Civil War"" more or less combines the traits of the earlier two and the mixture of tones the grimness and the levity duking it out actually comes out about right. Two  Safety in numbers. Early in ""Civil War"" a botched Avengers antiterrorist mission in Nigeria leads to many civilian casualties echoing the collateral damage inflicted at the climax of ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" Should the Avengers be reined in and subjected to stronger federal oversight?Among the gang some vote yes including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); War Machine (Don Cheadle); and the humanoid red man Vision (Paul Bettany who sounds like hes president of the local HAL-9000 impersonators club). Others notably Captain America (Chris Evans) refuse to sign the necessary papers requiring the Avengers to comply with United Nations oversight. This causes a rift and leads rather neatly to the internal strife and intramural civil war of the title a showdown at the Leipzig/Halle airport.When I say the gangs all here I mean the gangs all here. Many ""Avengers"" universe regulars suit up among them Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Falcon (Anthony Mackie) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner looking surly and inconvenienced as usual) Scarlet ""Finger Flames"" Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd; more on him in a sec). Captain America Civil War trailer features first look at Spider-Man The new trailer for ""Captain America Civil War"" features the first look at the new Spider-Man. The new trailer for ""Captain America Civil War"" features the first look at the new Spider-Man. See more videos No Thor no Hulk. But we are treated to some franchise newbies to Captain Americas world chiefly Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman terrific) and the screens newest version of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). As the various superheroes learn what its like to be pummeled and one-upped by their colleagues the scene builds momentum and piles up wreckage without losing its sense of humor. This brings us to ...Three Wit.  ""Civil War"" actually has it. Just about everyone on screen here with the perpetual exception of Evans stalwart and vaguely synthetic Captain America knows how to extract the wit in their material. For a couple of movies now Downey Jr. has been working on autopilot as Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Here the character goes through another of his trademark soul-searches but this time Downey Jr. seems to mean it. He invests in the dramatic bits enough so that we can fully enjoy the movies crucial change-of-pace sequence around the midpoint the meeting between Iron Man and Spider-Man wherein Stark makes derisive note of Spideys ""onesie"" and the two actors clearly are out for comic blood. Its delightful.Nothing in ""Civil War"" takes your breath away. All the exteriors are shrouded in the same overcast indistinct light. Little in story terms is what youd call daisy fresh. But almost everything in it works on its own prescribed terms and the quiet moments register.  Its telling I think that for all the epic scowly intensity on screen in ""Civil War"" the moment that got the spontaneous applause at the Monday night Navy Pier IMAX screening belonged to Rudds Ant-Man and a sudden transformation followed by a swell reaction shot proving that its always a plus to be able to see an actors eyes. Rudds Ant-Man is my kind of underdog in this universe happy and a little bit stunned to be called up to the majors.

Yet his very lack of embarrassment is what makes him so shiny and wonderful and his spirit sets the tone for Captain America Civil War. Its that rare superhero movie that doesnt grind you down with nonstop action or worse yet the usual tiresome cavalcade of smart-ass wisecracks. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have reassembled essentially the same cast from Joss Whedons leaden 2015 Avengers Age of Ultron including Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow who thankfully has more than six lines this time around and Robert Downey Jr. who dials down his high-strung Tony Stark/Iron Man shtick to bearable levels. Overall the movie around them is smarter and more intimate. What do superheroes talk about when were not around? The dialogue here gives us some idea Its Paul Bettanys gallant solar-powered Vision attempting to cook a meal for Elizabeth Olsens soulful but stubborn Scarlet Witch under house arrest for possible misuse of her fire-starting powers. This is an act of selfless romantic daring considering hes never even eaten before. Civil Wars plot is more of the usual The Avengers must work together to vanquish evil yet their petty disagreements divide them. Well of course they do And as in the recent Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice this superhero supergang has been supershamed by the fact that too many innocent civilians tend to be killed while theyre doing the business of dispatching baddies. (At the beginning of Civil War its Olsens Scarlet Witch who commits a particularly glaring transgression--she registers the horror of what shes done with a kind of anguished matter-of-factness a recognition that shell have to live with the consequences for the rest of her days.) Just why are superhero movies only just now cottoning to how many random humans are killed or injured while their protagonists are reducing skyscrapers to rubble or making smoldering scrapheaps out of giant mechanical villains? This carte-blanche carnage has been happening for years now especially given how elaborate special effects have become; until recently it seems weve just been expected to look the other way muttering something about the greater good. Now superhero guilt and culpability are major plot points though its hard to say if its a way of making these characters richer and more complex or simply of justifying bigger more elaborate destructo-fests as long as theyre accompanied by some token handwringing afterward. Still in Civil War regret feels like progress a hook of feeling for the actors to grab onto (and not just an excuse for a sodden gloominess a la Batman v Superman). Like all modern superhero movies even this relatively restrained one is still bigger and louder than it needs to be and its overstuffed with action sequences. But the Russos add enough witty touches to prevent complete brain shutdown Theres Sebastian Stans beefy bipolar Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier handily mounting a spinning motorcycle hes just grabbed out of the air and the vision of one superhero (whose identity shall not be revealed by order of the spoiler police) standing so tall and mighty above the rest that he could be a Ray Harryhausen stop-motion giant--its a computer-generated effect that still somehow retains enough awkwardness to look endearingly handmade. Yet Captain America is most enjoyable for its quieter moments and for its more intimate special effects like Scarlet Witchs ability to make tiny tongues of flame leap from fingertip to fingertip or even just the way Evanss Captain America frozen in the 40s only to be thawed in a strange modern world always looks a little dreamily out of place as if hed really prefer to be listening to Sinatra. And theres a superb new addition Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther an African prince turned enigmatic crimefighter. As both man and cat hes patrician and polished a touch of class padding quietly onto the scene. Like him Civil War at its best is blessedly light on its superhero-booted feet.

With a few blessed exceptions--Tom Hiddlestons arrogant trickster god Loki; the ex-boyfriend-from-hell played by David Tennant on Jessica Jones--its bad guys arent half as interesting as its good guys. Thats true mostly of the sneering Machiavellian schemer Daniel Bruhl portrays in Captain America Civil War whos about as unmemorable as the usual intergalactic conqueror or corporate scumbag making life tough for Earths mightiest heroes. But the films hook its big conceptual draw is that it doesnt really need a heavy at all In this long but brightly entertaining return trip to the ever-expanding MCU star-spangled do-gooder Captain America (Chris Evans) and playboy flyboy Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) find themselves on opposite sides of a conflict their typically testy rapport flowering into a full-on showdown. The studio solves its villain problem by basically removing the villain from the equation.Thats an old comic-book trick pitting the superheroes against each other and Civil War draws a battle line down Marvels whole roster dividing the extended Avengers family into opposing camps. Dont be fooled by the title which tips off a slight allegiance in sympathies more than anything else This is an Avengers movie every bit as densely packed with plot locations costumed characters melodrama screwball comedy and future-sequel groundwork as last summers Age Of Ultron. That Civil War doesnt collapse under the weight of its various moving parts that it manages to be the most serious entry yet in this franchise of franchises without sacrificing much in the way of valuable comic relief is a testament to the creative mojo of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Theyre as close to a dream team as Marvels got and as in the last Captain America movie the propulsive conspiracy thriller The Winter Soldier they wring plenty of thrills and grace notes from company mandate.Though the basic plot outline comes from a decade-old crossover comic-book event Civil War is more like the summation of its dozen big-screen predecessors building the titular title match from the wreckage of several consecutive city-destroying climaxes and the seeds of friendly-fire antagonism first planted in The Avengers. As in this years other superhero grudge match collateral damage is the catalyst After an opening standoff with mercenaries adds another few names to the body count the Secretary Of State (William Hurt) calls for some oversight demanding that the Avengers submit to the authority of the United Nations. Haunted by guilt (and the breakup blues) Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man proves amenable to the sanctions. But Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America wants to stay independent fearful as he is that politics will begin to muddy the ethics of the crime-fighting business. Things get personal after a terrorist attack puts Caps brainwashed ally Bucky (Sebastian Stan) a.k.a the Winter Soldier in the line of fire and suddenly half the team is chasing the other half across the globe. Its a bit like The Fugitive if Harrison Ford had super-powered backup and the man with one arm was the one trying to prove his innocence.Directing episodes of Arrested Development and Community might seem like odd qualifications for a tenure in tentpole mythmaking but orchestrating the comic chaos of those seminal sitcoms has made the Russos old pros at ensemble multitasking. Civil War somehow does right by all its bickering attractions from airborne sidekicks the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) to steely old allies Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to the most magical members of the team Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) who bond during a faintly romantic dinner for two. The filmmakers assume a total audience familiarity with these figures most of whom are identified only by their civilian names. (Skip last summers Ant-Man? Dont expect the movie to catch you up on what Paul Rudds doing here.) This being a Marvel movie Civil War also shoehorns in a couple of new teammates about as gracefully as possible. It helps that theyre instantly appealing Chadwick Boseman (42 Get On Up) gives the African prince TChalla a.k.a. Black Panther a soulful regal intensity while Tom Holland (The Impossible) redeems the idea of yet another Spider-Man reboot by playing the character as an endearing ball of adolescent energy.Theres obvious political metaphor to all this Avenger-on-Avenger violence the infighting doubling as a crude debate on unilateral action. (Captain America firmly against drone warfare in The Winter Soldier here makes the case that a war on terror may result in occasional civilian casualties--a shift in worldview that might generously be read as a reflection of the countrys own sparring mutating ideologies.) If that seems like pretty heavy thematic material for an all-hands-on-deck superhero jamboree Civil War wears it lightly The film is ambivalent about foreign policy but absolutely staunch in its belief that watching jacked-up titans bound through rush hour traffic is really cool. The action scenes in this movie which blend intelligible CGI wizardry with vehicular mayhem and parkour-inflected fight choreography are generally spectacular. Its clear that the Russos have thought about how each of their numerous players would use their abilities and have carefully staged the various showstoppers--like a brawl that plays out on a stairwell creating multiple planes of blow-by-blow combat--to give everyone their due.That becomes most clear during the movies centerpiece sequence an extended bout of melee mayhem in an abandoned airport thats like a microcosm of everything audiences love about the Avengers movies. As these once (and presumably future) team members tear into each other forgetting to hold back as tempers flare and insults go off like fireworks the film gets closer than any Marvel movie before it to actually capturing the playful free-for-all spirit of its source material. It becomes for these few blissful minutes a true live-action comic book and for once the strategy of endless interlocking spinoffs pays off Its like were seeing the fruit of the entire shared-universe labor a set-piece built on not just the powers but also the personalities established across eight years of serialized storytelling. Civil War wont turn skeptics into true believers; it refines rather than transcends its formula and the ending while admirably suffused for once with personal (rather than global) stakes is too beholden to future franchise plans to go as far as it could and maybe should. But it does prove if Marvel hasnt already that something can be both a load-bearing act of brand extension and a nimble colorful blast of entertainment. Now just imagine if they could cook up a few more quality villains.For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details we cant reveal in this review visit Captain America Civil Wars Spoiler Space.

"Review Intense Captain America Civil War keeps Marvel world going strong - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Intense Captain America Civil War keeps Marvel world going strongBy Tony Hicks thicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 05/03/2016 013611 PM PDTUpdated 05/04/2016 050338 PM PDT The new thing among big-screen superheroes is to air their differences by beating the snot out of each other while the public wrings its collective hands over how much collateral damage these fabulously dressed people cause while fighting supervillains aliens and other assorted monsters.Earlier this year we saw Batman blow a gasket at Superman after the Man of Steel leveled much of Metropolis including Bruce Waynes building.Now we have the world holding The Avengers accountable for their destructive ways in ""Captain America Civil War."" The backlash causes a schism in the gang between those willing to let the United Nations control the superheroes (Team Iron Man) and those who believe that nobody should be in charge of The Avengers except The Avengers themselves (Team Captain America). (L-R) Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye/Clint Barton Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff Chris Evans as Captain America/Steve Rogers and Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes in Marvela s Captain America Civil War. (Marvel) ( Marvel ) I see both sides. Heres whyIve have always wondered what these inflated egomaniacs are thinking when they destroy everything in their path to take out a bad guy. Its like the cops who go screaming down the highway at 110 miles an hour putting others in danger to nab a single speeder. I like that someone is throwing up a stop sign and saying ""Wait a minute who says you guys get to do this to our world?"" Then again if you want a superhero to open up a can of justice on bad guys intent on ending the world understand theyre going to have to demolish some stuff in the process. In any event its a thought-provoking premise that gives the film an extra dimension.Advertisement But the filmmakers dont help by throwing so many superheroes in the mix presumably because Marvel wants to give all of its marketable heroes as much face time as they can get. Sometimes here its nearly impossible to know who is fighting whom. The film opens with the Avengers now led by Captain America after Iron Man takes some personal time again wreaking havoc while chasing baddies. The world has had enough. Various leaders come up with a plan to put The Avengers under the oversight of the United Nations. Captain America (Chris Evans showing some real heart) is absolutely opposed but doesnt offer much resistance -- until his old buddy Bucky (Sebastian Stan) also known as The Winter Soldier returns to seemingly assassinate someone pushing hard for Avengers oversight. While the world chases down Bucky Cap assembles some allies and tries to prove Bucky was framed.Heres where the infighting begins and the ridiculous meter begins to climb. Sometimes you just have to go with it even when 20-30 superheroes (way too many) are destroying an airport while throwing vehicles and one-liners at each other. New heroes are brought into The Avengers mix and confuse things even more though I love the scene where the new Spider-Man (played by 19-year-old Tom Holland) tries keeping Iron Man alter-ego Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) away from his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). (L-R) Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther/TChalla Paul Bettany as Vision Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man/Tony Stark Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff and Don Cheadle as War Machine/James Rhodey in Marvela s Captain America Civil War. (Marvel) ( Marvel ) Its also fun watching Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) receive just as much respect as you would expect from the other Avengers. But it also gets tedious after a awhile as you try to keep track of all the costumed craziness and become numb to the violence (only one superhero gets seriously hurt which is insane considering what theyre doing to each other). The climactic scene when a revelation is made about Tony Starks parents sees Captain America and Iron Man really trying to kill each other and its somewhat hard to watch considering how brutal the former friends get with each other. Its hard to tell in the end how this fractured Avengers team will effect the future movies. But no worries theres still too much material for Marvel to mine and ""Civil War"" is a good jumping off point for more of the new Spider-Man and other stand-alone films. In the race with DC Comics (and its recent poorly reviewed and humorless ""Superman v Batman"" film) Marvel still comes out on top when it comes to fun.

Want to know who wins the epic battle among the Avengers? We all do. Rollicking and action-packed Captain America Civil War (out May 6) is a comic book extravaganza that lives up to the hype. The characters are on point. The plot doesnt require a doctorate degree. At 147 minutes it manages to move (fairly) briskly. Smart humor is peppered throughout. All right lets just spell it out This movie course-corrects nearly everything Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice got wrong. Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) in Marvels Captain America Civil War. Zade Rosenthal..(c) Marvel Perhaps its most impressive accomplishment is that despite a cast full of Marvel favorites Captain America isnt just the title character in name only. Chris Evans decidedly square superhero a former World War II soldier programmed by the government to be an indestructible figure still feels like an outsider even as he dons the red white and blue. Hes also seething that his ol Brooklyn buddy James ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) was brainwashed to be an assassin. The character carries that emotional baggage as the movie lands in Lagos Nigeria -- where he and his cohorts are on a mission to smoke out some guys up to no good. But one mercenarys mere mention of Bucky sends the Captain into a bone-crunching rage. Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) uses her mystical hocus pocus to fly the villain into a building and well this all ends very badly for many innocent civilians. Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) in Marvels Captain America Civil War. Zade Rosenthal..(c) Marvel The secretary of state arrives at the Avengers headquarters with a proposal From now on the U.S. government will call the shots on the superheroes employment. In order to cut down on the global destruction the various caped crusaders will no longer be free to roam the world to unleash their powers. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is on board with the plan because as he puts it ""we need to be put in check."" Steely Natasha Romanov/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) sides with him. But Steve Rogers/Captain America is finished following orders and refuses to sign. A moral disagreement explodes into a bitter feud. And after Bucky is punished for a crime he didnt commit Captain America goes rogue. Sure he has trusty Falcon (Anthony Mackie) as a confidant and Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp) returns to bat her eyes at him but the Captain is essentially alone. Screw the rules and the hyper-verbal Tony Stark -- the vet is determined to hunt down the man responsible for turning Bucky into an evil Winter Soldier. War Machine/James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) in Marvels Captain America Civil War. Film Frame..(c) Marvel Perhaps you wouldnt expect such psychologically loaded drama from a Marvel flick. After all Christopher Nolan isnt in the directors chair and creator Stan Lee makes his requisite cheesy cameo. Putting the characters out of costume for a few key scenes helps the cause. With all the loud bells and whistles in these Avengers movies sometimes we forget that esteemed actors such as Downey Johansson Olsen Mackie Don Cheadle (War Machine) and Paul Bettany (Vision) are driving the story. Maybe someday they can all reunite on screen in a movie under a 100 million budget.  Fans will also get a kick out of watching familiar faces emerge and pick a team. The retired Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) gets drawn back in and promptly joins Caps fight club. Falcon also reins in that pesky outlaw Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile an intriguing new character named Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) unites with Iron Man because he believes Bucky is responsible for his fathers death. And a teenager nearly upstages them all In the most amusing scene Stark shows up in a Queens living room to recruit a wide-eyed web-slinging teen named Peter Parker (Tom Holland). Yeah yeah yeah Yet another Spider-Man is about as necessary as another Kardashian reality show. But in his tiny role Holland is charmingly adorkable. (And as a special bonus Downey gets to share screen time with Marisa Tomeis Aunt May. Assume this is as close as were going to get to a sequel to the underrated 1994 rom-com Only You.) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) in Marvels Captain America Civil War. Zade Rosenthal..(c) Marvel Just dont try to make sense of why say Scarlet Witch aligns with Captain America or why Black Widow scraps her alliance with the former soldier and stands by Iron Man. Snappy punchlines asides many of the characters rationales are murky at best. For that matter Iron Man working so closely with the government goes against his rakish devil-may-care M.O. These inconsistent qualities may prove bothersome for comic book aficionados and fans of the franchise. Chris Evans Scares the Crap Out of Avengers Costar Scarlett Johansson Watch The result of all this infighting is a bone-crunching and satisfying war in which every superhero has a moment to shine. (Jokes one ""Everyones got a gimmick now"") Indeed its a remarkable feat that the movie rarely feels overstuffed with characters and plots. Even the chief villain Daniel Bruhls Helmut Zero is quietly thoughtful yet forceful. He could teach Jesse Eisenbergs Lex Luthor a lesson in how to underplay. You dont have to take a side though. Theres no right or wrong or even a lame cop-out ending in which everyone agrees to get along and sing an all-star version of ""Kumbaya."" Just root for both teams and enjoy. Cant get enough of Us?

Deferred Action at Dallas Wyly Theatre seems ripped from headlines Article Tweet Loading ... Karen Almond Karen Almond Deferred Action Through May 14 ATamp;T Performing Arts Centers Wyly Theatre 2400 Flora St. Dallas 18-99 214-880-0202; www.dallastheatercenter.org By Mark LowrySpecial to DFW.comPosted 424pm on Wednesday May. 04 2016 Wednesday May. 04 2016 Thursday May. 05 2016 By Mark Lowry DALLAS In recent years it has been widely noted that political satire via fake news online and on TV is more difficult to convey because the real headlines coming out of Washington D.C. the state capitals and on the campaign trail have become increasingly and head-shakingly unreal. Deferred Action a world premiere co-production about immigration between Dallas Theater Center and Chicano group Cara Mia Theatre Company now playing at the Wyly Theatre in Dallas isnt striving for satire -- its very much taken from interviews with real people and todays headlines -- but its easy to see where the two politicians in the story are composites that are not cartoonish. Real life has truly become stranger than fiction.The play is wackiest in the final scene which sets up a continuing story. That makes sense because Deferred Action is the second in a trilogy about immigration. The first was The Dreamers A Bloodline which Cara Mia premiered in 2013 at the Latino Cultural Center in Dallas. It was written by David Lozano and the company and was a harrowing violent drama about women making the dangerous trek from El Salvador to Texas with their young children. Deferred set in a North Texas city in primary season was co-written by Lozano and DTCs Lee Trull and directed by Lozano. It focuses on Javi who was one of those kids who made it to America and is now a young man played by Cara Mia company member Ivan Jasso.Hes a Dreamer -- he wasnt born here has excellent grades and has been living in constant fear of deportation even after President Obamas executive action in 2014. He was raised by Abue (Frida Espinosa-Muller) and is engaged to Lisa (Elizabeth Ramos) who works for Nancy (Christie Vela) a Mexican-American congresswoman with big political aspirations. Rodney Garza is immigration attorney Carrasquillo and Stephanie Cleghorn Jasso plays Javis friend Ximena.When Javi and his friend Robby (Arturo Soria) are stopped for speeding Robby records the conversation between Javi and a white cop. The video goes viral and Javi is thrust into the heated immigration debate between Nancy and Dale Jenkins (Michael Brusasco) a Tea Party politician.Over a series of short scenes (more than 30 of them) Lozano and Trull balance the hot-button and passionate debate between the Latino characters and the politicians with documentarian flair. They poetically use flashbacks to the baby Javis difficult journey from Central America adding context for those who havent seen the first installment. There is some family melodrama but the writers focus on the big issue through some surprising and funny plot twists. If you think this is going to be a left-leaning lambast of the anti-immigration stance that has become even bigger with Donald Trumps wall promises youll be surprised.The work has been in development for years but it was most molded by the fact that immigration reform has not passed on either side of the aisle. Still Deferred Action makes a compelling case via Javi -- whos considered perfect for the debate because hes ""clean-cut"" -- for America being a harbor for the tired weary and huddled masses yearning to break free.With the exception of Soria Ramos and Brusasco the cast is split between DTC and CMTC company members with most of them playing multiple characters. Epsinosa-Muller continues her streak of great performances as Abue and the role of Javi is perfect for Jasso a compelling leading man with depth.The role of Dale was conceived by DTC company member Steven Michael Walters but it might as well have been written for Brusasco terrific as one of those politicians you cant stop watching even as the latest train wreck that comes out of his mouth is bigger than the previous one. Timothy R. Mackabees set of massive panels at the back and sides of the proscenium configuration evokes a totalitarian interrogation room with entryways -- and perhaps Trumps wall.It remains to be seen if the third installment will have DTC involvement or go back to being a Cara Mia project but Deferred Action definitely creates interest for it.

Everybody wins in Captain America Civil War (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Everybody wins in Captain America Civil War (PG-13) The showdown between Marvel Comics beloved superheroes exceeds expectations. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/3/2016 Editor rating 3.5 Captain America Civil War is an intimate epic a giant-sized comic-book movie in which people not superheroes steal the show. This is the biggest Marvel Studios film to date -- the story plays out on a global scale and the main cast reaches double digits -- but many of its best moments are small throwaway beats Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) who is cramped in the back of a small car asking a surly Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to move his seat up; a starstruck Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) so giddy about meeting Captain America (Chris Evans) he practically asks for a selfie; Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) teaching the synthetic Vision (Paul Bettany) how to properly use paprika in a recipe; Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) casually flirting with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) to the alarm of her nephew Peter Parker (Tom Holland).Yes Spider-Man plays an important role in Civil War and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) the African prince out to avenge the death of his father is even more critical to the story They havent been thrown in just to set up future franchises. Civil War expands the already daunting Marvel Cinematic Universe but this nimble film has been so well thought-out and constructed so skillfully orchestrated and shot it never feels overstuffed. The two-and-a-half hours fly by. Filmmaking brothers Anthony and Joe Russo manage to do what Joss Whedon only achieved sporadically in his two Avengers pictures They groove on the pleasures of a large ensemble that has been developed over the course of 12 previous movies. The whole of Civil War is as much fun as the scene in Age of Ultron in which everyone took turns trying to lift Thors hammer. The difference is that the characters arent just killing time between big action setpieces. This time the heroes are the main show at odds over  an accord requiring them to act under the supervision of the United Nations in order to cut down on collateral damage. Iron Man thinks this is a good idea. Captain America does not. The escalation builds slowly a disagreement between friends that grows in gravity and consequence.Borrowing the central premise (but fortunately little else) from the seven-issue series written by Mark Millar in 2006 Civil War ponders the issue of causality As the number of superpowered beings fighting for good grows will an equal number of supervillains rise up? There is a traditional bad guy in Civil War -- Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) -- but he has no special powers or big beams of destructive light. The script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely teases out his scheme as a mystery We dont understand what hes doing or why until the film is almost over. His evil plan consists of behind-the-scenes manipulation. Hes a stealth baddie Iago instead of Thanos or Loki without his sceptre.This is a bold move for a superhero movie because such films are often defined by their villains (the more daunting the better). But Captain America Civil War isnt like most superhero movies. The Marvel films are about to get nuttier as the ramp-up to the climactic Infinity War begins and Civil War feels like the Russos wanted to hit pause and bring the story back down to a recognizable reality before the action goes cosmic. The movie is deliberately paced picking up speed as it goes and it contains some sensational action setpieces including a big brawl on an airport tarmac in which everybody fights everybody (the showdown exceeds your expectations) and a furious car-motorcycle chase in which the CGI trickery is so invisible the scene feels old-school like something out of The French Connection.The big finale in Civil War however involves only a couple of characters -- again the movie goes refreshingly small -- and the life-and-death stakes are grave because the film has done such a good job of stressing these (mostly) ordinary people instead of their suits. After the nihilistic deconstruction of Deadpool and the flattening self-importance of Batman v. Superman Captain America Civil War reminds you how funny and exciting these pictures can be when theyre done right -- you know like comic books. The summer movie season has barely begun and already the remedy for superhero film fatigue has arrived.

In theaters May 6. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The Avengers split into two warring superhero factionsCAST Chris Evans Robert Downey Jr. Sebastian Stan Scarlett JohanssonRATING PG-13 (Strong action-violence mild language)LENGTH 227BOTTOM LINE Another slick product from the Disney-Marvel machine Near the beginning of ""Captain America Civil War"" the superheroes known as The Avengers sit for a tongue-lashing by Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross. Hes angry about the major cities the crew has destroyed in various movies including New York City; Washington D.C.; some place called Sokovia; and now Lagos Nigeria. Ross played by William Hurt in a stern suit wants to rein in the Avengers. ""For the past four years"" he fumes ""youve operated with unlimited power and no supervision"" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? You could say the same about Disney-Marvel the studio team that formed in 2009 and has been laying waste to the box office ever since. In ""Captain America Civil War"" the title hero and his friends are accused of being arrogant and domineering. Audiences might feel the same about these movies some day -- but only when they stop being entertaining. That point hasnt arrived quite yet. The third ""Captain America"" film entertains relentlessly which is to say loudly and busily but with enough humor and intelligence to make it seem less pandering than it actually is. Its central theme of unchecked power has a topical resonance in a post-Snowden era but of course thats hardly the point. ""Civil War"" is here to provide explosions stunts big-budget effects and the answer to such burning questions as Who would win in a fight -- Captain America (Chris Evans) or Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.)? Movies25 big movies out this summer After the Avengers split into two camps -- with Iron Man uncharacteristically bowing to the authorities while the Captain refuses -- well watch an enjoyable free-for-all involving Scarlett Johanssons athletic Black Widow Paul Bettanys godlike Vision and many many more. advertisement | advertise on newsday Neither The Hulk nor Thor show up but hey theres Paul Rudd as the jocular Ant-Man And newcomer Chadwick Boseman (""42"") as the cult favorite Black Panther And Tom Holland as the very newest Spider-Man (hes young and slightly fidgety) Lurking behind the chaos is Daniel Bruhl as Zemo whose nefarious plans include the Captains old frenemy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Directed with all the requisite bombast by Anthony and Joe Russo from a crammed but fast-paced screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely ""Captain America Civil War"" is a well-built machine that performs its function perfectly. In other words the domination continues.

Superheroes get in a super feud and the movie is collateral damage. Directors Anthony Russo Joe Russo. (227) PG-13 Violence strong language. Area theaters. Sometimes more is less. Although its called ""Captain America Civil War"" the latest Marvel movie is actually a supersized ""Avengers"" picture -- overstuffed to bursting. And sometimes during its two and a half hour running time it just goes bust. An epic sequel to both ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" and ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" the story picks up after our costumed vigilantes have wrecked yet another city this time in Nigeria. And by now people have started to get sick of it. RELATED INSIDE THE MAKING OF CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR Governments across the world feel its time these superhero rogues got licensed supervised controlled. From l. Falcon/Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) Ant-Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) (Marvel / Disney) Surprisingly its an idea that appeals to bad-attitude billionaire Iron Man. It is one however that straight-arrow soldier Captain America rejects. And the stage for that titular ""Civil War"" is set. But the set itself is overcrowded. RELATED MEET MARVELS NEWEST HEROES Bragging just a bit - see how many franchise characters weve got DC? - Marvel practically doubles the number of superheroes for this movie. And its too much. The sky is crowded with super heroes in Captain America Civil War. (Marvel / Disney) Sure its great to see Cap Iron Man and Black Widow again. And true Thor and the Hulk happen to be sitting this one out (and theyre missed). But do we really need Falcon and Hawkeye and War Machine Ant-Man and Vision and Scarlet Witch taking sides? And new additions Spider-Man and Black Panther too? The excess means that theres less time for the humanity and humor were used to in Marvel movies and more time clogged with explosions and fistfights. The Russo brothers sure direct everything as fast and furiously as they can. KUNTZMAN CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR REVEALS A GLOBAL DANGER Thats fine to a point. You dont want to put Scarlett Johansson in tight pants and black boots and not have her kick butt. But a battle at an airport seems to go on forever. A car chase doesnt get to any meaningful destination. And as long as the movie is it still manages to leave the story unresolved with the threat of another installment just to wrap things up. Give the film points for paying a little attention to serious themes like vengeance and the consequences of violence. And although theyre dragged into the plot the debuts of both Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man hint at better things (and films) to come. But as many millions of dollars as this is going to make it could have been a lot more Marvelous if it had only been trimmed down a bit. Really couldnt the filmmakers have taken a cue from Ant-Man and made a smaller tighter film?

Photo Courtesy of Marvel Given the relative dullness of the Marvel supervillains the studio has resorted to making its colorful superheroes fight one another in Captain America Civil War a combination jamboree and ethical colloquium. Theres a lot of bloat but the fanboy in us all will have a hard time not grinning when Spider-Man be-webs Captain Americas shield while Ant-Man scoots around pulling out wires in Iron Mans suit. But theres a lot of bloat. The film pivots on citizens enraged by collateral damage because it turns out that when superheroes throw supervillains into sides of buildings many people in those buildings die. That danger hadnt occurred to me frankly insofar as superheroes dont really exist -- so who needs pesky real-world consequences? But 9/11 has sensitized us to the horror of collapsing skyscrapers (Americans were the last to get the news) while modern comics writers (along with directors Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder) have earnestly taken up the ethics of vigilantism. Snyders Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice opens with Bruce Wayne/Batman watching Superman and General Zod pulverize Metropolis and blaming (inexplicably given his own leanings) the savior rather than the psycho. Our heroes here are similarly pilloried. More than pilloried. The secretary of State (William Hurt) lectures the chastened Avengers for aroutinely ignor[ing] sovereign bordersa and being aunconcerneda about the hell they leave behind. The United Nations wants them to sign a treaty promising not to fly around smashing invaders willy-nilly. Robert Downey Jr.as Tony Stark/Iron Man thinks this is a good thing and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) thinks itas not. Iad guessed the high-tech Stark would be the one to opt for security over accountability but early on heas schooled by Alfre Woodard as a mother whose son died in the last Avengers film. Captain A on the other hand consoles a guilt-ridden Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) on the inevitable trade-off aThis job is trying to save as many people as we cana he says. aNot all of them.a The script puts us on Capas side Safety first. It even features a cute drone. The politics do get muddled in the end -- but whos lining up for the clunky debates? Captain America Civil War turns on another of those momentous questions Who would win in a fight -- Batman or Superman? King Kong or Godzilla? Tyrannosaurus Trump or Robo-Hillary? And so Scarlet Witch Falcon (Anthony Mackie) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the newly enlisted Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) line up behind Captain A while War Machine (Don Cheadle) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Vision (Paul Bettany) side with Iron Man. Spider-Man (Tom Holland) pops up too. Superheroes can take a lot of punishment and the results are predictably inconclusive. But ... you know Iron Man zapping Captain America bonking Iron Man getting electro-fogged by Scarlet Witch getting kung fu-ed by Black Widow -- how cool is that? Its too bad Hulk and Thor were otherwise engaged and Samuel L. Jackson likely cost too much even for a budget this gargantuan. But there are wild cards among them Caps old pal turned nemesis Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and the African president who moonlights as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and thinks the Winter Soldier killed his dad. On another front an enigmatic Daniel Bruhl slays former hydra officials in a quest to locate a bunch more bio-enhanced Winter Soldiers in stasis somewhere in the former Soviet Union. Its a busy busy movie. But not an especially inventive one. Say what you will about Zack Snyder he aims for a mythic palette mixing Expressionistic silent-film imagery with art-museum-worthy religious iconography. Overseen by ex-sitcom directors Anthony and Joe Russo Captain America Civil War is a hodgepodge with action sequences handled by sundry effects factories working in sundry styles. The most rousing set piece is the very first a hyperspeed fight between terrorists and a handful of Avengers thats noticeably rotoscoped the slight flicker making the real bodies and computer-generated mayhem seem all of a piece -- and brilliantly punctuated by the Captains pinging shield and the elastic gymnastics of Johansson and her stunt double. How many gag writers supplied one-liners? I especially liked the bit in the car where the Winter Soldier asks the cranky Falcon to move up his seat. Holland shows promise as the new unusually juvenile Spidey a chatterbox full of hormones and grooving on his power. Martin Freeman has a brief but amusingly creepy part as a CIA liaison whos a little too happy doing his job. Olsen can suffer without being a drip -- her mask of grief is eloquent. The best way to think of Captain America Civil War is as a toy box in which the sheer quantity of toys partly makes up for the lack of anything new. But the big takeaway is worrisome. Marvel has created a universe teeming with superheroes who simply dont have enough to do. Theyre all suited up with nowhere to go. This review originally misidentified the actress Alfre Woodard. We regret the error. This article appears in the May 2 2016 issue of New York Magazine.

While that film was severe and downcast Civil War is expansive at times even light. BvS strove to redefine its superheroes to fit newer darker borderline-sociopathic molds; Civil War finds conflict in its characters more ennobling qualities Captain Americas idealism Iron Mans pragmatism Black Widows resourcefulness. Zack Snyders film was stylized to a fault with its slo-mo shots and pirouetting camera moves; the Russo Brothers is functional un-showy -- maybe even a little drab. Batman v Superman was larded with ominous aphorisms and loaded dialogue about power and humanity and guilt and loyalty and duty; Civil War is...well OK its got a ton of those too.The story feels similar as well. After a big fight in Lagos leaves civilians dead the Avengers are left to mull the consequences and collateral damage of their world-saving. Tony Stark a/k/a Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) confronted by a mother who lost her son during the events of Avengers Age of Ultron tries to get his superhero cohort to join him in signing the Sokovia Accords which will bring our heroes under the control of an outside governing body. Steve Rogers a/k/a Captain America (Chris Evans) an earnest believer in American individualism and liberty bristles at the idea. The heroes start to take sides -- Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) cast their lot with Iron Man while Falcon (Anthony Mackie) goes with Captain America.Film Details Captain America Civil War RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time146 min. More Info Trailer EXPAND Courtesy Marvel The situation becomes more personal with the bombing of the ceremonial signing of those accords. The culprit appears to be the Winter Soldier a/k/a Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) who was Steve Rogerss best friend back in the 1940s but was revealed in the last Captain America movie to be a brainwashed super-soldier working for the bad guys. But the Winter Soldier had started to regain his identity by the finale of that film and Cap isnt convinced his bud Bucky would do something like this -- and Bucky claims innocence. The bombing also kills the king of the small African nation of Wakanda prompting a vow of revenge from his son TChalla a/k/a Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Cap believes his pal Iron Man believes the government Black Panther doesnt believe anybody and as other heroes join in the fight (most notably Paul Rudds Ant-Man and newly christened Spider-Man Tom Holland) the movie becomes Avengers 3 Avengers v. Avengers.Civil War treats the idea of internecine superhero combat as some kind of amazing novelty when in fact thats what they do in so many of the other movies too. (Remember Hulk v. Thor in Avengers? Ant-Man v. Falcon in Ant-Man?) Still the climactic battle in Leipzig Airport is Civil Wars high point fast inventive and funny. It also finds suspense and even some pathos in the idea of superhumans pulling their punches; theyre explicitly trying not to kill each other and it turns out thats sort of hard. That airport face-off also highlights the films most compelling elements the newer heroes Black Panther with his drive for revenge; Spider-Man with his eager-beaver witticisms; Ant-Man with his aw-shucks ordinariness; Falcon with his jaded sarcasm. At times I wondered if Civil War might have worked better if it had played out strictly from the perspective of one of them. EXPAND Courtesy Marvel But Marvels schedule calls for a Captain America movie this one about the collective guilt of the Avengers across all the earlier films. Maybe thats the problem here For these characters this sense of responsibility for the consequences of their actions feels both overdue and out of place. The filmmakers want to bring these costumed fictions into the real world...but its all happening in a universe thats already too invested in the supernatural and the galactic. This is where style might have helped. While the ornate overbearing aestheticism of Batman v Superman was maybe too much superhero movies should have visual panache some sense of otherworldly wonder.Winter Soldier also directed by the Russo Brothers managed that by giving us a political thriller that wasnt afraid to escalate into the realm of exotic childhood fantasy -- vast decades-old conspiracies and surreal images of ginormous heli-carriers doing battle in the skies over Washington D.C. In trying to ground its characters in something resembling the ordinary Civil War overcorrects. Gone are the wide-eyed sense of derring-do that characterized the first Captain America movie and the paranoid tension that defined Winter Soldier; there isnt even the slapstick of Ant-Man or the witty abandon of the better Iron Mans.But we watch anyway. Why? Im not sure. Call it the confident caress of corporate continuity. Its odd to think that a generation of viewers may not remember a time when interlocking superhero epics didnt command such swaths of the mainstream moviegoing firmament. These films no longer have to delight and surprise us; no their job now is to manage the brand not screw anything up too royally and keep us hooked for the next installment. Civil War pulls all that off mostly well. It skips all around the world (Siberia Nigeria Vienna London Leipzig Queens) anxiously maneuvering plot points into place and audiences know to trust that itll all add up to something because these things usually do. But I never found myself genuinely wondering what was going to happen next; the moves are too familiar. Even the big fight entertaining as it is feels like its there not because of dramatic inevitability but because somebody behind a desk decided it had to be. Its just a bunch of stuff.

More so than any of the previous episodes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ""Civil War"" is a soap opera in spandex. In part thats because of the films refreshing (if not fully realized) emphasis on emotional turmoil rather than global destruction; while plenty of buildings blow up most of the collateral damage is caused by the good guys as they argue with each other and threaten to go their separate ways. This isnt just about killing time before the Infinity Wars its about fulfilling the ultimate goal of the MCU A film franchise so immense and self-perpetuating that a plots greatest possible conflict is no longer the end of the world but rather the end of the brand. The story begins as most Marvel movies do wherever the hell it wants. The profound sense of guilt that began to fester inside Tony Stark (still Robert Downey Jr.) after the attacks on New York City has been intensified by the death toll from the fight against Ultron in Sokovia. And Stark isnt the only one whos afraid to look in the mirror. Early in the film Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) is devastated when a brawl in Lagos claims a handful of innocent bystanders. With various world governments on edge about the continued existence of the Avengers -- whose formation seems to have invited a never-ending series of calamities upon the Earth --  U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) draws up the Sokovia Accords which would essentially put the superhero task force under the command of the United Nations. Stark an Oppenheimer type whos desperate to share the burden of guilt is ready to sign. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) a product of WWII who believes that the Avengers are capable of policing the planet on their own is not. Stark thinks that they need regulations; Rogers thinks that they are the regulations. While the MCU is largely inspired by story arcs that were drawn long before the 21st Century these movies have nevertheless used 9/11 as their north star and ""Civil War"" is a natural choice of narratives for a saga thats so preoccupied with the United States evolving role on the world stage. The philosophical differences between the two Avengers are enflamed when a bomb detonates during the signing of the Accords killing the king of Wakanda (a fictional African nation). All signs point to Bucky Barnes as the culprit but Rogers refuses to believe that his old pal is capable of such evil. The villain is clear from the start and hes far more innocuous than you might think. In fact for the first time in a Marvel movie the main antagonist is just some dude. Sure hes hatched from comic book mythos but he doesnt have a super-suit or electric whips or a menacing red face -- his name is Helmut Zemo and hes pretty much just Daniel Bruhl. Zemos most ominous characteristics are his German accent and his penchant for eating bacon -- and only bacon -- for breakfast. He could just as easily be the villain from a mid-90s thriller starring Clint Eastwood. His scheme is to agitate the Avengers into fighting each other and it works. Stomping on the carcass of its competition can only get a film so far but it goes without saying that the rift between these two superheroes is considerably more nuanced and better-developed than that between Batman and Superman. Iron Man and Captain America have some serious shit to work out and their disagreements arent resolved out of convenience or in order to rally together against a common foe. In fact the Russo brothers are so invested in the ideas that bond their characters together (and tear them apart) that Zemo becomes an afterthought the most forgettable villain in a franchise whose antagonists include Dark Elves and several different bald white men. What makes ""Civil War"" so emblematic of the MCU is that it cuts to the heart of what the brand is all about humanity. ""Spider-Man 2"" predates the dawn of the MCU but these movies have never forgotten that films bittersweet parting thought Compassion is both our greatest strength and our greatest liability. On the flip-side of that coin ideology is the MCUs most consistent foil (hence the series dramatically stultifying preoccupation with mind-control which reaches a painful nadir in ""Civil War"").  The tension between the potential generosity of strength and the corruptive nature of power also explains why so many of the jokes in these movies -- and almost all of the unfunny ones in ""Civil War"" -- boil down to ""Superheroes theyre just like us"" So far as Marvel is concerned they are and always will be. Rogers and Stark are two sticks of old dynamite wrapped around a single fuse and all Zemo has to do is light a match. He recognizes that the Avengers individual guilt is pushing them towards the blind comforts of ideology just as he recognizes that ideology never leaves much wiggle room. As Rogers puts it ""Compromise where you can. And where you cant dont."" ""Civil War"" bursting with fun characters and drawing from a rich mythology is also the most convincing proof yet that the MCU can compromise just about everywhere. For Marvel a studio that essentially uses the same score on every movie and fired Edgar Wright from ""Ant-Man"" because his creative vision deviated from party lines compromise has become an aesthetic unto itself. Thats never been more evident than it is in ""Civil War"" especially during the fight scenes. Marvel has always excelled at expressing character through action and so it stands to reason that the characters suffer if the action becomes less expressive. The combat in ""Civil War"" is so clumsy that it actually undercuts the drama. The justification behind many of the films tiffs are hard to believe as it is but only when the characters actually drop the gloves does it get hard to remember why theyre fighting. Watching ""Civil War"" its easy to understand why the MCU is so hung up on the fight in New York -- its the franchises only great action sequence. Joss Whedons visceral understanding of cinematic geometry and his symphonic flair for choreographing movement allowed that marquee set-piece to galvanize the separate threads of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into a unified whole. On the contrary every action beat in ""Civil War"" is such a discrete hodgepodge of close-ups and medium shots that they might as well exist in a vacuum -- at times this feels like the first movie ever made entirely out of gifs. The problem becomes gallingly clear during a battle royale in which more than a dozen different superheroes square off on an airport tarmac. Not only does the flabbergasting lack of wide shots completely diminish the scale of the fight -- its like the Russo brothers forgot half of their lenses at homes -- but it also limits the action to one plane at a time. It doesnt help that the factions feel so arbitrarily determined. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) gets to have a handful of great moments but not even he seems to know why hes trying to make life difficult for Tony Stark. On the other hand it makes perfect sense that teenage Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is so endearingly overeager just to be there. But the Russo brothers cant juggle two slivers of parallel action -- 100% of their attention is focused on the foreground at all times -- let alone smoothly re-introduce an iconic Marvel character in the middle of a massive brawl. Hollands precocious zip makes him a wonderful Spidey just as Chadwick Bosemans stoic strength suggests that his Black Panther will have no trouble carrying his own movie but just because these new characters feel right in this world doesnt mean that theyre provided a proper place in this movie. When the action cuts to either one of them Captain America and Iron Man suddenly feel a million miles away and ""Civil War"" dissolves into nothing more than an advertisement for the MCUs next round of spin-offs. Theres no room for context in these shots just bodies. Its hard to believe that Tony Stark is being eaten up by something that happened in a different movie if you cant connect two things that happen in the same scene. Its all just empty talk and ""Civil War"" becomes a civic lesson thats punctuated by one-liners and explosions. The bigger these movies become the smaller they feel. The more aggressively they reach for greatness the more clearly they prove that its beyond their grasp. Marvel movies dont get much better than this. The trouble is they dont want to.

This just further proves why we desperately need the DCEU. BvS was a great start. The world and by world I mean critics and trolls just werent ready for great movie that isnt part of the MCU. All in all Im happy were getting so many CBMs. Reply Jack April 27 2016 535 pm I thought the movie was great and something different to the previous ones. It was smaller in scale but more about the characters. That airport scene will go down as one of the greatest comicbook scenes ever i dont know if we were watching the same scene. It isnt easy to juggle that many characters in a fight scene but the russos did it well. Much better than Avengers 2 which i found pretty boring. Reply Bran April 27 2016 535 pm Ok that review made me chuckle then the comment from DCGUY23 made me flat out laugh. Moving on Reply Chizz April 27 2016 551 pm Visually the Russo brothers are totally incompetant. Glad this was a major point in the review Reply Bill April 27 2016 555 pm What a troll of a review. Your review doesnt even go into the details of every moranic ideology you spout. Congrats you got the Internets connection. Must be lonely down there Reply coolman April 27 2016 617 pm why does this review count as a positive on rotten tomatoes? its pretty negative so it should by rotten. Reply Joshua Sanders April 27 2016 621 pm WOW how many spoilers? Like it or not dont screw everyone who hasnt seen it yet. Like North America.... Reply Evan April 27 2016 624 pm Bill If you have read David Ehrlichs reviews of Deadpool and other Marvel movies you would know what to expect. Do your research. Nothing he says here prevents you from enjoying the film. Reply Jeff April 27 2016 631 pm DCGUY23 proves that being a fanboy and butthurt are the perfect match. Reply Pencil April 27 2016 645 pm Me personally this was my favourite MCU movie and tbh I think a C grade is down right harsh and not true. This movie will gross bulk cash at the box office regardless and Ill probably be seeing it multiple times. A+ for me. Reply defenderofcinema April 27 2016 710 pm with this and his review of zootopia its clearly transparent that this Ehrlich fellow has a bias against Disney and everything they stand for. Reply Cheez April 27 2016 731 pm I find it laughable that this guy keeps bringing up the first Avengers movie. While the action and the Whedon one liners are great the story is freaking bare bones. The Avengers is probably the most overrated MCU movie just because no one can see beyond Joss Whedon. The Avengers is a collection of comic book inspired moments with winks and nods thrown in. Its the plot of Space Invaders and the first 45 minutes of Armaggedon you know the come together for a cause moment. Reply Robb Ibrahim Stark April 27 2016 746 pm What a rubbish review. It contradicts ALL other reviews and cant accept that it is a killer movie. DCGUY23 needs to wake up and admit man of steel and bvs were just awful and that dc will never be able to replicate Marvels success Reply jed June 4 2016 518 pm Of course you think this review is rubbish because they didnt like the movie. God forbid if someone has a different opinion. Reply fred April 27 2016 834 pm It doesnt get any better than this man whats with the lame grade than? Is a the best you could come up with haha. I havent seen it yet but im just saying if a C is the best grade youve ever given an MCU its pretty clear its just not for you. Reply Lynn April 27 2016 844 pm The Avengers is so overrated. The plot is predictable the dialogue is forced the action is average. Therere at least 6 MCU movies that are better than the Avengers. You sound like a Whedon fanboy and had only watched 3 MCU movies. Civil War is almost as good as Winter soldier Im watching it again this weekend. Reply DKidd April 27 2016 856 pm Chill chaps this reviewer obviously found the need to be the voice of dissent in the resounding chorus of assent for the movie and fanboys like DCGUY23 should just take his own advice stop trolling fanboying and get his own opinion. When a movie has incoherent parts lameass reasons for fighting/stopping the fight and a downright irritating villain of course no one is ready for that kind of movie Reply Orlando April 27 2016 856 pm Haha some of these hating trolls kill me on here. I bet they came directly to this site when they seen this score so they can have something bad or mediocre about this film to latch on too. When you see comments by them down talking a film they have even yet to see I think that tells you all you need to know about them. DCGUY23 - You agree with what have you even seen Civil War yet dog I highly doubt it. Before you decide to rush to judgement and agree with someone watch the film first. Outside of this review and another Ive heard nothing but raves about this film still I dont know yet what to think until I see the film for myself. Reply FuckReviewsLikeThis April 27 2016 912 pm You are just a bunch of haters.Just because DC could not deliver a good movie. You will see how CACW will make at least 2 billion dollars(yeah thats right billion). So shovel this review up your a Reply doodoo April 27 2016 938 pm i like to eat poopoo and peepee Reply Alex April 27 2016 947 pm zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Reply Jay James April 27 2016 1036 pm I dont want to feel like a troll here but seriously give the review why rate this Fresh on Rotten tomatoes? Reply patrick April 27 2016 1049 pm DCGUY23 absolutely hilarious. BVS was literally a terrible movie worse than the worst marvel movie worse than all batmans besides batman and robin. an inane asinine misunderstanding of being dark (dark knight trilogy wasnt good because of the fact that it was dark) snyder needs to get booted from creative control. Reply Rahul April 27 2016 1107 pm Lmao what? This review was hilarious And you had to ruin the perfect scores... Theres always one or two contrary little boys... Reply Alex April 27 2016 1129 pm I saw the movie and the airport scene was maybe the best fight scene Ive seen in any film and according to almost all the other reviews everyone else agrees. What film was this guy watching??? Reply manoj April 27 2016 1139 pm Thanks for the Legit reviews. We need more like this upto the release. Reply watchmoviehd April 27 2016 1147 pm Watch Captain America Civil War Full Movie HD here bit.ly/20250ll Reply JC April 28 2016 1219 am Im a big MCU fan and Ive seen this movie yesterday (April 27 here in Philippines). I was reading a lot of great reviews before watching this film so I was really expecting a lot from this movie. I was very disappointed after watching the film and this review is spot-on. I really love these superheroes but the story made them emotional instead of being smart. I really hated the ""reveal"" towards the end of the movie where Iron Man finds out ""something."" I was like ""Dude try to understand everything before you do stupid things."" This movie lacks sense like why call Spider-man when you can call Fury Hill and other existing SHIELD agents who helped them in Sokovia? Reply Harry April 28 2016 118 am I completely disagree with this review. I cant help thinking if we watched the same movie. But some votes for Trump others for Hillary. We like diffrent stuff. To me this movie is close to be a masterpiece. I think after The Dark Knight this movie is the best Superhero movie ever make. So complex a story with so many charachters and still it seems so simpel. It like listening to a piece of Mozart and thinking this is so simple. But then when you study or try to compose something similar you realize how difficult it is. I respect your point of view - but one fact I do not agree in ""On the contrary every action beat in ""Civil War"" is such a discrete hodgepodge of close-ups and medium shots that they might as well exist in a vacuum"". I suggest you watch it again. I will also watch it again and see if maybe I remember wrong. But I think there were a lot of overview shots and the combat scenes was composed so creatively and smooth. Reply Anushree Sharma April 28 2016 415 am The airport scene is the best in the movie. I guess for you visually it wasnt great because there were no cities getting destroyed. What Marvel has done with Civil War is made it clearthough these are superheroes at the end of the day more human and hence we as an audience can love them. DC on another hand is plain boring. Reply pencilhead April 28 2016 525 am The airport scene is practically getting universal praise as one of the best scenes in superhero cinema and somehow this is a point of contention with this author? HmmOK. Reply Thedarkwolve April 28 2016 601 am I just watched the movie an hour ago and I will say it is really awesome. Other than the slow start and another (somewhat) weak marvel villain I thought the movie was great. The fight scenes were ridiculously well made and all in all the action emotional tension and conflict in this movie is remarkable. Reply hmmm June 11 2016 631 am I actually like that the villain was just some guy. Superheroes tend to be so invincible that the greatest vulnerability they have are emotional/character development conflicts. Kudos for taking a break from introducing an extraterrestrial/magic/super-power-organization villain. Reply hmmm June 11 2016 636 am I am curious if and how a movie with Thanos will be made though. Reply ASE April 28 2016 712 am BS Reply Franchise death monkey April 28 2016 738 am DCGUY23 you are being ironic right? This is Indiewire not Den of geek. Reply John Smith April 28 2016 938 am I went into this movie and i really tried to like it but personally this movie really sucked for me ( i knew from the 1st hour into this film that it was going to have the same affect that age of ultron had and that it was extremely boring / The winter soldier and the first avengers movie are the ones that i have thoroughly enjoyed but i think after having a taste of the darkness and tone that i felt when watching Batman Vs Superman its won it for me anyone else? Reply Internets Opinion Person April 28 2016 953 am While the Russos arent near as elegant or flowing as Whedon I think the street fight and finale battle in Winter Soldier were both exciting and clearly-shot. I dont agree NYC was the only capable MCU showdown. Reply Jared April 28 2016 1024 am DCGUY23 your an idiot. Reply LW April 28 2016 1139 am I saw it yesterday. Not a fan of Captain America and slightly bored by Winter Soldier and its endless cgi ending but Civil War is absolutely insane and powerful with a very strong ending which is rare with Marvel. The fist MCU movie I want to watch again. The hand fights put Bourne and Bond to shame Iron Man is better than in his last solo feature and Spiderman is absolute perfection. This review is right in the way MCU movies are like an incredibly expensive TV show and this is the season finale. Its gimmicky full of one liner with a bland soundtrack but its also like the best TV show ever where you just love ALL the characters believe ALL their storylines and get immersed in the action and twists. The Avengers was much more childish like a great cartoon. Civil War is the Empire Strikes Back of MCU Seriously Reply GoAfro April 28 2016 1217 pm in order to get attention smart for this site to rate Captain America 2.5 over 5 stars while everyone else rates it fresh....then comes the review... anyone will do a gimmick for views well it made us click and comment right... Reply Max April 28 2016 1217 pm DCGUY23 Not sure why youd be preaching to David about this when he still preferred it to BVS lol Reply Jonny Cortizo April 28 2016 1235 pm I think we are all coming to realise that the game is about getting us to come back and watch more and more MCU movies. Remember how fun Ironman 1 was? Avengers? I was so hyped up to see this movie and left feeling like I had just watched a really long episode of a tv show. Come back next week for the next thrilling instalment. Dr Strange is next. Do we really care? Sadly yes. Because we all love these characters and want them to live on a screen. I just cant see Disney giving us the version that we want. Reply yune April 28 2016 125 pm Tired of low quality ?

Reply Foo Wen Sheng April 28 2016 716 pm Agree with the review action to me was great but lack of danger feel due to too many jokes in between fights. Plot is definitely a big letdown compared to winter soldier. The villian plot at the end almost feel as bad as the fake mandarin Reply Pepe April 28 2016 907 pm Saw it on 14 April and the review has some points. The movie is GOOD But I am not sure if I am ready to call it better than Winter Soldier. I was hoping for a Winter Soldier sequel but it started to pull away as the movie went on. If Ironman were absent and Panther played the part Ironman played it would have made Panther a perfect adversary to ultimately turn Avenger.

Reply Anthony April 28 2016 1024 pm Is this guy for real? Did you not even see the individual movies? Listen buddy its ok to say that youre not a fan of Marvel everyone can like or dislike what they want. But youre talking like you know Cap and Iron Man and it shows that you obviously dont. Its not hard to remember why their fighting or even understand it at all. Captain America the mythical hero of WWII. He became a hero in the first place to oppose one thing fascism. In the comics this fascism is given a human avatar in the form of the Red Skull but at its cor Cap is fighting fascist ideas. That was the first movie now lets look at the sequel where Steve is betrayed by Shield the very people he thought hed found a place in the modern world where he could work and do good again. That was his only chance at fitting into a time where he doesnt feel he belongs. Suddenly his new home turns out to be infected by fascists who want to pick up where the Skull started. Age of Ultron? Tony created that villain and created the Vision without consulting the team. So hes been betrayed by Shield and Tony to an extent who is he supposed to trust? Himself. Thats where hes at and why he believes in his views so much. He truly believes that the only person he can trust with the world are himself and his close friends hence his dedication to protecting Bucky. Tony? He is guilt ridden by what he created in Ultron. In the third movie Tony revealed a bit of his character by showing that he copes with trauma by tinkering and fixing things. So hes trying to fix what he did with Ultron but this time hes learned to fix things in a new way. Instead of going bigger and better hes decided he needs to limit himself in order to prevent anything like Ultron from happening again. But why is he so greatly against Rogers? Because Steve has become a close friend of Tony in the time theyve spent together theyve fought against and side by side with each other. Tony is adamant in keeping Cap from making the same harmful mistakes that hes making even if it means he has to beat some sense into him (something weve all had to do with a friend at one point or another). The motivations are solid and have been clearly built up and developed. Zemo becomes an after thought because thats exactly what he wants to be unnoticed and forgotten. And these movies dont feel smaller the bigger they get they feel deeper. There is an entire world of cause and effect action and consequence that takes place across an entire globe and you feel it when you look back on everything thats lead up to this movie.

This is why they said (the directors) this is the perfect time for this movie to come in theaters. It sits perfectly as a closure for the captain america trilogy. Nonetheless BvS was not so good cause the placement of the movie the characters do not have much backstory and less primary plot. Conclusively this is a perfect Phase 3 for MCU launcher. BvS shouldve been wait til the right time to appear.

Marvel is so hung up on playing it safe that the movie ends exactly where it started. Nothing changed. I didnt like BvS but they at least DC had the chops to make some hard unpopular decisions. Things happened in the movie that will bear consequences in the DC Universe. Here Marvel played it like a sitcom.

Civil War as a great refreshing story like BvS had but doesnt have nearly as many plot holes as BvS had... I loved it for the action it has for the way they tried to make up for the less time they had to build their universe for its originality and grittiness but it had too many problems to compare it to Civil War mainly everything related to Lex Luthor and his actions Reply jonnyboy mello May 1 2016 834 pm I saw this tonight and had to walk out after an hour honestly the most boring predictable pile of dogshit film I have ever witnessedthe last time I was this bored was when I was dragged along to see Bon Jovi in concert although I did sleep well during their set at least.

I saw so many horrible reviews I was expecting that to suck so I was pleasantly surprised when I liked it a lot. The problem with Civil War was I feel like Ive seen this movie before.

Its embarrassing to older viewers and too much of a sequel to really get the hype vote from youngsters Reply Alex May 14 2016 949 pm BvS (for me) was slightly better than Civil War. The Russo brothers are excellent at managing a small cast of characters like in Winter Soldier but flop when too many characters enter into the mix. The film lacked consequences and also kind of kills any stakes whatsoever for Infinity War. In comparison BvS created a world where Superman can die hyping up the potential for other characters to die Civil War creates a universe where Iron Man and Cap want each other dead (more iron man than cap though) and nothing happens; Cap even told Tony that if they need him call Also the attempt to balance the two storylines was rather dumb from the brothers ""you are not Nolan stick to your goddamn guns"" I felt myself saying that each time another plot point on the dumb winter soldier army or black panther ""revenge quest"" was developed. If the brothers had concentrated their efforts on a solid conflict and a storyline that shows that the MCU can mature(really mature kids are ready to see a hero die guys) then infinity war is fucked. Another point on this already lengthy comment(ive put more effort in these than in my grades i scare myself) I wonder if Marvel is sexist or just dumb for not giving the badass russian agent(A.K.A Black Widow) or the girl capable of blowing your mind (A.K.A Scarlet Witch) a movie but yes giving a movie to the dude that dresses like a panther. Finally although he was awesome(props to Tom Holland) I hated how Spiderman was used in this movie; quite literally if you had removed him from the movie nothing wouldve changed. At least Wonder Woman had some say in the plot (Although Ill admit not much) Spidey was just a needless but awesome piece of fanservice. Really dissapointed yet still glad I saw it. (Just to piss off some Marvel fans and fuel fire to the ever eternal debate...) BVS WAS BETTER silently laughs with cartoonish evil cackle. Reply Nathan June 17 2016 301 pm Have you even read the comics? Spidey plays a big role in Civil War. SMH Reply Rober655 May 15 2016 216 pm CW was as uninspiring as a movie can possibly get. The entire dialogue felt forced and with little no consequence or catharsis. The fight scenes were especially lack luster as they exchange jokes and laugh while pretending to fight for ""recently acquired"" allegiances. I agree that Marvel has begun to water down the films for the lowest common denominator audiences that arent familiar with the source material and can bring their children to a safe and non-threatening / non-challenging storyline. The movie also continues to portray the general stereotypes that Disney is known for i.e. Black widow now has her stingers yet chooses to go with her crotch-grabs and Black panther takes team Bucky to his private lair in Africa because you know hes African so hes used to ""laying low."" I have grown beyond tired of these spoon fed unimaginative and untrue to the material storylines and think the fatigue of audiences will begin in the near future as Marvel continues to push vanilla-flavored recipe followed movies to the audiences that consume them. Unfortunately I think one of my favorite storylines from childhood will be ruined as Marvel has not adressed anything at a cosmic level other than GTG and Dr Strange by the time infinity war comes around. Ms Marvel Adam Warlock and Dr Strange are still no match for Thanos without Silver Surfer but hey why should that even matter theyll just let some low level hero like Luke Cage become the hero they need since they own it. Reply Rosie May 15 2016 1117 pm Youre blaming the Russo Brothers? The real perputrators of this mess are Robert Downey Jr. who wanted to be upgraded to co-star of a Captain America film and Kevin Fiege for allowing this to happen. In the end this movie became all about fucking Tony Stark and this should not have happened in a movie in which part of the title is ""CAPTAIN AMERICA"". Because it couldnt make up its mind on whether it was a Captain America or Avengers movie it came off as schizophrenic. They could have ended the HYDRA arc in a better manner in this film and tackle the Sokovia Accords in a new Avengers movie. Thanks a lot Marvel Kevin Fiege and Downey Jr. for pissing me off. Reply Armand May 16 2016 417 pm I felt like everything in this movie had a purpose... Spider Man starts to push the theme of Great Power/Great Responsibility but its dismissed as ""wanting to help the little guy"" by Tony Stark because hes doing everything he can to AVOID responsibility for his actions... Black Panther mirrors the blind rage/vengeance vs justice which is what consumes Tony Stark at the end. The villain not having superpowers still manages to not only split the Avengers but his actions brought about the first ""injury"" weve seen so by any measure hes one of the most successful villains. This was by no means a perfect movie... it had its fair share of lack of exposition for its cameos some minor plot holes and while I agree that there was no wide action shot of the fight scenes... I was thoroughly more entertained than Ultrons final fight which felt much more predictable. Captain America pushes the themes to the forefront every time hes given a chance even if its against the law... stopping a kill-on-sight attack asking for Buckys lawyer concern about Wandas ""internment"" which Tony sees in a much harsher light on the Raft even at the very end in the letter hes taking responsibility for not telling Tony rather than shifting the blame (the recurring theme of the Sokovia Accords). Captain America may not be completely right but by refusing to back down for what he believes is freedom justice and personal responsibility even walking away from the shield and the Avengers... he punctuates that this is indeed a Captain America movie.

( its like okay now its time for the 15 year olds to get some eye candy lol) this movie has no heart and way to many moving parts and new characters that dont seem to fit. I was pretty happy when it ended and was left thinking how did the MCU get screwed up like this? Reply stewart May 20 2016 455 am Unfortunately in my opinion the marvel/Disney films have just been getting worse and worse more cheesy gag filled rubbish I know its a fantasy universe but the idea of it is its a war.... nobody dies (with exception of a couple of civilians and a 100 year old lady) seriously warmachine falls hundreds and hundreds of feet and survives with just a broken back oh and just incase thats a bit to shocking we will have him walking again at the end of the film come on seriously Then these numpty critics criticise BvS which was 100 times better then this comedy/family based tripe which they celebrate Up until this captain America was the only thing keeping me giving the MCU a chance but its starting to evolve into the same rubbish as ironman that started great and turned into slapstick nonsense in ironman 3 not to mention the other naff films xmen..antman..thor 2.. etc etc. DC really need to pull their finger out and get more films out there save us from all this marvel/Disney cheese with some more gritty graphic novel based films Reply Bill May 22 2016 112 am ""On the contrary every action beat in ""Civil War"" is such a discrete hodgepodge of close-ups and medium shots that they might as well exist in a vacuum -- at times this feels like the first movie ever made entirely out of gifs"" What does this even mean? Man youre trying too hard. Reply kaicooper May 22 2016 136 pm thiss by far one of the worst..huge step down..this and shitty Avengers 2 both SUCKS till now DEADPOOL is the man Reply Jim Ficks May 23 2016 319 pm These comments kill me. The review was good and accurate. Civil War was a disappointment all the way around. Im sad for having seen it and further upset by the fanfare around it because it means the writers and directors have no reason to change anything. The movies plot was silly the character interactions were pathetic and the action sequences were terrible some of them had a hard hit or two but overall you couldnt have asked for cruddier editing you can almost hear ""ACTION"" before every melee shot. Reply Frederick Laney May 25 2016 914 pm What an idiot. Wait a few years until youve reached at least puberty watch the movie again learn how to write a coherent review then someone might actually think youre not dumber than a bag of smashed assholes. Reply June Daley May 31 2016 1120 am [""till now DEADPOOL is the man ""] ""DEADPOOL"" was one of the worst Marvel films I have ever seen hands down. It was funny but badly written. Reply The Other Guy June 10 2016 220 pm I can only sit here completely bewildered that there are people out there who think BvS was better than a meh movie. Completely Those people should make a quick run to the store and purchase some bleach. Reply Benniethekid July 7 2016 137 am The airport scene reminds me of Power Rangers fighting scenes..

Exclusive Look Inside the Captain America Civil War Showdown Part of the fun of Marvels Avengers movies to date has been having a front-row seat to the super-powered posse fast-balling quippy barbed insults at one another. When theyre not squaring off against doomsday villains like Loki and the ho-hum Ultron they seem to get off on taking each other down a notch. Theyre a family sure. But you got the sense that like most families they didnt always like one another. Despite its stars-and-stripes title Marvels latest billion-dollar-blockbuster-to-be Captain America Civil War is essentially a third Avengers movie - its also the best one yet. With a couple of exceptions the gangs all here (plus a few new faces). And the hook this time around is that the tension isnt just verbal anymore. They beat the crap out of each other too. Its like a family reunion gone violent. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who turned the last Captain America outing Winter Soldier into a surprisingly heady meditation on Citizenfour-style government surveillance - the film is another timely parable smack dab in the middle of our current election season where the U.S. electorate is as scarily divided as its ever been. The main philosophical rift is between Chris Evans Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) and Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark (Iron Man) which shouldnt come as any surprise since those two are also the heroes of the franchises best stand-alone movies and its most interesting and multifaceted characters. After a casualty-heavy volley of destruction in Lagos Nigeria at the opening of the film (coming on top of Age of Ultrons levitating heap of collateral-damage rubble in the fictional Sokovia) the worlds governments want to rein in the rogue crimefighters and put them under the oversight of the U.N. This set-up may sound awfully familiar to anyone who forked over ten bucks to see Spectre just six months ago but Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely goose the hand-me-down premise with airtight logic and freshness - not to mention a sense of fun and joy missing from that other recent superhero smackdown Batman v Superman. Riddled with guilt Stark somewhat surprisingly agrees to go along with the U.N.s leash-tightening plan (the so-called ""Sokovia Accords"") while Rogers regards it as a betrayal of the supergroups M.O. With the doctrinal lines drawn the rest of the Avengers are forced to choose sides Paul Bettanys Vision and Don Cheadles War Machine line up with Stark; Anthony Mackies Falcon Jeremy Renners Hawkeye Paul Rudds Ant Man Elizabeth Olsens Scarlet Witch and Sebastian Stans Winter Soldier (now good guy Bucky Barnes) saddle up with Rogers. Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow is stuck somewhere in between. Lest things get too bleakly black and white Markus and McFeely throw in a couple of newcomers - Tom Hollands Spider-Man and Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther - to spice up the super-sibling schism adding welcome doses of gravitas and light. Plotwise theres a lot of ground to cover in Civil War (even at two-and-a-half hours). But the Russos juggle all of the murky motivations and shifting alliances with impressive deftness. In the pair of previous Avengers flicks theres been a tendency to feel a bit overwhelmed (perhaps ""cheated"" is a better word) by the sheer size of the cast. There were too many candy-colored balls to keep in the air. But Civil War generously gives everyone in the cast just the right amount to do whether its showcasing their gee-whiz smashy-smashy gifts during one bravura battle royal set at the Leipzig airport or allowing them to have a slower beat of character development that one assumes is the main reason for serious actors to sign on to these CGI behemoths (aside from the obscenely large paychecks of course). Even rookie arrivals like Bosemans somberly avenging African prince Black Panther and Hollands highly promising Spider-Man get their due as does the films so-so villain Daniel Bruhls Helmut Zemo. As with even the most dysfunctional families it would be nice to think that no matter how heated things get all gets forgiven in the end. That certainly ends up being case with the Avengers... for now at least. Who knows what insults (and punches) will fly at their next family reunion?

Two iconic heroes duking it out over two-and-a-half epic hours... Angsty agonising over the collateral damage that ensues... Cameos from multiple costumed crusaders just to make sure were suitably hyped for the next ten movies. But luckily Captain America Civil War is packed to bursting with the one ingredient its rival superhero smackdown Batman v Superman lacked joy. Which isnt to say Civil War is threat-free and happy-clappy. This is a film about the violent end of a friendship and the moral questions that come with free will so its hardly a party. No this is the kind of joy that comes with crafting characters people can relate to with designing action scenes that spring and spin and bound off the screen with picking just the right moment for a tension-breaking gag a pause for reflection or a rousing speech. Its the joy of making a movie for and about people. We find our heroes at a crossroads. The earth-shattering events of Avengers Age of Ultron have left the authorities - and many of the Avengers - questioning their role in world affairs. Enter William Hurts politician with an ultimatum submit to UN oversight or cease all crimefighting activities. Ridden with guilt Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) agrees. But Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) isnt sold especially as the first order of business is to eliminate his childhood friend-turned-crazed assassin Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). None of this is especially original - the Watchmen comics covered similar ground three decades ago. But its rich pickings for character conflict and thats what Civil War cares most about not just between Cap and Iron Man but between dimension-benders Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) between old friends Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and between newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and basically everyone. But fear not theres also some light relief in the form of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and a nerdy teenage Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Directors Joe and Anthony Russo juggle all these elements impressively for every awkward franchise requirement (like Martin Freemans here-and-gone-again military man) theres another that slots effortlessly into place - Hollands introduction as Peter Parker is one of the sweetest scenes in the series. A nagging sense of incompleteness means that Civil War isnt quite as satisfying as the first Avengers (its all building up to the Infinity War two-parter in 2018). But overall this is Marvel at their best a pacey intelligent super-sized blockbuster and a roaringly fun night out.

As a fan you are put in the uncomfortable moral position of choosing sides. But you cant. You are rooting for all. Action is top-notch.

It did help that a lot of the cast were easy on the eye but in all fairness the acting was quite good too.

But being a comic book reader (and occasional lech by the sounds of it) this was a thoroughly good film for the more casual reader/follower of Marvel the end fight scene and twist is one that will make you say ""Whaaaa?"" out loud. A touch too long but definitely worth a watchHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 23 2016Samantha HTastemakerFeaturedGreat film for those who love Marvel if you dont then there is a high chance many of the jokes and plot twists may be lost on you.  The addition of Antman and the new Spiderman offered the opportunity for humour in an otherwise comedy free film (even Robert Downey Jr wasnt his usual hilarious self - perhaps a sign that they are having IronMan grow up a little finally).  Big action fighting scenes lots going on and a great way to lose yourself for 2 and a bit hours in the fantasy of it all.  Would watch again if it was on tv/Netflix in the future Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 21 2016Elisa RTastemakerFeaturedOh Lord. When a couple of friends asked me to go to see this film for their birthday I thought Im probably going to hate this but it might be better than I think who knows. Me. Thats who. It was absolutely appalling and the end would NEVER come. Chris Evans (Captain America) is the most uncharismatic transparent actor. The action scenes were pointlessly long. Amongst the huge TV star cast though were Scarlett Johanson and Robert Downey Jr who did a pretty good job. On top of it all the plot was incomprehensible if you were not already a marvel fan...Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 13 2016Kirsty StastemakerFeaturedIf you havent watched Iron Man Captain America or the Avengers you will get lost in this film. The effects were epic and Antman brought a new refreshing style to the franchise.For me the film is too long with no real script or warmth to the story. Too much to cover and was more of a bridge to the next Avengers rather than focusing on Captain America. Definitely looking forwards to seeing more the Black Panther and the new Spidey in action thoughHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 8 2016Richard NTastemakerFeaturedBEST MARVEL FILM YET. The Russo brothers shine once again and show that theyre not afraid of approaching the darker grittier political topics with our favourite superheroes. If youre already missing the Avengers from last year youll want to catch this one which includes pretty much all the major cast members anyway alongside a few new ones (yes Tom Holland as Spiderman as you all know from the trailer as well as Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther). Sit on the edge of your seat as you burble with excitement over the epic fight scene where Team Stark clashes with Team Rogers and becomes an orgy of superhero on superhero action that will keep the inner fanboy squealing to his hearts delight then feel sad again because WOW THESE HEROES ARE FIGHTING and you obviously dont want them to fight. The big bad in this film isnt a big bad mostly because no one actually beats him up but he causes enough trouble to start the civil war in the first place. This is a film thats full of amazing action amazing quips and full of sad feels because argh who likes to see people get mad at each other? Watch it anyway because its a long wait till Doctor Strange in November and to help you recover from the bullshit that was Batman vs Superman.

I did not have high expectations but the movie took me completely by surprise. Its fast paced and has a great storyline - it gives you a deeper insight into the characters motivation and mind-set. But as previously stated the name Captain America isnt really justified but sometimes it is good to have a different idea before you watch it. The movie is great fun whether you like Marvel or not.   Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 3 2016Shona RTastemakerFeaturedChris Evans and Robert Downey Jr.  Need I say more?Great addition to the series There are quite a few additions to the cast based on the last avengers so if you are only following Captain America (or if its been a while since the last one) its worth giving yourself a refresher.Definitely some great fight scenes They are getting better are slowing down some of the really stellar moves in the fight sequences.It is roughly 2.5hours long.  So there were a few moments where I thought... ok this is it. And then theres moreGo and watch it And dont forget there are 2 extra scenes in the end creditsHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 3 2016Babs - Working Girl LondonTastemakerFeaturedI am a huge fan of Marvel films so keep this in mind when reading my review...I really enjoyed this movie and LOVED the fact that there were so many other Marvel characters in it. It did kind of feel like maybe it should have been Avengers Assemble 3 rather than a Captain America though. I thought the storyline was good and tied up some loose ends from other movies but it was quite long and convoluted in some bits and it relies on you having a good recall of events that occurred in the first two films. Overall it was definitely enjoyable...whether its a good movie if youre indifferent to Marvel I cant say but if you like any of the other Avenger-related films youll love this There is also an awesome appearance from a superhero I did not expect to see and he was a brilliant additionHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 3 2016LadyvpTastemakerFeaturedI enjoyed this movie in the sense the mass destruction you commonly see finally has consequences The main baddie is a nuanced guy who is understandably angry. The one thing I do not understand is who this random guy was able to find out about some deep secret that even Iron Man did not uncover. Apart from that big gaping plot-hole I enjoyed the movie. There are some funny characters. It is also very long - bit too long in parts. I love super hero movies and this one is good but not my favourite (It is no Guardians of the Galaxy)Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 1 2016Liz GtastemakerFeaturedAlways love a Marvel film and this new Captain America one does not disappoint.

I am not such a fan that I know all of the movies and the plot lines and not even all of the superheroes.

(Video) Captain America Civil War First Reactions Best Comic Book Movie Fight EVER Take a Good Look at New Marvel Villain Crossbones in Captain America Civil War (Photo) The next building block in Marvels Cinematic Universe never forgets its humanity as it continues to fold real-world concerns into larger-than-life superheroics In matters of global conflict who is held accountable for destruction? Which lives matter? How is death redeemed by more death? And when is the loss of innocent life acceptable? The complexity of those questions is the reason diplomats from every nation work overtime to minimize the headlong rush into war. Its also the reason most of the Avengers (Hulk and Thor are on sabbatical) spend the bulk of ""Captain America Civil War"" fighting among themselves. For audiences feeling burned by the superhero brawling in ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" just hang on -- its not what youre thinking. See Video Captain America Civil War New Clip Shows Team Cap in Action Unlike DCs recent franchise brick a film that spent an inordinate amount of time mulling over issues of personal enmity against an incoherently darkened landscape and that offered little more than lip service to the matter of collateral damage ""Civil War"" is an addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that yes moves its good guys to battle each other but does so in the service of establishing a future of superhero responsibility. After the loss of innocent life in Sokovia in ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" and a first-act fight here that kills even more bystanders in Lagos Nigeria the Avengers face the condemnation of the global community moving the United Nations to create the Sokovia Accords. Their purpose regulate superhero meddling in international turmoil. Vision (Paul Bettany) sees the logic in this process explaining to the others that the emergence of more and more ""enhanced"" humans has meant a concurrent rise in planet-threatening emergencies and that the Avengers very existence is possibly an inciting event. Also Read Captain America Civil War Early Buzz Spectacular Biggest Movie of the Year Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) refuses to sign the accord convinced that the Avengers independence is the only way to address trouble before it becomes catastrophic. As lines are drawn and team members choose sides Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) returns as does a man named Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) who has more than a passing interest in Barnes activities. Zemos agenda necessarily involves the upstanding Cap and his decades-long loyalty to Barnes in scenarios that threaten to turn the man with the vibranium shield into the very kind of vigilante he is not. More emergencies more complications and more new characters pop up -- all of which may or may not be surprises depending on how deeply immersed you are in the teasing hyperactive pre-release dispensing of information nuggets -- and the Civil War is on. Corporate filmmaking with an enormous economic investment at stake has the power to force creative people to operate within the art-destroying prison walls of a marketing strategy. But the Marvel Cinematic Universe an empire building itself on a foundation that roughly amounts to a house style tends to stay relatively on balance. Screenwriting team Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (responsible for the previous two ""Captain America"" films) efficiently move plot blocks into place and check off interlocking points of order but they do so while never forgetting that their characters are more than brands to build. See Video Jimmy Kimmel Mashes Up Captain America Civil War With Presidential Election These enhanced humans are still human and have relationships with one another that exist beyond the boundaries of global crisis. Given permission to be more than objects resisting other objects against a green screen the cast members give themselves to each other their screen clan generously expanding to include newer characters like Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). And Evans performance -- its his characters film after all -- is the center; his story line is the one most beset by internal conflict and his empathy for the torn loyalties of Cap is moving in ways that dont derail the actions urgency or pull focus from the otherwise ensemble nature of the larger project. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo (""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") continue to mine their experience with television comedies like ""Community"" ""Arrested Development"" and ""Happy Endings"" juggling all the members of their superhero family with a playful touch that both informs character interaction and delivers vital breathing room in between battles. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch (who collaborated with the Russos on ""Winter Soldier"") and editors Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt (""Avengers Age of Ultron"") create spaces for hurtling bodies that are coherent and uncluttered; nothing gets lost to the fight-blur that plagues bad action direction and editing. Technical matters in capable hands allow ""Captain America Civil War"" to delve into territory that ""Winter Soldier"" began working through questions of principle and morality and the blackened morass of consequences involved -- as Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) puts it here -- in ""doing what has to be done to stave off something worse."" Also Read Ant-Man Director Explains Why Wasp Doesnt Appear in Captain America Civil War The film tangles itself up with fears of endless war and the annihilation of innocent humanity and in doing so it continues to validate the ongoing series. Its a fact of movie history that films are created as both a response to and a product of the larger world. And superhero movies which are the current cinemas site of obsession over anxiety-making issues of global safety must continue to address the unthinkable if theyre to be more valuable to culture than mere moneymaking products on an assembly line or retreats into childhood nostalgia that only pretend to be making sense of the environment that produces them. ""Civil War"" strikes that admirable balance serious-minded action that never forgets to indulge in serious fun.

TWITTER 5/6/2016 Ethical questions divide the Avengers in Marvelas latest big-screen extravaganza starring Chris Evans Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson. Call it ""civil war"" or call it brand extension; call it a ""cinematic universe"" or a corporate behemoth -- the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studios cross-pollination of action franchises in a way thats sure to satisfy devotees. Posing serious questions about violence and vigilantism while reveling in both Captain America Civil War is overlong but surprisingly light on its feet. It builds upon the plotlines of previous Avengers outings bringing together known marquee quantities and introducing the Black Panther and a new Spidey in winning fashion. Like the previous Captain America feature 2014s The Winter Soldier the film was scripted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely with Anthony and Joe Russo at the helm. Within genre requirements they achieve an overall balance between super-kinetic -- or numbing depending on your point of view -- action sequences and character detail although more of the latter would have been welcome. And while the chance to see old-school Steve Rogers and modern guy Tony Stark aka Captain America and Iron Man go mano a mano is inherently thrilling only to diehard fans even nonbelievers who make it to that climactic moment will feel that something is at stake when the two face off. As the third Captain America film jump-starts the summer movie season and something called Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe its box-office muscle is beyond question. After a brief prologue set in 1991 the film dives headlong into action overkill on the streets of Lagos where the Avengers chase down a group of murderous mercenaries. But overkill turns out to be the heart of the matter or at least a key plot engine. The heroes foil the criminals but not before the energy-projecting Wanda ""Scarlet Witch"" Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) inadvertently sets a high-rise on fire resulting in many civilian casualties. The variously ""enhanced individuals"" who make up the Avengers have been operating as an independent group no longer under the aegis of the spy agency SHIELD and the nations of the world have taken notice of their collateral damage. The U.S. secretary of state (William Hurt) warns them that the U.N. is about to ratify the Sokovia Accords named after a fictional country that figured in Avengers Age of Ultron and where things didnt go so well for the citizenry. The agreement would put the group under the supervision of a U.N. panel and the superheroics of anyone who doesnt sign on will no longer be sanctioned. Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) shaken by a confrontation with the mother of someone killed in Sokovia (a sharp cameo by Alfre Woodard) is ready to be ""put in check."" But Rogers (Chris Evans) who is after all a frozen and revivified member of the Greatest Generation still in his youthful prime sees giving in to the demands as giving up. And so the lines are drawn with charmer Sam ""The Falcon"" Wilson (Anthony Mackie) the first to join Team Cap. Natasha ""Black Widow"" Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) War Machine (Don Cheadle) and the nonhuman purple-visaged Vision (Paul Bettany) side with Iron Man which soon puts them in the position of policing their former colleagues. In many ways the movies red-blue divide (the color distinctions are based on Judianna Makovskys stellar superhero outfits) is far more nuanced than the split in U.S. electoral politics. But the screenplays angsting over the ethics of being a crime-stopper is also finally an excuse for more pummeling clashes. Theres the complicating matter of a ruthless villain Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) and the race to stop him. And not least theres the necessity of world-colliding skirmishes between Team Cap and Team Iron Man their superpowers on showstopping display in a spectacular sequence at the Leipzig airport that benefits from flashes of humor and self-awareness as well as Trent Opalochs dynamic camerawork. Reflecting the materials comic-book roots the Russos keep the films action heavy on physics- and biology-defying thwacks and slams with almost no blood although there is a crucial injury late in the proceedings. Amid the mayhem the movie doesnt necessarily feel overloaded with Avengers but some personalities get to shine more than others. Jeremy Renners Hawkeye barely registers while Paul Rudds Ant-Man has comedy and wow-factor f/x at his disposal to make more of an impression. But for all their kickass moves and fretting close-ups such charismatic actors as Cheadle and Johansson feel sidelined through much of the story. The movies center does hold though in the well-played contrast between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Rogers anachronistic aspects are no longer the source of punchlines and Evans persuasively conveys his decency without overstating the matter. Through their contained performances he and Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes (aka the Winter Soldier) give emotional heft to their characters friendship a crucial element of the story. Just as crucial Evans leaves room for doubt about whether Rogers is right to resist outside rules even as the film clearly sides with him. Downey whose ace timing and effortless snark make him the movies chief comic relief also provides pivotal emotional chords. In a well-earned twist that revolves around Stark past and present converge in wrenching ways. The revelation adds extra oomph to a striking early scene -- reportedly one of the most CGI-labor-intensive pieces of the pic -- in which billionaire Stark uses technology to revisit a traumatic moment. In addition to cameos by John Slattery and Hope Davis the segment features a digitally de-aged Downey playing Starks younger self. Matters of friendship family and loyalty course through the action. Theyre essential to the story of the newest Avenger Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Hes a prince named TChalla from the fictional Wakanda and his transformation is fueled by hunger for revenge after a devastating personal loss. Boseman inhabits the part with typical intensity piquing fans anticipation of the Ryan Coogler-directed Black Panther on the Marvel calendar for 2018. Yet another cross-brand introduction however transparent takes shape as a comic set piece in Civil War. The terrific sequence involves Starks recruitment of a certain New Yorker named Peter Parker and Tom Hollands agile performance bodes well for next years Spider-Man reboot. That scene is tipped by the appearance of the screen title ""Queens"" -- itself a nice joke after the films succession of globe-hopping locales. From that Forest Hills apartment to Tony Starks modernist lair to the cold metallic grunge of a floating prison Owen Patersons assured production design enhanced by the effects teams polished work gives vivid form to the Avengers world whether theyre saving it or leaving it in a bit of a mess.

"Captain America Civil War Review A Peak Marvel Experience | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Captain America Civil War Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 154 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Marvel April 13 2016 | 0200PM PT The most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The shaming of ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" will continue apace -- or better still be forgotten entirely -- in the wake of ""Captain America Civil War"" a decisively superior hero-vs.-hero extravaganza that also ranks as the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Very much an ""Avengers"" movie in scope and ambition if not title (the conspicuous absence of Thor and Hulk notwithstanding) this chronicle of an epic clash between two equally noble factions led by Captain America and Iron Man proves as remarkable for its dramatic coherence and thematic unity as for its dizzyingly inventive action sequences; viewers who have grown weary of seeing cities blow up ad nauseam will scarcely believe their luck at the relative restraint and ingenuity on display. Buoyed by hearty critical support 3D ticket premiums and enormous fan-ticipation Disneys May 6 release should have little trouble outperforming 2014s ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" (714 million worldwide) and could land in roughly the same commercial arena as the ""Avengers"" pics both of which earned north of 1 billion globally. As directed with escalating confidence by sibling filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo (who helmed ""The Winter Soldier"") and intricately scripted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who have been with the series since 2011s ""Captain America The First Avenger"") ""Civil War"" is nothing if not a testament to the benefits of continuity; this is the rare Marvel sequel that feels like not just a continuation but a culmination. You can sense the movie plumbing the depths of its own history with a 1991-set opening flashback in which James ""Bucky"" Buchanan (the brooding Sebastian Stan) is sprung from cryogenic deep-freeze by Russian soldiers who proceed to activate the cold-blooded metal-armed killing machine lurking within known as the Winter Soldier. The nature of his first assignment is a mystery to which the picture occasionally alludes but leaves chillingly unresolved until the end. Back in the present day Buckys estranged old buddy Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) aka Captain America finds himself on a routine mission in Lagos with his team which includes the fierce Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) the telekinetically gifted Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and the high-flying Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie). But the ensuing battle has tragically unforeseen consequences and the U.S. secretary of state (William Hurt) fed up with the fiery trail of fatalities and mass destruction the Avengers have left behind them encourages them to agree to the Sokovia Accords which will place them under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. Haunted by his own role in the civilian deaths that occurred during the big-bang climax of ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) wholeheartedly supports this solution which is also backed by his faithful No. 2 Lt. James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) and the otherworldly humanoid philosopher-freak known as the Vision (Paul Bettany). But while Natasha and Wanda both understand the logic of Tonys decision Rogers is having none of it To submit to the U.N. he feels would deal too great a blow to their autonomy and effectively destroy their ability to mobilize and act as needed. Captain Americas defiance only intensifies when yet another deadly attack occurs this time in Vienna and the Winter Soldier is clearly implicated. As far as Iron Man is concerned the Buck stops here but Rogers like the audience knows theres more to the story than meets the eye. Related Michael Keaton In Talks to Play Spider-Man Villain (EXCLUSIVE) Not every globe-trotting action movie is self-critical enough to acknowledge the many lives that are presumably lost when buildings blow up and cars flip over. And while the idea of collateral damage was certainly central to the conflict in ""Batman v Superman"" that film ultimately banished any sense of ethical responsibility -- and any lingering audience goodwill -- with its bombastic and incoherent end-of-the-world climax. Whatever apocalyptic associations its title may generate ""Captain America Civil War"" turns out to be an infinitely smarter piece of multiplex mythmaking blessed as it is with a new villain (played with unnerving subtlety by Daniel Bruhl) who has more on his mind than blowing human civilization to smithereens. And the sides-taking showdown between Team Captain America and Team Iron Man far from numbing the viewer with still more callous acts of destruction is likely to leave you admiring its creativity. This is probably the point at which a spoiler warning should be interjected mainly for those readers perceptive enough to detect spoilers in paragraph breaks and pop-up ads. Not that it will come as much of a surprise to anyone with a degree in MCU studies that ""Civil Wars"" roster of fighters includes the first big-screen incarnation of TChalla/Black Panther (a striking Chadwick Boseman) as well as the latest incarnation of Spider-Man with the plucky young British actor Tom Holland (""The Impossible"" ""In the Heart of the Sea"") donning the nervous nerdy mien of Peter Parker to terrifically scene-stealing effect. We may be watching a series of trailers for these characters stand-alone projects but theyre damn good trailers and they dutifully uphold the playful egalitarian spirit that defines the Marvel comic-book universe. ""Everyones got a gimmick"" one guy notes wearily as the battle gets under way but for a deliriously entertaining stretch ""Captain America Civil War"" delights in showing us what happens when those gimmicks collide. Under the supervision of the crack visual-effects team at Industrial Light amp; Magic the laws of physics are upheld and gloriously flouted at will; its surprising how effectively a Spidey web holds up against even the Winter Soldiers superhuman strength or just how much trouble Ant-Man (Paul Rudd earning one of the movies biggest applause moments) can cause when the inspiration seizes him. (The one character whose contribution feels superfluous here is Jeremy Renners Hawkeye who continues to register with all the commitment and charisma of a junior-high archery instructor.) The Russos handle the action with growing assurance and impressive range shooting the early fight scenes with an almost ""Bourne""-style handheld intensity in contrast with the more classically framed skirmishes that follow. Even more impressively the film feels sincerely invested in the questions it raises about freedom vs. responsibility heroism vs. vigilantism and what those distinctions say about the individuals making them. In assembling this Marvel male weepie scribes Markus and McFeely show a rare talent for spinning cliches into artful motifs The pain of deep irrecoverable loss recurs throughout the narrative and for both Iron Man and Captain America the bonds of friendship are shown to run deeper than any commitment to the greater good. The back-slapping happy ending toward which the movie seems to be making a beeline somehow fails at the last minute to materialize. Evans has never been the most charismatic or interesting figure even in his own franchise and while that remains true here the opportunity to take an unpopular stand for what he believes in lends this sturdily old-fashioned character a more compelling edge. Notably ""Civil War"" doesnt play Captain America for laughs or treat him as a genial anachronism in the way that the earlier films did; its most crucial flashback to the guys pre-coma existence (which occasions a brief impressive turn by Emily VanCamp) exists mainly so that we can hear his inner determination put into words ""Compromise where you can. And where you cant dont."" While their resolve is every bit as firm as their abs and biceps to say nothing of their titanium suits and vibranium shields one senses the growing schism between Captain America and Iron Man will be healed in the long run (though perhaps not until after the two-part ""Avengers Infinity War"" which the Russos are set to direct). But for the purposes of this surprisingly fleet-footed 146-minute entertainment Evans and especially Downey invest their characters ideological divide with a potent sense of conviction which helps offset the generally two-dimensional feel of the many other characters squeezed into the margins. In the almost-too-smooth fashion that has come to define even Marvels non-Joss Whedon-directed entries a steady undercurrent of droll wisecracking humor punctures the tension at key intervals to continually amusing if somewhat ingratiating effect; its a bit deflating when Iron Man at one point actually invokes ""The Manchurian Candidate"" rather than simply allowing the obvious reference to speak for itself. All of which is to say that this clean-burning cinematic engine may qualify as a peak Marvel experience but it isnt a transcendent one; transcendence simply doesnt factor into the calculations of a franchise dedicated more to its long-term survival strategy than to the quality of any individual chapter. ""Captain America Civil War"" doesnt break the mold; it burnishes the brand and sets a high but not insurmountable bar. Let the games continue.

Reply Savannah says May 13 2016 at 1209 pm The actor for Spider-Man in civil war is way better than all the other actors. The latest Spider-Man is the best Reply PC1 says May 10 2016 at 1239 pm Cant believe this review of Captain America Civil War. Sorry but I found it overlong tedious repetitive and just plain boring. I was very disappointed given that I really enjoyed the Winter Soldier - I cant believe the same directors and writers were involved in this film. Apart from Winter Soldier which had genuine original action sequences such as Fury in his car and the Cap in the lift I have found all of the recent Marvel films to be very underwhelming (with the exception of Thor (the original)). Repetitive hand-to-hand fighting sequences (you would think they would have learned from Man of Steel) and a distinct lack of decent characterisation I will no longer be bothering to see these films in the cinema - if at all and only then on personal recommendation from people I know and only on dvd. Reply Starchild says May 8 2016 at 207 am Ok DC kids you seem to be very confused and I want to help you out I love SOME DC material basically anything Alan Moore and Frank Miller have touched. However I in no way believe DC should get the credit for these sublime writers the writers should get the credit Now to move on you fans seem to have a very flawed belief that dark = mature/superior. That is not true at all Dark + well writen = mature/superior. And a lot OF DC films do this well like the Nolan series. However BvS is dark but terribly written and directed making it a not so very good movie. But you guys are right its dark but that doesnt change the fact that its still not that good lol Marvel movies although light and fun are usually well written and directed and I would much rather watch a light-fun movie than a bad dark movie. Allan Moore is my hero The Proletariat (better known as V for Vendetta) was an excellent adaptation You got me that was an example of a well written dark movie however watchman (arguably Moores masterpiece) was a clunky dark movie that made changes that ultimately didnt work (in my opinion). Not to mention its length while failing to touch on the important themes that Moore so brilliantly expressed in the comic. So remember dark doesnt garentee better and I forecast that Suicide Squad and other DC endeavors will be more examples of poor dark movies. And let me remind you DC fanboys are the ones going crazy and having hissy fits over reviews; youre even saying its a conspiracy I hate to tell you this but if the critics like a film and the audience likes a film then its probably a good film but some of you would rather believe in brainwashing than accept the truth due to your own conditioning...irony at its best drops mic Reply Starchild says May 8 2016 at 1247 am Civil War is very good It met all my expectations (which were very high). Now I know the review compares it to BvS which I enjoyed (but my expectations were very low so ya/). Civil War as a movie (detaching it from the original source material) is smartly (and tightly) written superbly casted and directed coherently without straying from its cinematic vision. And Im sorry but BvS wasnt even close to achieving two of those (it was I believed well-casted which made it tolerateble-enjoyable). So to compare the two is kind of unfair. Comparing them is like matching Ali with an amateur light weight Its just cruel lol Reply ss says May 7 2016 at 521 pm havnt seen civil war yet but BVS easily beats out anything marvel have released the franchise has done an ok job but most of their heros arent very unique compared to each other and come accross very green lanterny Reply JunkerGeorg says May 2 2016 at 1153 pm Wow. Given its length I felt the movie really got dragged down by too much dialogue and not enough action let alone action that wowed you. Too many scenes repeating the whole politico-philosophical problem of Libertarianism (Captain America) vs. Authoritarianism (Iron Man) which in my opinion was already presented and presented better in CAWinter Soldier. Perhaps no Marvel movie will live up to the spectacular action of the first Avengers movie (with Guardians of the Galaxy a close second). so maybe Im just spoiled expecting Marvel to up the ante. When there was action were it not for Spiderman and Antman you would have fallen asleep. Those two provided the most entertaining action not to mention most if not all of the humor in the movie. (""Can I get some orange slices?"" AntMan) Had it been possible having Thor and Hulk in the movie might have made a great improvement on what I felt was simply an unspectacular movie. Marvel has to realize they have to equal if not up the ante with each new movie. But what I saw in Ultron and now in Civil War is a franchise running out of steam burning out running out of ways or simply arriving at the limitations there are in trying to replicate a comic book genre onto the big screen. No matter what special effects technology is invented/ deployed fantasy is simply not as fantastical on the Hollywood screen as it can be and is on the screen of your own mind/imagination in book form. Hopefully our increasingly illiterate culture comes to realize that a comic book or fantasy novel unlocks the spectacular way more than a Hollywood production ever could. Reply lim says April 24 2016 at 1122 am i am a fan of both dc and marvel i enjoyed bvs and im sure i will enjoy civil war but WHY THE FUCK do you have to bring bvs into this?????? Reply Starchild says May 8 2016 at 1253 am I kind of agree with you it seems a little cruel to compare the two. Adding BvS doesnt add anything the review it just kicks BvS while its down/. It was enjoyable but Civil War does something very different and puts it in a different league from BvS. Reply Cke says April 25 2016 at 501 am Because they are the same genre have both basically the same premise and are released within six weeks of each other? Shocking i know... Reply webslinger48webslinger48 says April 22 2016 at 1255 am I love the Marvel movies. I thought Avengers Age of Ultron was amazing. Then I saw Mad Max Fury Road. Marvel movies look like bitches in comparison. I will always be grateful that they made competent movies of my favorite superheroes. I love Downey Evans everything they do. But Good Lord. I want to feel what I felt when I walked out of that Mad Max movie. Somehow I need to forget I ever saw it. Because it was the game changers of game changers. And this comic book stuff is a pimple on the butt of it. Reply Ken Baker says May 6 2016 at 703 pm Correct Agree 100%. Any action scene shot with shaky hand held cameras so you have no idea what the hell is going on should be outlawed. Mad Max should have won best picture Reply Evan says April 18 2016 at 1019 pm I have always been a DC fan ever since Bruce Timm gave me a brilliant DC animated universe as a child have I been enamored with DC. But if I am honest the DC Extended Universe seems directionless. After BvS I was left scratching my head. There was no need to end the movie that way. And why was Wonder Woman in a movie that barely involved her in the plot? Why did Doomsday arguably the most threatening villain in the DC universe seem so insignificant? The plot felt incoherent and rushed. I feel Snyder doesnt even understand Superman or Batman for that matter. I have so many problems with that movie. When the president sent up a nuke at Superman and Doomsday I wondered is the president in the movie that stupid? Superman is taking Doomsday into space where he has an advantage due to being able to gather more strength from the sun hes taking him into space where Doomsday cant hurt civilians and you nuke him?? I wont even start on how Snyder mishandled both Jimmy Olsen and Lex Luthor but how can he make Batman so dense? The worlds greatest detective manipulated like an amateur rookie? Yes Superman and Zod leveled a city with their fight but Superman was still in the early stages of being a hero he barely learned how to fly for chrissakes. And Batman cant see that his intentions were good that he was trying to stop Zod? Batman cant come to that conclusion and doesnt even listen to Superman before beating the hell out of him? I walked out of BvS heartbroken. I was always a bigger fan of Batman and Superman than Cap and Iron Man but on the first Saturday of May I can confidently walk into a superhero movie and expect to enjoy it even if its not featuring my favorite characters. I am ok with DC trying to create a more serious and darker tone but not to the extent that you ruin the core foundations of the characters. Never have I seen a Superman with less soul and Batman with almost no wits. If these characters are truly the modern versions of gods found in Greek mythology then this recent portrayal is downright sacrilegious.

Reply Starchild says May 8 2016 at 100 am Yes it was a very well represententated review. Civil War hit the bulls eye It was an excellent example of synergetic effort to cultivate an excellent film Its a reminder to film lovers what a tight screenplay an amazing cast and unified direction can accomplish.

Sytsma says April 17 2016 at 652 am When two movies with so many similarities come out at around the same time comparisons will be made. It happened with Deep Impact and Armageddon It will happen with these two movies. And it should. The basis of reviews is the comparison of one thing against everything else the reviewer has experienced either consciously or subconsciously. The more concrete the reviewer can make his observations the better. 10 Suspiciously Similar Movies Released In The Same Year Reply Kyle Andrew Gilmour says April 16 2016 at 914 am I dont understand all the hate. This article for me was brilliantly written and comparing Civil War to BvS isnt actually such a terrible thing. I did not like BvS. Not one bit. It was a perfect example of incredible potential but terrible execution. And the film was a mess. And so if you have two superhero movies a hero vs another hero being released within a close proximity of time then why not compare them? I dont see any problem Reply DCisforadultsandmarvelsucks says April 15 2016 at 1051 pm This is the most idiotic article I have ever read. Stupid Disney worshippers. DC is adult and an intelligent film that actually takes risks and makes you think a little. All of DC movies will continue to get hate from MARVEL fanboys and still be to smart for them Reply Graham says April 27 2016 at 853 am DCisforadultsandmarvelsucks too smart for them Reply Bryan Ford says April 19 2016 at 114 pm You have no clue at this point. I grew up reading DC and Marvel with zero preference of one over the other. Batman will always be my favorite. My next favorite was always Spider Man. The fact is Marvels best movies have been better written and directed. Marvel has made bad movies also. Iron Man 2 and the second Thor movie. BvS was just a huge letdown thanks mostly to the directing and the poor writing. My hope is that ever Marvel or DC movie that comes out is great. Sadly DC is behind with their last two. The Nolan Batman trilogy was very good though. On par with The Avengers Iron Man GOTG and CAWS. Making a film look dark ala BvS doesnt make it for adults. A smart storyline and good writing does... so while GOTG was funny it had both of those things plus humor and heart. BvS paled in comparison. Reply DCisforadultsandmarvelsucks says April 15 2016 at 1054 pm I meant Batman V Superman not DC. Sorry. Reply therealeverton says April 15 2016 at 1126 am You people makng a big deal about a professional reviewer making comparisons between the film he is reviewing and other ""similar"" films that are better or worse are embarrassing yourselves. IT IS HIS JOB. A spy film will be compared to ~Bond. When Stargate and Independence Day came out they were BOTH compared to Star Wars.. Winter Soldier was compared tro The Dark Knight. As in it was very good but not Oscar worthy like that film was. Need for Speed to Fast amp; Furious. This is what reviewers do. It is the primary source of the ratings they give.l It is relative to the dozens or hundreds of other films of that type and/or at all that they have previously seen. ~Japanese animation is inevitably held up to Studio Ghibli and particularly Miyazaki and so on. There is NO conspiracy this is just how professional reviews work. It is how criticism works. Youd better believe that if This film were considered poor and BvS had been great (critically) the reviews would be talking about it. Reply Richard says April 15 2016 at 936 am I can not compare movies I have not seen but as a non superhero comic book fan I can say it is marvels great casting that brings me in to see their movies (Paul Rudd Tom Hiddleston Robert Redford ect.). Actors are still the best special effects one can bring to a movie and Marvel does really well at this. Reply Ken Baker says May 6 2016 at 712 pm Well... Heath Ledger was a hell of a Joker. And I loved Jeffrey Morgan as Comedian in The Watchmen. I collected lots of comics in my younger days. Marvel and DC both had titles I liked and some I didnt. Im not sure why we have to pick one over the other? Reply Lee Goodman says April 15 2016 at 429 am I think the opening line is fair comment for a Chief Film Critic to make; i dont know or care for Mr Changs credentials but Id have to assume hes got something going for him as hes writing for Variety. That aside I enjoyed BvS. Admittedly it was a rambling mess of a film with too many loose ends and the editing was all over the place but I enjoyed it all the same. I went to see it twice in fact. As for Civil War I daresay Ill enjoy that and see that twice too. Both Marvel and DC have an idiosyncratic approach to their comics so it only follows that the films from those comics will be the same. You can either like one bothor neither and no one answer is more valid than the other. Horses for courses as they say here in the UK. Im happy to live in a time where there are films like this on the cinema. Imagine being a comic book fan from 1938 and being able to a film like BvS. It would blow your mind. Anyway I digress. Enjoy it or dont enjoy it. Just dont hate on other people who have different opinions to you. Life really is too short. Reply Matthew J says May 5 2016 at 959 am ""Just dont hate on other people who have different opinions to you. Life is really too short."" Bravo. Couldnt have said it better so I wont try.

If this is anything like avengers or age of voltron Ill pass. Winter soldier was the only decent marvel film with the exception of buckey who I gave zero fucks about. Brainwashing is so fucking original. Looking forward to dr. Strange. Reply Starchild says May 8 2016 at 1235 am If you liked Winter Soldier you should definitely give Civil War a chance. As many reviews have stated this movie may have the avengers in it but it certainly is not an avengers movie. It is very similar to Winter Soldier. Reply BillUSA says April 14 2016 at 817 pm While I still hold both comic houses close to my heart without a favorite I can obviously see that Marvel is so far ahead of DC that the latter is practically paralyzed at the starting line waiting for the dust and smoke to clear.

Greek mythology Norse Mythology the list goes on and on. Being larger than life and superhuman is NOT a new concept. It is in fact a innate human desire. If you think characters like Hercules Posideon Indiana Jones or Luke Skywalker arent superheroes...youre deluding yourself. Stop being a friggin snob.... Freddie says April 14 2016 at 532 pm Why is everyone whining about the BvS comment? If this guy is a film reviewer then well he just reviewed BvS in that sentence. No problem there. And if the whining is about how he shouldnt have to compare the two films well that doesnt matter. If any of you actually read the rest of the review he doesnt compare films except when he mentions that it didnt address its accountability issue as well as Civil War did. And thats OK because both movies promised that same theme and in his opinion (as well as many other critics) Civil War did it better. Anyway these movies were similar. Of course theyre gonna get compared. Reply Ragan Williams says April 14 2016 at 501 pm Ha This review opened up with the most pretentious pompous lacy language I have ever read. Not to mention the vibes of prejudice coming off of it like radioactivity off a nuke. This review was just pathetic. Reply Japan says April 14 2016 at 1039 pm Except he takes cheap shots at bvs Sorry it wasnt light hearted and dumb like most marvel films Reply Jonathan says April 14 2016 at 445 pm Disney treat these critics with kids gloves. They take them out pamper them and WB does not do that. Watch Beyond the trailer Grace who loved BvS liked I loved it suggests that Disney and Marvel bring out the red carpet But I am glad that WB is not going to allow some fat azz crtic turn our universe in campy jokes for kids. Reply therealeverton says April 14 2016 at 453 pm All studios do that. All of them. Not all critics especially the ""internet"" ones get that treatment. It makes absolutely no difference to the ""real"" critics at all. You get a bad restaurant review if your food isnt right no matter how nice you are. Films get reviewed on merit according to the standards of the reviewer.. If you think Marvel Studios have been getting a free ride from critics you clearly havent read their reviews over the year AND you clearly havent been following the news on their films since they first took out a loan to start the MCU 10 years ago. ~Even now every non-sequel they make is a problem film and the one they wont make work (See Dr. strange."" If you think otherwise its because you havent been following the business. Reply therealeverton says May 25 2016 at 630 pm  Mathoo - Ta exactly. Mathoo says May 25 2016 at 320 pm Japan - no. He is saying that every time Marvel decides to make an MCU movie that isnt a direct sequel - the most recent example being Dr. Strange - the critics (that are supposedly ""riding Marvels dicks"" according to everyone else) say it wont work because of this reason or that reason. The fact that every single time Marvel surprises us with how they pull things off means that they clearly know what they were doing. Probably have known it even before they took the loan to start the MCU. Japan says April 14 2016 at 1035 pm So you know for a fact that dr. Strange isnt going to work because it doesnt follow the cut and paste of every other marvel movie? Jonathan says April 14 2016 at 435 pm These critics had to knock BvS which I really love for these soft tissue paper made for kids Marvel Movies. This critic and the haters of BvS can kick rocks. Go enjoy your soft tissue paper movie. I am waiting for Suicide Squad. Reply Joshua Strutt says April 14 2016 at 905 pm I LIke BvS a lot but I do think it is a flawed movie and the fact that a lot of people disliked it has nothing to do with marvel. I quite like the fact they have different tones and I am more then capabale of enjoying both Marvel and DC movies.....because im not 5 years old and think I have to pick sides. Reply therealeverton says April 14 2016 at 447 pm So are we. It always looked the better film and hopefully it will be far better than BvS was. If you want to stick to bad films just so you can see things you never thought youd see I get that but dont keep roller skating uphill and moaning that critics and people who dont love a poorly put together pair of films. These same people made Dark Knight a massive critical and commercial success. Where was your conspiracy then? ~They go to see the dark mature multi layered (singer / Vaughan) X-Men films. In other words they like good entertainment whatever the source. From Jaws and Raiders of Th Lost Ark to James Bond to Iron Man and The Winter Soldier -Men Burton / Nolan Batman and so on. What they dont like is BvS because it is a mess and wishes it were mature. People dont love Spider-Man 3 Amazing Spider-Ma 2 X-Men 3 and others (yes ALL films have some fans) because they arent good enough. Same with BvS but SOME of you love it. Good for you you can do that without complaining about those that dislike it/. You can do that without bashing films that critics and audiences do like.

Reply Kamandi says April 14 2016 at 1116 am If you are a true fan of DC comics then you should be disappointed by Man of Steel and BvS for not doing a great job like Marvel Studios has with their films. BvS - four dream sequences in a row are you serious? Its completely incoherent. Who was Batman fighting in the desert dream sequence and what happened to the Flash? Its like the writers had ideas for individual scenes but didnt have a story to put them together so they came up with the terrible idea to pointlessly string the scenes together and call it four dream sequences in a row. Because Im a comics fan I recognized references to the 1970s series ""New Gods"" and the 1980s series ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" in these dreams but how is a general movie goer supposed to know that? Im a huge DC comics fan but Marvel is doing a lot better with their movies. Surely anyone can see that.

If it was a mediocre one like BVS they would have waited until the last minute to release them. In my experience if a movie is good spoilers will not upset your enjoyment of it anyway.

If you want to avoid minor spoilers (as they went out of their way not to spoil anything major) try using some self restraint rather then whining about it because you dont have the self control not to read the reviews. Cary Coatney says April 14 2016 at 208 pm It doesnt matter if the review is good or not. Its going to deter people from not wanting to see the movie other than the hardcore fans if the whole blasted plot is being telegraphed nearly a month in advance. Fine put it up on the international site of wherever the movie is opening but keep it off American sites until at least a week before the movie opens. I know what a goddamn trade journal is. I work in the freakin business Mr. F-ing know it all. ~ Coat therealeverton says April 14 2016 at 1125 am the film starts its international roll out next week. The review dates are kind of set by Marvel Studios. Because of the international release dates an their confidence that the film would get good - great reviews they screened it a month before the North American release and didnt feel a need for an embargo. No media outlet wants to be ""the one"" who didnt get a review out this week. I get your ""pain"" but its Marvels fault mate. Reply therealeverton says April 14 2016 at 248 pm  Cary.

I think that Disney bribes critics to say great things about their films when you see them there share similarities and flaws just as DCs. Reply therealeverton says April 14 2016 at 1115 am Utter Rubbish. This is the nature of the beast. The trades couldnt stop laughing at how silly Marvel were to make a studio by borrowing over 500m to make films with what were derided as their ""b list"" characters. The appearance of Tony Stark in the Incredible Hulk wasnt viewed as a brave and bold attempt to try something not really done n big American films before but a horrible sign that not only were more annoying Super hero films on the way but now they might be ""connected. Every single Marvel film that wasnt a sequel including just last year with n-Man was going to be the film that went TOO FAR and would sink Marvel and Super hero fatigue would set in. Even now go over to the Hollywood Reporter and see how they are bashing Dr. Strange even now. Then theres the reams of negative buzz heaped upon X-Men First Class before it was actually SEEN and got very good reviews. Ditto Days of Future Past  right up until not long before the release date. The Dark Knight got a lot of stick about The Jokers look but after Batman Begins there was nothing but anticipation in the media for that film AND then The Dark Knight Rises. Green Lantern got stick because it looked like what it was a poor film. BvS got stick because it often seemed poor then great then average. It gets bad mouthed because it is a poor film. (This is an opinion shared by MANY critics 72% of them. It is an opinion expressed by may of the critics who LIKED the film.) Sony""s Spider-Man films were given a mixed report before they came out Power Ranger anyone?) Ninja Turtles are getting stick now and before the first film. It happens to all these films. In fact if you aid attention with an open mind youd see that much of film reporting is negative commentary on imagined ""problems"" during the shoot. IF you say every film has problems during production youll be proved right whenever a film is actually bad right? Reviews could no care less which publishing house a superhero film came from. Many of them hate superhero films existing at all and even their good reviews are grudging  through gritted teeth because the quality"" of entertainment cannot be denied. Days of Future Past got excellent reviews because it was excellent entrainment but Origins Wolverine and X3 are savaged for their failings. You need to stop looking through Dc tinted spectacles (And yes there are those who need to do the same for Marvel Studios etc.) and see that this is just the business and that  as with all things you will like things that others sometimes MOST do not You WILL like things that are by some measures not that great ut by others the ones that matter to you for that thing are great.) I guarantee you there will be articles about why Black Panther Captain Marvel and Dr. Strange are Marvel Studios ""biggest gamble yet"" ad blah blah blah. You should consider one of the reasons people are so hard on B v S is because they were so hyped for it. Or  professionally because a film with such characters such a cast and so much money should be much better. Coming out so close to film they set themselves up as in competition with (an error by suits at WB not Dc who have nothing but respect for Marvel and have had for decades) you WILL get comparisons. They both have hero against hero after all. But theres no Marvel Studios bias any more than there was a WB/DC bias in 2008 when The Dark Knight got pushed for Oscars and better reviews than Iron Man Incredible Hulk Hellboy 2 Hancock The Spirit and the rest. Go back almost exactly 2 years. Winter Soldier and Days of Future Past got outstanding receptions but Amaing Spider-Man 2 didn.t. 3 different studios all based on Marvel comics where was the bias there? Enjoy your films whatever they are. Reply therealeverton says April 14 2016 at 1122 am Sorry saying ""utter Rubbish"" reads very rude Im about the bias idea not trying to insult anyone. Hope thats clear now mate. TChalla says April 14 2016 at 845 am Horrible review to draw attention from Civil War to Batman V Supermam. Your agenda driven bias ruins this review. Try to be more professional. Reply SF says April 14 2016 at 841 am I bet Cap and IM stop fighting when they realize their mothers first name is the same.

Reply Luca says April 14 2016 at 831 am I hate the sabotage BvS received so from now on Ill boycott any Marvel product for the rest of my life. Reply LinkOfAges says April 14 2016 at 931 am I saw BvS that movie wasnt sabotaged... Unless you mean by Zach Snyder...

Reply RichWW2 says April 14 2016 at 819 am As long as there isnt one-liner after one-liner this movie is already going to be miles better than Age of Ultron. Reply Bill B. says April 14 2016 at 750 am Ill pass. Sick of these things. Reply Michael Sailor says April 14 2016 at 626 am DC fans are still butthurt. Get over it Marvel rules the cinema. Reply Ty says April 14 2016 at 927 pm Nah Marvel fans are haters and all the hate BvS got is complete bullshit. Marvel will never dare to go in a different direction. Hopefully DC never stops making movies and doesnt just try and please all the sheep like Marvel does Reply Starchild says May 8 2016 at 140 am A lot of people and critics didnt like BvS because the writing was loose and broken and the directing of it was incoherent. You can call fans of marvel sheep but you sir are just as big of a sheep. You defend a movie based on blind loyalty without objectively seeing the mess of the movie for what it is. I mean why was batman portrayed as so simple minded or blinded in his motives? Batman from I remember in the comics (which are among my favorites) is quite cunning and understands the world in multiple perspectives. His intellect is his greatest weapon yet he was blinded in BvS. Another example of poor writing were the use of incoherent flashbacks. As a plot devise it was used very poorly in BvS; it was used as a way to reinforce his justification to stop superman. Which is fine but it was out of nowhere And the average (non-fanboy) movie goers were utterly confused by the reference in which the planetary war flashback was showing. Also they overused the flashback/dreams making the writing seem lazy. Now compare that to the use of flashbacks used in Civil War. Without spoiling anything CW used flashbacks but it used a single mysterious flashback. Throughout the film we learn more about that (single) flash back until we learn the full truth of it (we learn it with the characters) to cultivate a very powerful emotional climax. Does this example help demonstrate the superior writing (civil war) compared to lazy writing (BvS) to you? JT says April 14 2016 at 623 am Honestly how can anyone read an article that kicks off by knocking another movie... Where do these bullshit writers get their skills? Hey writer People can enjoy BOTH styles. We dont have to pick between Hillary and Bernie. Readers are not this stupid. Reply Rex says April 14 2016 at 154 pm And sometimes people DONT enjoy both styles. Like this writer. The only stupid reader is the one like YOU who thinks no references should ever be made to another film the reviewer didnt actually like especially if those films are both in the SAME GENRE. Its called freedom of thought expression press you name it. Tool. Reply Dennis Potvin says April 14 2016 at 441 am You know I dont recall Siskel or Ebert beginning a segment in which they reviewed a new movie by first bashing a film that was released three weeks prior. Nor do I remember them saying anything like ""Woody Allens Annie Hall is a clever film ... but not nearly as cool as Star Wars"" Perhaps thats why I still read their old reviews online from forty years ago ... and have never before heard of you Mr. Chang. Youve got a long way to go to reach their level of professional journalism. If the ending of BvS was incoherent to you perhaps you need to see it again. My family has seen it three times - each time with a packed theater - in three weeks. We thoroughly enjoyed it and gave it a family grade of A-. All of my friends have seen it (some twice) and all of them loved it. The ending is pretty simple - Batman Superman amp; Wonder Woman have to fight together to defeat Doomsday and Luther. How was that incoherent again? Marvel is a kiddie brand for lt; 12. DC is a grown-up brand for teenage and over. They can co-exist. I enjoy the Marvel films but as they continue to be mindless (Guardians) romps filled with wisecracks (Deadpool) smart-alecky sidekicks (Ant-Man Thor amp; Thor 2 Deadpool) and harmless villains (all) their long-term memorability is as lasting as an episode of Laverne amp; Shirley. Yes I enjoyed Laverne amp; Shirley as a kid but as time passed there was no reason to revisit them. Years from now Ill be watching the DC films far more than Marvel. Luckily you will get a chance to redeem yourself when Suicide Squad is released and Doctor Strange after that. Treat them separately and review them independently. It will help you fix the ""shaming"" of your review that is happening ""apace"" as evidenced by all the comments like mine that you are receiving. Reply therealeverton says April 14 2016 at 417 pm Your assessment of Marvel Studios films is so poor you include films they dont even make. Not to mention if youre to include Fox firms that are based on Marvel comics then you have conveniently forgotten that they have been making adult complex ""dark"" but not dreary films since 2000 with  all but two of their X-Men line. Tell yourself that Man of steel amp; BvS are misunderstood ad somehow more mature and adult than Winter Soldier Iron Man PTSd ~IM3 all you want but that wont make it so. You can also kid yourself that all ""fun"" films are for children as opposed to accessible to all with different layers etc. So far if you youre talking about the 2 (3 if you also coun the aborted Green Lantern attempt) films WB have put out against the Marvel Studios films Wb are woefully short and it has nothing to do with their poor attempts at being mature. Marvel Studios have covered sci-f fantasy war films heist thrillers and family ""comedy"". Mature less so and always managed even with their weaker films to garner reviews better than the W~B efforts. WB/DC will hopefully step up their game but dont bring your schoolyard D v Marvel thing into what should be an unbiased critical evaluation and pretend to be looking for a clear evaluation of these films. The hypocrisy is clear to see. Reply Robert ODell says April 14 2016 at 455 am And if you think that was the ending of BvS perhaps you should see it again. Reply patrick says April 14 2016 at 411 am I can tell that the BAT vs SUP bashing is fake I mean it is fake because it is never ending and what happened to all the good reviews it received it seem like the bad reviews came all after so many good reviews it was like a sudden change in the weather. And it seems like everyone has a problem with cities being destroyed why dont you read the comics cities and planets are destroyed it would been bullshit if they were like the damn power rangers were giant robots fight in the cities and buildings and people are not even touched. Reply Richard says April 14 2016 at 547 am Similar genre same genre  similar over all theme in plot and released within weeks - months even years of each other ... You know it has happened before and guess what many of the reviewers will definitely mention which film did it better. White House Down / Olympus Has Fallen ...Hunger Games/ Divergent / Maze Runner...Deep Impact/ Armegeddon ...Hercules / Legend of Hercules ... Interstellar/ The Martian ...James Bond / Mission Impossible /Man From Uncle ...Pixar / Disney (and they are in the same Corporation )/Any animated movie .. Horror.. Comedies ..Dramas ...Gangster ..well just about any genre and they compare them all the time . Do you think Disney or Pixar has an in with critics to rate or compare one more favorably when they are in the same company ..no. Critics will naturally mention similar movies to contrast and compare reaching back decades to make comparisons. Why dont you read a few more reviews other than Superhero Movies and you will see it happens all the time. To your shock and dismay most critics arent invested in Marvel or DC or follow comic books any more than the average movie goer. They are interested in good entertaining movies. Did Pixar pay off critics to praise thier strong string of animated classics? No. They made movies that were overall well recieved and if one slipped down a notch that was pointed out. Marvel likewise has had a overall strong string of excellent adaptations of thier characters with a few slipping down a notch and they recieved less enthusiastic receptions. With Batman WB/DC had 2 strongly praised films and Rises a bit less so . Then came a mixed MoS followed by BvS . Is DC being judged harshly or differently no they just need to start making better movies. Reply Robert ODell says April 14 2016 at 432 am Really? There were some scattered positive reviews but lets be real the overall reaction was unequivocally negative. And the negative reviews began immediately upon the films release. BvS had some standout moments but was overwhelmingly mediocre to downright cringe worthy. This isnt due to some grand conspiracy. Its due to the final product being a total missed opportunity. Reply Fan says April 14 2016 at 316 am Whats with the DC bashing? YOU ARE REVIEWING A MARVEL MOVIE When you review say Die Hard you dont compare it to the Expendables do you? Because they are totally different franchises which proves you are not unbiased in your review. Im not one of these crazies that think Marvel has paid reviewers but could you be any less obivious with your favouritism towards Marvel? Urgh. Anyway besides all that Im looking forward towards Civil War and I hope and expect it to be the crowning jewel of the MCU as I think Infinity Wars is going to be terrible one Marvel suck big time with their villians and two how much story can you pack into a film with sixty plus characters to deal with? Anyway Marvel has always been spot on ninety percent of their time with their heroes and I feel like this could be a great film given the chance. I hope it is better then your review because otherwise Im not sure what Marvel film you could truly call great apart from MAYBE MAYBE Iron Man 1 and hey if you want to compare DC with Marvel I can think of at least four DC films in the last fourty plus years that you can put in the top ten greatest comic book films ever made and one you could possibly put into the top one hundred greatest films ever made simply for its villian. Reply Shiva says April 14 2016 at 720 am 4 DC films?? Really?? Hahaha... Except for Dark Knight and Batman Begins no other DC movie deserves a spot in top 10 all time CBM movies. Even die hard CBM critics (not ur typical comic book fan) agrees with it. MOS is good but BVS is so underwhelming and whole lot of plot holes. No one shouts out ""Martha"" instead of ""save my mom"" . And lexs plan as stupid as his reasons. Reply Jpe says April 14 2016 at 1114 am Actually I feel some of the best and most mature movies based on comic books are from DC. "" Watchmen"" ( referring to the Ultimate Cut only) is pure bravura filmmaking. Also directed by Snyder it too received a truncated theatrical version. But the ultimate cut redeems it. There is also ""V for Vendetta"". I would put either of these two films above even the best Marvel movies. Jude says April 14 2016 at 136 am Nice review. Cant wait for the movie itself Reply mysterydinnerproductions says April 14 2016 at 1254 am Thats a great fucking review sir. You wrote your ass off. Heres to hoping you review my new movie LIMBO 1 day. ) Reply IT--II--IT says April 13 2016 at 922 pm The INTEL RUN Hollywood franchise slum with its endless B.S. in spandex ADD ONs.  - - -----BULLLLLLEH----- - - - Reply Jiu says April 13 2016 at 805 pm Im so tired of the paid DC reviewd stop advertising DC on every article I get that it seems like youre posting a negative comment but theres no such thing as bad publicity when the internet continuously talks about this shitty porn parody. Civil War isnt a versus movie it has depth and political implications beyond Steve and Tonys mothers sharing a first name. Watch the movie Spidey steals every scene hes in even if it feels forced. Reply Silas says April 14 2016 at 318 pm So the reviewer was paid by DC? This is a new spin. Reply SaintSiver says April 13 2016 at 719 pm I am very tired of the BvS bashing. Yes Disney is known to pay the media for a more positive reviews and it does seem that they have paid to sway peoples opinions of their biggest competitor in this case. DC doesnt have to do any advertisement just put the 3 symbols on the title and you will sell. And not everyone knows the civil war story so they had a more uphill battle even with having the previous movies to set up. But this ""review"" isnt about Civil War nearly as much as it is bashing BvS which is just sad and pathetic as a writer. I would like to think that someone working for such a major press outlet would have more professional integrity than to be this childish but I guess I shouldnt be surprised. I did like BVS but I understand some didnt and you are welcome to your own opinion. It is a deeper comicbook movie that uses multiple comics for reference to create a mostly original storyline while Civil War (my favorite all time comic book story) is a single story to follow even with all its spin offs. And they are forcing it into an already established universe. I felt it was rushed and sad because they have treated one of their greatest characters ever like a second hand character in Captain America. They have treated him with disrespect and ruined him so far while promoting being a sarcastic jerk and showing that to be cool with Ironman who was not like that nearly to that point it has been taken especially by the time Civil War starts. He is a business man first. Its sad what they have done to great characters just to be able to sell. I do like the movies but it gets old. Reply Shiva says April 14 2016 at 726 am Lol even WB feared that civil war would crush BVS(which seems like the possible scenario now) and they moved the date. Even the 3 biggest names of DC universe couldnt save the movie. And if you seriously think that these are paid reviews wait till the box office results and cinema score comes out . but I have a feeling that you would come up with another absurd reason that Disney is buying the tickets just to show that civil war is a success hahaha Reply Guill Camp says April 14 2016 at 900 am lets be honest Disney owns comic genres and it seems that also entertainment power and influence makes a difference.....perhaps conspiracy? sweaf says April 14 2016 at 425 am People dont hate BvS because its a dark and gritty movie. People hate BvS because its a BAD dark and gritty movie. Reply thequiznor says April 14 2016 at 220 am Well you dont sound like a salty DC fanboy or anything. Reply Malcolm says April 13 2016 at 759 pm P.S. If you think First Avenger and Winter Soldier treated Steve Rogers with disrespect and ""ruined"" the character but by omission feel that Man of Steel represented a respectful and accurate screen appearance of the man of tomorrow... I would question your judgement and charcter investment quite strongly. Reply Malcolm says April 13 2016 at 756 pm ""Bashing"" implies unwarranted or unfounded criticism. And criticism of some kind is absolutely warranted when DC/Warner a) tried to ape Marvel/Disneys unified cinematic world after years of resistence and b) deliberately pre-empted the long-gestating ""vs."" Marvel movie with a contrived ""v"" of thei own. That criticism appears to also be founded on tangible (if subjective) questions of cohesion plot care thoughtfulness and thought-provocation isnt at all beside the point either. A person may enjoy either neither or both. But dont try to pretend that comparisons - and potentially harsh ones - are not allowed or valid just because you have a soft spot of one or other. It is reasonable to compare and weigh similar films - doubly so similarly themed ones and even more so if their release dates are so aligned. And while clearly a reveiw COULD eschew even glancing digs or comparisons (and these were brief and glancing) it is that much better of a review to acknowledge and highlight similarities failings and points of difference. Reply danontheroad says April 13 2016 at 744 pm Yup. I stopped reading after the first sentence. Its really sad coming from Varietys ""Chief Film Critic."" Reply Fan says April 14 2016 at 326 am  Malcom Actually some of the criticism is warranted and Marvel didnt invent the idea of a shared universe. DC has been doing for it animation for decades mate and its been in the comic books for longer then that Marvel/Disney was simply the first one to put it on screen. Hell even Smallville had the idea of a shared universe on tv before Disney/Marvel had it on the big screen. And by the way some of the criticism was unwarranted like calling it a bad film because it wasnt fun ""rolls eyes"" is like those douche bags who try to say Marvel/Disney is terrible because it is supposedly kiddie. Also if you actually read his comment you would see that he said people are allowed their own opinion. Also when the films are from two different franchises it is ridiculous to compare them. Its like seeing the Alien film loving that then years later watching Terminator and saying its shit because it didnt include some things that Alien did. Chizz says April 13 2016 at 715 pm Movies Ive seen recently Midnight Special Hardcore Henry Everybody Wants Some Movies I plan to see Green Room A Bigger Splash Sing Street The Lobster Who needs DC or Marvel? Its nice to see movies that arent long trailers for more of the same shit Reply Shiva says April 14 2016 at 733 am Wow yea DC has been doing it ""animation"" and yet to failed to do it on the big screen ever since. Yes they have great animation movies yet they had to follow Marvel on the big screen. Reply Marie says April 13 2016 at 743 pm Do you want a trophy? Reply derrrr says April 13 2016 at 707 pm And youve instantly lost any chance to be taken seriously by immediately bitching about BvS.
