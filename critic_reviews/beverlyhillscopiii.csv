"Movie Reviews  911 for 90210 Cop - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Reviews  911 for 90210 CopMay 25 1994|PETER RAINER | TIMES STAFF WRITER There was a memorable moment in ""Beverly Hills Cop"" when Eddie Murphys Axel Foley jammed a banana in a parked police cars tailpipe.Walking out of ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" you may be moved to ask ""Anybody have a banana for this movie?""The existence of this film is a testament to star power--or to be more precise recycling power. Were supposed to be so grateful to once again see Eddie Murphy as Axel that we can overlook how crude and shopworn this picture really is. Its one of the most cynically engineered sequels ever.The kicky appeal of the ""Cop"" series--at least potentially--has always been the idea of a street-smart black cop from Detroit who outmaneuvers the (mostly) white Beverly Hills honchos who underestimate him. Its a neat racial joke that provided a few chuckles in ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and virtually none in its hyperpowered Stallone-ish sequel.Stallone in fact was originally supposed to star in ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and the series has never gotten very far from his overmuscled shadow. For most of the way in ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" we might as well be watching any old standard-issue action hunk dodging bullets and lobbing grenades (and in a masterstroke saving children in peril). But Murphy gives us less than those action hunks do; hes playing out his own fantasy image of a righteous avenger and the fantasy is essentially humorless. Theres little trace of his gift for con-man mimicry. Its as if he set out to trash his own franchise. For the Record Los Angeles Times Friday May 27 1994 Home Edition Calendar Part F Page 2 Column 4 Entertainment Desk 1 inches; 19 words Type of Material Correction Film editor-- Dale Beldin is the film editor of ""Beverly Hills Cop III."" The wrong credit was given in the review in Wednesdays Calendar.Once again Axel wearing his Detroit Lions jacket is brought back to Beverly Hills from Detroit to track down the killers of a close associate. And once again he gets propelled into shootouts and car chases with a clan of murderous nasties headed by John Saxon and Timothy Carhart. Their base of operations is a theme park called WonderWorld which--howd you guess?--features a dinosaur ride. ""Jurassic Cop"" anyone?The Beverly Hills police force retains series regular Judge Reinhold who now has his own office and his own SWAT team. Bronson Pinchot also turns up again as the oddly accented Serge. He has graduated from an art gallery to a boutique selling personalized luxury weapons which is a fair way of gauging how far the inspiration in this series has dropped.At a time when police detective shows on television are better than they ever have been what excuse is there for the slovenliness of ""Beverly Hills Cop III""? Director John Landis and screenwriter Steven E. De Souza (who worked on ""48 HRS."" and the ""Die Hard"" films) are strictly smash-and-grab guys. Like the other films in the series this one has no muscle tone; it wobbles opportunistically between wan slapstick and routine bang bang with lots of gratuitous cheesecake for scenery.Its not easy to make audiences laugh at a comedy where characters are actually shot on camera. And in the post-Rodney G. King era a racially tinged film involving cops and violence in L.A. carries a lot of unwanted baggage.Taken simply as pure action the mayhem in this movie may be routine but in the context of a knockabout comedy its deeply offensive. The film begins with a bunch of workmen in a Detroit auto shop shimmying to a record by the Supremes. The scene is played for broad dumb laughs; then in a scene thats not played for laughs they get bloodily ventilated.But its near the end when the assorted good guys wobble and collapse into frame with their wounds that the corruption of this enterprise sinks in.Theres a fundamental lack of human feeling in ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" that makes you want to avert your eyes from the people around you when the lights come up. Attending this movie makes you feel like an accomplice to the corruption.  MPAA rating R for language and some violence. Times guidelines It includes graphic language much graphic violence imperiled children in an amusement park setting.

Directed by John Landis from a screenplay by Steven E. De Souza. ""R"" - Restricted because of violence profanity. ----------------------------------------------------------------- As I watched a preview screening of ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" last Thursday my thoughts kept wandering back to two nights earlier when ABC broadcast the flawless season finale of ""NYPD Blue."" As the series brilliantly tied up an emotional loose end from several episodes earlier it packed more tension plot and compelling drama into 47 minutes than ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" could ever hope to claim. Its arguably unfair to compare apples and oranges ""NYPD Blue"" is a mature morally conscious and intelligently organic drama that can develop plotlines over several hours. ""Cop III"" as its being informally billed is a long-delayed installment in an action-comedy franchise designed for wide demographics with a simplistic plot a few standard big-screen thrills and the guaranteed draw of Eddie Murphy reprising his most phenomenally popular role. But the comparison is useful in illustrating the difference between writers and directors who serve a pure motive of quality as opposed to John Landis and Steven E. De Souza - respectively the director and writer of ""Cop II"" - who are willingly enslaved to a pre-fabricated property thats so familiar it doesnt need opening credits. Suffering the symptoms of sequelitis they have fashioned a soulless slab of entertainment that uses the distraction of lavish production to conceal its profit-driven emptiness. Thats a real shame because as maverick Detroit cop Axel Foley Murphy is back in fine form comfortable in the role that made him a superstar and allows him to shift from decent actor to action hero and savvy comedian with casual aplomb. In a sequel that downplays (but does not sanitize) the violent malice of ""Cop II"" Murphy still has the qualities of a superstar. Its de Souzas gratingly routine screenplay that lets Murphy down concerning a counterfeiting operation that draws Murphy from Detroit (where the top villain has killed Murphys boss) to WonderWorld a lavish Disneyland-like theme park that hides a funny-money outfit run by the parks icy chief of security (Timothy Carhart). It all makes about as much sense as playing baseball in ice skates but WonderWorld is one of those frantic locations (partly incorporating Paramounts Great America amusement park) that work like a mammoth Rube Goldberg device of action and stunts subscribing to the disproved ""Last Action Hero"" theory that bigger is necessarily better. A tepid love interest for Murphy (played by disgruntled park employee Theresa Randle) only compounds the problem. To compensate ""Cop III"" falls back on the familiar reuniting Murphy with Judge Reinhold as his only Beverly Hills police ally and paying a return visit to ""Cop I"" scene-stealer Bronson Pinchot as Serge the fawning high-fashion foreigner whos now pitching upscale urban weaponry in a chi-chi ""survival boutique."" The scene is absurdly redundant but its a tribute to Pinchot (and to Murphys business instincts) that its also the movies runaway comic highlight. Elsewhere Landis relies on routine action - and cameos by such noted filmmakers as George Lucas John Singleton Martha Coolidge and others - to hide the fact that theres no engine under his movies hood.

Rife with profanity and guys shooting other guys the film has justifiably earned itself an R rating but the characters and scenarios concocted by writer Steven E. de Souza and director John Landis play more like a Saturday-morning cartoon.Eddie Murphy returns here as Axel Foley the smart-aleck Detroit cop who butts heads with baddies as he disses the Establishment. But theres a real laziness at the heart of his performance. When the star is called on to show emotional range - as when his crusty Detroit superior (Gil Hill) gets killed in a chop-shop crossfire - Murphy appears annoyed that he has to like act.Most of the action in Cop III takes place in WonderWorld a Disney-like theme park whose patron saint is ""Uncle Dave"" - a kindly old coot portrayed by Alan Young. No offense to Mr. Ed fans but you know youve got a turkey on your hands when one of the principals is played by Wilbur and youre not watching a Naked Gun installment. Players new to the Cop series include perpetual heavy John Saxon Hector Elizondo and Timothy Carhart as the villainous Ellis DeWald who heads the ""largest private security force in the world"" WonderWorlds.Chasing around carousel rides and Ferris wheels Murphy has run-ins with various blazer-clad security goons as he tries to track the crooks who killed his captain - and who are operating a high-tech counterfeiting ring in a labyrinthine system of tunnels beneath the complex. At one point Murphy dresses up in a baby-blue elephant costume to elude his pursuers - this is what passes for street smarts in an amusement park.Judge Reinhold returns as Axels affable counterpart in the BHPD and Theresa Randle gets goo-gooey over Murphy. The actress last seen on Wesley Snipes arm in Sugar Hill plays a WonderWorld computer systems operator. And Bronson Pinchot resurrects his funny-accented Serge guy. This intermittently amusing character now runs a Bev-Hills ""survival boutique"" hawking high- tech weaponry to the rich and paranoid.The first Beverly Hills Cop directed by Martin Brest was a careening action comedy. Whatever else you could say about it the movie rocked.Cop III by contrast never finds its footing. The mix of violence and laughs never gels the rejoinders are snapless the pace slack. It feels like one of those mid-series Roger Moore James Bonds a star going through the motions a plot thats pointless a script that relies on dopey one-liners instead of wit. In Hollywood lingo Beverly Hills Cop is a tent-pole production - a franchise the studio can count on to more than compensate for the box-office failure of its other titles.Message to Murphy The tent poles tilting.BEVERLY HILLS COP III  1/2Produced by Mace Neufeld and Robert Rehme directed by John Landis written by Steven E. de Souza photography by Mac Ahlberg music by Nile Rodgers distributed by Paramount Pictures.Running time 1 hour 37 mins.Axel Foley - Eddie MurphyBilly Rosewood - Judge ReinholdJon Flint - Hector ElizondoJanice - Theresa RandleEllis DeWald - Timothy CarhartParents guide R (profanity violence)Showing at area theaters Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Cop Iii Eddie Rides Again - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Theme Park Cop Iii Eddie Rides AgainMovie review - Beverly Hills Cop III  - Cast Eddie Murphy Judge Reinhold Hector Elizondo Theresa Randle. - Director John Landis. - Screenwriter Steven E. de Souza. - Cinematographer Mac Ahlberg. - Music Nile Rodgers. - Running time 1 hour 45 minutes. - Industry rating R (restricted). - Parents guide Extreme violence language. - Theaters Throughout Central Florida.Murphys Adventure Trades Hills For ThrillsMay 25 1994|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticEarly in Beverly Hills Cop III Eddie Murphys character starts to buy a ticket to a theme park and is shocked to discover that the admission price is 35.He should have counted his blessings. Last time I checked a one-day pass to either Walt Disney World or Universal Studios Florida was at least three bucks more.Of course that was five whole minutes ago. Things might have gone up since.Yes we Central Floridians sure know our theme parks. And one thing we know about theme-park rides is that theyre always best the first time through.Beverly Hills Cop III is a movie not a ride but most of it is set at a theme park and the same basic rule applies.The movie which opens today isnt nearly as fresh as the first Cop flick was. But I must admit that its a whole lot more enjoyable than the contemptible crashathon known as Beverly Hills Cop II.For one thing III doesnt have Brigitte Nielsen as II did. As far as Im concerned Paramount Pictures has missed a trick by failing to promote that fact.But getting back to the movies theme park its called WonderWorld and its sort of a cross between Disneys Magic Kingdom and the Universal parks. (Theme-park scenes actually were filmed at Paramounts Great America amusement park in Santa Clara Calif.)Ellis DeWald WonderWorlds chief of security is one of the bad guys here. And since this is a Beverly Hills Cop movie that naturally means that DeWald is responsible for the death of a close friend of Axel Foley the Detroit police detective Murphy plays.So its off to WonderWorld for Axel to track down the killer and bring him to justice.I dont know if it was the phenomenal success of last summers Jurassic Park that made the Cop producers think of setting III at a theme park. But it was probably a good idea to get Axel out of Beverly Hills - especially now that the Clampetts are back in the neighborhood.But the best thing that director John Landis (Coming to America Trading Places) and screenwriter Steven E. de Souza (48 HRS. The Flintstones) have done here (other than omitting Nielsen) is to get away from the strict multiple-car-chase format of II.Yes there is a car chase early in the new film. But its an entertaining one in which Axel pursues the villains in a red convertible that keeps losing pieces as the scene continues.After he gets to the park the action scenes take a different turn Theres an exciting sequence for example in which Axel hops from compartment to compartment of a sort of modified Ferris wheel.Beverly Hills Cop III may play slightly better in Central Florida than elsewhere because its fun for a lot of us hereabouts to imagine what it would be like for a theme park to be run by a pack of bloodthirsty scoundrels who ignore the law and care only for money.Im just saying its fun to pretend.Eddie Murphy - who was in his lamentable arent-I-a-fabulous-hunk phase for II - has loosened up a lot since then. Hes not as funny as he used to be nor for that matter as funny as he was in 1992s The Distinguished Gentleman. But at least he seems like Axel Foley again.Cop devotees will be glad to know that Judge Reinhold is back for the third time as Axels nice-guy sidekick. Also returning is Bronson Pinchot as the amusing Serge he of the heightened fashion consciousness and peculiar accent. (No longer an art-gallery employee Serge has switched to selling designer weapons - or as he calls them WEE-panz.)Joining the cast are Hector Elizondo (filling in for John Ashton) as a crusty cop Theresa Randle (Malcolm X) as the love interest Timothy Carhart as the fiendish DeWald and John Saxon as a fictionalized Michael Eisner.Alan Young - who was Wilbur on Mr. Ed of course of course - portrays a Walt Disneylike figure called Uncle Dave. Too bad the filmmakers didnt think to include a scene in which Axel questions Uncle Dave about the parks hefty admission price.I wonder what WonderWorlds founder would have said.

"Police Dog - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movie review.Police Dog`Cop 3 Shoots For Laughs But Misses The TargetMay 25 1994|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.Ten years after ""Beverly Hills Cop"" Eddie Murphy and company have succeeded in what would have seemed impossible at the time. Theyve taken the memory of one of the brightest sharpest and funniest entertainments of the 80s-the slambang brilliantly fast and slick fish-out-of-water invasion of Glittertown by streetwise Detroit cop Axel Foley-and come up with a sequel so silly and pointless you may never want Axel to leave Detroit again.Say what? How did this happen? Director Martin Brests first ""Cop"" was a wonderful hybrid. It had the high-tech shocks of the usual 1980s cop thriller but Murphys virtuosic motor-mouth con-artist raps gave it braininess and comic energy too. ""Beverly Hills Cop 2"" (1987) was a letdown. Just as slick it lost the originals lightness and wit. It got thicker more brutal.""Cop 3"" shows a desire to get back to comedy. Its set in a parody childrens theme park and the director is John (""Trading Places"") Landis. But its not too slick. And after 10 minutes its not very funny or exciting either. Its the kind of movie that can ruin your day if you think about it too much. (Mercifully most of its audience wont.)In ""Cop 3"" the theme park a Disneyland-style place called WonderWorld (shot in San Joses Great America) is being used in a counterfeiting ring by the parks rogue security chief DeWald (Timothy Carhart). Stumbling onto this funny-money ring when a stolen-car chop-shop bust blows up and gets his boss killed Axel is pulled back to Beverly Hills where hes reunited with Judge Reinholds blissed-out Billy Rosewood. (But not their third buddy John Ashtons Taggert. He has been retired to Arizona and his lines handed over to Hector Elizondo as the Taggert-like Flint.)As usual Axel ignores his superiors (including the Feds) and runs around insulting the villains breaking into the park wooing sexy Theresa Randle and generally raising hell with the scared but idolatrous Billy tagging along after him.""Cop 3"" was written by Steven de Souza who wrote Murphys first hit ""48 HRS."" both ""Die Hards"" and Schwarzenegger bangathons like ""Commando"" and ""The Running Man."" But does anybody remember those movies (""48 HRS."" excepted)for their comedy? Schwarzenegger badinage was on a no-brain level. It consisted of stuff like Arnold saying ""See you around fella"" before heaving somebody into a cement mixer.What was terrific and unusual about Murphy-and a little reminiscent of Robin Williams-was the quicksilver mercurial free-association pop-pop of his rants and raves the way he could explode verbally in any direction. Yet in ""Cop 3"" theres a scene with Uncle Dave the doddering boss-icon of WonderWorld (Alan Young of TVs ""Mr. Ed"") where Murphys lines consist of saying ""Uncle Dave"" 10 or 12 times with a big grin on his face. The other actors are comedically stiffed too. Does anybody really think its a good idea to bring back Serge-Bronson Pinchots droll ""Beverly Hills Cop"" caricature of a fey art gallery clerk-as a weapons salesguy who runs a ""survival boutique?""The fun of the idea in ""Cop 3"" is the notion of a huge corny funny-animal park with cops and killers running around in the tunnels. But the movie gets drowned in casual brutalism lazy shtick and telegraphed jokes. And where Axels insolence in the first ""Cop"" was clever here it seems half-crazy. Hes lucky he gets out of this movie alive.Maybe it isnt luck. Maybe hes turned into a letter-jacketed blue-jeaned Terminator. Theres no real logic behind getting a Schwarzenegger writer to do an Axel Foley movie unless you want robot jokes a robot thriller. Maybe deep down Eddie Murphy dreams of glowering at a roomful of people and saying ""Ill be back."" A few more like this though and we wont be as inclined to yell back ""Any time Axel""``BEVERLY HILLS COP 3(STAR) 1/2Directed by John Landis; written by Steven de Souza; photographed by Mac Ahlberg; production designed by Michael Seymour; music by Nile Rodgers; produced by Mace Neufeld Robert Rehme.

And though the film runs out of steam before the end it should satisfy ""B.H. Cop"" fans even if it doesnt provide a full reversal of Murphys recent box office misfortunes. The third installment of the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" series boasts a return to form by Eddie Murphy and a breezy and witty first half. And though the film runs out of steam before the end it should satisfy ""B.H. Cop"" fans even if it doesnt provide a full reversal of Murphys recent box office misfortunes. Competition from two highly visible non-sequels ""Maverick"" and ""The Flintstones "" will give ""Cop III"" a run for its money perhaps blunting its ultimate gross potential. The film gets off to a brisk start with a sting-gone-bad at a Detroit stolen-car chop shop. Director John Landis gets a mighty chuckle out of two overweight thieves mimicking a vintage Supremes tune and then quickly shifts moods with an efficient St. Valentines Day-style massacre and a chase in which Murphy drives a snazzy sports car that disintegrates piece by piece. Murphys trademark grin and lithe acrobatic skills dominate here. Thankfully hes left behind the air of indifference that permeated many of his recent efforts. When he lets go which is not often enough here he reminds us why he became a superstar. The bad-guy trail inevitably leads to Southern California where Murphy is reunited with an old Beverly Hills crony Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and a new cop buddy played by Hector Elizondo. The focus of the action is a theme park called WonderWorld on the order of the Disney and/or Universal parks (its actually a dressed-up Great America in Santa Clara owned by Paramount Communications). Screenwriter Steven E. de Souza has a lark lampooning the squeaky clean Americana atmosphere of these entertainments as well as those overwrought Universal crash-bam-boom thrill rides. Theres even a pseudo-Uncle Walt here named Uncle Dave Thornton played by Alan Young best known as Mr. Eds straight man. Great in-joke is the parks official theme ""The WonderWorld Song"" written by veteran Disney tunesmiths Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman. Unfortunately the villains are not as interesting as the milieu in which they thrive which dissipates the tension. One of the better set pieces in the film occurs on a theme park ride gone haywire in which Murphy adeptly executes some of his own stunts. Another first-half highlight is thereturn of the impossibly effete Serge (Bronson Pinchot) who has moved from hawking cappuccino on Rodeo Drive to selling designer guns. Pinchot is given free rein and is hilarious. Theres more action in his wrists than in some of the films climactic moments. If the ending flattens out it seems a calculated move to make the film more accessible and genial than its brutally cynical predecessor. The restrained carnage could have been satisfying if it had been offset by a little more cleverness on the order of the sequence in which the Universal-style thrill ride is used to incapacitate several villainous goons. A lot of top-flight craftsmanship went into the film particularly Mac Ahlbergs cinematography and Michael Seymours production design. Aces too are the costumes by Catherine Adair with deserved special mention to Kelly Kimball who executed the garb for the park animal characters. The soundtrack is chock-a-block with good tunes new and old. And Nile Rodgers score effectively complements the action.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Whatever juice is left in the ""Cop"" franchise or in the once unstoppable career of Eddie Murphy peters out ignominiously in this poor excuse for a sequel. If Murphy feels energized by returning (after seven years) to the role of Detroit cop Axel Foley a fish out of water in the hills of Beverly you cant tell it from his slapdash performance. The clown prince who exploded in 48 HRS. Trading Places and the first ""Cop"" in 1984 is now the preening fat cat who squanders his gifts on sexist japes (Boomerang) and vile vanity productions (Harlem Nights). More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> As directed by Martin Brest in the original ""Cop"" Murphy created a real character in Axel. This time as directed by John Landis -- whose talents seem equally exhausted -- Murphy merely paints Axel on. The murder of Axels Detroit chief is a cue for tears. When he chases the killer (Timothy Carhart) to Los Angeles and reunites with bumbling cop Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) its time for laughs. Bronson Pinchot turns up to reprise his cameo as Serge the fey marble-mouthed gallery dealer who has taken to manufacturing an all-purpose boutique weapon that also serves as TV CD player camcorder and microwave. Gimmicks replace characterization at every turn. Most of the film is set in a theme park where the killers security force has wrested control from the owner benign Uncle Dave (Alan Young) to run an underground counterfeiting operation. It could have been Die Hard in Disneyland since Die Hard writer Steven E. de Souza did the script. But even the special effects -- Axel saves kids from falling off a spider ride -- are tacky and halfhearted. Murphy shoots bad guys uses the f word more times than Madonna comes on to a babe (Theresa Randle) and even dresses up as an elephant and bumps a kid (he calls him a ""little muthafucka"") into a fountain to show he hasnt gone soft like Ah-nuld in Last Action Hero. But Murphy is hawking a memory and trying to make us buy it as the genuine article. Its no sale. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

With screenwriter Steven E. (""48 Hrs."") de Souza at the word processor and John (""Trading Places"") Landis in the directors chair Murphy is clearly in familiar company as they all embark on his goofy vanity project.But de Souzas script -- in which Axel Foley (Murphy) searches a California amusement park to find the man who killed his police chief (Gil Hill) -- is an uninspired long-winded we-know-whodunit. Although Landiss comic routines provide occasional relief theyre tired reprises from previous ""Cop"" films. And as Foley reunites with his unbearably gushy friends L.A. cop Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and mop-topped Serrrge (Bronson Pinchot) the humor becomes as fatigued as that other dismal Murphy sequel ""Another 48 Hrs.""When a chop-shop bust goes awry in Detroit Foleys favorite police chief (Hill) is slain by thin-lipped crime lord Ellis DeWald (Tim Carhart) whose tanned coiffed appearance suggests a sociopathic TV weatherman. Foley who gets a good look at the killer traces him to WonderWorld where DeWald heads the parks suspiciously large security force.Reestablishing links with Rosewood (now gainfully employed as a coordinating police bureaucrat) and Serge (who runs a boutique for upper-income survivalists) Foley goes on the trail -- and the Eddie Show begins.Foley is not only agile (with the burly security guards) smart (with DeWald) funny (with Rosewood and Serge) and sexy (with smitten security employee Janice played by Theresa Randle) hes a saint. When the bad guys cause the ""Snake Ride"" Ferris wheel to break down Foley (well a stunt man looking a lot like Murphy) hops from cabin to rickety cabin to save two kids hanging on for dear life. When DeWald shoots ""Uncle Dave"" Thornton (Alan Young) the popular owner of WonderWorld Foley rushes the stricken celebrity to the emergency room even though -- at that moment -- television screens are identifying Foley as a criminal on the loose. Foleys like that.This movie includes irrelevant appearances by Hector Elizondo as a new Foley ally and Stephen McHattie as an FBI agent trying to head off the Detroit cop as well as inside-joke cameos from film directors George Lucas John Singleton Martha Coolidge Joe Dante and Barbet Schroeder. Like WonderWorld itself the scenes are arranged into a rambling collection of unconnected rides Foley has yet another confrontation with DeWald. Foley sweet-talks Janice. Foley disguises himself as Oki-Doki a life-size elephant character. Foley listens attentively as Serge shows off his new toy the Annihilator 2000 a microwave oven CD player boombox and bazooka-shaped weapon all rolled into one (which naturally Foley will get to use). And so on.With a kiddie park so integral to the story its a given that Foleys final tussle with DeWald takes place on a theme ride -- in this case ""The Land of the Dinosaurs."" Even more pitiable than this transparent piggyback ride on ""Jurassic Park"" is the battle itself a third-rate brawl that culminates in -- well why spoil a bad thing? ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" is rated R for language and violence.

Again. This time though hes lost the insufferable smugness and arrogance that have marred his most recent movies which have been box-office bummers. Murphy seems sweetly humbled ready to work for laughs as if he knows ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" may be his last chance to win his dwindling audience back. Directed by John Landis who made ""Trading Places"" and ""Coming to America"" with Murphy ""BHC3"" is formulaically continued on Page 44 from Page 42 funny and violent the most lackluster entry in the franchise.Back in Detroit loose-cannon cop Axel Foley (Murphy) is supervising a routine raid of an auto chop shop; the extended scene with crooked grease monkeys dancing to the Supremes ""Come See About Me"" is funnier than both ""Sister Acts"" combined. But the raid suddenly gets ultra-violent -- ""BHC3"" has the dubious distinction of having some of the most realistic firepower in the movies -- and Murphy watches as his boss is gunned down.The only clues point to the WonderWorld theme park so always inappropriately attired Murphy descends once again on L.A. having affectionate reunions with old pals Sgt. Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) who is preposterously proud of his recent promotion to head a bureaucracy called DDOCJISC and vowel-challenged Serge (Bronson Pinchot) who is now running a boutique offering ""luxury personal weaponry for survival in the helter-skelter world of today.""At the theme park which resembles Michael Jacksons back yard Murphy recognizes the parks head of security as the guy who killed his boss. This time out the evil white guys are headed by Timothy Carhart and John Saxon who has been in nearly every B-movie ever made. The movie skimps on the outsider Eddie/L.A. in jokes in favor of the comic potential in a crowded and generic theme park.Landiss handling of the cop business is unnecessarily laborious but Murphys patented insincerity is winning. And a few of the slapstick set pieces are genuinely thrilling especially a riotous nighttime chase scene with Murphys car falling apart in chunks and a spectacular Ferris wheel rescue. Murphys at his comic best though disguised as a blue plush pachyderm named Oki-Doki.
