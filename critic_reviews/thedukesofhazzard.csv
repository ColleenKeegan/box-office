Comments The Dukes of Hazzard As soon as it became clear that this remake has nothing to do with real Georgia moonshiners and everything to do with car chases smashups and explosions I could sit back and enjoy it as good stupid fun--a celebration of lawlessness in a crooked county with Burt Reynolds figuring (a little uncomfortably) as the top villain. Cousins Bo (Seann William Scott) Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Daisy (Jessica Simpson) outwit and outdrive the cops while helping Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) keep his farm. With Joe Don Baker and Lynda Carter. Chicago native Jay Chandrasekhar directed the script by John OBrien. PG-13 106 min.

While driving into Atlanta Bo and Luke Duke (Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville) - those good old boys raised on moonshine hood-sliding bar brawls and short shorts - receive apparently random cheers and jeers from fellow freeway users; turns out theyve got a giant Confederate flag painted on the roof of their car. Its a moment ripe for the sort of ironic recontextualisation that made an unexpected gem of The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) - an invitation to bounce the inflammatory potential of the Dukes unreconstructed Southern pride off against contemporary sensitivity to the regions thorny legacy. Instead the film gives us bashful dodges (the boys mechanic sidekick painted the flag without their knowledge) and scenes in which the Dukes pose as Japanese scientists and appear in blackface. Whether you find all this inane or offensive will probably depend on whether you buy the Dukes defence of never meaning no harm; either way its pretty hard going. Knoxvilles diffidence and Scotts mildly perverted puppy-dog goofing make an amiable enough match but one that offers lashings of affection-through-pain instead of actual laughs; meanwhile Jessica Simpsons cousin Daisy is one of those strong Hollywood women whose strength derives from exploiting her own sexuality. The plot - revolving around Burt Reynolds Boss Hogg who considerately spells out his plans to strip-mine Hazzard County - is laughably perfunctory too though plenty of attention has gone into some very nifty car chases. The gist seems to be dont sweat the small stuff like tact wit or imagination - lets have fun Which would be okay if it were.

"Dukes of Hazzard A Vehicle of Rusty Parts washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Dukes of Hazzard A Vehicle of Rusty Parts Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 5 2005 ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" is like a nice deep breath of fresh gasoline. At first its weirdly delicious and the memories it conjures of fabulous trips through fabled landscapes of freedom to the horizon and endless possibilities are pleasant. But soon enough the metallic bite takes over and clamps down and before long youre thinking Gack My head is in a vise So loud so long so dumb. Burt Reynoldss face is frozen like a Dairy Queen sundae in January Jessica Simpson appears to be constructed of some luster-free flesh substitute distilled from an advanced petroleum byproduct and the two boys playing the Dukes are charmless charismaless and generally clueless. You have to say this for the original Duke cousins on the TV series John Schneider and Tom Wopat They had some life to them. Between them and Catherine Bach inert yet decent and with Denver Pyle as Uncle Jesse and an orange 69 Dodge Charger named General Lee you had yourself a nice enough little TV show to last six years (79 to 85). Plus it kept Waylon Jennings out of bars. It wasnt the real South or even the fake South. Tennessee Williams Harper Lee William Faulkner and Miss Eudora Welty wouldnt have recognized it. But it expressed something if crudely All those kids who were called rednecks or hillbillies except during wartime when they got all the hit-the-beach or drop-the-bombs jobs and were called ""our brave boys"" were human too and had a kind of integrity grit aint-backin-down-from-nothing toughness that deserved commemoration not contempt. This was their first big national anthem by cracky; it followed regional cult pieces such as writer-director (and series creator) Gy Waldrons ""Moonrunners"" (1975) and before that the haunting Bob Mitchum bootleggers melody ""Thunder Road"" (1958). Tom Wolfes great Esquire piece ""The Last American Hero Is Junior Johnson. Yes"" helped too in 1965. It would reach its highest artistic expression in the great Steve Earle song ""Copperhead Road"" (great American song by the way) and take over the mass imagination when we became NASCAR Nation. This iteration of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" seems to have forgotten all that if they knew it in the first place. Its directed by Jay Chandrasekhar who traces his career back a little ways to a cult item called ""Super Troopers"" which some (not I) found funny. Evidently this movie is full of cameos from that movie but how would I know as I remember not one thing about it. You know the deal unless youre from Mars The Duke cousins Bo and Luke (Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville) are the natural aristocrats of Hazzard County Ga. a corrupt little chunk of red dirt run by Boss Hogg (Reynolds) and patrolled by his kept enforcer Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (M.C. Gainey) and minions in Smokey hats. In general the two want to eliminate the vice competition represented by Uncle Jesse Duke (Willie Nelson) the countys most beloved bootlegger. Its pretty much the Robin Hood-Prince John-Sheriff of Nottingham dynamic played out with loud Daimler-Benz constructions in swamplands and peanut fields rather than on horseback in a forest called Sherwood. Oh and the two fellers have an ally in their bodacious cousin Daisy who seems always willing to divert attention at key moments by flashing her headlamps at the sheriffs deputies enabling Bo and Luke to get away yet again. The story specifics here are even wispier than on any Friday night in the late 70s. Boss Hogg is angling to win a big stock car rally and has even imported a professional NASCAR stud to win the race which amateur Bo has won four times running. But could it be that the Boss has a deeper plan something about distracting the citizens of Hazzard so they cant attend a zoning hearing that will enable him to strip-mine the county and turn it into a hole in the ground? Can the Duke boys avoid the cops win the race and get folks to the hearing in time? Miss Welty stop rolling your eyes back there now and Mr. Faulkner please even if your bourbon is concealed in a paper bag would you please stop drinking it through a straw this is what storytelling has become in the United States. The two young actors Scott (who came up through the ""American Pie"" films where he was the weasel-eyed bad boy) and Knoxville (who knocked himself silly in MTVs ""Jackass"" series) dont have much chemistry between themselves or with any of the girls who are supposed to find them so alluring. They seem to be in different movies and neither seems very southern at all. Willie Nelson has about three lines all of them old Borscht Belt jokes and Simpson never appears to be either (a) comfortable or (b) from Planet Earth. That leaves the two old dogs to carry the show. Old Dog One is Reynolds and though I will always love this agreeable rogue and scalawag -- he made some fine entertainment -- his quest for eternal beauty through the fountain of youth called plastic surgery has left his face weirdly inert. Nope no wrinkles but no motion either. Also hes no longer big but superthin and light of foot almost gaminlike -- his power is gone and in its place is a downsized reduction of the great laughing stud who dominated American films all through the 70s and well into the 80s. Hes become his own bobble-head Almost for contrast Old Dog Two former almost-star Joe Don Baker (the original Buford Pusser in ""Walking Tall"" and a terrifying hit man in ""Charlie Varrick"") appears as the Governor and stands for the natural aging process Hes lumpy baggy fat his face looks like somebody pulled it behind the General Lee on a midnight run between Macon and Athens but hes still less freakish than whatever it is Burt Reynolds has turned into. As for the endless car chases they seem less developed than they were on the TV series even if the budget is higher and they can do a lot more wrecking. The one thing ""Dukes of Hazzard"" does well however is to fire the General Lee like an orange Atlas missile almost to orbital altitude. The car sails through the air as if Evel Knievel is behind the wheel and thats the Grand Canyon down there not the red dirt of Hazzard County. If you like to see cars fly this is the movie for you. The Dukes of Hazzard (106 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content crude and drug-related humor profanity and comic violence.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Dukes is good ol barnyard fun By Mike Clark USA TODAY This weeks alternative to T.S. Eliot is The Dukes of Hazzard spun off with screechy wheels from the old CBS television series about moonshine cutoffs and jukeboxes where youd expect to find Merle Haggards The Girl Turned Ripe (and the Pickers Came Today). Johnny Knoxville (left) plays Luke Duke Sean William Scott (right) plays Bo Duke and the car (center) plays the General Lee. Warner Bros. Its for people who have always wanted to see Willie Nelson (""Uncle Jesse"") lob Molotov cocktails on a freeway and smoke weed with Joe Don Baker who plays Georgias governor. Its apparently not for people like Ben Jones (""Cooter"" in the original) who has called the script ""a sleazy insult."" About the movie The Dukes of Hazzard   1/2 (out of four) Stars Johnny Knoxville Seann William Scott Jessica Simpson Burt Reynolds Willie Nelson Lynda Carter Joe Don Baker Director Jay Chandrasekhar Distributor Warner Bros. Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Rated PG-13 for sexual content crude and drug-related humor language and comic action violence Opens Friday nationwide Jones must not get out much given that this variation puts Johnny Knoxville as Luke Duke Seann William Scott as cousin Bo Duke and Jessica Simpson as cousin Daisy through fairly benign low-jinks with one or two fornication asides. The plot turns on a crooked town boss (Burt Reynolds) scarfing up the land of every clan in the county so he can consolidate and then plunder the fortunes of a coal mine. I think I saw this one three or four times on The Roy Rogers Show when I was a kid. Of course Reynolds wants to strip-mine giving the story redeeming social value amid incessant car chases (stunt work is tops) and a Luke-Bo college sorority stop in Atlanta full of fish-out-of-water (or given the family trade make that hooch) humor. Otherwise critic-proof Dukes is the years ultimate ""it is what it is"" movie though its probably worth noting that a toned Simpson fails to project much beyond what she projects in the print ads (which aint hay). You cant blame the millions who will fantasize about Gen. Sherman burning the movies negative but when it comes to the home market this will be a good one for its target audience to pass out to.

Starring Seann William Scott Johnny Knoxville Burt Reynolds and Jessica Simpson. Directed by Jay Chandrasekhar. (PG-13. 97 minutes.At Bay Area theaters.) There are routine movies and others that blaze a trail. There are routine bad movies and others so horrendous that they redefine bad that make us look up synonyms for agonizing and abysmal and then gnash our teeth because the language has not kept pace with the decline of film. There are even movies that are so blazingly rotten that they can redefine past experiences and make us look back on recent weak efforts like ""Stealth"" or ""Fantastic Four"" and think ""Ooh that was fascinating."" ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" is hardly some routine bad movie. Rather its one of the elite right up there with ""I Am Curious ... Yellow"" (1967) and Bo Dereks ""Ghosts Cant Do It"" (1990) in stiff competition for the lamest thing ever put on celluloid. Of course that makes it by default the worst film so far of the 21st century but to say that does little to acknowledge the ambition behind this project. Make no mistake director Jay Chandrasekhar was swinging for the fences with this one. He was shooting for the millennium. The movie establishes with startling economy that its about two imbeciles. In a sleepy rural county a red car comes blazing down a country road careening and swerving while the two morons in the front seats yell ""Woo-ooo"" and ""Yee-haaa"" These are Bo (Seann William Scott) and Luke Duke (Johnny Knoxville) the loudest laughingest hell-raisingest pair of single- celled organisms ever to get a Georgia drivers license. Theyre delivering moonshine for their uncle (Willie Nelson) when Luke decides to stop for a sexual interlude with some girl. Soon her father comes home and gets out the shotgun and were launched on a chase scene technically the movies first. This is where the movie derails though thats only clear in retrospect. The Dukes are in one car and their pursuers are in another. The pursuers are shooting at them but they miss. Everything bad that follows can be traced to that one flaw in marksmanship. Based on the long-running TV series of the same name which premiered on CBS in 1979 the movie presents as its heroes a pair of callous stupid vandals who go around destroying property and laughing about it. Their saving grace were told is their good nature. But unlike their vandalism and stupidity their good nature is something we have to take on faith. The depiction of these good ol boys is essentially caught in a dead zone between satire and celebration in which the audience is expected to laugh but not pass judgment and just appreciate the life force that makes fellows want to shoot flaming arrows into gasoline cans -- even if we think their energy is misdirected. Easily 50 percent of the movie consists of chase scenes and each one is identical. The boys ride in cause trouble and ride out laughing as people shoot at them. Theres no way to care about whether theyre caught and no room for hope that they even could be caught much less killed. The movie establishes as a villain Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) who wants to turn a big chunk of Hazzard into a coal mine. But given the people who live in Hazzard a coal mine sounds good. A landfill sounds good. A meteor sounds good. Between chases the Dukes often call upon their cousin Daisy the prettiest gal in town to act sexy and use her feminine wiles on some bureaucrat. Singer Jessica Simpson in her first film role plays these seduction scenes with admirable self-assurance but of a kind thats also faintly embarrassing. Its as if someone told her something about herself that wasnt quite true. Three back-to-back chases form the climax. Theyre excruciating. The comedy is nonexistent. The filmmakers couldnt buy a laugh in a burning poppy field. The movie is only 97 minutes long but it makes time stretch so that its impossible to feel comfortable in one sitting position for more than five minutes. Instead of releasing this film in theaters they should have sent it straight to Guantanamo at least while its still legal. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and violence.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Once upon a time the Box Office Fairy sewed together a form-fitting pair of denim cutoffs. No one knows if the Box Office Fairy is good or evil; she merely casts her spells and lets the market sort out the details sordid or sublime. Hollywood mortals discovered the denim shorts and asked Jessica Simpson to try them on. They were wicked pleased with what they saw and commissioned a script. Two bikinis a halter top and assorted pairs of 4-inch heels later we have ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" which purports to be a remake of a TV show but is more accurately a remake of Jessicas vapid modeling career. Throw in car chases for the dead spots when Jessica is tied up in wardrobe and it passes for a movie. Many people will love ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" those fans of the mythical Stoopid South waxing nostalgic for inbred cousins villains in ice-cream suits and that innocent time when NASCAR was sponsored by Winston cigarettes not Nextel. Some of those people include one of my own children who will be written out of the will in favor of a more discriminating sister who was decent enough not to laugh when the outhouse blew up. Tan my Yankee hide fer choosing last years ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" remake. Its a battle between winking irony and winking acceptance and ""Dukes"" fans never met a flying car they didnt eagerly accept into the Sacred Brotherhood of Yee-Haw. ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" as a movie is no worse or better than an episode of the 1979-1985 TV show but itll cost you 9.25 better spent on moonshine. If you have to ask for a plot you cant afford it. Bo and Luke Duke (Method morons Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville) drive fast and meet purty gals while delivering corn liquor for Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). Cousin Daisy (Simpson) wears push-up bras and punches any man audacious enough to stare at the results. The Dukes are sorely put upon by Boss Hogg portrayed by Burt Reynolds. Reynolds Simpson Nelson and Lynda Carter often forget they are in a movie so intent are they to win the Dixie Cup awarded annually to the worst actor in a film where a Dodge Charger busts through a red barn. For fans of old school grainy film entertainment its all here The hood slide. The double take. The whole fall-in-the-mud chain-tied-to-the-axle git-to-the-courthouse-by-noon-or-there-aint-gonna-be-any-town-left redneck trifecta. At least in ""Deliverance"" they were kind enough to cover it all with a flood at the end. Purists will spit a wad of chaw at a liberal twist with the Dukes asking an activist judge to block a strip mine. Are those Yankees nuts? Dont they know how much gator juice Uncle Jesse could sell to a bunch of red-gummed coal diggers? Aside from that little slip ""Dukes"" is nearly unblemished bombast and buffoonery.

RELATED Gallery TV shows into movies YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Jessica Simpson Burt Reynolds Johnny Knoxville or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" is a prime example of a sad Hollywood habit taking a popular -- but rather dumb -- TV show and turning it into a totally stupid and meaningless film. This flick is a car wreck with boobs.Now let me just say if your idea of a good film is a nearly naked Jessica Simpson and completely over-the-top chase scenes then this movie is for you.If however youre not a teenage boy with raging hormones -- and you like films with an actual plot (instead of walking and talking cliches) -- this movie may put you into a coma. The storyline is so dumb and predictable it wouldnt have even made the grade for an episode of the original TV series.Taking over the roles made famous by Tom Wopat and John Schneider are Sean William Scott as Bo Duke and Johnny Knoxville as his cousin Luke. Jessica Simpson plays the role of another cousin Daisy Duke a woman who apparently thinks clothing is optional.Rounding out this southern-fried family is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse the mastermind behind the Dukes main source of income -- moonshine.And Burt Reynolds proving that his career has rapidly slid downhill plays the one-dimensional role of the evil and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg.Living for cars and girlsThe plot in a nutshell -- which is where it belongs -- is that Hogg has hatched a scheme to defraud the Dukes and their neighbors of their property in order to strip-mine the land for coal.Adding to the ""fun"" is an annual car race that Bo has won for the last four years driving his infamous 1969 Dodge Charger the General Lee.Thats about it in terms of a storyline. The rest of the film consists of the boys chasing women and being chased by dozens of police cars throughout the state of Georgia as the Dukes try to stop Hogg from ruining Hazzard CountyScott and Knoxville try their best to infuse this flick with a semblance of comedy. But ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" is totally free of any creativity. Its nothing more than a bunch of cars flying through space and some well-endowed farm girls. Simpson -- in her feature film debut -- is basically reduced to a sexual punch line. Jessica Simpson plays Daisy Duke and Willie Nelson is Uncle Jesse. Screenwriter John OBrien -- who also penned another TV show ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" into a lousy film -- has created a movie full of bad punch lines and insulting stereotypes about people who live in the rural South.Director Jay Chandrasekhar -- who created the low-budget indie hit ""Super Troopers"" -- is basically just directing traffic as the movie stumbles from one lame scene to another.The films only redeeming feature is the end credits which show extremely funny outtakes from the movie. Unfortunately they come about 103 minutes into the 106-minute film.Hollywoods trade papers are full of stories about the low box office numbers for this summers movies. If youre looking for an answer as to why this is the case look no further than ""The Dukes of Hazzard.""

"Skimpy acting exposes weak Dukes of Hazzard - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Skimpy acting exposes weak Dukes of Hazzard By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 5 2005 As the corrupt Georgia commissioner Boss Hogg in the movie version of The Dukes of Hazzard"" Burt Reynolds wears cream-colored three-piece suits that match his teeth. His hair is a shiny silver pelt and he wont enter a scene unless he can walk off with it. The movie sadly lets him down. Theres nothing to steal. The Dukes of Hazzard"" is a cheap greasy time at the multiplex. You leave annoyed at having been hungry enough to have ever wanted it in the first place.The film remains faithful to the gamboling spirit of the series. But Jessica Simpsons bodacious contributions notwithstanding theres just no body. Cousins and moonshine couriers Bo and Luke (Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville) race from one vehicular pileup to the next in the name of stopping Boss Hogg from razing their Uncle Jesses farm to build a strip mine for coal.Hoggs scheme manages to rope in a famous homegrown stock car racer whos too good for Hazzard. And it affords the boys a trip to a college campus which had been like kryptonite to them. Then Luke gets a gander at some of the co-eds.Simpson the singer and reality-television wife plays Daisy Duke the cousin whos always bailing the boys out of trouble. She acknowledges that her resources are simultaneously ample and limited. Bo and Luke will surely get themselves locked up and Im gonna have to wag my [butt] to get them out"" she complains with refreshing awareness.The movie lets her be as canny as Catherine Bach was in the original show yet shes still just a tease for the horndogs on the set and in the audience. Her wiles consist of walking up to men in her eponymous short-shorts. Simpson has legs for weeks and while this is hardly the occasion to evaluate her craft as an actor she does give her scenes a charge that the movie cant sustain. Every time she knocks our hair back the film abruptly moves on. Screenwriter John OBrien and director Jay Chandrasekhar attempt to bring the Dukes into the 21st century but their efforts dont pan out. When Bo and Luke leave their backwoods county for Atlanta theyre given grief over the Confederate flag painted on the roof of their car the General Lee. But the boys encounters with a house full of randy sorority girls annoyed African-Americans and a college science lab just confirm that theyre brainless live-action cartoons. (Though Luke teaches us that the politically correct term for redneck hillbilly"" is Appalachian American."")OBrien was a writer of last years Starsky amp; Hutch"" which was a gas because it shrewdly if crudely had fun not merely with the premise of the TV series but with the essence of its era. The filmmakers transformed a serious cop show into a wall-to-wall work of kitsch. The Dukes of Hazzard"" by comparison just feels like an extended lost episode of the original show. (As Uncle Jesse Willie Nelson does get to revel in his unabashed love for weed and its a funny moment that comes far too late in the action.)The real trouble is that the movie cant determine what type of dumb it would like to be. Raucous? Juvenile? Ironic and knowingly dumb? Is it good-natured? Mean? With bigger or more interesting stars on display these arent questions youd be forced to ask. But Scott and Knoxville are crash-test dummies. They both have stick-on accents and Scott spends half the movie in a regionally inappropriate Led Zeppelin T-shirt that should have won him a black eye from an Allman brother. His idiot shtick has its amusements which surface whenever the movie throws a girl in his way. But its not enough to wrest The Dukes of Hazzard"" from mediocrity.This is a movie crying out for actors to bend the proceedings to their will the way Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson might. With the Bo and Luke we get its tough to tell whether Scott and Knoxville are in on the joke or the brunt of it.The worst news is that The Dukes of Hazzard"" arrives thoroughly upstaged by Simpsons cheeky music video for the film. (Given the brevity of her Daisy Dukes you can take cheeky"" however you like.) The song is a customized version of These Boots Are Made for Walking"" and the video farcically suggests in three-and-a-half minutes the exuberant musical hoedown the whole thing should have been right down to Simpson giving the General Lee a sponge bath in a bikini. The movie itself is 100 minutes of anticlimax. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Dukes of Hazzard Just Enjoy The Ride washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On On Screen Dukes of Hazzard Just Enjoy The Ride Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 5 2005 IF THERES one thing Warner Bros. knew it had with ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" it was a bedrock of audience recognition and sentimentality. Theres a whole lot of armchair outlaws out there who remember that long-running Friday night TV show (six seasons from 1979) with a certain fondness. They remember Georgia cousins Bo (John Schneider) and Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) who slid out the windows of their beloved 69 orange Dodge Charger (the General Lee) and negotiated those fishtail turns as they ran forever from the cops. Their good-natured souls somehow protected them from anyone who wished them harm from cops to redneck troublemakers to highbrow TV critics. Audiences also remember Daisy Duke (Catherine Bach) in the briefest of short pants who was the cutesy equivalent of Elly May from ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" And they remember that benevolent narrator who softened up viewers with his omniscient homespun drawl. The movie version which stars Seann William Scott as Bo and Johnny Knoxville as Luke is smart enough not to mess with a good thing. Director Jay Chandrasekhar whose goofy ""Super Troopers"" and ""Club Dread"" qualify him eminently for the job has found the perfect balance of old-fashioned charm and postmodern touches -- but not too many to overshadow the shows precious texture. Scott and Knoxville who are capable of outrageous and dark comedy rein in those impulses to play the angelic duo. And Jessica Simpson -- who did not fend off offers for other acting projects from the Royal Shakespeare Company to play Daisy -- has obviously worked hard with her personal trainer. Putting the official rebel stamp on the proceedings are two seasoned southerners Burt Reynolds plays the sneaky dandyish commissioner by the name of Boss Hogg and Willie Nelson is Uncle Jesse L. Duke the moonshine-making joker played on the TV show by Denver Pyle. Which is to say that ""Dukes"" the movie is more charmingly lowbrow than screamingly funny and it doesnt seem the slightest bit interested in straying from the formula of screeching cars barroom brawls and other southern cliches (without the white-hooded touches of course). Anyone going to this movie would want no less and it seems no more. This is one unusual case in which aiming for a middling C grade turns out to be A-plus work. THE DUKES OF HAZZARD (PG-13 106 minutes) -- Contains obscenity and mild sexual situations crude and drug-related humor and comic action violence. Area theaters.

"Dukes of Hazzard The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dukes-of-hazzard-the ) Dukes of Hazzard The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Since it is not possible to endure The Dukes of Hazzard without finding some other task to occupy ones mind (straight viewing could result in brain damage) I passed the time by re-constructing what might have been the pitch meeting in which Warner Brothers executives green-lighted this project. This is reproduced here in lieu of a review (which would amount to a lot of negative adjectives strung together with phrases like ""one of the worst movies of the year"" and ""makes The Devils Rejects look a lot more appealing""). Executive 1 We need to find something to get us back on top. Executive 2 But no one can come up with ideas that will appeal to teenage boys. All of our scripts are highfalutin things like the one Clint is directing. Whats it called? Million Dollar Man? Wasnt that a Universal TV series? Executive 1 No Clints movie is Million Dollar Baby and has nothing to do with the TV series. Mores the pity. Clints made a lot of money for us so we had to let him do it even though it will sink like a rock. Have you read the script? What a downer. No ones going to see it. But I think youve got something there. Lets do another re-make. Executive 2 How about a French film? We can change the ending to make it happy. Executive 1 Nah. Even with the better ending too arty. Remember we want teenage boys. We need car crashes chases girls in bikinis that sort of stuffa| Executive 2 What about a 70s TV show? Then we can get some of the dads too since there will be the nostalgia thing. Executive 1 Right right. Make it cheap and its sure to bring in the bucks. What shows havent been remade? I think most of them have already been done. Executive 2 CHiPs. Emergency Marcus Welby M.D. The Dukes of Hazzard. Executive 1 CHiPs is perfect but its not ours. Neither is Emergency And how the hell are you going to get car crashes into Marcus Welby? The Dukes of Hazzard is a piece of shit but that means box office appeal. People love bad TV shows turned into movies. Executive 2 I have an idea - how about making a movie so excruciatingly unbearable that it will make the TV series look good. That way when we come out with the Dukes DVDs people will be clamoring for them. Executive 1 Brilliant But we still need to pack enough people into the movie for it to make back its cost on opening weekend before word gets out. By the Monday after its release it will smell worse than three-day old fish. Executive 2 We can hire a screenwriter although we dont really need a script. Just have him throw something together about a car race and the bad guy Boss Hogg buying up land so he can strip-mine it. The Dukes are in the way so he puts together a nefarious plot to get them out of the way. Then throw in all The Dukes of Hazzard elements. Avoid top-notch talent behind the camera. Hire a virtually unknown director and dont worry about competent editing. No ones going to care if there are continuity problems in the car chases or if nothing makes sense. In fact why bother? Cut corners everywhere. Executive 1 Speaking of talent who do we get to star? The originals are alive but theyre too old. Maybe they could make cameosa| Executive 2 Foggedaboutit. No one will know who they are. Get two B-list guys whose salaries wont break the bank. Johnny Knoxville as Luke Duke (the one with black hair) and Seann William Scott as Bo (the blonde). Ray Ray and Stifler. Neither can act so they wont upstage the car. And lets face it - the General Lee makes the movie. Without the car you dont have anything. During the TV series half the fan mail was for that car. Executive 1 What about the girl? The one in the hot pants. Executive 2 Britney Spears? Executive 1 No shes passA(c). She couldnt open a movie if it came with a zipper. Maybe if we had made this a couple of years ago. When this movie hits theaters shell probably be barefoot and pregnant. How about the ""Chicken of the Sea"" girl? Whats her name? Executive 2 Jessica Simpson. Executive 1 No not the chick from the cartoon. The one from the reality show. Executive 2 Yeah Jessica Simpson. She cant act. She looks like a life-size Barbie with an expression to match. Plastic. Like one of those expensive blow-up dolls. Executive 1 Put her in a bikini and no male under 17 will care whether she can act. Who cares if it doesnt make sense why shes in a bikini. Just get her to undress in every scene. What about the rest of the cast? How about Willie Nelson as the whacked out uncle Jesse. Nelsons long hair and stoned look will be a perfect fit. Just as long as he doesnt sing ""On the Road Again."" Executive 2 And Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg? A throwback to the Smokey and the Bandit days? Executive 1 Reynolds? Isnt he dead? Executive 2 Not officially although his recent films have included a co-starring role opposite a bear and a re-make with Adam Sandler. He probably needs money so we might be able to get him cheap. If not we can always try Danny DeVito. Hes the right shape. Executive 1 Reynolds looks better in a white tux. Besides weve already seen DeVito in a penguin suit (Mutual fake laughter.) Executive 1 Who was the guy who did the title song and the voiceovers? Some old time singer. Engelbert Humperdinck? Executive 2 Waylon Jennings. Executive 1 Yeah thats right. See if hes available. Get him if hes not dead. And if he is dead get someone who sounds like him. I want that voiceover to be authentic. Thats what were aiming for - authenticity Realism Car chases with jumps that make the bus acrobatics in Speed look believable Executive 2 When do we release it? Executive 1 August of course. We dont want it going against anything that could be construed as a quality film. Jettison it amidst all the other garbage and people will see it because they recognize the name. The only other choice is February but action films dont do well at that time of the year. Too many people in the north freezing their asses off. Stupid idiots should all move to L.A. Executive 2 I think weve got a winner. A dumb script. A director with few credits. A B-list cast. A cheap editor. A really bad movie with enough action scenes to make a trailer that will get kids to the theater during its first weekend then sell DVDs of the series. Executive 1 Thats the ticket With luck this will garner tons of nominations Executive 2 Oscars?

The movie likewise guns forward at a sustained zigzag. Its trash all right but perfectly skewed trash -- a comedy that knows just how smart to be about just how dumb it is. Bo and Luke who sell jars of moonshine manufactured by their grizzled Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) want nothing more out of life than to fight party race cars and chase curvalicious Dixie chicks. The two are loopy cornpone hedonists devoted to the American dream the pursuit of happiness white-trash yokel style. Somehow though the law has a way of always squashing their freedom and fighting back is no simple trick. It takes lots of schemes and plans; it takes entire convoluted episodes. When Luke with his scuzzy scowl and Bo with his maniacal infantile gleam attempt to break into the safe of Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds a-twinkle with sin) the corrupt commissioner who is plotting to strip-mine Hazzard County its a job as tricky as splitting the atom albeit with somewhat more primitive means. The safe gets dragged by tow truck through the office window then down the road where it smashes a bunch of mailboxes then down the road farther with Luke pulled along on top of it. A few strategically placed explosives along with a flaming arrow finally do the trick but what gives the sequence its nuthouse kick is that its staged with utter demented conviction as the epitome of common sense. In Hazzard County this is how you bust open a safe dammit. By any idiotic means necessary. When it premiered in 1979 The Dukes of Hazzard looked like the final chapter in the schlockification of TV. It drew on the corporate jiggle of Charlies Angels the how-low-can-you-go cheesiness of Fantasy Island but what gave Dukes its unique doltish appeal was the innocuous ease with which it co-opted the dregs of 70s outlaw culture. Bo and Luke may have been Ken dolls in Stetsons but the series which drew on the New South kitsch of CB radios Smokey and the Bandit and the lame-duck aimlessness of the late Jimmy Carter era had the brain-dead temerity to insist that these plastic hicks were true-blue ""rebels."" On TV at least this is what bad-boy insouciance had come to beefcake ciphers with paste-on accents sticking it to the man between station breaks. As a movie The Dukes of Hazzard is more fun than it has any right to be perhaps because its not a cynical hipster campfest. Unlike say the strenuously tongue-in-cheek buddy movie that was fashioned out of Starsky amp; Hutch it doesnt condescend to the original show. It hardly needs to The condescension is built into the material and so the director Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers) out-hips the hipsters by playing it straight italicizing the dopiness ever so slightly letting the throwaway chicanery of The Dukes of Hazzard wink at itself. He makes the chintzy pleasures of one-dimensional storytelling seem like hog-wild innocence rather than an insult. Then too Chandrasekhar kicks up the series sexy energy. The car chases are blissful celebrations of movement and flight cued to the burnt-rubber scorch of 70s Southern-rock chestnuts like the Allman Brothers Bands ""One Way Out"" and Molly Hatchets ""Flirtin With Disaster"" and Scott and Knoxville are a rudely charming pair of low-down freewheelers. When they sneak into a lab at a university in Atlanta pretending to be Japanese science geeks the film cuddles up to racism without quite crossing over into it. Bo and Luke are such ingenuous nitwit tricksters that they turn xenophobia into a half-cocked state of grace. And then of course theres Daisy Duke their perversely wholesome sex-bomb cousin who uses her willowy assets to ease them out of tight spots. On the show Catherine Bach got famous for mainstreaming a disco fashion trend but apart from those butt-cleaving cutoffs she was a flavorless wedge of cheesecake. Jessica Simpson with skin as tawny as melted caramel and a smile of joy to rival Julia Roberts turns Daisy into a vibrantly luscious comic tease. Shes Little Annie Fanny as the worlds most self-mocking Hooters waitress and it will be no surprise if Simpsons star keeps rising long after she has hung up her short shorts.

""Dukes"" faithfully plays like an extended episode of the series albeit with an additional gallon or so of fuel-injected raunchiness. Urban box office appears unpredictable but hicks dont figure to nix this sticks pic. Theres a legitimate philosophical argument about whether the world really needs a ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" movie but assuming that someone was determined to remake this mediocre but iconic TV show this is probably as good as its going to get. Loud silly but kind of lame-brained fun with car chases aplenty ""Dukes"" faithfully plays like an extended episode of the series albeit with an additional gallon or so of fuel-injected raunchiness. Urban box office appears unpredictable but hicks dont figure to nix this sticks pic. Warner Bros. certainly has a bit extra riding on the project having recently paid 17.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the producer of the 1975 film ""Moonrunners"" to clear the path to its release. The more risque content meanwhile has already earned the disapproval of the actor who first played ""Cooter"" for what thats worth. Frankly though there wasnt much to the original program and ""Super Troopers"" director Jay Chandrasekhar (of the comedy team Broken Lizard) has with only a few exceptions largely eschewed revisionist subtext. ""Bewitched"" this isnt. Rather John OBriens script simply juggles and updates elements from the program that made its debut in the 1970s serving up impressive stunt work Jessica Simpson squeezed into Catherine Bachs Daisy Duke shorts (its own kind of special effect) and one big-city road trip to Atlanta that delicately expands the concept -- including how a group of African-American youths responds to a bright-orange car named General Lee with a Confederate flag on it. Other than that its the ol ""Dukes"" on steroids down to the familiar narration and complete disregard for property and authority. Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are closer-than-brothers cousins Bo and Luke Duke two ""good ol boys"" with an appreciation for fast cars and loose women. Living with Uncle Jessie (Willie Nelson) and cousin Daisy (Simpson) they run a moonshine racket and irritate the town-dominating Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) and his corrupt sheriff (M.C. Gainey). After a slow start the modest chassis of a plot takes shape as Hogg orchestrates a high-profile auto race to distract the locals hoping to push through a plan to consolidate his land holdings and strip-mine Hazzard County. That leaves it to the none-too-bright Bo and Luke along with their eccentric pals and relatives to thwart the scheme evade the law and somehow find time for the race in 105 minutes. Chandrasekhar wisely dispenses with any pretensions here realizing its hard to sell narration that calls Boss Hogg ""canny as a fox tough as a badger"" without an unflinching commitment to absurdity. Fortunately he has a world-class doofus in Scott who demonstrated this peculiar but highly marketable gift in the ""American Pie"" movies. Some of the other performances are a little hit-or-miss (particularly wrestling with them darn Southern accents) and there are arid stretches where yet another mad dash along the back roads starts to feel like a hostage situation. Still the unassuming overall approach helps offset those shortcomings -- recognizing that enough leaping Dodge Chargers and interludes like the one involving naughty sorority girls will go a long way with the young-male demo. Its hard not to admire the technical craftsmanship too after seeing how many General Lees were damaged in making the film thanks to an outtakes sequence that perfectly underscores the goofy tone the movie seeks. Beyond stoking appreciation for the stunt driving those closing outtakes provide a reminder that screwball comedy is hard work. In that respect credit ""Dukes of Hazzard"" with managing to make a juvenile romp with free-spirited rednecks go down as smoothly as a slug o moonshine on a hot August night.
