These are the big gags of ""National Lampoons Van Wilder."" A pack of hungry frat brothers chows down on eclairs filled with canine semen; later a prospective med school candidate defecates into a wastebasket in plain view of his interview committee. These are the big gags of ""National Lampoons Van Wilder"" -- the first theatrical release in nearly a decade to feature the possessory credit of the famous humor magazine -- and if they sound familiar thats because theres nary a comic idea in ""Van Wilder"" that isnt ripped off from a recent Farrelly brothers movie. But that doesnt stop ""Van Wilder"" from being very funny provided youre not easily offended. While its onscreen pics strangely likable and only about half as puerile as the average MTV reality series. Theatrical prospects are modest for this niche item but a long life as a video rental (particularly at keg parties) seems assured. Directed by Walt Becker (whose debut feature ""Buying the Cow"" remains on the shelf after the bankruptcy of Destination Films) ""Van Wilder"" is patterned after the raunchy campus-set romps that flourished throughout the 1980s and while pic wont have audiences clamoring for the reissue of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" it is as a revival of the form preferable to either part of the tame ""American Pie"" franchise. Unlike the ""Pie"" pics ""Van Wilder"" doesnt dally around with faux character-building scenes and treacly sentiment; its much more connected to what its target audience really wants to see. It cuts to the chase which in this case is a parade of scatological jokes and bodacious bare-breasted babes. But theres a fundamental innocence to the films hijinx -- ""Van Wilder"" is a titillation a tease -- and the characters here arent nearly as hung-up about validating themselves through sex as the characters in most of todays teen-skewing pics. Pics eponymous protagonist (Ryan Reynolds) is a jocular prankster whos spent most of his seven years at fictional Coolidge College wreaking havoc on stuffy professors and throwing killer parties. Van Wilder is the guy that every university seems to have one of -- the big man on campus who has managed to turn college life into a vocation until Vans corporate exec dad (Tim Matheson who played Otter in ""National Lampoons Animal House"") discovers how much of his money is being siphoned away by Vans ""education"" and decides to cut Van off. As a movie ""Van Wilder"" doesnt possess significantly greater ambition than its protagonist. It never builds on its initial concept in any interesting way despite the obvious potential for an amusing satire on the way colleges make as many people afraid of the real world as they prepare for it. Theres a sketch of a plot here about how the resourceful Van must find a way to get himself back on easy street while fending off the charms of the ace school newspaper reporter (Tara Reid of the ""American Pie"" movies) seeking to write a scandalous expose. And its easy to see pics trajectory from several miles away -- the way that Van will come to learn the value of his potential stop slacking about and live happily ever after. But mostly the film shifts its contrivances to the background and coasts comfortably on its forthright outrageousness and on the chemistry of its two leads. The baby-faced Reynolds is a natural fit for this latter-day Ferris Bueller role; he sells you on his sleek confidence so that when he walks through the womens locker room saying ""Hi"" to everyone and nobody bats an eye you believe this guy could really pull that off. And Reid who looks stunning in a part that requires little else still manages to make her girl Friday routine a cut above. Neither thesp has much to do here but together they have a certain spark and they might be even more winning in a pic where they didnt have to fend off so many projected bodily fluids.

The most remarkable thing about ""National Lampoons Van Wilder"" is that its not nearly as atrocious as the ads would suggest. It doesnt come close to the hilarity of the best movies to carry the National Lampoon banner -- 1978s ""Animal House"" which it aims to emulate and the original ""Vacation"" from 1983. It has all the obligatory gross-out jokes youd expect. But for every stupid gag involving half-naked women or uncontrollable bodily functions theres a clever laugh-out-loud line that sneaks up on you. And Ryan Reynolds as eternal college student Van Wilder is the main reason for the movies sporadic success; hes charming enough to make the weaker material in Brent Goldberg and David T. Wagners script bearable. Van has been a student at the fictional Coolidge College for nearly seven years and he has no plans to graduate. He tools around campus in a customized golf cart and lives in an enormous stylish dorm room. Underclassmen line up around the building to compete for the chance to work as his assistant. Hes such an icon that the star reporter at the school paper Gwen Pearson (Tara Reid) is assigned a feature story on him. Shed rather write articles on important topics like euthanasia even though students dont read them. But when Gwen reluctantly goes after the story she learns that Vans wealthy father has refused to pay his tuition this semester forcing him to work as a party planner to keep himself in school. Naturally because Van is so irresistible Gwen falls for him much to the dismay of her uptight pre-med boyfriend Richard (Daniel Cosgrove). This prompts Richard and his Delta Iota Kappa fraternity brothers to plot their revenge. But Van his best friend (Teck Holmes) and his assistant (Kal Penn) a virginal foreign-exchange student from India are always a step ahead. We know from the start that Van ultimately will face his fears of the real world and that he and Gwen will end up together despite plot contrivances to keep them apart. But even when the movie reaches its dopey formulaic ending its generated enough goodwill that its tolerable. ""National Lampoons Van Wilder"" is rated R for strong sexual content gross humor language and some drug content. Running time 95 minutes.

"National Lampoons Van Wilder washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids National Lampoons Van Wilder Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 5 2002 As the house lights came up after a recent screening of the execrable ""National Lampoons Van Wilder"" a shaken-looking woman observed with remarkable understatement ""There were a couple of things there I could have done without."" I wonder what she was referring to? Could it have been the scene in which collegiate wastrel and B.M.O.C. Van Wilder (bland no-talent Ryan Reynolds making the leap from TVs ""Two Guys and a Girl"") and his band of merry men masturbate a bulldog filling a basket of eclairs with his . . . well you know? Or maybe she meant the scene immediately following in which Vans arch-enemy stuffed-shirt frat boy Richard Bagg (Daniel Cosgrove) eats said eclairs. No it must have been the scene where Richard after having downed a milkshake-size laxative defecates loudly and at great length into a wastepaper basket. Ho ho Funny stuff but not half as funny as the jokes at the expense of the old the fat the infirm foreigners and women. With a plot ostensibly following the exertions of Van a perpetual party-hardy undergrad with 13 semesters (and counting) under his belt to stay in school after his father (Tim Matheson) cuts him off the movie is really just an elaborate excuse to show repeated close-ups of an elephantine dog scrotum a godawful sight gag that director Walt Becker gets more mileage out of than a Honda Insight.

Photo HANDOUT FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 2 Back to Gallery BIG TROUBLE Comedy. Starring Tim Allen Rene Russo Tom Sizemore and Dennis Farina. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Big Trouble"" is an ensemble comedy based on the novel by humorist Dave Barry . It was originally scheduled to be released on Sept. 21 but the Sept. 11 attacks delayed it. Anyone who sees it now will understand why. The picture is a Miami crime story with laughs rather like a cheerfully convoluted Elmore Leonard picture except with no menace no malice and no edge. This is like denatured Leonard cute and forgettable -- except for the one thing about it thats unforgettable Of all the films released since Sept. 11 this is the one that most seems like an artifact from a different time. ""Big Trouble"" revolves around a suitcase containing a nuclear bomb smuggled from an arsenal of the former Soviet Union. The Russian mafia sells it to a sleazy businessman (Stanley Tucci) who is robbed of it by a pair of bumbling crooks. Ultimately the suitcase story ropes in the entire cast -- Rene Russo as an unhappy wife; Dennis Farina as a long-suffering hit man and Tim Allen as a journalist turned advertising man. Its all in fun and to be fair there is some fun. The talented cast and the occasional wisecrack keep the film from caving in. But some movies are just cursed and ""Big Trouble"" is one of them. It satirizes lax airport security and the incompetence of the workers. It contains an airplane hijacking scene played for comedy and also shows an unarmed man taking on the hijackers. Its not that the movie is in bad taste -- how could it be? It was made in innocence. The problem is that its impossible to watch it without being reminded of exactly the sort of thing people go to comedies to forget. Were its mood a bit harsh ""Big Trouble"" might have seemed prescient. The movie even squeezes laughs out of the FBIs denying a foreign suspect his constitutional rights. But because the tone is so light so genial and eager to please the whole enterprise seems the opposite of prescient. It seems naive almost delusional. . This film contains mild violence and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle NATIONAL LAMPOONS VAN WILDER  Comedy. Starring Ryan Reynolds and Tara Reid. Directed by Walt Becker. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . In its 95 minutes of screen time ""National Lampoons Van Wilder"" gives audiences exactly one big spontaneous unambiguous laugh. The other laughs are collaborative by nature Viewers have to force themselves into a certain frame of mind and pretend theyre getting their moneys worth. So the question is . . . how much is that one laugh worth? Normal life presents at least one laugh every 95 minutes and when it doesnt theres always video. So ""Van Wilder"" has to go down as a failed comedy. Its just not enough of a comedy. It tries to be other things too. Between jokes about canine testicles teen suicide deaf people and people unwittingly consuming animal semen ""Van Wilder"" attempts to be a character study and a romance. But its efforts in those directions are halfhearted and borrowed or at least seem that way after the goiter joke. The movies one almost-saving grace is Ryan Reynolds who in the title role has the insouciance and hairline of the young Chevy Chase. Van is the big man on his college campus. He loves it so much he has stayed in school for seven years. Someone should have told him about grad school the respectable way of doing the same thing. The story revolves around two events. Vans dad cuts him off financially forcing Van to raise tuition money as a party organizer. And the school newspaper sends young Gwen (Tara Reid) to do an expose on the perennial student. So the two spend time together and . . . but wait lets not give anything away. When it runs out of ways to be funny ""Van Wilder"" resorts to schmaltz. It wants us to understand Van as a sensitive person the spirit of mirth who brings out the best in people blah blah blah. A vulgar comedy should have the courage of its own vulgarity. Romance and projectile vomiting dont mix. . This film contains nudity and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle TROUBLE EVERY DAY Drama. Starring Vincent Gallo and Beatrice Dalle. Directed by Claire Denis. (Not rated. 99 minutes. In English and in French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) . Vincent Gallo is so creepy in ""Trouble Every Day"" that even in the scene where he gets out of the shower he looks as if he could use a shower. He plays an American physician in Paris whose honeymoon is spoiled by his growing impulse to go cannibal and devour his wife not to mention the French maid and every other woman he finds attractive. This cannibal is particular Theyve got to be cute. The picture was directed by Claire Denis a French filmmaker with an eye for the strange and erotic. But ""Trouble Every Day"" is an artistic flop torpedoed by an idiotic premise and by Denis turgid approach to the story. Denis can do original things with a camera and here and there a distinct moment leaps out but the moments leap from a monotonous and boring void. In ""Trouble Every Day"" the doctor (Vincent Gallo) cant kiss his new wife without having to go off by himself to restrain his cannibalistic impulses. It makes one wonder how the relationship progressed all the way to the altar. In a parallel story line Beatrice Dalle is a French cannibal whose romantic trysts always end with her mouth and face covered with her boyfriends blood. Shes a bad romantic bet. Gallo is peculiar casting to play an ostensibly levelheaded physician with a secret and shameful passion. With his piercing eyes unshaved face and overgrown mustache he looks more like a cannibal than a doctor and his acting -- which in other films has been fiery -- is completely opaque. The movie might have benefited from the casting of a Greg Kinnear type someone who could conceivably pass himself off as an amiably bland professional. Denis knows how to film a sex scene for maximum erotic effect placing the camera close up an inch or two away from the skin where a lovers eyes would be. But here the love scenes all end in someone screaming. Maybe theres a metaphor here but figuring it out wouldnt make ""Trouble Every Day"" any better. . This film contains nudity strong language and graphic violence. -- Mick LaSalle TEDDY BEARS PICNIC Comedy. Starring Ming Na Fred Willard and Henry Gibson. Directed by Harry Shearer. (Not rated. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""Teddy Bears Picnic"" is a limp satire of the Bohemian Grove the Northern California summer retreat that attracts some of the most powerful men in politics business and entertainment. Harry Shearer who wrote and directed brings together a host of talented comic actors but never finds much to do with them. The satire is unfocused while the story goes nowhere. Too bad. The material is ripe for satire. Shearer identifies some Bohemian Grove types but he doesnt go much past that. Henry Gibson exudes a creepy decadence as a broken-down old billionaire named Clifford Sloane. Look into his eyes and you can almost see the toxic waste dumps the sweat shops the lives destroyed. Fred Willard has one or two amusing moments as a conservative senator hoping to make a run for the presidency. Others play types derived less from observation than from previous satires. For example theres George Wendt as a gung-ho Air Force general a warmed-over version of George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove."" Shearer who co-starred in ""This Is Spinal Tap"" makes a few feints in the direction of a story involving a newscaster (nicely played by Ming Na) and a plan to smuggle video footage out of Zambesi Glen as the retreat is called here. Nothing comes of it. The movie ends with the audience still waiting for the plot to kick in. Shearer did research on the Bohemian Grove and yet failed to capture the distinct nature of the Bohemian banter. Anyone who has ever spent 10 minutes with these guys knows its harsh -- lots of hostility disguised as friendliness or friendliness disguised as banter. These fellows have a mode of communication unto themselves. Shearer did however notice the other thing that the guys with the most money tell the funniest jokes. . This film contains adult language and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 3 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 4 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 5 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 6 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 9 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 10 The Latest Trump slams Clinton over radical Islam Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News 4 Sierra plane crash victims were from Tuolumne County Family to sue Oakland over mans fatal shooting by police Police Vallejo woman run over by man who stole her car Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed Apple CEO to host fundraiser for Hillary Clinton E.

National Lampoons Van Wilder Movie Review (2002) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/national-lampoons-van-wilder-2002,200,nationallampoon'svanwilder7,nationallampoon'svanwilder,rogerebert
"USATODAY.com - Van Wilder hits new lows Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/04/2002 - Updated 0413 PM ET Van Wilder hits new lows By Claudia Puig USA TODAY National Lampoons Van Wilder (out of four) Stars Ryan Reynolds Tara Reid Rating R for strong sexual content gross humor language and some drug content This movie is aimed at those like the fun-loving Wilder himself kids with plenty of discretionary income lots of extra time and no sense of direction. Or taste. Even by teen gross-out movie standards Van Wilder makes Sorority Boys look like Some Like It Hot. Ryan Reynolds plays Van Wilder and looks like a cross between Tim Matheson and Ben Affleck. Sadly he doesnt have the charm or talent of either. In fact Matheson plays his dad no doubt to evoke his far superior National Lampoon rowdy-fest Animal House. The makers of Van Wilder would have us believe that a mid-size university has only one big man on campus. As that hard-partying BMOC Wilder is on the seven-year plan. His businessman dad keeps sending checks so Wilder lives a cushy life complete with souped-up golf cart and full-time assistant a horny lad from India. Gwen an earnest college reporter (the ever-bland Tara Reid at her bimbo best) is dispatched to do an expose on Wilder. Of course the two spark a romance but not until after schoolchildren are forced to guzzle booze and fraternity guys ingest dog semen in gooey sweet rolls. The Farrelly brothers have pulled off this kind of foul fare much more cleverly in Theres Something About Mary. The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ""uhhh"" which is better than most of the writing in the movie.
