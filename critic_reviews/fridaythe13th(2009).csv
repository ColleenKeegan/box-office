Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Arbitrary Brutality Katyn Andrzej Wajdas morally dizzying vision of WWII Poland is also a tribute to his father. By David Edelstein Published Feb 15 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Kock Lorber Films and Film Forum) Watching Andrzej Wajdas unnervingly even-tempered Katyn you wonder why the Poles who managed to live through World War II and the dual occupation of the Germans and Soviets did not go mad Survival and sanity appear to be mutually exclusive. The movie is named for the forest where in 1940 the Soviets secretly executed 15000 Polish officers artists educators intellectualsthe best and brightest among them the 14-year-old Wajdas father. The overture is out of the Theatre of the Absurd. Its 1939 and two waves of civilians mostly women and children surge onto opposite ends of a bridge and collide in the middle One group screams that the Nazis are behind them the other that the Bolshies are behind them. Do they go forward? Backward? They cant stay put. In the pandemonium people push past one another in both directions while Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) grabs her little daughter and heads for the park where the Soviets have detained her husband Andrzej (Artur Zmijewski) and other officers. She begs him to flee; he says he must be true to his military pledge and remain with his soldiers. Andrzej the obvious stand-in for Wajdas father cant figure out why hes a POW. Of his Soviet captors he says There was no war with them In his early eighties Wajda finally tells the story that has haunted much of his work which began with the tumultuous war trilogy of A Generation (1954) Kanal (1957) and Ashes and Diamonds (1958). There are two likely reasons why he didnt make Katyn after those films (1) The Communists late-fifties tolerance for moral and artistic complexity was short-lived and (2) the Soviets attributed the Katyn massacre to the Nazis and were touchy when correctedi.e. they shot people. The vanquished Germans having liquidated a significant number of Europeans could hardly mount a credible defense. Wajda does not tell this story from the perspective of the child he was but there is something childlike about the movies lack of context. What I mean is No one spells out why bad things are happening to bewildered people. We know of course why the Nazis haul people off An SS man labels professors who naively gather to discuss academic freedom hostile to Germany and thats the last anyone sees of them. But why do the Soviets come for men women and children? Andrzej his lieutenant Jerzy (Andrzej Chyra) and their general (Jan Englert) stand around a frigid barracks overseen by blank-faced Soviet guards; no one in power speaks to them. This is a vacuuman indifferent universe only fleetingly warmed by their prayers and songs. To make sense of what we see we have to go outside the film to know that even as Stalin was gearing up to fight Hitler he was thinking about the corrosive effect of independent thinkers on Poland a country he planned to rule through Communist apparatchiks. It was less trouble to clean house before he fully moved in. The arbitrary brutal suppression of knowledge of culture of ones system of values of ones very history The themethe vacuumis central to so much of postwar Polish fiction and drama; it is central to even the Jewish perspective of Roman Polanskis The Pianist. (There are no Jews in Katyn however.) In Wajdas film Anna and her daughter barely escape a Soviet roundup and flee to German-ruled Krakow where they are safer. They scan the newspaper and listen to readings of the list of the Polish dead in the city squarepraying fervently that Andrzej wont be on it. What actually happened to her husband and others only sees the light for propagandas sake. The Nazis document the exhumation of the Katyn corpses on film as proof that the Soviets are worse than they are. They express their sincere condolences to the late generals wife (Danuta Stenka) then ask her to read a denunciation of the USSR. When she demurs they ask her again more insistently then raise the possibility of Auschwitz What should she do? Determining the costbenefit ratiothe Soviets would have killed her already and did kill her husband but the Nazis are killing Poles and the Polish resistance could kill her for collaborating and the Soviets might win the war and eliminate her but she could be put on a train to Auschwitz that dayrequires the higher math. The last section of Katynafter the waris less morally dizzying. The stakes are stark Accept the Soviet version of Katyn and live fatally compromised or broadcast the truth and die. A couple of idealistic young peoplea man and a womandemonstrate their resolve to reject the counterfeit history The film does not end with them hoisted aloft by cheering crowds. I confess that at times I agreed with the reluctant compromisers the ones who said You cant bring back the Katyn dead. Dont get yourself killed. Live until Poland is free again. Wajda at least gives those people dignity. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Some of the gentlest folk we know are horror fans. And they dont dig just any old terrorizing flick but gravitate to those of the slasher-gore variety. Take Keith Garcia programming manager at the Denver Film Society. With his quiet manner his easy laugh he can make you feel like the best stand-up comic around.Thursday nights you might find him introducing a DocNight film at the Starz FilmCenter with geeky aplomb. Yet his favorite moment at the last Starz Denver Film Festival was the night ""the first Jason"" -- Ari Lehman -- attended the premiere of the documentary ""His Name Was Jason 30 Years of Friday the 13th."" That event says Garcia with glee ""was a celebration of a young man with a lot of moxie and a machete."" So when producer Michael Bays ""Friday the 13th"" landed on the release schedule (it opens today natch) the horror aficionado was an obvious choice to tag team a review with an admitted horror-crank. Like 2003s Bay-produced ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" redux (also directed by Marcus Nispel) and Rob Zombies ""Halloween"" remake this movie returns to the original -- now 30 years old -- in a slick attempt to mine fresh frights. Small-screen hotties star as naughty nubile fodder. Aaron Yoo has the best scenes as a stoned rube rummaging a tool shed in classic ""dont flipping go in there"" fashion. At our/their peril audiences can pull for Clay and Jenna played by Jared Padalecki (""Gilmore Girls"") and Danielle Panabaker (""Shark""). A fine prescreening moment came when a guy returned to his row at the packed theater. ""Thought you got scared and left"" said his friend. ""I did"" he replied. ""Started crying like a girl and ran."" Later the frat dude with the keys to his daddys Escalade and run of a swank cabin (far too near Camp Crystal Lake) screams in just that way. While Garcia and the crank will never see eye to eye on the pleasures and ethics of splatter we did agree on one thing Denver Post Theres nothing like a script handing you the pan on a blood-soaked platter. Garcia You mean when that couple walks into the ruins of Camp Crystal Lake and says ""Look how old this (expletive) is. Looks like its been dragged here from another century""? DP Exactly. This film is so last-century. Garcia You can go back to that formula once or twice and its all right. But when a series is 12 installments in -- with Jason going to hell fighting Freddy Krueger and going to outer space -- you gotta come back with something else. DP One suspects the only reason filmmakers return to these old slashers is to make them more ""realistic"" using an infinitely better bag of makeup and F/X tricks. Still it was a relief that it wasnt as much of a ""snuff"" film as feared. Garcia My question with these projects is why does it have to be so shiny? Theres a grunginess to the originals that was itself scary. DP You mentioned ""good gore."" What is that? Garcia Good gore doesnt necessarily mean an interesting kill but a believable shock. DP Theres not a one ""I didnt see that coming"" moment in this flick. Garcia I cant believe Im saying this but one of my favorite kills -- and a fan favorite -- takes place in the sequel ""Part VII The New Blood"" after Jasons been dispatching people right and left with machetes and an ax. Theres a girl whos just had sex in a tent. He drags her 30 feet then beats her while shes still in the sleeping bag to death against a tree. Now I love that because it makes you go ""Whyd you do that? What did she do to incur that rage? Why so serious Jason Vorhees?"" I didnt enjoy Rob Zombies ""Halloween"" but at least he tried to get at the heart of the matter Did something happen to cause Michael Myers to have the devils eyes to be evil? This movie tries to make you comfortable. Heres Jason. Heres Crystal Lake. Here are stupid teenagers. Here are boobs. Heres a machete twice as long as it needs to be. DP Critics of this genre often liken its structure to porn. Only the next kill becomes the next money shot. The director plays with that criticism making the interrupted coitus soft core. But I dont recall drugs marijuana in this case figuring into the old films so much. Garcia There were never too many drugs. But if there was a pot-smoking hippie hed be one of the first to go. DP Watch out Michael Phelps.Is there some reason why audiences deserve something so unimaginative? Garcia Im much happier being disturbed by a film like Eli Roths ""Hostel"" than being disturbed by an audiences complete acceptance of the same dish theyve been served over and over again. DP Is this genre played out? Garcia You know theres a wonderful new slasher called ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"" that hasnt come out yet -- though it probably will this summer. It has the feel of an 80s Sean Cunningham-produced ""Friday the 13th"" movie but takes the stalk-and-slash and gives it an entirely different weight. Its actually about something. It has a couple of dramatic twists that are probable and interesting to the whole notion of horror and gender. Best Its fun. DP So I dont often get to ask this of others. How many stars would you give this? Garcia I would give it (pause) one star. For boring me to tears when it should have made me scream. ""Friday the 13th"" R for strong bloody violence some graphic sexual content language and drug material. 1 hour 38 minutes. Directed by Marcus Nispel; written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift; photography by Daniel C. Pearl; starring Jared Padalecki Danielle Panabaker Aaron Yoo Amanda Righetti Travis Van Winkle Derek Mears Arlen Scarpeta. Opens today at area theaters.

"Movie review Friday the 13th -- 1 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Friday the 13th -- 1 out of 5 stars Jared Padalecki Warner Bros. Jared Padalecki Jared Padalecki (Warner Bros.) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Lets celebrate Friday the 13th with a little red meat shall we? And hard numbers.There are 13 grisly deaths in the re-boot of Friday the 13th -- machete decapitations an arrow through the head somebody burned to death in a sleeping bag -- you know the slasher drill. The murders are for shock and comic effect. Three nubile young things take their tops off. Two of them have hot sex with not-nearly-as-naked guys in the same forest by the same Crystal Lake where all those camp counselors were butchered back in 1980.This Michael Bay production is a graphic homage to the series that helped turn simple slasher pictures into a formula for success. It may have Bays big-budget sheen and its every bit as efficient and heartless as the original Fridays. But for all its attempted jolts its not all that scary. The genre is reduced to ""Who gets it next and how?"" and never for a second makes us care. For the opening were treated to a blameless quintet of pot lovers murdered after they come to the ruined Camp Crystal Lake because theres weed growing there. ""Six weeks later"" we meet a new group of seven young people on a beer-and-booze blast at the rich boys daddys cabin. A hunky biker (Jared Padalecki) is looking for his missing sister (she was in the first five). Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) wants to leave her sex shots skiing and bong-hitting friends to help him find her.The difference between the worst slasher film ever and the best one is about as wide as a machete blade. They all turn bloody horrific murders into comic sport all feature faceless soulless masked (hockey etc.) slashers and all have plot holes so big you could drive a Zamboni through them.Friday the 13th has no more room for ""feeling"" or ""fearing"" than My Bloody Valentine. At least last months slasher re-boot had 3D. Friday skimps on suspense and cuts straight to the beheadings. We may feel worried for a second when an actor we recognize (Aaron Yoo from Disturbia still playing college potheads at 30) wanders into a workshop filled with cutting tools and sharp objects. Only for a second though.We can laugh at the GPS/iPod nerd (Jonathan Sadowski) who sings ""Motoring"" at the top of his lungs in the middle of the forest and see that hell be the first to die -- its only right. But with every cheap scare every surly three-toothed local every random moment of nudity (topless water skiing theres a resume skill) Friday the 13th feels more quaint. For all its social ills there is one good that came from Hostel and its torture-porn cousins. The simple ""slasher"" formula doesnt cut it any more.The only terror here is that this Friday will be a hit and Friday the 13th will enjoy another decade as the unluckiest day of the year for horror fans.

Johnson Warner Bros. Pictures Still at large Killer Jason (Derek Mears) lurks behind Bree (Julianna Guill) in the franchises latest. ABOUT THE MOVIEFriday the 13th 1/2 (out of four)Stars Jared Padalecki Danielle Panabaker Aaron YooDirector Marcus NispelDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for strong bloody violence some graphic sexual content language and drug materialRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Perhaps theres not much that can be done beyond the expected with the Friday the 13th franchise. But it would have been fun to see someone try. The latest Friday the 13th has the requisite scares jolts nudity debauchery and gruesome murders. This time its all set in a world of iPods cellphones and Girls Gone Wild. But nothing much has changed. Even the latest GPS device proves useless up against the maniacal determination of hockey-mask-wearing super-killer Jason Voorhees. More importantly nothing has changed to enliven or expand the formulaic concept. This is certainly not the movie to propel the slasher genre forward. While it may sound strange to suggest such a thing think of 2002s 28 Days Later. Director Danny Boyle took a predictable zombie concept and with unusual camera angles a clever script and strong performances made it feel somehow new and more terrifying. While its billed as a ""re-imagining"" of the horror franchise this Friday is more like a rehash delivering just what you expect and nothing more. Jared Padalecki (Supernatural) is fine as the good guy in search of a sister who has mysteriously disappeared during a camping trip at Crystal Lake. And Danielle Panabaker is equally sympathetic in the role of ""nice girl."" This is usually determined not so much by a kind disposition as by not hooking up at the drop of a er bra. Those who bare their breasts are usually the first to go along with the most avid pot smokers or most enthusiastic drinkers. The well-worn morality of horror slasher flicks remains intact. One of the more likable characters is played by Aaron Yoo (Disturbia) who is there for diversity as well as comic relief. Hes easily the funniest guy and gets punished in a particularly grisly way for it. Director Marcus Nispel seems to be in the business of remaking horror icons his last effort being 2003s equally unimaginative The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This version like the others before it panders directly to a teenage or twentysomething audience that embraces the cheesiness and goes simply to see the latest in impaling beheading and butchering techniques. At least they know what theyre in for. Friday the 13th may be gory enough to please some fans. But its witless story adds nothing new to the franchise. The story has been pulled from its shallow grave but not at all reinvigorated. Rather its been dusted off and repackaged for the sole purpose of raking in millions from foolish audiences.

Director Marcus Nispel. (135) R Extreme violence gore nudity drug use language. At area theaters. What can you say about a 29-year-old monster who died and died and still came back again? That he was ugly and deranged and loved piercing people with axes and arrows and machetes that looked like samurai weapons? It doesnt matter whats said about Jason because the new ""Friday the 13th"" gives modern horror fans what someone thinks they want shock-cuts nudity and blood always so much blood. If we (foolishly) consider that the original few ""Friday the 13th"" movies worthy of dissection it becomes clear Jason wasnt as complex as his contemporaries Michael ""Halloween"" Myers and Freddy ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" Krueger. The killers-eye viewpoint and kill-the-promiscuous-teens morality werent very original. Even Jasons origin -- undead son of a woman who slashed counselors where he supposedly drowned -- was ""Psycho""-lite. He came into his own as a murderer in part II (1981) and found his beloved hockey mask in 1982s part III. This new ""reimagining"" -- produced like the remakes of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" by Michael Bay as apparently a sort of regression therapy -- shows Mom during the credits then sets up all the comely teens to fall. The girls act like porn stars the guys are potheads or playas and anyone bending down and standing up again gets decapitated. Thats the gist of it; theres no decadent spark or even gutter-joy to be had. Plus the virgin inexplicably buys it first and theres no killer POV. Purists will be - happy? Relieved? - to know that the ""ch-ch-chhh"" music survived and the body count still totals 13. Soul-deadening homage thy name is Jason.

Youd have to go back to Phnom Penh in 1975 to find a place with a higher per-capita rate of unprosecuted homicides. Twenty-nine sticky red years later the 12th ""Friday the 13th"" reboots and rewrites the story of the second-vilest person to be associated with hockey (after Sean Avery). This time five horny pot-loving contemporary teens are on a camping trip near the Camp Crystal Lake site that they tell each other was the scene of some seriously messed-up stuff - back in 1980 the year the original movie came out. Since the 1980 events were just a follow-up to the believed drowning of the boy Jason Voorhees in 1957 Jason is now on the AARP mailing list. Its no mystery what keeps him young a vigorous exercise regimen that includes archery the 50-yard hatchet toss and fencing with a machete. Who says there are no movies about mature characters? Eight more young partyers come into the picture not campers but luxury vacationers staying in an expensive chalet. That puts the cast population at 13 including one black guy (I didnt catch his characters name but I think it was Comedy Relief Element No. 1) and one Asian (CRE No. 2). The white people get abundant nooky. The black guy is reduced to seeking shall we say solo erotic inspiration in what looks like a Sears catalog. The Asian dude we can safely assume will take his virginity to the grave. With so many cuts of meat awaiting butchering there isnt much time to establish everyones personal character and back story. A blond guy (Travis Van Winkle) manages to build a convincing case for himself as the tool (hes always telling the others not to spill beer on his precious stained floors yet goes along with the general desire to play beer pong) while another (Jared Padalecki) is driven by the conviction that he will someday find his missing sister (Amanda Righetti). The rest are just faces in the crowd. Director Marcus Nispel makes no attempt to have the movie be about anything other than earsplitting noises and skullsplitting machetes. Many of the death scenes will have the young-male demo chortling with glee but the gruesomeness will probably turn the stomachs of a lot of girls and young women. ""Friday the 13th"" goes as deep into the R rating as Jasons blades go into brains torsos and throats. The effect is however completely forgettable except for one excellent line. Let me save you 12 A guy who is playing with a hockey stick in the toolshed asks Jason ""Are you looking for this? Because it uh completes your outfit."" FRIDAY THE 13TH Splatter wince repeat.

Pictures release. Photo John P. Johnson Warner Brothers Movie review Friday the 13th remake a dud 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Friday the 13th Horror. Starring Jared Padalecki Danielle Panabaker and Amanda Righetti. Directed by Marcus Nispel. (R. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Hopefully theres something in President Obamas stimulus package that will help the ailing slasher-movie industry. Not only are horror filmmakers running out of ideas for this genre but they cant even remake the old ones with any skill. The reboot of the ""Friday the 13th"" series is a pretty big mess - not particularly scary or interesting or even gory by 21st century movie standards. The makers of this film have removed the handful of redeeming qualities from the original and added rejected subplots from ""7th Heaven"" and ""The O.C."" where most of the cast members seem to have been recruited. If it wasnt for a topless waterskiing sequence there would be nothing memorable to recommend to your friends. Its not as if director Marcus Nispel had an especially difficult task making a movie that equaled the original. ""Friday the 13th"" released in 1980 was an inferior knock-off of John Carpenters ""Halloween."" The makers of the first ""Friday"" didnt have a better story or technical skills than Carpenter so they ramped up the sex gore and depravity. Their one genius idea was accessorizing Jason with a hockey mask. The best part about the original ""Friday"" was the chance for teen moviegoers to defy their parents and the critics who had declared a national crisis because of the horror picture. If Siskel and Ebert spent an entire show trashing the movie then we have to see it Ten sequels later including the ""Freddy vs. Jason"" movie its hard to generate much outrage for this series re-launch which despite several decapitations and impaled heads seems tame in the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" era. ""Friday the 13th"" has enough credited writers to field a hockey team and each of them was able to contribute one-third of a good idea. (In addition to the topless waterskiing scene theres some inventive use of a wood chipper.) ""Friday the 13th"" begins with a short and grainy scene involving the history of Jason his mother and Camp Crystal Lake. After Jason takes out several campers in a second pre-credit sequence we move ahead to present day where a strapping young Josh Brolin look-alike (Jared Padalecki) searches for his sister. Of course he runs into Jason who also terrorizes a group of college students staying in the vacation house of a rich kid. Notice that you didnt see the words ""camp counselors"" once? Creating a ""Friday the 13th"" movie without counselors is like making a ""Godfather"" movie without any mobsters. But these filmmakers try anyway filling the story instead with modern product placement - including GPS devices a Cadillac Escalade and an underground dungeon that looks like it was made by the same subcontractors responsible for Jame Gumbs lair in ""Silence of the Lambs."" Both groups of machete fodder are made up of five or six stereotyped young people who couldnt possibly be friends in real life the spoiled wealthy kid the pot-smoking tech nerd the black guy who wants to start a rap label the sensible girl who keeps complaining that everyone should turn around and drive home ...

Friday the 13th Jasons back and its not so bad | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentFriday the 13th Jasons back and its not so badThe most accomplished of all movie spree-killers Jason Voorhees has struck upon a novel method of luring unwary youngsters to his killing grounds at Camp Crystal Lake plant a field of marijuana.Theres no escaping Jason Voorhees as Jared Padaleckis Clay discovers in the 11th instalment of Friday the 13th.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. Feb. 13 2009Starring Jared Padalecki Danielle Panabaker and Travis Van Winkle. Directed by Marcus Nispel. 97 minutes. At major theatres. 18A The most accomplished of all movie spree-killers Jason Voorhees has struck upon a novel method of luring unwary youngsters to his killing grounds at Camp Crystal Lake plant a field of marijuana. The latest instalment of the most successful horror franchise of all-time begins with a group of bud-seeking kids finding out the hard way that pot use can have fatal results - especially if a guy in a hockey mask shows up to harsh your buzz. Alas young people always fail to heed lessons like that which is why Jason has rarely been hard up for victims in the Friday the 13th movies of which this entry is the 11th (12th if you count his matchup with Freddy Krueger in 2003s Freddy Vs. Jason). Article Continued BelowWhats surprising about this particular Friday the 13th is that its not half bad. As retooled by Michael Bays production company - which has already recycled such vintage scary-movie properties as Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Amityville Horror - it achieves the very modest goal of improving on most of its predecessors. Not only does this one wrest some fresh thrills from a tired formula it does so largely without resorting to the more sadistic style prevalent in contemporary horror. In other words the movie emphasizes the chasing and the killing not the suffering which makes its brand of mayhem easier to take than the degradations that dominate the Saw cycle. But then Jason has always been a traditionalist at heart. He also remains impossible to kill which is bad news both for Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) the brother of a missing young woman who was one of the unlucky pot-hunters and for a fresh batch of ill-fated hotties partying at a cottage near Crystal Lake. Scenes of binge drinking and topless wakeboarding provide respites from the requisite series of gory murders. Besides deploying the genres usual devices (e.g. cellphones with no reception faulty flashlights swift punishment for the horny) the movie also makes good on the old stage adage that if a wood chipper is introduced in the first act it will be used in the third. This will never be everyones idea of fun but Friday the 13th goes about its business with brisk efficiency and sufficient intensity. Faithfully adhering to the precepts of the slasher flick it might even seem honourable if it werent so disreputable.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The body count continues as will other grosses in ""Friday the 13th"" a by-the-numbers remake of the crudely elemental slasher whose 80s and 90s sequels made a half-billion-dollar killing for Paramount worldwide. Resurrected by ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" revampers Michael Bay and director Marcus Nispel hockey-mask-sporting mother-grieving psycho Jason Voorhees here butchers not one but two batches of nubile young things who unwittingly share his stomping grounds at Camp Crystal Lake aka Camp Blood. While it wont scare up ""Chainsaw"" figures ""13th"" will be a lucky number for Warners domestically and somewhat less so for Paramount relegated to international rollout. Sick as it sounds the pics word-of-mouth success will pivot on the creativity of the murders -- which are aptly repugnant if nowhere near ingenious particularly not by ""Saw"" standards. To say the new film is better shot and cut than those barebones gorefests of the Reagan era is to say nothing much as even series fans would agree and Nispels movie is only marginally clever in its relation to producer-director Sean S. Cunninghams 1980 ""original"" (itself a rip-off of ""Halloween""). Pic opens in that year on June 13 (a Tuesday but whatever) with sweet young Whitney (Amanda Righetti) decapitating Mrs. Voorhees who had slain camp counselors she believed responsible for the drowning death of her son Jason (Derek Mears) -- still alive as it turns out. Thus the bulk of the pic (whose title appears more than 20 minutes in) covers the basic territory of 1981s ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" wherein the deformed Jason takes his own revenge on Mommys killer and other sexy college-age kids like her. These include a half-dozen sex- and pot-loving campers at Crystal Lake and Whitneys chopper-riding brother Clay (""Supernatural"" hunk Jared Padalecki) who goes looking for his sis and eventually finds her held captive in Jasons absurdly elaborate underground tunnel lair. After several murders on the property expertly handled with bow and arrow bear trap hatchet and machete Jason gets inside the cabin and goes to work on eliminating the remaining survivors. The killings are not all instantaneous as before befitting the torture-porn genre in which victims are made to suffer. As in his ""Chainsaw"" remake Nispels scare tactics amount to little more than carefully timed cattle-prod shocks aided by high-volume speaker blasts that were beyond the budgetary reach of the early 80s films. Shot in and around Austin Texas the pic peaks early with a waterskiing interlude gone bad as Nispel along with d.p. Daniel C. Pearl and editor Ken Blackwell appear psyched to invoke the horror of other franchise pics namely ""Jaws"" and its first sequel. Pastiche-laden screenplay by ""Freddy vs. Jason"" scribes Damian Shannon and Mark Swift includes of all things a marijuana-laced homage to Lauren Bacalls ""Put your lips together"" line from Howard Hawks ""To Have and Have Not."" Sadly ""Friday"" series in-jokes are few and far between though roads to future sequels are surely paved. Aesthetically Nispels ""Friday"" is slightly stronger than his mediocre ""Chainsaw"" if essentially identical. Pearls widescreen lensing appears professional but woefully lacking in nuance and detail -- which given the flatness of the first ""Fridays"" may in fact be one of the more faithful elements of the adaptation. Standouts in the young cast include Danielle Panabaker who has the fresh-faced appeal of the young Winona Ryder and Aaron Yoo who lends much-needed comic flair to the part of a playfully goofy Cheech-esque stoner. Harry Manfredinis original ""ch-ch/pa-pa"" theme is used here but sparingly perhaps in acknowledgment that the murders are telegraphed plenty well enough as is. Steve Jablonskys score also is quicker than Manfredinis in keeping with the killers curiously aerobic agility. Friday the 13thProductionA Warner Bros.

Friday the 13th shares a grungy competent vibe with that previous effort as Derek Mears Jason sets about dispatching the large number of folks who make the mistake of smoking marijuana or flashing their mammaries in the vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake. True the characters often act in unbelievable and downright suicidal ways. ""Wheres he going?"" ponders Jared Padelecki upon first espying a corpse-carrying Mr. Voorhees. (Really thats the question? Not ""How the blue blazes do we get out of here?""). However this film is (be)head and shoulders above the recently reanimated likes of Prom Night and My Bloody Valentine.

Cunninghams original film was released.But todays kids are infinitely more cynical crude rude and entitled than their scruffy naive predecessors.The new kids on the lake also dress better drive nicer cars and have ridiculously well-toned doll-like bodies they love to show off.This makes it so much more satisfying to watch them die.Director Marcus Nispel who created an unexpectedly inventive and respectful homage to Tobe Hooper with his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake does a fine job. The film which is not a remake but the 11th sequel is a lean mean highly efficient and rapidly moving scare-fest that packs plenty of gory whoop.As Jason sequels go this is one of the best though thats not saying much considering the last batch which included Jason Takes Manhattan Jason Goes to Hell (why didnt he stay?) Jason X (wherein our intrepid bad guy goes into space) and the ludicrously lame bad-guy showdown Freddy vs. Jason.But Nispel is no Rob Zombie - who achieved something akin to brilliance with his 2007 Halloween remake. Whats more as influential as its been Friday the 13th was never that great.Nispels ride on the Jason merry-go-round which so far has made 374 million worldwide begins with a clever double prologue the first of which restages the ending of the 1980 flick.Then were treated to a 20-minute mini-sequel. An older wiser Jason dispatches four out of five campers who are searching for a crop of marijuana growing wild near Camp Crystal Lake.Whitney (Amanda Righetti) one of just two girls in the film who keep their tops on survives - but is taken back to Jasons lair. (The lair adds a touch of Chainsaw Massacre.)After this round of bloody killings Nispel finally flashes the title card. (The theater which is full of fans explodes with applause.)The story proper begins when Whitneys brother Clay Miller (adequately played by Supernatural star Jared Padalecki) enlists the help of a group of vacationing kids to look for his sister.You know the rest More girls die promptly after taking off their tops and more boys die promptly after being mean to Clay.Contact staff writer Tirdad Derakhshani at 215-854-2736 or tirdadphillynews.com.

Friday the 13th"" as restaged for 2009 connects to this time and place only tangentially. The kids play beer pong. They go speed-boating. They wear ""Star Wars"" T-shirts giant cargo shorts and flip-flops and go foraging for weed. They still urinate alone in the forest and have loud sex in a tent. If they know theyre a cliche theyre helpless to stop acting like one. But we know which makes it hard to freak out over their safety.Our future victims do seem to know the myth of Crystal Lake where in 1980 the mother of a boy who drowned massacres a group of camp counselors. In countless subsequent sequels the son would become immortalized as Jason Voorhees the serial killer in a goalies mask who by the time of 1989s ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" had devolved into a summer-camp camp star.Still these new kids are obliged to endanger themselves for us. But when a 6-foot-5 260-pound machete-wielding man can get close enough to breathe on you its more hilarious than terrifying. Everyones hearing appears to have vanished along with their cellphone reception. If Jason could talk his one line would be ""Can you hear me now?"" The most interesting innovation in this new ""Friday the 13th"" is the possibility that the slasher film could pass for a reality-television show. Through reductive editing generic people become interchangeable types without ever approaching actual personhood. Its ""The Hills"" ""Bromance"" ""The Real World"" and ""Rock of Love"" with a body count. Indeed ""Friday the 13th"" gives us two seasons of this show. Once Jason hacks his way through one group of stupid horny good-looking kids he gets a fresh batch a scene later - this time with two tokens of color and a moody white hero looking for the sister who vanished in batch one. (The camera enjoys lingering on the vein in his biceps as much it does all the jiggling C-cups.)The movie might have worked if it winked more - or if it played things completely straight. Director Marcus Nispel also coughed up a 2003 version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" that seemed to miss what was so frightening about the original of that film too an atmosphere of pervasive dread. For all the amateurishness of the original ""Friday the 13th"" there was also more than a little psycho-social subtext. It was the rare slasher film where a woman deranged as she was slayed for a reason. She was a reverse Norman Bates - mother killing for son. Some recent filmmakers have gamely outfitted their movies with topical girding that gives the mayhem and gruesomeness somewhere to go and someplace youd want to follow. ""28 Days Later"" and its sequel ""The Signal"" ""The Descent"" even the appalling ""Frontier(s)"" are recent examples of horror that had a scrap of wit and ambition. The films respected their genre even as they challenged its limits.All Nispel does is repackage whats been hot recently in horror. The slayings here are indistinguishable from the atrocities of ""Saw"" and ""Hostel."" His psychological scars lasered away Jason now kills for sport. Like the filmmakers our bogeyman is merely a copycat hack. And for those of you watching the box office he continues to serve a far grimmer end Hes still just an ATM.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Johnson John P. Johnson Jason (Derek Mears right) crashes through a window and grabs Clay (Jared Padalecki left) in ""Friday the 13th."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Considering the countless cold-blooded murders that Jason Voorhees has committed over the past 30 years in the spirit of Valentines Day its worth remembering he originally began slaughtering people out of adoring love -- albeit for his mother but love nonetheless. Now a full dozen movies after the original ""Friday the 13th"" the hockey-mask-wearing maniac returns in whats being cleverly marketed as a ""reboot"" of the franchise instead of a remake of the original film. Produced by Michael Bay and directed by Marcus Nispel (the same team behind 2003s failed ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake) this new installment boasts plenty of topless women and gory violence but little in the way of actual horror. Having traveled in recent films to such exotic locales as hell the future and Manhattan Jason is comfortably back home at Camp Crystal Lake. Disturbing his Walden Pond-like retreat -- where he no doubt fishes daily and enjoys living ""green"" -- is yet another group of sexually charged alcohol-fueled twenty-somethings. It remains unclear why people continue to spend weekends at a place known almost exclusively for its frequent bloody massacres but if you wonder about details like that ""Friday the 13th"" is probably not your kind of movie. For his part Jason has been hard at work developing some impressive murdering techniques (now a skilled archer and hatchet thrower he might consider competing in ESPNs ""Great Outdoor Games"") although he still has a knack for patiently standing in silence behind his victims for three seconds before butchering them with his trusty machete. Loyal fans of the ""Friday the 13th"" series will probably appreciate these attempts at recapturing Jasons original character and they may even find this new installment to be the best in the past two decades. But to acquire a new generation of fans it should be either horrifying or hilarious and this ""Friday the 13th"" is ultimately neither.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Eventually some enterprising filmmaker will cut right to the chase and make Sudden Shocks The Movie an entirely context-free feature-length compendium of loud noises and scary things moving abruptly into frame. Until then people who go to the movies primarily to be startled can make do with the new Friday The 13th an insistently pointless series reboot from the director of Pathfinder and the 2003 Texas Chain Saw Massacre remake. Its almost charming in its sheer lack of ambition but the lack of creativity in its by-the-numbers shocks is harder to excuse. Nispels Friday The 13th isnt a true remake; a dizzyingly fragmented montage dispenses with the original films storyline during the opening credits as Pamela Voorhees dies (after delivering a typically thudding chunk of exposition ""You let him drown Jason was my son"") and her hellborn offspring Jason heads out into the world. From there its another generic entry in the franchise as Jason slaughters his way through one group of interchangeable twentysomethings who wander into the woods seeking a crop of wild marijuana and then another group staying at the palatial family cabin of smug fussy asshole Travis Van Winkle. Theres a smidgen of plot as soulful local boy Jared Padalecki causes drama among Van Winkles group while seeking his sister Amanda Righetti who was part of the first group. But like the sex play and drug jokes its largely a backdrop to keep the machete-fodder occupied until Jason comes along. By this point anyone who shows up to a Friday The 13th movie should know exactly what to expect--naked boobs and ghastly murders consecutively or concurrently--and Nispels latest coughs up both with uninspired machinelike precision. Some self-aware humor finally creeps into the otherwise predictable proceedings particularly courtesy of Aaron Yoo whose lengthy funny sequence of drunkenly talking to himself in a tool-filled shed passes for a highlight. (So does the appearance of the shed itself; its panoply of instruments of potential mayhem briefly but wrongly imply that Jason is about to exchange his signature machete for some more creative tools.) But mostly the film operates like a vending machine Put 10 in and it spits out some prepackaged toplessness and gore. Jason apparently never gets weary but this series sure has.

Entering its 30th year (see cinema decline of) the idiot offspring of Halloween and Mario Bavas Twitch of the Death Nerve ""reboots""--which means the first few minutes restage the originals climax followed by a modern-day teaser that grinds up some expendable nobodies . . . and thats before the title dude After that the movie proper offers more of the same. This means that for one ticket price you get three shoddy Friday the 13th movies packed into one which might constitute entertainment value if any one of them constituted entertainment. Fanboys will resent director Marcus ""I Fucked Up The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake"" Nispels perfunctory ax/machete/bear trap money shots Deaths are plentiful but kinda blah--hardly comparable to Tom Savinis groundbreaking gore effects in the 1980 original. (Chekhov was right A woodchipper in the first act will fire up in the third.) Of special note (besides the movies boob quotient and weirdly insistent anti-pot subtext) is Arlen Escarpeta in the ever-popular role of the Black Guy Whos Toast. It falls to Escarpeta to confront the hockey-masked machete-wielding madman with the most ineffectual weapon in slasher-movie history--which prompted the woman behind me to mutter ""Aw man dont drop that wok.""

"Friday the 13th (2009) | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; friday-the-13th-2009 ) Friday the 13th (2009) (United States 2009) February 11 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Sometimes I wonder if theres a point to reviewing something like this. Then again if I shared my thoughts about Sex and the City why not Friday the 13th? Lets get this out of the way at the start If all youre looking for is breasts blood and gore this film hits pay dirt. None of the killings are terribly inventive but they are plentiful and why bother being devious when axes machetes knives and pointed sticks will do the job just as well? Call me a rebel but I ask a little more from my horror movies. Much as I enjoy the crimson tide of copious bloodlettings I like the film to work on another slightly higher level. The best horror films generate a level of almost unbearable tension. Theres none of that here. Tension requires at a minimum a degree of character identification and its laughable to argue that anyone in this production could be considered a ""character."" Theyre sheep lined up for the slaughter. The story doesnt make a whole lot of sense but that goes with the territory. Gone are the days when filmmakers actually spent time and effort on a horror movie screenplay. Gone are the days when anyone cared. Considering Friday the 13th to be a remake is erroneous although thats how its being marketed. Its more of an alternate timeline exploration. The movie informs us at the beginning that it accepts the events of the 1980 original as its backstory. From there it embarks upon a new course essentially having the events of this movie replace those of Parts II and III. There are echoes of those movies here but were not in strict remake territory. This Friday the 13th is to the series as H20 is to the Michael Myers saga. The older events and characters remain but the later sillier ones are swept away so things can start anew. Not that theyre being replaced by anything appreciably better. Friday the 13th opens with a bang - a high-energy prologue that sets up the pieces and knocks them down before announcing the films title. Had the rest of the movie followed suit Id be recommending it to more than tits-and-gore lovers. Alas the main story is a mess with all the clichA(c)s firmly in place the characters doing the dumb things one expects from them in horror movies and no suspense whatsoever about whos got a chance to make it to the last reel. The narrative flow is inordinately choppy but thats probably not the sort of thing most Friday the 13th viewers will notice (or care about). This time around our victims-in-waiting are a group of post-college men and women who have driven up to a summer home situated on the shores of Crystal Lake not that far from the infamous ""Camp Blood."" (In a nod to the original the location is still in Sussex County New Jersey. However unlike the original it wasnt actually filmed there.) The seven vacationers are Trent (Travis Van Winkle) a stuck-up prick who screams like a girl; his girlfriend Jenna (Danielle Panabaker); Bree (Julianna Guill) and Chelsea (Willa Ford) the hot girls who are guaranteed to get naked; Lawrence (Arlen Escarpeta) the token black; Chewie (Aaron Yoo) the token Asian; and the utterly forgettable Nolan (Ryan Hansen). Also in the mix are Whitney (Amanda Righetti) who is being held captive by mass killer Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) and her brother Clay (Jared Padalecki) who is searching the woods for her. Theres no need to go into further details about the plot since it replicates that of 80% of the slasher films out there. The blood sex profanity and nudity are more extreme here than in the 1980 movie but I suppose thats progress. The thing thats the most frustrating about this new Friday the 13th is how little creativity went into this re-imagination. The original may be a landmark on the cinematic landscape in terms of its importance to the genre but it was not a great motion picture. There was an opportunity here to take the basic idea and do something special with it. For about 15 minutes it appeared that was happening. After thata| we get something thats more soulless more pointless and less enjoyable than anything in the original. Remake reboot re-envisioning - whatever you call it it amounts to the same thing a cynical money grab. This movie exists for the same reason that Rob Zombies Halloween travesty was made - because the studios behind the projects wont give up until every last cent is bled out of the titles and they survive only as punch lines to bad jokes. This is the twelfth movie featuring Jason Voorhees Camp Crystal Lake and/or some combination of the two. Do we really want a thirteenth? If you can answer ""yes"" to that question especially with this one unseen then you deserve what director Marcus Nispel and co-producers Sean S. Cunningham and Michael Bay have provided.

Gilligans Island soap on a rope Bon Jovi - just a few things that exist mostly on reputation. You can include the original Friday the 13th in that lot. Now its back again not as another sequel but as a ""re-imagining"" linking the first film with the present. The original which came out in 1980 is remembered as some sort of slasher-film landmark when in fact it was notable only as a rip-off of the far-superior Halloween. (That and for giving Kevin Bacon one of his earliest roles.) An endless string of sequels has led us to this Friday the 13th a different take on the series that - damning-with-faint-praise alert - isnt as bad as youd think. Taking cues from elements of the first few films this version at least has a sense of humor about itself with plenty of knowing tips of the blood-stained cap not just to the earlier films but to the genre itself. When a character says at night that hes going to the tool shed down the path the mind reels at the possibilities. And wasnt it Anton Chekhov who said one must not put a wood chipper on stage if no one is thinking of using it? Or something like that. This time around a group of kids head back to the now-abandoned Camp Crystal Lake where they drink and have sex which can lead to only one outcome death and dismemberment at the hands of the evil killing machine Jason Voorhes (Derek Mears). Hes still getting revenge on his late mothers orders for his camp counselors letting him drown all those years ago. The groups misadventures make up the films extended intro lasting nearly a half-hour. After the credits we meet Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki whose presence makes the film seem like a less-good episode of Supernatural). Hes looking for his sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti) one of the missing members of the first group. He runs into another bunch of party-hungry kids led by the rich obnoxious Trent (Travis Van Winkle). Normally in these films we dont root for Jason but in this case . . . More wild drinking drugs and sex ensues but not for the stoic Clay who sticks to the task at hand. Hes joined in his search of the cabins around the lake by Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) Trents girlfriend who is growing tired of his attitude. A bloodbath ensues. What you were expecting dinner and drinks? Wrong movie. The original Friday the 13th lacked an intriguing story existing mostly as an exercise in killing people in inventive ways. This version also runs through the list of genre-accepted slayings most of which you can probably tick off with ease. But it also teases with a couple more a nice touch. Yes the acting is generic - Padaleckis the best of the lot though thats not saying much - but this iteration of Friday the 13th at least knows what its up to. While there is plenty of gore and gratuitous sex the movie acknowledges the ridiculousness of it all trusting that the audience - one hopes - is in on the joke.
