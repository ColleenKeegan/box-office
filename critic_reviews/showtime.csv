Mitch is teamed with patrol officer and buffoonish thespian Trey Sellars (Murphy) for a reality TV show produced by Chase Renzi (Russo) who needs a hit after faking a flammable baby pyjamas expose. The casting is an extended in-joke (the three leads have all served time in buddy movies) but the film far from being a knowing send-up of the genre plays out the old routines with a disheartening lack of new tricks. A Johnnie Cochran walk-on and a riff on the dual meanings of the word shoot are among the indications that director Dey aspires to satire. Then he stages another car chase or fawns over the villains arsenal of Really Big Guns and his true agenda is exposed. Even the out-takes that last refuge of the desperate director are abysmal. Alan Silvestris zany score which over-eggs every one-liner deserves special derision.

USATODAY.com - Showtime has flash but no pop Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/14/2002 - Updated 1019 PM ET Showtime has flash but no pop By Mike Clark USA TODAY Showtime (out of four) Stars Robert De Niro Eddie Murphy Rene Russo William Shatner Director Tom Dey Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for action violence language and some drug content Showtime isnt just another case of if youve seen the trailer youve seen the movie. This time youve seen the movie if youve seen the print ads. In fact just think of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy then plunk cops into the mix and youll know everything that three writers and director Tom Dey (in a sophomore slump after his sparkling Shanghai Noon debut) contribute to formula filmmaking here. But this time-killer has an advantage that many formula movies dont. Read more below Video Watch the Showtime trailer De Niros scowl and Murphys sass are inherently funny though in this case both actors are forced to call in moviegoers long-established goodwill. De Niro plays a stolid LAPD detective who just wants to do his job -- busting street scum. Patrol officer Murphy has a natural showbiz demeanor that gives him a huge professional advantage over his cantankerous new partner after the two are ordered (and not very credibly) to take part in a new reality-TV show about law enforcement. Anything goes which explains how two other Showtime components -- beyond the star-power pairing -- are drug-dealer brutality and poking fun at William Shatner who is cast as himself. Thanks to his T.J. Hooker background Shatner is employed by the series producer (a drably photographed Rene Russo) to direct the novice actors in teleprompter reading and snappy intros. He pronounces De Niros character the worst actor he has seen and before long he disappears until the predictable outtakes that roll during the end credits. If the drug subplot is what youve seen in a hundred other movies the villains weapons arent. These baddies level an entire building with advanced weaponry obtained from an ammo source that ends up as the setting of another major shoot-up. At least the tired narcotics angle sparks the movies funniest sequence. To get a jailed fall guy to rat out a ring leader Murphy poses as the producer of a cable-TV show that springs the wrongly incarcerated imploring a young fool whom hes running verbal rings around to spill his guts. Its the kind of scene Murphy still does better than anyone else. After taking the trouble to set up a climactic hotel disaster scene Dey seems to rush it at the end as if the rest of the cast were hurrying to meet Shatner in the hotel bar. This does however keep the movie at about 90 minutes which is as good for us as it is for theaters. (That way they get more plays a day the first week.) Then word will get out that the fleetingly amusing Showtime isnt much of a show at all.

Faison William Shatner. Directed by Tom Dey from a screenplay by Keith Sharon Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. 92 minutes. Rated PG-13 for action violence language and some drug content. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article Eddie Murphy is given a comedians dream role in the uneven but frequently engaging comedy ""Showtime"" -- hes playing an amateur actor somewhat less gifted than himself. As Trey Sellars an inept LAPD cop who dabbles in ""semi-independent films"" and dreams of being on television Murphys always grinning and posing and whipping off his sunglasses to deliver speeches in stentorian drama-school tones. Hes very funny in a larger-than-life sort of way and his performance keeps the movie percolating even when all else around him is withering away. Trey whos been waiting for his big break becomes the unlikely partner of Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) an old-style cop with little patience for showboating when the two are paired for the reality-TV series ""Showtime."" They squabble with each other cope with the demands of producer Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) and almost as an afterthought pursue a major crime lord (Pedro Damian who we know is evil because he sports platinum-blond hair with scary dark roots). Its a promising-enough target for satire and director Tom Dey showed a pleasant touch with buddy comedies in 2000s ""Shanghai Noon"" but ""Showtime"" has trouble sustaining its energy. Part of the problem is De Niro whos reduced to playing straight man (and we know he can be funny given the opportunity) in a script that gives him nothing to do. Midway through the filmmakers toss him a bit of shtick -- turns out the gruff Mitch is a would-be ceramic artist -- but it feels too self-consciously goofy. So De Niro just spends the movie looking exasperated as well he might. And while ""Showtime"" begins quite appetizingly setting itself up as a satire of both cop/buddy movies and reality TV the satire gets watered down as the movie progresses finally disappearing entirely. Russo who charges through the movie with the fast-talking sexy glibness she showed in ""Tin Cup"" is at first very funny as the producer. (""We need a reality change"" she barks to her assistant when first entering the police station where ""Showtime"" will be filmed. ""This is hideous."") But her role and that of William Shatner (the former ""T.J. Hooker"" amusingly plays himself as a revered director of cop shows) seem truncated as ""Showtime"" gradually becomes just another buddy comedy. Not a bad one thanks to Murphy -- but you have to wonder what might have been. Finally a note on the movies PG-13 rating This movie is every bit as bullet-heavy as last weeks R-rated ""All About the Benjamins"" with the difference being that a) ""Showtime"" features mainstream Hollywood stars and b) we dont see any blood as the result of all those bullets (although several people die). This is what the MPAA calls ""action violence "" as opposed to untidy violence with consequences I suppose. Parents you have been warned. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures action comedy Showtime also starring Rene Russo. (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Schlock Time / De Niro and Murphys buddy film a sham of a movie 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SHOWTIME Action comedy. Starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. Directed by Tom Dey. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Showtime"" is a disgrace to the talents of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy but its not enough just to say that. Its also a disgrace to the talents of Rene Russo and whoever drove the coffee truck to the set every day. If anyone ever needed a demonstration of what happens to actors when that ventriloquist known as the screenwriter is missing in action this is it. Ever hear the two seconds of music that plays out of a stereo after you cut the power? The beginning of ""Showtime"" is a little like that. Theres De Niro. Theres Murphy. Everything seems fine for a few moments. We dont know that these actors are operating without life support. And then we do know and nothing could be more obvious. Its work just trying to figure out what the filmmakers were attempting to do. De Niro plays a hard-boiled detective who has nothing but his job and a lousy apartment. Murphy is a patrolman who doesnt really want to be a cop. He wants to be an actor who plays cops in the movies. Theyre thrown together when a TV producer (Russo) pairs the two in a reality-based TV show. As a satire of television the movie doesnt have the honesty to follow through on its premise. Trey (Murphy) is incompetent as a cop and plays to the camera while Mitch (De Niro) is an expert detective who hates appearing on the show. In the world of ""Showtime"" that translates into baskets of fan mail for Trey and public indifference toward Mitch when in reality Mitch would be the audiences darling. The TV camera homes in too closely not to spot a phony. ""Showtime"" is even more of a joke as an action movie. Pedro Damian plays Vargas a heavily accented villain whose major threat to the peace of Los Angeles is that he has bought himself some guns. Really big ones. Not scared yet? At a time when people are worried about biological chemical or nuclear weapons it would take a lot more imagination than this film possesses to get an audience shuddering at a bad guy with big guns. Yet the movie harps on the guns as if the audience would be interested. In one scene Vargas shows up at the home of a lieutenant and criticizes him for using the gun thereby alerting the police to its existence. To punish him Vargas stands outside the mans house with some henchmen and fires machine-gun rounds into the house until it collapses. That Vargas is a stickler for discretion. De Niro goes through the film with that rankled uncomfortable look we usually see only in his rare televised interviews. Its not just that hes playing a held-back guy. Its a held-back performance and who could blame him? Murphy approaches Trey with more abandon but theres only so much he can do with a character whose personality and abilities change from scene to scene. Screenwriters Keith Sharon Alfred Gough and Miles Millar present him as a buffoon one minute and as a capable cop the next. And while De Niro and Murphy remain intrinsically appealing theres nothing in this buddy comedy to make us believe these fellows can ever become friends nor do we care whether they do. The movie has only one virtue William Shatner. Hes onscreen for less than five minutes but when he is ""Showtime"" achieves the lightness and ease of satire for which it strives. Shatner plays himself a consultant brought in to teach the fellows how to act like cops for the television medium. He teaches them how to say lines like ""Who stole the money?"" and raise one eyebrow. By raising self-satire to the level of art Shatner is becoming a national treasure.

Theres Andie MacDowell a performer of light brittle talent if excellent hair and teeth plus earnest Everyman David Strathairn best known for keeping his chin up in various John Sayles morality tales plus . . . Croatia 1991. Perhaps something got lost in the translation. The films co-writer and director Elie Chouraqui a Frenchman whose previous movies have been dramas and romantic comedies most of which never made it out of France drew inspiration for this feature from a book by photojournalist Isabel Ellsen called Le Diable a lAvantage an autobiographical account of the authors affair with another photographer during the Croatian civil war. From this material published in 1995 Chouraqui along with co-writers Ellsen and Didier Le Pecheur have fashioned a premise so patently absurd so implausible they might as well have pitched it to the Oxygen channel Suburban American wife goes looking for her missing husband in the middle of the Croatian war. But heres the punch line -- when it isnt straining credulity or patience the film is rattling you down to your bones. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - MacDowell is Sarah Lloyd a photo editor at Newsweek whose husband Harrison (Strathairn) wins the magazine Pulitzers for shooting atrocity photographs. Recently returned from Africa and its reliably photogenic misery Harrison has decided to hang up his Canon. But like the movie sheriff who yearns to turn his six-guns into plowshares Harrison has one last mission in him as well as a contract to fulfill -- which is why he winds up in Croatia where he promptly disappears. Until this point Harrisons Flowers has been watchable but undistinguished. MacDowell Strathairn and the production design are easy on the eyes and theres grit in a supporting performance by Alun Armstrong as Sam the editor who sends Harrison to the Balkans. However a scene at an awards ceremony honoring Harrisons colleague Yeager Pollack (Elias Koteas) as well as a subsequent bathroom showdown between Harrison and a younger photographer Kyle (Adrien Brody) are the sort of phony overblown set pieces in which characters dont as much talk as spell out themes in 72-point type. In the mens room Kyle nose powdered with cocaine sneers about journalistic ethics and guts to Harrison while the beret-wearing Yeager waves a crutch around and the film itself veers perilously toward the abyss of pure movie schlock.Then something happens. In the newsroom Sarah learns of Harrisons disappearance and crumples to the ground waving off colleagues with a trembling hand. After burrowing into grief she persuades herself that her husband is still alive kisses the kids goodbye flies to Austria and rents a car. (Its strange to think of someone driving into war but thats exactly what she does. The rental agent worriedly asks if shes going to Yugoslavia as the last car ""came back with holes."") Accompanied by a Croatian hitchhiker Sarah crosses the border between Austria and a disintegrating Yugoslavia and on an otherwise empty road drives past one abandoned farm after another. Its eerily quiet. Back in New York Sarah had been watching the war on television and its prepared us for the sound of gunfire perhaps for distant explosions but here even nature has gone mute. There are no barnyard birds no cows nothing. Suddenly as if out of thin air a woman runs past at breakneck speed. Sarah glances back quizzically a frown tugging at her mouth then pulls into the wreckage of a small village. At this point the tension in the film is electric almost unbearable like that moment when youre watching a too-scary movie -- not the moment when the monster attacks but the one just before when the story seems to drop out leaving a quiet only violence can fill. In Harrisons Flowers the quiet fills in with a roar and in one stunning heart-clutching scene Sarah almost loses her life even as Chouraqui goes a long way toward saving his film.A long way but not far enough. What happens next is visceral unrelenting affecting and as often exasperating. Sarah joins up with a group of photojournalists one of whom happens to be Kyle who along with another photographer (Brendan Gleeson) travels with Sarah to Vukovar where Harrison may be hospitalized. Its all pretty nutty -- enough unfortunately to take you out of the story every so often mostly to imagine the compromises that found a film this graphic and bloody set against a war in which thousands lost their lives headed up by the star of Four Weddings and a Funeral. Whats even nuttier though is how much of it does work. If you dont think too much about MacDowells beauty apparent even under smears of red its because she doesnt have to do much except look wild-eyed like everyone else. In Chouraquis Vukovar what matters are the dead and the nearly dead along with Nicola Pecorinis urgent camera work. In a recent New York Times article correspondent Stephen Kinzer criticized Harrisons Flowers for including among other improbabilities photographers who shoot wars standing rather than lying down. What he didnt observe was that by watching a war through its photojournalists instead of its soldiers we see something thats become increasingly rare at the movies -- a war not just of heroes and villains but of ordinary people both the journalists and those they photograph. Here after all is a movie that at its best makes you forget who its star is. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm In Showtime yet another bootleg copy of the Lethal Weapon franchise Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy play another of the LAPDs endearingly cuddly odd couples. Following various plot complications but mainly because the pairing of these two leads seemed somehow inevitable undercover detective Mitch Preston (De Niro) teams up with Trey Sellars (Murphy) street cop and aspiring actor and together the two become stars of a reality-television program called Showtime. Gruff professional probably psychotic and absent any visible tan Mitch looks and sounds as if hed be a lot more at home munching Krispy Kremes on Manhattans West Side than taking sass from Trey whose idea of good policing and good acting comes from a close study of T.J. Hooker. The producer of the TV program Chase Renzi is played by Rene Russo whose facility at making throwaway banter while making eyes at the white lead was well established in both the third and fourth chapters of the Lethal Weapon opus the last of which was written by two of this films writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. Showtime is better than the fourth Lethal Weapon which was pretty bad but not as good as the original Lethal Weapon or the superior 48HRS. the first movie in which Murphy put a jive brother into play against an uptight if fundamentally righteous older white guy.Unlike Nick Nolte though De Niro isnt actually playing a part but riffing on his own legend much as he did to much worse effect in last years despicable 15 Minutes. In that cop movie a two-hander with Edward Burns De Niro starred as still another famous detective up against still another bad guy from a foreign country. Then it was a crazy Czech; now its some crazy Spanish guy of indeterminate national origin named Vargas played with brio by Pedro Damian (recently seen in Collateral Damage a thriller about crazy Colombians). In 15 Minutes De Niro invoked Travis Bickle the psychopathic hero of Taxi Driver and here he does the same this time with a brief recapitulation of Travis iconic ""You talkin to me?"" speech. Its cheap but its also pretty funny -- though not as deft and feather-light as it should be partly because director Tom Dey who previously made old-fashioned raillery out of the ethnic odd-coupling of Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan in Shanghai Noon needs to pick up his pace or at least a better script. (Too often De Niros burn is more poky than slow.) The other problem is that unlike in last years comic mismatch with Ben Stiller in Meet the Parents De Niro doesnt show enough visible contempt for his partner while Murphy who plays to the older actor instead of against him shows nothing but affection. What Murphy and De Niro show for William Shatner whos either very game or out of his mind is something entirely different. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Its laughing at us. Review No time for Showtime By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Youd think people cant define ""satire"" anymore based on the evidence of ""Showtime"" an empty cop movie spoof that could have been a momentous first-time teaming of Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro. The aimless screenplay by Keith Sharon Alfred Gough and Miles Millar relies on easy sarcasm thats more suitable to an overpaid second-stringer like Martin Lawrence than two of the better actors currently working in movies. But thats only part of the problem. Director Tom Dey pretends to make fun of a film-industry formula while hedging his bets by staging booming cliches without a trace of irony. Its hard to tell exactly what the joke is supposed to be. Things start out well anyway. In the opening scene we see Los Angeles police investigator Mitch Preston (De Niro) mundanely telling a classroom of elementary schoolchildren that his job on the street is nothing like what they see in the movies. He doesnt jump from rooftop to rooftop while pursuing bad guys he says and he seldom fires his weapon. Mostly he just does investigative footwork and fills out reports.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Showtime Bruce McBroom) D Showtime Genre Comedy Action/Adventure; Starring Robert De Niro Eddie Murphy Mos Def Rene Russo; Guest Performer William Shatner; Director Tom Dey; Author Keith Sharon; Release Date Wide 03/15/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted March 13 2002 -- 1200 AM EST Robert De Niro tends to look disgruntled at the best of times never more so than when hes cast as the straight man in one of his lighter-side-of-Bobby-D. ""comedy thrillers."" In Showtime the disgruntlement takes on an unintended dimension. De Niro plays Mitch Preston a hotheaded LAPD detective who is forced to star in a weekly reality-TV series a kind of buddy version of ""Cops."" On the show hes paired with a hambone fellow officer Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) who wants nothing more out of life than to act like hes Starsky or T.J. Hooker. When Murphy rolls off the hood of his car action-cop-show style or barks out a ""Freeze police"" cliche with both eyes on the camera De Niro offers up one of his patented dyspeptic grimaces. Except that Murphys moves arent wild or exaggerated enough to actually be you know funny (he just looks like a TV-cop cipher) and so De Niro seems to be reacting to nothing so much as the lame movie hes stuck in. Unlike ""Analyze This"" or ""Meet the Parents"" ""Showtime"" is a lead-balloon caper a showcase for the duller side of Bobby D. Murphy by contrast might almost be doing a replicant version of his live-wire younger self. His verbal energy even at its most superficially aggressive now comes across as an overeagerness to please. The premise of ""Showtime"" makes it sound like a media satire but its one of the films more inept oddities that the De Niro-Murphy reality show as it looks on television remains almost entirely out of our view adding to the feeling that the jokes in this movie if there ever were any must now be on the cutting-room floor.
