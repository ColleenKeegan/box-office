Film  Drama 2 out of 5 stars Add review 0 Love It Save it 0 Add review 0 Love It Save it Time Out says 2 out of 5 stars Details Users say Time Out says 2 out of 5 stars One of the most successful and prolific independent artists in modern American film playwright-turned-director Tyler Perry has spent the past decade persuading audiences that African-Americans can be just as smug shallow and bourgeois as their white brethren. Why Did I Get Married Too? follows four troubled couples on a Bahamian getaway where the men drink beer and talk about sex while their wives get massages and talk about love. Perrys directorial style is soapy and bland his writing shallow and predictable. But theres still fun to be had a scene where Janet Jackson trashes her apartment with a golf club heightens the melodramatic intensity while a last-minute celebrity cameo raises a smile.  And as recriminations give way to tearful bouts of learning hugging and growing it becomes clear why Oprah is such a huge Perry fan.

"Why Did I Get Married Too is full of laughs -- and promise - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMOVIE REVIEW Why Did I Get Married Too is full of laughs -- and promiseBy adopting a looser directorial style its evident Tyler Perry is growing as a cinematic artist. But for better or worse he didnt abandon his all-too-familiar operatic scenes and easy solutions.April 05 2010|By Michael Ordona With ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too?"" the Atlanta writing-directing-producing-acting juggernaut takes significant steps forward as a filmmaker. But its still a Tyler Perry movie -- for better or worse.The new film is a sequel to 2007s ""Why Did I Get Married?"" with its four-plus married couples still lovin and fightin up a storm -- this time starting at an island retreat for the friends. If you missed the first movie dont fret theres plenty of exposition to catch you up.Patricia and Gavin (Janet Jackson and Malik Yoba) are the aggressively ideal pair; Terry and Dianne (Perry and Sharon Leal) are the more relaxed version; Sheila and Troy (Jill Scott and Lamman Rucker) are the newest couple having gotten together in the last movie as Sheilas marriage to abusive swine Mike (Richard T. Jones) collapsed. Comic relief is provided by the always-battling Angela and Marcus (Tasha Smith and Michael Jai White). When Mike shows up uninvited consider the pot stirred.But the specifics of the plot arent crucially important The upshot is that everyone who seems perfect isnt and everyone who seems evil isnt totally.The news here is that Perry has adopted a looser directorial style that allows more room for the actors to relate. Some exchanges feel improvised and the often hand-held cinematography helps further distance the proceedings from the staginess of some of his previous efforts. This means the acting is more flowing in general while allowing Smith to gnaw her way through scenes like a wolverine and White (so good in the under-seen ""Black Dynamite"") to earn laughs as her training dummy. Scott and Rucker in particular are likable presences Rucker benefiting from a more fleshed-out version (with timely issues) of the knight in shining armor he played in the first film.The downside to some of these improvised-seeming exchanges is a fair amount of repetitive and too on-the-nose dialogue -- although ""Relationships are supposed to be about . . . trust"" is probably the writers fault not the actress. And the film still reaches for those operatic emotions and easy solutions that mark Perrys oeuvre -- the movies ending seems so pat that it provokes laughter. Even when the movie dips its toe in perhaps the most nuanced conflict yet in any of the filmmakers works -- an emotional affair -- it then reaches for a facile wrap- up.The film delivers the laughs and domestic crises that should keep it on pace with its predecessors at the box office. Fans know exactly what to expect and Smith in particular is a crowd pleaser. Her work and Whites help freshen some of the elements that bear an unquestionable sameness to previous Perry films. But not only is Perry in tune with his audience as always hes unquestionably growing as a cinematic artist.calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOWN still bets on Tyler Perrys Single Moms Club after...March 17 2014Tyler Perry no foe for Paranormal Activity 4 at box officeOctober 18 2012Tyler Perry movie king not mogulFebruary 27 2009Getting around while groundedSeptember 14 2008Tyler Perry is Married to way too much dramaOctober 15 2007Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-married5-2010apr05,0,2880335.story",200,tylerperry'swhydidigetmarriedtoo?2,tylerperry'swhydidigetmarriedtoo?,latimes

At Couples Reunion Laughs Then Grief Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too? Directed by Tyler Perry Comedy Drama Romance PG-13 2h 1m By MIKE HALEAPRIL 2 2010 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Tyler Perry likes to give full value for the entertainment dollar and ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too?"" is two movies for the price of one.The first half is a comedy about four married couples gathering for their annual Caribbean vacation. The second half is a seriously overwrought melodrama in which the fault lines that generated laughs in the first half open up doing damage -- in one case irreversible -- to all of the marriages before a tacked-on happy ending featuring an amusing uncredited cameo.Which is to say its a Tyler Perry movie with a little something for everyone as long as youre not expecting too much. Its a sequel to Mr. Perrys 2007 film ""Why Did I Get Married?"" (hence the awkward pun in the title) which was based on his play. All eight principal actors return to their roles including Lamman Rucker as Troy the new husband of Sheila (Jill Scott) who has divorced Mike (Richard T. Jones).If I had to choose between the two halves of ""Too"" Id go with the melodrama despite over-the-top touches like a scene in which the self-help author Pat (Janet Jackson) driven to her wits end by the relentless mechanics of the plot forces the other three couples to stand up and hug one another in a hospital waiting room. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At least the movies second half gives the cast particularly Ms. Jackson Ms. Scott Sharon Leal and Malik Yoba something to do besides look pretty. Ms. Jacksons destruction of a roomful of glass furniture with a golf club is invigorating and oddly funny and Mr. Perry manages a nice bit of indirection regarding whether one spouse is faithful.But getting there requires sitting through the comedy a term that in this case is purely categorical. Hardly any of the laugh lines about age marriage and the granting or withholding of sex connect; a beach scene with the four husbands thats supposed to be full of crackling repartee is so meandering and unfunny (it feels unwillingly improvised rather than written) that you cant wait for it to end. Photo Sharon Leal and Tyler Perry in ""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" Credit Quantrell Colbert/Lionsgate A large part of the problem is in the conception the characters are walking cliches of buppie success and stability achieved at the cost of the soul. (An early close-up of a Range Rover bumper with a Fulton County Ga. license plate tells us everything we need to know about one couple and unfortunately its meant to.) The ratio of soft to loud among the characters is 8 to 1 leaving Tasha Smith as the stereotypically sassy Angela to carry the entire comic load.Mr. Perry himself plays Terry the most reserved and mature of the group. At the risk of being condescending it has to be said that if he had put on his dress and wig and shown up as Madea the movie might have been funnier.Also worth mentioning is the queasy dynamic in which the male characters violent impulses are condemned in theory but when acted on seem to be implicitly excused or at least overlooked. Over all its the men who always wind up the victims -- misunderstood shut out sick dead. Theyre the ones who bear the cross of marriage. (We wont get into the running motif in which Mr. Joness character now the outcast of the group is disparaged for being ""sensitive"" and drinking ""fruit juice."")Halfway through the movie Lou Gossett Jr. and Cicely Tyson come walking down the beach to dispense some wisdom about marriage like the sages of a Shakespeare comedy. The chance to gaze at Ms. Tysons amazing face in its halo of bright white hair is the best thing about ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too?"" While youre at it you can ponder the fact that four decades ago she got to play substantial star-making roles in ""Sounder"" ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" and ""Roots."" The younger members of the cast should be so lucky. ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too?"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A lot of talk about sex and drugs and some unsettling moments of domestic violence.Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too?Opened on Friday nationwide.

Why indeed Janet Jackson with Tyler Perry on the movie set. (Lionsgate/quantrell Colbert) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jen Chaney Saturday April 3 2010 Lets say that alien beings came to Earth on a mission to learn about marriage among humans. Lets also say those aliens chose to base their education on ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too?"" This StoryMovie review The second time around Married is too familiarView trailer Heres what the ETs would assume about whats involved in the daily struggle to remain husband and wife Lots of yelling. Routinely suspecting and/or accusing your spouse of having affairs. And joining fellow married friends on annual opulent vacations involving copious alcohol consumption and endless gossip about everyones relationship woes followed by additional yelling. In other words ""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" covers pretty much the same histrionic territory as Perrys 2007 picture ""Why Did I Get Married?"" picking up our core group of attractive dysfunctional African American couples three years after we last left them in snowy Colorado. This time they gather for relaxation and renewal in the Bahamas at a beach house so massive and Pottery Barn-catalogue-stunning it makes Angela Bassetts pad in ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" look like a thatched hut. As in the prequel most of the comedy comes from the most volatile of the four pairs the lunkheaded Marcus (Michael Jai White) and the wife you can hear coming from 99 miles away Angela (Tasha Smith). For the first hour or so ""Married Too"" -- which in Perry tradition did not screen in advance for critics -- plays like an empty but diverting beach read. Your brain recognizes that the dialogue for example doesnt come from any place that remotely resembles relationship reality. (At one point Marcus actually says ""Why did I get married?"" to which Angela responds ""Why did I get married too?"" Why to create a movie sequel title of course) But the film is so pretty to look at and its soap opera-style plotlines -- especially the one involving the always empathetic Jill Scott as Sheila a recently remarried new mom attempting to emotionally support an unemployed husband -- are just engaging enough to hold our interest. Then everyone leaves the Bahamas and the film shifts in tone Janet Jackson who made this movie while grieving the death of brother Michael takes center stage as the mad black woman whose repressed anguish over the long-ago death of her only child threatens to blow up her perfectly picture-framed marriage. Translation If you happen to live with Janet Jackson in a house filled with a ludicrous amount of glass furniture and you really really tick her off do not let that woman anywhere near a set of golf clubs. Perry throws in melodramatic plot twist after melodramatic plot twist in the last 10 minutes all of which serves as a heart-tugging preamble to a surprise movie-closing cameo appearance that drew gasps and giggles from the audience at an early morning screening in Georgetown. Its an ending not just from left field but from outer space.  PG-13. Contains thematic material including sexuality language drug references and some domestic violence.

Print Email Martin Tsai/The Star-Ledger By Martin Tsai/The Star-Ledger The Star-Ledger Follow on Twitter on April 02 2010 at 527 PM updated April 30 2010 at 736 PM comments Quantrell ColbertJanet Jackson and Malik Yoba are among the stars of ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too?"" Tyler Perry -- actor director screenwriter producer and virtual one-man studio -- makes movies that seem like dramatized self-help books providing armchair couples counseling for the masses. His films mean well and offer some insight and empowerment -- if you can get past the benighted archetypes and dubious scenarios. Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too? (PG-13) Lionsgate (121 min.) Directed by Tyler Perry. With Tyler Perry Janet Jackson Jill Scott Malik Yoba Michael Jai White Louis Gossett Jr. and Cicely Tyson. Now playing at theaters throughout New Jersey. Star-Ledger review ONE AND A HALF STARS Ratings note Sexuality language drug references and some domestic violence But Perry has a gift for capturing a woman scorned and a relationship breaking down that obviously resonates with many folks. His stage and screen efforts have proved immensely lucrative. A sequel to a 2007 film -- which was based on a 2004 play -- ""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" is Perrys eighth movie. It revisits the four couples from the earlier movie as they gather for an annual retreat to repair their marriages. Patricia (Janet Jackson) a psychologist and self-help guru has little wisdom left for her own relationship with Gavin (Malik Yoba). Shelia (Jill Scott) has wed her prince charming Troy (Lamman Rucker) who has been struggling with unemployment since their move to Atlanta. Dianne (Sharon Leal) seems to be straying after rearing a son with Terry (Perry). Angela (Tasha Smith) once again succumbs to insecurity jealousy and alcoholism when Marcus (Michael Jai White) attains celebrity as a sports commentator. The new film is an improvement over the original in a few respects. Its funnier and sexier. But the sequel has its own set of shortcomings. The biggest challenge for Perry here is elaborating on a story line that was wrapped up with a neat little bow at the end of the previous film. ""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" has no dramatic arc; at times the script seems the result of free-association automatic writing. Behaviors are often incongruous with the characters and plots are in free fall. Troys could be a compelling story line; hes a man who attempts to take responsibility and do right but wont swallow his pride to ask for help now that his inability to land a job has strained his marriage. These are issues many ordinary couples must work through in this economy. But Perry squanders the opportunity to tackle this problem in an earnest way. He barely acknowledges the current recession preferring to retreat to tales of infidelities and filming the resulting recriminations and shouting matches. Perry sticks with the pedestrian shots and a Lifetime network aesthetic. He doesnt even take advantage of the films exotic Bahamian setting. As with the original the tremendously appealing cast does its best to salvage the film. Scott brings so much heart and soul to her character she makes you overlook Perrys poor writing. And Smith turns her over-the-top monster of a character into someone sympathetic and believable. Angela does need an intervention -- but not as much as Perry. Someone really needs to stop him or ""Why Did I Get Married? 3-D"" might be next. Martin Tsai may be reached at mtsaistarledger.com.

Janet Jackson as Patricia and Malik Yoba as Gavin (Quantrell Colbert) D Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too Starring Tyler Perry; Starring Janet Jackson Michael Jai White; Director Tyler Perry; Author Tyler Perry; Release Date Wide 04/02/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 113; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Lions Gate Films Posted April 2 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT So much for the benefits of amateur counseling Three years after Why Did I Get Married? in which four African-American couples (and long-time friends) asked that very question at a Colorado resort Tyler Perry reunites his marital specimens at a Bahamas resort for Why Did I Get Married Too? Apparently these students of pop psychology still dont know the answer. Instead theyve got more problems. Big loud problems. Big loud problems that involve yelling throwing things or turning a head away in passive-aggressive anger. Loudest of all is Tasha Smith as Angela the hectoring booze-guzzling cartoon big-mouth convinced that any woman her sportscaster husband (Michael Jai Smith) even lays his eyes on is a ""ho"" (her word) with whom hes cheating on her. Most likely to pretend everything is okay is Janet Jackson as Patricia the author of self-help books who is equally nuts and prone to smashing up her house of Expensive Glass Items with the aid of her husbands golf clubs. If these ladies and their gents ever had valuable lessons to impart about about marriage commitment family and keeping the romantic spark alive in the first movie theyve lost their authority in this trite exhausted sequel. Its a contradiction in terms to think of the phenomenally successful prolific entertainment showman Tyler Perry as lazy but theres no other description for this particular product Terribly shot and crudely assembled WDIGMT? serves up speeches about trust and fidelity and rolling with the punches and blah blah blah. But it does so with so little energy that the actors might as well be saying the words blah blah blah.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres not much point in treating Tyler Perry movies as freestanding entities a perspective to which no one subscribes more than Perry himself. The follow-up to 2007s Why Did I Get Married? plays less like a sequel than a prolonged epilogue. If lines like ""You remember Keisha and the penicillin shot"" dont mean anything to you youre not likely to find your footing quickly if at all. Luckily Perrys sense of drama is so generic that newcomers can fill in the backstory themselves. Chances are whatever they come up with will be more interesting. Too? begins at a resort in the Bahamas whose pastel backgrounds add a hint of color to an otherwise dreary procession of identical medium shots as each of the movies eight protagonists lays out their sundry dilemmas. (Visually its somewhere between the relatively high production values of the Madea movies and the threadbare look of The Family That Preys.) Sportscaster Michael Jai White and wife Tasha Smith are constantly at each others throats over his busy schedule and her lack of trust; advice-book scribe Janet Jackson is suffering in silence as her marriage to Malik Yoba disintegrates able to confront everyones problems but her own; and Perry begins to suspect attorney wife Sharon Leal is engaging in a little ex parte infidelity at work. Things really get cooking when Jill Scotts abusive ex-boyfriend Richard T. Jones drops in uninvited determined to undermine her happy but fragile marriage to Lamman Rucker whose difficulty finding a job has put a dent in his manhood. Given that Perrys audience is largely female he cant afford to be too traditional in his outlook but hes always got something nasty in store for professional women who grow too enamored of their own success a plague that strikes Leals and Jacksons character as the pots start to boil. That might seem like a lot of plot but its only getting warmed up. Perrys films are shapeless but theyre crammed to bursting with melodramatic twists the kind that make the audience gasp as they chuckle. The movies like an old sofa overstuffed and misshapen but so familiar that it gives comfort all the same.

(Quantrell Colbert ) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday April 2 2010 236 PM Title Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too Its nice to have things we can rely on in this unpredictable life and among the most reliable of all are Tyler Perry movies. Perry makes what might be called Sermontainment wrapping faith-based lessons into seriocomic soap operas.There are two types of Perry films some with his drag alter ego Madea and some without. The former combine the broadest of comedy with the sudsiest of melodrama. The latter are relatively restrained offering a somewhat more realistic look at issues affecting his mostly urban audience.""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" revisits the couples we met in 2007s ""Why Did I Get Married?"" Perry - who also wrote and produced - once again plays Terry a devoted husband with a suddenly secretive wife (Sharon Leal). When the movie opens theyre on their way to the Bahamas for their annual retreat with several friends.Once everyone arrives the drama begins. Patricia (Janet Jackson) is a relationship expert who cant communicate with her own spouse (Malik Yoba). The volcanic Angela (Tasha Smith) is convinced her flirtatious husband (Michael Jai White) is cheating. And newlyweds Sheila (Jill Scott) and Troy (Lamman Rucker) are shocked to learn Sheilas violent ex (Richard T. Jones) will be joining them for the vacation.You wont find anything new here the sequel is basically a retread of the original in which Scott delivers the strongest emotional moments while an amusingly over-the-top Smith perpetually breaks the tension.In other words Perry doesnt take any artistic risks; hes got a formula and sticks to it. The point as always is to remind viewers that they arent the only ones dealing with a straying spouse a desperate job search a grievous personal loss. He offers solace in familiarity relief in low comedy and comfort in platitudes about love and trust.And who are we to question his logic? The man has built an empire by giving his audience the emotional uplift it wants critics be damned. (He doesnt screen his movies in advance for review and has little use for Hollywood machinery.)So when a new and notable love interest turns up unexpectedly at the end of the movie you can bet Perry is already preparing for the inevitable ""Why Did I Get Married Again?"" You can also confidently predict the plotlines. And you can be sure that if that sequel does happen it will be welcomed with open arms.

Peter Debruge Chief Film Critic AskDebruge 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr April 2 2010 | 0207PM PT ""Married"" offers a positive if melodramatically heightened portrait of upper-middle-class African-American life. Extending the self-help-by-example strategy of the original ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too?"" reassembles the four couples featured in the multi-talents 2008 couples-retreat dramedy and furnishes them with a fresh set of problems to work through. If some couples go to the movies to escape the arguments and stress of everyday life Perrys aud attends hoping to catch a glimpse of themselves amid all that catfighting and catharsis. ""Married"" offers a positive if melodramatically heightened portrait of upper-middle-class African-American life one broadly appealing enough to satisfy even the Nancy Meyers set if only theyd give it a chance. Since the original centered around liberating Sheila (Jill Scott) from her abusive marriage it figures that this follow-up would include not only her sensitive new beau Troy (Lamman Rucker) but also a surprise appearance from her trouble-making ex-husband (Richard T. Jones) just in time to spark the fireworks show that follows. But no marriage is perfect and a week of couples therapy in the Caribbean reveals the cracks in everyones relationships soon enough. Terry (Perry) and Dianne (Sharon Leal) are still the mellowest of the bunch but theres something more than work on her mind these days. And rather than dispense advice psychologist Patricia (Janet Jackson) might do well to examine her own rocky relationship with Gavin (Malik Yoba) more closely. The scene-stealers remain harpy Angela (Tasha Smith) and henpecked Marcus (Michael Jai White) whose constant squabbling has reached a histrionic high. If theres a unifying philosophy here its the idea that circumstances may change but people dont. Angelas not about to stop verbally abusing Marcus just because he landed a job on a high-profile sports talkshow and considering his past philandering her demands for his cell-phone password dont seem entirely unreasonable. Their colorful arguments drive the first half of the movie on the island where cameos from Louis Gossett Jr. and Cicely Tyson give Perry a chance to articulate eloquently another generations views on love. But a weeks vacation in the Bahamas doesnt have the same restorative effect the characters earlier Colorado trip did and they all return to Atlanta with more baggage than they brought. The shadow of divorce looms over all four couples with Gavin and Patricia actually attempting to go through with it -- giving an off-the-handle Jackson a chance to unleash all that emotion stored up over two movies. Pic plays like an extended sitcom abruptly truncated when the unusually harsh resolution to one conflict forces all the other couples to kiss and make up. Perry introduces a surprise character in the last minute of the film which suggests more episodes to follow. Like last years ""Obsessed"" ""Married"" matter-of-factly presents well-to-do black couples coping with everyday challenges offering an alternative to pics like ""Precious"" while still oversimplifying the African-American experience. The characters jobs -- which include doctor lawyer TV personality and author -- are the sort to which grade-school kids aspire rather than the professions of many real-world grown-ups and yet theres a positive message in that choice. ""Married"" is the sort of film intended to lead by example presenting situations and anecdotes auds can refer back to later. Perry is a confident enough storyteller that these modern-day parables weave seamlessly into a cohesive narrative though small clues (including a shoutout to Joe Kellys self-empowering picture book ""Douglas Fredericks and the House of They"") suggest his underlying moral voice recapped over the end credits by Jacksons song ""Nowhere.""
