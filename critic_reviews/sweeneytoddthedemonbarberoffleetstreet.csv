By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 21 2007 Save for later Saved Stephen Sondheim has not been well served in the movies. As he is the first to admit the filmed versions of ""A Little Night Music"" and ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" based on shows for which he wrote both music and lyrics were not wonderful and ""Gypsy"" where he functioned only as lyricist was glitzy and overly sunny. As for ""West Side Story"" I cant recall a best picture Oscar winner that has aged worse.To say therefore that ""Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is the best Sondheim adaptation ever filmed is not to say very much. But I dont mean to damn with faint praise. The film starring Johnny Depp is a considerable achievement even if on balance its more of a Tim Burton phantasmagoria than a Sondheim fantasia.And therein lies the rub. Ones fondness for this film will depend a lot on ones tolerance for Burton at his most ghoulishly gruesome. With Sondheims approval he and his screenwriter John Logan have pared down the almost three-hour stage show into a two-hour movie and retained in their original form only 10 of the shows 25 major numbers. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Purists will complain but the fact is the show moves a lot faster with all those ballads and backstories cleared away. I have wonderful memories of seeing Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou in the original 1979 Broadway production but why should Burton and Co. have set out to duplicate it? They have fashioned a movie musical that is first and foremost a movie and thats not something you see often. It works through the eyes - and as it turns out this approach also does wonders for the ears. Burton puts all of our senses on red alert. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 ""Sweeney Todd"" has a gothic look but a modern sensibility. Even trussed up in Victorian trappings the free-floating dread has an immediacy. Depps Sweeney has arrived back in London after escaping from 15 years of false imprisonment in Australia engineered by the Judge (a wonderful Alan Rickman) who stole his wife. Bent on revenge Sweeney partners with Mrs. Nellie Lovett (a pasty-faced Helena Bonham Carter) - he as a barber she as the piemaker whose delicacies are filled with the flesh of the victims he slaughters.The blood spurts freely - the only garish coloration in what otherwise resembles a black-and-white movie. Depp his hair jet black except for a skunkish streak of white looks ravaged and his singing which at times sounds like early David Bowie is throbbingly heartfelt.Burtons sensibility - lushly dank and penny dreadful - does not have the operatic expansiveness of Sondheims and so the movie is in some ways a diminishment of one of the great works of American theater. But it has a suggestiveness and terror all its own and thats achievement enough.

Director Tim BurtonGenre Musical ThrillerRunning Time 117 minutes Watch a Clip Notes Dev note migrated from resource_media Bob Mondellos Full Review In Sweeney Todd Blood Will Most Certainly Flow Dec. 20 2007 Londons skies are raining blood during the opening credits which amounts to a directorial declaration that meat pies and the fact of Johnny Depps singing arent going to be the only things for audiences to buzz about. In Tim Burtons splendid adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-Hugh Wheeler musical -- about a barber who slashes the throats of his clientele and a pie-baking landlady who doesnt want the corpses to go to waste -- blood flows both freely and imaginatively. Happily so do melody and feeling. Depps snarling vengeance-crazed Sweeney Todd is a wonder and Helena Bonham Carters Mrs. Lovett wields her rolling pin deftly. Both look as if they comb their hair with garden rakes and roll in flour before they head out in the morning to greet a London that Burton films in sooty grays with the occasional blood-red highlight. You expect the stars to nail the roles emotionally but they turn out to be decent vocalists as well with pop voices that work nicely in circumstances where projecting to the back row isnt an issue. Also handling vocal chores better than might be expected are Alan Rickman as Sweeneys nemesis Judge Turpin and Sacha Baron Cohen as a rival barber who fatally underestimates the competition. Newcomers Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower (whose Anthony looks from some angles uncannily like Claire Danes) are effective as the young lovers. Timothy Spall comes across as creepiness itself as the man who tries to keep them apart and one of Burtons more startling choices -- casting a 10-year-old boy as Toby a pivotal part usually played by an adult male -- pays eerie dividends in the final reel. In short the movie may substitute Grand Guignol for laughs at times but its spectacularly stylized -- each throat-slashing exceptional -- persuasively sung and imaginatively adapted for the screen.

Related Burton and Depp create a demon ""Sweeney Todd"" Movie review ""Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" with Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter Alan Rickman Timothy Spall Sacha Baron Cohen Laura Michelle Kelly Jayne Wisener Jamie Campbell Bower Edward Sanders. Directed by Tim Burton from a screenplay by John Logan with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. Based on the musical by Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler from an adaptation of the play ""Sweeney Todd"" by Christopher Bond. 114 minutes. Rated R for graphic bloody violence. Several theaters. If Tim Burton hadnt existed Stephen Sondheim would have had to invent him. The ""Edward Scissorhands"" filmmakers dark vision fits so perfectly with the anguished bloody yet hauntingly beautiful world created by Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler for their Tony-winning stage musical its as if Burton was born to direct it. Those who know ""Sweeney Todd"" can stop holding their breath; this film version (intelligently adapted for the screen by John Logan) is first-rate. Those who dont know it may find their breath taken away because this is a musical unlike those youve ever seen before. (Everyone knows now that ""Sweeney Todd"" is a musical right? Nobodys going to freak out when they go to the cinema and Johnny Depp starts singing right? Those who have a problem with Movies In Which People Suddenly Burst Into Song In A Manner Entirely Unlike Real Life have stopped reading already yes? Good. Lets go on.) Based on a London legend of a murderous barber in 19th-century Fleet Street Sondheims musical is a thrilling blend of melodrama throat-slashing devastatingly lovely music and one lonely mans revenge against the world. Sweeney Todd (Depp) formerly Benjamin Barker is a jaded man returned to London after a long banishment. An evil judge (Alan Rickman) has stolen Todds wife and daughter; the wife is gone the daughter held captive. With the help of the cheerily amoral baker Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) Sweeney vows that he will find vengeance -- with his beloved razor blades. ""Because the lives of the wicked should be made brief"" he sings. ""For the rest of us death will be a relief."" (No this isnt ""The Sound of Music."") No summary does justice to the way Sondheims luscious music (gorgeously rendered here by an orchestra far bigger than any stage production could muster) twists around the characters; at times playful at times overwhelming in its emotions. And Burtons film masterfully designed by Dante Ferretti and shot by Dariusz Wolski provides the perfect accompaniment for the score. The colors already in the music so Burtons bleak London is drained of hue; rendered in blacks grays and ghostly whites and punctuated by the occasional river of crimson. Nothing in this world is pretty except the flower-market reverie in which Sweeney remembers his last moments with his wife and child. Colleen Atwoods costumes are dusty and creased as if theyve spent time in a Victorian trunk; the actors makeup is ashen-pale with sooty smudges under their wary eyes. And yes Depp can sing -- but thats almost beside the point. His Sweeney younger and more fragile-looking than the role is usually depicted on stage is a man visibly broken; he looks like hes standing in a colder light and he sings through a sneer that doesnt quite hide his pain. Sweeney cares for no one anymore not even Mrs. Lovett -- who clearly adores him. Bonham Carter gives the widowed baker a devastating vulnerability; shes a practical woman whos allowed herself to fall in love with a man who doesnt even look at her. While her voice is a little too soft and sweet for the role (the comic song ""The Worst Pies in London"" seems beyond her range) her character work is so good that you forget any vocal weakness. The two create a great tragic duo (briefly comic in the darkly merry fantasy sequence ""By the Sea""); theyre meant for each other even as Sweeney cant see it. The beauty of ""Sweeney Todd"" on stage or on screen is that its a melodramatic story played straight; these bloodthirsty characters are human beings whose pain is expressed through exquisite song and who can break your heart even as their actions horrify. Sweeney having slashed a throat as part of his days work gazes at a picture of his lost wife gently touching it with a pale finger. It leaves behind traced on the fading photos glass a rose-red trail of blood.

Its a thoughtful sincere and moving film buttressed by a fine central performance by an actor at the top of his form but one which depends on the viewers indulgence in Haggiss play with genre commitments in favour of wider psychological or even political implications.As such its format is closer to the cinema of moral quest - following such great exemplars as John Fords The Searchers - with aspirations to discuss crises in a country at large through the self-examination of the quester in particular. Thus the most successful scenes are its most domestic and personal watching Jones folding the sheets military-style in his grotty motel close to the army base in Fort Rudd New Mexico to which hes come on an instinct on the news of his sons disappearance. Without spoiling the films revelations Deerfield is soon entering a personal hell caused by institutional and national forces which he is hesitant at first to acknowledge. That Jones is playing a disciplined undemonstrative and straight-speaking man of the old-school - Its the least I could do says a helper. Id say thats correct replies Deerfield - makes the actors careful gradations of stress loss and disillusionment all the more moving.Visually too the film is pleasingly coherent with cinematographer Roger Deakins giving a lonely mournful aura to the seedy army bars and lonely New Mexico backlots while Haggis keeps true to the films domestic vision by restricting shots of foreign conflict to static-filled and scrambled images re-assembled from his sons mobile. Less satisfying is the films incorporation of its female characters - despite fine performances by both Charlize Theron as a police inspector and Susan Sarandon as Deerfields traumatised wife - which undermine the films subtextual interest in what is called the crisis of paternity a theme that runs through much of Haggiss work.

Tommy Lee Jones has the lead role as a father whose soldier- son goes missing shortly after returning from a tour of duty in Iraq. As is often the case our worst fears are soon confimed. What follows is a fathers search for the truth and understanding of a son he thought he knew.. I watched No Country for Old Men before watching this one and again Tommy Lee Jones delivers yet another star perfomance. He is convincing as a grieving father who shows admirable courage in confronting the hard bitter truths about his sons fate. He communicates these emotions in a very accessible way and it is easy to emphathize with him.Charlize Therons turn in this one to me was not all that too convincing She seems to have been miscast in this role although it is clear she is wants roles against-type.Josh Brolin plays a laid-back local sherif who is reluctant to commit his team to an investigation that he knows may be complicated by the fact that the military is involved. The cast is top notch and they offer great support to the leads. Watching this film reminded me of Born on the Fourth of July. It clearly is an anti-war movie but elevates the anti-Iraqi war campaign to a newmore thoughtful level. Susan Sarandon plays the grieving mother . She as expected delivers in this role. I kept wondering what would have been if she had been given more to wrok with here. She has played mother several times to perfection in Step Mom and mother to Natlie Portman. In the Valley of Elah is also simply a story of life and human relationships. The disconnect between the Tommy Lee Jones character and the wife is obvious. The struggle by the Charlize cop character to prove herself before her cynical cop colleagues is a universal story. The movie works on many levels and is worthy time for viewers.

But human behaviour isnt Burtons strong point so one doesnt expect him to gain a strong grip on the psyche of Benjamin Barker - now Mr S Todd (Johnny Depp with a skunks streak in his locks) - the barber whos back in dank Victorian London and looking for revenge on crooked Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman resuscitating his turn in Perfume...) after enduring an unjust stint in a penal colony and losing his wife and daughter. This forlorn figure is now entering a pact with local pie-maker Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter fresh from the Queen Vic) that sees trade blossom for both - and offers Todd a busmans outlet for his anger...Theres something of the Hulk to this Todd (a monster with a heart and a troubled past) but theres a heavy dose of Fred West too. Depp is too young and too beautiful - but he claws back some romance for his anti-hero and proves a capable singer. Its the usual Burtonisms that impress the sets the costumes a masterly embrace of the sound-stage (retaining the theatricality of Sondheims original). Theres a gulf between the colourful leads and the bland supporting roles and Burton struggles to avoid a flat middle section that contrasts with the atmospherics of his opening and the melodrama of his finale - but mostly this is grand-scale studio-work at its most beguiling.

For me as Mr. Todd already mentioned this musical was a whole new experience for me and I am quite shure that this will change my life Even though some scenes are too brutal (my mum told me not to look on the TV when theres blood) there is still enough SWAG inside these captivating minutes of video.

The movie itself has got a different character compared to other movies. This special character makes the movie entertaining and good to watch although some scene are quite brutal. Like ""KingJulien"" already said is a musical in this genre a whole new experience but this special character of the movie makes that the musical type fits to this movie. In the end I wished myself to see more about the future of the daughter and her friend. But nevertheless the movie is in my eyes good but it has got only few beauty mistakes.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 3 2013fan4everFeaturedI really like the film so much because they are all great actors with brilliant voices I liked that the film never got too horrifying and was livened up by funny scenes again and again.

Again drenched with Gothic touches and German Expressionism. H B Carter was fantastic i thought and the music was different to previous Burton films due to the absence of Elfman. I did like the film a new frontier for Depp as a singer.

But I went to see this out of interest because the combination of Depp Burton and Todd was interesting to say the least and I didnt want to go back to my cold flat at that moment.

But unlike more realistic violent fare the gore in this gloomy Gothic marvel feels exaggeratedly theatrical and a vital part of the melodramatic mayhem. Sweeney Todd is the perfect marriage of filmmaker and material. Director Tim Burton has adapted Stephen Sondheims Tony Award-winning musical in a darkly clever and comical fashion. Johnny Depp is ideally cast as the barber who transforms himself from the embittered falsely imprisoned Benjamin Barker to the demonic vengeful Sweeney Todd. Hes undeniably one of the best actors of his generation and there are hints of his past collaborations with Burton in his performance. Youll catch glimpses of Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood and Victor from The Corpse Bride. The production design is intriguingly monochromatic and grimly gorgeous. The musical numbers play out compellingly. Its notable that some of the best musical performances are by actors who are not trained singers such as Depp Alan Rickman (as the nefarious judge who preys upon the barbers wife and daughter) and Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen as Pirelli a flamboyant Italian barber and Todds archrival nearly steals the show. Rounding out the cast is Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. The musical interlude in which she decries her inedible meat pies and rhythmically swats away large insects is a hoot. After escaping from 15 years in prison Barker is intent upon wreaking vengeance on Judge Turpin (Rickman) and his sycophantic henchman Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall) who sent him away on a trumped-up charge in order to steal Barkers wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and baby daughter Johanna. For the rare person who is not familiar with the squeamishly funny plot set in the late 1700s the real fun begins when Barker/Todd panics and slits the throat of Pirelli after he threatens to reveal Todds true identity as an escaped prisoner. Mrs. Lovett ever lamenting the high price of meat sees the fleshy corpse as an opportunity to augment her pie fillings. Thus her meat pie business is rejuvenated as a result of Todds murderous barbering enterprise. The musical crescendos on a wave of witty cannibalistic references including the best production number A Little Priest. Fleshing out the cast is Toby (Edward Sanders) Pirellis former child assistant who ends up helping Mrs. Lovett in her thriving pie establishment. There also is a romance between Johanna (Jayne Wisener) now a young lady and a young sailor (Jamie Campbell Bower). Its an emotional story about the madness of revenge but the romantic elements are a distant second to the tales horrific goings-on. Burtons fascination with the macabre and the mischievous has found a perfect outlet in this lavish Grand Guignol slaughterfest. Sweeney Todd is a bloody good even haunting re-imagining of the Broadway musical with its emphasis on the jugular not the heart.

Sweeney Todd Bloody good | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSweeney Todd Bloody good Its no secret that composer Stephen Sondheim spent a lot of time on the set monitoring Tim Burtons adaptation of the 1979 Grand Guignol musical Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Dec. 21 2007 Starring Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter Alan Rickman Timothy Spall Sacha Baron Cohen. From the musical by Stephen Sondeim and Hugh Wheeler. Directed by Tim Burton. 117 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  Its no secret that composer Stephen Sondheim spent a lot of time on the set monitoring Tim Burtons adaptation of the 1979 Grand Guignol musical Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. But this only makes the issue of the movies considerable excellence - its easily Burtons best since well ever - that much more conspicuous.Article Continued BelowIs Burtons stylized mordant and gleefully bloody adaptation so good because the former animators high artificial style has always aspired to musical theatre anyway? Or did the presence of Sondheim a rather famously uncompromising artist keep the wobbly but talented geek-visionary in focus and on message?Either way Sweeney Todd qualifies as something of a triumph a marvelously misanthropic musical that lands in the middle of the holiday season with the damp thud of one of the barbers victims plunging into the meatpie rendering a two-storey drop below the bloody barber chair.While the movies setting (a charcoal grey gothically decayed and industrially revolted 19th-century London) and theme (of a vengeful outsider played by Johnny Depp) lends itself like a warm bloodbath to Burtons signature tropes and obsessions its the musical element of the enterprise that provides the movies most satisfying departures and slam-dunk success.About five dialogue pages shy of an opera Sondheims musical begins on a low note (sung by a pleasantly voiced and perpetually scowling Depp) and holds it there right to the bloody (very bloody) end. Returning to the vile inferno from whence Alan Rickmans evil magistrate banished him in order to possess the young barbers wife and daughter Burtons Sweeney Todd (who looks like the aging loin-fruit of Edward Scissorhands and Elsa Lanchester) cuts a dashingly pathological figure.As far from the chipper rock n roll pirate thats made him a summer blockbuster fixture as Burtons London is from Mary Poppins Depps Sweeney is a figure of resolute comic dourness. He is utterly incapable of smiling or even taking pleasure from serial acts of arterial severance. The demon barber is such a sourpuss he cant even smile in his co-conspirator Mrs. Lovetts ornately bogus seaside fantasies. And theyre some sick. As imagined by Helena Bonham Carters cheerfully sociopathic death-warmed-over meatpie-maker sunshine never looked quite so disgusting.Although Burtons Todd excises both the stage productions chorus and a couple of its numbers the movie manages to be both faithfully theatrical and swooningly cinematic at once. Evoking Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brechts The Threepenny Opera as well as James Whales studio-bound Frankenstein movies and establishing a visual context thats so lushly realized it makes singing not only logical but arguably necessary Burtons movie is easily the most accomplished entry in the annual pre-Oscar music sweepstakes kicked off by the comparably crude Chicago a few seasons back.Every bit as gory as a movie about murder and meatpies needs to be and yet demonstrating a measure of control that extends from the tip of Depps skunk-streaked up-do to the south-of-hell basement where the bodies drop for culinary preparation Sweeney Todd isnt just an exquisitely executed musical. Its the first to sing the murder ballads of the 21st century.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Sweeney Todd reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sweeney Todd reviewed. Sweeney Todd reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 21 2007 721 AM Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street Revenge is a dish best served in short-crust pastry. By June Thomas Johnny Depp in Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street An R-rated cannibalistic slasher movie might seem like an unlikely vehicle for an ode to family values but Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (DreamWorks Pictures) is a defense of marriage. Plus its riddled with deceit--a keystone of family life. The movies baroque story is set in motion by a cruel deed Corrupt Judge Turpin sends rosy-cheeked barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) to Australia on trumped-up charges so that he can get his hands on Barkers wife Lucy and baby Johanna. Fifteen years later Barker now pallid and sporting a Susan Sontag stripe in his hair escapes and returns to London. June Thomas June Thomas is a Slate culture critic and editor of Outward Slates LGBTQ section. Assuming the name Sweeney Todd he goes to see his former landlady Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter) the proprietor of an unsavory meat-pie shop in Fleet Street. Lovett recognizes Barker and tells him that his wife took poison after being raped by the judge who is now Johannas guardian. She reunites him with his razors and he sets up a tonsorial parlor above her premises all the while plotting revenge. Wondering how to dispose of the body of Adolfo Pirelli a rival barber whose throat he slashed when Pirelli threatened to expose Todds true identity Mrs. Lovett suggests that they turn him--and the gents who come to his shop for a shave--into pies. Once Sweeney Todd tastes blood the operatic plot moves swiftly toward Gotterdammerung. Advertisement The widowed Mrs. Lovett who always had a fondness for the barber has hopes of forming a new family with Todd whose beautiful silver razors she kept safely stowed during his long absence. In the heart-breaking duet ""My Friends"" Mrs. Lovett offers herself to him but he only has eyes for his blades when he sings ""Come let me hold you. Now with a sigh you grow warm in my hand."" Oh yes sings. Sweeney Todd is an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheelers musical and for all but about 10 minutes of the two-hour movie the actors express their often disturbing emotions in song. Listening to Sondheim is a little like experiencing Shakespeare--at first its strange but regular spoken English soon seems anemic. Depp and Bonham-Carter dont have voices that would fill a Broadway house but they dont need them. In the movies its technology not technique that counts--the two actors dont have to belt out the songs so the folks in the balcony can hear them over the orchestra and they dont need the stamina to do eight shows per week with no second chances to hit notes or to negotiate Sondheims complicated meter. The role of Sweeney Todd was written for a bass baritone but Depps rock-star tenor is so gravelly and expressive that he doesnt sound like a lightweight. Bonham-Carters voice is thin but she acts the part convincingly. Listen again to the cast recording of the original 1979 production--Angela Lansbury sings the role in a raucous comic Cockney bray. As pale and slight as Bonham-Carter is--she seems to carry half her weight in her bosom--she anchors the movie. Mrs. Lovetts songs are the toughest in the score and shes the most important character an enabler a co-conspirator and a bit of a Lady Macbeth. Sweeney resists Mrs. Lovetts happy-family fantasy--his mind is set on retribution and his eyes are always focused in the distance. Although Depp plays Sweeney as detached and contemptuous its those eyes that keep his character sympathetic. Alan Rickman is perfectly cast as Judge Turpin--drunk on power evil with the vulnerability of the dim-witted--and in a movie full of effective but not necessarily pretty voices his dulcet tones seem more gorgeous than ever. As Turpins sidekick and procurer Beadle Bamford Timothy Spall with his rodentlike teeth is so smarmy that hes virtually self-lubricating. Director Tim Burton understands that movies are far more intimate than theater--even the deconstructed 2005 Broadway revival of Sweeney Todd where 10 actors multitasked as musicians seems overpopulated compared with this film. You have to be up-close and personal to cut someones throat and Burton creates a Victorian London thats dark and claustrophobic. In trimming down the three-hour musical screenwriter John Logan excised most of the chorus scenes and the quartets and slimmed Johannas and Anthonys parts. Perhaps he shouldve wielded the knife with a little less gusto. In the musical Anthony the sailor is a romantic optimist an essential foil for gloomy Todd. Without the songs that establish his love for Sweeneys daughter Anthonys declaration ""Ill steal you Johanna"" when all hes done is stare at her from afar doesnt seem all that different from Judge Turpin coveting Lucy Barker. The casting also seems misguided. Jamie Campbell Bower is preposterously pretty for the role of the chivalrous sailor--with his flowing blond locks and full lips he wouldnt get much sleep at sea--and Jayne Wisener doesnt have the voice to sell ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird"" Johannas sad song of captivity. She seems more like a China doll than a caged bird. Burton instructed his director of photography to strip color from the film rendering it almost black-and-white--except of course for all that blood. Once Sweeney starts his homicidal streak his barber chair becomes a veritable gusher of the red stuff. Somehow though the endless arterial blood spray has a vaguely Monty Python-ish quality. In our antiseptic food-safety-obsessed times Mrs. Lovetts vermin-infested pie shop and her highly unsanitary food-preparation techniques seem far scarier. Burtons overall restraint is a welcome surprise. Shorn of his usual camp trappings the director evokes a sadness beneath every uneasy smile he draws from the audience. Sweeney Todd isnt Edward Scissorhands a misfit tragically misunderstood by his neighbors hes a man driven mad by injustice. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Photo HANDOUT Review The Perfect Holiday for a single Santa and mom 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Perfect Holiday Romantic comedy. Starring Morris Chestnut Gabrielle Union and Queen Latifah. Directed by Lance Rivera. (PG. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""The Perfect Holiday"" may be far from perfect but the big question is why youre sitting in a movie theater watching it instead of cuddling up at home with the remote in one hand and a steaming toddy in the other. Theres only one reason the cliche-ridden holiday film is in movie theaters and not on say the ABC Family Channel or Lifetime Queen Latifah. The entertainment worlds super multitasker may only have a few cameo frames in the film but shes one of the producers and when the Queen says its going to theaters its going to theaters regardless of the fact that its only marginally better than whatever that Family Channel movie was this week with Mario Lopez and Melissa Joan Hart. Truth to tell ""Perfect Holiday"" is likely to be remembered as the other African American holiday film of 2007 the also-ran to ""This Christmas"" which not only hit theaters first but was also relatively well reviewed by critics and well received by audiences. Directed by Lance Rivera from a script crafted by Marc Calixte Nan Mauldin Jeff Stein and Rivera ""Holiday"" is the story of a would-be songwriter named Ben Armstrong (Morris Chestnut) who takes a part-time job as a department-store Santa where a little girl named Emily (Khail Bryant) tells him that all she wants for Christmas is for someone to compliment her mother Nancy (Gabrielle Union). Emilys overheard Mom say shed like a man to tell her shes beautiful and then walk away. Ben gets a gander at Nancy and decides to make Emilys wish come true by following her into the dry cleaners. Believe it or not this isnt where Ben and Nancy meet cute. That comes a few minutes later and it happens in a candy store. A few minutes after that theyre dating. A few more minutes theyre in love. Meanwhile - and make no mistake in a movie as dependent on a busy plot to hide its lack of originality as this one there are plenty of ""meanwhiles"" - Ben decides he cant tell Nancy hes a songwriter so he pretends to be an office supply salesman. Well of course he does. Meanwhile Part Deux One of his songs is hoovered up by Nancys sleazy ex a big rap star named J-Jizzy (Charlie Murphy) whos also battling to win custody of his kids for the holidays so he can feature them in a TV show. Meanwhile Part Trois Nancys older boy John-John (Malik Hammond) doesnt like Ben because he still hopes his parents will get back together and that blinds him to his dads shortcomings. So Bens got to keep Jizzy from knowing that hes dating his ex-wife he has to keep Nancy from knowing that hes not only a songwriter but also has sold a song to her ex-husband and he has to win John-John over so he can marry Nancy. There are a million other ""meanwhiles"" along the way virtually all of which could be easily explained if Ben acted like any kind of reasonable human being. Of course they all live gooily ever after - you knew that before the animated opening credits have stopped rolling because the movie isnt called ""The Perfect Holiday"" for nothing. Christmas-themed movies more often than not all seem the same because so many of the basic plot and character elements are recycled from one to the next. No matter how stale the material however we often respond on cue anyway because these cliches are pretty Grinch-proof. Despite the flabby direction and uninspired plot ""The Perfect Holiday"" almost works because Chestnut and Union are an attractive couple and you want them to get together. Besides come on its Christmas We all want to feel good at this time of the year no matter how little Hollywood does to earn that feeling. The rest of the cast is pretty good as well especially young Hammond as the grumpy eldest of Nancys kids and Faizon Love as Bens plus-size buddy and Santas biggest elf. Queen Latifah has a kind of recurring cameo role as a quasi-narrator and magicmaker. She shows up in various guises - as a hot dog vender homeless woman security guard - to nudge the inevitabilities of the story line along. Contributing even less and for reasons that make no sense at all is Terrence Howard who plays the anti-holiday Bah Humbug and has all of about six words of dialogue in the entire film. At one point he dresses up as a giant mouse. Maybe if hed kept the headpiece on no one would have recognized him and he could have gotten out of this imperfect film with his reputation intact. Will you get a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye at the end? Of course you will. Its all about Christmas and even the meager presents work their wonders.

BY Jack Mathews Tuesday June 3 2008 356 PM Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Musical about a wrongly imprisoned man who seeks revenge by cutting throats in his barber shop in Victorian London. With Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter. Director Tim Burton (157). R Gory violence. At area theaters.As an operatic black comedy Broadways ""Sweeney Todd"" had few rivals and the gory film version directed by Tim Burton will have fewer still.""Sweeney Todd"" inspired by a centuries-old English urban myth is one of the darkest bleakest and - with the music of Stephen Sondheim - most deceptively jovial musicals ever staged. On film it takes on a grisly verisimilitude as more than a half dozen throats are opened on camera. Since the movie like Burtons ""Sleepy Hollow"" is desaturated of every color but red the arterial spray is all the more dramatic. But if you can handle Burtons near-pornographic rendering of these deeds the movie is both lighter and more filling than one of Mrs. Lovetts meat pies. For the uninitiated Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) owns the building where Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) returns after 15 years in an Australian prison seeking revenge against society and the judge (Alan Rickman ever the villain) who sent him away in order to steal his wife and child. In his upstairs barber shop Sweeney rigs his chair for easy disposal of throat-slit victims whose bodies plop on the basement floor to be ground into meat for Mrs. Lovetts brick oven. This convenient relationship puts Mrs. Lovetts sidewalk restaurant on Londons four-star map and while neighbors may object to the foul emissions from her chimney her customers are moaning ""mmm mmm good."" As Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett settle into their one-way love affair - she wants him he wants blood - his androgynous young sailor friend Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) is trying to rescue Sweeneys now-teenage daughter (Jayne Wisener) from the lecherous clutches of Judge Turpin. Depp may not be a trained singer but his voice is more than passable and his presence - his Sweeney is Edward Scissorhands gone bad - is perfect. Bonham Carter sings well too and young Ed Sanders as the pie shops Dickensian apprentice is a delight. This being Oscar season Id be remiss not to mention that ""Sweeney"" will probably knock ""Hairspray"" out of the race. Too bad; there should be room for both.

It gave me the perversely satisfying feeling that I was hooked to a bag of ice water on an intravenous drip. Hand a grownup classic like Stephen Sondheims Victorian revenge tragedy to a brilliant but immature talent like Tim Burton and theres potential for disaster. Miracle of miracles Rather than reducing the story to a kitschy cartoon the director of ""Batman"" and ""Beetlejuice"" used it to make his most accomplished and adult film to date. His adaptation is darkly beautiful not only in its vivid visuals -- we expect no less from Burtons ornate imagination -- but in the chilling performances and emotional clout of the score. Telling a carefully plotted story has always been Burtons failing; building on Sondheims sturdy foundation hes made a serious adult masterpiece. Theres a current of bitterness and despair even in Burtons lightest comedies and this Victorian melodrama gives him license to dig into those themes without irony. He establishes his command of the story from the opening scene with Todd entering London on a schooner that recalls Nosferatus plague ship. Johnny Depp steps into a claustrophobic closeup with vampire-pale skin and the madhouse eyes of a man hollowed out by rage. Todd establishes the citys claustrophobic nastiness and his own deranged fury in 10 seconds of tightly rhymed harmony ""Theres a hole in the world/ Like a great black pit/ And the vermin of the world inhabit it/ And its morals arent worth/ What a pig could spit/ And it goes by the name of London."" Not the kind of barber youd choose for joshing and sports chat but an eerie oddly sexy antihero for a tale of carnage and cannibalism. Todd is returning to England from Australia imprisoned there on false charges by Judge Turpin (suave lecherous Alan Rickman) who coveted Todds lovely wife. The barber is itching to draw one of his beloved blades across the judges jugular. SWEENEY TODD  out of 4 stars The setup A stunning adaptation of Stephen Sondheims macabre musical starring Johnny Depp as Englands angriest barber and Helena Bonham Carter as his would-be paramour a bake-shop owner in need of cheap meat. What works The film is note-perfect. What doesnt They cut the wonderful songs ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" and ""God Thats Good."" Great scene A dream sequence that puts Depp and Bonham Carter on a sunny seaside vacation. Rating R for graphic bloody violence. Believe it. His opportunistic neighbor bake-shop owner Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonhan Carter) encourages him to take a few practice strokes on other customers and grinds the corpses into tasty fillings for her meat pies. ""Think of it as thrift a gift"" the pragmatic widow sings ""if you get my drift."" Bonham Carter is a comic delight thanks to her matter-of-fact way with gallows humor and knack for smacking her slovenly shops roaches in time to the musical beat. The supporting cast is nothing short of ideal. Timothy Spall with a face straight out of a Dickens illustration is leering sadism incarnate as the judges henchman Beadle Bamford. Sacha Baron Cohen will wipe away all memories of Borat with his menacing turn as Todds barbering rival Pirelli. Even the romantic juveniles Jamie Campbell Bower and Jane Wisener bring power to their roles. Whether the actors sang unaided or their voices were sweetened at the mixing board they sound spectacular. And they excel on camera; these are singing actors not acting singers. Burtons staging of the barbers bloody mayhem involves more splatter than a Gallagher concert; the film fully earns its R rating. Throats open up like hydrants under Todds razor and Burton mixes unnervingly clever theatrics with the bloodletting. The film builds thrilling tension when Depp gently caresses Rickmans lathered face his blade poised to strike while they share a pleasant duet. By all means go and be prepared for a holiday musical like no other. Even the cynically downbeat ""Chicago"" was cheerier than this exhilaratingly pessimistic tale. In this dark operetta no one lives happily ever after.

Burtons film version stays true to his but adds a fresh feel.

With oceans of gore rivers of luscious musicality and a bravura performance by Johnny Depp redolent of malevolence and magnetism Burton brings Sondheims 1979 musical to the screen with a visual style informed by a truly cinematic feel for Grand Guignol. The movie opened Friday in Denver. The added marvel is that the director has crafted a version of a stage musical that completely honors the source without being slavishly devoted to it. By excising choral numbers and highlighting the sorrow inside the sordidness of Sondheims wit-strewn score Burton invites us into a more intimate communion with horrible yet hummable aspects of human nature. Although most of the voices Burton employs to interpret the operatic songs belong to actors rather than to singers Sondheims music -- some of the most exquisite he has ever composed -- does not seem to suffer. The lushly romantic orchestrations by Broadway veteran Jonathan Tunick certainly help. Onstage the coldness and cruelty of ""Sweeneys"" London need to be balanced by the warmth of melodies powerfully delivered. The requirement on the screen however is for the character-driven music to become more seamlessly a partner with the dialogue. That integration has been carried out with surprising effectiveness even in the performance of the extremely thin-voiced Helena Bonham Carter who makes of her Mrs. Lovett -- Sweeneys cannibalistic comrade-in-harms -- a woman less comical than but just as poignant as the Broadway character Angela Lansbury created 28 years ago. It should be noted that the squeamish might find Burtons virtuosic treatment of Sweeneys serial murders -- all in the context of his ""work"" as the demon barber of Fleet Street -- occasions to turn away from the screen. But others will recognize in the slightly distorted consistency and color of what oozes out of everyones necks that we are not in the domain here of chainsaw massacres but art.

"Sweeney Todd is a bloody good show - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGames THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Bloody good With Johnny Depp as the demon barber Tim Burtons Sweeney Todd slashes the songs and ramps up the gore Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd and Helena Bonham Carter in Tim Burtons version of the Stephen Sondheim musical. (Peter Mountain/warner bros pictures) Email|Print| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / December 21 2007 To devotees of Broadway musicals Fear not your beloved ""Sweeney Todd"" has come to the screen relatively intact with most of its songs and nearly all its depravity.To Johnny Depp idolators and anyone else stumbling into the multiplex expecting the further larks of Jack Sparrow This is a musical. More than that in its original form ""Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" was a bloody brilliant musical featuring some of the most glorious melodies in American stage history and some of the most ferocious business. Homicide. Sadomasochism. Incest (sort of). Cannibalism. The kind of show where you go home humming the murders.Which brings me to my third point Everybody bring a raincoat. This thing spurts.What Tim Burton has done to Stephen Sondheims 1979 show is tighten it Gothify it and heighten all the bloodletting that stagecraft can only imply. A Grand Guignol night at the theater has become a full-on horror movie ""Saw"" with a ravaged keening heart. This makes it harder to watch - and may turn it into that rarity a commercial film whose target audiences cancel each other out - but its a conceptual masterstroke. ""Sweeney"" always wanted to be a revengers tragedy to make us recoil in fright. Now it is. Merry Christmas.On a lighter note you want to know if Depp can sing. Im pleased to report that he can - on a lighter note. Turns out hes almost a tenor. As the mad barber of 19th-century London returning from the prison colonies to exact vengeance on the corrupt judge who sentenced him Depp cuts a smart lithe swath through the films visual murk and he hits his notes with ease. Hes not a big Sweeney with a big voice - not an un stoppable bull like the men whove played the part on stage - but rather a cauterized romantic hero. A Tim Burton hero.Todd has crept back into the city accompanied by an idealistic young sailor Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) who spies Todds beauteous young daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and falls in love. Problem She has been the ward of Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman surprisingly low-key) ever since the villain banished her father and ravished her mother (Laura Michelle Kelly in flashbacks). Ickier problem Now the judge wants to marry his ward.In keeping with the blood-and-thunder melodramas on which Sondheim based the play ""Sweeney"" is absurd with plot coincidences mistaken identities purloined purses the lot. It all comes down to revenge and for this a man needs a helpmate Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) the blowsy restaurateur who grinds Sweeneys victims into meat pies and serves them to a hungry unknowing public. ""Whats the sound of the world out there?"" the barber exultingly sings to her. ""Those crunching noises pervading the air?/ Its man devouring man my dear/ and who are we to deny it in here?"" This is Rodgers and Hammerstein devoured by Brecht and the only way it can possibly go down is with black humor and melody. Providing the former are scene-stealers Sacha Baron Cohen (as Signore Pirelli the grinning mountebank who runs afoul of Sweeney; even Cohens pants are funny) and the reliable Timothy Spall as the judges weaselly beadle.Sondheim provides the melodies harsh and enchanting. ""Pretty Women"" the duet between the barber and the judge as one prepares to shave the other is a heart-stopping ode to watching and appreciating - and fetishizing - the fairer sex. The mid-movie reprise of the lyrical ""Johanna"" captures all the major characters in stages of bliss and delusion; its like a fugue for lost souls.Depp is up to the demands of the role; Bonham Carter sadly is not. Burtons wife in real life shes playing to his wispy Goth sensibility again and worse her singing voice is all wrong. Because Sweeney is the dreamer Mrs. Lovett has to be the hard-nosed doer urging her artistic mate toward the practicalities of body removal and such. Shes his manager really but Bonham Carter plays and sings the part with such limp ennui that at times you cant make out what shes saying (a particular crime with Sondheim). Shes an Edward Gorey figure in a Jack the Ripper landscape.There are other pieces missing. Burton working with Sondheim himself has cut all the choral parts (no opening ""Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" alas) half of the show-stopping ""Have a Little Priest"" (with its gleeful descriptions of what type of person would make what type of meat pie) and many of the love songs between Anthony and Johanna. You actually miss the latter since Bower and Wisener arent the handsome stick figures of most stage versions but odd-looking and impassioned. Theyre as misshapen as everyone else here just attractively so.More damaging is the loss of the plays larger message - that what Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett dish out were more than happy to scarf down whether at a restaurant table or in a multiplex seat. The customers no longer bellow ""God thats good"" in the song of the same name; London has ceased to be a cannibalizing character of its own. Star-struck by his homicidal duo Burton lets the dark heart of the matter slip.In its place though he puts blood geysers of it jetting in hot arterial fountains from any number of severed necks. In a movie year steeped in hemoglobin ""Sweeney Todd"" may be the most unrestrained of the bunch. The gore functions as an over-the-top joke but its also a devils bargain insisting that if we want to be entertained by murder we had better confront what it looks like.This is risky business and it brings Burton at least partway out of his shell of chic gloom. Its less distance from Edward Scissorhands to this weary maniac with the gleaming razors than you may think and Sondheims unyielding cynicism - expressed in this one musical more than anywhere else - spurs the director to what may be his most direct and discomfiting movie. ""Sweeney Todd"" comes as close to raging at normalcy as Burton has dared. Its no coincidence that the rage is borrowed from a greater artist.Ty Burr can be reached at tburr globe.com.

For the 15 years he was wrongly imprisoned sentenced by the pious vulture of a London judge who coveted his wife Sweeney Todd (a spectral Johnny Depp as the barber of DeVille) dreamed of slashing said judges jugular. Who knew that Sweeney also fantasized about the geysers of blood that would fountain forth? With Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street Tim Burton gives new meaning to the term ""directors cut."" In adapting Stephen Sondheims dissonant musical into a splatter operetta Burton delivers a movie that might well be too arty for the blood crowd and too bloody for the art crowd. Yet as with all Burton films Sweeney is atmospheric and haunting like a William Blake engraving with Dolby Digital sound. It seeps into your bones like fog. Its tempting to view Sweeney as Burtons song of experience bookend to his song of innocence Edward Scissorhands. With Edward Burton and Depp made a story about a love-hungry boy who couldnt get close to people without hurting them with his blades-for-fingers. Sweeney is the obverse a tale of a hate-sated man who gets close to people in order to kill them. Sweeneys loathing for one man Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman sepulchral as he is sensational) feeds his loathing for all men. A white forelock skunking his black mane Depps Sweeney resembles the spawn of Susan Sontag and Beethoven. As Sweeney he sings in an aggrieved David Bowieish baritone. Not a whit of humor bubbles under Sweeneys black-tar eyes. In Depps Gothic gallery of grotesques Sweeneys is his most cheerless portrait especially when he bellows voice brimming with contempt how full he is with joy. Its the past Sweeney remembers in rosy colors. The present is lived in monochrome relieved only by the occasional burst of blood. Like its central character Sweeneys London is etched in smudgy shades of black and white courtesy of Dante Ferrettis striking production design and Dariusz Wolskis cinematography which makes the movie as theatrically stylized as its stage versions. Separated from his wife and daughter by Turpin Sweeney sings the most macabre love song in the Sondheim canon ""My Friends"" - to his razors. ""Now my arm is complete"" Sweeney declares wriggling blades as if they were fingers. Sweeney enters in professional partnership with a mournful piewoman Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter looking like Depp only with cleavage) who abets his barbery and dreams of becoming his bride. In what Burton frames as a lethal love triangle Mrs. Lovett loves Sweeney; Sweeney loves razors; his razors love Londoners slit and ground into filling for Mrs. Lovetts meat pies. Sondheims morbidly playful lyrics - ""Shepherds pie peppered with actual shepherd"" - do not succeed in lightening the unrelieved darkness of Burtons bleak vision. His movie is a wonder to behold but only those with Burtons acquired tastes would want to sample a pie overstuffed with such joylessness. Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Tim Burton written by John Logan adapted from the musical by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler.

Just about everything actually. Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street director Tim Burtons dark-as-soot take on Stephen Sondheims Broadway musical is all about the atmosphere. And as with any Burton film it has atmosphere aplenty. It also has Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman which never hurts. Carter in particular is wonderful as Mrs. Lovett a dreary lady who makes pies filled with . . . well you really dont want to know. Actually you probably do know what she fills her pies with just as you probably know that Sweeney Todd (Depp) is known for giving particularly close shaves. Sondheims musical is so well known in fact that one might wonder what the point of a film version would be. Wouldnt it inevitably disappoint by comparison? Thats where Burton comes in. Any movie he makes is his and his alone. The look the feel of his films - dark menacing and richly beautiful - are instantly recognizable as much or more than any other directors. And when he teams with Depp - this is their sixth film together - he employs an especially willing accomplice. With Depp wielding razors as if they were extensions of his hands Sweeney Todd is particularly reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands. Yet where that film was all about the heartbreak of not fitting in Sweeney Todd is all about the cold comfort of revenge. Todd returns to London years after being wronged by Judge Turpin (Rickman). He devotes his life to revenge and doesnt care whom he must sacrifice to attain it; the fact that he constantly breaks into song doesnt mean hes merry just that hes in a musical. Ah the songs. Like any songs in a musical theyre broad loud brassy even when theyre dangerous. Think big in other words. Of course the natural question anyone would have is whether Depp can carry a tune. He can kind of. You wont mistake him for Michael Crawford but he doesnt embarrass himself either. Yet the difference between Depp and say Rickman (fantastic as ever) is that you can practically see Depp sweating the singing. To Rickman the singing comes much more easily which makes the character all the more convincing. But the real surprise is Carter. If Depp is an actor who occasionally pauses to sing for Carter the singing and the acting are one and the same one a natural extension of the other. Shes just as funny and just as sad when singing as when speaking. Thats a tougher trick than it sounds. Depp never breaks the mask of gloom and doom. Luckily Carter and Rickman do; otherwise Sweeney Todd would be an unrelenting downer show tunes or no. Also welcome is a really funny performance by Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford Judge Turpins rotund toady. Sacha Baron Cohen also shows up as a rival barber. But Cohen has become so associated with - and rightly so - a singular character that one cant shake the feeling of watching Borat shave a face. A word of warning There will be lots of blood the theatrical ketchup-looking kind. Thatll happen when razor meets throat as often as it does here. But in the end Sweeney Todd is about spectacle - macabre glorious sing-along spectacle a combination for which Burton has no equal.

"Sweeney Todd | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sweeney-todd ) Sweeney Todd (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Every December one of the major studios brings us a musical - something to lighten the spirits and brighten the holidays. This year in the proud tradition of Chicago and Dreamgirls we have Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. With Tim Burton at the helm one has to wonder whether Halloween might have been a better release time. True to its stage nature Sweeney Todd is characterized by a love of the macabre and a cutting wit. Under Burtons direction however its strangely stagnant. The movies lack of energy radiates outward from the low-key songs to the subdued performance by Johnny Depp to the desaturated color employed by cinematographer Dariusz Wolski. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) is the Jack the Ripper of barbers. Wronged by the vile Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who had Sweeney deported so he could steal his wife the haircutter returns with visions of slicing more than sideburns and whiskers. He discovers that his wife is dead and his teenage daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) is Turpins ward. Sweeney makes it a priority to visit his revenge upon Turpin and his assistant Beadly Bamford (Timothy Spall). To this end he employs the aid of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who runs a disused pub under Sweeneys old barber shop. Soon the haircutter is again open for business but those who enter seem not to emerge. Sweeney has opened a trap door in the bottom of his shop and when hes done with customers they are placed into Mrs. Lovetts grinder so they can become the ingredients of her meat pies. Since this is a musical the first thing to discuss is quite naturally the music. Its far from Stephen Sondheims best work but it has nevertheless developed a devoted following over the years. Its tough to develop rousing lyrics about murderers and cannibals. In the movie its odd that the instrumental portions of the soundtrack (those that feature the reverberations of an organ) are more effective than the songs. One has to give Depp and Bonham-Carter credit for doing their own singing but neither has the pipes to really pull this off. Even the most heartfelt refrains lack the zest that we have come to expect from big-screen musicals. Sweeney Todd might have worked just as well with the lyrics changed to spoken dialogue - thats how unremarkable the musical numbers are. (Those who know the songs by heart from the stage musical will argue with me vociferously on this point as one might expect.) Stylistically this is all Burton. In fact one could argue that its Corpse Bride come to life. This is Jack the Rippers London - a place of shadows horror and the grand guignol. Sweeney looks like Captain Jack crossed with Elsa Lancasters Bride of Frankenstein and Depp plays the role pretty much the way he has played every part in his career for Burton. Theres a little Edward Scissorhands here a little Ichabod Crane there and a dash of Ed Wood thrown in for good measure. In contrast to Depps somewhat predictable portrayal Helena Bonham Carter shows gusto for her devious depraved character and Alan Rickman feeds on the evil that never quite bubbles to the surface as Professor Snape. The supporting actors including unknowns like Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower are largely forgettable. I suspect that fans of Sondheims play will be pleased with Burtons screen interpretation of it. He has remained faithful to the essence of the text making trims when necessary but keeping the overall skeleton intact. Those who come to the movie with a fresh set of eyes however may find it possessing a suitably wicked sense of humor but perhaps lacking enough to justify the nearly two-hour running length. There are times when Sweeney Todd feels protracted. This is largely due to the absence of any real show-stoppers. Rather than waiting breathlessly for the next song we view the entire text both spoken and sung as a continuum of variably interesting conversation and exposition. While theres plenty in Sweeney Todd to please the eye theres less here to generate any real sense of enthusiasm. The films bloodiness is suitably over-the-top but as with everything else Burton downplays it to avoid the appearance of campiness. In the end the real problem with the Demon Barber of Fleet Street is that hes not as bloody fun as he should be.

Todays sites are among the many parody Web guides to the conventions. GWBush.com and AlGore-2000.org are only two parody sites slinging shots at the candidates. GWBush.com is themed ""Restoring the throne to its rightful heir"" after ""the reign of George the First was hotly cut short by the upstart from the Ozarks."" The site which attacks more than it satirizes pulls no punches on its George assault doctoring photos offering plenty of video and audio streams and links to dozens of other Bush and political parody Web sites. It also has a George Bush dance with kegs and glasses of beer fashioned after the hamster dance. Moving on to the veep AlGore-2000.org has more yuks than the Bush site but still throws some hard balls. Theres a story and photo about Gores creating ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" the 80s TV hit ""When I came back to Tennessee after serving in Vietnam I bought an orange Dodge Charger and roamed the state with Tipper outwitting state police foiling bad guys and jumping my car off dirt mounds"" Al Gore ""says"" on the Web site. The site chronicles and counters the veeps lies (such as his claim to have invented the Internet and that he and Tipper were the models for ""Love Story""). It also has a quiz ""Did Al Gore say it? Or was it the Unabomber?"" ModernHumorist.com created by the duo who skewered Tina Browns Talk has also jumped into the act. The site will be updated throughout the convention with ""authentic reports from Philadelphia and wildly inauthentic parodies of Republican speeches stickers memos and more.""

As any besotted devotee of Stephen Sondheims 1979 musical-theater masterpiece knows they all do. Die I mean. Thwarted just when he has the throat of the villain he most wants in his hands -- the evil Judge Turpin who sent the then-named Benjamin Barker to prison years earlier on false charges -- the brooding tonsorial artist expands his killing plans to include all who sit in his barber chair. The legend of this grim reaper and the widowed baker Mrs. Nellie Lovett who assisted him by grinding up dead customers into meat pies has been around for over 150 years. But only Sondheims music and lyrics could explain the barbers reasoning so eloquently ""The lives of the wicked should be made brief/For the rest of us death will be a relief."" In other words to stage a proper Sweeney Todd necks must be slit human flesh must be squished into pastries and blood ought to spurt in fountains and rivers of death. Enter Tim Burton who has chopped and kneaded an almost dauntingly famous theater piece into something that stands up to the screen and has tenderly art-directed soup-thick tomato-red fake-gore blood with the zest of a Hollywood-funded Jackson Pollock. Burtons adaptation starring Johnny Depp in the title role and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett isnt the most enduringly classic Sweeney Todd (that would be the original Broadway production with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury) or the most brilliantly original (nothing beats the deconstructed 2005 stunner with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone). Songs have been cut and characters reproportioned in importance (the utilitarian screenplay respectful enough of Hugh Wheelers original book is by John Logan who co-wrote Gladiator). But this opulent attentive production is splashed with signature style and hell-bent on entertaining Sondheimites Deppsters ladies who heart Alan Rickman in the role of the judge and even Borat/Ali G-loving strays who wander in to see an uncontainably antic Sacha Baron Cohen in the role of a blackmailing faux-Italian con man. Its an impossible assignment really carried off with more-than-respectable panache . Indeed the movie is so finely minced a mixture of Sondheims original melodrama and Burtons signature spicing that its difficult to think of any other filmmaker so naturally suited for the job. (Okay Id love to see what American Psycho director Mary Harron would have done but Im sure DreamWorks wouldnt.) What Burton lacks (and I suspect he knows he lacks) in ease when it comes to directing fully liberated glee real fear and dangerous hilarity he steadfastly attempts to make up for with compensatory floods of visual verve. Plus he gets Depp Bonham Carter Rickman and even Baron Cohen to sing. Oh Captain Jack Sparrow gone to the really really dark side Burton has an affinity for the mayhems Grand Guignol setting of course. But more valuably he has a unique collaborative relationship with his longtime leading man. And painted in chalky pallor and drop-dead under-eye shadows out of the Pirates of the Caribbean?Edward Scissorhands makeup bag Depp propels the production through sheer graceful grit of stardom. He emphasizes the mourning mans melancholy (he misses his lost wife and the daughter whos now the hideous judges ward) with a cold Sleepy Hollow ghostliness rather than a hot iniquities-of-the-world fury. Depp is a decent enough singer in a cast for whom vocal prowess isnt job No. 1 or even job No. 5 but singing almost doesnt matter not while hes around Hes the most interesting person on the screen and the demon barber he conjures is a fascinating interpretation. As for Mrs. Lovett she truly is a woman of ""limited wind"" as Sondheim describes her and Bonham Carter sings her in a thin breathy voice -- its difficult to believe that this particular bloody wonder can lift a rolling pin let alone crank the handle on her hellish meat-grinding machinery. Its nice though how Bonham Carters corpse-bride complexion complements Depps; how Rickmans sadistic Judge Turpin oozes real erotic heat not just twisted sexual tastes; and how honorably a big studio has er stuck its neck out to do right by one of the great American artistic creations of our time.

The second is that its bloody wonderful. Emphasize bloody. The title character has a few anger-management issues. Sweeney is a revenge-obsessed Victorian London serial killer who slits the throats of his victims as they sit in his barber chair. The bodies are then dumped in the cellar ground up and served as meat pies in the shop of Mrs. Lovett his partner in crime. These murders which transpired from an almost comic Brechtian distance in Hal Princes original stage production become something else in Burtons loving close-ups. The highly stylized blood doesnt just ooze it spurts and sprays like water from a garden hose. All of this accompanied by some of the most beautiful witty and disturbing songs in the musical-theater canon.""Sweeney"" is not always easy to watch but you cant turn away. From our first glimpse of Johnny Depps haunted vengeful eyes as the ex-convict barber sails into London on a mission to kill the man who stole his wife and child and sent him off to prison were swept into Burtons pitch-black vision. It meshes perfectly with the bitter curl of Sondheims lyrics. Burton isnt interested in class warfare or the industrial-age political metaphors that Prince emphasized onstage his ""Sweeney"" from John Logans adroit screenplay is an up-close-and-personal tale of blighted passions and dark obsessions. It has an emotional intimacy that allows you to see the work with fresh eyes. The object of Todds rage is the evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) a villain right out of a 19th-century melodrama. Todd learns that while he was serving his time his wife poisoned herself and his now grown daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) became Turpins captive ward whom he aims to marry. Theres a romantic subplot in which Todds traveling companion the young sailor Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) falls in love with Johanna which remains the lamest most conventional aspect of the story. The pretty Wisener and prettier Bower are decorative and not much else.The rest of the cast however could hardly be better. No one will claim this is the most beautifully sung ""Sweeney Todd"" hes ever heard but thats not the point they act the songs with hair-raising conviction. This anti-hero may have a one-track mind--he cant see anything beyond the rage that drives him--but Depp is such a soulful presence he gives you a glimpse of this maniacs pain and pathos. Bonham Carter is extraordinary. She reinvents Mrs. Lovett from the inside out--underneath her tough practical hussy lurks a haunting melancholy the yearning of a woman in love with an unreachable man sucked into his madness in the vain hope hell open his black heart to her. Sweeneys idea of a love song however is the inspired ""My Friend"" a passionate serenade to his barbers blades--hes like a twisted Edward Scissorhands in love with his own metallic fingers. Sacha Baron Cohen (a.k.a. Borat) makes a delicious scene-stealing appearance as the charlatan barber Pirelli who makes the fatal mistake of trying to blackmail his rival. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The performances are pitched at just the right scale theatrically exaggerated but untainted by ""Broadway"" bombast. Who knew Burton would have such an uncanny feel for how to film a musical? His strength has never been storytelling--his Gothic imagination flowers episodically--but ""Sweeney Todd"" his best movie since ""Ed Wood"" keeps its eye on its dark prize. It has the relentless forward momentum of a shark in blood-stained waters.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Both sharp and fleet ""Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" proves a satisfying screen version of Stephen Sondheims landmark 1979 theatrical musical. Where much could have gone wrong things have turned out uniformly right thanks to highly focused direction by Tim Burton expert screw-tightening by scenarist John Logan and haunted and musically adept lead performances from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Assembled artistic combo assures the film will reap by far the biggest audience to see a pure Sondheim musical although just how big depends on the upscale crowds tolerance for buckets of blood and the degree to which the masses stay away due to the whiff of the highbrow. In all events DreamWorks-Paramount and Warner Bros. have a classy and reasonably commercial delicacy on their hands. The composer-lyricists bulging shelf of awards and peerless reputation notwithstanding Sondheims own shows have never invited much bigscreen interest no doubt due to the general feeling that they are works from and for the head rather than the heart. The two films that were made from his musicals ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and ""A Little Night Music"" were to put it kindly hardly representative of the effect the shows had onstage. Some Broadway purists will gripe about how the film of ""Sweeney Todd"" omits and abridges certain songs reshapes the drama to a degree or just cant measure up to their cherished memories of Angela Lansburys wondrous performance as Mrs. Lovett. But it will be hard to argue that Burton and his cohorts have not imaginatively reconceived the piece as a work of cinema; strictly in film terms ""Sweeney"" is seamless coherent and vibrant with scarcely a trace of ""Broadway."" The flip side of these virtues is that the immaculately designed settings and lack of breathing room lend the film a claustrophobic feel that underlines its status as an art work. Other qualitative considerations to the side this aspect makes ""Sweeney Todd"" most recall the much-debated ""Evita"" among screen versions of post-60s musicals. Eschewing trademark mannerisms and flights of fancy and yet fully imprinting the film with his signature Burton strongly delivers the dark core of this story of a lower-class London barber whose thirst for revenge against a venal judge gives birth to a prodigious serial killer. Yarn has questionable real-life origins in the 18th century but came to prominence as a story and a stage drama in the mid-19th century and in 1973 served as the inspiration for the Christopher Bond play that attracted Sondheims attention. As Sweeney Todd (Depp) sails up the Thames with a young man Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) having escaped from prison in Australia his bitterly ironic commentary in ""No Place Like London"" firmly defines the side of the city the film will occupy; in production designer Dante Ferrettis superb realization it is a squalid place of narrow streets and dingy rooms. Evoking old Hollywood horror pics Burton has made something very close to a real black-and-white film as Ferrettis sets the extensive CGI backgrounds Dariusz Wolskis lensing Colleen Atwoods costumes and the pale makeup are synchronized to permit only traces of bold color -- mostly red -- to accent a world dominated by shades of gray blue white and black. Sweeney Todd returns with the single-minded intention of killing Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman as deliciously sinister as fans know he can be) who locked him up on false charges so he could make off with the younger mans lovely wife Lucy and young daughter. Installed in a room above a dismal pie shop run by his slovenly long-ago landlady Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) Sweeney has his desire for payback sharpened by the news that Lucy killed herself out of distress and Turpin is now romantically inclined toward Sweeneys now-teenage daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) who coincidentally catches the eye of the naively romantic Anthony (Campbell Bowers screen future seems assured thanks to looks so striking that they distract one from looking even at Depp). Sweeneys murderous career commences to the detriment of a fellow barber charlatan and con artist Adolfo Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen) following a public musical ""duel"" to determine who in London can administer the quickest closest shave. Cohen in his first screen appearance since ""Borat"" makes the most of this brief but expansive supporting role broadly playing the braggart showman with as required two different accents and highly colorful costumes. Mrs. Lovett a widow who signals her enduring love for Sweeney by having carefully kept his collection of gleaming razors through the years makes a quick moral adjustment to her boarders bloody enterprise by using his victims flesh in her meat pies which brings her business roaring back to life. All the while Judge Turpin and his malevolent henchman Beadle Bamford (an unctuous gruesomely toothsome Timothy Spall) frustratingly elude Sweeneys clutches; once theyre on to him and Anthony the virtuous Johanna is thrown into an asylum while Mrs. Lovett begins entertaining delusions of happily-ever-after domestic bliss with Sweeney. Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler fashioned a darkly effective morality tale out of this descent into madness one Logan has elegantly whittled down to two hours from three to satisfy the more concise specifications of the screen. Dialogue is present when needed but the vast majority of the text and drama is conveyed via the songs which themselves have sometimes been shortened -- with verses removed -- with little loss in impact. Burton stages the singing sequences with precision and fluidity; as most of them are intimate one-or-two-person affairs and not production numbers in the traditional sense he approaches them as he would dramatic scenes in degrees of closeup and with an emphasis on content and forward movement. Music has always played a major role in his films (notably in his previous pic ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") and this represents one happy instance of a film made by a director without stage experience that genuinely serves the intentions of the original piece. Heavy curiosity will center on how Depp in particular manages the vocals (all the actors performed their songs themselves). The answer is perfectly well thank you. The ever-resourceful thesp doesnt take the half-measure of sing-speaking in the manner of Rex Harrison or Richard Burton but puts across his many numbers with an agreeable voice that effectively registers the lyrics import. The same goes for Bonham Carter a similarly untrained vocalist who works in the same vein of successfully acting her role through song. There is deeply buried emotion and charged motivations in both characters that Depp and Bonham Carter consistently express and the eerie similarity of their looks -- the endlessly dark eyes cascading black hair delicate facial structure sunken cheeks exaggerated lips slight stature -- accentuates the characters complicity; at one point they are both so pale they look like theyve been done up in whiteface. Another effective connection is made between Sweeney and his mortal enemy Rickmans hanging judge; both express the view and justify their predisposition for meting out severe punishment that all men have done something in their lives that make them deserve to die. It is certainly true of the two of them no matter that one is the antihero and the other the villain of the piece. The narrow heavily deterministic and yes gushingly bloody nature of the show (more than enough to warrant its R rating) serves to mute the exhilaration to a degree but producers Richard Zanuck Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald (and Sondheim who had approval of the director and actors) deserve credit for ensuring that everyone involved on the picture was the right person for the job.
