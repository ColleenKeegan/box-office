"`Undiscovered is a cheesy lark -- bring crackers and enjoy - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Fame `Undiscovered is a cheesy lark -- bring crackers and enjoymovies - reviewAugust 26 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie Critic""You want fame?"" Debbie Allen used to preach on TV. ""Well fame costs. And right here is where you start paying. With sweat.""And a plane ticket. To Los Angeles. Because to make it in music or TV or the movies L.A. is where the young the beautiful and the ambitious need to be.Theyre all rock stars movie stars or TV phenomena in the making. Theyre just Undiscovered.Pell James and Steven Strait star in this end-of-summer trifle about a model who just wants to act and a songwriter who wants to play because ""Its all about the music man.""This young-love/young-ambition soap opera has a cute kind of grit about it. Its like the pilot for a Fox series during the age of 90210 and The Heights and its aimed at an audience too young to remember those cultural ""milestones.""Boy meets girl -- sort of -- on the New York subway.He drops a glove. She picks it up and calls to him.But shes on a train. The doors are sliding shut.And he does the most selfless romantic thing. He tosses her the other one.Of course theyre fated to meet again. A year will slip by and miles will pass as Luke moves to Los Angeles and by golly Luke will wear out that videotape his goofy brother shot of his last day in NYC and almost meeting the girl of his dreams on the subway.Because this is true love. And if hes waiting to be signed to a record label sooner or later the model will say ""I wanna try acting"" and move to Los Angeles. They all do.The romance never quite ticks over because well shes had one rock star boyfriend and thats enough. Hes sensitive in that Michael Hutchence sort of brooding brunet alterna-rocker way. Thats no guarantee of fame.But then Briar (James) and her new best pal Clea played by Ashlee Simpson conspire with Briars supermodel super-agent aunt (Carrie Fisher) to create buzz for Lukes band.Fisher Stevens goofing on the idea of what a record company Aamp;R man is like is conned into signing Luke. And theres your fame right?Not quite.Theres almost no script here. We dont spend much time in acting class or on auditions or photo shoots or in bars or doing recording sessions. The movie loses track of more stuff than it keeps track of.But its not hard to see what old pros Fisher and Stevens and Peter Weller saw in this. It may be a cheesy lark but life bubbles through the cheese.Music-video director Meiert Avis uses hand-held cameras lighting and a bag full of throw-away moments to make this worth a matinee admission even if youre not 16.Lukes bulldog rides a skateboard down to Venice Beach every day with him. His brother played by Kip Pardue is a busker a street musician who goofs around in cover bands playing for strippers.Funny stuff. And we see parts of Los Angeles we havent seen in 400 earlier movies.If the kids show up for this itll be for the hot young cast. But from the looks of this the director is the real Undiscovered talent.

Comments Undiscovered With character names like Luke Falcon and Wick Treadway this showbiz romance dangles the promise of a Showgirls-style debacle but it isnt bad enough to be good. A model turned actress (the beautiful Pell James) falls for a struggling musician (the beautiful Steven Strait) and uses her industry connections to create some fake buzz for him. As usual in movies like this hes supposed to be the real thing but his tunes are all studio-buffed MOR.

Updated July 30 2016  355 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Buy amp; Sell It should stay ""Undiscovered"" Hype-filled film is lame even by primetime soap standards CHRISTY LEMIREAP Movie Critic Aug 26 2005 ""Undiscovered"" feels more like a pilot for a glossy nighttime soap on Fox -- probably one that would be canceled midseason -- than a feature film with even a modicum of discernible originality or depth. A gaggle of hip pretty people all aspiring actors or singers or musicians prowl around Los Angeles where theyre photographed with suitably edgy hand-held camerawork and swathed in the flattering glow of neon light. (Director Meiert Avis has shot videos for Jennifer Lopez and U2 and it shows.) They go on auditions they hang out at the Viper Room. Magically they can afford apartments at the beach. Some of them are attracted to each other. All of them get their back stories out of the way with expository dialogue like ""His work defies classification ... he wants to make it but on his own terms."" But ""Undiscovered"" is too inert to be titillating too generic to be engaging. It toys with probing the idea of how easy it is to manufacture hype (which is appropriate since Ashlee Simpson is one of its stars) but then first-time screenwriter John Galt seems to forget what he was getting at and falls back on romance-flick conventions complete with a climactic mad dash to the airport. ""Undiscovered"" could have been onto something with Luke (Steven Strait) the bad-boy singer-songwriter with a heart of gold who experiences a brief flash of fame and struggles to stay grounded. He gains an emaciated Brazilian model (Shannyn Sossamon in a blonde wig vamping it up) and undergoes a makeover that leaves him resembling late INXS singer Michael Hutchence and in the process neglects his older brother Euan (Kip Pardue). Little does Luke know that the buzz was fabricated -- through blogs photographs and well-placed phone calls -- by friends Brier (Pell James) and Clea (Simpson whose father Joe is one of the movies executive producers hence we are forced to watch her get up on stage and sing a lot). Brier and Luke had crossed paths on the subway in New York -- where she was a model with dreams of being a model-actress -- and end up meeting again at a club in L.A. where Luke is performing his signature brand of frat-boy rock. Both are fantastic-looking -- in case we hadnt noticed we get to watch them take trapeze lessons together ostensibly to allow us to ogle them in tight clothing -- but too vapid to create any real sparks. Bafflingly Carrie Fisher shows up and at least she provides some much-needed humor and substance as Briers New York-based agent. She gives Brier useful tips before the innocent young blonde leaves for Los Angeles like ""Stay off the 405 whenever possible."" Thats good advice. Heres some more Stay away from movies like ""Undiscovered"" whenever possible. onscreen ""Undiscovered"" Grade D+ Starring Steven Strait Pell James Ashlee Simpson Carrie Fisher Director Meiert Avis Rated PG-13 for sexual material including dialogue partial nudity language and drug content Latest in section Kelly Ripa not saying who shed like as new Live co-host Game of Thrones to end after season 8 but 7th still ahead Game of Thrones to end after season 8 but 7th still ahead Outrage caution from Latino stars in critical election year Congo musician accused of assault is provisionally released Movie Showtimes | PrettyFamous Most Popular on nwi.com Fired prosecutor said she did not intend any wrongdoing UPDATE Gary infant didnt have body fat when he died Retired Hammond firefighter dies in boating accident Dozens of alleged Latin Kings members indicted West Calumet residents advised to relocate because of lead Currents +19 National Sports Photo Galleries Gallery Brewers power past Cubs +6 World News Heres why Islamic State terrorists prefer to target France Television The 10 best TV shows you should watch without your kids Todays top pics DEM Convention comes to close and more Dog missing nearly 7 years reunited with family in Texas Your daily 6 Somber stop at Auschwitz cop killed in San Diego and Hillarys history Today In History July 29 Adolf Hitler Hues Turn coach Jackson determined to rebuild bad Browns Australias Penny Taylor set to retire at end of WNBA season Athletes in Rio Olympics refugee team luckier than many Saints Payton wary of wearing players out at training camp 146 Ndn AP video Despite wins in Wisconsin road to nomination still steep for Ted Cruz Bernie Sanders 205 Ndn AP video Young refugees in US inspired by Olympics 201 Ndn AP video Homeless New York City sisters head to Junior Olympics 046 News Raw video People flee Germany mall shooting Find local businesses View local offers Local Businesses Andy Koultourides DDS Ridge Dental Care 619 Ridge Rd Munster IN 46321 Dream Big Gymnastics 6575 Daniel Burnham Drive Suite E Portage IN 46368 Legacy Group 1910 Melbrook Court Munster IN 46321 Crusader Homes 2405 Pennington Place Valparaiso IN 46383 Business Directory Latest Local Offers Lawn Doctor of West Lake County The path to a beautiful green lawn starts with a call to the Lawn Doctor of West Lake County.

Share Tweet The vapid teen talent show Undiscovered turns on a plot point so moronic that even the most dedicated bad-movie buffs have cause to stay away When anonymous rock-star wannabe Steven Strait appears in a staged photo with a popular Brazilian supermodel hes somehow instantly transformed into one of the hottest most buzzed-about musicians in L.A. Granted in order to work its magic the photo must first appear on the New York Posts Page Six and be disseminated on the Internet which has a funny way of acquiring awe-inspiring godlike powers whenever screenwriters need it to. If overnight stardom were that easy to finagle a lot of publicists would be out of work but Undiscovered gives little indication that its even on speaking terms with the antiquated notion of believability. The bland romance the bland in Undiscovered as Strait--whose bleating witless music is optimistically described as Elvis Costello meets Jeff Buckley--tries to woo model-turned-aspiring-actress Pell James who lingers in a one-sided relationship with a philandering rock star with a fetish for twins. James Barnum-esque PR chicanery helps turn Strait into the hot new thing but can he resist the temptations of nascent rock stardom? Undiscovered would like to think of itself as a gritty documentary-style indie about hopefuls on the fringes of the industry but its more like one of those lame hair-metal bands that went out and bought flannel shirts after Nirvana hit it big. Though its take on music pop culture and young people is fuzzy and misguided the film couldnt be called cynical. Undiscovered take place in an irony-free zone and it genuinely believes in all its time-tested cliches and banalities to the point where its quaking sincerity becomes both strangely compelling and borderline pathetic. Undiscovered provides a fantasy for those hopeless young dreamers who move to L.A. with visions of stardom and fame utterly unaware that theyre guppies in Hollywoods shark tank. No matter how much they believe in themselves or follow their dreams odds are good they wont succeed. Neither does Undiscovered. It doesnt even come close.

Brier Tucket (Pell James) the stranger in the red coat he locked eyes with through the closing subway door makes it to the coast too - two years later.At a club wheres hes emo-ing mightily at the piano and shes in a booth with her acting-class friends their eyes lock again. Its love at first sight or OK second sighting but can it survive the pressures and pains of rock stardom and international modeling assignments?Thats the big question in Undiscovered an enjoyably cheesy teen melodrama with a touch of indie edge. Featuring Ashlee Simpson in a supporting role as a hipster thespian-songstress (yes she sings) and cameos from Carrie Fisher (modeling-agency mother hen) Fisher Stevens (music-mogul parody) and Peter Weller (Hemingway-quoting cool guy) the obstacle-strewn romance from videomaker-turned-director Meiert Avis is like a Hilary Duff flick without the Duffer.In lieu of the tween pop idol Undiscovered stars the reedy James who has lovely moles and must convey all sorts of angst as she struggles not to fall for Luke - because once hes famous hell be swarmed by groupies and parasites. Strait who wears his hair in a ponytail and his pecs in proud prominence (he has more cleavage than James) radiates hunky earnestness - and sings the songs which arent half bad.Shannyn Sossamon vamps it up as a Brazilian hellcat brought on board to create some ""buzz"" for Luke and Simpson is sweet and wool-cappy as Luke and Briers best friend. She brings the two together and then looks on with a mopey twinkle in her eye.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Undiscovered 1/2 (out of four stars)Written by John Galt directed by Meiert Avis.

"Undiscovered And Really Not Worth Looking For washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Undiscovered And Really Not Worth Looking For Pell James plays a model who moves to Los Angeles to become an actress and eventually meets Steven Strait a struggling musician and uh forget it. (Photos By Chuck Zlotnick -- Lions Gate Films) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 26 2005 I was going to say this in last weeks review of ""Asylum"" but I held off knowing that we still had 4 1/2 months to go and that it was early yet to make such categorical statements. Im glad I demurred because it turns out that ""Undiscovered"" just may be the dumbest movie of 2005. Surely some D-list stalking horse will steal that title some time in October but for now well let the title stand (and give the reportedly dismal ""The Cave"" a pass). All comers be warned To match or beat ""Undiscovered"" for banality boredom and sheer badness youll have to assemble an improbably gorgeous cast of mactors and mactresses (thats model-actors and -actresses to the uninitiated) and force them to lend credence to a script whose dialogue is as cheesy as its plot is contrived. ""Undiscovered"" about a group of young performers trying to make it in Los Angeles is sort of a cross between HBOs ""Unscripted"" and your garden-variety Gen X TV show. Indeed Id say ""Undiscovered"" belongs on the WB but that would be gravely unfair to the channel which looks like the BBC in comparison. The story at hand hinges on a young mactress named Brier Tucket played by Pell James in a weirdly smirking way-too-cute performance who moves from New York to L.A. to break into Hollywood; with a copy of ""An Actor Prepares"" snugly ensconced in the pocket of her 165 jeans she befriends a ragtag group of gutsy newcomers who in turn introduce her to a struggling musician named Luke Falcon (the terrific Steven Strait recently seen in ""Sky High""). Gushes Briers best friend played by the chipmunk-voiced paptress -- thats pop star-actress -- Ashlee Simpson ""Hes kind of like a cross between Jeff Buckley and Elvis Costello."" A word to the wise Hes not. The two girls soon hatch a plot to create a media buzz around the guitar-playing hottie and naturally their plan works all too well. (Inexplicably aiding and abetting the co-conspirators are some grown-ups who should know better played by actors who should know better Carrie Fisher Fisher Stevens and Peter Weller.) When the fame and the money and the groupies all inevitably come crashing down around Lukes carefully un-coiffed head one of the adorable co-conspirators is actually heard to wail ""All we tried to do was make a nice guy a rock star"" Mwah Make it stop ""Undiscovered"" which has been perpetrated on the unsuspecting public by a writer named John Galt and a (why is this not a surprise?) music video director named Meiert Avis goes to shameless lengths to make itself interesting including some ridiculous scenes at a batting cage and an amateur trapeze school; when things get really desperate the filmmakers insert a shot of a skateboarding bulldog. Finally as Brier and Luke prettily make their way to a risible climax their day is saved by Wick Treadway a Chris Blackwell-like music executive with a name only Baba Wawa could love. Unbewievable just like the rest of ""Undiscovered"" which with any luck will quickly disappear unnoticed unseen and unmourned. Undiscovered (97 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual material including dialogue partial nudity profanity and drug content.

Running time 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexual situations partial nudity profanity drug use). At the Empire the Union Square the 84th Street others. SHES a model. Hes a rocker. Worlds apart How will these two crazy kids ever get together? I always thought people became models and rock ers so they could hook up with each other. ""Undiscovered"" tells me Im wrong The gorgeously lissome model Brier and the gorgeously shaggy rocker Luke cant get together because shes sworn off guys in bands. But the movie never tells us who models are supposed to date if they give up rock stars. Film critics? Luke is a struggling musician who plays small clubs in L.A. while Brier the model keeps attending his gigs going for romantic walks with him meeting his skateboarding bulldog and insisting they cant be a couple. Her current beau is a Brit rocker called Mick and whenever she calls him his giggling groupies answer the phone so she wants to break the pattern. Though she sorta cant stand to break up with Mick in the first place. The story is obvious at best preposterous at worst. In a key plot twist - just about the only one - a savvy Aamp;R scout is tricked into signing Luke because the rocker gets lots of cheers from friends who pack his gigs. Meanwhile Luke becomes a name because Brier and her pals amateurishly spread his name around town and the Internet. (There are battalions of trained pros who try this and they fail more often than not.) When Brier gets her agent (Carrie Fisher) to flack a picture of Luke the agent barks out ""Since Im giving Page Six this exclusive this layout better be splashy."" A Hollywood agent giving orders to Richard Johnson? Not likely. If the story is rote the dialogue keeps telling us what it ought to show and often crosses that fine line between clever and stupid. When Luke dates a hot-blooded Brazilian model his brother calls her ""that South American wom bat."" Wombats arent South American. Also theyre fat gentle slow creatures. So where did the wombat men tion come from - a random noun generator? But theres an exceptionally ap pealing young cast of newbies; credit first-time director Meiert Avis who comes to the screen from music videos with keeping everyone looking relaxed. In her first starring role Pell James is ador able and winsome as the model. Shes a romantic-comedy star in the making. As her chiseled but sensitive opposite number Luke Steve Strait (""Sky High"") looks like the next teen heart throb. Hes got a mammoth Tom Cruise grin and he does his own singing in an Eddie Vedder growl. Many of the supporting actors are excellent too particularly Peter Weller as an aging hipster record exec; Stephen Moyer who looks like a degenerate Tom Brady as Mick the rocker; and even Ashlee Simpson who shows real potential as Briers sidekick. Hunched under a knit cap and casting her enormous eyes downward Simpson gets more sly and intriguing the more she retreats from us. And her voice - as suming that is her voice - is a sexy Demi Moore rasp. Avis makes the most of a feeble script highlight ing strange little moments like the one in which Mick visits the batting cage where Brier goes to hit baseballs to woo her with a box of Ho Hos. Like many music-video directors Avis cant leave the camera alone. He swoops and jives through the most banal pages of dialogue plays incessantly with the focus and slashes from one unnervingly tight close-up to the next. But all of this serves to wipe the gloss off a WB Network-style story and make it intimate and real. ""Undiscovered"" is for teens who havent had their dreams of becoming models and rockers crushed out of them yet. It isnt a really good movie but theres real talent in it.

Photo credit Chuck Zlotnick Lions Gate Publicity Photo Chuck Zlotnick Unfortunately his music truly is as bad as it sounds 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Undiscovered Drama. Starring Pell James Steven Strait Kip Pardue and Ashlee Simpson. Directed by Meiert Avis. (Rated PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Before considering ""Undiscovered"" viewers must first decide whether they can stand Ashlee Simpson people who sing with their eyes closed and midfilm montages that feature flashbacks from the first half of the same movie. Because this new film about struggling performers in Los Angeles packs all three into the same scene. And while those four minutes are by far the most insidious part of an often harmless product the movie plays more like a WB network teen drama than something audiences should be expected to pay to see. ""Undiscovered"" is a film about a great songwriter and it contains horrible songwriting. Steven Strait is Luke Falcon an aspiring musician who moves from New York to Los Angeles. The choice to let him perform his characters songs is questionable -- he sounds like ""Hootie amp; the Blowfish"" lead signer Darius Rucker except more constipated -- and the songs themselves are terrible. As audiences suffer through what seems like a dozen music videos strung together theres no indication that Falcon deserves the fame that comes to him. When the stray record executive spouts out an earnest ""hes really not that bad that kid"" or ""hes a damn good songwriter"" you have to take their word for it. As bad as the scenes are where Strait performs hes a minor distraction compared with Simpson who for no good reason walks through this movie dressed like the Judd Nelson character in ""The Breakfast Club."" Not only is her singing an unholy torture that audiences undoubtedly wont be prepared for but shes given lines (""Luke has integrity -- he wants to make it but on his own terms"" and ""I dont think you fall out of love until you fall into someone else"") that would sound amateurish coming from Meryl Streep. Things get much better when the music stops and the dark and handsome Falcon romances model-turned-actress Brier Tucket played by Pell James. Both actors are frighteningly good looking and they have decent chemistry. The closest thing to an original plot twist comes when Brier uses media manipulation to make Falcon famous -- even as she repels his advances -- and the results are somewhat amusing. ""Undiscovered"" is directed by Meiert Avis and if you look up how many videos hes made (including 10 for U2) the film starts to make sense. Towhead actor Kip Pardue also shows up as the Edge to Straits Bono providing comic relief and moral support as Lukes brother. Not since the TV show ""Simon amp; Simon"" left the air have two siblings looked so completely and totally not of the same womb. But at least in the scene where Pardue sings hes lip-synching a decent Steve Miller song. -- Advisory This film contains some adult language and sexual situations. Ashlee Simpsons voice may be hazardous to people with heart problems high blood pressure and extreme sensitivity to bad pop music.

Pretty young things are rendered skin-deep and unable to love each other even though everyone knows theyre the perfect match. What may have been originally conceived as a significant project has ended up pallid and will quickly exit from theatrical gigs. As a cautionary drama on the price of fame ""Undiscovered"" could not tread on more exhaustively discovered territory and the result is a reel-by-reel trail of cliches. Pretty young things -- he a solemnly serious songwriter thrust into rock stardom and she a Gotham model-turned-wannabe thesp -- are rendered skin-deep and unable to love each other even though everyone knows theyre the perfect match. What may have been originally conceived as a significant project has ended up pallid and will quickly exit from theatrical gigs. In an opening moment recalling ""Closing Doors"" model Brier (Pell James) draws songwriter Lukes (Steven Strait) attention at the door of a New York subway train and he tosses her his winter gloves. Soon Luke bids farewell to his goofy musician brother Euan (Kip Pardue) and sets off to Los Angeles where he hopes his career can be kick-started. Meanwhile Brier suffering the serial infidelities of rocker b.f. Mick (Stephen Moyer) suggests a move to the City of Angeles to test her acting bug to her manager Carrie (Carrie Fisher). All too easily Brier lands a spot in an acting class at the Lee Strasberg Institute in L.A. scores a long-term residency at the Chateau Marmont and spots Luke gigging at the Mint. Luke even knows Briers fellow student and new pal Clea (Ashlee Simpson). Los Angeles as depicted in ""Undiscovered"" is a tiny neighborhood composed of nothing but clubs struggling yet beautiful young people and fat-headed showbiz grownups who talk like used-car salesmen. Latter would be record producer Garrett Schweck (Fisher Stevens) so obviously insincere and obnoxious that no real artist like Luke described as a ""combination of Jeff Buckley and Elvis Costello"" would ever get within spitting distance of him. John Galts script is soon desperate for an angle however so Brier hatches a scheme to ""stage"" buzz for Luke. The scheme includes hiring a slinky woman (Shannyn Sossamon) to pose as a date for Luke while Brier half-heartedly insists Luke isnt for her. Briers feelings have something to do with no longer trusting musicians but nobody believes it and neither will viewers who will see the creaky dramas roller-coaster patterns of fame and betrayal and self-renewal long before they happen. Musicvid director Meiert Avis works best arranging solid musical performances (especially for Strait) but appears lost as a helmer of narrative cinema. All the weight is on Strait and James who both look fine and seem to feel comfortable as leads but who cant find the emotional range needed to humanize their stereotyped roles. James character is especially weak since once Brier is introduced and set up she has little to do in a story thats all about Straits Luke. Stevens Fisher and Peter Weller -- in a curious role in which he must misquote Hemingway and make it sound believable -- play their various long-maintained personae by rote making this sketch of Hollywood seem even more fake. Postcard glimpses of Los Angeles as seen through Danny Hieles jittery rack-focus lensing lend the impression the filmmakers lack understanding of a town depicted here as a glittery hell-hole. Strait and Simpson who holds her own as an actor share some warm moments in front of the mic though why David Baerwalds score dips into Nino Rota-like riffs is anyones guess.

With Pell James Steven Strait Ashlee Simpson. Director Meiert Avis (136). PG-13 Language sexuality drug content. 1.5 Stars. On paper the ""rising stars"" of Meiert Avis low-flying romantic comedy ""Undiscovered"" are Steven Strait and Pell James but the real star is Tyson the Skateboarding Dog. Tyson a brown and white English bulldog has his own Web site (www. skateboardingbulldog.com) which offers clips of the eager fireplug flying down the street on his skateboard. In other words you dont have to endure this dreadful movie to see him in action. But if you do get lured into the theater by photos of the movies cover-boy and cover-girl co-stars all will not be lost Tysons boarding runs near the beach in L.A. are frequently inserted and go on at length over the final credits. Meanwhile there is this dense collage of romantic cliches to slog through in a story of fated love that begins on a subway in New York and picks up in the clubs of L.A. Strait a former model and current lead singer of the rock group Tribe plays Luke Falcon a wanna-be songwriter/rocker who looks across the room where he is performing one night and sees the love of his life. Smiling back at him is a dazzling blond with the improbable name of Brier Tucket (James) a girl with whom hed exchanged meaningful eye contact in New York two years earlier. While hes struggling to get his music career off the ground shes in L.A. to make the transition from fashion modeling to acting and the movie might end right there if she hadnt sworn off musicians because one has already broken her heart. Not for a nanosecond in this achingly obvious movie do we believe she has had her heart broken or that she will long resist a romance that is in the stars. But before we get to the films final cliche Brier and Luke will put each other through a zillion of them. The plot such as it is involves Briers ill-conceived scheme to have her big-time New York agent (Carrie Fisher) manipulate the media to create a buzz around Luke. A phony item planted in the ever-gullible New York Posts Page Six gets things underway. At the same time Brier and her best friend from acting class (Ashlee Simpson singing some acting very little) hire some strippers to act as Luke groupies in the club and get another classmate to impersonate a record-company exec to stimulate interest among actual record labels. Ta-dah - stardom But at what price? Luke is no ordinary rocker satisfied with a parade of groupies. Hes in love with the girl who made him a star and who now wont date him because he is one.

"Undiscovered isnt quite ready for the big time - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Undiscovered isnt quite ready for the big time By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 26 2005 The nice dude singer-songwriter in Undiscovered"" keeps insisting that contrary to the opinions of the girls who jump him midsong hes not a rock star Im a musician "" he says. Whats impressive about this otherwise unimpressive little movie is how it doesnt force the issue. Luke Falcon (Steven Strait) has bad hair and a worse name and indeed he is not a rock star. His voice is too meek his songs too tender his outlook too humble. He doesnt appear to want to conquer the music business; he wants to hug.But for a few weeks Lukes life changes. Fame knocks although under the circumstances he should have answered only for Fame."" He was so much more likable before the record deal the Brazilian model girlfriend the online fan sites and the Porsche. Not because he becomes a jerk (hes too sensitive for that) but because hes just not terribly excited about success. Isnt that what he traded New York City for the dive lounges of Los Angeles to attain?Before I get ahead of myself Undiscovered"" is also a romance between Luke and Briar Tucket a model who has come to Los Angeles to make The Leap to acting and who is played by Pell James (these names). She and Luke actually met once briefly on the subway in New York and now theyre in LA together. Her scenemate at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute (seriously Lee Strasberg) is also Lukes buddy. (With screenwriting like this who needs Friendster?)But the movie coughs up obstacles to keep them from getting too close too soon. Briar for instance has run away from her boyfriend a Jagger-tastic rock star (Stephen Moyer) wholl sleep with anything. Hes shown in a pool where beautiful women circle him like a sharks. Howd a sweet girl like Briar wind up with such a pig? Yet shes fighting her attraction to Luke the earnest teddy bear whos a bit of drama queen too. (Newsflash"" he says to her You didnt hurt me. You killed me"")Kip Pardue as Lukes hippie brother seems to get the joke of his character but somehow its never funny. Carrie Fisher shows up as Briars agent a woman who rightly sounds as if shes seen it all. As it stands the movie is plain like a pumpkin that failed to be turned into either a carriage or a jack-o-lantern. Occasionally the moviemakers aim for cynicism about the music industry -- Fisher Stevens plays a smug Aamp;R guy in one of the worst performances Ive ever seen -- but how can we trust the movies distrust when one of its stars is Ashlee Simpson?Incidentally Simpson is pretty good playing Luke and Briars spunky pal. But her inoffensive goodness is a symptom of the movies relentless homogeneity. It doesnt belong at a megaplex. It should be playing on a Clear Channel station.

"This one should be left Undiscovered - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW This one should be left UndiscoveredAugust 26 2005|Kevin Crust | Times Staff Writer A vacuous show-biz trifle (now theres a triple redundancy for you) ""Undiscovered"" delves into the criminally neglected world of aspiring musicians and actors trying to make their mark in Hollywood. Directed by Irishman Meiert Avis a veteran of U2 music videos from John Galts script its a film in which coincidence and serendipity function as script doctors but to no avail.Singer-songwriter Luke Falcon (Steven Strait) glimpses Nebraska farm girl-slash-model Brier Tucket (Pell James) on the New York subway where she picks up his dropped glove and he tosses her its mate (an apparently romantic gesture) but shes gone before he finds out so much as her name. He declares himself ""smitten"" to his brother Euan (Kip Pardue) but unfortunately is headed at that very moment to try his luck in L.A. and figures he will never see the lovely blond again.But this is a movie after all so in a New York minute Brier is informing her fairy god-agent Carrie (Carrie Fisher) that shes ankling the Apple for the Coast to try her hand at acting. In a class at the Strasberg Institute Brier meets Clea (Ashlee Simpson star of pop music and reality television) who leads her to Luke whos become a regular at the Mint but its really complicated because Brier is like sort of dating this philandering British rock star (Stephen Moyer) and really doesnt want to get involved with another musician. For The Record Los Angeles Times Wednesday August 31 2005 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches; 32 words Type of Material Correction Radio DJ -- A review of the movie ""Undiscovered"" in Fridays Calendar section referred to DJ Ryan Seacrest as being on radio station KYSR-FM (98.7). Seacrest moved to KIIS-FM (102.7) last year.Though Luke is described as Jeff Buckley meets Elvis Costello and we see him making an aborted in-studio appearance on KCRW his music is strictly the kind of goopy sensitive guy stuff played by Ryan Seacrest on Star. Equally artificial the L.A. of the movie is the neon-lighted hipster (their word not mine) hangout ripped from glossy magazine spreads and ""Access Hollywood."" HBOs ""Entourage"" feels like a gritty documentary by comparison.By the time Peter Weller turns up as a mythic record label exec to cleanse everyone with his philosopher-guru mantras and save everyone from sleazy Aamp;R man Garrett Schweck (an enthusiastic Fisher Stevens) the film has more or less euthanized itself and the audience will be wishing for the same. When the sight of a skateboarding bulldog is the most entertaining thing on the screen you know youre in trouble.At one time called ""Wannabe"" -- which would have been far too self-aware -- ""Undiscovered"" is the kind of elliptical romance in which any scenes of substance (say where the lovebirds get to know one another or have an actual conversation) have been omitted to clear space for the music video montages. In fact the whole movie could be clipped by about 95 minutes and it would make a swell little video for Simpsons performance of the title cut from the soundtrack.UndiscoveredMPAA rating PG-13 for sexual material including dialogue partial nudity language and drug contentTimes guidelines Man wearing thong.

"Undiscovered Unmemorable washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Undiscovered Unmemorable Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 26 2005 Tailored for the readership of Teen People magazine and about as thought-provoking as the average 500-word celebrity profile ""Undiscovered"" follows the romantic and career-based ups and downs of a group of pretty yet pretty vacant Los Angeles model-musician-actor hyphenates. When cute-as-a-bunny model-turned-actress Brier (Pell James) meets singer-songwriter Luke (Steven Strait) a hunk poised on the verge of becoming a pop-music heartthrob shes involved in a doomed relationship with a caddish rock star (Stephen Moyer). So while Brier and Lukes relationship languishes in the ""friend zone"" the only tension the film is able to muster comes not from the question of whether but when these two crazy kids will wake up and realize theyre meant for each other. I have news for you This particular epiphany comes right on schedule about 90 minutes after the lights go out. And I dont think Im spoiling anything for anybody except those who have never been to a romantic movie in their lives. Meanwhile Lukes career takes off then does a nose dive represented by the infamous Downward Spiral Montage of heavy drinking and repossessed cars. Somewhere in there Luke realizes that Brier played a part in his discovery leading to Lukes anger at not being able to -- cliche alert -- make it on his own terms. But rest easy my children. All will be well and Ashlee Simpson who plays Briers best friend Clea will get to sing -- or at least lip-sync -- several more songs than she managed on ""Saturday Night Live."" Undiscovered (PG-13 92 minutes) -- Contains some obscenity a drug reference post-coital canoodling a catfight and scantily clad booty-shaking. Area theaters.
