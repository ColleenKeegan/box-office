Despite nice touches pic meanders in the middle and ends flatly auguring a box-office score that looks like a long shot to cover Universals bet. Hoping to cash in on the conjoined passion for sports and gambling ""Two for the Money"" is a parlay that doesnt quite pay off. Al Pacino delivers moments in his showy textured portrayal of a big-time ""sports adviser"" but there are too many nagging echoes of roles past -- a little ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" here a touch of ""The Devils Advocate"" there maybe just a flutter of ""Scent of a Woman."" Despite nice touches pic meanders in the middle and ends flatly auguring a box-office score that looks like a long shot to cover Universals bet. Although inspired by a true story the production notes concede that the foundation was ""expanded deepened and embellished"" which comes as no surprise given this ""Wall Street""-like tale of a young man dazzled by corrupting wealth before the inevitable skid. As Brandon Lang a former college quarterback whose NFL dreams are sidelined by a career-ending knee injury Matthew McConaughey looks ripped all right and more than a little hungry. Trapped in a text-messaging job he stumbles onto football handicapping catching the eye of Walter (Pacino) who whisks him off to New York. Walters business is perfectly legal peddling advice to high-rolling bettors then claiming a percentage of their winnings to keep the intoxicating flow of information coming. Sports gambling is a 200 billion a year industry the fast-talking Walter notes explaining that they are ""selling certainty in an uncertain world."" At first Brandon has the Midas touch and in a none-too-subtle twist forms an almost-paternal bond with Walter his own dad having abandoned him as a kid. The money and new haircut and tailored suits roll in as do ties to an enormously wealthy gambler (Armand Assante) who could potentially catapult their enterprise to a new level. The freshest wrinkle in Dan Gilroys script is that Walter is no amoral Gordon Gekko but a more complicated creature. He loves his doting wife (Rene Russo) and young daughter while struggling with his own litany of addictions -- which provide the basis for his lengthy rapid-fire speech at an ""anonymous"" group meeting one of the films strongest scenes. As the action plods on though the ambivalence toward Walter muddies the movies direction lurching pic somewhat awkwardly into a last quarter that briefly builds suspense then just as quickly deflates it -- along with any rooting interest in the outcome. On the plus side Pacino is in his element here variously self-destructive raging lapsing into chest-grabbing fits cajoling and charming -- sometimes all at the same time. McConaughey generally holds his own as the steely yet vulnerable protege but beyond that central pairing the cast barely registers. Russos character is thinly drawn and Jeremy Pivens highly caffeinated turn as one of the handicappers bears a striking resemblance to his ""Entourage"" alter ego Ari Gold. Director D.J. Caruso (""Taking Lives"") also dawdles a bit too long working up to the fall inasmuch as theres limited drama in watching Brandon win repeatedly. Possible side plots regarding Brandons family and a beautiful woman he picks up in a restaurant meanwhile receive such perfunctory treatment that any substance appears to have been sheared away. In light of the sensitivity surrounding sports gambling the NFL wasnt about to be caught dead anywhere near this production and has even prevented Universal from running ads during games. As a consequence there are vague references to ""Super XXXX"" (a playoff game not an over-sized beer) and funky team uniforms in the fleeting football sequences that resemble the collegiate Division II ranks. Several football announcers do lend their voices to the festivities along with radio personality Jim Rome. Given the title and subject matter ""Two for the Money"" invites all manner of sports metaphors but one should suffice -- that of a top-notch star and accomplished role players who are talented enough to exhibit flashes of brilliance but are restricted in the final analysis by an unimaginative offense.

Here Pacino plays Walter Abrams a New York sports-betting magnate (his firm offers advice to gamblers for cash) who thrives off the cut-and-thrust of his business while struggling to keep at bay his own addictive leanings and an increasing threat of heart failure (he wheezes and clutches his chest a lot). A bubbling paternal instinct (a strange theme this one entirely unexplained) drives him to hire and nurture young Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) an injured American footballer who Abrams plucks from a Vegas call-centre to become his new star employee under the alter-ego John Anthony. Together they host a weekly TV show and the money rolls in at least for a while...Two for the Money presents a wild corruption of the sporting dream thats so revered by American cinema - but does so in confused cluttered and uninspiring fashion. Clearly the hope was that the character of Walter Abrams would win through but the sub-Glengarry Glen Ross dialogue comes across as too arch and sounds like its been written especially for a Pacino-for-hire performance Youre small Jerry shouts Walter. You belong in a can. The films morality is all skewed too. How can we feel sorry for the poor sucker whose gambling habits have dragged him into poverty and for Abrams whose own greed leads him to a dark place when the dream fades?

"Two for the Money | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; two-for-the-money ) Two for the Money (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Two for the Money starts as a high voltage drama about the underbelly of the sports business - the multi-billion dollar gambling industry. The movie takes us into the warts-and-all world of 1-900 numbers and internet betting sites bringing us on-board and suck(er)ing us along with the main character. For 60 minutes Two for the Money is a great ride - compelling informative and thought-provoking. Unfortunately around the half-way point the melodrama kicks in and the films focus becomes increasingly murky. Original screenwriting gives way to clichA(c)s and the resolution while offering closure seems false - too much a case of the filmmakers wanting to have their cake and eat it too. The role of gambling honcho Walter Abrams is tailor-made for Al Pacino. Its great fun watching Pacino tear into this role knowingly and calculatingly overacting. By delivering all the expected rants and mini-explosions Pacino creates in Walter a character who is not only larger-than-life but intense and charismatic. Pacino understands what the part demands and delivers it with gusto. This is not great acting in the conventional sense but when Pacino is on screen its impossible to ignore him and he is one of the few saving graces of the woeful final hour. When everything is crashing and burning around him Pacino turns up the heat. Throughout his career Matthew McConaughey has taken vicious jabs for his pretty-boy looks and lightweight acting choices. The looks are still in evidence here (in fact since the actor has opportunities to show off his buff body one could argue they are more obvious here than at any time in the past) but theres talent to go along with it. This may not be McConaugheys best career role but its up there. Aside from Pacino and McConaughey the acting leaves few impressions. Rene Russo is underused and that term doesnt begin to describe the lack of screen time accorded to Armand Assante Jeremy Piven and Jaime King. (All three appear to represent interesting subplots that were whittled down to almost nothing at some point in either the development or post-production process.) The story opens with a brief prologue showing how promising young quarterback Brandon Lang (McConaughey) suffers a career-ending injury before he has a chance at a career. Years later post-college Brandon is working for minimum wage by running a gambling tip service for a 1-900 operation. The accuracy of his picks captures the attention of Walter Abrams (Pacino) a New York City businessman who runs a much larger organization. He offers Brandon a big salary increase and a palatial apartment if he will re-locate and work for him. Soon Brandon has become the hottest commodity in the Big Apple with a correct prediction rate exceeding 80%. Everyone is enthralled with ""John Anthony"" (the name he has adopted) except for a jealous co-worker (Jeremy Piven) and Walters wife Toni (Rene Russo) who fears Brandon will re-awaken Walters secret demons and put too much stress on his weak heart. But when Brandons luck falters and his ability to make predictions hits a wall his life begins to unravel. Some of the early portions of Two for the Money reminded me of the first act of Martin Scorseses Casino. Both films offer frank inside views into aspects of gambling that most ordinary citizens are not privy to. The characters and tone recall those from 2000s The Boiler Room. To Walter anyone calling his betting service is already hooked. Its just a matter of how much money they can be talked into betting. (Walters business gets a 10% commission on all winnings made using a pick from his prognosticators.) Brandon becomes the rarest of the rare - John Anthony can not only predict but he can close sales as well. Hes a rising star and as Walters protA(c)gA(c) the heir apparent to the business. He eats drinks and sleeps football until Walter miscalculates and the roof caves in. The second half of the film concentrates on the Brandons fall from grace and its less interesting than his rise to power. Were left with untied loose ends (like the lack of closure associated with Armand Assantes mobster character) and most of the resolutions are clichA(c)d. Having gotten Brandon to the top its as if director D.J. Caruso and screenwriter Dan Gilroy know they want him to take a fall but cant figure out how to make the downward spiral as arresting as the upward trajectory. Its an unfortunate thing for a movie to show so much promise in its first half then disappoint to this degree as it comes down the home stretch. For Caruso this is his second consecutive outing to suffer from the same fatal flaw. His previous directorial effort Taking Lives was an engaging thriller until it took a preposterous third-act turn. Two for the Money despite being more of a drama than a thriller (although it occasionally has the rhythms of the latter) starts out as strongly and finishes as weakly. One hopes this is not a trend. Two for the Money is marginally worth seeing if youre a Pacino fan but even then waiting for the DVD is the smart bet. Two for the Money (United States 2005) Director D.J.

Two for the Money Matthew McConaughey and Al Pacino in a story of sports betting -- and losing. Universal Pictures So its only a mild surprise that what we get on screen is if not high drama at least non-comedic -- a movie for those who havent seen Oliver Stones 1987 Wall Street. This shakier variation follows the same parabolic fortunes of a hot young hopeful in a turbulent cash-cow profession corrupted and mentored at work by a suspect role model. Part of the movies problem is that the youngster (Matthew McConaughey) takes a lot longer than we do to spot cavernous chinks in Als armor. McConaughey plays a broke college football player who has to drop out of school after an injury -- and better this acting chore than trying to carry every grain of springs miserable Sahara on his back. McConaughey will never be an actor who lets you into his soul but hes credible as a good ole boy who knows how to pick winners in the flood of televised games that makes sports gambling a gazillion-dollar industry. About the movie Two for the Money   1/2 (out of four) Stars Al Pacino Matthew McConaughey Rene Russo Armand Assante Jeremy Piven Jaime King Director D.J. Caruso Distributor Universal Rating R for pervasive language a scene of sexuality and a violent act Running time 2 hours 3 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Pacino hosts a cable show thats akin to those televised half-hour rundowns that offer unsure investors financial advice. He grooms protege McConaughey to be flashier than the down-home type he is gives him a new name and touts the kids picks as an 80% sure thing for listeners. All for an 800-number phone call and a piece of any bettors winnings. The movie has a lot of built-in flash and is thus mildly entertaining though the running time grinds it down. Whats more its only novel components are a couple of side issues Pacino is a reformed gambling addict while his hair-stylist wife (Rene Russo her first film in three years) has to be his keeper and deal with her own sordid past. Other than its current ad blitz this isnt a movie garnering much buzz. Money pulls out its most histrionic stops for a somewhat over-the-top finale which deters from what fun there has been. So with Pacino not doing much beyond what he has done before its time to take our cue from Ed Murrow Good night and good luck.

Starring Al Pacino Matthew McConaughey Rene Russo Jeremy Piven and Armande Assante. Directed by D.J. Caruso. (R. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Two for the Money"" is big loud glossy and entertaining. Its a movie on the fringes of big-time sports gambling but its not a sports movie nor a gambling movie. Its a classic Faustian bargain but its not really a moral tale either. Theres a scene dominated by Al Pacino at his scenery-chewing best that gets to the real heart of Dan Gilroys script. At a Gamblers Anonymous meeting Pacino as betting service kingpin Walter Abrams tells the gamblers that they are not addicted to gambling or to money or to winning. They are addicted to losing. Because he says ""after you lose everything you stand there and say Well Im still here. Im alive. "" ""Two for the Money"" then is about addiction -- the lure of addiction the high of addiction and the honest pleasure of addiction. Many films that deal with such matters are very clear about the dangers of addiction but dont quite capture what makes addiction well so addictive. This one does. Matthew McConaughey is Brandon Lang a former college quarterback who sustained a career-ending injury and years later hasnt given up hopes of a comeback. After another rejection slip arrives in the mail he confidently says ""Well there are those two other Arena League teams and then the Canadian Football League"" The NFL of course is a dream long gone. Lang works -- at 10 bucks an hour -- for a company in Las Vegas that operates various 900 numbers. His football betting picks are 80 percent accurate and that attracts the interest of Abrams who is an ex-gambler ex-alcoholic and ex-who-knows-what-else and now runs an internationally known betting service -- he even has his own cable access show. His wife Toni (Rene Russo) is also an ex-alcoholic and her main job seems to be keeping Abrams who has a heart problem but still sneaks smokes from falling off his various wagons. Abrams grooms Lang who tells him ""Modesty is not a virtue -- could be a liability."" He rechristens Lang as John Anthony -- a super slick football prognosticator who is soon making the company millions. Until ... well you know the rest. The inevitable downfall and we learn a valuable lesson. Strange that predictability holds back a film about prognostication although Jeremy Piven as Langs rival and Armand Assante as the worlds biggest sports gambler turn in unique performances. The director is D.J. Caruso a journeyman who made the rather uninspiring thriller ""Taking Lives."" Here he successfully rides the lead actors bravado and Gilroys mostly decent script which is based on a true story. I must admit from very the early going I was reminded of ""The Devils Advocate"" and could not get that out of my head. ""Two for the Money"" can be seen as a remake with sports betting replacing the legal profession and McConaughey off the bench for Keanu Reeves; an evil-gray New York City and a deliriously over-the-top Pacino remain intact. Both movies are at their best when the protagonist is hooked. Vicariously it feels so good. -- Advisory This movie contains strong language brief nudity and mild sexual situations.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED October 5 2005 at 239 pm | UPDATED May 8 2016 at 930 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post A Gamblers Anonymous meeting is underway and Walter Abrams and the protege he rechristened John Anthony (Matthew McConaughey) sit in a circle of people. After the confession of a GA lifer Walter gets up. But its Al Pacino who takes over. The best writing in the sports-gambling flick ""Two for the Money"" (screenplay by Dan Gilroy) becomes a far far better thing on Pacinos lips. Sure Walter has those manic swings in enunciation that have marked many a Pacino character. But then Walters a salesman. And Pacino revels in his characters manipulative skills but also exposes his malformed generosity. ""Gamblings not the problem"" he tells his rapt listeners. ""Were the problem. Were lemons. Were addicted to losing. ""I never feel more alive than when theyre raking the chips away ... not raking them in."" To borrow from the overheated language of the films productions notes Pacino is as close to a sure bet as a director can find. Thats not to say every film Pacinos in is a winner. But odds are better than good the actor will deliver exquisite moments or at the very least a scene-chewing act of bravado. Thanks to Pacino but also McConaughey and Rene Russo ""Two for the Money"" directed by D.J. Caruso delivers a better than decent pay out. Of course as seductive as Walters observations are theyre a crock. After all Walter has chosen a troubling way to make a living. His company is part of the 200 billion-a-year sports betting economy. While gamblings illegal advising gamblers isnt. And Sports Advisors employs handicappers and rows of salesman to tout winners for - most often - losers. McConaughey plays Brandon Lang/John Anthony a phenomenally gifted handicapper of football games for a 900-number call center. Lang is to this tale of over-the-top mentorship what Charlie Sheen was in ""Wall Street."" Only McConaugheys jus folks drawl and palpable decency make Lang far more sympathetic. A star athlete from childhood Brandon was quarterbacking a college bowl game when he made a dash for the end zone. As Chris Berman says when its a foregone conclusion He could go all the way. Only Langs run ends with his leg bent at an ungodly angle. If he were John Elway this would remain a sports story. But ""inspired by a true story"" of a writer Gilroy met it isnt about the purity of the game. Its about the muck that surrounds it and feeds off of it. Walter recruits Brandon when no team will. He also gives him a new identity a sleeker profile. For a brief shining moment Sports Advisors rides ""Million Dollar Man"" John Anthonys winning streak. As the movie cranks up the soundtrack and Lang sloughs off more of his identity to don the pricey accessories of John Anthony the film risks becoming too enamored with its characters gray market ethics to offer us new let alone redeeming insights. Thats where a losing streak and Russo comes in. Gilroy wrote the part of Walters wife Toni for his own mate Russo. Her presence is hardly nepotism. As she has in past films (""Tin Cup"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") Russo steps in when a guys movie requires a grown-up gal to make it better. Walter relies on Toni to detect BS. And ""Two for the Money"" leans smartly on Russo as the grounding wire between its sparking leads. The film rides on the believable chemistry of its trio. If it doesnt go all the way it certainly sprints toward a climax that feels like a gripping 2-minute drill.  | ""Two for the Money"" R for pervasive language a scene of sexuality and a violent act|2 hours 2 minutes|SPORTS DRAMA|Directed by D.J.

"Into the Blue has unexpected depths - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Into the Blue has unexpected depths By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 30 2005 Regarding Paul Walker and Jessica Alba How do you get a decent performance from a wood plank and a helium balloon? Amazingly John Stockwell knows Just add water.Stockwells Into the Blue"" is the most improbable of movies a comic thriller set in the Bahamas in which Walker and Alba bare enough flesh to seduce us into thinking theyve bared pieces of their souls.They play a couple who gets paid to tool around in the ocean. Hes Jared a diving instructor; shes Sam a woman who handles the sharks at a local resort. And after their greasy buddy Bryce (Scott Caan) arrives with the salty gold digger (Ashley Scott) he picked up hours before Jared and Sam get tangled up with the local drug lord who wants the bricks of powder removed from a plane that crashed into the ocean. Do the divers risk their lives to keep a profitable brick or two? Do they walk away as the upright Sam suggests?This all sounds typical and with any young Hollywood hack Matt Johnsons script would have felt that way too 80 rushed minutes of drug pirates guns and booty. But somebody at the movie studio has let Stockwell and his two editors take their time. Into the Blue"" is as much a mesmerizing aquatic expedition as it is a reasonably suspenseful action adventure. The movie contains as many suggestive shots of stingrays tropical fish and hungry sharks as it does of Alba or Scott in their bikinis. And Walker is a revelation gliding like a torpedo from one scene to the next. I realize HBOs Entourage"" meant its Aquaman"" movie as a gag but Walker coolly suggests that it doesnt have to be.Stockwell lets the Bahamian locations and the North Atlantic Ocean call out to you. The camera zooms down a waterslide and there are numerous shots of the cast submerged in Caribbean waters blue enough to suggest a dip in Elijah Woods eyes. All the snorkeling scuba diving breath holding and emergency mouth-to-mouth is sexy. Yet this isnt the standard travel brochure or a Coppertone ad either. Jared and Sam arent tourists at least not anymore. The black locals treat them like members of the community. And the movie catches enough regional color to suggest a bustling awareness that the island is bigger and busier than two American lovebirds. (A buddy of Jareds complains My baby mama harass me for a new weave"")Stockwell even proves himself amphibious taking us on one electric trip to a nightclub where we meet another tremendous specimen Tyson Beckford as a neighborhood bigwig and every bit the land shark with a fat Mohawk serving as his dorsal fin. The story thickens later with a dirty hairier but no less alluring Josh Brolin throwing villainous shade.If were to care about the curves in the plot we have to believe that Jared and Sam are truly in love. To this end Stockwell just as he did with Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez in the amazing Crazy/Beautiful"" furnishes us with make-out sessions between Walker and Alba where the kisses are deep and physical not the ghastly locking of gears we usually get between two actors. Sams disappointment with Jareds vanishing scruples feels real. So does his eventual shame at having let her down.What makes Walker and Alba so pleasurable to watch here -- and it takes a decently made movie to reveal this -- is that neither appears to be a narcissist. They comes alive as the movie deepens. Casting them among showboats like Caan Brolin Beckford and Scott is shrewd By comparison Walker and Alba seem like innocent rather compelling eye candy. And in John Stockwell theyve finally found their Willy Wonka. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Hedging Its Bets Two For the Money Loses Big washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Hedging Its Bets Two For the Money Loses Big Walter Abrams (Al Pacino) runs a high-stakes betting firm in ""Two for the Money"" also starring Matthew McConaughey. (By Erike Schroter) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday October 7 2005 Al Pacino has played the mentor so many times he ought to get a kingmakers award. In ""Donnie Brasco"" he ushered undercover agent Johnny Depp into the mob. He handpicked agent-trainee Colin Farrell to root out a CIA mole in ""The Recruit."" And in ""The Devils Advocate"" he was a lawyer Lucifer luring Keanu Reeves into the Hades of the courtroom. So in ""Two for the Money"" when you see Pacino playing betting-firm capo Walter Abrams and leading ex-football player Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) into the greedy underworld of high-stakes sports gambling well you know to expect certain things. Dark princely things that is. Walter introduces Brandon to his factory of speed-dial score gurus and expounds loquaciously about this hidden world of ecstatic highs and suicidal lows where fortunes are won or lost over the quirky bounce of the pigskin on ""Monday Night Football."" Unfortunately ""Two for the Money"" directed by D.J. Caruso hedges on its lurid promise. Sure it takes us to the dark side but it does so with such a fat dose of equivocation the fight between good and evil feels fixed in favor of Hollywood redemption. Let Brandon wander to the edge of vice but give him such a strong moral center his souls never in danger. Walter who acts like hes going to serve up some delicious treachery never seems more than a morally dodgy softie who rents elephants for his daughters birthday and loves his wife Toni (Rene Russo) dearly.

Caruso; Author Dan Gilroy; Release Date Wide 10/07/2005; Distributor Universal Posted October 5 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT In Two for the Money the latest of Al Pacinos dark-suited-dad-figure-who-cant-stop-shouting extravaganzas Matthew McConaughey plays a sports betting consultant so wholesome he has to be taught how to say the word f--. I never bought it but that doesnt mean I didnt enjoy listening to Pacino wrap his joyful singsong rasp around some good old for-f--s-sake obscenity. By now no one of sane mind would go to a Loud Voice Al movie -- a genre unto itself -- expecting art. You go to watch Pacino entertain himself with his hyperbolic cheeseball mastery. This time hes a goateed guru of football odds a TV host who reels in suckers with a 1-900 number that allows them to get betting tips from his team of ace consultants. McConaughey as a star quarterback retired by injury is Pacinos hot new ace of aces He knows so much about the players coaches and hidden fine points of the game that he can predict as if by crystal ball the winner of virtually every pigskin contest. Sports betting is a great subject for a movie but Two for the Money is short on the number-crunching nitty-gritty. Its a series of semi-lame ""arcs"" -- McConaugheys go-nowhere rivalry with a fellow consultant (Jeremy Piven having fun in an underwritten role) his sudden inexplicable cold streak the fact that Pacino is cast as a recovering gambling addict who ""hates himself"" deep down. I didnt buy that one either. At a Loud Voice Al movie the self-love should be deafening.
