Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 09 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday May 08 2014 537PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Andrew and Jon Erwin Written by Jon Erwin and Andrea Gyertson Nasfell Starring Sarah Drew Sean Astin and Patricia Heaton Classification PG Country USA Language English In the downtown Toronto neighbourhood where I live it is mainly the wealthy who can forgo a second income and keep one parent at home with children while the other works on Bay Street or straightens teeth. Things dont seem that different in the privileged American suburb where Moms Night Out is set Allyson (Sarah Drew) is an unsuccessful mommy blogger and harried stay-at-home mother of three; her husband Sean (Sean Astin) is a high-flying architect. But theres something a bit weird about their set-up. If Sean is an architect why are they living in a cookie-cutter house? If Allyson is such a germaphobe and perfectionist - she describes her late-night cleaning and fears of salmonella in a voiceover replete with cutesy graphics - why is her house in chaos and why are her children running wild? Surely these two have the financial and professional resources to come up with a simple mechanism to stop their youngest from repeatedly plunging his head in toilets. A lock for example.Oh but this is a movie and the screenwriters need a premise however tortured and emotionally implausible for the comedy that will ensue when Allyson and her friends plan a girls night out. She is accompanied by her mother-confessor Sondra (Patricia Heaton) a gracious pastors wife who is struggling with a rebellious teenaged daughter and her best friend Izzy (Logan White) mother of twins and wife to a man who is inexplicably terrified of small children. Meanwhile the bumbling men are left to look after the kids.What ensues - a spiralling descent into chaotic improbability that begins with mix-ups over a restaurant reservation and winds up in a jail cell - is frenetic and never as funny as it should be because directing brothers Andrew and Jon Erwin are not skilled enough at pacing the action and varying the volume.There are some amusing cameos throughout - Kevin Downes quietly shines as Seans immature video-gaming best friend Kevin; Anjelah Johnson-Reyes delights as a snotty restaurant hostess. But Drews crucial performance is lacking. Allyson wonders why when she has everything she wants she isnt happy. Her unattractively hyper character often seems whiny and Drew is not a strong enough comedian to achieve the classic screwball that would let an audience laugh at her mishaps.Mainly you have to wonder why Allyson doesnt just hire a nanny find a job and get out of the house. Ah but this is a Christian movie and once it stops pelting an audience with comic incident it begins preaching. Through the crazy night Allyson comes to see that she should just relax and enjoy motherhood. ""I am right where I need to be and God has given me everything I need to be a mom"" she concludes after a little sermon from a heavily tattooed biker who tells her Jesus loves her as she is.In other words Allyson will be just fine if she sticks to her conventional role.You dont expect rom-coms to question heterosexual pair-bonding or action movies to denounce violence but still this is a pretty limited social palette that the Erwins are painting with despite a few patronizing nods to single-motherhood. What is actually offensive (and unrealistic) is how men are portrayed as inevitably incompetent when it comes to caring for young children. To be fair there is some softening at the end of the film as Allyson recognizes that the man-child Kevin does know how to babysit but overall the gender roles in this film are set in cement.In the epilogue Sean tells Allyson that her job is important reminding her that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. Of course the work of stay-at-home moms is important (and often undervalued) as is the parenting of the many women and men who carry a double burden because they cannot afford to keep a parent at home. You can raise comedy from these choices but there is not much point moralizing about them They are largely a function of economics.

Credit Saeed Adyani/TriStar Pictures Seldom has wackiness been as tedious as it is in ""Moms Night Out"" a Christian-themed film that is desperate to make adherents seem wild and crazy but mostly makes them seem incapable of raising children.Allyson (Sarah Drew of ""Greys Anatomy"") is a young mother who appears in the grand scheme of things to have a pretty easy life but is thrown into hysterics by garden-variety mishaps. The character frankly is an insult to the millions of women who have much more to deal with single mothers who manage parenthood and a career for instance or those with seriously ill children and little money. Her husband (Sean Astin) is that odious Hollywood caricature the father who is terrified by the prospect of minding his own children for a few hours.Anyway Allyson decides that an evening out at a nice restaurant with her gal pals will cure all her discontent and all -- forgive me -- hell breaks loose with a hospital and a jail among the places the various participants end up. The film directed by Jon and Andrew Erwin (who are brothers) is way too eager to emphasize that Christians do all the with-it things. They blog They text They drive recklesslyLittle of it is funny or genuine and the benefits and beauty of real faith are nowhere in evidence. Only Trace Adkins a country singer who really should do more acting seems comfortable.""Moms Night Out"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) presumably for cartoonish mayhem.

Photo Credit Sony Affirm and Provident Films / Saeed Adyani advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT For three mothers a kid-free night out goes disastrously wrong. Rated PG (mild thematic elements and some action) BOTTOM LINE Pudding-bland humor wretched acting and a lack of basic filmmaking skills make this faith-based comedy worthy of damnation. CAST Sarah Drew Patricia Heaton Andrea Logan White LENGTH 138 Its rare that a movie fails on absolutely every level but ""Moms Night Out"" is a remarkably vivid example. This faith-based family comedy is so thoroughly unskilled unimaginative and unintentionally grotesque that its a kind of negative miracle. ""Moms Night Out"" seems intended as an antidote to working-mother comedies like ""I Dont Know How She Does It."" It takes place in an unnamed overwhelmingly Caucasian town where only lower-income single moms like Bridget (Abbie Cobb) stoop to wait tables. The movies real heroine is Ally (Sarah Drew ""Greys Anatomy"") a stay-at-home mom so overwhelmed by her homemaking chores that she barely has time to blog. After sobbing alone in a closet Ally convinces her husband Sean (Sean Astin) to watch the kids while she joins her sullen friend Izzy (Andrea Logan White) and the pastors wife Sondra (Patricia Heaton ""The Middle"") for a Saturday night on the town. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Things dont go as planned -- or rather they follow the precise plans of every ""wild night"" comedy youve ever seen. You might expect an occasional chuckle but the directors of ""Moms Night Out"" Jon and Andrew Erwin (billed as The Erwin Brothers) never deliver it. Like the average ""American Idol"" contestant they have studied what talented people do but have no understanding of how or why they do it. The Erwins believe that comedy requires screaming grimacing and flailing but theres no purpose to all the noise. The actors often seem totally disconnected from their scenes. One hint of light in the darkness is country singer Trace Adkins as a good-hearted biker named Bones. Adkins has appeared in only a handful of movies (he played a similar role in 2011s ""The Lincoln Lawyer"") but even his humble skills cast an Everest-sized shadow across this wretched production. In relative terms he deserves a standing ovation.

C- Moms Night Out Genre Comedy; Starring Sean Astin Sarah Drew Patricia Heaton; Release Date Wide 05/09/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 98; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor TriStar Pictures Posted May 14 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Somewhere between a Lifetime movie and a Nickelodeon sitcom exists Moms Nights Out a raunch-free romp made to be suffered through by the whole family. What this PG comedy lacks in cursing it also comes up short on plot character development originality and overall pleasure. Sarah Drew plays Allyson a young mother tightly wound to preposterous degree who lacking inspiration for her mommy blog plans a dinner with her best friend (Andrea Logan White) and the local pastors wife (Patricia Heaton who also produced). But oh arent we in for a treat because when moms go out and dads are left to watch the kids zany things happen Your enjoyment of Moms Night Out hinges entirely on whether you find humor in such wacky occurrences as screwing up a dinner reservation (oh no) or visiting a tattoo parlor (the drama). The low-impact plot relies on fleeting turns from folks including Sean Astin and Trace Adkins who exist only to deliver the films arbitrary religious sermon. Its a shame that this glossy production doesnt seem to realize its actually promoting an altogether different message when moms dare to leave the house everything goes wrong. C?

"Review Moms Night Out a one-dimensional bore - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Moms Night Out a one-dimensional bore Moms Night Out Handout A scene from ""Moms Night Out."" A scene from ""Moms Night Out."" (Handout) Gary Goldstein Moms Night Out should have stayed in ""Moms Night Out"" is a hectic mess that does just the opposite of what it clearly set out to do It makes motherhood seem like one of the most ill-conceived ideas since New Coke.This would-be comedy directed by brothers Andrew Erwin and Jon Erwin doesnt do the institution of fatherhood -- or marriage for that matter -- any favors either. It takes a grueling half-hour for the films three suburban moms -- wildly neurotic blogger Allyson (Sarah Drew) best friend Izzy (Andrea Logan White) and pastors wife Sondra (Patricia Heaton who executive produced with actor-husband David Hunt) -- to hit the road for a much-needed night on the town.But following a failed attempt at fine dining and some consolation bowling the trio ends up on a nutty interminable search for Allys sister-in-laws (Abbie Cobb) missing baby. So much for the gals fun -- and ours. Tattoo parlors police stations a plucky British cab driver (Hunt) fisticuffs car chases and a motorcycle gang factor into the womens ridiculous pursuit to stultifying effect. Meanwhile Allysons workaholic husband (Sean Astin) his man-child bachelor bud (Kevin Downes also a producer) and Izzys inanely phobic spouse (Robert Amaya) do nutty irresponsible stuff while baby sitting the smaller kids. It all strains to dovetail with the womens mayhem. Movie reviews for the weekendRead more stories While the characters are mostly one-dimensional and the children here merely props whiny and overwhelmed main mom Allyson proves a particularly galling unfunny creation.The film has a faith-based quotient with ample spiritual references including a nice climactic speech by a kindly biker (well played by Trace Adkins) to satisfy devout viewers. But overall messaging here thanks to the hapless script by Andrea Nasfell and Jon Erwin evokes the Doris Day era far more than the Twitter age.------------""Moms Night Out.""MPAA rating PG for mild thematic elements and action.Running time 1 hour 37 minutes.Playing In general release.

The gently religious message might have come across better if the film had been even remotely subtle.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersAllyson (Sarah Drew) is a frantic stay-at-home mom who has it all but doesnt seem to appreciate any of it. Instead shes a weepy complaining clean freak who even whines about her favorite glittery high heels. They used to make her legs look so good she complains but now she rarely has a chance to wear them. Its tough to feel for Allyson and her glamorous First World problems.When her children prepare her breakfast on Mothers Day she overlooks their exuberant sweetness. All she can see is the possibility of salmonella.Best known for her part on Greys Anatomy Drew does little to humanize a harried character that comes off more annoying than relatable.Her husband Sean (Sean Astin) suggests his stressed-out wife take time for herself.What follows is unadulterated idiocy.Allyson plans a Saturday night out with pals Izzy (Andrea Logan White) and Sondra (Patricia Heaton). Initially intending to have dinner in an upscale restaurant the night becomes a madcap and nightmarish escapade for the maternal trio featuring trips to a scuzzy tattoo parlor and the local jail with a poorly filmed car chase shoehorned in between.The story feels cobbled together from other movies. Its view of harried moms and hapless dads is stereotypical and simplistic. Pets go AWOL cars disappear and children require emergency medical treatment. And this is just the dads doing.Some plot points dont jibe with the overall theme and characters actions often dont make sense. Sondra sports a tattoo of Donny Osmond but went to a Woodstock reunion? How does this even line up?So much of the story is cliched and derivative. An early scene of the moms walking in slow motion a la Reservoir Dogs is ridiculously played out.Worse the tone is jarring careening between raucous physical gags and potential tragedy as if theyre equal on the zany shenanigans scale.The whereabouts of a baby belonging to Alysons sister-in-law Bridget (Abbie Cobb) are unclear. Hes not with her ex-husband Joey (Harry Shum Jr.) and not in the tattoo parlor where Joey left him. Why would a religious-themed film play a missing baby for laughs?Alyson ultimately realizes raising kids is an important job and that God loves her. Somehow she didnt know this before.""Jesus will always love you just for being you"" a wise biker named Bones (Trace Adkins) tells her.Lovely sentiments but Jesus might prefer that Allyson work on being less of a pouty whiner.Celebrating motherhood with a sloppy humorless story and a facile sermon pays dubious tribute to this essential role. 294 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 44 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1jljk5P",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/08/moms-night-out-review/8314359/,200,moms'nightout8,moms'nightout,usatoday

This week ""Moms Night Out joins the list. Caption A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics. One star Sid (John Leguizamo) meets a female sloth (Jessie J) in ""Ice Age Collision Course."" Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday May 8 2014 Follow AnnHornaday A few minutes into ""Moms Night Out"" its aim becomes clear to be a wholesome earnest alternative to such crude sisterhood comedies as ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Other Woman"" as well as an antic portrait of modern families to rival well ""Modern Family."" But this strained clunkily orchestrated and dismally retrograde film -- produced by one of its stars Patricia Heaton -- serves only to remind viewers why its metaphorical arms are too short to box with those predecessors. The story of a harried stay-at-home mother named Allyson (Sarah Drew) ""Moms Night Out"" trafficks in the most patronizing images of women either as addled neurotic control freaks or haplessly dizzy dames. The running gag about Heatons character -- an otherwise earthy and wise pastors wife -- is that she just cant figure out texting on that newfangled contraption called a mobile phone. (Andrea Logan White plays Izzy who has little to do except provide a foil for Allysons hysterical outbursts.) The men in this shaggy-dog story of a Saturday night gone awry dont fare much better Sean Astin as Allysons husband plays a guy whos on the road most of the week and spends his weekend evenings playing video games with his best bud (who hates kids). The controlling image of domestic life in this putatively pro-family polemic is that women are doing it wrong -- by putting too much pressure on themselves not to do it wrong -- and that if they dare to ask their spouses to be equal partners thats sure to end in disaster as well. Directed by Andrew and Jon Erwin from a script by Andrea Gyertson Nasfell and Jon Erwin ""Moms Night Out"" possesses the production values and awkward pacing of a lame amateur production with big ambitions. The films finest performance might belong to country singer Trace Adkins who as a tattooed biker lends a pastoral ear to Allyson in her time of need and comes up with some forgiving advice about being yourself and letting God take care of the rest. Those are perfectly valid sentiments of course but couched within a frantically busy patently false narrative they sound condescendingly preachy -- not helped by the fact that Allyson herself comes across as a one-note caricature of self-pity and entitlement. Early scenes of her supposed ""crazy"" life -- raising three bratty children in a spacious house in the suburbs miserable because she has no time to work on her mommy blog -- strike a particularly forced fake-breathless note. In 1963 Betty Friedan called such craziness ""the problem that has no name."" Theres no doubt that the problem still exists but in this case its name is ""Moms Night Out.""  PG. At area theaters. Contains some thematic elements and mild action. 98 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Directors Jon Erwin Andrew Erwin (138). PG. Empire 25. Dont be fooled by the title or the ""Hangover""-style trailer. ""Moms Night Out"" is really all about moms staying home where according to this movie they apparently belong. The movie lectures ""The hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world."" Granted most moms have two hands. But in this deeply conservative comedy theyd better not use one to knock back a beer -- even if they could probably use it. Allyson (Sarah Drew of ""Greys Anatomy"") a high-strung mom of three definitely needs to let off steam somehow. After witnessing her latest meltdown her husband (Sean Astin) insists she take a fun night out. Shes hesitant at first but then remembers ""Im listening to my husband. Its Biblical."" So off she dutifully goes with a friend (Logan White) and their pastors wife (an amusing Patricia Heaton). Things go wrong immediately which in this movie means they lose their dinner reservations and have to go bowling instead. Additional chaos is created by their baby-sitting husbands -- because were repeatedly reminded men are overgrown adolescents who are either mystified or terrified by children. Theres nothing inherently wrong with faith-based entertainment. The problem comes when as with any heavily slanted perspective the faith takes precedence over the entertainment. From left Andrea Logan White Sarah Drew Patricia Heaton and Sammi Hanratty in Moms Night Out (TRISTAR PICTURES) Why make a one-wild-night adventure if youre afraid to get wild? Here the mild action is simply a means to the end. Allyson learns strict lessons about a mothers place in the world. Eventually she finds happiness by reconnecting with her family and realizing that ""I am right where God needs me to be. I am His masterpiece."" Those who spend good money watching her come to this conclusion may not feel the same.

"Moms Night Out a family values comedy that falls flat review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMoms Night Out a family values comedy that falls flat reviewTimed for Mothers Day and billed as a family friendly gal-pal comedy Moms Night Out sort-of echoes the plot of The Hangover with the sex booze and cursing removed.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. May 8 2014Moms Night OutStarring Sarah Drew Patricia Heaton Logan White and Trace Adkins. Directed by Jon Erwin and Andrew Erwin. 99 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGMoms Night Out sashays into theatres just in time for Mothers Day on a bit of a covert mission.Its billed as a family friendly gal-pal comedy -- one that sort of echoes the plot of The Hangover but with a clear memory of the night in question and the sex booze and swears traded for G-rated mayhem and mom-positive feel-good hijinks.Article Continued BelowBut about 10 minutes in as frazzled young mother of three Allyson (Greys Anatomy Sarah Drew) screeches her car to a halt to wrangle her rambunctious trio into church the truth comes out. This is a ""Christian comedy"" and any mommies out there who may find solace for real-life parenting challenges in a bottle of chardonnay dont have a prayer.From left Izzy (Andrea Logan White) Allyson (Sarah Drew) and Sondra (Patricia Heaton) strut their stuff in Moms Night Out.  (Saeed Adyani)  Not that theres anything wrong with that. And certainly Sony Pictures which has made 65 million (and climbing) with Heaven is for Real sees an audience to be served. Perky Allyson is often frantic and occasionally adorable. She has a bad case of the maternal blues and small wonder. A stay-at-home mom whose husband (Sean Astin) is often on the road leaving her to cope shes a frustrated wannabe mommy blogger who blames her inability to write a sentence on the fact she hasnt had a night out with the gal in two years. Two years? Allysons self-doubt about her parenting skills coupled with mania about the life-changing potential of a night out lead to rallying her two besties for dinner at an upscale restaurant. Its OK she has a coupon.They fret over leaving the kids in the care of their doltish husbands who they fear are lacking in both parenting skills and common sense. Have they never gotten out of the house before? Apparently not. A joke about the The Shawshank Redemption is made about the kids. Wrong targets.Allyson puts on heels and a modestly sexy little black dress and slides behind the wheel of her minivan with the mommy vanity plates. Shes joined by Izzy (Logan White) whose husband (Robert Amaya) is actually afraid of their children and Sondra (Everybody Loves Raymonds Patricia Heaton also among the movies producers) a ministers wife who is juggling demands of the church with a boundary-pushing teen daughter. The busy sitcom-style plot involving a missing baby bowling a biker (country star Trace Adkins) and a chase in a yellow cab helmed by a mouthy Brit (Heatons husband David Hunt) would try the patience of a saint.Meanwhile the babysitting men come across as morons next to these heroic-yet-insecure Scripture-quoting women who never fail to remind each other that mommying is job one.Too-long one-joke scenes with a flakey restaurant hostess (Anjelah Johnson) and a dim-witted clerk in a tattoo parlour (Manwell Reyes) are typical of the sins of lengthy excess committed by Moms Night Out.A little winding-in from directing brothers Jon Erwin and Andrew Erwin would be welcome. But considering their previous film was the 2011 anti-abortion drama October Baby dealing in subtlety cant be expected.The wholly unrealistic portrayal of modern mothers fathers and even kids in Moms Night Out leaves the impression that the filmmakers like their female leads really do need to get out more.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Share Tweet Though you wouldnt guess it from the title which seems to promise wild escapades and potential ribaldry Moms Night Out is another ""faith-based"" movie specifically designed for Christian audiences in search of more wholesome entertainment. Unlike such recent examples as Gods Not Dead and Heaven Is For Real this lightweight comedy doesnt aggressively foreground its message. Apart from a couple of brief understated scenes--one character tells another about how faith has sustained her; a biker incongruously says ""I doubt the good Lord made a mistake givin your kiddos the mom he did""--religion isnt openly mentioned and the film never seems hectoring or preachy. Unfortunately it never seems funny either coming across like a sanitized remake of some raunchier laughfest.The setup actually shows a faint glimmer of promise establishing harried mom Allyson (Greys Anatomys Sarah Drew) as the sort of chronic worrywart who finds her kids making her breakfast and sees nothing but salmonella. In desperate need of some time to herself Allyson sets up a girls night with best friend Izzy (Logan White) and older mentor Sondra (Patricia Heaton) which predictably goes haywire right from the outset when the snooty hostess (Anjelah Johnson) at a ritzy restaurant cant find their reservation. Whereas a secular comedy with this premise would surely involve sexual overtures and impromptu stripping Moms Night Out derives all of its lame would-be gags from parenting as the three protagonists go in search of the misplaced infant of Allysons sister-in-law (Abbie Cobb) as their stereotypically inept husbands (one played by Sean Astin) make a concurrent mess of things while babysitting.Theres a certain amusing cognitive dissonance in seeing the general form of an R-rated comedy applied to material that barely nudges its way into PG territory. The jokes are just as broad and obvious When a cop pulls a stun gun on the women theres no doubt that someones about to be accidentally zapped and a pet parakeet is marked for death from the moment its introduced. But the sense of transgression that usually drives a movie like this is completely absent replaced by frantic... responsibility. Drew gives Allyson an appealingly manic quality that might have worked well in a less carefully neutered context but she ultimately cant do much with a character who gets into trouble by doing the mature thing in every circumstance and whose phony crisis of conscience involves not feeling as if her life is perfect even though it superficially is. Moms Night Out is neither as sententious as one might fear nor as crass as one might hope. Mostly its just bland.

Photo TriStar Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Moms Night Out Running time 98 minutes. Rated PG (mildly suggestive dialogue). At the Empire others. Consistently stale but not altogether unpleasant ""Moms Night Out focuses on the attempts of clean-freak homemaker Allyson (Sarah Drew) to spend a night out with her gal pals whom she knows from church (Logan White and a hunched-over pursed-lipped Patricia Heaton). The first half of this mommy-comedy could be charitably deemed ""gently amusing."" But its hard to find new laugh riots in kids trashing a house and theres no evidence anyone tried. Late in the movie country star Trace Adkins appears; no one should ask him to play Hamlet but hes a genial presence. The second half devolves into a bog-standard Hollywood climax. And as both the mommies and the mugging become more frantic directors Andrew and Jon Erwin ratchet up the Biblical content. Which should naturally lead to a payoff and (spoiler warning) here it is Jesus loves you. Which is nice to know even for us heathens but as Mothers Day presents go a spa certificate is easier to cash in.

This Mothers Day weekend release is pretty much a PG-rated The Hangover but with an ill-fitting God angle that slowly wedges its way into the movie -- an agenda that in retrospect explains the conspicuous lack of booze drugs and sex. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - With three kids and a husband on the road stay-at-home mom Allyson (Sarah Drew) is suffering from what can rightly be categorized as a Glamorous Female Crisis. (This occurs whenever were told a character is teetering on the edge of sanity yet we only ever see her with salon-coiffed hair a toned bod and not a circle to darken her under-eye.) So she lays it down for spouse Sean as in ""Sean Astin"" who here is riding on the residual charm of Samwise Gamgee lest he seem deplorable as this schlubby husband who criticizes his way hotter wife for eating a bag of chocolate.Allyson and her fellow moms are going out for a nice evening alone -- dont worry theres not an Emma Bovary in the bunch. Their already vanilla night is quickly interrupted when their maternal instincts lead them on a circular chase to help rescue a friends toddler from unsavory babysitters. Meanwhile Sean and the other dads are predictably fumbling with their own kids because well theyre men and child-rearing is womens work and we shouldnt play God and so on and so forth.Film Details Moms Night Out RatingPG GenreComedy Running Time98 More Info Trailer Rampant sexism aside its curious how the movie addresses the symptoms but never the cause of Allysons unhappiness. She sincerely believes that if she gets to wear her gemstone-encrusted going-out heels for just one night then everything will be OK but even these small indulgences wrack her and the other mothers with guilt. In the end a guardian angel stand-in draws our protago-mom back to the light with some choice Bible quotes but not before the only single working mother in the group gets severely jilted and returns to her man. In a big reunion scene Sean tells Allyson that her ""job"" is the most important job. Its less a compliment than a passive-aggressive plea she never take another night for herself. If she did the movie insists all hell would break loose.

Theres nothing wrong with ""Moms Night Out"" that couldnt be fixed by a massive rewrite preferably one that involves a lobotomy for the main character. Capturing the chaos that ensues when three overworked mothers decide to take a breather this dismally unfunny comedy features barely a single instance of what most adults would recognize as human behavior -- a curious failure for a movie aiming to resonate with all the frazzled mothers and fathers in the audience. Basically a shrill feature-length sitcom for the faith-based family-values crowd if nowhere near as good as that sounds Sony/TriStars Mothers Day-timed release could get some mileage out of its high-profile Christian backers (namely co-star Patricia Heaton) but wont exactly follow in the blessed B.O. footsteps of ""Heaven Is for Real"" and ""Gods Not Dead."" With her husband Sean (Sean Astin) frequently away on business Allyson (Sarah Drew) a very high-strung churchgoing mother of three cant remember the last time she experienced a moments peace and quiet. After a particularly taxing Mothers Day full of the kids usual shenanigans (coloring on the walls attempting an ill-advised cooking experiment getting toilet seats stuck to their heads etc.) Ally decides she needs a break from all the craziness and invites two other harried moms -- her not-so-bright friend Izzy (Andrea Logan White) and pastors wife Sondra (Heaton) -- to join her for a rare Saturday evening on the town. In the scripts highly reductive view of the sexes neither Sean nor Izzys husband (Robert Amaya) can handle the kids for more than five minutes and before long the night has gone foolishly ridiculously haywire. While the dads run around chasing wayward pet birds and attending to random medical emergencies the moms find themselves first turned away from their chosen restaurant by a bitchy hostess (Anjelah Johnson who was much funnier as rude fast-food employee Bon Qui Qui on ""Mad TV"") then forced to help out another mom in distress Allys sister-in-law (Abbie Cobb) who learns that her ex-boyfriend (Harry Shum Jr. ""Glee"") has left their toddler son at a tattoo parlor. Various idiotic hijinks ensue involving a British-accented cab driver (David Hunt Heatons husband and fellow exec producer) and a motorcycle-gang leader named Bones (Trace Adkins) plus a lengthy car chase and even a brief stint in jail for our much-hassled heroines. Sibling filmmakers Andrew and Jonathan Erwin who previously collaborated on the 2011 anti-abortion melodrama ""October Baby"" are clearly not overly concerned with subtlety. Amid all the parental psychodrama and strained slapstick -- set to a relentless droning soundtrack that veers from Ingrid Michaelson to ""Gangnam Style"" -- the directors working from a screenplay by Jonathan Erwin and Andrea Nasfell squeeze in a few comforting homiletic nuggets about the hard-won joys and rewards of child rearing. These come mostly courtesy of the sensible smart-talking Sondra not exactly a stretch for Heaton (""The Middle"" ""Everybody Loves Raymond"") although Bones turns out to be quite the biker theologian ""I doubt the Good Lord made a mistake giving your kids the mama he did"" he intones solemnly cueing Ally to suddenly find herself on the brink of tears. It might have been a nice moment except that Ally finds herself on said teary brink with alarming frequency in ""Moms Night Out."" Drew is an appealing actress best known for her work on ""Greys Anatomy"" a series in which she once came face-to-face with a hospital shooter and narrowly escaped with her life; the Erwin brothers appear to have watched that scene and directed the actress to sustain that same pitch of life-and-death hysteria for 98 minutes reacting to even the mildest setback with a full-blown panic attack and inflating every nervous twitch and gasp of horror into some sort of freakshow parody of manic-depressive motherhood. Its an insufferable performance and as hectic and overbearing as full-time parenting can be its the rare mom indeed who will see much of herself in this hyper-exaggerated caricature. As the characters doing their utmost to coax Ally off the ledge at any minute Heaton and Astin come off best in a cast of faces largely familiar from TV. The film was shot in Birmingham Ala. though apart from a few Southern accents and token black characters the low-budget production has little in the way of local atmosphere.

Hmmm...aside from ""professional"" critics like yourself every consumer-driven review I have read has been positive. Something must be resonating with all those people. And if you think there arent women who can relate to Sarah Drews character you are wrong. Her character was perhaps most genuine of all to me...because I had been there. The salmonella thing; the crying frequently...raising children is hard (and noble and worthy and wonderful too I might add). Sometimes you have to move heaven and earth just to get 5 minutes alone so yes we stay-at-home homeschooling moms do get a bit emotional when something threatens to wreck our plans. And most of the time we do wonder if were doing a terrible job even when we KNOW were doing the best thing for our kids. Moms Night Out is funny heartwarming and RELATABLE. And yes its sometimes ridiculous. But it wouldnt be a comedy otherwise. Reply Liz says May 20 2014 at 1158 pm Just saw this movie with two fellow moms and reading this review certainly reflects how out of touch the reviewer is with family life for many people. ""this dismally unfunny comedy features barely a single instance of what most adults would recognize as human behavior"" and ""as hectic and overbearing as full-time parenting can be its the rare mom indeed who will see much of herself in this hyper-exaggerated caricature."" There were so many echoes of agreement in the theater throughout the movie from the viewers....they must have all been ""not most adults"" or simply ""rare moms"" I suppose. Reply Dan Roden says May 20 2014 at 215 pm Real quick 87% of normal people from all walks of life liked and recommend this movie. Only 14% of so called ""movie critics"" and worse yet only 7% of so called ""top movie critics"". Shows how out of touch you all are. It seems the more one moves up the movie critic ranking to become a ""top"" movie critic the more out of touch one becomes. The only other explanation is just the good ole intolerant anti-tradition or anti-Christian bigotry. Reply Susie says May 17 2014 at 1032 pm Moms Night Out is full of things weve all said/wanted to say done/wanted to do. At every turn its your Mom your sister your girlfriend your kid your husband. This movie magnifies all the silliness of life in a way that makes it purposeful. Reply Amy says May 17 2014 at 154 pm Great movie I loved it. Went with a group of ladies and had a blast. It is great to have a movie that is funny and not vulgar. Reply S.G.momof4 says May 9 2014 at 1011 pm Its hilarious. Its my life. Sorry if it bores you. When Patricia Heaton explains to her teenaged daughter that she doesnt want her to make the same mistakes she did... Spot. on. I see caring men producing this I do not see a caring one reviewing this. Reply ron says May 9 2014 at 944 pm This is one of the stupidest reviews ever written. Get a life (and a sense of humor). Reply A Mom That Will Pass says May 8 2014 at 1055 am So let me get this straight. A male wrote the screen play (albeit a female is given second billing). Two males directed the film. From looking at IMDB it appears most of the crew was male with females filling more ""traditional"" roles as makeup artist etc. The lead character is a stay at home Mom. I think all of the above are telling of how the decision makers on this project view women. As a female why would I want to go see this? Males - why would you want to go see this film? It appears you all are portrayed as needing to be ""begged"" to care for the children and when you do take care of the kids things go terribly wrong. Im sure it will do moderately well thanks to the ""church marketing"" scheme. It seems more Hallmark movie of the week or Lifetime material. Definitely not big screen. Give me a movie written by women and with women in leadership roles in the project and then I want to see it. I refuse to spend money on an overly preachy interpretation of how males view my role as a mother female or place in society. Directors - you might be married you might have kids you may have even consulted your wives on the story but you dont know our story. Reply mom in bham says May 21 2014 at 418 am I actually have met those brothers and their wives. They are married with kids and at least one of their wives is a stay at home mom. They are very caring and understanding husbands. I get the wanting a totally woman run production but dont lash out about people you dont know. Reply Michael Foust says May 5 2014 at 800 pm I have seen a screener of the film and thought the movie was hilarious moving and a wonderful celebration of moms. Honestly one of the best films Ive ever seen. I wrote my own review ""3 reasons moms night out is the funniest movie youve never seen"" here http//michaelfoust.com/2014/05/04/3-reasons-moms-night-out-is-the-funniest-movie-youve-never-seen/ Reply Mom of Four says May 3 2014 at 649 am Sounds stressful not entertaining Is it in the movie theater or how did the other commenters see the movie? Reply Just another Mom says May 2 2014 at 524 pm This movie is awesome AND very funny As a mom of two I could relate to a lot of the scenes...I cant wait to take a group of ladies (and their husbands) to see this movie I havent laughed so hard in a LONG time and the best thing about it is its something I wouldnt mind my kids seeing...you totally got this review ALL wrong Reply joy says May 2 2014 at 934 am As a mother of 4 ... I cant wait to see it. The key here the one I think you may not be able to ever grasp is that us harried mothers need a laugh and a movie that celebrates what we do each and every day while the laughs might be trite and overdone is right up our ally.
