Comments Run Fatboy Run If youre coming to this British comedy as a fan of carrot-topped Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz Shaun of the Dead) be advised that his collaborators this time arent writer-director Edgar Wright and roly-poly sidekick Nick Frost but American TV vets David Schwimmer (who directed) and Michael Ian Black (who shares script credit with the star). Five years after ditching Thandie Newton at the altar a chubby Pegg finds her with overachieving fitness buff Hank Azaria and contrives to win her back by completing the London marathon. This feeble premise limits the movie to perfunctory gags about the heros sloth and some canned underdog drama. Dylan Moran has a few funny moments as Peggs shiftless pal and Mike Leigh regular Ruth Sheen puts in an all-too-brief appearance. PG-13 100 min. By J.R.

Amiable consistently amusing and surprisingly affecting it has the flavor of a Nick Hornby novel with its focus on an overgrown boy struggling to grow up and be a man. This funny though predictable film is improved and enlivened by its quirky British ensemble cast headed by Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead Hot Fuzz) who also co-wrote the script along with Michael Ian Black (TVs Stella). Pegg plays Dennis a slightly paunchy neer-do-well who was lucky enough to have hooked up with the beautiful Libby (Thandie Newton) only to leave her at the altar while she was pregnant with their child. He didnt think he was good enough for her and he was quite simply scared of the responsibility. Its hard to imagine rooting for this guy but thanks to Peggs likable persona you cant resist. Dennis regrets his decision daily and five years later convinced she is his one true love he decides to win her back. The only problem is she has moved on -- to a slick and wealthy American named Whit (Hank Azaria whose talents are wasted in a rather witless straight-man role). In addition to wanting Libby back Dennis hates the idea that another man will win over the heart of his beloved 5-year-old son Jake (Matthew Fenton). Known for running away from commitment Dennis decides to prove he is not a loser and can follow through on something. Spurred on by a sense of competition with the smarmy and athletic Whit Dennis undertakes to run a marathon -- the same one Whit is competing in. He is assisted by his well-meaning landlord (Harish Patel) and his feckless gambler of a best friend Gordon (Shaun of the Deads Dylan Moran). Moran has some of the films funniest moments. Director David Schwimmer (Friends) proves he possesses filmmaking finesse having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera. A romantic comedy fused with an inspirational sports movie Run Fat Boy Run is bolstered by its distinctive sense of humor alternately broad and edgy which makes both tired formulas seem refreshing. Catch up with Fat Boy and indulge in some belly laughs. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

The exchange between two paunchy pals (""Im not fat Im just unfit"" one insists) may seem to be the existential heart of Run Fat Boy Run.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 28 2008 Run Fat Boy Run (out of 4)Starring Simon Pegg Thandie Newton and Hank Azaria. Directed by David Schwimmer. At major theatres. PG ""He runs marathons.""""Why?""The above exchange between two paunchy pals (""Im not fat Im just unfit"" one insists) may seem to be the existential heart of Run Fat Boy Run a movie that finds humour in 42.2 km of exertion. Why indeed do people do this?But reluctant runner Dennis (Simon Pegg of Shaun of the Dead) isnt into self-reflection or deep thoughts of any kind. A security guard for a London lingerie store hes a life-long loser who doesnt earn enough to make rent on his dingy basement flat.He opts to enter his towns Nike River Run Marathon (the real London Marathon was unavailable) not for reasons physical or philosophical but rather to make up for some sprinting five years earlier. Dennis had been all set to marry his pregnant girlfriend Libby (Thandie Newton). But as zero hour approached he took a powder leaving Libby to fend for herself as a single mom. She didnt buy his excuse that ""spoiling your day was better than ruining your life.""Libby regrouped had a lovely son named Jake (Matthew Festoon) and has taken up serious canoodling with American money man Whit (Hank Azaria) who just happens to be a fitness nut along with being a great potential stepfather. Whit has also entered the marathon but hes serious about going the distance.Dennis is just serious about wanting to show Libby that he can actually finish something he started even though he has only three weeks to go from couch to start line.Run Fat Boy Run is the directorial debut of ex-Friends actor David Schwimmer who is much better behind the camera than in front of it. Here hes taken material best suited to sketch comedy and turned it into a feature of no small heart and humour.He benefits from a script co-written by Pegg (with U.S. comic actor Michael Ian Black) that hits all the expected slapstick notes about swollen blisters (a particularly disgusting one) and ludicrous attempts at crash training. Peggs comedic gifts are given a real workout as he gains audience support for a character that might otherwise prompt feelings of scorn or pity.Irish comic Dylan Moran the guy asking ""Why?"" in the quote up top might be considered the movies pace bunny. He steals many scenes as Gordon best friend to Dennis and also his erstwhile trainer. Run Fat Boy Run is most certainly not a movie youd watch for tips on marathon training. As a romantic comedy though it does more than just get a finishers medal.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Simon Pegg Thandie Newton Hank Azaria and Dylan Moran. Directed by David Schwimmer. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Simon Pegg isnt fat but - as fans of ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"" can attest - he is funny. That makes you forget that Pegg doesnt measure up to the description of the title character he plays in ""Run Fatboy Run."" As Dennis one of those lost souls approaching middle age without yet growing up Pegg is put to the supreme test for a comedian He has to scratch his private parts in public and make it humorous. Dennis is working as a security guard at a ladies boutique when the urge overcomes him. He puts one leg around a mannequin like a dog at a fire hydrant - to the horror of shoppers looking in the store window. ""Run Fatboy Run"" is filled with moments like this that will make you smile - if not quite induce a belly laugh. Set in London the movie shows off city landmarks like the Millennium Bridge and St. Pauls Cathedral during a marathon race from which the title derives. This is a romantic comedy light on romance but heavy on comedy and its well cast to skew in that direction. Dylan Moran another actor with funny bones plays Dennis best buddy Gordon. In one sight gag hes pictured waving from a window. The camera journeys downward to reveal his naked butt. Its probably not surprising that for his first effort as a film director David Schwimmer would choose a story about - well - friends. Dennis remains friends with his ex-girlfriend Libby (Thandie Newton) even though he deserted her at the altar five years earlier when she was seriously pregnant. Problems arise when Libby makes a new friend Whit (Hank Azaria) an American working in London who wants to marry her and be pals with her son with Dennis. Whit even acts warmly toward Dennis who doesnt trust him for a minute. Azaria postures a lot portraying Whit as too sure of himself and too slick. Rich beyond Dennis comprehension he tries to win over the youngster with front-row theater tickets. All these scenes are a set-up for the marathon. An experienced runner Whit is competing in it. Dennis gets it in his mind that he can impress Libby and maybe even win her back by running as well - never mind that hes out of shape and terminally lazy. Building up to the marathon Dennis gets in shape with the help of Gordon and Whit who humors him along. All this male bonding shuts out Newton. Libby has been given an occupation - she owns a corner bakery and apparently does most of the baking herself - but not much else in terms of backstory. Newton is given little to do except look beautiful which is easy as pie for her. ""Run Fatboy Run"" mostly skates until the actual marathon. Schwimmer is good at capturing the excitement and claustrophobia of so many sweaty bodies crammed together. The sight of Dennis in a T-shirt with ""national erectile dysfunction awareness"" on it is worth a giggle. (Every marathoner is running for a cause and this is the only one he could get at late notice.) A script by Michael Ian Black and Pegg provides some trippy surprises en route to the finish line. Pegg was brought in to make the film which originally was to be shot in this country more British. But with a little help from his friends he proves humor crosses oceans and borders. -- AdvisoryMild sexual content.

Run Fat Boy Run (PG-13) Picturehouse (95 min.) Directed by David Schwimmer. With Simon Pegg Thandie Newton Hank Azaria. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO STARS What do women want? According to comics -- male comics anyway -- its a fellow who can make jokes. Crack wise and youll have anybody falling for you -- even if you look like Seth Rogen. Or Jack Black. Or Woody Allen. Its become an annoying cliche if not an outright sexist one. Sure humor is sexy but why only in men? (Just try naming a movie in which a funny plain girl who wasnt Barbra Streisand got the gorgeous guy.) Oh and sorry to bruise their egos but in real life dont successful comics realize that if theyre getting more romantic attention now its because theyre more successful now? Not because they suddenly got funnier? No matter. ""Run Fat Boy Run"" starts with that punchlines-are-everything premise and then compounds it. Rabbitty Simon Pegg hasnt only gotten Thandie Newton to fall for him hes gotten her to say yes to marrying him. And then when shes standing at the altar -- pregnant -- he runs only to spend the rest of the movie trying to win her back. Only in the movies would someone like Simon Pegg not only win someone like Thandie Newton but then have a shot of winning her back. For reasons too dull to relate Pegg decides his best chance is to run a marathon. As the title would indicate hes not in the best of shape. But with the help of his obese Indian landlord and a dopey chum who tends to forget his trousers (a direct steal from ""Notting Hill"") he starts training for a race to win back his love and prove to himself he can finish something. Want to guess how it ends? Its all easy to figure out -- except perhaps why actor David Schwimmer decided to make this his feature directing debut. Maybe as one of those schlumpy comics always cast against model-perfect beauties he identified with the character. Maybe he thought the English locale would be a change of pace (even if the product-placement pimps have everyone swilling quite improbably Michelob Ultra). But Pegg the hard-working comic behind the zombie farce ""Shaun of the Dead"" and the cop spoof ""Hot Fuzz"" is less successful when stripped of genre parody hes required to create an actual character; theres nothing here thats very convincing -- particularly his explanation that he only gave Newton ""a bad day"" at the altar so he wouldnt risk disappointing her with a terrible life. Other breach-of-promise grooms are encouraged to try that excuse -- then duck. Hank Azaria has a little more luck with Newtons new boyfriend (a filthy-rich Yank of course) and Irish comic Dylan Moran does what he can with Peggs pantsless friend. Thats not much considering that most of the movies laughs revolve around things like blisters and jock itch and the last third of the movie is an inspirational can-he-do-it? sports flick. Its all a little wearying particularly as it was only last week that we had ""The Hammer"" -- another movie starring a schlumpy comic whose girlfriend is clearly too good for him and who decides to prove himself by engaging in improbable athletic feats. Enough already. I mean I dont have anything against comedies about dopey guys who win the love of a good woman by competing in ridiculous Olympian contests. But if I wanted to see a really funny one Id rent a ""Rocky"" movie. Rating note The film contains gross humor comic nudity strong language and alcohol abuse.

Credit Ollie Upton/Picturehouse The beleaguered man-boy Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) is always running running running an activity befitting the hero of the British comedy titled ""Run Fat Boy Run."" In the films prologue he runs away from his pregnant fiancee Libby (Thandie Newton charming in a largely reactive role) minutes before their scheduled wedding. When we catch up with him years later hes a chubby security guard sprinting after a shoplifter. Soon after Dennis decides to enter the same marathon as Libbys rich American boyfriend Whit to show Libby and his now elementary-school-age son Jake that he can make plans and see them through. ""You cant even finish a sentence"" Libby says.""Fat Boy"" will never be mistaken for art. Its ""Rocky"" by way of ""Theres Something About Mary"" an inspirational fantasy with guys-guy banter and gross-out humor (including a blister-popping scene that seems to be this films answer to the hair gel bit in ""Mary""). Yet its effective and affecting; much of its impact comes from its images of Dennis running and its conviction that theres a difference between running toward something and running away.Mr. Pegg -- the star and co-writer of ""Shaun of the Dead"" ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Fat Boy"" which is derived from a script by Michael Ian Black that was originally set in America -- never shies away from Denniss pathetic essence. Even when training for a marathon he cant seem to stop smoking and eating junk food. But Mr. Pegg also gives us enough of a sense of Denniss capacity for self-transformation that his mission seems both plausible and inspiring.Mr. Pegg is abetted by a strong supporting cast that includes Hank Azaria as the laid-back yet ferociously competitive Whit; Matthew Fenton as the sweet but never-cloying Jake; and Dylan Moran as Denniss best friend Gordon a degenerate gambler with a penchant for slightly cryptic declarations. (In the aftermath of the blister scene Gordon states ""That was the second most disgusting thing Ive ever had in my eye."")The films mix of droll banter lowbrow slapstick and melancholy song montages suggests that its director the former ""Friends"" star David Schwimmer has seen ""The Graduate"" more than once. The movie is formulaic and there are times when Mr. Schwimmer and his writers overdo things (particularly in the finale which finds Whit previously a human-scaled jerk indulging in cartoon villainy). Advertisement Continue reading the main story But its assembly-line aspects are countered by touches that translate drama into metaphor like the scene in which Dennis and Whit walk with Jake each would-be daddy tugging at one of the boys hands wishbone style and an earlier scene in which Whit warns Dennis that every marathoner hits a wall -- an admonition that pays off in the marathon sequence when Dennis encounters a chillingly effective visualization of that wall.""Run Fat Boy Run"" is the kind of movie thats apt to be dismissed a goofy lark. It is that. But its also a rare comedy that believes in its own message and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running.""Run Fat Boy Run"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Profanity nudity and gross-out slapstick. RUN FAT BOY RUNOpens nationwide on Friday.

Watching a scrawny guy run doesnt provide a lot more comedic surprise than ""Run Kenyan Guy Run"" would have. Simon Pegg co-writer and star of the hilarious mockbusters ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" features in somebody elses script (though he did do a rewrite) about a London bloke who on his wedding day comes down with a case of the panics and literally sprints away from his pregnant bride - played by Thandie Newton. To win her back from her rich new beau (Hank Azaria) five years later he decides to complete a marathon showing he can dedicate himself to something or other. Writing ""Simon Pegg"" and ""Thandie Newton"" in the same sentence nearly made my keyboard explode. Shes an interplanetary beauty sent to us by a superior life form. Hes a ginger-haired mutt. What exactly is she attracted to? His job as a security guard at an underwear boutique? I cant classify the two in the same species much less the same apartment. Peggs Dennis does come across as a sweet guy though and Azaria is strong as the oblivious overdog in for instance a scene in which his financier invites Dennis to a gym for a workout then casually strips naked and powders up his man-parts as Dennis gasps either because hes out of breath or just plain amazed. Thanks to a jaunty Brit-rock score and likable characters all around the movies easy to watch and occasionally pumps up the emotions especially in the scenes in which Dennis plays with his now 5-year-old son. You root for Dennis without quite hating Azarias Whit who doesnt even see Dennis as competition. Says Whit ""Youre not a tough act to follow."" First-time director David Schwimmer keeps things simple (possibly too simple) finds comedy in the characters and saves some of his best stuff for the third act such as a scene in which the runner ""hits the wall."" Even Dennis nutty mission to prove his worth by doing something hundreds of thousands of others have done almost makes sense by the end. Everything is lightly amusing (Dennis Indian landlord fondly tells him a romantic tale about his own tragic lost love ""I remember all the humping"") but nothing is terribly funny. (One brilliant touch When Dennis is running someone hands him a pint of beer instead of water.) Schwimmer also basically forgets to put the meat in the story sandwich when instead of painstakingly presenting just how an out-of-shape guy could possibly get into marathon form in three weeks (then match the fitness-obsessed Azaria character stride for stride) he merely rushes through a Comedy Training Montage much like the three others Ive already seen this month.

Joe Neumaier Wednesday June 4 2008 354 PM Run Fatboy Run. A loser tries to win back his ex-girlfriend by entering a marathon. With Simon Pegg Thandie Newton Hank Azaria. Director David Schwimmer (137). PG-13 Rude and sexual humor nudity language. At area theaters.Theres much too much of everything in ""Run Fatboy Run"" the wanna-be zany directorial debut of ex- ""Friends"" co-star David Schwimmer. Every ounce of comedy is so forced and full-on ridiculous that when characters express even a smidgen of sentiment it feels like a parody.Thats because nothing in ""Fatboy"" feels real. Not the life-changing event that haunts its hero Dennis (Simon Pegg) or the job he has as a London security guard. Not Dennis relationship with his ex-fiancee Libby (Thandie Newton) or son (Matthew Fenton). Not his neighbors his pratfalls or proclamations of love or the new guy in Libbys life (Hank Azaria). Certainly not the rousing ending it cobbles together from other movies. Not even Peggs fake gut looks authentic. A prologue establishes that Dennis acquired that gut after running away from a pregnant Libby moments before their wedding. Five years later his life has gone nowhere fast though hes trying to have a good relationship with his kid. When Libbys too-perfect beau Whit proposes to her Dennis is moved to show how hes changed by training for a 26-mile race that will pit him against Whit as well as his own underachiever image. Working from a screenplay from Pegg and comedian Michael Ian Black ""Run Fatboy Run"" aspires to be a ""Notting Hill""/""Four Weddings and a Funeral""-type of comedy complete with a wacky pack of pals last-minute change of heart pretty London streets and a soundtrack full of English beats. But it all falls with a thud. Pegg - a normally fun presence who was a more believable everyman in the zombie farce ""Shaun of the Dead"" - mugs up a storm and bugs his eyes out like a Muppet jacked on Red Bull. Newton is lovely but sadly reduced to a surprised-reaction machine and Azaria is miscast as the dapper suitor. The one-time ""Spamalot"" star can play goofiness (""The Birdcage"") and nerdiness (a guest role as a scientist on early episodes of ""Friends""). But as a pompous Guy Smiley he rings false. Most disappointing is how Schwimmer - who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with hyperverbal characters - manages to bumble ""Fatboys"" tender moments. Too often Dennis stammers out grunting half-words to Libby as she knits her brow and smiles sweetly waiting for him to say something witty. Audiences shouldnt hold their breath either.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Five years on he still sees Libby (Thandie Newton) to pick up their son for afternoons in the park but thats about the limit of the apathetic Londoners capacity for commitment. While hes regretful for ditching her he explains ""I thought spoiling your day would be better than ruining your life."" Edging into his 40s hes sporting a middle-aged paunch working a dead-end job as a security officer in a lingerie boutique and is behind on his rent in a basement apartment that resembles a Dumpster. Tree sloths make more effort. When Libby introduces her rich accomplished and fit new American boyfriend Whit (Hank Azaria) Dennis misgivings over abandoning her boil over. Radiating Mr. Wonderful self-satisfaction Whit mentions that hes running the London Marathon in three weeks. Dennis determined to impress Libby casually announces that hell be competing too. The runaway bridegroom then embarks on a crash course in self-improvement complicated by the fact that hes winded after a one-block sprint. While the setup promises a routine romantic comedy with training pratfalls the film is better than expected. Its directed with warmth humor and intelligence by David Schwimmer who has learned a thing or two about comedy from a decade on ""Friends."" Pegg a cult hero for writing and starring in ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" once again juggles scripting and acting duties effortlessly. ""Run Fatboy Run"" is a novel romcom told from the male point of view. Peggs Dennis isnt merely an inept comic underdog -- hes a credible even poignant character who gradually wins us to his side. As in his earlier films Pegg effectively works dramatic moments and honest sentiment into the design while surrounding himself with a strong comic support network. Dylan Moran is irrepressibly droll as Dennis best buddy Gordon a sleepy-eyed slacker who lances a blister on his friends foot receives a face full of yellowish goo and remarks ""Thats the second most disgusting liquid Ive ever had in my eye."" RUN FATBOY RUN  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some rude and sexual humor nudity language and smoking. Dennis Buddha-shaped Asian landlord played by Harish Patel bikes along as he jogs encouraging him to keep up the pace with stinging slaps of a spatula. He believes in Dennis capacity for spiritual reincarnation -- given the right sort of encouragement. The beauty of the film is that we do too.

Photo Picturehouse Run Fatboy Run 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Im not fat Im just unfit objects Dennis at a key moment in Run Fatboy Run and I have to agree with him. Yes he has an undefined horizontal mass around his middle and no the sight of him in too-tight teeny-tiny exercise shorts is not recommended for more sensitive viewers. But he isnt fat. And fatness isnt shall we say the bottom line. The film is more concerned with running - fat or not Dennis is always on the fly. In the opening scene he hot-foots it from his pregnant girlfriend on their wedding day establishing right from the start that hes possibly a coward likely a fool and quite obviously prone to flop sweats. His is a face with two skin-tones pink and fuchsia. Hes a man who lives in holy terror of finishing what hes started. But because hes played Simon Pegg we can rest assured that deep down hes an OK bloke wholl prove himself before long. Pegg has both a gift for precise physical caricature and an open-faced sympathetic hamminess that make him instantly authoritative in any role whether hes battling an evil supermarket mogul (as in Hot Fuzz) or fending off zombies in a blood-soaked shirt (as in Shaun of the Dead). His wicked comic timing is always a force to behold but in Run Fatboy Run its the steam that runs the engine. This is not a film with blazingly original ideas or a groundbreaking script - I guessed the ending before the movie even started - but it has a sweet nature an abundance of laughs and plenty of Pegg to spare. Props to David Schwimmer who makes his feature directorial debut (after 10 episodes of Friends two episodes of Joey and sundry other TV projects) with this small beguiling comedy about a demoralized London security guard in a race to win back the woman he loves. Her name is Libby (Thandie Newton) and of course shes dating a muscled American prig (Hank Azaria). Of course hes wealthy and handsome and athletic and of course hes planning to run a marathon. Of course Dennis on hearing this resolves to run the same marathon despite being heinously out of shape and having a mere three weeks to train. He wants to show Libby he can finish something anything - that he isnt the feckless lout who left her preggers at the altar. Libby remains suspicious (who could blame her?) but also nurses a soft spot for Dennis who shares custody of their now-5-year-old son Jake (Matthew Fenton). Having established Dennis a prime boob and decent if clueless father Pegg and co-screenwriter Michael Ian Black (The Pleasure of Your Company) then move on to the requisite Rocky-drinks-raw-eggs-and-jogs scenes. This is where Dennis shorts enter the picture albeit barely along with an acute case of groin rash that afflicts him on the job at a womens clothing store. (``Keep your hands out of the scrotal zone whilst youre at work warns his boss.) The plot also involves a friend with a gambling habit (Dylan Moran Shaun of the Dead) and an effusive Indian landlord (Harish Patel). None if this is all that inventive but most of it made me laugh like a ninny anyway and I misted up on cue at the climax. The film swings easily from nutball Britishisms to American cliches (the underdog; the jerkwad beau; the body fluid gross-out) and its mid-Atlantic multiracial tone yields a vibe of relaxed cultural compromise. This is a nice movie about a nice guy no matter how he finishes - first last or not at all. Lets just say I rooted for him. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals PUMA at eBay for Deals from 2 + free shipping 10x30-Foot Gazebo Tent Canopy for 75 + free shipping Sinwood Indoor Electric UV Insect Zapper for 29 + free shipping Original Penguin Mens Leather Wallet for 15 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Simon Pegg is so easy to like. The ginger-haired Brit first made his presence known with the winning zom-edy ""Shaun of the Dead"" which he starred in and co-wrote. Last year he appeared with good friend Nick Frost in the buddy-flick spoof ""Hot Fuzz"" which he also co-authored. Pegg is quite good at delivering the broad gestures of comedic cluelessness and astonishment only to stumble -- intentionally -- on moments of authentic pathos.  1/2 RATING | Romantic Comedy In ""Run Fatboy Run"" a minor romantic comedy that marks the capable directorial debut of ""Friends"" David Schwimmer Pegg is Dennis an immature bloke who leaves his expectant and expecting bride at the altar only to regret his cowardice forever after. Five years after Dennis suffers his harrowing ""should-I-stay-or-should-I-go"" agonies hes a security guard at an upscale womens lingerie boutique in London. His No. 1 foe is a tranvestite who boosts undies then leads Dennis on an air- gasping foot race. Continuing her hiatus from dramas Thandie Newton of ""Crash"" and ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" but last seen in the horrid ""Norbit"" plays jilted Libby. Her casting calls into question Dennis sanity all the more. Libby owns her own bakery the cheeky name of which is one of many puns that remind audiences that the PG-13 comedy likes its naughty bits. Although Libby has moved on she encourages Dennis and son Jakes relationship. Matthew Fenton plays (not overplays) the thoughtful imp. Hes fond of his father but is favorably inclined to moms new beau. Insult to injury Whit the highly presentable suitor (Hank Azaria) is running in a marathon for charity no less. Paunchy impulsive Dennis blurts out hes to run the same race. Hence the title. Dennis is not fat. ""Hes just not fit."" He smokes. He drinks the occasional pint. He returns to the one-room flat he rents from Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel) and his fetching daugther Maya (India de Beaufort). He never has keys. How physically fiscally superior his rival is becomes clear when Dennis arrives at financier Whits office to size him up. In the locker room after an impromptu spin class Dennis finds himself ahem sore and lacking. Writers Pegg and Michael Ian Black take the easy route when they decide to make Whit a cad in order for Dennis to grow. Team Dennis consists of his best friend Gordon and Mr. Goshdashtidar. What they lack in training skills they make up for in dedication. Dylan Moran hits dead-on notes as deadpan Gordon a gambler who invests heavily in his pal. The affable Patel endears as the landlord who wields a well-meaning spatula. Will our underdog underachiever complete the marathon? Will he defeat the increasingly icky Whit for his sons and Libbys affections? ""Run Fatboy Run"" isnt going to win any prizes for fresh questions. But its just fleet enough to hold its own in the middle of the pack. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com ""Run Fatboy Run"" PG-13 for some rude and sexual humor nudity language and smoking. 1 hour 40 minutes. Directed by David Schwimmer.

"Competing plots run Fat Boy off course - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Competing plots run Fat Boy off course Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / March 28 2008 What can you say about a movie that features both the blinding loveliness of Thandie Newton and the sight of a man soaked in the contents of a giant foot blister? Stay home. ""Run Fat Boy Run"" the first movie ""Friends"" star David Schwimmer has directed seems to have been packaged at the Farrelly brothers manufacturing plant. The assembly-line work actually appears to have been outsourced to London where the movie is set.Like the brothers best comedies ""Fat Boy"" wants to bridge the difference between the unsavory and the sweet by conflating them. Like the least of their work - last years ""Heartbreak Kid"" remake comes traumatically to mind - Schwimmers movie seems all the more inept for trying in the first place.On the one hand we have the story of a runaway groom Dennis (Simon Pegg) who wants his ex-fiancee back (Newton) only after he discovers shes now dating a hedge-fund manager (Hank Azaria). (Five years ago Dennis did a hundred-yard dash away from his bride.) On the other hand theres the sports movie that breaks out once Dennis jealous and physically unfit agrees to run a marathon because the new boyfriend is doing it.The script comes from Pegg and the American comedian Michael Ian Black and they deserve credit for stuffing a cross-country picture into a romantic comedy. But the only thing twin formulas do here is double the monotony. Now we have to wait for two dead plots to resolve themselves.Pegg works hard throughout the whole thing agreeing to fall down on cue and off. Hes not bad but all the slapstick mugging and self-deprecation hes required to do made me think fondly of his directors underappreciated work on ""Friends"" where Schwimmer was physically inventive and never lazy about delivering off-kilter line readings. He should be starring in this movie instead of trying to dazzle us with gratuitous crane shots and stilted crowd sequences. As for Pegg his real talents are all almost completely verbal. His wit was put to better use in ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) and last years ""Hot Fuzz"" two surprising comedies he co-wrote that failed to get the American audiences they deserved. Those films managed to mock and embrace movie genres without ever seeming as intelligent as they were.""Run Fat Boy Run"" might as well have been written by a rushed piece of software. The program calls for a surprise engagement a street fight complete with crotch punches an apartment eviction and a runaway child - all in about five minutes. As an obstacle course this is mighty efficient. As comic storytelling its painful not too far from being socked in the crotch.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Yeah so? It may be the kind of film that will make you smile more than laugh but youll smile a lot. And although it practically forces you to root for its hero you wont mind a bit because the hero is played by Simon Pegg. As such the film fits comfortably into the slot of ""minor British romantic comedy."" Or so youd think. Although it takes place in London and was co-written by Pegg the other writer is American comic-actor Michael Ian Black and the film was directed by (drum roll please) David Schwimmer. Yes that David Schwimmer a former star on Friends which was about as American as comedy gets. (See related story here.) Yet Schwimmer has the good fortune or the good sense to let Pegg be Pegg - a wise choice because hes one of the funniest actors working today specializing in the lovable down-on-his-luck British loser. A guy like Dennis in other words. Hes the fat boy of the title. The film begins with him running away literally from his wedding leaving his pregnant girlfriend at the altar. It seems that Dennis makes a lot of his own trouble. Five years later Dennis is a security guard in a womens-underwear store struggling to get his act together in just about every respect. His former girlfriend Libby (Thandie Newton) is dating Whit (Hank Azaria) a successful American businessman. Dennis is still in love with Libby so naturally Whit drives him crazy. Whits a runner training for the London Marathon. Dennis gets it in his head that if he can run the marathon it will prove to Libby and their son Jake (Matthew Fenton) that he can accomplish something that his life does have purpose that he can set a goal and reach it. Awfully big goal though. Dennis is out of shape he smokes he can barely walk up a flight of stairs. He embarks on a rather unorthodox training schedule spurred on by his landlord Mr. Ghoshdashtidar (Harish Patel) and his friend Gordon (Dylan Moran) who has a vested interest in seeing Dennis finish the race. Can he? The race itself is when the movie truly takes off into whimsical fantasyland. Its not that what happens couldnt happen. Its just that . . . well any more would spoil it. And its not as if Run Fatboy Run is a documentary about distance running. This much is certain You will find yourself firmly in Dennis camp; the film allows for no other response. That in fact is one of its shortcomings. Youd think a movie about marathons wouldnt take shortcuts but toward the end of the film Whit goes from a smug-but-decent-enough sort to an out-and-out heel. Its as if the movie doesnt trust us to make up own minds about whom to root for. Which is never a question of course. Pegg is the rare actor who can take a character that dumps his girlfriend at the altar and still make him sympathetic. No matter what trouble he gets himself into no matter how much the fault is his hes so charming (albeit it in a scruffy way) that you practically will him to succeed. The same goes for Run Fatboy Run. It has its flaws but its likable enough that you cant help cheering for it anyway. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Hes got what it takes but hes saddled himself with a script (co-written by Pegg and Michael Ian Black) that Adam Sandler wouldnt have pulled out of his bottom drawer. After dumping Thandie Newton at the altar (were supposed to have sympathy for this guy?) Pegg tries to beat her beau (Hank Azaria) in a London marathon. Director David Schwimmer bloats this slapdash concept into dim witless overkill. D Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Not one of the former members of that overrated sitcom has managed to knock the planet off its axis (although Jennifer Aniston did marry Brad Pitt for about 10 minutes guaranteeing her a few roles in bad movies). Now David Schwimmer has extended his earning potential to include directing. Run Fat Boy Run his feature debut behind the camera is the kind of genial jokey fare youd expect an ex-Friend to helm. If only he and his screenwriter Michael Ian Black a fellow American had kept their original story grounded in their own backyard the movie might be more than just another BBC travelogue but transporting it from New York to London makes it seem limp and labored. The laughs are few and forced. Its a conventional story about Dennis a nervous neurotic nerd (British comic Simon Pegg) who runs away on his wedding day leaving his pregnant bride Libby (Thandie Newton) at the altar. Five years later working as a paunchy security guard in a womens clothing store chasing down shoplifting drag queens who steal bras and pantyhose hes a real mess--out of shape and out of rent money. Hes such a loser that little children give him the middle finger on the bus. But Dennis still honors his part-time father duties with his son and he still loves Libby who has never forgiven him for deserting her in her white bridal gown. ""Women remember that stuff"" says his doped-up slacker buddy Gordon (Irish comic Dylan Moran) who seems to be acting in a completely different and much funnier movie. So Dennis validates his earlier stupidity by trying to win them back by competing against Libbys new squeeze Whit (Hank Azaria) a rich handsome American hedge-fund manager with six-pack abs in a pointless 26-mile marathon. The feeble attempts by the manic dysfunctional Dennis--hobbling through the streets of London with a beer belly and with his overweight Pakistani landlord (who looks like a Pakistani Jabba the Hutt) wielding a kitchen spatula as his ""coach""--to prove himself a more mature responsible and manly lover than his buff rival Whit are intended to provide the films humor but the notion backfires. I mean nobody in their right mind would prefer the salami-faced Simon Pegg to the suave and muscled Hank Azaria. Still director Schwimmers chief inspiration here turns out to be the casting of Mr. Pegg and Mr. Moran and the decision to let them write a lot of their own stunts. Shaped like a bowling ball scratching his scrotum on the extended hand of a wooden department-store mannequin sponsored in the marathon by National Erectile Dysfunction Awareness Mr. Pegg pretty much turns Run Fat Boy Run into a solo turn. By the time he runs the last 11 miles with a sprained ankle the movie turns into one of those beat-the-impossible-odds-in-excruciating-pain flicks and there is zero chemistry between him and the luscious Thandie Newton but it doesnt matter. The film is about male relationships anyway. Clumsy and inept in demeanor but a whirlwind of comic energy with an air of self-congratulatory winsomeness Simon Pegg steals this otherwise minor but enjoyably unpretentious little comedy and pockets it like a Mars bar.

The director David Schwimmer underlines the jokes and adds exclamation points but a softer touch probably wouldnt have helped. As Peggs rival in love Hank Azaria does an amusing George Clooney send-up (hes too handsome for the room) that has the paradoxical effect of invoking Clooneys elegance and making the movie seem even flabbier. -- David Edelstein Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick Teen Wolfs Tyler Posey Apologizes For His Fake Coming Out HBOas Divorce Is Actually a Wish Fulfillment Comedy HBOas Limited Series The Night Of Might Get a Second Season TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

When actors go behind the camera one usually spies hitherto unknown traits of artistic personality. David Schwimmers first bigscreen directing effort reveals something very different a thoroughly competent mainstream craftsman who imposes no individual character on formulaic material. Comedy starring Simon Pegg as a runaway groom trying to win back his love by running a marathon is a polished innocuous by-numbers affair in the mode of ""Wild Hogs"" or pre-""Harry Potter"" Chris Columbus. Pegg might give pic a leg up in Blighty but lack of marquee stars and Brit setting could muffle impact in North America. Pegg is credited as co-writer (with story originator Michael Ian Black) though the script was originally set in New York before London-based Material Entertainment came aboard. Despite transplant to a London setting and a mostly Brit cast the pic with its triumph-of-solo-underdog arc feels like Hollywood product -- closer to the Farrelly brothers than to Peggs home-turf collaborations with Edgar Wright (""Hot Fuzz"" ""Shaun of the Dead""). Prologue finds working-class stiff Dennis (Pegg) a nervous wreck in the moments before hes expected to wed heavily pregnant g.f. Libby (Thandie Newton). When its time he runs -- literally pursued by bride and wedding party. Five years later he lives in a basement flat works as a lingerie-store security guard and spends every waking moment aware that he blew it big-time. Libby is willing to let him spend time with their son Jake (Matthew Festoon) but she wont even acknowledge his pathetic attempts to start things over again. Slamming that door tightly shut is her serious new boyfriend Yank financial exec Whit (Hank Azaria) who is handsome rich reliable fit attentive and several other things Dennis isnt. Hes even nice as pie to Libbys ex -- which annoys our hero even more. Sick of being a loser Dennis impulsively vows to Libby that hell compete in the same 26-mile charity marathon his hyper-fit rival is running. Trouble is the event is in three weeks and as Dennis prefers to put it hes ""not fat ... just out of shape."" Nonetheless he makes at least an initial committed effort. For reasons of their own some financial and some altruistic best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran) and landlord Mr. Ghoshdashtidar (Harish Patel) sign on as his whip-cracking trainers. There are no surprises here -- just broad frequently slapstick gags that dont avoid but do tamp down a bit on the bodily-function school of yokkery. Lengthy race finale lacks the nerve to parody inspirational-sports-pic cliches instead playing it fairly straight. Pegg Newton and Azaria are all first-rate talents coasting through mediocre material. Irish comic Morans shrugged-off line deliveries score a few points. Slick pic hews to comedy conventions of the moment frequently driven by a soundtrack featuring various pop artists; production package is slightly above-average for the genre with a nice warm look to Richard Greatrexs location lensing. While theres not much here to warrant critical praise Schwimmer handles everything with the kind of pro confidence that leaves little doubt hes got a second career track if he wants it.

Five years on from a wedding-day panic that saw him leaving pregnant Thandie Newton at the altar hes now working as a lowly security guard. The arrival of slick financier Hank Azaria in her life gives him cause to shape up and win her back though accepting his rivals challenge of running head-to-head in Londons latest marathon seems an unlikely route to redemption given that the superfit Yank lines up as odds-on favourite against this pot-bellied Brit.Sounds predictable? Trust me it is what with Peggs supporting team (slacker Dylan Moran and roly-poly Asian landlord Harish Patel) filling in the gaps and bonding opportunities with his son intended as emotional undertow. What should be dreadfully synthetic actually plays as a pleasant time-passer thanks to a goodly supply of one-liners and Pegg and Newtons facility for investing a string of hokey plot devices with genuine warmth. Formulaic yet disarmingly enjoyable.
