R (violence sex nudity profanity the Holocaust adult themes). Playing at the Ritz Five and Ritz Sixteen/NJ.Returning to the Netherlands for his first film since 1983s The Fourth Man Paul Verhoeven brings much of what he plied in Hollywood to a tale of Nazis Jews and the Dutch resistance. Namely the director of Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers brings over-the-top sex and action to the proceedings turning this World War II thriller into an enjoyable though wildly incredible cloak-and-dagger caper.Or in the case of the lovely Carice van Houten un-cloak and dagger. A Jewish refugee who becomes a Mata Hari for the Dutch resistance van Houtens leggy heroine infiltrates Gestapo headquarters - and a Gestapo officers bed. Using her wiles smiles and lingerie Rachel Stein alias Ellis de Vries seduces Nazi bigwig Ludwig Muentze (The Lives of Others Sebastian Koch) in order to help a band of freedom fighters.But things get complicated when (1) a mole tips off the Germans and (2) Rachel-alias-Ellis falls for Muentze and vice versa.Most everyone is fit handsome and dressed in fine period clothes. Scenes of interrogation torture and annihilation are interposed with lusty sex and breakneck chases.

"Verhoeven revisits roots in tale of Dutch resistance - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeVerhoeven revisits roots in tale of Dutch resistanceBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 04/12/2007 023311 PM PDTUpdated 04/12/2007 031329 PM PDTAmerican audiences may know director Paul Verhoeven best as a slave to excess - a lot of it wretched - from such spectacles of sex violence and questionable taste as ""Showgirls"" ""Starship Troopers"" and ""RoboCop."" The Dutchman was also behind Sharon Stones infamous leg-crossing scene in the deliriously overripe ""Basic Instinct."" In the Hollywood pantheon his is the perv oeuvre. In Verhoevens native Holland however hes better known as the director of such earnest - albeit relentlessly randy - pictures as ""Soldier of Orange"" ""Spetters"" ""Turkish Delight"" (voted the best Dutch film of the century) and ""The Fourth Man."" Depending upon how you look at him Verhoeven is both the hero and villain of his own career. Now after 20 years of horndogging around Hollywood Verhoeven has returned to his darker Dutch roots with ""Black Book"" (""Zwartboek"") a remarkable accounting of the heroes and villains fighting for and against the Dutch resistance movement during World War II. In many cases they were the same people. During the final days of the war as the Allied army marched through Europe toward an all but certain liberation of Holland the countrys Nazi occupiers relied upon a bulwark of collaborators to hold back the resistance movement. But Rachel Stein (Carice Van Houten) a beautiful Jewish cabaret singer who is trying to avoid deportation to the concentration camps as ""Black Book"" begins has no interest in either side.Advertisement Its only when her hide-out is destroyed by a stray bomb that she decides to flee. With the help of a lawyer named Smaal (Dolf de Vries) she arranges passage to Allied territory her name and all her possessions - the sum of her life - marked down in the attorneys little black book. When Rachel is reunited with her mother father and brother just before making the crossing shes hopeful that theyll never be separated again. But considering that the movie has two hours left to run its hard to share her optimism. The Germans show up but she manages a narrow escape and with help from the resistance makes her way back to the city. Bitter about what the Germans have done to her family she decides to throw in with the underground changes her name to Ellis and dyes her hair blond in order to look less Jewish. Returning to the scene of one of his earlier triumphs Verhoeven concocts another scene that revolves around a crotch shot although it must be said in fairness that this one is at least plot driven. Ellis has met Ludwig Muntze an attractive Nazi officer on a train. When her boss in the resistance realizes it is a high-ranking Gestapo officer (played by Sebastian Koch from ""The Lives of Others"") he asks Ellis to sleep with him. Now that shes a blond on top Verhoevens gyno-cam records her effort to make sure that as the English so delicately put it the collars and cuffs match. When she tries to describe Muntze to Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman) one of her comrades in the resistance he tells her the Nazi she is about to go to bed with has murdered many of her countrymen. ""He seems like a nice guy"" she says getting at the moral relativism that is the heart of ""Black Book."" Verhoeven and his longtime writing partner Gerard Soeteman have constructed a jigsaw puzzle of shifting alliances and uncertain loyalties in which very few of the characters are either all good or bad. Muntze for one isnt the usual Gestapo movie monster Hes a nice Nazi - a handsome cultured man - and Ellis falls for him. Can anyone who has risen that high in the Nazi ranks by 1944 be worthy of cinematic redemption? The movie makes it easier than you might imagine to ask that question and more difficult than you might guess to swat it away. There was plenty of murderous duplicity to go around and ""Black Book"" serves as a corrective to the unblemished heroism of the Dutch resistance in his 1977 film ""Soldier of Orange."" There is a traitor afoot in the underground but Verhoeven and Soeteman nimbly keep us guessing who it is by making everyone look a little guilty. Despite the pictures subtitles and its imposing 145-minute running time ""Black Book"" maintains a breakneck pace pausing only long enough to raise some very interesting questions. The film has been structured in such a way that we know at least one important part of the outcome at the beginning. But thats the only reassurance Verhoeven is offering this time. The fate of these people is so often in doubt its hard even to be sure of what you already know.

"Black Book War games | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBlack Book War gamesLeave it to Paul Verhoeven to find a way to insert a naked female crotch into a World War II movie - and to make it integral to the story.Rachel Ellis (Carice van Houten) finds consolation in the company of Rob a young sailor (Michael Huisman) in Paul Verhoevens thriller Black Book.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. April 27 2007Starring Carice van Houten Sebastian Koch Thom Hoffman Dolf de Vries Waldemar Kobus and Halina Reijn. Directed by Paul Verhoeven. 124 minutes. At the Cumberland Grande-Yonge and Queensway. 14ALeave it to Paul Verhoeven to find a way to insert a naked female crotch into a World War II movie - and to make it integral to the story.Its a scene in Black Book where the Dutch resistance fighter played by comely Carice van Houten dyes her body hair to match her bottle-blond tresses to disguise her Jewish features and seduce her Nazi prey.Shades of similar catnip in Basic Instinct one of the many Hollywood rousers director Verhoeven turned out after decamping his native Holland for the U.S. some 20 years ago.In returning to his homeland for Black Book and to the wartime subterfuge he first addressed with Soldier of Orange in 1977 Verhoeven hitches his fascination with history with his trademark sexual obsessions. He also employs all the production values hes learned in two decades of making blockbusters.Article Continued BelowThe unlined face and oft-admired body of actress van Houten form the canvas upon which Verhoeven stretches his wartime fiction which excites the eye even as it troubles the mind. In this make-believe world where resistance fighters have hidden agendas and Nazis are worthy of sympathy we are repeatedly instructed to believe that there are no moral absolutes.""Unhappily friends dont exist in times of war"" a character said in Soldier of Orange and that thought must have remained in the mind of screenwriter Gerard Soeteman reunited once again with Verhoeven.The corresponding line in Black Book is ""Everyone has unknown depths.""Building on this notion of moral ambiguity the densely plotted film entertains as a sort of Perils of Pauline thriller if you can stomach its troubling implications. Unlike Soldier of Orange where the resistance fighters were brave and good and the Nazis cruel and evil there are far fewer comforts in Black Book a title that refers to betrayal.A chance reunion of key characters in Israel in 1956 begin and end the movie but the main events occur in Holland in 1944 in the final years of World War II.Singing star Rachel Stein (van Houten) beautiful and headstrong is hiding from the occupying Nazis. She lives with a Dutch farm family who insist she renounce her Jewish faith for Christianity. Rachel finds consolation in the company of a young sailor (Michael Huisman) who provides momentary distraction that saves her life when a stray Allied bomb destroys her safe house.Many other men and threats remain. Members of the Dutch resistance offer Rachel safe passage across enemy lines to Allied territory. She is reunited with her family for a risky water crossing. Events brutally conspire to cut short their revelry and turn Rachel into a determined resistance fighter.Her resolve leads her into the charismatic orbit of Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman) a resistance leader on a mission to smuggle guns and correspondence to fellow freedom fighters. Rachel (now using the safer name Ellis) readily agrees to assist him posing as his lover.The gambit is foiled but even as the bullets fly Rachel rallies by seducing Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch from The Lives of Others) the dashing head of the Dutch Gestapo. He hires Rachel as his assistant and more a situation that offers intelligence opportunities but is fraught with compromise how can she aid and arouse a man who has authorized the execution of so many of her people? Worse still she may actually be falling for him.The above grossly summarizes Black Book but it is necessary to avoid revealing too much of a plot based on multiple deceptions and emotional twists - the latter including the suggestion we feel sorry for a Nazi whose family was killed by an Allied bomb.Judged in dramatic terms situational ethics drive the film never slackening the pace nor making the nearly 2 1/2-hour running time seem overlong. Van Houten is rarely out of the frame but shes no mere eye candy summoning the complications of character needed to match a seemingly endless series of crises.Director Verhoevens uncompromising vision provokes even if it leaves us questioning his assertion that there are no absolute rights or wrongs in war.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsA lesson learned from the lure of a high-yield return MayersYou can improve investment returns by shopping around but if an investment offers a rate that seems to be good to be true it probably is.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"War Is Hell and So Is Black Book washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On War Is Hell and So Is Black Book Carice van Houten in Paul Verhoevens WWII potboiler. (By Jaap Vrenegoor -- Sony Pictures Classics) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 20 2007 Possibly its no surprise that the Dutch are renowned for their dairy products as the new Dutch film ""Black Book"" manages to turn World War II into a large piece of cheese. A lurid pulpy slightly perverse potboiler ""Black Book"" suffers mainly from its utter lack of seriousness. War genocide oppression exploitation the essence of evil These are not subjects to be taken lightly and the time for melodrama is long since past. But then the filmmaker Paul Verhoeven has never been known for his judgment. After all in the American stage of his career he made two of the most notorious films of all time ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Showgirls."" He also made a near-great film -- ""Robocop"" -- and a lot of mediocrity as in ""Total Recall"" after which I concluded ""Consider dat a divorce"" Verhoeven tells us the story of Rachel Stein a Jewish cabaret singer trying to survive the Third Reich in the Netherlands of 1944. An errant bomb -- blown by the winds of war -- turns the farm where shes been hiding into a funeral pyre and Rachel is on the run. Shortly enough she reunites with her family contracts with a middleman to move themselves and other wealthy Jews through some marshes toward Allied lines and becomes the only survivor of an S.S. massacre. Indeed massacres come fast and furious in ""Black Book"" as does a plot that shunts through developments faster than a dealer can shuffle a deck of cards although nobody ever seems terribly upset about events as if the cast knows its only a movie. Two or three massacres in and Rachel takes up with a Resistance cell and is given the job of seducing the Gestapo chief. Alls fair in love and war but isnt this going a little too far in both love and war? Particularly when she really does fall in love with him. The movies morality is as dicey as its plot. It makes sure we understand that the handsome secret police colonel Muentze (Sebastian Koch) is a ""good"" German as opposed to his loutish if musically inclined henchman Guenther Franken (Waldemar Kobus who plays a mean ragtime piano in his black lightning-flashed uniform). Presumably Muentze has been sending Jews off to the camps for the whole war though the movie fails to note it; meanwhile Franken becomes villain-in-chief because the Jews hes killed include Rachels family. But thats only a tiny part of the big -- 145 minutes long -- story; most of the rest of the film examines the internecine struggles of the Resistance cell itself that is when its not contriving to get Rachel played by Carice van Houten into her sensational 40s lingerie -- or out of it. At any rate the central issue of the Resistance is rescuing the chiefs son from Gestapo captivity before he can be executed a task made yet more difficult by the fact that one of the fighters has made a kind of unholy alliance with one of the secret policemen. Well on and on it goes with hardly a dull moment but far too many lively ones (lots of machine guns) and more disturbingly quite a few repulsive ones. The massacre of surrendered Jews aboard a barge is unpleasant to watch as is a grotesque moment when Rachel in prison under mistaken circumstances is taken for a collaborator and subjected to a degradation too repulsive to be described. Verhoeven was once so promising. ""Robocop"" was smart tough funny extremely entertaining and extremely provocative. Even ""Basic Instinct"" had its moments . . . I mean other than its moment. But this whole enterprise feels like Danielle Steel on steroids not a pleasant picture. Black Book (145 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence nudity sexuality torture and degradation.

Photo Sony Pictures Classics Black Book 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Black Book stout-hearted celebration of the Dutch Resistance or total smut? Try both. From trash-master Paul Verhoeven comes this fantastically entertaining load of Nazi-era hokum a film that starts out obvious turns hammy evolves into coarse and winds up in the embrace of chest-heaving overstatement. Yet you wont be able to turn away because Black Book is one king-size guilty pleasure -- crammed with hairpin turns and Mata Hari seductions sleazebags and traitors and loose women. It has a handsome Nazi (""seems like a nice guy"") a Jewish spy and a secret microphone stashed under a portrait of Heinrich Himmler. Much blood is spilled much skin is bared. Best -- or worst -- of all it features the following brief exchange She ""Id love to see your stamp collection."" He ""But its enormous."" Such is a typical nugget of dialogue between the sultry Ellis deVries (Carice van Houten) a spy for the Dutch Resistance and Reich hottie Muntze (Sebastian Koch The Lives of Others) the Gestapo head in the Hague. Within minutes of this two-edged philatelic conversation Ellis is on her way to buck naked and Muntze is spotting brunette roots under the blonde. She must be Jewish he reasons. ""Are these Jewish?"" Ellis asks placing his hands on her breasts. So begins their torrid fling which is less the point of Verhoevens epic than the swinging excuse for many of its most enjoyable cliches. The movie consciously evokes both Greta Garbo and Mae West (is that a pistol in his bedsheet or is he just glad to see her?) along with every other over-plotted melodramatic spy puzzler ever made. Its a subtitled soap in jackboots. Too convoluted to recount the story follows Ellis from the death of her parents and brother at the hands of Nazis -- during a botched nocturnal flight from Holland -- to her subsequent rescue by the Dutch Resistance for whom she agrees to work. The plucky heroine promptly goes undercover as Muntzes secretary-cum-concubine and before long shes whooping it up with drunken Nazis in the last bacchanalian spasms of World War II. At some point the black book of the title enters the picture suggesting tangled layers of betrayal. Verhoeven a survivor of the Nazi occupation penned the script with frequent collaborator Gerard Soeteman -- who also co-wrote their 1977 take on the Dutch World War II experience Soldier of Orange. It hurries from raids to hidey-holes to postwar recrimination against Nazi collaborators and through it all our plucky protagonist remains unscathed. We know she survives because the film opens on her life in an Israeli kibbutz circa 1956. At its conclusion we return there two bromides echoing in the distance. Ellis utters both of them ""While theres life theres hope"" and ""Will it never end?"" The first quoting Cicero strikes a note of optimism thats quickly supplanted by the murky fatalism of the second. An answer arrives with the closing credits. Ellis story has it both ways -- its irrepressible and doomed the oxymoronic mindset of a heroine who cant help but endure. So goes human nature. So goes Verhoeven who once again rolls in the mud of worldly urges The grinning auteur behind Showgirls isnt above a little showing of some flesh but he isnt below the high-flown theatrics and blurred moral reasoning of wartime espionage either.

When our Jewish heroine purrs to a Nazi occupation commander ""Id love to see your stamp collection"" and he replies ""But its enormous"" mein Gott in himmel the fireworks Dont think the Zionist-Aryan sexy talk is a mistake or overinterpretation. Not when Paul Verhoeven is directing. His expensive expansive epic - 2 1/2 hours or three Dutch chocolate bars - is meant to redeem his wayward career with a rousing Resistance flair. Instead we get an R-rated ""Hogans Heroes."" Our heroines entire family gunned down while escaping on a river tug? She pouts a little then resumes diligently dyeing her pubic hair so those devilish Nazis wont figure out her ethnic er roots. When her ruse is discovered a manly Dutchman fondles her naked bosom and leers ""Are these Jewish?"" Hmmm. I dont think theres a kosher answer to that. What was ""Black Book"" supposed to be exactly? We first meet Rachel (Carice van Houten) in demure teachers garb on an Israeli kibbutz shortly after the war. Flashback to her initial Dutch hiding place in the countryside with a dour farm family. Rachel doesnt seem too worried about her missing real family taking time out to sail the nearby shores with a new boyfriend until the farmhouse is accidently bombed. Oops - time to flee. Dont forget to pack those show tunes The Perils of Rachel continue in the big city. Shes asked to befriend the local Nazis to save some captured resistance fighters and Rachel throws her brave body wholeheartedly into the task. She plans a little birthday party for der Fuhrer sings sassy songs for Colonel Klink and forces us all to endure some full-frontal Nazi male nudity. (Max Schmeling these tubby lieutenants definitely are not.) The fighting scenes are taken less seriously than your average high school drama production. Storm troopers break into the resistance meeting hall and a firefight ensues - the second its over the rebels laugh and button up their stolen uniforms. Verhoeven and his cast seem to mean well but lack the wisdom to understand the import of what theyre portraying. The plot tricks are just that - gimmicks from Hogans book. The old chloroform- over-the-mouth trick the blueprints-of-city-hall trick the hiding-the-microphone-in-the-bra trick. Its all so campy it becomes an odd form of entertainment so bad its almost good. Verhoeven who actually directed a minor Resistance classic with 1977s ""Soldier of Orange"" hasnt seemed like a serious filmmaker for some time. If ""Black Book"" was his ticket for redemption hes been shunted off to some other siding. This one comes with a laugh track. Landmarks Chez Artiste Theatre.

Happily it was well worth the wait as it pushes all sorts of envelopes--political historical and erotic--against the sanctified background of the Nazi Holocaust hitherto unthinkable as the linchpin of a lively melodrama like Black Book. This provocative film has already aroused protests in the Netherlands over its suggestion that in the revered Dutch Resistance there were traitors and opportunists who seized the chance to profit from their Jewish neighbors by betraying them to the Gestapo in order to share in their money and jewelry. Mr. Verhoeven is particularly audacious in making an enlightened Gestapo officer--played by Sebastian Koch who was cast as the idealistic playwright in The Lives of Others--as some sort of hero amid the villainies of supposed Dutch patriots. But then Mr. Verhoeven has been pushing one envelope or another throughout his career both in Holland and in Hollywood. After gaining prominence in Europe with Turkish Delight (1973) Soldier of Orange (1977) Spetters (1980) and The Fourth Man (1983) Mr. Verhoeven burst upon the American scene with big-budget blockbuster projects like Robocop (1987) Total Recall (1990) and Basic Instinct (1992) all of which did better at the box-office than with critics. Hence his first Hollywood commercial flop Showgirls (1995) left him with few defenders. Starship Troopers (1997) a futuristic sci-fi war movie pitting man against insect (with gruesome disembowelments involving both species) did little to restore his fortunes. The Hollow Man (2000) followed with a convoluted version of the Invisible Man genre to no great acclaim. Somehow Mr. Verhoeven never followed the accustomed path of foreign art-house deities with their well-manicured humanistic handprints. Instead he was more a forerunner of fun-oriented action directors like Quentin Tarantino. Mr. Verhoevens Black Book is especially startling for its extraordinarily empowered heroine Carice Van Houtens Rachel Stein/Ellis De Vries a nubile Jewish temptress out of the Old Testament who doesnt hesitate to dye her pubic hair blond to fully qualify her to enter a Gestapo chiefs bed on the orders of her Resistance superiors. She also stashes a microphone under her garter belt and plants it in a Gestapo office. This inadvertently leads to still another massacre of Jews through a fantastically complicated intrigue. At one point she escapes capture and certain death by a cinematic crowd effect reminiscent of the stirring climax of Marcel Carnes Les Enfants du Paradis (1945). I have scattered these snippets of the narrative to suggest how outrageously Rachels adventures and misadventures unfold in the course of a spectacle that would have made poor Anne Frank blush with embarrassment. Certainly Black Book is no Schindlers List with its pathetically self-congratulatory pats on the back for the tiny drops of kindness shown by its protagonist in the midst of an ocean of monstrous cruelty. The Nazis are certainly monstrous enough in Black Book but their various antagonists are far from knights in charmingly shining moral armor. Instead they are human beings which means that they were then--as they have been ever since--very fallible creatures with more than their share of scoundrels among them. The entertaining virtues of Black Book make a full-scale reappraisal of Mr. Verhoevens total career mandatory. But like so many of the more interesting films opening in New York this year Black Book is in very limited release much like Andrea Arnolds Red Road another worthy entry in this years unheralded treasure hunt. One of the interesting sidelights of Black Book is the presence in the ranks of the anti-Hitlerites of a reasonable proportion of dedicated Stalinists and devout Catholics. Soon these two groups would be at each others throats. Heaven knows what wouldve happened back then if Islamic extremists had also had a part of the action.

"Black Book may be vulgar but thats why it works - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Black Book may be vulgar but thats why it works By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 13 2007 Maybe its because the Nazis literally invaded his childhood but Paul Verhoeven sees fascism everywhere. Especially where hes not supposed to in a heroic police detective (Michael Douglas in ""Basic Instinct "") tomorrows bright young freedom fighters (""Starship Troopers "") even a rising young stripper (""Showgirls ""). He sees the power struggle in love and he sees it in democracy. Hes the Elvis Costello of filmmakers.The above titles get no respect -- to put it mildly -- but Verhoeven doesnt care. Either you come out of his movies wondering who you were rooting for (or even better why) or you recoil from the whole exercise. These are not films for delicate constitutions or for people certain they know whats good for culture history or the cinema.And so ""Black Book "" a World War II Resistance movie turned upside down and shaken until its brains rattle. The New York Times calls it ""supremely vulgar ""; I suggest thats the movies strength. Its the directors first work in his native Holland since 1983s ""The Fourth Man "" delivered him to an international audience and while Verhoeven has learned many things in 24 years how to behave isnt one of them.The heroine is a Dutch Jew named Rachel (Carice van Houten ) a singer and an opportunist whose toughness has helped her survive where friends and family members have perished. Flushed out of her hiding place in the films opening scenes Rachel eventually joins the Dutch Resistance. Renamed ""Ellis "" she goes to work as a secretarial spy in the local SS headquarters planting microphones and flirting with the storm troopers until she makes the dreadful mistake of falling for one.This is the sensitive handsome Hauptsturmfuhrer Muntze  and it helps that hes played by Sebastian Koch  that nice playwright from ""The Lives of Others. "" How much of a pussycat is Muntze? Hed rather negotiate with Resistance members than shoot them. He collects stamps.If it makes you feel better theres at least one purely evil Nazi (Waldemar Kobus as a drooling pig of an officer) and legions of jackbooted minions but the Resistance fighters on the other side dont have very clean laundry either. Its 1944 late in the war and Germany is clearly losing; the postures of heroism and valor fall away as everyone jockeys for a piece of the postwar action.The dashing doctor-turned-freedom fighter (Thom Hoffman ) a kindly Dutch cop (Peter Blok ) the helpful family lawyer (Dolf de Vries ) -- all may be more or less than they seem. Jean Renoir once said everybody has their reasons; Verhoeven by contrast says that everyone has an agenda -- a far less comforting message to hear.""Black Book"" takes the conventions of the WWII epic -- the prison breaks the interrogation scenes -- and undermines them with craft and muscle and the ripe lack of restraint weve come to expect from this director. Blood runs on the floor and rises in the characters loins; when Verhoeven wants to dump a load on his put-upon heroine he literally does so in the films most unforgivably noxious scene. In every way ""Black Book"" is the polar opposite of ""Army of Shadows "" the 1969 Jean-Pierre Melville Resistance drama that was re-released to great acclaim last year. Where Melville sanctified his doomed freedom fighters Verhoeven rubs our faces in their fallibility.All that keeps the movie from collapsing into soap opera is the exuberant drive of the filmmaking. And the central performance. Van Houten is pretty without being beautiful; in another movie Rachel would be the fast catty girl you dont trust. In ""Black Book"" shes all weve got -- war can be like that -- and we progress with her through despair nihilism manipulativeness infatuation betrayal  and the rebirth of a newly hardened sense of purpose.Does she -- or the man who created her -- believe in anything? Family . . . maybe. In the eerie calm that descends toward the end of this remarkable piece of popcorn subversion Rachel finds an ally in the one character whose only agenda has been another person. And in the framing sequences that open and close ""Black Book"" Rachel is seen at an Israeli kibbutz teaching a group of children and embracing her own.Dont think for a minute she has found peace. The year is 1956 and in the films very final frames Verhoeven lets us know that wars dont end but merely take on different names and players. If that seems unnecessarily cruel you havent been paying attention.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Starring Carice van Houten Sebastian Koch and Thom Hoffman. Directed by Paul Verhoeven. (In English and in Dutch German and Hebrew with English subtitles. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Many who volunteered for the Resistance in World War II found the experience exhilarating an adrenaline rush they would never again be able to duplicate. Numerous books plays and movies have been written about the high of these perilous wartime adventures; David Hares ""Plenty"" is just one memorable example. ""Black Book"" is the latest of the subgenre and in some ways the most unsettling because its so darn entertaining. You feel guilty enjoying this Dutch thriller so much considering the horrific events portrayed. It makes palpable the perverse thrill Resistance fighters felt putting their lives on the line every day and the accompanying freedom to do anything they pleased in the time they had left. Dont be put off by the movies almost 2 1/2-hour length -- the minutes speed by -- or overly impressed by a claim at the beginning that its inspired by true events. Enormous liberties have been taken with heroine Rachel Stein (the vibrantly sexy Dutch actress Carice van Houten) who assumes the name Ellis de Vries on undercover jobs -- that being the perfect adjective to describe sleeping with the enemy in order to get information. Described in production notes as a compilation of several underground workers Ellis who sang in cabarets before the war comes across as part Sally Bowles and part Mata Hari with a dash of James Bond. Ellis finesses as many daring escapes as 007. Shes a perfect fit for Paul Verhoeven directing a movie in his native Netherlands for the first time in two decades after a Hollywood career specializing in the violent (""Total Recall"" ""Starship Troopers"") and lurid (""Basic Instinct"" ""Showgirls""). Ellis is another of Verhoevens blond bombshells even though thats not her natural color. In a shot that has the filmmakers stamp all over it as surely as Hitchcocks de rigueur fleeting appearances she bleaches her dark hair (to make her appear German instead of Jewish) everywhere it sprouts including on her private parts. The title refers to an actual diary kept by a Dutch lawyer who spirited Jews out of Holland during the Nazi occupation. Rachel goes to him for money for her escape. When a boat carrying her and her family is ambushed by German troops shes the only one who gets away. Recognizing the young womans almost superhuman survival instinct and quick intelligence Resistance leaders recruit the newly named Ellis and pair her with their best operative Hans (Thom Hoffman) on a risky mission to transport weapons on a train. She winds up sharing a compartment with a Nazi Ludwig (Sebastian Koch the hunky playwright in ""The Lives of Others"") who -- in one of the movies many convenient if implausible twists -- turns out to be the head of the Gestapo ensconced in The Hague. Screenwriter Gerard Soeteman has collaborated with Verhoeven before and shows an intuitive understanding of the filmmakers kinky tastes. Soon Ellis is leaving Hans bed for the plusher one of her Nazi lover. Ludwig however didnt get where he is by being stupid. Spotting her dark roots he accuses her of being Jewish. Van Houten communicates with her intense eyes everything going through Ellis mind before she decides to own up to the charge and seductively defy him to do anything about it. Grabbing her breasts she teases him by asking ""Are these Jewish?"" At one of the endless parties thrown by the Nazis Ellis gamely sings to the accompaniment of a piano player she recognizes as having shot her family. Later she sneaks into this Germans office to install a hidden microphone so the underground can eavesdrop on him. Theres no end to this girls talents. Van Houten a veteran of European TV is in almost every scene and her energetic performance keeps ""Black Book"" percolating despite an overstuffed plot that strains credibility and often tips over into melodrama. Seeing the star prance around Nazi headquarters in one tight-fitting satin gown after another (one can only imagine how Ellis came by them) is a welcome diversion from trying to figure out which Resistance worker is a turncoat. Verhoeven captures the utter chaos as the Allies close in on The Hague. One of the Nazis party girls pushes her way into the arms of a Canadian soldier and is soon riding in the victory parade while another collaborator has a bucket of excrement thrown over her naked body. Some may find scenes like this excessive and take offense at the suggestion that there were good Nazis like Ludwig. But one thing that can be said for ""Black Book"" Its never boring. -- Advisory Violence and sexuality.

A Jewish singer (Carice van Houten) falls in love with a Nazi officer (Sebastian Koch) in ""Black Book."" Movie review Showtimes ""Black Book"" with Carice van Houten Sebastian Koch Thom Hoffman Halina Reijn Christian Berkel. Directed by Paul Verhoeven from a screenplay by Gerard Soeteman and Verhoeven. 145 minutes. Rated R for some strong violence graphic nudity sexuality and language. In Dutch German Hebrew and English with English subtitles where necessary. Seven Gables. ""Black Book"" is a World War II drama about a beautiful Jewish singer (Carice van Houten) who joins the Dutch resistance movement goes undercover in Nazi headquarters in order to help release captives and falls in love with a Nazi officer (Sebastian Koch) along the way. Keep in mind Its directed by the man who brought us the trashfests ""Showgirls"" and ""Basic Instinct."" But even though Dutch-born filmmaker Paul Verhoeven returning to his roots after several decades of Hollywood filmmaking seems to be quite serious about making a period drama he cant quite resist throwing in scenes of our heroine urinating (in a crowded but posh Nazi bathroom) dyeing her hair (and not just those on her head) and getting drenched by an enormous vat of excrement. That last isnt quite the appropriate metaphor for the experience of seeing ""Black Book"" (though I can think of a few movies for which it might apply); rather the film is a decidedly mixed experience. Van Houten a young veteran of Dutch film and television is a sparkling presence with her curly smile and jaunty walk; early in the film while shes still a bit lighthearted shes irresistible. Her character Rachel Stein takes on the name of Ellis de Vries for her spy work; as Ellis she becomes blond red-lipsticked and resolute. Koch (the spied-upon playwright in ""The Lives of Others"") brings a sad humanity to his character and the two have genuine chemistry despite the soaring-violins melodrama of their circumstances. Their performances and Verhoevens ability to give a nearly 2 1/2-hour film a breathless pace make ""Black Book"" never less than watchable. But its essential trashiness too often takes over. Rather than wondering about Rachel/Ellis dilemma you find yourself pondering Verhoevens consistency in setting up bedroom shots so that theres always a nipple in the frame. And the filmmaker (who co-wrote the script with Gerard Soeteman) is fond of foreshadowing to an extreme degree. ""Well never be separated again"" cries Rachel joyously upon being reunited with her family very early in the film. Upon hearing that you know exactly whats going to happen to her unfortunate family -- and seconds later it does. Ultimately Rachel/Ellis is a survivor (sometimes of Rasputin-like proportions) and theres something satisfying in watching her face her trials and endure -- and in watching the face of van Houten who may well be on the verge of international stardom. Does this film trivialize its subject? Yes but in an oddly sincere way. Its a World War II soap opera at times compelling but ultimately fleeting; a strange brew of equal parts earnestness and froth.

Little else seems to be missing from this work of wild-eyed archaeology -- not the slime or drool spurting blood throbbing engines screeching tires or jeopardized women. Yet value has been added as well -- the most thrilling car chase ever committed to film a sequence that also shows by cutting to the psychosexual chase why fans embraced the tawdry genre in the first place. ENLARGE The whole thing runs a bit over three hours goes by swiftly contains countless film references and includes hilarious fake trailers. The first half of the program ""Planet Terror"" is set in a small Texas town where zombies have been spawned by a chemical experiment gone awry. Mr. Rodriguez wore all the hats -- wrote directed produced shot and edited -- just as he had done on a 7000 budget for his 1993 debut feature ""El Mariachi."" But this like its companion piece is far from a low-rent affair -- its only made to resemble one with simulated scratches. Unless youre partial to pustules needle sticks and necrotizing lesions youll find plenty of dull spots in the elaborately choreographed loathsomeness. At the same time though ""Planet Terror"" is enlivened -- and bedeathened -- by the bizarro husband-and-wife doctors played by Josh Brolin and Marley Shelton; by Freddy Rodriguezs Wray a mythic loner descended from Zorro by way of spaghetti Westerns; and especially by Rose McGowans Cherry the dancer whose munched-off limb is replaced first by a table leg and then by a machine gun. As heroines go Cherry is in a class by herself and a grind house emblem straight out of Krafft-Ebbing -- a beautiful babe whos both maimed and all-powerful. Quentin Tarantinos film ""Death Proof"" is much the superior of the two a high-speed hybrid that juxtaposes comedy jeopardy a psycho killer and an action climax of remarkable emotional intensity. (The writer-director also served as cinematographer.) Unlike Mr. Tarantinos convoluted ""Pulp Fiction"" this shortish film has a linear plot thats easy to convey -- so easy that Ill pass on conveying it for fear of spoiling the grisly fun. Suffice it to say that the story starts in an Austin restaurant where three attractive young women are making sweet music out of casual conversation. (No kidding; the flow of language is at once musical and intricately feminine.) The psycho killer Stuntman Mike -- hes played with malign brio by Kurt Russell -- sits watching them at the bar while Mikes lethal weapon his muscle car sits waiting on the street. ENLARGE Sydney Tamiia Poitier (left) in Grindhouse More than one chase ensues and more women become involved. One of them is played by a real-life stuntwoman from New Zealand Zoe Bell -- she was Uma Thurmans stunt double in both volumes of ""Kill Bill."" Her stunts look too preposterously dangerous to be real but none of the action is fake. Neither in the end are the nuclear explosions of rage and revenge that make Thelma and Louise look like rogue Girl Scouts. Real feelings such as those fueled the grind house furnace. The Hoax Truth takes a holiday in ""The Hoax."" This study of world-class mendacity stars Richard Gere as Clifford Irving the writer who in the 1970s faked an authorized biography of Howard Hughes. Mendacity hardly hints at Irvings M.O. He embroidered on an epic scale told ever bigger lies with ever more indignant conviction about his access to the reclusive billionaire. Mr. Gere an actor with a quick wit and a nimble mind gets at this sociopath energy wonderfully well so in one sense my first sentence is a lie -- his portrait feels essentially true. Yet Mr. Gere is also a movie star of uncommon charm and he makes his subject much more dynamic than Irving has seemed to be in public -- in a ""60 Minutes"" interview for instance thats included in the DVD set of Orson Welless ""F for Fake."" Its a good thing he does. Whether or not the truth always outs we dont always need it to. ENLARGE Richard Gere in The Hoax At least half of ""The Hoax"" is a giddy pleasure. The director Lasse Hallstrom must have been as high on the storys savor -- the period details the workings of the publishing industry -- as Clifford Irving was on his own cockeyed enterprise. (William Wheeler adapted Irvings book of the same name.) Its fascinating to watch the perfervid Irving trying to channel Howard Hughes as he writes his bogus bio. Marcia Gay Harden channels Shelley Winters as Irvings wife and Alfred Molina is sensationally funny as Irvings co-conspirator and Sancho Panza Dick Susskind; that almost amounts to a co-starring performance official credits notwithstanding. But the narrative engine leaves the rails when Irving like Hughes plunges into paranoia (though Irving actually is the object of a high-level plot) and the style turns to the sort of intensely manipulated surrealism that Charlie Kaufman practiced not successfully in ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" If truth be told this story works best when its allowed to tell itself. Black Book Like it or not and I like it a lot ""Black Book"" -- made in the Netherlands mainly in Dutch and German -- functions as a kind of anti-Anne Frank. Thats not to say Paul Verhoevens film is anti-Semitic. To the contrary its valiant heroine is Jewish a former cabaret singer and current drop-dead beauty named Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) whos been living in a hidden room with a gentile family in rural Holland during World War II. But ""Black Book"" is serious about its subject in some startlingly unserious ways. Once Rachel is forced to leave her hiding place she dyes her hair starts calling herself Ellis de Vries and attains as a Resistance fighter a level of erotically infused heroism usually reserved for mainstream action thrillers. (Mr. Verhoevens previous work in that stream includes ""RoboCop"" ""Total Recall"" ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Showgirls."") And Rachel is no more an angel than the Nazi officer she falls for is a devil. (Hes played magnetically by Sebastian Koch who was the admirable East German writer in ""The Lives of Others."") ""Black Book"" is its own kind of thriller. The film is filled with the genres conventions -- suspense betrayal melodrama violence music -- and its hugely enjoyable from start to finish. (Ms. Van Houtens fire and beauty reminded me of the young Helen Mirren; shes a certified star.) Yet the script which Gerald Soeteman wrote with the director finds time to deal with Dutch collaborationists to suggest the shades of virtue and vice that colored Hollands Resistance and to dramatize the chaos that accompanied the Liberation. As if that werent enough a preface and coda provide a reminder of what Israels sanctuary meant to Europes Jews. Not so shabby for commercial entertainment. Killer of Sheep Thank goodness Milestone Film amp; Video with some help from generous friends has made it possible for movie lovers to see first in theaters and soon on DVD a seminal American feature thats been all but invisible until recently. Charles Burnett shot ""Killer of Sheep"" in 16 mm black and white as his thesis film when he was a graduate student at UCLA in the 1970s. Though it won festival awards and was declared a national treasure by the Library of Congress (the National Society of Film Critics called it one of the 100 essential films of all time) the movie rarely showed in public partly because of poor print quality and partly because of legal problems involving music rights. Those problems have finally been solved and the film meticulously restored looks -- and sounds -- lovely in a 35 mm blowup. So what does it turn out to be after all these years? A delicately poetic essentially plotless vision unblinking but not unhopeful of life in Watts where little but the ghettos name recognition had changed a decade after the riots. Children play -- are they the sheep and poverty the killer? -- while grown-ups strive scheme and dream. Ill discuss this singular film in detail when the DVD is released in the fall but for now please seek it out if its playing in a theater anywhere near you. Theres more than enough beauty to fill the big screen.

No Urine Grindhouse is great. Too bad it cant be seen in its natural habitat. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Andrew Cooper/Courtesy of the Weinstein Company) At three hours and change boasting two rowdy full-length features a slew of garish fake coming attractions and steady eruptions of carnage and cruelty the Quentin TarantinoRobert Rodriguez collaboration Grindhouse is an ode to the era of exploitation houses and an orgy for those who want to live (or relive) the dream. Its a real Travis Bickle night outa switchback journey into the belly of the B-movie beast. First Rodriguez serves up a zombie-infection shoot-em-up splatterfest called Planet Terror which plays like a bunch of other horror movies stitched together by a sloppy but high-spirited mad scientist. Then comes Tarantinos Death Proof a more intimate and much more disturbing brew. All thats missing are the scary bathrooms and pungent aromas of urine and dope. Rodriguez has learned a few moves since his last big Tarantino collaboration the rhythmless vampire farrago From Dusk Till Dawn. In this Tex-Mex bouillabaisse he has a luscious object in Rose McGowan who opens Planet Terror with a lissome semi-naked pole dance and then sinks to the stage in tears What a soulful actress what a bod. Rodriguezs camera drinks in her pink face with its dimpled chin and pillowy red lips then hugs her long stems in her short vinyl skirt and go-go boots. There it is folksthe story in pictures of why he left his wife and kids for her. When rampaging zombies rip off one of those gams and the hot-rod hero (Freddy Rodriguez) screws a submachine gun into her stump McGowan edges out Uma Thurman in Kill Bill as the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme. The other heroine is mangled and fetishized tooMarley Shelton (the doomed beauty in the overture to Rodriguezs Sin City) as a skinny blonde lesbian doctor with a set of syringes tucked into her garter. Its always a trip to watch exploitation auteurs ogle their female characters while those ladies are busy nailing male voyeurs. BACKSTORY During Times Squares porno glory days grindhouse theaters lined the blocks around 42nd Street. But they started disappearing in the late eighties after Mayor Koch shut many down during late-night raids. Giuliani completed their eradication. The one lone grindhouse left within city limits according to the Post (which should know of what it speaks) is the Fair Theatre in East Elmhurst which opened on the heels of the 1939 Worlds Fair. It can hold 599 people and is said to have separate boothsno extra costat which patrons can privately enjoy well whatever it is they came for. Malignant machismo is embodied by Bruce Willis as an infected commando whose face begins to bubble when he stops breathing the (short-term) antidote. (I wont reveal the source of the contagionbut it has a nice resonant political tang.) Before long the maimed and the festering converge on an Austin barbecue joint where most of the ensemble is shot blown up or dismembered. This isnt your usual exploding-blood-squib splatter by the way; think exploding water balloons. In Planet Terrors brief but tumultuous running time Rodriguez pays homage to a long line of directors from Howard Hawks to George Romero to John Carpenter to his bad-boy buddy Tarantinowho shows up as an actor in his favorite kind of role a sexual sadist who gets a gory comeuppance. Which brings us to Death Proof in which the murders are more shocking insofar as the characters are viewed as something other than receptacles of blood and pus. What makes some critics knee-jerk derision of Tarantino so vexing is that hes more than a violence peddler. Hes a predatory humanist. He loves just to hang out with his soon-to-be-beleaguered characters in this case two sets of women. The first threea celebrity Austin D.J. known as Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) and her friends Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito)are chafing under their roles as women of color and objects of lust. (Of course they do stretch out in short shorts for our delectation.) In a local bar and chili parlor a pair of geeks (director Eli Roth and Omar Doom) plot ways to get the women drunk and into bed. But theyre lightweights beside the scarred macho man (Kurt Russell) at the bar who calls himself Stuntman Mike does John Wayne imitations and drives a black Charger he boasts is reinforced for high-speed collisions and rollovers deathproof. The scene in the bar goes on and on to the point where you wonder just what the point is although Rose McGowan is delightful in an entirely different role a blonde hippie chick and as Tarantinos camera arcs around the room the dread becomes increasingly hard to dispel. The second set of women show up before weve fully digested the fate of the first group. But these are ladies of a different stripe fresh from a movie shoot a makeup person (Rosario Dawson) an actress in a flouncy cheerleader uniform (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and most significantly a pair of stuntwomen (Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms) who gush about vintage speedsters and car movies like Vanishing Point and Dirty Mary Crazy Larry macho girls behaving badly. Its the other side of the grindhouse from Russ Meyers boobalicious kickboxers to Pam Griers foxy vigilantes. Chicks you mess with at your peril. Death Proof like all of Tarantinos work exists in a strange space between homage and masturbation. Its a grim stalker picture a car-chase picture and a raucous anthem to female empowerment. Its also a small masterpiece dredged up from the psyche of a movie freak who loves women onscreen almost as much as he loves to punish women onscreen and who (this is what makes him an artist) gets off most on his own ambivalence. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

Have I got a lulu for you Black Book may be the looniest use of the Holocaust as a playground since Roberto Benigni served up his infernal clown act in Life Is Beautiful. The difference is Benigni turned cartwheels for laughs while Paul Verhoeven -- yes that Verhoeven the Dutch filmmaker whose Hollywood resume includes Basic Instinct Showgirls and Starship Troopers -- approaches his historical soap opera with cold-eyed seriousness. The result isnt without its queasy fascinations. By the time she has joined the Dutch Resistance changed her name dyed her nethers and accepted the assignment of seducing a Nazi bigwig (The Lives of Others magnetic Sebastian Koch) in order to spy on his headquarters young Ellis de Vries (Carice van Houten comely and abundantly naked) has already survived more than her share of perils including the murder of her family. Then once Ellis is on the inside Verhoeven and his screenplay collaborator Gerard Soeteman indulge their basic instincts for sexual and political power games Whos dominant whos submissive and whos due for a reversal of fortune. Yet for all the moral rug-pulling -- the Nazi who turns out to have a conscience the partisans who betray one another -- theres little collective value to the assembled transgressions. Relentless plot twists only guarantee that nearly every character experiences some sort of triumph as well as some sort of shame or humiliation. (Only one however is punished with a torrential shower of human excrement the kind of baroque Verhoevenian invention that keeps audiences murmuring ""How European"") Black Book is the first picture the director has made in his native country in two decades and the furlough from Hollywood has reinvigorated him. Hes now energized to declare -- with devilish skill -- that Life Is Ugly.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Wednesday April 4 2007 400 AM View the photo gallery ""Black Book"" World War II drama about a Jewish singer who joins the Dutch resistance. With Carice van Houten Sebastian Koch. Director Paul Verhoeven (225). R Violence language sexuality/nudity. In English Dutch German Hebrew with subtitles. At E-Walk Union Square 14 UA East Lincoln Plaza. Twenty years after his first Hollywood hit ""RoboCop"" and 12 years after his first Hollywood bomb ""Showgirls"" Paul Verhoeven returns to his native Holland to direct that countrys most ambitious movie the 22 million ""Black Book."" This is a big fast-paced colorfully populated thriller that has a lot more in common with Verhoevens Hollywood movies than such Dutch gems as ""Soldier of Orange"" and ""Spetters"" that got Hollywoods attention in the first place. Set in Holland near the end of World War II ""Black Book"" stars the luminous Dutch beauty Carice van Houten as a Jewish singer who joins the resistance assumes a new identity and infiltrates the local Nazi command by seducing Gestapo boss Ludwig Muentze (Sebastian Koch) with whom she then falls in love. That an obvious sweetheart like Muentze could head the occupations notoriously brutal secret police is just one of many improbabilities in the overheatedscript by Verhoeven and collaborator Gerard Soeteman. What theyve concocted is a classic potboiler with multiple villains double agents double crosses and a couple of endings too many in a story that just happens to occur during World War II. And Verhoeven - I dont know how else to say it - has a voyeuristic tic that has informed everything from his Dutch films to ""Basic Instinct"" ""Showgirls"" and now to the repetitious exploitation of van Houten. Im not complaining mind you but few actresses have spent more time in the buff than she has. She even has a below-the-waist Sharon Stone moment. But like Stone in ""Basic Instinct"" van Houten has an audacity to match Verhoevens. Hers is a role that Bette Davis would have killed Ingrid Bergman for and she is so good in it that it seems only a matter of time before shell star in a real Hollywood movie - as opposed to this pretender. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Black Book | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; black-book ) Black Book (Netherlands/Belgium/United Kingdom/Germany 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the 1980s and 1990s Paul Verhoeven made a name for himself in Hollywood directing such high-profile films as Robocop Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers. Before arriving in America however Verhoeven had a flourishing career in the Netherlands where he cut his filmmaking teeth. For Black Book a film he has been writing (on and off) for 20 years he has returned to his roots. The result is a powerful and compelling World War II thriller that features note-perfect performances and an almost flawless screenplay. Verhoevens sure hand honed as a result of 15 years of big-budget features gives Black Book a polished look that few American war movies can exceed. An element of controversy has shadowed Black Book because Verhoeven has the temerity to portray resistance fighters as less-than-heroic and one high ranking Nazi as a nice guy. Many male directors have difficulty handling strong female protagonists but that has never been the case with Verhoeven. In fact in the directors most infamous work Basic Instinct Sharon Stone outclasses Michael Douglas at every turn. Douglas may be the hero but Stone is the one everyone remembers. So it is fitting that the central character in Black Book is a woman. And not just any woman - Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) is a no-nonsense heroine. She doesnt stammer falter or fall prey to stupid plot clichA(c)s. She does what must be done to solve a problem whether thats dying her pubic hair blond (that stings) bearing her breasts to a boorish soldier or sleeping with an SS officer. She suffers grief and falls in love but never do her emotions betray her or slow her down. In todays world of dumbed down characters most men arent given the kind of respect accorded to Rachel let alone women. Its 1944 in Holland and Jewish singer Rachel Stein is in hiding. A brief reunion with her family turns to tragedy when they are betrayed and gunned down by a group of Nazi soldiers. Rachel is the lone survivor. She hooks up with the Dutch resistence led by businessman Gerben Kuipers (Derek de Lint) and doctor Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman). At first she does menial jobs but is eventually ""promoted"" to a position of importance. She is chosen to seduce an SS officer Ludiwg MA1/4ntze (Sebastian Koch recently seen in The Lives of Others) who is attracted to her. The seduction is easy but Rachel traps herself by falling for the dashing man who risks his career and life to protect her when he learns her secret. Once the Allied victory arrives circumstances become grave for Rachel and MA1/4ntze as they discover that the end of the war doesnt mean the end of betrayals and killing. Black Book possesses a taut exciting script that throws surprises at the viewer on a regular basis. To say more would potentially spoil the fun but there are two things to keep in mind. None of the twists are Hollywood contrivances and no life is sacrosanct. Having made that point however I must voice one objection about the manner in which Verhoeven elects to present the story. He does so by framing it as a flashback between two scenes that take place in 1956. Since Rachel is alive and well in 1956 we know she does not die in 1944. This recognition defuses some of the suspense that would have been present had the film not let us know at the outset that the heroine would survive. Black Book is gripping enough that there are times when the viewer may almost forget this. Im not familiar with Carice von Houten although her filmography lists a substantial number of credits in Dutch productions. Having viewed her fiery performance in Black Book Im an instant fan. This is fearless camera arresting work. Despite some fine acting by a variety of co-stars theres no doubting that von Houten owns this movie. Not since Ellen Ripley (of the Alien series) has there been a female protagonist so strong and heroic. Verhoevens last few years in Hollywood were not happy ones; if this is the kind of work he can produce by returning to his native country then I urge him to stay there. This is one of the best war movies to emerge about World War II in the last ten years. It has everything a good war thriller should have impeccable period detail wonderful performances action romance tragedy and heart-stopping suspense. Black Book offers the best of both worlds Hollywood spectacle and European sensibilities. Its 145 minutes well spent.

By Anthony Lane Sebastian Koch and Carice van Houten in Paul Verhoevens new movie.   Credit KARL WALTER/COURTESY SONY PICTURES CLASSICS The new Paul Verhoeven film ""Black Book"" is set almost entirely in Holland during the later stages of the Second World War. It charts the efforts of a young Jewish woman named Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) to survive and prosper. She hides out with a farmers family then teams up with her own relatives and tries to flee the country on a barge. They are betrayed and slaughtered; Rachel alone escapes and joins the Dutch Resistance. Here she is allotted the task of seducing Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch) the courteous stamp-collecting head of the local Gestapo. How one might ask did he rise to his present position? Did he torture his suspects with a pair of philatelists tweezers? From here the film is entwined in double crosses strokes of luck and panicky exchanges of gunfire. Somebody within the Resistance is in league with the Germans; for more than two hours Verhoeven keeps us on what he believes to be tenterhooks before revealing the villain. By this stage the war is over with Allied troops being feted in the streets and the unfortunate Rachel accused of collaboration. Her fate should hang in the balance but since the opening scene of the film shows her teaching in a kibbutz in 1956 the scales are decisively tipped. According to rumor ""Black Book"" marks a purified moment in the career of Paul Verhoeven. It is the first film that he has made in his native Holland in more than twenty years; it is also said to prove that he has put away childish things--""RoboCop"" ""Basic Instinct"" ""Showgirls"" and the other baubles of his Hollywood years. The first inkling that this might not be so comes with the attack on the barge. Rachel though shot in the head swims to safety with the wound diminishing swiftly to a nasty graze and one scene later to an unblemished brow. Such is the template to which Verhoeven cleaves no suffering is so dire that it cannot be endured and then erased to be replaced--in Rachels case--with an indomitable smile. After her first encounter with Muntze on a train (he offers to carry her bags unaware that they are stuffed with weapons) she strolls away down the platform with a puff of relief on her lips. You could take this I guess as a convincing dramatization of courage. In Holland as in other occupied countries acts of resistance were carried out with exemplary coolness. A browse through Elsa Casperss ""To Save a Life Memoirs of a Dutch Resistance Courier"" published in 1995 confirms as much and I suspect that Caspers was a useful source for Verhoeven and his co-screenwriter Gerard Soeteman. ""To Save a Life"" however is rooted in moral stamina and the harshness of deprivation; the winter of 1944 and the succeeding months (the time frame of ""Black Book"") saw the Netherlands besieged by famine with people grating tulip bulbs to make soup. None of that desperation pinches Verhoevens film. Resisters and collaborators alike are elegantly dressed with plenty of flesh on the bones and some of Rachels escapades have the casual air of a spree. This is not to diminish the brassy performance of Carice van Houten whose cheeriness is tinged with a mania that recalls other Verhoeven blondes. To avoid detection she bleaches not only her locks but her pubic hair finely focussed groin-baring being the price of admission to the Verhoeven pantheon. The trouble with ""Black Book"" is that in urging us to admire the resourcefulness of a character--a Jewish woman pretending to serve the Nazis--it hopes to cover up its own deceit. This is trash pretending to serve the cause of history a ""Dirty Dozen"" knockoff with one eye on ""Schindlers List."" Everything about it from the earnest strivings of the musical score to the beery gropings of the Germans has the whiff of soap opera. At one point the sanitization is literal Rachel arrested as a traitor is stripped to the waist and drenched in human excrement. There may be grounds for showing such maltreatment but there are none for what happens next--a shot of our heroine scrubbed and untraumatized leaving the scene with her rescuer a Resistance friend and walking out into the sunshine. Is that how Verhoeven thinks that individuals let alone countries emerge from humiliation? Far from turning serious the director of ""Basic Instinct"" has proved that when it comes to grappling with good and evil his instincts arent basic enough. On a related subject can you swallow a Jewish Richard Gere? The question spills naturally from Lasse Hallstroms film ""The Hoax"" which delves with such gusto into the mechanics (not to mention the ethics) of gullibility that by the end we are forced to ask Who can tell the guller from the gulled? Clifford Irving--a true figure still alive today--was an author of minor repute who in 1971 conceived a scam that in its formal beauty would surpass anything else to which he put his name. ""Im working on the most important book of the twentieth century"" he declares bursting into the offices of McGraw-Hill in New York to the annoyance of his editor Andrea Tate (Hope Davis). Irving claims that he has been asked to research and prepare--in short to write--the autobiography of Howard Hughes a man whose public appearances are slightly less frequent and less reliable than Bigfoots. A likely story. So likely in fact that Andrea and her superiors including the president of the company (Stanley Tucci) lunge at it with their tongues hanging out. As Irving says ""I handed them three yellow letters they gave me half a million dollars. Is that plausible?"" It was he of course who faked those letters which purported to come from Hughes himself and suggested Irving as the right man for the job. The whole thing is a fix dreamed up by Irving and his best friend Dick Suskind (Alfred Molina) and the comic glee that enlivens the first half of ""The Hoax"" springs from their astonished realization that they might by a whisker get away with it. So sure is Hallstroms pacing that you barely notice the withering moral of the tale when the money is big enough everyone is a mug. ""The Hoax"" is a much smarter and more diverting picture than ""The Aviator"" which for all its pizzazz did the one dull and hollow thing that you can do with Howard Hughes it bought his story straight. It was a McGraw-Hill kind of movie with a fancy cover. Hallstroms effort shot by Oliver Stapleton is no less fun to ogle--check out the sofa covers the textured wallpapers and the resplendent pertness of Hope Davis in her kneecap-grazing dresses of 1971--but its writhing narrative scripted by William Wheeler pulls it away from Scorsese and closer to the tall doubt-haunted stories of Jonathan Demme whose ""Melvin and Howard"" (1980) offered Hughes as a mad old motorcyclist in the desert and of Orson Welles who took one look at Clifford Irving and pulled him out of the hat in ""F for Fake"" (1974). There in interviews we encountered the real Irving sly sociable and dangerously sane. As Welles asked going straight to the heart of the matter ""Does it say something for this age of ours that he could only make it big by fakery?"" Gere is a slippery customer no question and I heartily applaud his wig but does he glow with the grandeur of the born charlatan? Tucci say might have done a more rambunctious job. As for Alfred Molina he could have played almost any role in the movie; we first see him for no good reason in a wetsuit and from then on he delivers a matchless portrayal of a rubber soul. As portly and hangdog as Charles Laughton Molinas Suskind is breathlessly out of his depth forever imagining extra hiccups and glitches to go with the real ones. ""What if Im a Russian?"" he asks approaching a security cordon at the Department of Defense. (Irving shying from the dirty work gets Suskind to steal a Hughes-related document.) Their kinship--wholly unsexual yet lit like that of Martin and Lewis with an exasperated love--is the beacon of the movie and it just about survives the lengthening shadows of the later scenes. Hughes sensing an opportunity really does make contact with our bewildered hero trying to use his book as a tool with which to jab at President Nixon. Suddenly we are plunged into talk of Watergate and airline-industry deals and the joy starts to drip from the movie which cannot quite bear so much reality. Irving himself grows deluded and paranoid like the John Nash of ""A Beautiful Mind"" but who wants another frowning film about conspiracy theories? Isnt it enough to make sport of the suckers who believe them?  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

If the Jews had listened to Jesus grumbles the father of the Dutch family sheltering her they wouldnt be in such a mess now. It is September 1944. Rachel drizzles a crucifix of jam into her porridge smiles ingratiatingly and vigorously stirs.Vigorous stirring is Paul Verhoevens stock-in-trade. As the Netherlands most successful filmmaker of the 70s and 80s he alienated critics and funders with his frank treatment of aggression libido and ethical equivocacy. Following his move to America his use of sex and violence in the likes of Robocop Basic Instinct and Showgirls prompted further consternation now compounded by his willingness to play as fast and loose with expectations of genre as he always had with character and narrative; Starship Troopers for instance was accused of promoting the very fascistic tendencies it satirised. Uniquely Verhoeven makes populist films that challenge audiences to keep their distance - to acknowledge that the character with the most lines might not be a nice person that plot can be a conspiracy against reason that violent or sexual behaviour can be both more and less consequential than Hollywood convention insists. In short his pictures thrive on irony and the superb gripping Black Book is a double-faced affair. His first Dutch production in two decades uses Rachels experiences to hold a glass to the little-examined period of Dutch history around the end of WW2. Her family lost the former singer falls in with a Resistance cell is given a new identity and infiltrates the local SS HQ via a liaison with senior officer Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch). As the Nazis crumble and Rachel begins to glean the contents of the titular logbook however she realises she may have less to fear from the disarmingly decent Muntze than the heroes of the underground or a vengeful public.For Verhoeven the ostensibly heroic and dutiful are rarely distinguishable from the venal and inane; even Soldier of Orange (1977) adapted from the memoirs of one of the Netherlands most celebrated WW2 fighter pilots presented the war more as gratifying adventure than noble struggle. That films Hague liberation sequence was blithely jubilant; its counterpart here is a nightmare ordeal in keeping with the plots other reversals of historical expectation. Such reversals divorce the global from the personal and focus attention on Rachels bizarrely ambivalent position as the Jew singing at the Nazi soiree. Like Katie Tippel (1975) and Showgirls Black Book charts the progress of a woman set on survival and independence and willing to use sex. Rachel is more sympathetic but just as canny and she takes to her role-playing life with aplomb. Van Houtens barnstorming performance accentuated by a bold saturated palette makes comparisons to Garbo and Jean Harlow plausible but Rachel is far from the only character well-versed in the uses of glamour. A noble visage or political assumption might distort as much as a small black book reveals. Best not judge by covers.

Endless car crashes and shoot-ups to a frenetic music score are reminiscent of the Keystone Cops. The film is crammed with incident but ultimately is very shallow. The tone is all wrong from a very early scene in which the heroine on witnessing a direct bomb hit on the farmhouse where a family with numerous children has sheltered her remarks simply Ive lost my hiding place"".

Pic should easily slide into the black in non-Anglo territories where the largely Dutch-German dialogue wont be a problem. Hollywood-honed tech smarts and European character sensibilities mesh entertainingly in pacy WWII resistance thriller ""Black Book"" helmer Paul Verhoevens first feature in his native Netherlands for more than 20 years. Fictional tale about a young Jewish woman who falls for a Gestapo officer while seeking revenge for her familys murders moves like an express train across almost 21/2 hours without any sense of rush and with strong empathetic characters etched en route. Pre-sold to 50 territories (though so far not the U.S.) pic should easily slide into the black in non-Anglo territories where the largely Dutch-German dialogue wont be a problem. Anyone expecting a return to the rough socially transgressive pics that Verhoeven first made a name with in the Netherlands will be disappointed by ""Black Book."" Film plays like a Euro version of his Stateside movies -- a technically slick mainstream production that toys around in subtle ways with the genre in which it moves. This could prove a problem in the U.S. as the film defiantly doesnt fall into the normal Hollywood-style heart-on-sleeve template of nasty Nazis persecuted Jews and unconflicted resistance warriors. Its also many notches above his earlier WWII drama the heroic ""Soldier of Orange"" (1977) in complexity and production values. Reunited with Dutch scripter Gerard Soeteman with whom he made cheeky early classics like ""Turkish Delight"" ""Spetters"" and ""The Fourth Man"" Verhoeven has seemingly rethought all the usual cliches of WWII dramas. And as usual he decided to mess a little with his audiences head. There are no simple heroes or villains in the fast-paced heavily plotted pic. And though theres little out-and-out comedy theres still a sense of Verhoeven and Soeteman having some fun while keeping viewers on their toes and occasionally letting rip with gunfire and action. (Latter is always explosively staged with granite-hard bullet play.) Story is bookended by scenes on an Israeli kibbutz in 1956 where Rachel Rosenthal nee Stein (Dutch thesp du jour Carice van Houten) accidentally meets former wartime friend Ronnie (Halina Reijn spirited). This spurs one long flashback to WWII. The brief return to Israel at pics end contains one rapid visual trope that may pass many auds by. Main story starting in Holland in September 1944 plunges straight into the action with Rachel hiding out in the countryside with a strict Christian family. From the off Soeteman keeps the dialogue loaded -- ""If the Jews had listened to Jesus we wouldnt be in the state were in now"" quips the familys sour-faced paterfamilias (Bert Luppes). But mostly he keeps the story moving forward in rapid brush-strokes. Rachel narrowly escapes being blown to smithereens is reunited with her family as theyre shipped south by mysterious resistance worker Van Gein (Peter Blok ghoulish) and is the only survivor when their boat is ambushed by an SS craft commanded by leering Guenther Franken (Waldemar Kobus earthy). Assigned the name Ellis de Vries she gets work in a food plant run by communist resistance worker Gerben Kuipers (vet Derek de Lint) and five months later is involved in undercover missions. During one of these she gets to know local Gestapo chief Ludwig Muentze (Sebastian Koch) whom she first beds on resistance instructions and then falls for while working in his office. In the same office is Franken whose sexual needs are catered to by co-worker Ronnie an easy-come easy-go girl. Thats just the first hour of an incredibly dense plot that sees Muentze morph into a sympathetic character -- and not through any simple conversion. Also the loyalties of the resistance workers all come under suspicion when an opportunity to rescue Kuipers imprisoned son goes horribly wrong. When peace is declared the story is far from over with multiple twists in the tale. Notably film uses no docu footage or devices like newspaper headlines to bolster the ongoing sense of the war and Nazi power waning. Focus is always on the (sizable) cast of central characters and even Rachel/Ellis Jewishness becomes almost peripheral to the action. Both that and all the characters conflicted emotions are treated in an unsentimental practical way as the tumblers in Soetemans tightly constructed script click into place. Rarely off-camera Van Houten only 29 throws herself into the part of a lifetime with a face that can spin on a dime between fear defiance caprice and caring. But for all of Verhoevens technical skills the film still wouldnt work without her on-screen chemistry with Koch (the writer in ""The Lives of Others"") who makes Muentze a tragically flawed figure rather than simple villain. All the films reported 22 million budget -- largest ever for a majority Dutch-language production -- is up on the screen with costumes and production design having a convincingly lived-in feel. Anne Dudleys big orchestral score is too generic and themeless but along with the trim editing does keep the full-bodied widescreen lensing by d.p.
