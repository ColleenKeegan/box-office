When brilliant young scientists Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) and Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley) secretly create Dren (Delphine Chaneac) - a wide-eyed and strangely beautiful hybrid of animal and human DNA - they quickly realise that their scientific hubris far outstrips their parenting skills. Due to her accelerated development Dren soon develops from an innocent dependent infant into a rebellious adolescent. Influenced by her own troubled childhood Elsa becomes a cruelly controlling mother; father figure Clive on the other hand is seduced by the perverse attraction that the now sexually aware Dren feels for him. Having spent more than a decade in utero the dense script by director/co-writer Vincenzo Natali (Cube Cypher) is like the fussy creature design over-elaborated. That said it is fascinating to see the arrogant human scientists revealed as monsters even as the monstrous Dren reveals her complex vulnerable humanity. Sadly the intellectual sparks that do fly burn brightly but only briefly.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 04 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Splice Directed by Vincenzo Natali Written by Vincenzo Natali Antoinette Terry Bryant Doug Taylor Starring Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody Classification 18A A good horror flick always does metaphoric battle with our interior demons and Splice summons them in impressive numbers. On the surface its a classic Frankensteins monster tale albeit ramped up to a modern lab and outfitted with the latest in biotechnology. Yet below that in a vast sub-layer of twisted psychology theres a whole lot going on. Perhaps too much - this is one of those genre films that really wants to show off some smarts to set itself above the common beast but that cerebral badge sometimes seems a bit ponderous and in a realm where the visceral rules a little counterproductive. Then again in these summer days of brain-dead blockbusters why complain? Long-time partners in and out of the laboratory Elsa and Clive (Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody) are a matched pair of not-so-mad scientists. We first see them genetically splicing another matched set a couple of pulsating pupae coyly named Fred and Ginger - when not jitterbugging in their incubator they serve as freshly minted protein for hungry livestock. The labs head honchos couldnt be happier - seems theres big money in the feed business. Of course being hubristic geniuses Elsa and Clive want to push the genetics that crucial step further whipping up a ""human/animal hybrid."" Now you might well argue that from the annals of Greek myth to the history of political despots to the playing fields of sport such hybrids arent exactly in short supply. No matter. Off go the deep thinkers to their furtive cloning and right quick out pops (and hops) a squeaky little thing coated in slime and boasting a tail. Once we get some windy medical exposition out of the way (""It would help the millions of people who are suffering and dying"") this is where matters start to defy our expectations and thus get interesting. Daddy Clive wants to abort this slimy experiment but Mommy Elsa argues strenuously to bring it to term. Soon the thing has a name - Dren (anagram of ""nerd""). And then it has a sex - female. And damned if Baby Dren although missing a few fingers and toes doesnt sprout into the cutest of tykes all wide-eyed and spiffed up in her tiny blue dress. Sure she cries a bunch is a fussy eater and often stinks but Mommy is bonding fast - Daddy not so much. Alas fated to age at an accelerated rate (plots love that conceit) Dren grows up fast into an aggressive teenager with venom in her tail and the urge to fly on newly protruding wings. Thats when the parental dynamic changes. A suddenly cruel Mom who has dark maternal issues buried in her own past is literally tying the girl down while a confused Dad finds himself predatorily attracted to Drens youthful flirtatiousness. With that change comes a corresponding shift in our sympathies and our fears Just who is the monster here and where exactly on the human/animal spectrum does that monstrousness reside? This thematic evolution emerges slowly over two acts even as the picture quietly sustains like a 60-cycle hum in the background the conventional element of Frankenstein suspense. Because this much is certain Theres a beast somewhere in this jungle just waiting to spring. When it does the demons both real and metaphoric disappoint a tad. The climax proves more whimper than bang although the story is easily strong enough to grip us tightly until then. So are the performances. These typically arent actors movies yet Polley and Brody both round out their characters nicely giving them credible weight but not an excess of gravity. Better yet despite acting under the computer-generated encumbrances of that monkey tail and those centaur legs Delphine Chaneac does something remarkable with Dren - she makes her a disturbingly sexy thing. As for Vincenzo Natalis direction the glass-is-half-full crowd will laud it as efficient and unostentatious others as merely workmanlike and lacking in style. Either way he succeeds in driving home the domestic point because ultimately this picture itself is a hybrid marking that scary place where the horror film meets the relationship movie. There the mundane gives birth to the monster the one - big or small male or female young or old - who sits across the kitchen table and changes its mood without cause and its look without warning and prompts that most terrible cry of alarm ""I dont even know who you are any more.""

Clive and Elsa head a multimillion- dollar research facility. The fact that Wired magazine put the pair played by Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley on its cover doesnt make it much easier. The hipster pair seem a little too cool for geek school. How cool? Their research facility goes by the acronym N.E.R.D. They do their work splicing different species DNA to create new living forms while listening to indie-rock and jazz grooves. They wear black leather to meetings with the pharmaceutical honcho who funds their research (Simona Maicanescu in a suggestive understated turn). If dragon-tattooed Lisbeth Salander werent so antisocial shed be Elsa and Clives pal. Yet once the leap is made this tale of good and evil -- and way too much know-how -- keeps you thinking. Not simply pondering the ethics of bioengineering -- thats rather tired -- but also looking at the moral challenges of parenthood in a tweaked context. And because Natali plays with questions -- but doesnt settle on answers -- ""Splice"" raises uncomfortable gender notions it doesnt resolve. After successfully engineering a male and female of a species the cocksure duo get upended when the deep-pocketed corporation wants them to shift their research goals. No more splicing. Which leads to one more clandestine splice. This time they use human DNA. When the creature designated H-50 arrives shes scary -- not least because Elsas in the lab alone and can hear something scurrying and weve all seen ""Alien."" More telling The creature is frightened. She tries to flee. She peeks out from toppled shelving. She looks like a trapped hairless rabbit shaking on baby ostrich legs. Natali and creature- effects guy Howard Berger create a being both unnerving and sympathetic. Fred and Ginger were the critters that Elsa and Clive initially trotted out for investors. Those gelatinous- looking beings have nothing on ""Dren"" as Elsa names her. As she ages she develops a preternaturally lovely face. Her body suggests not so much an animal amalgam as it does a meeting of angel and demon. Newcomer Delphine Chaneacs approach to the character elicits tenderness and suspicion. Each is deserved. What makes ""Splice"" morally compelling isnt the bioethics quandaries it raises so much as the way it delves into parenthood. Dren grows at such an accelerated rate Elsa and Clive get a time-lapse lesson in parental bonding discipline teen rebellion. Alas its not a lesson they should have undertaken. ""Splice"" R for disturbing elements including strong sexuality nudity sci-fi violence and language. 1 hour 44 minutes.

Their goal to hybridize animal DNA to come up with creatures who will be a fountain of new proteins and compounds that the lab can patent.Heres where the ""mad scientist"" part comes in Elsa thinks it would be cool to throw some human DNA into the mix. Whoops bad idea.Thats the setup for Splice an engrossing if flawed techno thriller that never quite goes where expected and thats what makes it such a pleasant surprise. Instead of being a retread of the monster-on-the-loose scenario the story offers something more complicated.The result of Elsas brainstorm whom they name Dren (long story) possesses animal and human characteristics. This forces Clive and Elsa into an emotional place where issues of man and nature life and death creation and control are suddenly center stage. Movie Information SpliceRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Vincenzo NataliStarring Adrien Brody Sarah Polley and Delphine CheneacRun time 104 minutesMPAA rating R (disturbing elements including strong sexuality nudity violence strong language)Synopsis Two scientists merge human DNA with their created animal species and get some frightening results.More movies from GuideLive.comKept by the couple in one of the labs secret rooms Dren ages at an accelerated rate - shes an amazing CGI effect as a youngster and played by Delphine Chaneac as a young woman. They bond with her partly out of neediness for whats missing in their lives.But they know that if shes discovered by the outside world shell either be killed or used as a guinea pig. They also come to the realization that as she takes on more human sensibilities they shouldnt be keeping her against her will either.Directed and co-written with Dallasite Antoinette Terry Bryant by Vincenzo Natali who made a splash in the late 90s with Cube a low-budget yet chilling slice of sci-fi Splice percolates with the big issues of the day without feeling forced and heavy-handed. At its best its Frankenstein for the Internet age.So its somewhat disappointing that in the final act and spurred by a plot twist that might repulse some viewers and collapse others into laughter Splice follows more of a standard-issue chase scenario setting up things quite nicely for a sequel.Still for all of its flaws Splice is something unexpected. It has more on its mind than blowing stuff up. Maybe these scientists arent so mad after all. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Starring Adrien Brody Sarah Polley David Hewlett Amanda Brugel Delphine Chaneac Abigail Chu Brandon McGibbon Stephanie Baird Director Vincenzo Natali Running time 144 Release Opened Jun 4 2010  Editorial Review Inhuman punishmentBy Ann HornadayFriday June 4 2010The yuck factor spins off the charts in ""Splice"" a thoroughly repulsive science fiction-horror flick that slicks up its B-movie tawdriness with high-gloss production values and two otherwise classy stars. Oscar winner Adrien Brody famously kissed Halle Berry when he got his award and he apparently got some iffy career advice from her that night He delivers his own ""Catwoman"" groaner here as a brilliant genetic researcher. Sarah Polley herself nominated for an Academy Award for her screenplay for ""Away From Her"" plays his ambitious girlfriend who while working for a biotech company goes rogue and creates her own part-human part-animal hybrid.And the animal? A hairless E.T.-like creature she seems to be cobbled together from a harp seal a deer an albatross and Polley herself who possesses the same lambent dark eyes and ethereal pallor. As the being -- which the protagonists name Dren -- grows the three form a weird kind of family unit with the usual psychodramas and tensions. When its not trafficking in creepy images of gooey squishy things that go blurp in the lab ""Splice"" trots out every tired plot trick and risibly sudden reverse (""You never told me you had a farm"") in the how-not-to-write-a-screenplay book.Horror movies have always been defensible for offering either catharsis or camp value. ""Splice"" boasts neither even though a scene of a bunch of stockholders getting splattered with mutant guts could have qualified as a kitsch classic. Instead ""Splice"" joins Warner Bros. similar offering from this time last year ""Orphan"" as a singularly cynical enterprise exploiting our anxieties about reproduction parenthood control and betrayal while engaging in the crudest forms of sensationalism. (The movie contains not one but two scenes of interspecies sex each with its own incestuous overtones.)Its difficult to know who the filmmakers hold in more contempt in this goopy gory grotesque exercise the characters or the audience. Either way you slice or dice it you get the same result Yuck. Contains disturbing elements including strong sexuality nudity sci-fi violence and profanity.

Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play a superstar geneticist couple who at one point debate abortion in Vincenzo Natalis smart scary -- and at times very funny -- horror movie ""Splice."" The fetus in question has been engineered from the genes of various animals -- as well as Polleys character Elsa. Brodys Clive whose ethical concerns have been pushed away by his girlfriend wants to destroy the hybrid embryo before it comes to term as they previously agreed. But her burgeoning maternal instincts prevail. Needless to say keeping this particular baby turns out to be a huge mistake. Clive and Elsa (amusingly named for the stars of ""Bride of Frankenstein"") work for a bio-med company thats pressing them to monetize their earlier gene-splicing experiment -- a pair of tongue-like creatures theyve dubbed Fred and Ginger -- before it goes belly up. The couple is so preoccupied with their latest hybrid -- which they hide from their colleagues -- that Fred and Ginger end up giving investors a demonstration thats unforgettable in ways that are entirely unforeseen and quite hilarious. Clive and Elsa are busy in the basement raising the rapidly growing feral creature (Abigail Chu with lots of help from computer-generated images) that Elsa names Dren (spell it backward). The childless Elsa is so captivated by Drens capacity for learning that shes willing to overlook her offsprings increasingly homicidal tendencies -- another mistake when your ""daughter"" has a lethal stinger in her tail. Elsas boyfriend meanwhile tries to drown Dren after some particularly nasty misbehavior -- but wouldnt you know it shes sprouted a set of gills. Then they move her to a barn on Elsas old family farm where Elsa starts putting Dren in dresses and makeup. Dren (now played by a digitally enhanced Delphine Chaneac) begins to resemble a cross between a bald supermodel and a rabbit with wings. Even Clive has developed paternal feelings at this point which Dren very unfortunately mistakes for an entirely different kind of love. Im not going to give away anything more except to warn that the film includes various combinations of incest bestiality and rape -- though the gore and violence are relatively modest by contemporary horror film standards. Brody and Polleys performances keep the film grounded in a semblance of reality even when it threatens to go over the top near the end and director Natali infuses the proceedings with a consistent sense of nail-biting dread. ""Splice"" whose DNA includes a bit of ""Rosemarys Baby"" as well as many other movies is a hybrid with enough surprises to qualify as one of the few high points in a disappointing movie season so far. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next College of musical knowledge Read Next College of musical knowledge Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46534 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22434 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 17212 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Joe Neumaier Thursday June 3 2010 501 PM facebook Tweet email In Vincenzo Natalis ""Splice"" Sarah Polley tries to make friends with a creature she created with Adrien Brody. (Warner Bros.) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 3 2010 501 PM Title Splice For all the jolts gore and horror a scary movie is all about mood. If the tone is off even a notch an audience will laugh instead of scream or roll their eyes rather than shut them. ""Splice"" is an unholy mess because it fuses together the worst parts of every bad medical-monster thriller and then boldly cranks up the ridiculous.Adrien Brody - sorry Oscar winner Adrien Brody - and Sarah Polley are punky biogeneticists Clive and Elsa (apparently named for Colin Clive and Elsa Lanchester who played the mad scientist and his creation in 1935s ""The Bride of Frankenstein""). They prance around their lab in pajama pants and get frisky as they fuse animal DNA. Clive meets with patent companies while wearing T-shirts emblazoned with snarky phrases. And they give cutesy names to their giant wormy creations aka ""Fred and Ginger.""That pair of gooey guinea pigs is chosen by loose-cannon Elsa for another turn of the screw An infusion of human DNA. Breaking a scientific code of ethics is one more playful challenge until their creation comes to life looking like an evil Bugs Bunny. Clive wants to kill it but Elsa thinks of it as a pet and as it grows into a chicken-legged humanoid they call Dren (""nerd"" spelled backward) more complicated issues come into play.For instance What happens when the fast-growing Dren - played with the help of some CGI by Delphine Chaneac - a bald Jeanne Tripplehorn lookalike - wants out of seclusion and threatens to use her venom-tipped tail? Is it normal for her to breathe underwater or change gender? What about the wings that make her look like a 1970s heavy-metal album cover? And what should Clive do when Dren comes on to him?What audiences will likely do during most of director Vincenzo Natalis movie is snicker. Since this Toronto-filmed tale has no specified setting it essentially exists in early Cronenbergville. It wants to tour the scarred human psyche yet the cobbled-together screenplay is silly when it should be spooky cold when it should boil over and dumb when it should be smart.Polley plays Elsa as emotionally immature though the reasons for that are barely touched. Meanwhile Brody goes for the petulant approach with his Jack White hair only accentuating his Cubist facial features. As performers theyre capable of more except Natali wanted to do a kind of Canadian-grown ""Species.""And in a flick about a man-made monster there needs to be at least a few big ""Wow thats intense"" scenes.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Splice Science fiction. Starring Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody. Directed by Vincenzo Natali. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its easy enough to stick with ""Splice"" for about half of the way. It stars Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody as a team of genetic engineers - you know like Dr. Frankenstein - and something in their personal dynamic is arresting. Subtly but unmistakably she is the stronger partner the one truly gifted and the one most likely to turn out to be off her rocker. ""Splice"" capitalizes on Polleys forceful personality her intelligence and her prickliness qualities already in evidence when she was a teenager. From her earliest days onscreen Polley has definitely had something but shes had precious few chances to show it. This movie doesnt even qualify as a real chance because it eventually caves in on itself. But at least Polley makes out better than Oscar winner Brody who spends his time here acting weak and dumbfounded. Director Vincenzo Natali who co-wrote the screenplay was apparently intent on offering ""Splice"" as a moral investigation into the issue of genetic engineering. Yet for all its surface seriousness ""Splice"" is a regulation monster movie. So however somber it gets its never truly thought-provoking and however outrageous it gets its still always 20 minutes behind the audience. Its just too dumb to be serious and too slow to be entertaining. Photo Warner Bros. Pictures AP Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 In this film publicity image released by Warner Bros.

Delphine Chaneac left and Sarah Polley are shown in a scene from ""Splice."" Photo Warner Bros. Pictures AP Review Splice scientists cook up DNA monster 1 / 1 Back to Gallery It does however manage to be disgusting which could have been interesting in a creepy sort of way had the movie wed the ugliness to an overall mood. Here its just gross The ambitious doctors create the first genetically concocted life-forms two blobs the size of badgers. Then Elsa (Polley) gets more ambitious. She takes the blob DNA and combines it with ... human DNA. And the result is some horrible thing that starts out looking like a chicken with a babys head and then grows into some terrifying bald girl (Delphine Chaneac) with pretty eyes and ghastly birdlike legs. From here we more or less know where ""Splice"" is going which means that the filmmaker had only two sensible options He could do the obvious but do it immediately so as to arrive at some fascinating aftermath the audience doesnt expect. Or he could upend audience expectation and take the story in a complete other direction. Alas he does neither. Instead he over-invests in the story of Elsa and Clive (Brody) and tries to make us care about the psychological dynamic between them and this monster-girl theyve created. The strategy fails as Elsa becomes repellent and Clive becomes first a cipher and ultimately an amazing idiot. The cave-in becomes complete at the point that we understand why Clive is such a washout - if the filmmaker made him any stronger Clive would be able to advance the action but this filmmaker has nowhere for the action to go. He has no new idea. To his credit director Natali does include two of the most disgusting sex scenes this side of David Cronenberg and thats something. But poor Sarah Polley. I thought it couldnt get worse than having sex with the monster in ""Beowulf amp; Grendel"" but apparently it can get worse much worse. Funny how some perfectly nice women just have awful luck with men. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations gruesome sights and violence.

Pictures Clive (Adrien Brody) may soon regret helping to concoct Dren (Delphine Chaneac) an animal-human hybrid. ABOUT THE MOVIESplice   (out of four) Stars Adrien Brody Sarah Polley Delphine ChaneacDirector Vincenzo NataliDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for disturbing elements including strong sexuality nudity sci-fi violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 44 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Beware of unassuming nerds warns Splice. Theyre just a notch away from mad scientists. Who knows what manner of perverse monsters they can concoct when they set their minds to it? VIDEO Watch the trailer Splice is the tale of a mutant creation the crowning achievement of a pair of romantically linked biochemists (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) who clone hybrids of animals with human DNA. The result of their tireless efforts is Dren a goggle-eyed being who grows to look and act more human over time. Though a stylish thriller with an initially palpable sense of menace and kinky tension the story takes such ridiculous turns that it ends up undercutting its initial promise. What began as something fresh degenerates into the same slithery goopy bloody horror flick weve seen before. Too bad because theres undoubtedly an innovative angle to be taken on genetic engineering. Brody plays Clive a scientist who doesnt do much more than look pained and feebly beg his lab partner/girlfriend Elsa (Polley) to consider the moral ramifications of her scientific obsessions. The non-infant Dren is played by Delphine Chaneac and assorted CG parts. Chaneac emits only weird cries and whines and is limited to making the facial expressions of a confused toddler. Its good to see Polley back on screen after her successful turn behind the camera directing 2006s Away From Her. She brings a measure of intelligence to the one-dimensional role. But her part has big holes. The story raises questions about her damaged upbringing then inexplicably drops them. And poor Clive lacks the motivation for his climactic actions. With seamless special effects director Vincenzo Natali creates a believable hybrid creature that alternately elicits fear revulsion and sympathy. But when the creature matures into a bald dancing teenager with hormones in overdrive the film devolves into a silly fright-fest with a predictable chase scene conveniently set at a remote farmhouse. There are plenty of unintentional laughs as the films tone morphs as much as the monster at its center. But then switching gears from bio-thriller to steamy sex drama to gruesome horror flick is bound to produce some blowback as well as an implied sequel.

In the slyly cheesy Splice a pair of married scientists blithely tromp through natures domain genetically engineering a human hybrid with the potential to be Frankensteins Monster crossed with Rosemarys Baby. The movie is ridiculously over the top inelegant and so defiantly crazy that it works reminding you how fun gore and creatures that go bump (and grind) in the night can be. Its a sci-fi horror film but no actual comedy has made me laugh as much this year as Splice . (See the 50 best inventions.) Clive (Adrien Brody Oscar winner -- just in case you forgot) and Elsa (Sarah Polley Oscar nominee) are the hot young stars of creepy genetic research. Theyve spliced together various genes -- some porcine -- and grown a pair of hideous beasts called Fred and Ginger which look like what might happen if an elephant foot and a freestanding penis could reproduce. (See TIMEs 76 things to do see and hear this summer.) This breakthrough lands Clive and Elsa -- presumably writer-director Vincenzo Natali is deliberately referencing Elsa Lanchester and Colin Clive co-stars of The Bride of Frankenstein -- on the cover of Wired magazine and earns them the gratitude of some nefarious pharmaceutical corporation with plans to harvest Fred and Gingers ""proteins."" Dont sweat the details of the weird science; the movie certainly doesnt. I just ignored Clive and Elsas lab talk which tended toward statements like ""It must be rogue elements -- junk genes pushing through"" and concentrated on what delicious horror would come out of the incubator next. Because obviously once youve made matching sets of elephant hoof- penis babies youll want to move right to combining human and pig genes with perhaps a soupcon of bald eagle. And you certainly will want to do this all secretly without telling your boss Barlow (David Hewlett) or in Clives case his dopey brother-lab assistant Gavin (Brandon McGibbon). Clive it must be said is sensible enough to want to kill the rapidly growing fetus that results but Elsa insists they keep this half-plucked chicken with a human(ish) head alive. She christens it Dren (nerd spelled backward) puts it in dresses and introduces it to the evil pleasures of high- fructose corn syrup. Elsa is one of those women who dont want to have babies -- it would overcrowd their apartment etc. -- which in the emotional parlance of mainstream moviedom makes her ripe for punishment. It gives us leeway not to worry too much about her fate if and when Dren should develop say talons and a stinger. But for a reluctant novice Elsa takes to parenting with the kind of obnoxious zeal recognizable to anyone who has ever been in a new-mothers group. And because Dren ages rapidly were able to watch Elsa cycle through all the stages of parenthood including the ugly teen years. The same goes for Clive who starts out jealous of the attention Elsa gives Dren. (""Youre treating her like a pet"" he protests.) Early on Clive tries to drown Dren during a cold bath to counter a mysterious fever. Instead he revives her. His expression -- Oh sure I meant to do that -- is priceless. Its no wonder Dren regards Clive with the cowering hostility of an unwanted animal. But soon enough Clive is playing good cop to Elsas bad-mother cop introducing to the film all the dramatic possibilities of an Electra complex and allowing Natali to paint a gleeful send-up of modern parenting. Its a treat to have actors of Brodys and Polleys caliber in what is essentially a B movie. Most members of the supporting cast are amateurish and awful. The exception is Delphine Chaneac who plays the postadolescent Dren. The computer-generated imagery that gives her various odd bits including faun legs is seamless resulting in a magnificent creature and Chaneacs performance is spookily beautiful and witty. The movie has a fascinating relationship with predictability. Of course this happy family will have to move to an abandoned home in the country. And when they do were pleased on multiple levels. Theres the recognition that Natali is sending up the genre parodying it even but also the anticipation of the suspense to come. You think Look at these dopes Are they going to get what they deserve or what? But sometimes that predictability is merely predictable. By the time Elsa performs a ""surgery"" thats meant to represent a mothers darkest most desperate urges to control a wild teen my interest in her as a character had waned. The films conclusion feels inevitable including a last reveal that doesnt surprise. But rather than dwell on it I think fondly back to the scene when Clive and Elsa panicked by Drens racing off into the darkness on her first night in the country come upon their ""daughter"" in the woods. She turns to them smiling sheepishly through bloody rabbit guts. Like Splice shes hilarious naughty and excitingly creepy. See Clint Eastwood at 80 A life in pictures.

"Splice Gods and monsters | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSplice Gods and monstersIn Vincenzo Natalis new hybrid horror film Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody are genetics researchers who get way too involved in their work.Adrien Brody and Delphine Chaneac star in Splice.  (SUBMITTED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 3 2010Splice (out of 4)Starring Sarah Polley Adrien Brody and Delphine Chaneac. Written and directed by Vincenzo Natali. 104 minutes. At major theatres. 18A""Its not your daddys creature movie"" Sarah Polley said at the Sundance premiere of Splice a hybrid horror that seems dangerously close to advancing reality.Polley wasnt joking -- this movie is rad dad -- but parentage has broader and scarier implications here than in monster movies of yore.Article Continued BelowWhat exactly is it that Polleys Elsa and Adrien Brodys Clive have cooked up in their gonzo genetics lab? And should they kill it rear it or send it flowers?Torontos Vincenzo Natali (Cube) owes a debt to two Davids Cronenberg and Lynch and also to executive producer Guillermo del Toro. But Splice which Natali directed and co-wrote (with Doug Taylor and Antoinette Terry Bryant) is much more than the sum of its influences. Natali is totally in command.Hes been thinking about the story for a decade keeping pace with DNA research that is now perilously close to crossing the animal/human divide. He asks the right questions about the moral implications of not just playing God but also mother father ... and something else.The answers arent so easy and they lead to the deliciously twisted tale of Splice which also comes with a dangerously pointed tail.Elsa and Clive a young married couple still hot for each other are ""transgenic developers"" for Newstead Pharmaceuticals an international firm that goes by the motto ""Designing a Better Tomorrow."" In their lab which has the winking acronym N.E.R.D. they use animal DNA to create organic compounds and proteins that will not only improve livestock feed but which could lead to cures or treatments for the human diseases Parkinsons Alzheimers diabetes and even cancer. Their corporate masters (David Hewlett and Simona Maicanescu) just want to make a profit and if they can help mankind in the process great. They tolerate barely what Elsa and Clive really want to do which is to create new life forms achieved by splicing together mammalian amphibian avian and other non-human DNA.Elsa and Clive (Google those names with Bride of Frankenstein) arent in it for the money. They drive an ancient Gremlin live in a funky apartment decorated with manga posters and have only their love to keep them warm. Clive would like to start a family but Elsa only wants to grow things in a test tube. They already have family togetherness in the lab since Clives brother Gavin (Brandon McGibbon) works with them.Its all about science to them -- or is it?The couple have had a few misfires in their paired creations -- ominously named Sid and Nancy and Bonnie and Clyde -- but they come up with a more harmonious duo they call Fred and Ginger. These creatures resemble something out of a porno filmmakers wet dream (""So cute"" Elsa trills) but theyre just the opening act for Natalis talented design and effects team. Splice has weird creatures to spare and theyre amongst the most convincing ever put to film. The eye blithely accepts them as real. The main attraction is too good to say too much about. Its a life form that results when Elsa impulsively adds some human DNA to the chicken soup of genetic material that she and Clive have been working with and all those movies theyve seen (and us too) about monkeying with Mother Nature suddenly come true.They call their rapidly growing creation Dren (read it backwards) played by Abigail Chu as an infant and the remarkable French actress Delphine Chaneac as a fully grown ... whatever. Its the ""whatever"" stage where things really get interesting.The budget for this Canadian film shot in Toronto and Hamilton was about 30 million which is high for a Canuck movie. The sci-fi stuff looks like it cost five times that much to create.But the special effects and creature design as good as they are dont exceed the acting by Polley Brody and Chaneac who make it all seem entirely plausible and emotionally real. Motivations are always in question as Clive and Elsa take turns scolding each other each time a boundary is crossed each trampled ethic and law making the reasons for the experiment seem more like excuses. Dren also has thoughts and feelings which ""complicated"" only begins to describe.""Was this ever about science?"" Clive asks.Im amused to learn that Chaneac listened to classical music and to Goth rockers The Cure while preparing for her role. Now theres a hybrid for you. But it fits with Splice a film about cross-species tinkering that is all too human in the skewed way it recalls Dr. Frankensteins famous boast ""Its alive""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Movie review Splice - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review SpliceThe film about an animal-human hybrid deftly grafts well-drawn characters and suspense.June 04 2010|By Michael Ordona Special to the Los Angeles Times ""Splice"" is a hybrid that works. Its a smart slickly paced well-acted science-fiction cautionary tale-horror movie-psychological drama. In its mix are ethical quandaries in biotechnology nature versus nurture and an adorable-sexy-disturbing monster. So theres that. But it wins best in show by focusing on one of the weirder relationship triangles in recent memory. Elsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive ( Adrien Brody) are brilliant scientists creating genetically modified organisms to harvest proteins that might cure diseases. Their crowning achievement is a pair of multi-animal creations that resemble massive fleshy worms. When they realize theyre about to lose the chance to pursue their ultimate goal a a human-animal hybrid ( George W. Bush was right) whose proteins could defeat cancer and other scourges a they rush to finish their work. As Clive says ""Whats the worst that could happen?"" As one might imagine the worst is more than a Petri dish of nonviable goo. The resulting creation Dren resembles a rabbit-cat-human infant at first (the visual effects are top notch) something downright huggable. They start off so cutea|. The clever script and grounded performances a especially by Polley a convincingly sell the ""good idea at the time"" hubris of geniuses making horrible decisions. Polleys Elsa is a multilayered person balancing an aversion to motherhood with deep-seated maternal yearnings. Perhaps the films most interesting and nerve-jangling component is the evolving dynamic among the childless couple and their experiment-pet-baby-monster. The authenticity of that triangle is sure to generate some of the most uncomfortable laughter youll hear at a movie this year. The film avoids clichA(c) and has several effective reveals and genuinely funny moments including one of the least-encouraging shareholder meetings ever. As the boss who is very worried David Hewlett is hilariously unhappy. Delphine ChanA(c)ac who plays Dren for most of the film marries the behaviors of several animals with the emerging consciousness of a human being. calendarlatimes.com ""Splice"" has echoes of ""Aliens"" and ""Frankenstein"" but whatever components the film is sewn together from it feels original. Thats largely because of the seriousness with which the characters and their qualms are explored. The film earns its freakiness Director Vincenzo Natali and company have wisely realized that if situations and conflicts are believable first and foremost the experience will be far more immersive a and intense a than the usual jumping-out-of-cupboards nonsense.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The genetic-engineering chiller ""Splice"" is a double helix of perversity. Canadian director Vincent Natali borrows freely from his countryman David Cronenberg in this tale of suspense sexual transgression and body horror (the term for films that find their disturbing effects in physical deformity mutation or disease). Without Cronenbergs masterful way with visuals or his penetrating intelligence the films deliberately provocative premise is worked out in broad lurid comic-book strokes consciously calculated to shock the easily shockable and titillate the peculiar. In this mad-scientist yarn Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play bio-researchers who are also life partners nervously dancing around the issue of having children. Clive and Elsa (whose names echo those of featured actors in ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" -- the script has its flashes of wit) are more adventurous in the lab. They have synthesized a new life form that resembles a garden slug the size of a pot roast. In pursuit of prestige and profit-sharing (the pair have been featured in Wired magazine and have their eyes on a sumptuous new loft) they secretly create a transhuman creature whose genetic makeup might yield new medicines. The dithering morally ambivalent Clive cant decide if he wants to kill the creature; Elsa is as fiercely protective as a lioness. Their offspring Dren rapidly matures into a bald lissome adult female mutant picture Sinead OConnor with computer-generated chicken legs and a tail with a phallic ""stinger."" To prevent her discovery by their prying corporate superiors the pair raise her in a remote farmhouse a location that unlocks a trove of disturbing memories from Elsas troubled childhood. The trio take the concept of family togetherness to unhealthy and unorthodox extremes. Lets just say someone should have called the Department of Mutant Child Protection and Family Services. Several characters die; how their vanishing is explained to the authorities is never addressed in the film at all -- its just that kind of a film. Polley a reliably impressive performer covers a rich emotional range convincingly while Brody repeatedly hits sour notes of overacting. The actress who wordlessly portrays Dren Delphine Chaneac responds feral-animal style to her co-stars. Its a challenging provocative role and she handles it well. SPLICE  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for disturbing elements including strong sexuality nudity sci-fi violence and language. ""Splice"" deserves credit for a novel take on a familiar theme and for aiming to disturb us by pushing the boundaries of behavior instead of unleashing buckets of gore. But it loses points for uninspired execution. With its dreary lighting cable-TV-movie photography and shoestring sets the film shouts ""budget-strapped indie"" from every frame. The gravest failure of craft however comes in the writing. The film has no clear purpose no lucid message. It dwells on grotesque sex -- I havent heard so many ""ewwws"" from an audience since the last ""Jackass"" movie -- but toward what end is never apparent. What allegorical force it does build up is dissipated by the cliched switcheroo ending. Maybe if you see it on Netflix in a couple of months youll catch the moral. Explain it to me then.

Blood? Gore? EwwwwSplice an unsettling intelligent and way-out-there experiment in bio-terror from Canadian director Vincenzo Natali targets the chromosomes. Splicing human with creature DNA? WhoaNot since David Cronenbergs sexual-parasite tale The Fly (1986) have I physically experienced horror on the molecular level.Frankenstein for the genetic-engineering generation Splice itself splices together the mad-scientist story with a satire of modern marriage and parenting. While the results are mad brazenly unethical and occasionally funny the implications are deeply upsetting.The film focuses on married geneticists Clive and Elsa (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley). Movie geeks will recognize that these hipsters (who dress like club bunnies rather than lab rats) are named after Colin Clive and Elsa Lanchester the mad scientist and his creation in The Bride of Frankenstein.Clive and Elsa are protein breeders. By splicing DNA from disparate animals they look to synthesize a protein that will save lives - and their pharmaceutical companys bottom line. Married to their research they are thisclose to achieving their goal.But when the mating dance between their lab-created organisms ends in disaster the couple regroup. Clive kinda wants to make real babies of their own but Elsa - due to childhood horrors the movie alludes to but does not detail - is maternally disinclined.She believes that the only way to create the protein that killer app her company so desperately wants is to introduce human DNA (her own) into the test-tube recipe. It goes against protocol not to mention Clives express wishes but Elsa does it anyway. Quicker than she can say ""Rosemarys baby"" theres an embryo developing in the lab tank.Terminate or gestate?The pro-choice/pro-life debate is one of many hot buttons pushed by Natalis film. Can a baby save a marriage? Can parenting an infant heal the emotional wounds of childhood? How do we emotionally bond with creatures that are not fully human? Natalis horror movie stealthily morphs into a relationship black comedy before darting off again into other unexpected terrain.Given the far-fetched and occasionally risible plot Polley and Brody resourcefully ground their performances in relationship reality which focuses the viewer on the emotional and ethical stakes rather than on the fantastic scientific breakthroughs.Elsas offspring named Dren (read it backward) is gracefully and chillingly played by Delphine ChanA(c)ac who suggests a CGI-augmented combination of Margot Fonteyn Gollum and a T-rex. It is a tribute to Natalis stylish direction and the films heavy-breathing sound design that Dren seems entirely plausible even when the movie does not. Mess with Mother Nature the film tells us and her unnatural spawn may bite back.Biologists and bioethicists might shudder at the films contempt for lab protocols.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + If its discouraging -- or at least disorienting -- to see that Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley have signed on to a gnarly work of science-fiction horror lighten up. They have good taste in schlock. Its true we see neither of them often enough at the movies but ""Splice will more than do for now. The film which Vincenzo Natali directed and co-wrote has several good ideas and the sort of fine surprises that happen only when the director has nerve.Brody and Polley play Clive and Elsa a couple of rock-star genetic engineers (thats them on the cover of Wired) whod rather please themselves than obey the ethical cloning concerns of their corporate bosses. (The lab is called Nucleic Exchange Research and Development -- or NERD.) Clive and Elsa are partners in life and at work and genetics obviously doubles as their baby. That metaphor gains specificity after their gene-splicing technology produces a creature that develops from scurrying tumor into the sort of hot bald semi-reptilian woman -- played by Delphine Chaneac -- youd expect to see in an campaign for alien couture.They name the creature Dren and hide her away at a wintry country house that belongs to Elsas family. The movie is committed to showing Clive and Elsa make science while dressed like two people standing behind the turntables at a German disco. Dren develops like a fetus growing outside the womb going quickly from pet to child from child to seductress. How do you feed her? She wants ""high-sucrose foodstuffs Elsa reports. ""But her mind remains a mystery.Not really. Dren grows violently bored with her barn life and in one nice sequence appears biologically equipped with a means to escape. The movies best instincts are all parental. Elsa had a complicated relationship with her own mother; and Polley smartly quietly taps into the exasperation of becoming someone you dont like be it the woman who raised you or the women whose careers are their families. Indeed while Clive goes to work Elsa stays home with Dren who much to Elsas disgust is a daddys girl. Mom is forced to be the disciplinarian confiscating pets and raising her voice.The movie begins to run out of gas as it racks up a body count but even the mad-scientist and I-created-a-monster cliches are contorted satisfyingly enough. Natali directed a good little horror film in 1997 called ""Cube which was a proto-""Saw. Hes moved on to slightly more sophisticated intellectual climes and from the looks of the effects and art direction in ""Splice a bigger budget. But Natali has brought with him his elemental interest in human nature and enthusiasm for David Cronenberg. (With this film ""Repo Men and ""The Human Centipede Cronenberg is more in vogue than ever.) ""Splice even appears to be situated in that directors chilly Canadian wilderness.Happily Natali is his own director. He locates a kind of strain of godly narcissism lurking in many science-fiction pursuits. ""Splice doesnt overextend its reproduction allegory. But regarding Clive and Elsa Natali does leave room for unanimous conclusion. These two should have adopted.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Lovers and genetic engineers Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody play a childless couple in Splice. That doesnt mean however that theyve never created life. As scientists they can claim Fred and Ginger two lab-grown specimens made from mixing material from several different animals. The creatures look a bit like what might happen if a slug devoured a turtle but looks dont really matter in the world of corporate science. Yet despite their success Polley and Brody soon face a change of duties that will take their gene-splicing toys away. But not that is until they make one last go-for-broke creation that throws in a little human DNA just to see what happens. That Brody and Polleys characters are named Clive and Elsa should alert fans of old horror movies what sort of story theyre in for and director and co-writer Vincenzo Natali (best known for the microbudgeted cult favorite Cube) doesnt let down those expecting a 21st century twist on Frankenstein. He throws in elements of David Cronenbergs The Fly too but ultimately Splice owes as much to David Lynchs parenthood-inspired Eraserhead as any other film. For all the gleaming technology and echoes of cloning stem cell research and other contemporary issues the horror here stems from the couples attempts to keep a fragile newborn creature alive and do right by her as she grows. Their experiment with creating a human-animal hybrid at first yields an awful hatchet-headed monkey-thing with big expressive eyes that send Polleys maternal instincts into overdrive. Calling it ""Dren""--the name of their employer Nerd spelled backwards--Polley and Brody take to raising it as their own first in secret corners of the lab and then on an abandoned family farm. Dren ages rapidly and begins to look and act more human or at least human enough to stir feelings of concern and discomfort in her creators as she matures into a melancholy willful creature played by Delphine Chaneac. Played with black humor that never gets in the way of the horror Natalis film cleverly exploits Drens uncanny semi-humanity. As a child she wears a happy expression but her bald head and the tail poking out beneath her dress give her away. Later the camera lingers on Chaneacs supple thighs as they rest atop what looks like the lower legs of a shaved mule. Brody and Polley attempt to protect her from the world only to watch her turn rebellious and resent them for it. Any resemblance to the actual experience of parenting is of course not at all coincidental. Shooting with a cool reserve and a steely-blue color palette Natali keeps the film unsettling by using icky creature effects but just as often by offering up grotesque caricatures of real-life parenting discomforts from the exhaustion to the collapse of privacy to the difficulty of instilling a moral code in an offspring that often seems alien. The film keeps a sometimes too-clinical distance but pushes buttons from afar including a final act that turns into a series of outrages bound to upset audiences who might have stumbled in expecting the usual monster-of-the-week horror movie instead of this thriving disturbing thoughtful mutant of a movie.

Comments (7) Splice Recommended Video Rated R  107 minutes  2010 Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley star as cutting-edge geneticists whose secret experiment splicing together human and animal DNA yields a darling little girl with a stinger crooked legs and eyes in her temples. Fearing exposure at their corporate lab they take the creature home to their apartment then out to their house in the country; shes the daughter theyve never had but as she rapidly grows from childhood to adolescence additional mutations begin to develop. Echoes of James Whales Frankenstein movies reverberate through this creepy Canadian sci-fi tale whose innocent confused beast is alternately terrifying and pathetic. But the movie carves out its own psychological terrain as well pondering the emotional storms of both childhood and parenthood as relations in the little family grow ever more peverse.

Splice Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2010) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/splice-2010,200,splice23,splice,rogerebert
"Splice | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; splice ) Splice (Canada/France/United States 2009) June 02 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The trailer for Splice might lead a viewer to expect a low-budget retread of Species crossed with Aliens. However although the film does indeed pilfer a scene directly from the latter movie the trailer misrepresents its source. Splice is as much a psychological thriller and drama about bio-ethics as it is a horror movie. Like the vastly superior The Fly it uses gore sparingly; delivering shocks to the audience is a secondary consideration. Despite its relative bravery in choosing not to embrace the Grand Guignol Splice is a little too hit-or-miss to truly work. Theres a lot going on in the movie - some of which is rich compelling material - but director Vincenzo Natalis scattershot approach to his subject matter leaves the viewer left with a frustrating sense that interesting paths were bypassed in service of a narrative that offers few surprises and concludes with a cornball jarring sequence that belongs in another movie - perhaps the one being advertised by the aforementioned trailer. The curtain rises on a small group of scientists feverishly working in a laboratory that seems decidedly behind-the-times technologically. They are led by Clive (Adrien Brody) and his girlfriend Elsa (Sarah Polley) the masterminds behind a genetic splicing project that has pharmaceutical implications. Clive and Elsa have plans to go beyond the creation of a pair of slug-like creatures that have excited their corporate sponsors - they want to do things with human DNA. This possibility is quickly shot down by their boss (David Hewlett) but that doesnt stop the headstrong Elsa from moving ahead followed meekly by Clive. Soon using a high-tech womb the scientists have given ""birth"" to Dren (Delphine Chaneac) a hybrid of human and various other creatures who walks on two legs (although they look more like the limbs of kangaroos than people) sprouts wings breathes under water and can communicate using Scrabble letters. Shes also sexy and sexual as Clive comes to learn when Dren develops a crush on him. The creatures final most surprising ability is left undiscovered until the movies final fifteen minutes when unfortunately the filmmakers decide to undermine their story by revealing it. My best guess is that director Natali and his two co-writers intend for this to be as much a cautionary tale and a meditation on bio-ethics as they want it to be a cross-breed horror/science fiction tale. There are some problems though. First their approach is naA-ve in the extreme; they address questions that have been debated for decades in more enlightened forums. Most of the concepts they attack here are recycled. Issues of this sort have been discussed and debated as far back as when Mary Shelly wrote Frankenstein. To an extent Splice is all about mans hubris and how he copes when his abilities outstrip his morality. Basic questions bubble to the top. How deep does a creators responsibility run to its creation? What does it mean to have sex with such a creation incest infidelity or something otherwise creepy? If nothing else Splice provides a unique take on the Elektra Complex. The movie would work better if the characters came across as organic rather than appendages of a screenplay. There are numerous leaps of logic - instances when the protagonists act in a fashion that only movie characters would. Their cavalier attitude toward leaving Dren to her own devices is inexplicable. She is a unique creation - emotionally fragile with unknown physical limitations (not to mention how much money she could be worth to the right buyer) - yet they leave her alone in a barn. Its almost as if the movie is determined to italicize how incredibly stupid and inept these supposedly brilliant scientists are. They can create life but are unprepared to cope with the result of their creation. Maybe thats a metaphor for modern-day parenting or maybe Im reading too much into Natalis underwritten script. The special effects that bring Dren to life are less than impressive. At best she looks like something out of an R-rated episode of Star Trek. The breasts would seem to be the actress own but everything from the waist down is the product of CGI and it shows. Based on her work here its impossible to assess Delphine Chaneacs aptitude in front of a camera. The same cannot be said of either Adrien Brody or Sarah Polley. Both actors have done exceptional work in the past (he won an Oscar; she has provided equally amazing performances albeit in smaller productions); this is not their finest hour. One can only hope they were handsomely paid. Theyre not terrible but they dont add anything to Splice beyond name recognition than that which could have been provided by a pair of unknowns. Splice might have been more enjoyable as an unabashed B-movie. The production is watchable but the experience of sitting through it offers equal parts frustration and satisfaction. Its easy enough to appreciate the movie for its differences while at the same time acknowledging that not all those differences work. Splice is ambitious which is always preferable to the opposite but it never delves deeply into the cavalcade of ideas it touches. Instead of taking a real chance the finale devolves into a generic genre ending (although maybe this is intended to provide an origin story for the Jersey Devil). Splice isnt a disaster and it will probably fool a percentage of its audience into thinking its saying something new or offering a previously unexplored narrative approach but neither is the case. The movie contains the embryo of a worthwhile motion picture but the full potential for development is never fulfilled.

Big mistake. Scientists whether sane or mad should never treat their lab subjects like offspring. Disaster is inevitable. But Clive and Elsa have obviously never watched Frankenstein (or any of David Cronenbergs films)  and the movie none-too-subtly lets us know theyre thinking about starting a family. Why not try things out with this deformed mewling slug? The horrible-yet-strangely-cute mutant grows up quickly (she ages days within minutes) and becomes Dren (Delphine Cheneac) a humanoid with peculiar characteristics such as vaguely supermodel looks wings that sprout when she becomes angry or aroused and a tail with a phallic stinger that pumps poison. Dren is usually gentle - she likes kittens sugary foods and playing with toys - except when she throws a tantrum in which case tranquilizer darts and a titanium steel cage might come in handy. But Clive and Elsa who have squirreled Dren out of their laboratory and to a remote farmhouse where they can raise her away from their meddling bosses havent really prepared for the worst-case scenario. Splice was directed by Vincenzo Natali who made the fiendishly creepy low-budget shocker Cube and he fares well in the scenes depicting a pre-grown Dren and her brethren - fleshy formless slugs you dont know whether to pet or euthanize. But although Brody and Polley do their best to sell the increasingly illogical behavior of their characters Splice grows progressively sillier the older Dren gets finally resorting to chases in dark woods and sudden gotcha appearances by a pissed-off mutant who is none too happy about the corrective behavior her parents have planned for her. The creature effects are terrific but the human protagonists arent nearly so interesting and the dont-mess-with-nature message is too hoary to be made interesting with this feeble setup. By the time the films climactic 15 minutes rolled around viewers at a preview were laughing as if they were watching The Hangover. For a horror picture such a reaction is the equivalent of a stake through the heart. Splice ( out of ) opens Friday June 4 in South Florida.

Maybe Saw in 3D will win your heart ) Posted by sugahoneyicedtea | June 02 2010 at 0312 PM I thought it was ok. Id have given it 2 1/2 stars. I was expecting more. I liked ""Cube"" ""Cypher"" and ""Paris je taime"". Vincenzo has a pretty good track record. At the very least its not a remake re-boot or a sequel. Posted by mrbluelouboyle | June 11 2010 at 0638 PM To my surprise i actually really loved this film. However id hardly call it horror- i would say more fantasy or science fiction. I though the scene with dren were adorable. But didnt care much for her parents. The only thing is i think they could have maybe put in more action more random people to kill but all and all. This is a really cute movie in my opinion. Posted by kherbieL | July 01 2010 at 0406 PM The comments to this entry are closed.

Splice Director Vincenzo Natali. Cast Adrien Brody Sarah Polley Delphine Chaneac. Rating R for strong sexuality nudity sci-fi violence and language. RELATED Cinemas most memorable hybrids Sci-fi horror Its all too much in other words. With fewer of those elements the movie might have been gory good fun. Alas no such luck. Clive and Elsa (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) are hipster-genius genetic engineers who have managed to splice the DNA of different species to create a couple of disgusting-looking something-or-others to be used as proteins for pharmaceutical companies. But why stop there? Why not mix in some human DNA to spice things up? The company funding their work says no but Clive and Elsa work in secret and soon as their ""real"" work goes unattended to they create a creature that is part human and part . . . something. Looks kind of like a bird maybe. Dubbed Dren (""nerd"" backwards) it causes friction between Clive and Elsa who are also a couple. In a glancing nod to the morality of such things Clive thinks they should have killed the thing early on because its just wrong that it even exists. Elsa says no lets wait and see. The victim of an evidently terrible childhood at the hands of an abusive mother Elsa has been adamant about not wanting children of her own. But as Dren grows she gives her dolls and puts her in dresses and starts acting suspiciously like a mommy. When Dren grows too large to be hidden in the lab (her growth is greatly accelerated) Clive and Elsa move her to the farm where Elsa grew up causing Elsa to deal with unhappy memories. But feelings begin to shift as Dren matures. Then things really get weird. Director Vincenzo Natali who also co-wrote the screenplay creates some nicely creepy moments especially early on. He also creates some disgusting ones. Brody and Polley are terrific actors but too often theyre given some really head-scratching (or stomach-turning) things to do. Delphine Chaneac is certainly interesting as the adult Dren striking a nice balance between the human and the whatever else the creature is supposed to be. The first-rate special effects help in this regard as well. But the story even as science fiction doesnt hold up. Sometimes the plot holes are just silly. (In one amusing scene Clive tells Elsa how odd it is that he has known her all these years but didnt know she had a farm. Ha. Odd indeed.) Theres an intriguing horror film in the mix somewhere. Theres probably two or three intriguing movies in there. Trying too many things and succeeding at too few ""Splice"" isnt one of them.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Though Sundance-screened and sporting an upscale cast writer-director Vincenzo Natalis Splice has a mad science quality. He has cross-bred a self-serious psychodrama and a queasy creature-feature and unleashed this malformed freak on the world.Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are Clive and Elsa a married couple of ""rock star"" genetic engineers. Not since Hackers have such pains been taken to make a tedious sedentary undertaking seem EXTREME They crank the boom box in the lab decorate their apartment with huge manga canvases and show up to work dressed like theyve just come from a rave in Cologne.Childless and married to their work Clive and Elsa are introduced midwifing the birth of a lab-grown undulant maggoty sack of tissue which well soon observe in a mating tango thatll put you off your popcorn. Their very gross Ramp;D produces medicinal proteins for sponsor ""Newstead Pharma."" When blocked from taking this research further by corporate higher-ups afraid of public outrage Clive and Elsa decide to tamper in Gods domain for the good of all mankind and toss a soupcon of human DNA into their recipe.What winds up in the incubator is an H.R. Giger cocktail-napkin sketch a massive spermatozoon ending in an obscene glans glistening with . . . possibly soy sauce? This pupae hatches a walking skinned rabbit which develops into an increasingly humanoid girl with a wicked harelip--Abigail Chu plays the preadolescent critter--growing until ""it"" is enough of a ""she"" to require a proper name (shes christened ""Dren"") and homespun hand-me-down dresses to wear.Though hell more than accept their adoptee in time Clive is understandably creeped out at first by his wifes coddling treatment of Dren. Polleys glowing reaction shots while nestling her mutant toddler make a deadpan joke of parents indifferent pride over whatever theyve hatched as Splice becomes a parody of parenting. In spite or because of the portentous gathering-clouds London Philharmonic and accumulated Freudian gibble-gabble Splice is a queerly funny movie attuned to the absurd. Natali never drops his poker face but you cant tell me a moment like the Big Presentation where the front row of suits get splattered like a Gallagher audience isnt supposed to be a knee-slapper. Of Splices various primal scenes thats-just-wrong coitus interruptuses and ridiculous dialogues delivered with unfailing conviction (""Was it ever about science?"") I am less certain of the intention. Whatever the case watch with the right audience and youll have a party on your hands.The films first half is claustrophobically confined to austere corporate offices and fluorescent-lit subterranean labs populated by sallow scientists including Clives brother (Brandon McGibbon--having hair like a Goo Goo Dolls cover band member apparently runs in the family). Once Dren grows full-size and is at risk of being discovered the makeshift family retreats to the Southern Ontario Gothic farmhouse that Elsa grew up in. Developing at an accelerated pace into her terrible teens Dren makes runaway attempts and throws tantrums--frightening given her stinger-tipped tail and powerful multi-hinged legs. Delphine Chaneac plays the full-grown Dren with a stubbled scalp and slanted widely spaced eyes. At peace her blissy idiot grin recalls Bjork.Mapping out Splices DNA isnt too difficult. Aside from Species its near-anagram antecedent theres a touch of David Lynch in Drens bawling-Eraserhead-baby phase while the ambiguous glass-box corporate parks and squishy horror are very early Cronenberg. Clive and Elsa name their tube-grown gutbags after famous couples (i.e. Fred and Ginger) and their own names pay homage to Bride of Frankenstein actors Colin Clive and Elsa Lanchester. (Whether a writer should be relating to his characters the way they relate to their lab work is another matter--and may explain why Natalis close-ups of Brody at his most pained arent quite moving.)The detailed imagining of Drens life cycle and Splices one-upping make the movie mortifyingly fascinating and its spell lasts right up until the junk heap of a grand finale--did the projectionist platter a reel of Jeepers Creepers 3?--topped by a capstone that will please only those people who are gratified when they can guess a twist ending well ahead of time.

Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody look on the face of the future in Splice A- Splice Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Adrien Brody Sarah Polley; Director Vincenzo Natali; Author Vincenzo Natali; Release Date Limited 06/04/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 104; MPAA Rating R Posted June 4 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Like an exciting experimental genetic strain bred of time-tested DNA the cool unwieldy sci-fi horror-thriller Splice (in theaters June 4) can trace its cinematic ancestry back to Frankenstein. Yet as co-written and directed with obsessive passion by Vincenzo Natali (Cube) the movie is a cheeky great-looking thoughtfully loopy creature feature about the lure and dangers of cutting-edge gene splicing. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley bring intensity and attractive intelligence to the characters of Clive and Elsa (a little joke allusion to Bride of Frankenstein) romantically linked hotshot genetic engineers who when thwarted by the pharmaceutical company that funds them conceive their greatest hybrid experiment in secret. And behold their test-tube fiddling gives life to Dren a creature thats part human and part...thing with long hinged bird legs and retractable wings. Played to novelty perfection by French actress Delphine Chaneac Dren (another wink -- thats ""nerd"" backward) is everything amazing and unholy about the human ability to mess with creation. The outstanding creature effects by Howard Berger only get more astonishing as Splice splits into an eerie horror picture then divides again into something out of Rosemarys Baby.

The kids not alright and neither are the scientists who cooked her up in ""Splice"" a perverse peek into parenthood that doubles as an extreme cautionary tale about the perils of bioengineering. Benefiting significantly from the casting of Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley as geneticists torn between experimental ethics and love for the mercurial monster theyve created director Vincenzo Natalis outlandish sci-fier sustains a grotesque and funny fascination throughout its slightly protracted runtime. Though not outright terrifying enough for hardcore horror fans ""Splice"" could play nice at the B.O. with properly devious marketing that doesnt spoil too many secrets. Easily the sexiest genetics researchers on the planet lovers/lab partners Clive (Brody) and Elsa (Polley) have had great success recombining DNA from different animals to synthesize potentially life-saving proteins and are eager to take the next step and ""incorporate human DNA into the hypertemplate."" But they hit a wall with their corporate masters (David Hewlett Simona Maicanescu) who rule against further experimentation in favor of a less controversial more immediately profitable next step. Not one to let the bottom line hinder scientific progress Elsa defies orders and Clives protests and engineers a human-animal embryo whose gestation proves remarkably brief. The thing that pops out is a bald vaguely humanoid female with amphibious gills a stinger-equipped tail and as it turns out amazing cognitive powers and physical abilities. Clive wants to terminate the sucker but Elsa who pointedly doesnt want to have children of her own insists on keeping the specimen alive and even names her Dren (""nerd"" spelled backward). As the two study their mute mutants rapid growth while trying to keep her a secret from the rest of the lab the line between observational detachment and parental affection is repeatedly crossed in surprising giggle-inducing and insidiously creepy ways. As the pic mutates from ""Frankenstein"" into ""Mommie Dearest"" with a side order of ""Rosemarys Baby"" viewers who can suspend their disbelief may find ""Splice"" an unexpectedly plausible portrait of a relationship in crisis -- at least before its pro forma action climax and ironic but derivative denouement. Played as a child by Abigail Chu and as an adult by Delphine Chaneac -- with a huge assist from special effects designers Howard Berger and Gregory Nicotero (who developed 11 different creatures for the film) and visual effects supervisor Robert Munroe -- this splice girl is a bizarrely beautiful beast commanding both pity and awe. At times resembling a cross between Gollum and Sinead OConnor (or perhaps one of Nicolas Roegs ""Witches"") Dren leaps and flies with lithe animalistic grace yet remains pathetically earthbound by the lusts and emotions common to the human species. In classic whos-the-real-monster-here tradition scribes Natali Antoinette Terry Bryant and Douglas Taylor cleverly play out the dire consequences of Clive and Elsas actions revealing the selfish humanity beneath the dryly professional veneer. While Chaneac is the main attraction Brody and especially Polley who showed her horror chops in 2004s ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake more than hold the screen opposite their CG-enhanced co-star. Long-gestating Canadian-French production conceived not long after the 1997 indie success of Natalis labyrinth thriller ""Cube"" displays big-budget polish from top to bottom; the exec-producer involvement of splatter maestro Guillermo del Toro should help drum up commercial interest. Sound design from Drens whimpers and hisses to the telltale heartbeats on the soundtrack is highly expressive.
