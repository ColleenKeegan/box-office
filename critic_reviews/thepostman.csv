"The Postman Neither Snow Nor Rain Nor Descent to Anarchy ... December 24 1997 The Postman Neither Snow Nor Rain Nor Descent to Anarchy ... Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Forum Join a Discussion on Movies By STEPHEN HOLDEN very truly awful movie epic has a point of no return a moment when the accumulated bad lines and bogus sentimentality become so cloying that the best defense against a mounting queasiness is an awed amusement. If you have a low tolerance for mawkish jingoism Kevin Costners post-apocalyptic Western ""The Postman"" offers a new opportunity for levity every few minutes after its first hour. There is the moment when a girl too young to have lived before a series of catastrophes destroyed the United States as we know it begins singing ""America the Beautiful"" in a quavery little voice. Theres the moment when a grizzled 68-year-old survivor asked about the tattoo on his arm becomes misty-eyed as he recalls ""a little girl with eyes as wide as saucers in a little town called Saigon."" Or how about Costners solemn christening of a pioneer community ""Elvis Ore.""? In a fable that makes the delivery of mail a metaphor for the rebuilding of civilization there are also impassioned group recitations of the letter carriers oath delivered by teen-agers with the fervor of the Pledge of Allegiance in an American Legion hall. It didnt have to be this way. ""The Postman"" adapted from a novel by David Brin is set in the year 2013 when all that remains of the United States are scattered primitive settlements in the Northwest. This worst-possible scenario of the near future is plausible enough to cause shivers the more you consider it. Costner who produced directed and stars in the movie has tried to turn it into a classic 1950s-style western in which he is the revivified embodiment of that hoary movie archetype the Man With No Name. The outlaws are an army of warriors the Holnists led by the brutal General Bethlehem (Will Patton) who punishes his soldiers for minor infractions of discipline by stringing them up by the heels and slashing their throats. His army terrorizes this feudal pioneer society extorting tribute and forcibly recruiting soldiers. Eventually the nameless hero and the evil general face each other down in a ""High Noon""-like confrontation. (Costners physical resemblance to Gary Cooper is positively eerie in some scenes.) Costners character a shipping clerk in his former life assumes his heroic identity when he discovers a pack of undelivered mail and a postal uniform in a rusted mail truck with a skeleton at the wheel. Donning the outfit he delivers the mail to a nearby settlement and stirs up hope by improvising a credible yarn about being a representative of the newly restored government now based in Minneapolis. Accepted as genuine the Postman quickly becomes a symbol of hope and the guiding force behind a teen-age army of letter carriers who recognize the American flag and begin linking communities with a 21st-century Pony Express. ""The Postman"" knows no restraint. Every scene is played to the hilt for its mythic tear-jerking potential and after a while (the movie runs nearly three hours) the accumulated sentiment begins to curdle. The dialogue a numbing succession of western-movie cliches is spoken with a cartoon-balloon emphasis that makes it seem all the more phony. The Postmans most dedicated disciple a boy who has named himself Ford Lincoln Mercury (Larenz Tate) is such an obnoxiously eager little beaver that you keep hoping hell be disposed of before the movies over. (No such luck.) Costner star that he is comfortably holds the screen exuding an indefatigable decency even as this shamelessly corny ham-fisted movie suggests rampant narcissism below his friendly surface. As a bald-faced exercise in cinematic self-deification ""The Postman"" makes Barbra Streisands ""Mirror Has Two Faces"" seem almost modest.

"Postman The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; postman-the ) Postman The (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli There are two ways that you can look at Kevin Costners The Postman (not to be confused with the former Oscar contender of the same name starring Massimo Troisi). The first is that its a muddled but occasionally-brilliant lampoon of epic motion pictures. The other is that its a horribly written badly acted miscalculation of Ishtar-like proportions. If you take The Postman at face value - that its a straightforward post-apocalyptic adventure tale then it could seem like one of the worst movies of the year if not of all time. However since I laughed so hard during some scenes I prefer to be a little kinder. Yes its a bad movie but its not one of the most unbearable theatrical experiences of the year. In fact if you approach The Postman in the right mood its a highly watchable motion picture. Admittedly thats damning with faint praise but I dont think The Postman is so gut- wrenchingly awful that it deserves less than 2 stars. With all of its rampant jingoism cliched melodrama and shameless attempts at emotional manipulation The Postman could easily be viewed as a clever satire of epic adventures. In fact there are times when it goes so far overboard that I found it virtually impossible to believe that director Kevin Costner wasnt winking at us. Sadly based in part on the films overall tone and in part on some of the directors comments this doesnt seem to be the case. Except in certain moments that are obviously intended to be humorous The Postman is not supposed to be a joke. But intent isnt everything as fans of campy classics will point out. Regardless of what Costner wanted from the movie its still possible to enjoy it on a completely different level. Of course the running length is the real drawback. Its difficult to thrill to the dissonant rhythms of an ""entertainingly bad"" movie that threatens to drag for three hours. At half that length The Postman might have been worth a recommendation but past the two hour mark all of the cheese and corn starts becoming painful. Plus a rather unfortunate attempt to add a message about consequences brings the movie to a grinding halt. We want to see overblown acts of heroism to go along with James Newton Howards grandiose score and Stephen Windons sweeping camerawork. Instead we get a little too much of Kevin Costner brooding. This side of a TV commercial never has the U.S. Mail Service been so lauded (I wonder if they paid a heavy product placement fee). On top of that theres such a cloying dose of patriotism that its a wonder that Warner Brothers has been able to sell the film overseas (of course the foreign markets may view all of the half-baked pro-American slogans as one big joke). From a marketing standpoint the only thing The Postman has going for it is the star and his already-dipping stock is likely to take a precipitous tumble after this movie hits screens across the world. The film opens in 2013 on the Great Salt Flats of Utah. In the aftermath of a cataclysmic world war the human race has been fragmented and scattered. The government of the United States has collapsed and now anarchy reigns. Small communities across the remains of the country jealously protect what they have by offering tribute to the dictatorial General Bethlehem (Will Patton) whose army of bandits and murderers controls everything. Any settlement that defies Bethlehem is quickly razed. One day a solitary wanderer (Costner) enters a small town to present a one-man Shakespeare show as a means of earning a little food and shelter. General Bethlehem pays a surprise visit to this village and the nameless loner is conscripted into the Holnist army. He is a rebellious man however and it isnt long before he escapes. Fleeing from search parties he hides out in an old broken down mail carriers truck. Taking the full letterbag and the coat off a skeleton he becomes the Postman. And as he travels from town-to-town speaking words of hope about the ""Reformed Congress of the United States"" and giving out letters his reputation spreads and Bethlehem determines that hes a threat. Costner has done everything possible to make this film a crowd-pleaser. There are snappy one- liners a romantic subplot for those who crave a little sex and several manipulative scenes that are designed to get audiences to applaud wildly. Unfortunately were too busy laughing at all of the bloated silliness to remember to clap. Take for example one of the films most emotional moments a slow-motion shot of the Postman on horseback snatching a letter out of the hand of an eager boy. The brief sequence is filmed with such solemnity that its all-but-impossible not to be amused however briefly. Costner plays the Postman like a combination of John Dunbar from Dances with Wolves and the mariner from Waterworld. Its not a particularly energetic or interesting performance and its made even more tiresome by the heros reluctance to act decisively (this wastes a good forty-five minutes). As the villain Will Patton is generic. Hes neither good nor bad and doesnt bring much more to the part than wed get from a Dennis Hopper or a Gary Busey. Larenz Tates character Ford Lincoln Mercury is the stereotypical idealistic enthusiast and Tate puts about as much energy into the role as it deserves. The only legitimate spark is generated by newcomer Olivia Williams who plays Abby the Postmans love interest. Shes quite good and manages to develop an independent female character whos not always in need of rescuing but her above-average effort is wasted in this material. Its hard to believe that the same man who directed a modern classic Dances with Wolves could be responsible for something this horribly mishandled. Where did it all go wrong? Probably at the very beginning. The Postman is a bad idea poorly executed. The plot is dumb and riddled with gaping holes of logic and the dialogue sounds like it was penned by a hack writer. (One classic line Abby addressing the Postman says in a heartfelt voice ""You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket."" Puhleeze Give me a break) When all is said and done however at least it can amuse us. And even at an interminable three hours it still offers more solid laughs than half of this years so-called ""comedies.""

Starring Kevin Costner Will Patton Larenz Tate Olivia Williams James Russo Tom Petty. Directed by Costner. (R. 177 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Kevin Costners ""The Postman"" at nearly three hours needs a shot of adrenaline. The dragging pace is one of several agonizing defects in this bloated sci-fi action drama. Though rich in leather-and- horseback action ""The Postman"" has almost none of the exotic tone mystery or fascinating sweep of Costners Oscar-winning ""Dances With Wolves."" Its not emotionally engaging because Costners reluctant post-apocalypse hero seems incongruously laid back considering the odds against him as a man trying to turn his world around. The film based on David Brins 1985 novel wants to be a John Wayne adventure with a rah-rah cavalry crusade but Costner who directed as well as starred cant pull it off. Or make it move. The movie goes on interminably awkwardly mixing a post-holocaust world with a clunky Western staged in pinewood mountains. What emerges is a simplistic melodrama of mushy patriotism stilted romance and hollow morality. Some viewers will no doubt see ""The Postman"" as little more than a puffy vanity project. And ""The Postman"" does suffer from its nearly unrelenting focus on a star who is a bit of a dullard. But to give Costner his due the movie seems an earnest effort with noble intentions. And thanks to the grand scenery its consistently attractive visually. The year is 2013 after a great war has destroyed the United States leaving isolated pockets of people struggling to survive. There are references to plague and fallout. The rural Pacific Northwest is ruled by a brutal militia under the command of self-styled General Bethlehem played fiendishly by Will Patton in the films liveliest performance. A former copy machine salesman Bethlehem oversees a Nazi-like legion in a protection racket extracting food goods and loyalty from the townies. Enter a drifter (Costner) who is passing himself off as a Shakespearean actor. He is conscripted by Bethlehem but escapes his training prison and takes refuge in a long-abandoned U.S. Postal Service truck. Its full of undelivered mail left over from the old days. The setup is intriguing. Wearing a tattered letter carriers uniform and making rounds with a bag of old letters Costner uses his disguise as a way to barter with the townsfolk. He calls himself the Postman and recites stirring words from the letter carriers familiar creed about ""appointed rounds."" The Postman knows hes a fraud and opportunist but the people dont. Its only a matter of several eons of running time before Costner predictably catches hero fever trying to rekindle the peoples memories of a time when a mail carrier was a vital link in community life and by extension in American democracy (as if there were no mail service in non-democracies). His made-up story about a restored U.S. government gives the good folks inspiration to fight Bethlehems cruel domination. ""The Postman"" never gets beyond the most obvious good-versus- evil sentiments. Much of it is mired in flag-waving cliches constantly sapping interest in the early visions of a nation turned upside down. The Postman has a fitful romance with a plucky married woman played by British screen newcomer Olivia Williams who wants him to make her pregnant (her husband goes along with this plan because hes got some virus). And Larenz Tate (""love jones"") plays a courageous townie loyal to the Postman named Ford Lincoln Mercury.

D The Postman Genre Drama Action/Adventure Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Kevin Costner Will Patton Olivia Williams James Russo Peggy Lipton Tom Petty Giovanni Ribisi Larenz Tate; Director Kevin Costner; Author Brian Helgeland Eric Roth; Release Date Wide 12/25/1997; Runtime (in minutes) 177; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 9 1998 -- 1200 AM EST What willful streak of perversity inspired Kevin Costner to take on this wacky tale of a letter carrier-turned-postapocalyptic hero brother to such he-men as Seinfelds Newman and that sad skinny guy in Il Postino? (Answer Hes already done the bodyguard-turned-hero story.) What blinkered sense of movie structure compelled him to drag the outlandish story out over three hours? (Answer two Oscars for Dances With Wolves.) And what extraordinary chutzpah drove him to declare that anyone who isnt moved by his stirring message of hope and patriotism is a jaded cynic--or even worse is influenced by one? (Answer Beats me.) In The Postman Costner plays a drifter who roams the remains of the Pacific Northwest in 2013 after technological destruction has made the place a wasteland as dry as Waterworld was briny. Scrounging for meals by reciting scraps of Shakespeare to people who have forgotten all literature but are experts in knitting Comme des Gareons-style sweaters the fellow stumbles across the uniform and undelivered mail sack of a dead man and thinking the USPS badge of authority will get him food and shelter calls himself The Postman a representative of the United States government. Townspeople swoon. Women throw themselves at him none more ardently than a comely married lass (British actress Olivia Williams) who craves his mailmanliness to make the baby her boyish husband cant. Reluctantly The Postman becomes the galloping symbol of American optimism beating back tyranny (in the person of Will Patton as a fascistic rogue general) inspiring young people to follow in his sack-slinging footsteps and bringing on a joyous era of letter writing not seen since Virginia Woolf sat at her desk. In the end The Postman heals an entire nation so much so that long after he is gone when citizens once again look like mall shoppers instead of knitwear mannequins a heroic statue--of Kevin Costner on a horse--is unveiled in his memory. There are moments in this spectacularly eccentric production--Costners first directing gig since Wolves--when Brian Helgeland and Eric Roths script hints at a welcome self-awareness. (""How much did you pay to come in? So bite me"" the loner challenges a heckler at one of his theatrical performances.) But those moments are about as rare as a day without junk mail. When he turns on the aging-jock charm as he did in Tin Cup Costner is still one of our most attractive American-guy movie stars. But in The Postman he continues his alternative career as one of our oddest movie talents.
