Technically polished but dramatically tepid it might score in the niche market for Christian-themed entertainment. And yet by preaching to the converted so heavy-handedly the filmmakers fumble an opportunity to reach beyond their target demo of devout churchgoers. For those who felt insufficiently uplifted by ""Invincible"" and ""Gridiron Gang"" here comes ""Facing the Giants"" an aggressively inspirational drama about a born-again high school football coach. Financed by the congregation of Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany Ga. pic was made by brothers Alex and Stephen Kendrick the churchs media and teaching pastors and features a cast described in press notes as ""all volunteer."" Technically polished but dramatically tepid it might score in the niche market for Christian-themed entertainment. And yet by preaching to the converted so heavy-handedly the filmmakers fumble an opportunity to reach beyond their target demo of devout churchgoers. Helmer Alex Kendrick cast himself in the central role of Grant Taylor an underpaid and overworked coach whos rightly worried about his employment prospects after six losing seasons at the helm of Shiloh Christian Academys football team. Job insecurity only increases the financial pressures on Grant and his wife Brooke (Shannen Fields) who barely manage to sustain a lifestyle best described as middle-class poverty. Already depressed the coach is driven to the brink of despair by a doctors diagnosis In all likelihood hell never be able to father children. After a long dark night of the soul however Grant finds comfort and inspiration in his Bible. He also gets a quick dose of soulful encouragement from a saintly geezer who wanders through the Shiloh Academy halls blessing the students lockers. Renewed and revitalized Grant announces hes rededicating himself to Christ and redirecting his players to ""honor God"" by playing better. In the pics early scenes the Kendrick brothers do a fine job of vividly conveying the financial and emotional stresses that might beset someone in Grants position. But after the coach decides to let God be his quarterback the scripters run out of things to impede his uplift. Indeed the rest of ""Facing the Giants"" is an unbroken string of triumphs for the born-again coach. With a potent combo of Bible-based preaching and tough-love coaching Grant inspires even his surliest players to accept Jesus Christ as lord and savior -- and while theyre at it stop fumbling so many passes. With God on their side they score a string of victories that is nothing short of miraculous. And as for that infertility diagnosis -- well the Lord works in mysterious ways right? The complete lack of dramatic tension throughout ""Facing the Giants"" makes the thoroughly predictable pic seem much longer than it is. And while most of the performances are appealingly sincere they seldom reach the level of community-theater proficiency. Even University of Georgia football coach Mark Richt is less than totally convincing while playing himself in a fleeting cameo.
