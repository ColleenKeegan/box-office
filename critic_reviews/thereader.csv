Sober intelligence goes only so far in crafting an effective bigscreen version of the international bestseller ""The Reader."" German author Bernhard Schlinks succinct widely admired 1995 novel which parts company with most Holocaust literature by placing a perpetrator not a victim at the storys center uses a late-1950s affair between a former concentration camp guard and a teenager half her age to explore both generations difficulty in coming to terms with German war guilt. Stephen Daldrys film is sensitively realized and dramatically absorbing but comes across as an essentially cerebral experience without gut impact. Classy package will appeal to upscale specialized auds and the bookish set but pic will have trouble crossing over to the general public Stateside. Offshore prospects look stronger. Crisscrossing narrative lines that were laid out chronologically in the novel David Hares astringent screenplay dispenses gradations of accountability across the decades beginning with Nazi functionaries who might well have been just ""doing their jobs"" to members of the ""second generation"" of the postwar period who had to decide how to react to and judge their elders. The intense sexual relationship serves as a simple effective metaphor for the elemental generational link as well as for the shame and uncertainty of how to deal with the fallout. A chance meeting and an act of kindness lead to a first tango in Neustadt between Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) a cold severe but nonetheless attractive woman in her mid-30s who collects tram fares and 15-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross) a bright well-built student who lives with his middle-class family. Transforming with startling but convincing rapidity from an uncertain teen into a cocky young man Michael begins dropping by Hannas flat every day after school for his sentimental education which is illustrated by Daldry judiciously but with plenty of nudity. Title stems from Hannas request that Michael read to her after or preferably before their physical exertions. His selections stick to the classics ""The Odyssey"" ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" and Chekhov for starters. When the ""kid"" as Hanna always calls him launches into ""Lady Chatterleys Lover"" she deems it ""disgusting"" before instructing him to continue reading. Michael takes Hanna on a country outing one day writes a poem about her and is sufficiently smitten to rebuff the attentions of even his most attractive female classmates. But one day Hanna is gone her flat emptied out. Story proper then jumps eight years to 1966 when Michael is a law student under the tutelage of Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz). When their class attends the trial of several middle-aged women who worked as SS guards at concentration camps during the war one of them to Michaels horror is Hanna. Michael tells no one of his personal connection; in fact we have previously heard the older incarnation of Michael (Ralph Fiennes) whos become a lawyer tell his daughter (Hannah Herzsprung) ""Im aware I wasnt always open with you. Im not open with anyone."" As the trial wears on however his fear of revelation begins to tear him up inside as he possesses some information that could help Hannas defense. Thus are the attitudes of younger Germans toward Nazi crimes in which they had no direct involvement held up for scrutiny as part of the necessarily gradual course of processing the truth reconciling the generations and moving ahead as individuals and a nation. Fiennes middle-aged Michael who is seen early on trying to connect with his daughter comes to the fore in the latter stages as the Michael-Hanna drama plays out its final act in an ironic manner that speaks to the potential of rehabilitation and never-too-late education. One of the films best scenes is a sort-of postscript in which Michael goes to New York City to visit a wealthy stylish woman (Lena Olin) who wrote a book with her mother about surviving the camp and the subsequent conflagration where Hanna exercised authority. Interchange between Fiennes and Olin has a snap and electricity missing elsewhere despite dedicated efforts across the board. A central problem with ""The Reader"" as a film is that one can never look inside the character of Hanna. Her life and behavior are invariably assessed from the outside -- what she represents to Michael the way the court and history take stock of her actions -- but never by her. In fact she denies that her own self-evaluation is of any importance. ""It doesnt matter what I feel it doesnt matter what I think"" she insists when asked about wartime atrocities. ""The dead are still dead."" Winslet supplies a haunting shell to this internally decimated woman one who can perhaps momentarily escape from her shame through sex but for whom there is no past she can possibly face and no future to anticipate. She and Kross enact the intimate scenes with impressive delicacy and credible desire and the young German actor who has rounder fleshier features than Fiennes but still manages the match shows confidence and promise (much is made in the press materials about how the production shut down until his 18th birthday before embarking upon the sex scenes). Fiennes deftly invests the grown-up Michael with an emotional limp and the decision to have all the actors speak English with a softly suggestive German accent works pretty well. Supporting cast and locations have been smartly chosen and the modern Germany of the later scenes contrasts sharply with the Old World hangover look of the 50s. Score by Nico Muhly is supple unusual and superbly supportive. Film looks splendid pretty much a given when both Chris Menges and Roger Deakins are credited. Reportedly Deakins prepared the picture and began shooting mostly with the Fiennes material. But when the production halted for a while during the writers strike Deakins moved on to ""Doubt"" and Menges took over as cinematographer when lensing recommenced. The late producing partners Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack receive a special ""in loving memory"" dedication. Another producer Scott Rudin removed his name from the film a couple of months ago due to disputes with Harvey and Bob Weinstein over rushing to finish it before years end.

We reconvene in 1958 and 15-year-old Michael (David Kross) a clever child from an academic family loses his virginity to taciturn Hanna (Kate Winslet) a mysterious 36-year-old trolleybus worker whom he encounters in the street. He falls in love; she enjoys hearing him read from Tolstoy until she disappears one day without warning. Several years later Michael a law student encounters Hanna in a new context - one that reveals devastating facts about his former lover. A new unusual relationship emerges at a distance and one that stretches over many years. To reveal more would damage the debate at the films heart an argument that pitches feelings against facts and necessarily asks more questions than it answers. David Hares unshowy thoughtful screenplay Stephen Daldrys unfussy direction and Roger Deakins and Chris Mengess impressive cinematography are faithful to the detail and tenor of Schlinks novel which is a complex beast in simple clothing. The Reader has been called a Holocaust film but thats not entirely accurate. It would be better tagged a post-Holocaust work as it pitches itself between the known facts of that cataclysm and the unanswerable philosophical questions of its fallout relating to responsibility law justice and forgiveness; all the while considering education and literacy as crucial to those debates. Its dynamic is generational Schlink and Berg are second-generation voices embroiled in first-generation issues addressing a third-generation audience. Its issues are infinite and moveable. Its a bold and challenging work.

I think this is a flawed masterpiece and moral ambiguity isnt one of those flaws- on the contrary that ambiguity is an essential vehicle for examination of the human condition. My only problem I didnt buy the young Micheals sex appeal- it strained the credibility of the already over-emphasized sex scenes. Beyond that the casting was superb; and Winslet hasnt gotten any credit for taking on a politically risky role. Her performance surpasses her already Oscar-worthy one in Revolutionary Road. I found the pacing to be good and all that time- shifting was well handled. For a 2 hour movie it was easy to sit through. But the moral beating this film has taken is completely unwarranted. I thought we had taken a historical step up beginning with ""Hitlers Willing Executioners""; in recognizing the depth of complicity in the Holocaust. Weve spent the last 50 years on individual guilt; we need to recognize that people of ALL stations and stripes were complicit- and that includes sympathetic characters. This film maker lets us discover that for ourselves. Why do we have to be bludgeoned into it? By the end of the film we all feel sorry for Hanna but we also know she deserved her punishment. She was not a Nazi was uneducated and simple with no racial political or ideological axe to grind- but she WAS guilty- period. If we dont recognize that nice ordinary people can do horrific things how can we keep them from happening again? Thats the message I got from the film; but it seems like Im the only oneFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 2 2009cathyFeaturedI could not agree with this review more. ""The Reader"" is idiotic from the very first scene. There are too many things in this story that make no sense to list here. But I will say that the supposed climax of the story - when Michael as a law student decides not tell anyone involved with the trial that Hanna is illiterate - is meaningless. Hanna herself would rather be sentenced to life in prison than admit she cannot read or write - which is stupid enough - but to make this into ""the big moment"" after she has participated in killing hundreds - even thousands - of Jews is laughable.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 30 2009BethFeaturedThe Reader is an offensice joke of a film. Horrible and morally dubious. I completely agree with the Time Out review here. To touch on these subject matters and then skim over the surface of them is to do disservice to the important issues of German guilt and culpability. I thought Stephen Daldry was a better and far more intelligent film maker than that. And its ridiculous that its up for best picture at this years Oscars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 29 2009FatliFeaturedThis is the best film I have watched so far this year.

Anyway you cannot explain love in logical terms if you can it is not true love right? As usual Ralph Fiennes is very good in playing this type of character. Kate Winslet performance is excellent.

The performance of Kross too is also seriously impressively although Fiennes does take some of the edge of the emotions with a performance of sustained somnambulistic tendency.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 22 2009RussellFeaturedIf you like the kind of film that raises questions that dont have easy answers this is probably the film for you quite apart from which its an incredibly brave performance from Winslet that should see her pick up masses of awards its the kind of performance that reminds you just how good an actress she is. .. and helps forgive some of the dross she has been in.

I was blown away while feeling emotionally drained throughout and afterwards. This film built an extreme depth with both characters. i agree that this film does not make any bold moral message it is simple showing the deep affects upon their lives that simple relationships and personalities can have and lets you make your own decisions. Throughout the film I changed my mind of how I felt about Hanna Schmitt... i loved her i despised her and i felt sorry for her. A great portayel of how immaturity and little life experiences can shape your future and how you think. Fantastic scene when Michael met her in prison attempting to see if she had grown and realised what her actions had resulted in to his dissapointment she had not. Fantastic how she was able to keep the power throughout the film even in the end. Thought provoking.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 15 2009KGFeaturedI saw this film last night.

An English-speaking film about Germans has a huge problem from the start. Hannah is supposed to teach herself to read from the texts of books she has heard read to her. The word for ""THE"" is her starting point. But there are I think six different words for THE in the German language. The whole thing is preposterously implausible. Winslet adopts a curious silght German accent but none of the other characters does. No-one could possibly accept that Kroll metamorphoses into Ralph Fiennes in 20 or so years as in the film. And what are we supposed to make of the ""message"" of this film? The use of Auschwitz scenes to convince the audience of the great seriousness and moral purpose of the film I found disgusting and pretentious. Winslet gives a good performance but this alone is not worth the price of the ticket. The thing finally peters out in the slowest most boring end to any film I can remember. DONT BOTHER TO GO.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 14 2009Claire FrancisFeaturedThis is not a nice film. This is not a plot based film its an ideas based film. Its a film which raises more questions than it answers and youll find none of your spoon fed hollywood nonsense here it is full of complex difficult to stomach realities. I wont spoil it for you by discussing particulars but this film left me aghast at its portrayal of the way low-self esteem pride fear and feelings of stupidity can lead to the utter destruction of a person no matter how beautiful they start and induce the cruellest behaviour and irrevocable wrecking of lives and chances. I felt sorry for the main character (in my eyes Winslet) and whats more I felt guilty about it. This is a challenging film and it has stayed with me for nearly a week after seeing it. Winslet has a shaky start but pulls it off magnificently thereafter Fiennes however is wooden and unreadable. The young Michael Berg (David Cross) is one to watch. He plays his role to perfection though his character is very awkward indeed. I gave this film a four because although its thought provoking and well-played it didnt blow my mind and in terms of personal preference even though I will definitely be watching it again I wouldnt rush to buy the dvd.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 14 2009TechnoguyFeaturedI had read the book years ago and couldnt get over a feeling of unsatisfactoriness then.It was a love(first)story yoked to the important subject of the post-war generations reaction to the Holocaust. It read like a finely worked legal document(Shlink had worked as a judge).It showed a perpetrator (Hannah) who had been more implicated by her illiteracy than her evil.She was too ashamed to admit in court that she couldnt read or write.She similarly left 15 year old Michael because of this shame.There is also a 21 year age difference- illicit in our culture-maybe not so in Germany.These are people who are somehow able to connect love-making to reading.She wants to be read to from all the works of literature.I think it was mainly German literature with a smattering of Russian and Greek(certainly not DHL). I must admit to liking Winslets scrubbed performance and David Kross was excellent too.Ralph Fiennes was too wooden but serviceable.The cinematography was excellent(Deakins) and recreated the look and feel of post war Germany. I think the film would have been done better in a German-made film with English subtitles as at times a German actor and English actress seem wrong.It was chiefly about the second generations reaction to the actions of the previous generation and guilt by associationunclesfathersmothers grandparents.Who are all these people that the next generation came from and could the younger generation have done things differently? We also need to remember Gunther Grass revealing late in his life hed been a member of the SS youth.He had already reaped all the honours and only did it when it was safe to do so.Again the film is worthy and better than most others but theres a hollowness at its heart that left me cold. Go and see Fateless and get at the real subject.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 13 2009Valerie LivinaFeaturedYesterday Jupiter moved from the sign of his detriment Capricorn into Aquarius.

It is clearly about a boy who as a man has never got over his first relationship and the fact that it finished abruptly only concentrates this. It is for this reason that he is unable to have long term relationships with other women throughout his life no one can match his earlier feelings. These feelings become incredibly confused when the truth comes out.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The Reader"" opens with a man looking out a window. The year is 1995. The city Berlin. Played by Ralph Fiennes he looks pained and pensive. As the action shifts to the late 50s and to a much younger version of the man we learn why. Director Stephen Daldry knows his way around and through evocative books. In 2002 he did a beautiful job with Michael Cunninghams ""The Hours."" (It is terrific news that he is directing ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier amp; Clay"" Michael Chabons Pulitzer Prize-winning tale of American Jews and comic-book heroes.) Based on German author Bernhard Schlinks best seller ""The Reader"" is a formally simpler yet ethically more perilous affair. After all it tells a story of the Holocaust and its aftermath in one of the most intimate ways possible. What Daldry achieves with ""The Reader"" is a stunning hushed victory. Kate Winslet and German actor David Kross (making an exceptional English-language debut) star as Hanna Schmitz and the young Micheal Berg. When Hanna meets Michael there is little reason to imagine the two will become lovers. He has escaped a train. Head swimming stomach in upheaval the sky pouring. He finds an apartment entryway where he throws up. A woman grabs the 15-year-old cleans him roughly fills pails with water and douses the stone entryway and then the boys shoes. It is the opposite of romantic comedys rule to meet cute. Brought up in a civil learned household once he is well enough the boy is sent to thank the stranger. Their encounter is life-changing. Their lovemaking scenes are lovely but frank. Their nakedness is pronounced in ways that force audiences to ponder nuditys symbolic weight. Their ravenous desire takes a turn when Michael begins reading to Hanna. Winslet is entrancing as Hanna. Her beauty -- harsh a bit defiant or is that defended? -- will indict audiences later. Like Michael our interest -- fondness even -- for her may cause us guilt. Michael is sensitive tentative but he is not a child. Kross performance helps tamp somewhat our discomfort with their ages. Hanna is 21 years older. Scenes with Fiennes frame and punctuate a tale that is a coming of age not just of an adolescent boy but of the second generation of Germans confronting the dark patrimony of the Holocaust. ""The Reader"" captures the intimate and the epic. Using Hanna and Michaels complex intimacy the movie wrestles with the weight of national guilt. Eros and Thanatos get searing close-ups. Michael learns the personal cannot dodge the historical when as a law student he attends a war crimes trial in which Hanna is a defendant. She disappeared from his life ages ago. What could be more soul-rattling than learning that your first love -- the one that defined your relationship to sexual intimacy -- was an SS guard at a concentration camp? It is a fact that Hanna doesnt deny. It is a fact that alters their past and their future. The trials outcome leads us into a third act that continues to give renewed rending meaning to the movies title. David Hares adaptation is spare and eloquent. He gently omits scenes that were lovely to read. They illuminated but they would have crowded the movie with more characters when Michael and Hanna are enough. Well perhaps not quite enough. Bruno Ganz plays the law professor whose students attend the trial. When Michael realizes something about Hanna that might help her defense he takes his quandary to Professor Rohl. A mother and daughter were the only Jewish survivors of the ""death march"" and the ensuing conflagration that are the subject of the trial. Lena Olin portrays the mother in the courtroom scenes. Later she does incisive work as the daughter an author of the survivor memoir. She receives Michael in her New York apartment. Their exchange is not the movies last scene. It is however a fitting reminder of how the story -- hers and her mothers Michael and Hannas -- never stops revealing its jarring meanings its countless sorrows. ""The Reader"" R for some scenes of sexuality and nudity. 2 hour 3 minutes. Directed by Stephen Daldry; written by David Hare; from the book by Bernhard Schlink; photography Chris Menges and Roger Deakins; starring Kate Winslet David Kross Ralph Fiennes Bruno Ganz Leno Olin.

In this image David Kross right and Kate Winslet are shown in a scene from ""The Reader."" Photo AP/The Weinstein Co. Melinda Sue Gordon. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald The Reader may not arrive at a definitive answer to its central dilemma -- how does a generation absolve itself of the sins of its fathers? -- but the truth is that there is no satisfactory answer. At least The Reader is savvy enough to ask the question. But the film based on the bestselling novel by Germanys Bernhard Schlink relies too much on coincidence and in an even more puzzling turn seems to suggest that illiteracy might be a valid excuse for the worst of human behavior. Set in Germany the film travels back through the memory of lawyer Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) who as a teenage boy in 1958 threw himself into a tempestuous affair with Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) a strange older woman. Young Michael (played by German actor David Kross pretty enough to convince us hell grow up to be Fiennes) is quickly and eagerly obsessed; Hanna is distant one moment seductive the next then suddenly infuriated for reasons the inexperienced Michael cant fathom. Hes heartbroken when the inevitable occurs and Hanna vanishes. Fate however is not finished with Michael. Years later a law school field trip lands him in a courtroom -- of all the trials in all the towns in all the world -- where he is shocked to see Hanna as the primary defendant in a war-crime trial. The Reader is visually arresting particularly during the early scenes of Michael and Hannas affair which glow with a golden light that mimics Michaels youthful idealism. Theyre the best part of the movie full of tension and possibility. But as the film drifts back to the adult Michael it grows more pedestrian and the weight of Hannas secret becomes more a clumsy plot device than a reason for her unthinkable behavior. The performances are uniformly good especially Kross who bears the heavy (or is it fortunate?) burden of full-on frontal nudity in his sensual explicit scenes with Winslet. But The Reader doesnt do enough to explore the guilt and betrayal the adult Michael feels over the acts of his elders. Weve seen plenty of Holocaust movies but The Reader is one of the few to deal with the subject of how the next generation of Germans makes sense of such carnage. If only it hadnt offered such a lightweight excuse for the darkness of the human soul. Cast Kate Winslet Ralph Fiennes David Kross Director Stephen Daldry Screenwriter David Hare.

If not for them as well as an impressive performance by virtual newcomer David Kross there would be nothing positive to say about it at all. Editors Note Spoilers Ahead The story starts in Berlin 1958 when young Michael Berg (Kross playing 15 years old in these scenes) is seduced by a much older streetcar-conductor named Hanna (Winslet). Hes quickly reduced to a lovesick slave trading readings of great books for rolls in the sack. The two actors spend the first third of the movie mostly naked. Not just kind of naked. Naked naked. Anyway after an exciting couple of months Michael finds her apartment empty. Not even a note has been left. Years later and now in law school Michael is still waiting for the wounds from his affair with Hanna to turn into bearable scars when his class is invited to observe a war-crimes trial. Several female concentration camp guards have been accused of murder after the publication of a survivors memoir and one of them turns out to be Hanna. This is what made Bernhard Schlinks bestseller from which The Reader is adapted so powerful; his book is a stirring meditation on Germanys post-war conscience as generations find some way to live with and grow out of the Nazi atrocities. Michael a member of the first generation to become teenagers and then adults after the war must contend with the complex emotions that come with not only rediscovering his first love but also discovering that his first love was responsible for hundreds maybe even thousands of deaths. Hanna is an intriguing character since she reveals nothing of who she really is and yet thanks to Winslet fully exists onscreen. She is a force that destroys lives while trying to find some semblance of happiness for herself. Does she feel guilt over what she did in those camps? Did she understand what she was doing when she showed her prisoners to the gas chambers? Did she ever love Michael or was his just another existence to decimate? Now youre probably wondering at this point what the hell is so bad about this movie? This critic guy seems to think it has a lot going for it right? Well thats true. The Reader does have a lot going for it intellectually that is (the book got it right; the movie doesnt). Its execution however is a travesty -- cold and unfeeling -- the self-important direction by Stephen Daldry (The Hours) assumes profundity because of the subject matter but never offers up a hint of humanity outside of brief moments in Krosss performance of university-aged Michael and a painful exchange between Fienness Michael and the author of the memoir that helped to condemn Hanna. Its intellectual snobbery without any soul.

When you catch one at the right place and time before it breaks you ride it propelled by its force until it deposits you at the shoreline. But when you dont quite catch it you scramble and splash scraping yourself on ocean bottom as you fight it. I had both experiences at The Reader Stephen Daldrys cool and detached account of the hot and intimate affair between a mature woman and a secondary-school student in Germany circa 1955 a brief tryst with repercussions down the decades. It is based on the semiautobiographical book (and Oprah book-club pick) by Bernhard Schlink about the effects of the Holocaust on the generation of Germans that came of age in the 1950s. For the screen the novel has been padded and plumped not always successfully by playwright David Hare. With this film Daldry previously the director of Billy Elliot and The Hours proves himself the screens reigning master at showing passion thwarted or repressed this time to a propulsive Philip Glass-lite score from Nico Muhly. In The Reader the narrative flashes forward and back among the 1950s 1960s and 1990s. In the 1990s segments Ralph Fiennes is a German lawyer Michael Berg who lives in an apartment so pristine that it might be occupied by one who wears gloves so as to leave no fingerprints. Why does Fiennes one of the most compelling actors of his generation so often play Our Man of Perpetual Sorrows a figure whose alabaster face is frozen in anguish an expression that might be confused with constipation? As I pondered the question - while resisting The Reader - the movie flashed back to the 1950s as the much more expressive teenage Michael Berg (David Kross) walks the street of a mid-size German city clutching his stomach retching near the entrance of an apartment block. At this moment Hanna (Kate Winslet) a tenant in the building approaches efficiently disposes of the vomit and orders Michael to her apartment where she washes his soiled clothes as he huddles naked in the bath. Months later when Michael comes to thank Hanna for her kindness woman and manchild become enmeshed in an affair that takes both by surprise. Hannas preferred foreplay is that Michael read to her and he does - Homer Mark Twain and D.H. Lawrence inflame their ardor. At such times I stopped resisting The Reader and just went with the naked emotions bodies and literature - all eloquent. While the sex is mostly implied I came to know Winslets and Kross bodies as well as I know my husbands. Their affair which lasts a summer ends as abruptly as it begins. Hanna vanishes. And the next time Michael sees her it is in the 1960s. He is a law student exploring legal ethics; she is a defendant accused of sending hundreds to their deaths when she worked as a concentration camp guard in Nazi Germany. Thus their erotic enmeshment becomes a moral one Michael is guilty that he didnt know who Hanna was and what she may have done. When he hears her testimony he feels guilty about withholding a secret that might lessen the severity of Hannas sentence. During this sequence - roughly at films midpoint - I committed to Hanna and Michael and to wherever their tides and undercurrents carried me. Daldry and Hare aim to make a film about how Nazism casts its long shadow on the 20th century. In that light The Reader is not particularly pointed. Yet as a story of an enmeshment not easily untangled a story of two lost souls who find each other I was deeply moved. Especially by Winslet and Kross - and in the end by Fiennes.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Late into ""The Reader"" the movies young German protagonist Michael Berg (David Kross) visits Auschwitz concentration camp well after the end of WWII. The camera surveys the dreary landscape and finds several giant cages of shoes. Its a scene as superfluous as the movie itself is irksome. What does Michael hope to discover on this trip? What do the filmmakers? After a sensuous introductory act ""The Reader"" descends into a series of dismaying contradictions regarding the moral toxins of the Holocaust - which still pollute postwar Germany.Stephen Daldry directed ""The Reader"" from a script David Hare adapted from Bernhard Schlinks 1995 novel and theyve swapped moral purpose for the artsy tastefulness that made their collaboration on ""The Hours"" such an attractive wallow. But using handsome camerawork good editing and one of Philip Glasss designer scores to illuminate the inner lives of a bunch of unhappy women is one thing. ""The Reader"" is a bigger gamble It leaves the Holocaust at the feet of a generation born just as it was ending. Michael is innocent of his countrys crimes. But a kind of guilt stains him nonetheless.He takes that trip to Auschwitz in the 1960s with a lot on his mind. (Forget that the movie makes it look like a hop and a skip from Germany.) Michael has just discovered that the older woman with whom he once enjoyed an intense summer fling a streetcar fare-taker named Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) is on trial for war crimes. Hanna was a Nazi prison guard during the war and the centerpiece of her dirty work involved standing by with five other women while a church crammed with 300 Jews burned to nothing. Years later Michael is a law student in a course taught by Bruno Ganz on German guilt and as part of the curriculum he must endure watching his former lovers trial. That he spent all those weeks blissfully unaware of Hannas past while he read great literature to her makes him one of her victims too.Forget whether the survivors of her crimes can bring themselves to forgive her. Can Michael? ""The Reader"" pivots between Krosss thoughtful performance as the younger man and the characters older self played by Ralph Fiennes and the movie is about his reconciliation. The filmmakers might not want us to think of Michael as someone who also survived Hanna but watching this man vacillate between shame nostalgia and anger that thought crossed my mind.Winslet meanwhile suffuses this part with great integrity (and so little German accent) but the film shields her from the horrors of her characters transgressions. Its not a shock to see Winslet in a role like this. There is almost nothing she cant act her way through. But her movie star elegance presents a smoke screen for the characters morality. It feels like a sin not to like her.So much of a movie is driven by images. What we dont see can often be as powerful as what we do. And what we dont see in ""The Reader"" - the feet that walked in all those caged shoes say - constitutes a vulgarity of omission. Hearing about Hannas crimes is not quite the same as watching her commit them. That the criminal in this instance is Winslet demands more than hearsay to convey that this lovely woman could be the perpetrator of any atrocity greater than that Nancy Meyers movie ""The Holiday."" The filmmakers are comfortable showing Hannas sexual nudity when really we need proof of her moral nakedness. Otherwise what were told radically alters the meaning of what we see. Now its ""The Sorrow and the Pretty.""This of course is a matter both of taste and tastefulness. The trial acknowledges that the Holocaust was heinous while keeping intact the essential purity of its star. ""The Reader"" goes even further in building what amounts to a consecration of a war criminal sentimentalizing the unsentimentalizable. The trials outcome hinges on whether Hanna can read. And here the film stages its most galling moral idea - that the shame of possible illiteracy might outweigh the crime of mass murder.After weve spent so many scenes watching a repentant old Hanna educate herself with her ex-lovers help the movie tries a last-minute effort to put its sentimentality in perspective. Michael pays a beseeching visit to one of Hannas survivors (a cuttingly good Lena Olin) who tells him that the Holocaust was not therapy despite all evidence here to the contrary. Hanna may be full of apology. But its unseemly to plead for an audience to accept it.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Are some crimes so beyond comprehension that there are no mitigating circumstances? Those questions are at the heart of The Reader; their existence its biggest problem. The acting particularly by an outstanding Kate Winslet is at times inspired. But the relentlessly downbeat nature of the film along with the prospect of feeling sorry for a woman who worked as a Nazi guard and was at least partly responsible for the deaths of hundreds is a bit much to ask. Winslet plays Hanna Schmitz a streetcar ticket-taker who happens upon a boy retching in an alley during a rainstorm. That boy is Michael Berg whom we will come to know at various stages of his life. The young Berg is played by David Kross; Ralph Fiennes plays him as an adult. This chance meeting will lead to a passionate affair between Hanna and Michael one that includes not just copious amounts of sex but intellectual stimulation. Hanna likes to be read to and requires it of Michael almost as a ticket of admission to her bed. They grow close but Hanna is moody flying into rages. Michael is being kept from friends his age and when Hanna is offered a promotion she suddenly disappears. We next see Michael in law school where his professor (Bruno Ganz) takes his students to the trial of women charged with war crimes - Hanna is among them. She was a guard at Auschwitz and is being tried for murder in the deaths of hundreds of prisoners. Michael is of course flooded with memories (director Stephen Daldry plays with time throughout) and struggles with his emotions. Hanna has a secret one that Michael realizes over the course of the trial. It doesnt absolve her of guilt but it would affect her punishment if she would reveal it. The adult Michael remains morally confused distant still grappling with his feelings about Hanna. Fiennes is as always quite good but this part of the film is sterile cold. Only a late scene in which Michael meets with the daughter of a survivor (a quietly ferocious Lena Olin) feels truly alive and is all the more welcome because of it. Kross is good in a tricky role. Winslet is outstanding particularly given that Hanna is such an unsympathetic character. We never quite feel sympathy toward her and its testament to Winslets skill and confidence that she never really asks us to.

"Movie review The Reader -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Reader -- 4 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic In some stories there can be no catharsis the German writer Bernhard Schlink O has said of his novel The Reader. For some crimes there is no forgiveness.The Reader brought to the screen by Stephen Daldry with a script by David Hare seconds that. In taking Schlinks story of the ultimate ""generation gap"" the misunderstanding between post- World War II Germans and the parents and others who allowed or participated in the most monstrous acts in history theyve reached for something almost unique to Holocaust stories -- an understanding of the perpetrators of degrees of guilt and the absolution that no person who lived through that era could possibly feel he or she deserves. The Reader begins as a Summer of 42 romance an inappropriate affair between a 15-year-old boy (David Kross) and a thirtysomething trolley conductor in 1958 Germany. Since that conductor Hanna is played by Kate Winslet we instantly question why someone who looks like her is single why shes living the life she is why this transgressive sex (explicitly shown) appeals to her.The boy Michael falls for Hanna and finds a way into her heart. She loves hearing him read -- The Odyssey books of poetry novels school assignments. The affair is doomed of course. But years later just when the sophistication and sexual experience she gave him should be paying off Michael loses even the sweet memories of that past. He is in law school. Its 1966 his teacher ( Bruno Ganz perfect) takes his class to one of the last big war-crimes trials. And there is Hanna in the dock. The film shifts the timeline of the events in the novel but that actually aids Schlinks subtext -- that generation gap in understanding. Michael was born in 1943 Hanna in 1922. What did she do during the war? What crime could she his first love have possibly committed? How will he react?The Reader is framed within an extended flashback from 1995. The adult Michael ( Ralph Fiennes) is remembering for his adult daughter the affair that so touched and scarred him for life the events that picked up his story with Hanna in 1958 1966 1988 and 1995. Fiennes gives Michael an emotional emptiness that psychologists say is often a consequence of borderline abusive sexual relationships. That gives the film Schlinks desired effect -- a kind of frustration that comes from trying to grasp the unfathomable and failing. The emotional release so wrenching and so common to victim-centered Holocaust dramas is missing.Then you see Winslet conveying everything we need to know about this woman in her eyes the set of her mouth. Theres confusion grief guilt and shame in that face. She betrays the way Hannas emotions might have been shut down to keep from going mad and the return of those emotions. Winslet will absolutely break your heart.It may not be an emotional or intellectually satisfying Holocaust tragedy. Daldry robs the story of a couple of its most telling blows. But The Reader distant though it can be touches and provokes a mulling over of the Holocaust like few films on the subject in recent memory.

(Photo K. C. Bailey/Courtesy of IFC Films ) This is a case where an actor makes the difference. Mickey Rourke was once among our most charismatic leading men alert wittily self-contained (he always seemed to be smiling at a private joke) with a high but seductive voice. Whatever the hell he did to himself it worked for Sin City in which the makeup for his monster-man avenger Marv brought out the freakish poetry in his distended physiognomy. In The Wrestler his face has that poetry without the makeup. Rourke has long blond hair that makes him look like a battered lion and his tight swollen mask makes Randys struggle to bare his soul even more momentous. Its dumb its outlandish but smashing other peoples heads and getting his own smashed back really does complete him. Revolutionary Road Directed by Sam Mendes. Paramount Vantage. R.

Che which runs about four and a half hours chronicles the two big revolutionary battles in the life of Che Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) Part One is Cuba (cigars for everybody) Part Two Bolivia (last cigars for everybody). As movie directors go Steven Soderbergh is an intellectual which means that when he has a brainy conception for a film he has a hard time letting it goor ringing variations on it testing it. His notion here is to show you temporally tactilely how grueling it is to slog through a jungle and violently overthrow an unjust government; for Che it was even harder because (a) he had terrible asthma and (b) he insisted on toting books with him to teach his soldiers (who had to be literate) about the historic struggles of the proletariat. Che is an impressive physical feat but especially in the second part which gives you day after day of rebels being killed and indigenous poor people not joining the good fight you start to look forward to Che getting riddled by bullets. The whole movie is a forced march. In The Reader Kate Winslet plays Hanna Schmitz a glum buttoned-down German with a dark secret which we know has significance because the protagonist Michael (David Kross when young Ralph Fiennes when middle-aged) has a teacher who lectures The notion of secrecy is central to Western literature. The Reader comes with its own readers guide. Michael loses his virginity to Hanna anyway although he should probably have guessed that it wouldnt end well when in the course of peeling off her stockings she gives him a hard stare and asks Haff you always been weak? Nazi ideals die hard. Michaels face signals hurt there are sad piano chords he turns away then Hannas face reveals that she knows she has been cruel. The director Stephen Daldry has radar for the obvious which he imparts to his actors. Hanna insists that Michael read to her before their couplings but the pall is so heavy that neither the reading nor the sex looks like much fun. In the movies second half Michael tries to understand how not-bad people can do very bad things and whether learning to read can make a difference. It appears that the filmmakers have taken Hannah Arendts notion of the banality of evil way too literally. John Leguizamo gives his truest performance on film as a failed boxer in Salvatore Stabiles emotional roller-coaster Where God Left His Shoes. Axed from the card of an upcoming bout he loses his apartment and goes with his wife (Leonor Varela) and two children (David Castro Samantha Rose) into a homeless shelter. The film follows his frantic efforts to get them out of there by Christmas which involves fast-talking and then pleading with housing directors and a series of potential employers while his belittled son traipses around the city after him. The acting the on-the-fly atmosphere (the film was shot quickly) and Leguizamos increasingly urgent hustle are deeply evocative but parts of the movie are almost too painful to endure. Like The Pursuit of Happynessbut with a vastly different endingthe film taps into the primal fear of not being able to protect ones family from the cruelty of the world. Given these times its almost too big a doseit gives your bad dreams bad dreams. E-mail filmcriticnewyorkmag.com. Previous 1 2 3 4 5 Share this story...

Review The Reader Bernhard Schlinks bestselling novel ""The Reader"" is about how the German generation born after the Holocaust coped with its legacy of guilt. The movie adaptation by screenwriter David Hare and director Stephen Daldry starts out choppy and overdrawn but develops a cumulative power. Its about a 15-year-old boy Michael (David Kross) who in 1958 has a passionate affair with Hanna (an uneven Kate Winslet) a working-class woman 20 years his senior. Eight years later while a law student observing the Nazi war crimes trials Michael - played as an adult by Ralph Fiennes - is shocked to discover that Hanna whom he had lost track of is in the dock admitting her role as a guard at Auschwitz. The emotional core of ""The Reader"" is how Michael copes with this fact. His emotional transformation is not easily rendered on film but Fiennes knows how to do nuance. He brings to the role a shimmering subtlety. Grade B (Rated R for some scenes of sexuality and nudity.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test?

The documentary film was written and directed by Clay Tweel. Photo Open Road Films By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 30 2016 155 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS The subject of Clay Tweels superb documentary feature is Steve Gleason the former New Orleans Saints safety who was diagnosed with ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease in 2011. Shortly afterward Mr. Gleason started chronicling the progress of his disease in a video diary but six weeks later he and his wife Michel learned she was pregnant. At that point the diary became for the most part a series of straight-to-the-camera messages to his son Rivers both before and after the birth. ""My intention"" he says at the outset when his speech is still unimpaired ""is to pass on as much of who I am as I possibly can to you."" What was meant as a gift to his son is a gift to anyone who watches the film which incorporates Mr. Gleasons home videos in a profile of almost unfathomable courage--hes still very much with us although his body has been ravaged by the disease--and a portrait of a profoundly good man. ENLARGE Michel Gleason Steve Gleason and Rivers Gleason. Photo Open Road Films ""Gleason"" is so powerful in its cumulative effect that it should be accompanied by a consumer advisory--something along the lines of ""This documentary may cause sudden alterations of mood and attitude."" I can attest to having been undone by at least one scene and Im far from an easy weeper; its a confrontation between Mr. Gleason and his own father a man with rigid notions of good and evil. The moment is at once heart-rending and transcendently beautiful and father-and-son themes play in parallel throughout the film or perhaps they intertwine in a double helix. Mr. Gleason is determined to be a better father for his son than his father was for him even though he must speak through a voice synthesizer by the time Rivers is starting to talk. More Reviews Jason Bourne Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The film is authentically inspiring but also unsparing in its depiction of the horrors of ALS and its impact on the family. (The implacable strength of Michel Gleason could be the subject of a separate film.) The disease moves swiftly attacking Steve Gleasons spirit as well as his body. There are times captured by the unblinking camera when his agonies seem unendurable yet he has rejected assisted suicide and chosen to live out a life that brings joy with the pain. In one conjunction of more emotions than can be put into words we see him struggling to breathe while he watches Rivers struggling to blow out all four candles on his birthday cake.

"The Reader Search for meaning between the covers | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Reader Search for meaning between the coversLike a good book with missing pages The Reader seems stripped of essential meaning.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 12 2008 The Reader (out of 4)Starring Kate Winslet Ralph Fiennes and David Kross. Directed by Stephen Daldry. 120 minutes. At the Cumberland. 14A Like a good book with missing pages The Reader seems stripped of essential meaning.Many of the elements are there for the awards-season contender the movie has so clearly been crafted as with impeccable acting and faultless cinematography chief amongst its virtues. Yet the Holocaust-themed story which director Stephen Daldry and writer David Hare have adapted from the bestseller by German author Bernhard Schlink has lost depth and emotion in the transition to the screen.Moments that resonate so strongly in print - the illicit sex and the pre-coital book readings - seem almost tawdry or trite. Its hard not to laugh at lines like this ""Read to me first kid. Then we make love."" Its also uncomfortable watching what amounts to statutory rape an older woman seducing a young teenager which would likely result in the film being banned if the genders were reversed.Other scenes fail to make the full impact required of them including the pivotal courtroom confrontations. They dissolve into accusations and cross-examining without the dramatic re-enactment that might have given the film so much more weight. Reports that The Reader was rushed into release for awards contention against the directors wishes seem borne out by the choppy editing and uneven pace.Daldry and Hare last teamed for The Hours in 2002 and they were able to juggle multiple narratives with considerably more flair than theyve managed with what is essentially just a single story here.These structural deficiencies are almost overcome by superlative acting particularly by Kate Winslet who is fast becoming Meryl Streeps equal for talent and versatility.Winslet almost disappears behind the dowdy attire and grim demeanour of Hanna a woman we first meet at age 35 in the Germany of 1958 as she seduces 15-year-old Michael (newcomer David Kross looking like a young Heath Ledger).Hanna is more comfortable showing her naked form than she is sharing her naked thoughts.Michael learns almost nothing about her during his summer-long dalliance and doesnt see her again until a dozen years later when she turns up in a courtroom charged with a horrific crime. Michael must decide if the woman who gave so freely of herself in his teen years is worthy of generosity and forgiveness in return.The story is presented mainly in flashback bookended by an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) musing about his past and coming to grips with the effect it has had on his current life. The Reader is meant to be a highbrow production that courts Oscar voters with the quality of its elements and the profundity of its message of reconciliation.The quality is there but the message has already been imparted to much greater effect in similar films like Music Box and Apt Pupil.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Stephen Daldrys film written by David Hare is faithful both to the novels plot and to its higher aspirations. This is not an entirely good thing. On the other hand -- and somewhat surprisingly -- it is not an entirely bad thing. Even if you have not read the book youre probably familiar with the plot. A 15-year-old lad named Michael Berg (David Kross giving a splendidly modulated performance of teen angst sexuality and intellectual aspiration) falls ill in the entrance of an apartment building in 1950s Germany. He is rescued by an attractive working-class woman named Hanna (Kate Winslet in a performance that heartbreakingly combines passivity and anger) who arranges his return home. When he comes back to thank her for her aid they embark upon a heated sexual relationship which in due course she abruptly breaks off. Some years later as a law student he visits a courtroom where he finds her on trial as a war criminal which shocks him beyond measure. He also -- quite belatedly -- discovers that she is illiterate and that her shame at that condition probably in some way that is not clear to us (or her) contributed to her wartime depredations against Jewish women she was transporting on a death march. Still later (and now played by Ralph Fiennes) Michael supplies her with the books she painfully learns to read during her imprisonment though he otherwise keeps her at a wary distance. Eventually she comes to a sad and not entirely predictable ending. (See the top 10 movie performances of 2008 including Winslet as Hanna.) You do not need a Ph.D. in comparative literature to understand that Hannas illiteracy symbolizes the willed ignorance of the German people about the genocide that was going on around them during World War II. Historically speaking Germany was among the most literate nations and also one of the most morally conscientious ones -- which is why Schlinks illiteracy conceit works so well. If you can read -- whether it be a book or highly visible mass behavior -- yet refuse to do so then what might in another context be dismissed as no more than backwoods ignorance is transformed into a vast and palpable moral crime. Im not certain that Schlinks novel or this film makes that connection explicit. Both have obligations to melodramatic plotting and characterization that to a degree blur the inherent point of the exercise. In the end Hannas defense of her crime -- she allowed most of her prisoners to die in a fire in a church (hard to imagine a more obvious choice of crime scene) -- comes down to well yes what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil. I dont deny the validity of Arendts subtle brutal reading of what is surely the most terrible event in a modern history that continues to be rife with such horror. But it is an idea that has lost much of its power to arrest our attention in fictional narrative. In some of the early Internet commentaries on this film people natter on about the effect on the boy of having sex with an older presumably exploitative woman -- as if thats the big moral issue being explored here. Well it didnt bother Oprah who selected The Reader for her book club and it doesnt bother me. At 15 boys are supposed to be having sex -- or at least trying to have it. And I dont see how it is necessarily more scarring to have it with an experienced older woman than it is to have awkward fumbling encounters with someone just as innocent as you are. Yes Fiennes older Michael is an emotionally distant even chilly figure. But it does not necessarily follow that that is a result of his adolescent sexual encounters. In a curious way though much of this is superfluous to the movie as a movie. The story dares to hint at a certain smugness in the attitudes of its victims which is something we are not at all used to in movies of this kind. And as a romance at times feverish and at other times grim the film works surprisingly well. Theres something gripping about the relationship between this ill-assorted pair and something touching about the way events beyond their control or understanding reach out to blight their lives.

Melinda Sue Gordon)  NO SALES  Photo Melinda Sue Gordon AP Movie review The Reader 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The Reader Drama. Starring Kate Winslet David Kross and Ralph Fiennes. Directed by Stephen Daldry. (R. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Life sometimes has a way of starting out passionately and trailing off into vagueness but movies are supposed to correct that not imitate it. In the case of ""The Reader"" we have a film made with high aspirations and more than the usual commitment but one that after an arresting beginning changes into a passive rumination. Picture Ralph Fiennes looking quietly disconsolate - get that picture in mind - and youll have conceived the entire essence of this movies last 40 minutes. Throughout ""The Reader"" has atmosphere a beaten-down Central European gloom of long winters overcast skies and an accompanying sense of malaise. But as the movie begins the late-afternoon twilight seems to hide a quality of mystery even sexual possibility A teenage boy (David Kross) is suddenly taken ill on a German street. A woman in her 30s (Kate Winslet) very curt and matter-of-fact sees that hes taken care of and when the young fellow recovers months later he shows up at her apartment to thank her. In that funny way things sometimes happen the notion of the two ending up in bed passes seamlessly from unthinkable to inevitable. The audiences watches not sure how to feel about this. In one way everybody is happy. He gets his initiation into the fun and frolic of adulthood and she gets her first lover in years. Yet theres something bleak about the situation that derives not just from the dimness and squalor of the womans apartment but also from the woman herself whose soul seems to be expressed by these surroundings. Clearly something is wrong here. This woman is scarred in some way. She has seen something or done something or has been the victim of something and sex is only a temporary relief from the psychological pain. Or maybe its something else a way of cutting through the psychological numbness that encases her. When theyre not in bed she tries to keep things at a distance. She calls him ""kid"" and tries not to open up. But its a struggle and Winslet is no surprise beautiful at conveying all aspects of this the womans strength and calculation her growing affection and need her despair and self-disgust. At this point it should be mentioned that every advance piece every blurb and every description Ive read concerning ""The Reader"" has given away the answer to the question that haunts the movies first 40 minutes What is this womans story? Still on the off chance that there are a few readers left who dont know the answer I wont reveal it here. ""The Reader"" takes place over the course of decades. Fiennes plays the boy as a grown man who sits remembering the womans story always with that forlorn-lizard look on his face that lets you know that this cannot end happily. The film takes the young fellow (still played by Kross) through his career in law school then shows him as an adult (Fiennes) grappling with problems of intimacy and confessing to loved ones things like ""I wasnt always open with you. Im not open with anyone."" Implicit in the last two-thirds of ""The Reader"" is the understanding that the boy was somehow permanently damaged by his early intimacy with this woman. But however crass this sounds if they wanted to convey this concept of permanent scarring they really should have cast a woman less appealing than Winslet. For myself I didnt know any Kate Winslet look-alikes when I was 15 but if I did I doubt Id be sitting around decades later all downcast and lizard-faced. Id probably still be bragging about it. This is not to deny that ""The Reader"" based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink touches on issues that are monumental - crime guilt complicity conscience. Such subjects carry with them intrinsic interest and they buy the film considerable indulgence. But in the end these grand subjects are simply not integrated into the relationship between the woman and the man. That unlikely couple is the movies subject and their interaction is the movies story its source of drama. When that source dries up the movie degenerates into an intellectual exercise without suspense or revelation. To the end the direction of Stephen Daldry (""The Hours"") remains intelligent and graceful. But its a measure of the storys ultimate barrenness that Daldry must reach for symbols in an attempt at significance. Early in the film the woman asks the boy to read to her and this becomes a ritual for them. Later in the absence of any narrative urgency this idea of the boy (and now the man) being a reader becomes important - and yet not really. Everything really important can be found on the edges of this story not within it. -- Advisory Strong language nudity disturbing conversations.

"The Reader reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Reader reviewed. The Reader reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 11 2008 515 PM Must Love Nazis Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet find doomed romance in The Reader. By Dana Stevens Kate Winslet in The Reader The Reader (the Weinstein Co.) is slow-acting poison. For the first third of the movie youll experience a not-unpleasant tingling in the extremities giving way to an encroaching torpor. An hour in your pupils will have shrunk to pinholes and by the time the closing credits roll youll be capable only of a dim longing for the defibrillation paddles. Who would have thought a movie about a beautiful frequently naked female Nazi could be so dull? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. If anyone could pull off the feat of making nude Nazis boring it would be Stephen Daldry whose The Hours (2002) was a genteel portentous literary adaptation of exactly this sort. The Reader is based on a German best-seller by Bernhard Schlink a former Oprah selection that is by all accounts a harrowing look into Germanys troubled postwar conscience. The movie is something else a titillating romance that suddenly morphs into a suspense-free courtroom drama then trickles off in a wan coda of hand-wringing. Advertisement Middle-aged law professor Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) is a lonely shell of a man incapable of real connection; as we first meet him hes politely dismissing a one-night stand. Glancing at a passing streetcar hes reminded of a certain summer long ago. Unfortunately instead of hearing the theme from Summer of 42 we then flash back to 1958 when the teenage Michael (played by the gawky endearing David Kross) had a furtive love affair with the much older Hanna Schmitz (Winslet) a ticket-taker on the Berlin trolley. Hanna is an odd sort of girlfriend fiercely sexual but briskly unromantic given to sudden bouts of cruelty and sorrow. The sheltered middle-class Michael is thoroughly entranced by this passionate enigma. He cuts school to spend days at her apartment reading the classics aloud to her in bed. (These early scenes in which literature and lust converge are the movies best.) Then one day he finds Hannas apartment empty. Years later Michael still waiting to turn into Ralph Fiennes enters law school. His professor (Bruno Ganz) takes the class to observe a war-crimes trial in which a group of former SS guards are accused of letting Jewish prisoners burn to death in a locked church. The principal defendant Hanna Schmitz. Devastated Michael returns to his class Adolescent Grandstanding 101 to debate the morality of trying war criminals 20 years after the fact. Was Hanna as she insists a terrified subordinate carrying out orders or was she a sadistic ringleader enjoying her power? Maybe Im lacking in moral complexity (or maybe this is a uniquely German story that translates poorly to an American context) but The Readers central problem (which seems reducible to ""I shagged a Nazi"") strikes me as a bogus one. If Michael can say truthfully that he knew nothing about his lovers past doesnt that effectively absolve him of guilt? A lifetime of Fiennes-ian brooding seems a steep price to pay for one summer of unwitting fascistic congress. And even if Michael cant help but feel haunted by his fling shouldnt others (like the Holocaust survivor he confronts near the end of the film played by Lena Olin) let him off the hook? Why on earth should a horny teenage boy have to abstain from sex with a willing blond goddess on the off chance she might be SS? For Kate Winslet is indeed a goddess one whose special power is to descend among us in manifold human forms. Even in this hopelessly silly role--half dominatrix half victim devoid of legible motivation--she finds moments of truth. (On a bike excursion with Michael you can see Hanna trying and failing to rediscover her carefree prewar self.) Yes Kate is grubbing for an Oscar this year with the near-simultaneous release of two Important Dramas (this and Revolutionary Road). But she may be the finest actress of her generation and (unlike her only real competitor the other Cate) shes also a five-time nominee whos never won. I say give her the gold guy already Academy if it means so much to her. Maybe it will free her up to stop acting in movies like this.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Like Doubt Stephen Daldrys The Reader is low-budget high-profile and beamed straight at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Category of High Moral Tone. Only in this case the stakes are way higher and the attitude muted to a fault. Based on a partly autobiographical novel by Bernhard Schlink The Reader examines German culpability for the Holocaust through the story of a love affair between a 15-year-old boy and a woman more than twice his age who later turns out to have been a tiny cog in the wheel of the Third Reich. In 1995 when the book was first published the rave reviews for its courage in going there at all were followed by angry letters to the editor accusing Schlink of making a victim out of a former concentration camp guard. Humanizing someone isnt the same as apologizing for them -- the horror of Hitler was precisely that he was human which implicates us all -- but having read the book twice I cant make up my mind on that one. Which is rather the point for Schlinks subject is the bewilderment and moral uncertainty of a German generation whose parents maintained a stubborn silence about what they knew and did -- or didnt know and didnt do -- in the War. The Reader is a book about the appalling cost of keeping quiet about genocide and about the possibility of recovering understanding and forgiving the past.Mimicking the novels back-and-forth structure the movie puts its head down and plods grimly through the memories of emotionally constipated law professor Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes for whom the role might have been written) of his summer-long postwar affair with tight-lipped tram conductress Hanna (Kate Winslet) to whom significantly he reads Chekhov and Tolstoy in between bouts of carnal abandon. Young Michael is played by the very good young German actor David Kross looking chuffed as the Cheshire Cat for the opportunity to begin his career in bed with a buck-naked Winslet whose effortless blend of wounded fragility and tempered steel provides The Reader whatever momentum it can rustle up.After vanishing from Michaels life one day without warning Hanna reappears years later middle-aged and defiant as she stands trial for her crimes then old and baggy and defeated -- yet still unremorseful -- as she waits to get out of prison. Hanna has a secret that once revealed will either evoke your pity or cause you to shrug along with a survivor of her past crimes and say ""So what?"" As a literary device her cover-up is a little clumsy yet its of enormous consequence in how we judge her the former lover whose life she may have destroyed and vice versa and indeed all of Germany. Where Schlink leaves that up to us Daldry and his screenwriter David Hare sew it all up with a moment of fatally damp redemption.Schlink writes with a studied lack of sensationalism in terse prose that heightens the drama on the page but also makes the story extremely difficult to film. Sidestepping the usual Auschwitz camp footage and unfolding mostly in a dingy bedroom and a provincial courthouse The Reader strives to honor Schlinks restraint and his struggle to avoid cliche. But like many narrative filmmakers who walk on their tippy-toes when dealing with the Holocaust neither Daldry nor Hare seem eager to make the material their own. Add to their timidity a pack of production troubles -- including a distracted director who was simultaneously working on the Broadway version of Billy Elliot two feral executives (Harvey Weinstein and Scott Rudin) scrapping publicly over the release date and the death of two beloved producers (Anthony Minghella and Sidney Pollack) during production -- and its not hard to see why the movie version came out such a flat respectful pudding. Theres more life energy and imagination in the thrilling final seconds of Daldrys feather-light movie Billy Elliot when a grown-up Billy limbers up in his Swan Lake costume in the wings of an English theater than in the long lifelessly worthy road taken by The Reader.THE READER | Directed by STEPHEN DALDRY | Written by DAVID HARE based on the novel by BERNHARD SCHLINK | Produced by ANTHONY MINGHELLA SYDNEY POLLACK DONNA GIGLIOTTI and REDMOND MORRIS | Released by the Weinstein Company | The Grove Landmark Monica 4-Plex and ArcLight Sherman Oaks Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Winslets Hanna is a former Auschwitz guard who after the war has a stern little love affair with a 15-year-old boy named Michael (who as an older man remembering the past is played by Ralph Fiennes). Although the script works in a couple of pages of collegiate-level ethical debate about ""the question of German guilt"" what the movie is really interested in is the question of German sex. So think of it as ""Schindlers Lust."" Those who have daydreamed (and who hasnt?) of a nude Kate Winslet barking ""You dont matter enough to upset me"" or ""Read to me first den ve make luff"" are in for a treat. But German accents can either be funny or terrifying and this movie isnt terrifying. Michael is a lad who happens to meet the ticket-taker Hanna on a rainy day and later helps bring her coal from the cellar. When his face gets dirty she orders him ""Take off your clothes"" and get in the bath. Jawohl Lots of scenes follow in which she soaps him down with perhaps excessive briskness or shares a bath with him as he reads to her. When he tries ""Lady Chatterleys Lover"" she frowns. ""Dis is disgusting. You should be ashamed. Go on."" When he reads her ""Tintin"" she says ""Dats enuff for today kid"" while unbuttoning her shirt. Who knew reading could be so much fun? Michael has no idea that she has a secret past in the Nazi party. In the second hour when the movie stops seeming like a letter that begins ""Dear Penthouse Forum"" as directed by Lina Wertmuller and produced by Oprah Winfrey we leap decades into the future when young Michael is a law student and then a lawyer. He wanders into the trial of Hanna to witness in horror her admission that she was one of the guards who not only worked at Auschwitz but selected prisoners to be sent to their deaths. ""I heard dere were jobs"" is about the extent of her explanation. A bit of mulling of deep questions follows but ""How could they?"" is pretty much it and there is no answer. There is also momentarily a more complicated discussion of the legality of prosecuting Nazis after the fact but this is not dealt with in any serious way. Meanwhile we keep getting told (instead of shown) that the middle-age Michael as played by Fiennes is an unusually closed emotionally reserved person (there is a clinical word for this personality type ""German""). But so what? People who grew up in postwar Germany learned not to pry into each others lives too much and whether Michael will let some of his feelings out isnt a particularly compelling question in the context of the Holocaust. As for the Would You Bonk a Nazi? angle it makes for some nice heavy breathing but Wertmuller pretty much took it as far as it could go in ""Seven Beauties"" about a guy who has sex with a grotesque woman officer at a concentration camp to save his own life. In ""The Reader"" the situation doesnt have any moral component since Michael is unaware of Hannas past when they have the affair - not that teen boy hormones are any more responsive to moral suasion than say a tornado. The second half of the film does have some touching moments about how the most basic human components can intersect with the most extreme deeds but expectations for a satisfying wrap-up either emotionally or plotwise are left unmet. ""Go to the theater if you want catharsis"" says one character. I was sitting in a theater and I wanted it. It wasnt there. kyle.smithnypost.com THE READER Just Reich a Woman.

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday December 9 2008 1048 PM Provocatively intentioned ""The Reader"" is a movie worth seeing - the kind of film youll think about for days afterward. But when all is said and done youre likely to wonder why the impact wasnt greater still. Kate Winslet dons an impressive Teutonic accent to play Hanna Schmitz a thirtysomething tram conductor in 1958 Germany. When 15-year-old Michael (David Kross) gets sick outside her door she takes care of him and sends him home. A few months later he returns to thank her and the two begin a passionate affair in which he reads classic works of literature to her and she teaches him the ways of the world. Eight years on Michael is an idealistic law student attending a war-crimes trial with his class. To his immense shock Hanna is the prime defendant. She was it seems a guard at Auschwitz and directly responsible for the deaths of prisoners. Utterly stunned Michael spends the rest of his life attempting to process this revelation along with other disturbing aspects of a relationship that so deeply affected him. (An impassive Ralph Fiennes plays Michael as an older adult.) Director Stephen Daldry and screenwriter David Hare who also made ""The Hours"" together approach their source material - Bernhard Schlinks best-selling novel - with great respect. Perhaps too much in fact since there isnt nearly enough messiness in this very complicated scenario. Though Winslet does excellent work within the limits shes given her character remains a frustrating cipher. We never get more than the merest glimpse of her nature and have no real understanding of her motivations at any point. Both she and Kross spend much of the movie unclothed but only he comes across as truly exposed. Part of this is unavoidable since the story offers only Michaels perspective. But Daldry and Hare are demanding a great deal of us that we see the darkest immorality as unexpectedly complex and worthy of discussion. Maybe it is. But before we can respond to their request we need to hear the right questions which are asked too tentatively here.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The film is notable for its nice performances its handsome photography and its very active music. If the preceding praise sounds generic so is the movie Everything is admirable worthy and muffled in a blanket of Britishness in this well-bred production which reunites director Stephen Daldry with screenwriter David Hare six years after The Hours. But nothing pierces shocks or challenges with an originality that meets the source material even halfway. Certainly the story by Bernhard Schlink is a grabber (millions in Oprahs Book Club have already grabbed it). Michael (fresh-faced newcomer David Kross) a teenage boy in postwar Germany tumbles into a secretive affair with Hanna (Kate Winslet) a passionate older woman. The liaison is hot with sex during which Winslet once again demonstrates her endearing talent for being honest while naked; as foreplay Michael reads great books to his literature-hungry lover. Then Hanna vanishes -- and when Michael sees her next hes a law student observing a courtroom where shes on trial for crimes committed in Hitlers name. Ralph Fiennes has perhaps the toughest job playing the morose adult Michael -- a version we can assume of the author. Fiennes masters the default demeanor of someone perpetually pained. The Reader similarly represents a received notion of a significant movie with a Holocaust theme. B?

Young Michael (David Kross) reads to a much older Hanna (Kate Winslet) before and after lovemaking in The Reader. By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Reader (   out of four) is a slow-moving but absorbing story of sexual awakening and moral dilemmas. Director Stephen Daldry (The Hours) has intelligently adapted Bernhard Schlinks novel set in post-World War II Germany. Though the effort is uneven its a well-acted romance that becomes a less compelling courtroom drama. Kate Winslet is especially good as the taciturn Hanna a thirtysomething ticket taker on an urban train who starts a clandestine affair with bright 15-year-old Michael (David Kross). Their romance is equal parts carnal and literary Hanna calls upon Michael to read to her before and after lovemaking. She doesnt care much for conversation and falls into inexplicable rages but she loves a good book. Michael is entranced. They travel to the countryside where she is taken for his mother but that doesnt seem to faze Michael. Though their forbidden relationship seems doomed from the start Michaels youthful ardor doesnt get the chance to cool. Hanna is offered a job promotion and withdraws from his life as suddenly as she entered it. She reappears eight years later when Michael is in law school. She is being tried along with others for war crimes during her time as a guard at Auschwitz. Here the film bogs down in repetitive testimony. But Hanna has yet another secret she is guarding even more closely. Its a nearly insurmountable challenge to see Hanna as a sympathetic figure given her role in the Holocaust. But somehow Michael is still mesmerized. Or perhaps he simply cant shake the power she had over him as a teen. The audience will be faced with its own dilemma How moved one is by the films conclusion hinges on the ability to muster compassion for Hanna. The adult Michael is played by Ralph Fiennes who is excellent at conveying tamped-down emotions and moral confusion. Michael has grown into a cerebral man unable or unwilling to connect with women. The stories of his emotional thawing and his heady first love are deftly intertwined. Adapted by David Hare The Reader raises thorny questions and avoids simple answers. Michaels morality is left disturbingly unclear. This tale of eroticism secrecy and guilt is bound to stir discussion. (Rating R for some scenes of sexuality and nudity.

"Reader The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; reader-the ) Reader The (United States/Germany 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Reader is closer to a near miss than a rousing success but on balance this is still worth seeing for those who enjoy complexity and moral ambiguity within the context of a melodrama. Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink the film asks big questions about the nature of evil and how sin like disease can be contagious. And while not making excuses for those who participated in the Holocaust The Reader becomes the latest Nazi-related motion picture to question whether redemption is an option or a possibility for someone who has committed monstrous acts. The film is told bookend style (an unnecessarily convoluted approach) with the lead character Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes as an adult; David Kross as a teenager) reflecting on his life from his current time period which is 1995. Michaels first meeting with Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) occurs in West Berlin in 1958. She is a somewhat reclusive toll taker on trams; he is a 15-year old boy coming down with Scarlet Fever. She finds him doubled over near her apartment and brings him home. After recovering from the illness Michael seeks her out to thank her and the two begin an affair. It is brief but passionate and combines sex with episodes in which Michael reads passages of literature to her. Eventually perhaps recognizing that she is holding Michael back Hanna vanishes. Michael learns nothing more about her until 1966 when she goes on trial for contributing to the murder of 300 Jews while she was serving as an SS guard at Auschwitz. For the most part the movie is a faithful adaptation of the book when it comes to large plot points but the devil is in the details. Subtleties and nuances that exist in the novel and which can be presented in the first-person narrative are missing from the more straightforward movie. The first 2/3 of the film is by far its strongest part. Those scenes which catalogue the affair and the impact the revelations about Hannas past have upon Michael provide rich drama and pose some troubling philosophical questions. As a teenager Michaels only interaction with Hanna was with a passionate woman who showed no hints of a dark past. The subsequent emotional cataclysm creates in Michael a sense of deep obsessive conflict. He is torn between protecting the woman he loved and recoiling from the horror of her earlier deeds. Further complicating matters is a realization that he possesses information that could mitigate the charges and provide a lighter sentence for her. Films that elect to present Nazis as three-dimensional characters face a thorny moral dilemma. By being too sympathetic toward such a character there is a danger of diminishing his or her complicity in genocide. On the other side lies the potential for a caricature of evil. The Reader adeptly treads a line between the two never excusing or denying what Hanna did but also indicating that for her it did not define her life. For the most part she locks away the past and lives only in the present. The movie does not rehabilitate her. In the real world there were probably more Hannas than the demonic Nazis we are used to seeing in movies as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Schindlers List. To the extent that Hanna is presented in a positive light early in the film (although its legitimately questionable whether a woman having an affair with a 15-year old boy can be considered ""positive"") this is easily explained in that the point-of-view is Michaels. Until he learns of her past she is nothing more than his first love - the woman who taught him about sex and in whose company he spent many fondly remembered afternoons. It is also noteworthy that while Hanna does not appear overly intelligent during the films early scenes the depth of her lack of education and overall ignorance do not become obvious until later. The film which is structured in a needlessly choppy and non-linear fashion loses momentum and focus once it moves beyond the 1966 trial. The segments in the late 70s 80s and 90s lack the foundation of the early chapters. They are in the book but are given more prominence in the film than in the source material. Yes we understand that as an adult Michael is still obsessed with Hanna and his obsession is not healthy but thats about all we glean from 40 minutes worth of material. While Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor his portion of the movie is let down by the screenplay which causes him to drift. Most of the truly meaningful scenes with Michael are executed by David Kross who provides an excellent portrayal of a confused teenager who grows into a conflicted young man. Kate Winslet sheds some of her glamour for this role. When we first meet Hanna she is in her mid-thirties. Physically her best years are behind her but she is still comely and Michaels attraction is understandable. As has been true throughout her career Winslet has no qualms about nakedness. Many of her early scenes in the film are played in the nude and there is no sense of self-consciousness from either her or Kross (who has his own full-frontal scenes filmed shortly after the actor turned 18). As the story progresses the makeup used to age Winslet is generally effective. Her portrayal of Hanna is note-perfect this is precisely how one might imagine such a woman who perhaps has never truly come to grips with the enormity of her crimes would react under these circumstances. In one sense The Reader is as difficult a film as The Boy in the Striped Pajamas in that both films show how the horror of Auschwitz was hidden behind a curtain of ordinariness. At one point during The Reader one character condemns not only the likes of Hanna but the whole of the previous generation of Germans for their willful ignorance of what was happening to the Jews. This question of responsibility and culpability has left a deep scar on the collective German consciousness that even now has not healed and there are indications of it spread throughout The Reader. So although Stephen Daldrys (Billy Elliot) film falls short of the greatness for which it strives it is nevertheless a workmanlike adaptation. And there is enough intelligent compelling material here to make it worthwhile as a meditation about the post-World War II implications of the Holocaust upon the German psyche and as the tale of the tragedy suffered by one man because at a vulnerable time of his life he fell in love with the wrong person.

By Anthony Lane Mickey Rourke as Randy (the Ram) Robinson in Darren Aronofskys movie.   Credit Illustration by Quickhoney For some years Mickey Rourke was just about my favorite movie star. This was not an easy stance to take. The body of the mans work was dismayingly thin and the body of good work from ""Rumble Fish"" onward could be counted on the knuckles of one fist. As for the body of the man it swelled from taut and slender to something so bulbous and spongiform that those of us who had thrilled to Boogie his cocky romancer in ""Diner"" could only wince and look away. Yet I insist there was a time when Rourke demanded to be looked at catching and holding your eye no less grippingly than the young De Niro. Sweetness and menace were folded up in him--in the way that he angled himself at the world as if both sure of his place within it and deeper down afraid that it might still spit him out. Hence the voice never a bellow or a screech nor yet a Brando-haunted mumble but the soft croon of a conspirator; remember him as the arsonist for hire in ""Body Heat"" forcing his employers to lean in close lest they miss his wicked meaning. That whisper of secrecy remained in Stanley White with his stiff gray hair his long coat and his vows of judicial vengeance. Stanley was the cop whom Rourke played in ""Year of the Dragon"" and everything about the project shouted overkill script by Oliver Stone direction by Michael Cimino and a racial attitude that was designed to rile. But there was Rourke holding steady at the core of the storm. And now the voice is back. In ""The Wrestler"" directed by Darren Aronofsky Rourke is Robin Ramzinski known to his admirers as Randy (the Ram) Robinson. The body is now a glistening mound of bruised and damaged goods and the quiff of Stanley White has been replaced by a mop of ropy blond extensions that you could wipe the floor with. Twenty years ago as the opening credits show Randy was a star on the wrestling circuit but the film follows him as he burns away. He lives in a trailer in New Jersey except that right now he doesnt; the landlord has locked him out for not paying the rent. Randy joshes with the local kids and plays Nintendo with one of them--""a really old game"" according to the boy who is used to Call of Duty. Such is modern senescence to age as quickly as a video game. Randy still wrestles but the cash is petty and he boosts his income by heaving boxes at a supermarket. He has a friend a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) but she has no plans to be his girlfriend. Then there is Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) his daughter although they havent met in years. When they do hook up things improve--too fast it turns out as if reconciliation were more of a dream than a practical goal. They book a dinner but Randy gets drunk misses the date and loses her once more. ""An old broken-down piece of meat"" he calls himself. ""Im alone and I deserve to be alone."" To some extent as that speech suggests ""The Wrestler"" is as simple as its title. The pathos of personal ruin is an established trope and the trick as demonstrated by John Huston in ""Fat City"" and by Martin Scorsese in ""Raging Bull"" is to stop it from sliding into the sentimental. Aronofsky doesnt always succeed in this and there are lines in Robert D. Siegels script that wave their symbolic purpose in the audiences face ""Its your heart--you need to start taking better care of it."" So says a hospital medic when Randy is admitted and undergoes bypass surgery after collapsing in the wake of a bout. Its O.K. Doc we get the point. But the movie like its hero manages to yank itself back into shape and that it strikes me is mostly due to Rourke. When Randy goes home after the operation and peels off his bandage the camera zooms in to inspect the scar on his chest whereas what really pinches our attention is his harmless habits the mild uncomplaining manner in which he pops in a hearing aid or adjusts his reading spectacles. He may be one of the last people in movies to use a pay phone. This fellow is mutton dressed as Ram and he knows it and if he earns the caress of our pity that is precisely because he never stoops to beg for it. There is no denying the brutality of ""The Wrestler"" and some of the scenes in the ring especially those which provoke the cardiac arrest are hard to watch. The movie comes off as inoffensive however since unusually for these times it trades in violence cleansed of ill will. The wrestlers are a club greeting one another as brothers in arms or in headlocks; one of them cheerfully sells Randy almost a thousand dollars worth of steroids and other drugs and in place of the hypocritical masking that bedevils major sports there is a peculiar honesty almost a decorum running beneath the overcooked beefcake and the staged aggression of the fights. ""What do you want to do tonight?"" one opponent asks Randy as if inviting him to the theatre before proposing that he enliven that evenings bout by puncturing his rival with a staple gun. You could call them cardboard characters pierced and flattened for the delight of the crowd but Aronofsky cast the minor roles with real wrestlers and you believe in every scourging of the flesh. For all that the best sequence in the film even more likely to lodge in your mind than the soaring sadness of the climax takes place not on the wrestlers canvas with its carpet of blood and broken glass but at the deli counter of the supermarket. Here Randy needing the money dons a protective hairnet and doles out pasta salad. He even pins on a name tag that says ""Robin"" randiness being too rich for this clientele. The dent to his pride is profound more wounding than any professional blow to the head and the scene closes in agony as he takes out his frustration on a meat slicer. But heres the thing while the job lasts hes pretty good at it bringing a brief shaft of pleasure to the customers and suffering any taunts that come his way. What Rourke offers us in short is not just a comeback performance but something much rarer a rounded raddled portrait of a good man. Suddenly there it is again--the charm the anxious modesty the never-distant hint of wrath the teen-age smiles and all the other virtues of a winner. No wonder people warmed to Randy Robinson twenty years ago. I felt the same about Mickey Rourke and I still do. For those who think of cinema as dramatic roughage ""The Reader"" should prove sufficiently indigestible. Directed by Stephen Daldry and adapted by David Hare from the novel by Bernhard Schlink it stars Kate Winslet as Hanna Schmitz a tram conductor in the German town of Neustadt. In 1958 she embarks on an affair with a fifteen-year-old schoolboy named Michael (David Kross). ""Look at me kid"" she says casually adopting the Humphrey Bogart position. They fall into the swing of a routine first he reads to her then they make love. In many ways the ideal existence. Time slouches on and in 1966 Michael now a law student sees Hanna again this time in a courtroom where she is being tried for her actions as an S.S. guard. He should be shocked by this revelation but Kross--who I regret to say is borderline bovine throughout--merely lowers his muzzle and pants a bit and Daldry himself seems to miss the moment as if he had spent too long chewing it over. The whole film in fact with its loping pace and plaintive score feels like a woefully polite not to say British take on a foreign horror; was there really no one from the fierce new wave of German filmmakers prepared to dramatize the Schlink? Or did they feel as I did that it was pernicious from the start--a low-grade musing on atrocity garnished with erotic titillation? Imprisoned for life Hanna must read to herself but are we really supposed to be moved by the thought--or now in Daldrys film by the sight--of an unrepentant Nazi parsing Chekhov? That is not culturally nourishing; it is morally famished. There is a fine scene near the end when a survivor of Hannas crimes (the great Lena Olin) tells the middle-aged Michael (Ralph Fiennes) that ""nothing came out of the camps"" that they ""werent therapy."" Quite true so why has the film pretended otherwise? Still ""The Reader"" is a triumph of bite and speed compared with ""Doubt."" This film written and directed by John Patrick Shanley who adapted it from his own play unfolds in 1964 at a Catholic school in the Bronx. A jovial priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is accused by the principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) of interfering with an altar boy. He denies it she yearns to believe it and we dont care. Collectors of large narrative signposts will spend a happy couple of hours at Shanleys movie enjoying the window-rattling thunderstorms that he uses to indicate spiritual crisis and the grimness with which Sister Aloysius narrowing her red-rimmed eyes delivers the line ""So its happened."" I didnt know you could hiss groan and murmur at the same time but Streep can do anything. She is of course wasted on this elephantine fable; if only ""Doubt"" had been made in 1964 shot by Roger Corman over a long weekend and retitled ""Spawn of the Devil Witch"" or ""Blood Wimple"" all would have been forgiven.

Director Stephen Daldry (""The Hours"") and playwright David Hare have taken up the challenge of turning this double-edged cerebral book into a film and its not surprising--movies being better at the visible than the internal--that the eroticism trumps the moral complexity.Fifteen-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross) is a well-educated schoolboy who in 1958 falls into a passionate relationship with a secretive tough working-class wo-man 20 years older. Hanna (Kate Winslet) is a woman of few words sudden rages and a hungry sexual appetite thats matched by her equal ardor for literature; she demands as foreplay that Michael read Homer Twain and Chekhov to her.Then one day after seeing each other in secret all summer Hanna vanishes. The next time Michael spots her eight years later hes a law student witnessing a war-crimes trial--and Hanna is in the dock. Shes willing to confess her role as a guard at Auschwitz but she has one secret--a far less damning one--that she clings to with even deeper shame. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ""The Reader"" is not about the horrors of the ""final solution."" Its about how Michael deals with the fact that the great first love of his life was implicated in these atrocities. Ralph Fiennes plays Michael in middle age-- a parched solitary man of the law whose unusual relationship with the older Hanna raises questions about his own moral compass. ""The Reader"" can feel stilted and abstract the films only flesh-and-blood characters spend half the movie separated. But its emotional impact sneaks up on you. ""The Reader"" asks tough questions and to its credit provides no easy answers.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?
