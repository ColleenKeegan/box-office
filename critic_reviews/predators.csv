Last seen battling a rival franchises beasties in the energetically silly ""Alien vs. Predator"" and its sequel (in which they were the good guys sorta) those Rastafarian-coiffed killer space aliens are back in ""Predators."" Robert Rodriguez-produced pic puts a bulked-up Adrien Brody in Arnold Schwarzeneggers erstwhile shoes to clamorous if uninvolving results. Nonetheless dudes looking for some basic splattery action while their girlfriends are off seeing ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" (again) should give this a muscular B.O. sendoff even if legs may be longer in ancillary. Script by Alex Litvak and Michael Finch bears more resemblance to the superior 1987 original ""Predator"" than to its intervening sequels at least in the early going. Replacing that films commando unit is a motley crew of militaristic or just plain violent types plucked from around the globe. Each one experiences a flash of light then awakens mid-freefall from an airplane plummeting into an unknown jungle with whatever weapons he or she was already carrying. The eight whose chutes open in time (others arent so lucky) are gruff mercenary Royce (Brody) Israeli Defense Forces sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga) Russian soldier Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov) Colombian drug cartel enforcer Cuchillo (Danny Trejo) Sierra Leone death squad member Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) Yakuza hitman Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and convicted mass murderer Stans (Walton Goggins). Odd man out is mild-mannered doctor Edwin (Topher Grace) whose reason for being here (beyond providing some comic relief) remains unclear until a late speech rendered near-incomprehensible by audio distortion. These testy strangers (fortunately all English speakers) uneasily band together for survival against various perils the initial ones being booby traps and an attack by spike-covered boar-like creatures. Once they arrive at a clearing and can see the sky theres another unpleasant surprise Theyre not on Earth. Its at this point Royce deduces ""This planet is a game preserve and we are the game."" Indeed they are being hunted by the ""predators"" of prior pics with their invisibility shields and solarized point-of-view shots. The groups ranks steadily thin as they attempt to escape then hunt the hunters eventually meeting up with a lone human survivor (Laurence Fishburne laying it on thick) of several hunting seasons. Directed by Nimrod Antal (of the impressive Hungarian ""Kontroll"" as well as Hollywood suspensers ""Vacancy"" and ""Armored"") ""Predators"" serves up its parade of frantic chases explosions and slugfests with brute-force competence. But its also somewhat monotonous with action pausing only for clunky dialogue some icky moments but no memorable thrills and a fadeout that provides the characters (and viewers) little reward for their toil. Theres also the problem of the predators themselves. Original pic smartly kept them a mostly unseen menace; once they make themselves known here theres far too much time (especially during a couple of mano-a-mano fight scenes) in which to ponder how they resemble tricked-up 1950s monsters such as the Creature From the Black Lagoon the Gill-Man et al. Perfs are adequate in a movie lacking much use for better ones though Brody disappoints by using the stock sotto voce rasp of the uber-macho action hero who really really means business. Design elements are solid Gyula Padoss lensing making good use of locations in Hawaii Texas and California. John Debneys score offers standard bombast.

Adrien Brody star as a battlefield veteran who is taken from Earth to a planet ruled by an alien race that uses the humans in a hunting game in Predators. Photo Rico Torres Associated Press Predators 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Predators bills itself as sci-fi horror -- a big bad sequel to the 1987 and 1990 originals not the recent Alien vs. Predator franchise. But you cant fool me. I know its actually a parlor game. Also known as Wholl Die First? Predators asks players to determine who among its nine human characters will die miserably at the hands of lizardlike alien hunters. If youve played any variation on this game before you know that the aliens employ thermal imaging and bend light so they appear more or less invisible. Shimmering into view they display some truly awesome dreadlocks. The object of their game is to skewer spindle and mutilate as many humans as possible. The object of our game is to guess which character will bite it at what time. The game ends when most everyone is dead or two Predators head-butt in battle whichever comes first. The winner is the player who predicts the most casualties and/or holds down his popcorn during the decapitation scenes. Extra points for accurately foretelling Topher Graces character arc. (I win) Grace plays the nerdiest human on this distant planet some unnamed jungle paradise with multiple moons. His character a twitchy young doctor arrives in an airdrop with a bunch of killers warriors and scuzzbags who were suddenly beamed off planet Earth and chucked onto an extraterrestrial game farm. The premise is similar to director Nimrod Antals other work (Armored Vacancy and Kontroll) which also features humans dying one by one in nasty circumstances. The first prey we meet is Adrien Brodys character a black-ops mercenary who wakes just in time to deploy his parachute (cool). The second is Danny Trejo as an Uzi-packing Latino. The third is Nikolai a burly and rather stupid Russian soldier (Oleg Taktarov). Fourth Alice Braga as a woman warrior. Fifth is a dapper Japanese guy with exactly two lines (Louis Ozawa Changchien). Six and seven are a large gloomy African (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) and a skeevy death-row inmate in an orange jumpsuit (Walton Goggins). And the eighth hanging from a tree is Grace. The wild card is the ninth person Laurence Fishburnes character who deserves an in-depth Freudian analysis of his own. But for now Ill call him the bastard child of Colonel Kurtz and the Fisher-Price Chatter Phone in Toy Story 3. Before you start guessing Ill drop some hints. Such as The character who would in most cases be the first to croak in any given horror movie actually dies second. The character who speaks in four-word chunks is the same character who shows up for the climax shirtless and slathered in mud. And the character who most deserves to die in a repulsive sadistic manner gets his spine ripped directly from his body. None of this is scary and nothing makes sense. Michael Finch and Alex Litvaks barely literate screenplay is just an excuse for Gyula Padoss snazzy cinematography and John Debneys smashing crashing romantic orchestral score which seems to hail from another film entirely (a good one?). But perhaps thats part of the game. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bushnell Off Trail GPS for 29 + free shipping Marc New York Womens Lace Sheath Dress for 26 + 8 samp;h 3P Military Tactical Oxford 30L Backpack for 12 + free shipping Kids Jackets at Columbia Up to 70% off + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 08 2010 311PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Predators Directed by Nimrod Antal Written by Alex Litvak and Michael Finch Starring Adrien Brody Laurence Fishburne Topher Grace Alice Braga and Walton Goggins Classification 14A Not quite a sequel and not exactly a reboot Predators is perhaps best described as a revival - and a reverent one - of a movie franchise that began in 1987 with John McTiernans Predator. In the singular original Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the leader of an elite squad of military types who are dropped into the Guatemalan jungle and find themselves being hunted by an armed alien life form (with the ability to track them using thermal imaging and to cloak its presence) that starts killing them one by one. Predator has endured as a popular cult flick but in terms of the franchise it was downhill after that. A 1990 sequel starring Danny Glover and set in L.A. was a dud. Two ""crossover"" Alien vs. Predator flicks released last decade were even worse. During the interval between the sequels Austin filmmaker Robert Rodriguez - a writer-director who was the hot new property in Hollywood in the early 1990s - was hired to write a new screenplay to reignite the franchise but it never got made. Two new writers have turned his original work into a functional script that pretty much stays the safe course - with a couple of decent twists to keep things interesting. But its the old-school approach of director Nimrod Antal (resisting the 3-D trend relying on costumes sets and physical action as opposed to loads of CGI effects) and some spirited performances that give Predators its teeth. The basic set-up is that a multi-racial group of hardened military killers and criminals and a fraidy-cat doctor (Topher Grace) who seems the odd man out here are individually captured (carrying whatever arms they happen to have on hand at the time) and dropped in cages by parachute into a thick jungle. At first unknown to each other (they mostly dont bother with names) they are forced to work together to figure out where they are who brought them there and why. Adrien Brody adopting a manly growl (and either buffed up or wearing a muscle vest) is wonderfully cast against type as the ruthless mercenary who appoints himself leader and is the first to figure out theyre prey. In what one can only assume is a deliberately cliche B-movie moment the group emerges from the jungle to the edge of ridge and everyone realizes theyre not in Kansas anymore - the sky is jammed with planets and moons of various sizes. Alice Bragas Israeli sniper - a refreshing female presence in the mix - reveals she knows something about the alien hunter and shares the basic plot of the Predator story which she heard about through the elite military grapevine. The gang gets more detailed info about what theyre in for with the surprise arrival of Laurence Fishburne in an over-the-top turn as a lone survivor who had scavenged to stay alive while slowly going cuckoo a la Marlon Brandos Colonel Kurtz. The best scene in the movie is actually the quietest when Louis Ozawa Changchien who plays a tight-lipped Japanese gangster strips down to the waist for a sword fight against one of the three alien hunters in an open field of wind-swept grass. Otherwise Predators follows the sweaty desperate bunch as they are knocked off one by one until only Brody Braga and Graces characters are left to make a run for a cloaked spaceship near the hunters campsite. Of course there are a couple more twists around the corner. Like its forerunners and several other movies of varying quality Predators is rooted in a widely anthologized 1924 story by Richard Connell called The Most Dangerous Game in which a big-game hunter falls off a yacht swims to an island and is hunted by a bored Russian aristocrat also a big-game enthusiast who eerily seems to know much about his latest human prey. Predators never gives us the satisfaction of knowing what motivates the alien hunters to use humans for sport but at least it has fun showing us that humans can indeed be the most dangerous game.

They land in a lush green jungle that seems to resemble no known place on Earth. All they can remember from the moments prior to their arrival is a flash of bright white light.There are eight of them all of whom seem to have some kind of background in violence a black-ops mercenary (Adrien Brody); a CIA assassin (Alice Braga); a soldier for a Mexican drug cartel (Danny Trejo); a murderer on death row (Walton Goggins); and so forth. Soon they realize that they have been sent here as prey to be hunted and destroyed by an alien race seeking out new forms of diversion.Thats the set-up for Predators which borrows heavily from The Most Dangerous Game and Lost to reinvigorate a franchise that in its most recent incarnation the two Alien vs. Predator films devolved into comic book-sci-fi inanity (they were like Ed Wood movies with considerably more expensive special effects). Movie Information PredatorsRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Nimrod AntalStarring Adrien Brody Alice Braga Danny Trejo and Topher GraceRun time 106 minutesMPAA rating R (strong creature violence and gore and pervasive language)Synopsis Adrien Brody and Laurence Fishburne head a cast thats dropped on an alien planet as prey.More movies from GuideLive.comThis new version tries to restore some of the straight-ahead intensity of the original 1987 Predator while also pushing it deeper into the realm of old-fashioned horror. It turns out our heroes are trapped on the home planet of the Predators and they must face off against these snarling dreadlocked monsters - not to mention their feral tusked pets - and find a way to escape.What the movie lacks though is any sense of fear. Predators was directed by Nimrod Antal (Vacancy) but it was produced by Austin-based filmmaker Robert Rodriguez whose fingerprints are all over it. Like most of Rodriguezs work this movie only seems to come alive when its at its most gleefully juvenile as limbs get sliced and body cavities are torn open and the Predators spew neon-green blood.Rodriguez loves his creatures and he and Antal take evident delight in populating this planet with as many different monsters as possible - to the exclusion of any real character or plot development. Nothing seems to matter here other than the goo and the gore.Predators with its screenplay by Alex Litvak and Michael Finch is hardly terrible; in fact theres a nifty bit involving a Japanese yakuza played by Louis Ozawa Changchien challenging one of the monsters to a sword battle. But the movie doggedly refuses to come to life perhaps because the actors feel so secondary.As the self-appointed leader of the humans Brody lacks the brawn of a proper action hero not to mention the charm; the few attempts to generate a romance between Brody and Braga go nowhere. Both Topher Grace as a doctor who doesnt seem to fit in with this group of professional killers and Laurence Fishburne a mysterious man they encounter on the island are wasted.The final sections of Predators feature a massive grenade explosion a spaceship getting blown to bits and venom that once injected renders a person paralyzed - in other words as with most of this summers action movies its barely comprehensible chaos.Thats when you fully realize how many opportunities have been squandered (the Predators infrared vision and invisibility so integral to the nervous energy of the original film go mostly unexploited) and how little heart or playfulness is on display. Predators mostly just suggests a bunch of grown-up men playing with toys and not bothering to invite the rest of us into their circle. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Most pressing question after seeing Predators Any governors in this cast? - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 starsMost pressing question after seeing Predators Any governors in this cast?July 08 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Predators"" plural starts well and ends poorly and in the middle its in the middle. The original 1987 ""Predator"" featuring future politicians Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura was an entertaining hybrid of the commando genre and ""Alien""-inspired science fiction. The new one directed by Nimrod Antal (""Kontroll"") lifts its building blocks from an unproduced 1990s script by Robert Rodriguez who ended up producing the revised screenplay by Alex Litvak and Michael Finch. For a while its a worthy successor or remake or whatever it is. Instead of the Central American jungle of the original the action takes place ... somewhere ""else"" lets say (the reveal comes early but who am I to spoil your day?). In the prologue a motley multinational crew of thugs drops from the sky having free-fallen from places unknown. They do not know one another and hail from different countries -- Japan Russia what have you. What is this a dream? Hell? ""What if were dead?"" asks one of the eight clearly a fan of ""Lost."" Soon enough they determine their location and whos trying to eviscerate them. As in the Reagan-era version the new films dreadlocked monster can sense the presence of humans by their body heat. His stealthy point of view is depicted as B-grade infrared heat-sensitive imagery. Also as in the original theres a chameleonic quality to the critters comings and goings. There is more than one species of beastie this time though. Some alarming four-legged spiky affairs come calling first and in the rousing chase sequence showcasing their abilities the computer animations quite impressive. So is the cast. Adrien Brodys growling mercenary; Topher Graces befuddled physician; Laurence Fishburnes wily survivalist; Alice Braga (zoo-wee-mama) as the eagle-eyed sharpshooter -- these are furrowed brows and sweaty countenances worth having in your killer-monster movie any day. Why then does ""Predators"" begin deflating around the midpoint and never quite recover? Its a matter of scope. The early scenes shot primarily in Hawaii are spacious and expansive and nicely paced without becoming frantic. When the story relocates to the Fishburne characters grimy claustrophobic domicile the movie turns static. The filmmakers may have been going for an ""Alien"" industrial-grunge vibe but the tension just isnt sufficient. Some genre movies simply work out this way Whatever their intentions or origins they percolate for about an hour. And then they sputter and hope that a promising first half will be enough to get by. 2 stars mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong creature violence and gore and pervasive language) Cast Adrien Brody (Royce) Laurence Fishburne (Noland) Topher Grace (Edwin) Alice Braga (Isabelle) Walton Goggins (Stan) Danny Trejo (Cuchillo) Credits Directed by Nimrod Antal; written by Alex Litvak and Michael Finch; produced by Robert Rodriguez John Davis and Elizabeth Avellan.

Among others theres an elite mercenary (Adrien Brody) a comely Guatemalan freedom fighter (Alice Braga) a Southern-fried death-row psychopath (Walter Groggins) and an enforcer for a Mexican drug cartel (Danny Trejo). This is less a franchise reboot than a portmanteau of the original movie ABCs Lost hokey old World War II programmers and all the money in the world.

In this fine spawn of the 1987 original which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger there are aliens of the nonhuman variety naturally and there is alienation of a very human sort. Eight humans who have participated in or witnessed humanitys worst are dropped into a jungle where they soon learn whats for dinner them. American mercenary Royce played by Adrien Brody wakes in mid-plummet. In a vividly edited sequence he desperately tries to deploy his parachute. The landing is a spectacularly hard one. Director Nimrod Antal whose Hungarian debut ""Kontroll"" remains his finest work to date underscores the visceral. John Debneys score wastes nary a nanosecond cluing us into the films B-flick energy. Its got a little bombast a little urgency I am action flick hear me rumble. The humans -- a collection of mob enforcers well- trained special-ops soldiers and a convict -- bring to mind what action films were so good at back in the 80s international-ensemble mash-ups. The clique with the clashing accents was typically the bad guys. The point in ""Predators"" written by Alex Litvak and Michael Finch is that these protagonists are at best the not-so-good guys. In addition to Brodys soldier-with-the-gruff-delivery theres a Russian special-forces warrior beamed from Chechnya (mixed martial arts expert Oleg Taktarov); a Yakuza mobster (Louis Ozawa Chang- chien); a Mexican drug-cartel enforcer (Danny Trejo); a rebel from Sierra Leones atrocity-dealing Revolutionary United Front (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); and a yammering convicted felon (Walton Goggins). The two exceptions to the fog of nastiness might be the Israel Defense Force sniper (Alice Braga) and a clean-cut doctor (Topher Grace). Theres a lot of brutality implied in the groups resumes. But the script doesnt do much with the geopolitics. Theyre the hardest of the hard and the fact that they still cant hold a candle to the armored heat-seeking lethal predators becomes the gist of this solid ride. Brody adopts a Clint Eastwood husk to go with his Humphrey Bogart ethic of not getting dragged into caring. Royce is a sourpuss. Thats understandable but the best of this genre finds wry moments in the mayhem. For a beam of light ""Predators"" enlists Laurence Fishburne as the mysterious Noland. Twenty-three years later its nice to have a revised appreciation for the predators appearance. In 1987 when the beast faced off against its rather Aryan foe it was hard not to wonder -- loudly -- ""Whats with the dreadlocks?"" The predators still have the braids. But the zeitgeist has changed enough to see them separately from racial considerations. The aliens hypnotically horrid mandible tusks and waxy ickiness really is an achievement. Theirs are not the only faces that have a special command on-screen. Brodys visage -- with its hungering cheekbones and breakout nose -- is his calling card. Trejo who plays the drug-cartel enforcer has a face that is all sun-cracked wind- burnished terrain. While their close-ups cant compete with shots of the original creature (Derek Mears credited as ""Classic Predator"") they do remind us what wonders of cracks wrinkles and character humans can be.

"Movie review Predators washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Predators Movie review Predators Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 9 2010 Its hard to take ""Predators"" terribly seriously. And no it has nothing to do with the fact that Adrien Brody plays the action hero. The soulful slightly scrawny yet eccentrically handsome star -- whose last major movie ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" featured him in the role of Rickity the Field Mouse -- is hardly known for playing Schwarzenegger-style muscle men. Still he acquits himself well as the de facto leader of a bunch of terrestrial tough guys who have been mysteriously transported to an alien game preserve where they must use their wits and survival skills to avoid being killed by the same bloodthirsty critters that first stalked Ah-nuld in the 1987 ""Predator."" Rather the difficulty in keeping a straight face with this movie -- the fifth in the ""Predator"" franchise -- has more to do with just how much fun it seems to be having with lets face it its pretty silly premise. The giggles start from the get-go as black-ops agent Royce (Brody) is seen hurtling pell-mell through the sky screaming like a baby after being air-dropped from a plane into an unfamiliar jungle. When his parachute finally opens he lands with a thud next to seven other battle-hardened warriors including a Russian soldier (Oleg Taktarov); an enforcer for a Mexican drug cartel (Danny Trejo); a member of a Sierra Leone death squad (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); a Japanese mobster (Louis Ozawa Changchien); a convicted murderer and rapist (Walton Goggins); and a token female G.I. (Alice Braga). Oh yeah theres also a doctor (Topher Grace -- yeah that Topher Grace). For the longest time Royce/Brody cant seem to figure out what hes doing in this movie other than providing comic relief. Are you laughing yet? You will be. But in a good way. Stylishly directed by NimrA3d Antal (""Control"") and produced by Robert Rodriguez (""Planet Terror"") ""Predators"" is good if gory grindhouse fun. It tweaks the conventions of the summer monster movie even as it observes them. Thats not to say it isnt scary. It delivers the standard chills and thrills that one expects from the genre. And there are at least a couple of twists including the surprise appearance of an actor who shall remain nameless. Trust me its better that way. It also unfortunately delivers the familiar illogic and cliches of its ilk. ""Weve got to conserve ammunition"" says Royce right after everyone in the group has unloaded an armorys worth of bullets into a pack of alien hunting dogs that look sort of like Grus pooch in ""Despicable Me"" only meaner. Then theres the convict. Armed with nothing but a tiny presumably homemade shiv and dressed in a bright orange prison jumpsuit hes like walking alien bait. The question isnt whether hell bite the big one but when. As for the rest of the cast half the pleasure is guessing wholl die next. Its not all fun and games though. Writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch make a half-hearted attempt to philosophize about Mans predatory nature. ""Were the monsters of our own world"" says Bragas Isabelle to Royce during one of the films quiet moments. In the end however the films perverse party spirit wins out over any pretentious hoo-ha. How do we know the whole things meant to be a hoot? The closing credits roll over a rollicking recording of Little Richard singing ""Long Tall Sally"" a barnburner that includes the exhortation ""Have some fun tonight."" I suggest you let go and listen to the man.  1/2 R. At area theaters. Contains sexual humor a drug reference frequent obscenity and prodigious amounts of violence gore and alien goo. 106 minutes.

After 23 years and three attempts ""Predators"" finally delivers a solid sequel to the Arnold Schwarzenegger B-movie classic. Following more or less directly from the original ""Predator"" this amounts to a reasonably clever mash-up of ""Survivor"" ""Lost"" ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game"" among other genre exercises. Its directed by Hungarian Nimrod Antal (""Kontroll"") with sufficient briskness and style that nobody is going to be asking too many questions about plausibility. Buffed-up Oscar winner Adrien Brody is cast winningly against type as an erstwhile black-ops mercenary leading an international band of killers -- previously strangers to each other -- who have been abducted and dropped by parachute into a jungle with an apparently limitless supply of firearms ammunition and explosives. They guess at first theyre in the Amazon but they are a few light-years off. These anti-heroes quickly piece together that the whole planet is a game preserve where an alien race of humanoid predators has long hunted big game -- including humans -- during vacations. Antal and writer-producer Robert Rodriguez wisely keep the predators off-screen for most of the tongue-in-cheek first half although the balance has sufficient gore and action to satisfy fans. They spend time introducing us to a colorfully oddball squad that includes an Israeli sniper (Alice Braga) an American serial killer (Walton Goggins) a Mexican cocaine cartel hatchet man (Danny Trejo) an African death squad killer (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) and the inevitable Russian hulk (Oleg Taktarov). Among the unnamed characters is also a disgraced American doctor (Topher Grace) and a suited Japanese Yakuza (Louis Ozawa Chang- chien) who says little but crosses swords with one of the predators in the movies most memorable sequence. The venerable Laurence Fishburne puts in a chatty guest appearance as a longtime resident of the planet where the original-model predator from the first film is currently summering along with three more evolved versions as well as their very deadly pets. As before they are equipped with the powers of invisibility and thermal imaging. Its not exactly hard to predict who the survivors will be at the end of ""Predators"" but its a fun ride. When someone remarks theyve been dropped into hell Brody quips ""The last time I looked you didnt need a parachute to get there."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next NBC brags about Conans Emmy nominations after replacing h...

"Predators | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; predators ) Predators (United States 2010) July 08 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Predators is Robert Rodriguezs attempt to re-invigorate (but not reboot) the Predator franchise whose devaluation began with an ill-advised sequel accelerated as a result of the poorly realized Alien vs. Predator and bottomed out with the lifeless Alien vs. Predator 2. By borrowing cues from James Camerons Aliens playbook and pretending the two cross-franchise movies dont exist Rodriguez is able to at least return some dignity to Predators but the title characters arent as ferocious or as nasty as they once were and theres no Arnold Schwarzenegger (the first Predator was as much about the Governator - then at the peak of his popularity - as it was about the creature). Thats what happens when two movies water down monsters into pale shadows of their previous incarnations. Predators is a passable science fiction action/adventure tale that dumps a bunch of characters in the middle of a jungle setting and turns them into alien bait. Its not the most original basis for a movie but director Nimrod Antal and co-screenwriters Alex Litvak amp; Michael Finch provide some development for the individuals who stick around for more than a few scenes. Still to call any of them ""three-dimensional"" would be a stretch and the most entertaining aspect of Predators is what it usually is in this sort of movie guessing the order in which the characters will be eliminated and prognosticating which ones (if any) will be alive at the end. Predators reminded me most strongly of Pitch Black with a little Aliens thrown in for good measure. Casting Adrien Brody (against type) as the badass ex-special ops mercenary is a stroke of genius that may have sounded like the ravings of a lunatic when it was proposed. Brody has shown his acting chops in films like The Pianist and The Brothers Bloom but never before has he been asked to play an action anti-hero. His recent visibility in high-profile monster movies (King Kong Splice) has given him some credibility in the genre but putting him front-and-center in the Schwarzenegger role is a leap of faith... and Brody seemingly against all odds pulls it off. Buffed up and adopting a growl that would impress Christian Bale Brody never makes us doubt that his Royce is the kind of guy youd want back-to-back in a showdown against the meanest dudes in the universe. Brody is joined by the usual suspects representing as many genders and ethnic types as allowed by the limited number of characters (eight). Alice Braga is Isabelle the only one of the group with something approaching a conscience. Topher Grace is Edwin a suburban doctor whose purpose in the midst of so many killers is a mystery. Walter Goggins is Stans a death row convict whose idea of a relaxing afternoon is to ""rape a few bitches."" Oleg Taktarov is a Russian Louis Ozawa Changchien is a yakuza who swings a mean sword; Mahershalalhashbaz Ali in an African; and Danny Trejo is well Danny Trejo. Laurence Fishburne shows up in a role that seems to have been written for someone else. The setup has the eight strangers stranded on a ""game preserve planet"" where they are being hunted by aliens for sport. Their goal is survival which is difficult because their weapons are inferior to those of their pursuers and they cant see them. Royce (Brody) the natural leader decides that avoiding predators isnt the best objective when it comes to long-term survival. They must defeat the enemy then discover a way back to Earth. Predators suffers from uneven pacing. The first half is a little on the slow side and the movie is nearly 45 minutes old before the first predator makes an appearance. This would make sense if the goal of the movie was to build to the ""reveal"" but thats not the case. Instead the set up simply requires that the characters wander around in the jungle for about a half-hour occasionally avoiding traps and discovering clues regarding their situation. There is some tension but things begin to drag before the action kicks into high gear. Predators final third on the other hand is anything but slow. Instead it almost feels rushed with too much happening during a short period of time almost as if the filmmakers were concerned that the audiences attention span for this sort of production might not exceed 105 minutes. It should be mentioned however that as quickly as certain elements are wrapped up the final showdown is brutally satisfying. Although Predators is being firmly placed in the sequel-not-remake category it follows the broad outline of Predator even to the point where a variation of Schwarzeneggers end game is employed. Predator fans fearing another lapse into disappointment can relax. Although its arguably not saying much this is the second-best movie of the series to have ""Predator"" in the title. Its solidly entertaining for what it is and while it does little to truly rejuvenate the franchise at least it lessens the pain caused by two gimmicky cross-over pictures that sucked too much juice out of what was one of the 1980s most surprisingly tense sci-fi action pictures.

(20th Century Fox) Joe Neumaier Thursday July 8 2010 150 PM Title Predators First the predators came for Arnold Schwarzenegger in Venezuela and audiences lapped it up. Then they came for Danny Glover in L.A. and audiences yawned. Then they came for the ""Alien"" franchise and there were yawns mixed with geek-boy cheers. Now theyve come for Oscar winners and nominees and the result is just another loud thuddingly plotted would-be blockbuster.""Predators"" tries to spice up the hunt-or-be-hunted thesis but from the get-go director Nimrod Antals movie has nowhere to run. The assembled confused characters forced to play the most dangerous game even make a veiled ""Lost"" joke which isnt nearly as self-referential as the opening shot of star Adrien Brody in free fall.Brody plays one of eight tough humans plucked from Earth and dropped - after the predators thoughtfully put parachutes on them - into an interstellar game preserve.Theyre for the most part nameless identified by their nationality and job. Brody is an American mercenary and the de facto leader; theres also a steely South American female soldier (Alice Braga) a brutish Mexican drug cartel leader (Danny Trejo) a brawny Sierra Leone fighter a nasty ex-Death Row inmate a mysterious Japanese swordsman and a weaselly doctor (Topher Grace) whose reason for being there is the storys silliest twist.Luckily one of them saw the 1987 original so they can describe whats up to the others Otherworldly beasties with cloaking devices clam-fangs and Rastafarian dreads hunt other species for sport. Survival is impossible though the troop meets a nutso survivor (Laurence Fishburne) from a previous hunting season. But even he cant stop them from being picked off by the predators or their horned dino-dogs.Antal - who had fun with claustrophobic action in 2003s ""Kontroll"" - lets audiences get lost here in the dense forest thankfully avoiding the tired tradition of making each kill more elaborate than the last. And the big sell of these movies remains the snarly title villains and their sophisticated invisibility technology who nonetheless dont mind setting up a good old-fashioned bear trap. Their hide-and-seek appearances still send a shiver.But despite the plural this isnt a monster-palooza like ""Aliens""; the slayers here are merely a three-man-band. As for the humans Brody now apparently in the monster-film phase of his career after winning an Oscar amps up the brawniness to comical effect. Only Fishburne is having any fun turning his big scene into a loony trip to the heart of darkness.

"Predators review Rebooted sci-fi series is a pure popcorn delight |       NJ.com comments Predators review Rebooted sci-fi series is a pure popcorn delight Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 09 2010 at 1213 AM View/Post Comments photos by Rico Torres/ 20th Century Fox/MCTAdrien Brody portrays a mercenary and Alice Braga above right is a military sniper whose skills are put to the ultimate test when they face killer aliens in ""Predators.""A disparate group of strangers suddenly find themselves marooned at a mysterious deceptively beautiful location. Is this all a coincidence? Is there some larger force at work? ""Were all dead"" one guesses. ""Hell"" another suggests. A ""Lost"" rerun I think. Well no. Were all wrong. Where we are is at the beginning of a brand-new ""Predator"" movie that stands as both a sequel in the sci-fi series and a stand-alone action picture. And its silly bloody fun. The 1987 original started out like a rumble-in-the-jungle actioner with two future governors -- Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura -- on a secret mission in Latin America. Then suddenly a human-hunting alien showed up. And we were in a whole other kind of movie. Fox has been a studio thats always liked its franchises perhaps a case of lingering ""Doh"" after letting George Lucas keep a certain movies sequel rights. So soon there was a line of ""Predator"" follow-ups ending in ""Aliens Vs. Predator Requiem."" And as every genre fan knows that ""Vs."" in a title is always a sign of desperation. By the time you have to add a second monster to the marquee your series is pretty much done.Movie Review Predators (R) Fox (107 min.) Directed by Nimrod Antal. With Adrien Brody Topher Grace Alice Braga. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys review THREE STARS The new film though smartly takes a different tack drastically rethinking the old elements. For example instead of Schwarzenegger and Ventura we now get Adrien Brody and Topher Grace. Yes that drastically. Its in keeping though with the action-movie trend to bypass big muscle-bound stars in favor of someone who looks like he crewed on the high-school musical. That way goes the thinking well more easily identify with their problems. Even if their problem is running around a jungle planet hiding from 7-foot alien sportsmen. The gimmick here is that the human prey was predators on earth. Brody for example was a mercenary. Danny Trejo was muscle for a drug cartel. Alice Braga was a military sniper. Theyre used to dealing out death and theyre determined to give the aliens as good as they get. Director Nimrod Antal -- who made the fun thriller ""Vacancy"" and the overlooked robbery picture ""Armored"" -- keeps things fast and focused. The many action sequences are well-photographed and cleanly edited and the performances are mostly kept in check. Well mostly. Laurence Fishburne -- who is beginning to assume the self-satisfied bulk of Geoffrey Holder -- nibbles on some of the scenery as a Robinson Crusoe-type. Walton Goggins plays a psycho-killer character with a little too much relish. And there are a few letdowns like an extraterrestrial sky that looks cheesier than an old studio matte painting and some tweaking of the backstory (apparently there are bad aliens and even badder aliens) that only serves as a distraction. But for fans of creature effects samurai sword fights major fireballs gory death scenes -- and B movies with B+ budgets -- ""Predators"" is a solid popcorn treat taking an old franchise and pumping it full of new neon-green blood.

Predators Bad to fair Director Nimrod Antal. Cast Adrien Brody Alice Braga Walton Goggins. Rating Rated R for strong creature violence and gore and pervasive language. RELATED Bulking up for a movie role Kick-butt chicks Sci-fi horror Spotlight Adrien Brody Spotlight Laurence Fishburne Off with their shirts Unfortunately it lasts 106. A sort-of sequel to the 1987 ""Predator"" it blasts out of the gate; the first thing we see is Adrien Brodys character unconscious plummeting through the sky. Will he awaken in time to figure out how to pull his parachute cord? (Hint He receives top billing in the movie.) Soon others drop from the clouds into the middle of a thick jungle with no idea why theyre there. But they have this in common Theyre all bad-asses of the first order. Royce (Brody) is a mercenary; Isabelle (Alice Braga) is an Israeli assassin; Stans (Walton Goggins) is a death-row inmate practically on his way to the chair; Cuchillo (Danny Trejo) last remembers fighting drug wars in Baja; Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) is part of a Sierre Leone death squad; Nikoli (Oleg Taktarov) is a Russian special-forces fighter; Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) an Asian mob enforcer. Only Edwin (Topher Grace) a doctor seems out of place in this bunch. Dont bother getting to know them too well. In a movie like this you know going in that a good percentage will simply be fodder. There is much posturing of course and fighting among them - they might not know exactly why they were chosen to be dumped here but they do know it wasnt because they work and play well with others. But Royce who emerges as the brains of the operation figures out that they are in a game preserve and theyre the game. Theyre being hunted by - this is not a spoiler alert really if you look at the title of the movie before you buy your ticket - predators. Mean ones aliens who can cloak themselves in invisibility and find their prey with heat-sensitive vision which doesnt seem all that sporting but then again neither do duck calls when you get right down to it. Plus there are two kinds of predators bad ones and worse ones who also hunt each other - who are we supposed to pull for in that fight? We learn this because for some reason director Nimrod Antal after some pretty terrific adrenaline-soaked sequences in which the predators are slowly revealed decides to slow things down for a while so that crazy Noland (Laurence Fishburne) who has survived these hunts before can explain things in cryptic fashion. The film loses momentum at that point and never regains it. Its similar to seeing a classic-rock band play hit after hit then announce ""OK were going to slow it down with some new stuff."" Two words bathroom break. Antal cant really crank up the excitement to the same level after that. There are also bizarre inconsistencies such as when one of these savage soulless killing machines decides after catching up with Hanzo to stop and have an honorable sword fight. With a trained ninja. Is it more sporting? Was he bored? There are echoes of the original here even a specific reference to a previous incident in 1987 in Guatemala. Alas there are no Arnold Schwarzenegger sightings which would have been kind of cool. Brody is a different kind of action hero of course (though hes bulked up noticeably). Goggins is always fun to watch when he is in demented psycho mode which is often and always in this case. Grace has turned into a reliable performer and hes the only one here who really does what you would think of as ""acting"" (as opposed to ""screaming""). ""Predators"" is in the end a pretty fun ride. Until its not. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

But what starts with so much promise and intrigue devolves into a more predictable cat- and-mouse game. The fascination wears off as the initial premise never becomes fleshed out and plot holes loom larger than the monstrous mayhem. Billed as a new chapter in the Predator series that began in 1987 this fifth installment blends the commando scenario with sci-fi elements from the first film which starred the now-governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. A character here even alludes to the first adventure in which a team of soldiers on a mission in Central America was hunted by an alien force.

They quickly determine that theyre being hunted but dont know who is pursuing them or why. Adrien Brody emerges as the unofficial leader of the pack a mercenary with an intuitive grasp of the situation. ""This place is a game preserve and were the game"" he tells his cohorts. Alice Braga plays an Army sniper uniquely familiar with jungle fighting. She is the only one of the crew who does any soul-searching to figure out why this particular group was chosen as prey. The rest of the corps are trained soldiers of varying stripes One is a surly convict wanted by the FBI (Walton Goggins) another is a drug gang enforcer (Danny Trejo) and the least likely member is a mild-mannered doctor (Topher Grace). Grace and Brody deliver some of the funniest dialogue. Laurence Fishburne plays a recluse who has escaped the clutches of the predators physically if not mentally. When the group attempts to escape they reach a critical precipice. The sight of a pair of large planets looming in the horizon is breathtaking and were right there with them disoriented and in awe. But the story loses its potency as danger crops up behind every overgrown tree. The characters ultimately seem like cardboard cutouts. And once we lay eyes on the toothy dreadlocked aliens hunting this multicultural assortment of castaways the tension of the first half-hour falters. Even so the special effects that allow the creatures to appear and disappear are deftly rendered. Their unique ability to home in on their prey is also cleverly portrayed. This version is still better than any other Predator sequel. But it could have been so much better settling for forced surprises that may come out of nowhere but dont seem to go anywhere.

"Predators review Adrien Brody action hero | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPredators review Adrien Brody action heroA 2010 reboot of the original with twice the slime splatter special effects and swearing and worth every penny for popcorn-munching moviegoers.Adrien Brody and Alice Braga dip into their ample cache of weaponry.  (Rico Torres / AP)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. July 8 2010Predators(out of 4)Starring Adrien Brody Topher Grace Alice Braga and Laurence Fishburne. Directed by Nimrod Antal. 108 minutes. At the Elgin Mills 10 Interchange. 14AThe term ""Adrien Brody action hero"" may not roll off the tongue. But here he is in Predators reprising Arnold Schwarzeneggers tough guy role as he does battle with alien human hunters right down to the mud-smeared six-pack and darned if he doesnt pull it off.Directed by Nimrod Antal Predators is clearly orchestrated by Robert Rodriguez who gets an above-the-title credit for bringing you this craptastic example of high-concept B-movie excess. It never pretends to be anything more than it is a 2010 reboot of the original with twice the slime splatter special effects and swearing and worth every penny for popcorn-munching moviegoers who want to indulge in some outer space horror excess.Article Continued BelowThe Ship of Fools-style cast finds themselves dropped from the sky into a remote jungle after being plucked from their former lives. Armed to the teeth with gigantic laserscope rifles Samurai swords and knives the size of French baguettes they seem to have nothing in common but their facility for killing. Bad asses all they include soldiers of fortune a convict Yazuka gang member and a Mexican drug cartel enforcer. The odd man out is a nerdy doctor named Edwin (Topher Grace) but he has his uses eventually.Their de facto leader by virtue of the fact he whisper-talks like Clint Eastwood and has the biggest gun is taciturn Royce (Brody). He has no time for making nice or forming bonds. When he does speak he uses the clipped sentences and howlingly bad dialogue thats the hallmark of monster horror flicks. And then he quotes Hemingway. The guys a B-movie classic.Pretty soon it becomes clear theyve been dumped on a giant interstellar game preserve for the hunting sport of the same race of trophy-taking Predators we first met in the 1987 original visual effects whiz Stan Winstons dreadlocked aliens with insect mandibles who can track humans via infrared sensors before they start ripping out spinal columns. Yee-hawTheyre here because they so callously hunted fellow human beings in life reasons Israeli army sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga) a dab hand with a rifle and the grudging conscience of the group.Writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch have steered clear of the truly awful Aliens vs. Predator spinoffs to get us back to the good stuff taking the tough guys and girl onto the hunters home turf. And Antal does a good job of upping the tension even if a pack of shakily CGI-produced alien hell hounds fail to deliver appropriate scares.But all is forgiven when Laurence Fishburne shows up for a wonderfully over-the-top but too-brief cameo as a stranded soldier whos gone doolally. The blood (human red and Predator green) flows in rivers and there are plenty of appropriately icky jungle sounds especially when the gang stumbles on the Predator version of a good ole boy hunting camp.Hardly a message film (unless you count ""run"" as a message) the often-predictable plot includes a nice twist in the final act and Antal leaves the door wide open for a sequel which is good news for fans of the genre. But please dont invite the Alien to the party.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Predators"" is B-movie Nirvana a dark serious take on a minor science-fiction classic that respects the qualities that made it a cable-rerun favorite. Its got plot performances production values great casting and tautly choreographed action. Fanboys will jump foursquare upon this movie rolling around barking in delight and waving their collective paws in the air. Thats me over there third from the left. Producer by Robert (""Sin City"") Rodriguez who took a pass at reviving the franchise some years back and directed by Nimrod Antal the film assaults viewers (in a good way) from Frame 1. You know youre off to a good start when the movie begins with an unconscious Adrien Brody plummeting through clouds while the alarm wired to his undeployed parachute blares its warning impact imminent. That desperate situation is nothing compared with what awaits him on the ground. Brody has landed in a dense jungle with odd trees and downright bizarre animal life. His companions are a whos who of bad-assery a Mexican gangbanger a silent Yakuza a Russian infantryman a sociopath on the FBIs Most Wanted List a sultry South American sniper plus assorted stone-cold killers armed and dangerous. They all remember a bright light blinding them while they went about their daily death-dealing then free-fall. After a bit of theological conjecture (""Were dead."" ""This is Hell."" ""We deserve to be here."") realization dawns. Theyre in an alien hunting preserve and its open season on humans. Our heroes are a colorful bunch. Brody who usually portrays pensive wounded-looking types is reborn here as a hard-as-nails no-mercy mercenary. Unbelievably it works. Lowering his voice to a take-charge rumble and sporting a Ramboesque new physique Brody is the thinking mans Sgt. Rock. With a clever nod to the first Predator film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger CIA sharpshooter Alicia Braga provides background on the groups reptilian adversaries detailing their fearsome capabilities (infrared vision laser weapons invisibility cloaks and the rest). Topher Grace is the groups Nervous Nellie a panicky doctor with only a scalpel for a weapon. Louis Ozawa Changchien the tight-lipped Japanese mobster is as imposing in stillness as he is fluid in action; Antal gives him a samurai sword sequence in waving grass that is positively elegant. Its a welcome respite in a propulsive film that puts audiences through a dozen white-knuckle rounds of the seat-squirm tango. The Predators like to play with their prey and Antal does the same with viewers. He wrings gorgeous tension out of the rain forest setting and light-starved confined techno-caves where the characters take shelter. His framing suggests that theres always something dreadful lurking around the corner and it doesnt pounce until the point of total nervous collapse. He knows when exhilarating action should yield to terrifying silence or intimate bonding between partners in havoc. PREDATORS  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong creature violence and gore and pervasive language. The stakes rise as these alpha male killers (and the strong female) jockey for position moral codes are tested and survival becomes the ultimate value. The script asks whether staying alive at all costs is worth the price. The film wisely keeps a couple of trump cards hidden with character reversals and a cameo by an A-list actor that torques the tension still higher. Its as if Marlon Brandos Col. Kurtz from ""Apocalypse Now"" dropped by to contribute a crazed monologue another weird grace note in a smart assured film that raises sci-fi survivalism to the level of existential struggle.

And were the game.""Da-da-dadam . . .So announces Adrien Brody in Predators helmer NimrA3d Antals resurrection of the Arnold Schwarzenegger-Jesse Ventura-starring minor B-classic Predator.And yes the score actually swells up and crashes into an emphatic da-da-dadam that ol standby only soap operas still use.A preposterous if admittedly fun exercise in sci-fi/horror mayhem Predators is about eight tough hombres from around the world who are suddenly dropped (literally) on a planet far far away.Theyve been especially selected as top-grade prey for a hunt organized by those nasty fluorescent-lime-green-blooded Predator aliens who look like a cross of a miniature Godzilla a catfish and a dreadlocked ganja-smoking reggae singer.The evildoers easily slice and dice their way through our gang which includes a Russian Spetsnaz soldier (Oleg Taktarov); a Mexican drug cartel enforcer (Danny Trejo); a Yakuza killer (Louis Ozawa Changchien); and a racist rapist-murderer on death row (Walton Goggins in a reprise of his redneck role in Justified).Alice Braga who survived the first Predator rounds out the baaad-boy picnic as Isabelle a beautiful sniper from the Israel Defense Forces.Youd expect such a sweet mix of actors to generate some chemistry - perhaps engage in some Tarantino-esque banter. Sadly theres very little. Mostly we get stupid one-liners about survival and the hunter-hunted dialectic.Brody isnt bad as a tough guy. But he looks out of place It seems as if he Methoded his way into his role as a Hemingway-quoting (I kid you not) mercenary named Royce by watching 1940s film noirs spaghetti westerns and Dirty Harry. You keep expecting him to walk into a dimly lit bar light a cigarette and chat up a fatal sexy redhead.Laurence Fishburne makes a brief cameo as Noland a spaced-out soldier with an imaginary friend. The Apocalypse Now star tells our motley band hes from the Air Cavalry then bellows out a few notes of Wagners ""Ride of the Valkyries."" (Guess he was beamed down from one of Robert Duvalls helicopters.)The first third of the film is a real drag. But it picks up - and how - once the clutter (read supporting cast) is thinned out. The action is fierce well-choreographed and bloody.Predator purists (is that an oxymoron?) have nothing to fear This is a worthy follow-up. And if the fate of the original stars is any indication Brody and Fishburne have a gubernatorial future.Contact staff writer Tirdad Derakhshani at 215-854-2736 or tirdadphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Having already logged two features two Alien crossovers and countless novels videogames and comic-book spin-offs the Predator franchise has been recycled and re-imagined more times than its thin premise of alien hunters would seem capable of withstanding. So credit Predators the latest reboot for devising an appropriately ridiculous (and irresistibly pulpy) hook Rather than having the aliens come to Earth and murder humans for sport the most vicious warriors on our planet--mercenaries a yakuza a death-row inmate etc.--have been exported to theirs. Call it The Most Dangerous-est Game. The greatest hunters are now the greatest huntees reduced to dangerous quarry for a superior species to pick off and bungee to their truck beds. Its just a pity that Predators fails to recognize its own patent absurdity. The opening shot finds grizzled black-ops loner Adrien Brody tumbling from the sky regaining consciousness just in time to parachute to safety. He doesnt know where he is or how he got there and other mystified agents of death soon join him including veterans from various war zones (Alice Braga Danny Trejo Oleg Taktarov Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) a crisply dressed yakuza (Louis Ozawa Changchien) a criminal (Walton Goggins) and a doctor (Topher Grace) whose purpose isnt immediately apparent. They spend much of the movie figuring out what the audience already knows all while fending off an enemy thats stronger stealthier and has home-field advantage. Of the formidable cast only Goggins seems to be having any fun as he applies his bad-guy charisma from The Shield and Justified to a gleefully unrepentant monster. But director Nimrod Antal and writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch treat this piece of fanfic juvenilia with gravity that it doesnt begin to merit with Brody doing his best Christian Bale impersonation as the burdened gravel-voiced anti-hero. Since leaving Hungary for Hollywood after his insta-cult favorite Kontroll Antal has shown a facility for doing solid work in various genres including horror (Vacancy) and heist (Armored) movies. But after so many iterations in every possible medium the Predator series needed a shot of vitality not another workmanlike go-around. SSDP Same shit different planet.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + I know what youre thinking. The sight of Adrien Brody waking up to find himself plummeting from the sky in the opening scene of ""Predators is all too apt a career metaphor. How did a young star who seemed destined to save serious acting turn into another action figure? Who cares? Where do I get my hands on one?Brody looks a bit like the muscled vaguely human reptiles hunting him down except hes all Eastwood Heston and Stallone too -- hilariously humorlessly macho. It didnt seem like there was an American under 40 in the movie business capable of being persuasively masculine without a twitch of irony or pleading. Weve been importing that guy from Scotland and Australia and Pandora But Brody makes an entertaining case for some kind of embargo.He crashes down in a jungle. Seconds later so do a few more bewildered heavily armed actors -- its Danny Trejo And Alice Braga And some Russian dude -- and a pile of limbs whose parachute failed to open. Soon eight strangers including a Sierra Leonean (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) a death-row hick (Walton Goggins) a natty Yakuza (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and an American doctor (Topher Grace armed with only his sarcasm) are trying to figure out precisely where they are. (By the way Oleg Taktarov plays the Russian.) An awed gander at the planetarium-load of objects hanging in the heavens raises an important question What is going on? (Its better asked with expletives the way our strangers do.)Gradually the characters give us a few helpful hints and the wonderfully steely Braga playing a Latin American guerrilla rehashes the plot of ""Predator that 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger hit to which this movie is a kind of alternative sequel to the installments that followed. Her recitation sounds like combat lore. But again I know what youre thinking Didnt this show just end two months ago? Yes ""Predators with its tropical mystery; sweaty confused cast; and no exit is ""Lost on the one hand. On another its also ""Saw III. And on yet another -- work with me people; have you seen the creatures doing the hunting here? -- it becomes ""Rambo ""Aliens and ""Avatar. Crucially however its a little bit Jean-Paul Sartre as well Hell is other people -- and the monsters chasing you down.The assembled characters have been dropped into this jungle from the scenes of their respective crimes -- death squads genocide etc. Despite their military trappings -- more often because of them -- theyre not terribly humane people and their appearance among such relentless quasi-human monsters seems like a punishment for their own moral transgressions. Its a clever idea that the writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch are smart not to overplay.The fun-addict director Robert Rodriguez produced ""Predators so accordingly it also flirts with too-muchness in a good way. Just when it looked as if Brody couldnt be better or more authoritative a more robustly stentorian thespian arrives after halftime to add perspective to Brodys masculinity. I wont name the actor although the ads dont treat it as much of a secret. But it was a surprise to me all the same. His sense of leadership is captivating and later so is his derangement which creates more allusions namely to Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now. Those mourning ""Lost will find this characters description of his stay in this jungle intriguingly cosmic. How long has he been there? ""Seven seasons I think -- but possibly as many as 10 he says. Dude ""Lost ended after six. Holy crypto-spinoffThe director of ""Predators is Nimrod Antal whose B-movies -- ""Kontroll ""Vacancy ""Armored -- refuse to settle for the free 200 points awarded for filling in ones name. Hes a skilled moviemaker who understands the cumulative power of withholding. A good thriller is a striptease and Antal respects the art of peeling away layers. He uses his camera (Gyula Pados is the cinematographer) to draw you in instead of leaning on editing blitzes to spell everything out the way 90 percent of this ilk of horror-action-comedy does.When Brody gives his castmates a cautionary speech -- ""we run we die he warns -- the camera drifts in for a medium close-up that demands to be taken seriously. As you watch bodies tumble down a hill and into a lake theres even an urge to applaud the brutality of the stunt work. (Looked real to me.) Antal is a professional who respects your dollars. In a season where the blockbusters are as flat as month-old soda thats the most romantic gesture a commercial filmmaker can make.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Predators (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Predators (R) Predators is a dumb action movie in a summer full of dumb movies and yet its always entertaining. And you wont really miss Arnold at all. Royce (Adrien Brody left) and Isabelle (Alice Braga) take aim during their desperate battle against the alien Predators in 20th Century Foxs science/fiction horror ""Predators."" (Rico Torres/Courtesy 20th Century Fox/MCT) Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald7/7/2010 Editor rating 2 There are not quite so many muscles on display in this sort-of sequel to John McTiernans 1987 classic Predator -- although there are some and you will not forget them. There are no future governors amid the sweaty jungle action (unless Topher Grace makes a run for office and whos to say he wont?). There is however spinal-cord gouging a device that almost makes up for how little you care what happens to the characters. Predators makes a brief reference to the earlier film which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura as commandos on a mission in Central America who find themselves hunted by a powerful extraterrestrial warrior. (There was a Predator 2 but the less said about it the better. Also forget those Alien vs. Predator movies; you may spot an alien skull or two amid the wreckage but those films are largely irrelevant.) Predators offers a more premeditated Greatest Hits-type deal Someone has assembled a group of killers -- from the military Special Ops Chechnya Death Row a drug cartel an African death squad the yakuza the medical profession -- and dumped them on what appears to be another planet as prey for the bloodthirsty aliens. The whole set-up is reminiscent of TVs Lost only without the repetitive flashbacks and time travel and overall the Predators cast isnt quite so pretty. Adrien Brody of all people plays the defacto leader of the motley group -- hes the Special-Ops guy a heartless mercenary destined to show us that he does in fact have a soul but probably not until the end of the movie. The Oscar winner (for Roman Polanskis The Pianist) has no business being this good as an action hero and yet theres never a moment when hes less than believable. Predators boasts a more talented cast overall than the original movie had including Walton Goggins (The Shield Justified) Alice Braga (Repo Men I Am Legend) and the aforementioned Grace (who plays the doctor in case you were wondering if he were the guy on the African death squad). They all help keep the goofy improbable plot spinning though one could make a compelling case that half the fun of the first movie is laughing at the bad acting. Little happens that you dont see coming down to which cast members will get picked off and in what order. Its a dumb action movie in a summer full of dumb movies and yet its always entertaining. And you wont really miss Arnold at all. Cast Adrien Brody Topher Grace Alice Braga Walton Goggins Laurence Fishburne. Director Nimrod Antal. Screenwriters Alex Litvak Michael Finch Jim Thomas John Thomas. Producers Elizabeth Avellan John Davis Robert Rodriguez. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 106 minutes. Violence gore language.

Now 23 years later comes Predators an entirely unnecessary new installment in the sci-fi splatter cycle directed by Vacancys Nimrod Antal from an ancient Robert Rodriguez script that Fox should have left in mothballs. Heres the set-up A nasty bunch of criminals mercenaries and Yakuza types get shipped off to a distant planet only to find out that theyre human prey for everybodys favorite dreadlocked pincer-faced spinal cord-extracting beasties. Think of it as Avatar with more gore a lot less wit and Adrien Brody (and his Situation-like abs) as the alpha-male leader of a doomed pack of tough guys gruffly barking orders as he tries to get inside the mind of you know who. Topher Grace does his signature smart-ass quipster thing Alice Braga is the tough chick with a big heart and Laurence Fishburne drops by to lend the film its only bit of unpredictable fun as a loco Kurtz-like soldier of fortune whos gone native. These arent characters theyre cardboard cliches lining up for the body count. As a fan of Schwarzeneggers macho heart-of-darkness original it gives me no pleasure to say that Predators is an uninspired mess of mediocre action scenes strung together until the final reel. But it gives me even less pleasure to add that that final reel leaves room for a sequel. The horror.

Forget the official sequel and the lame Alien vs Predator spin-offs this Predator sequel deserves one of its own. Armed to the teeth but unknown to one another a multiracial group of military/criminal killers (plus Topher Graces anomalous wimpy doctor) find themselves on a Predator hunting planet where they are the game. Faced with an evolved  generation of super-Predators Adrien Brodys Hemingway-quoting self-appointed leader (""There is no hunting like the hunting of men . . . "") insists that their survival depends upon pooling their own killer instincts. Alice Bragas svelte sniper is a tough yet tender foil for the buff brainy Brody; with one notable exception the remaining dirty half-dozen are merely disposable. Channelling Brandos unhinged Colonel Kurtz a well-padded Laurence Fishburne pops up halfway through as a surprise sole survivor a striking cameo that nods to his youthful debut in Apocalypse Now.

The director had me from the first scene and I really enjoyed the film. The characters leave a lot to desire though and the ending could be better. The problem with the characters is that they are for the most part very unlikable people and so when they are hunted you dont care very whether they get killed or not. If they were more sympathetic people the tension would probably be greater. The reviewer describes the characters as ""military/criminal killers"" as if the two are one and the same. That sentence is ridiculous and extremely annoying.
