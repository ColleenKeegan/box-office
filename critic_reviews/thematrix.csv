Unleashing two film sequels and altering the course of Keanu Reeves career The Matrix made its U.S. theatrical debut on March 31 1999. Days earlier The Hollywood Reporter appraised the title predicting box-office glory for the film. Read the original review below A cyber sci-fi blowout of wetware-boggling visual effects and advanced comic book storytelling Warner Bros. The Matrix will open mightily and have a wide-open month to become early 1999s biggest hit. Word-of-mouth will be giddy with young and mature males lining up for a technologically stunning movie that furthers the genre and features crowd-pleasing performances to go with the frequent scenes of gunplay and violence. Kudos to the writing and directing team of Larry and Andy Wachowski -- who debuted impressively with the small-scale tightly wound Bound -- for fashioning a brain-twisting eye-popping thriller that recalls The Terminator Total Recall and Stanislaw Lems great novel The Futurological Congress. The lead character played by Keanu Reeves discovers that everyday reality is a computer-created illusion and that future humans are locked in an epic struggle with intelligent machines. Opening with an explosive sequence in which a leather-clad woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) with amazing leaping and fighting abilities is chased by cops and scary men in suits Matrix is an adrenaline rush from the start and pushes the envelope in stylish inspired action sequences. But the characters are not forgotten or secondary and many of the best moments belong to the actors. A loner with a cyber-identity Neo (Reeves) lives in a metropolis of the near future and through Trinity hes warned that ""they"" are after him. ""They"" are the men in suits led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) who nab defiant but naive Neo at his work and insert a metallic bug in him hoping he will lead them to the mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). But Morpheus and his comrades get to him swiftly remove the bug and offer Neo the chance to join them though by the nature of the situation he doesnt know what awaits him. Speaking cryptically about the ""truth"" Morpheus says he must choose to take a journey like Lewis Carrolls Alice one with irreversible consequences to his understanding of reality. So Neo takes the plunge and the movie takes a big leap conceptually when its revealed that the story is actually taking place hundreds of years from now when humans have lost a globally catastrophic war against machines created by artificial intelligence programs run amok. Vat-bound humans are bred by the machines to provide power with each ""battery"" hooked up to the Matrix a virtual construct that resembles Earth as we more or less know it. Morpheus Trinity and Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) are rebels who have unplugged themselves from the Matrix and sought out Neo because ""hes the one"" prophesied by the ""oracle."" Neo might just be able to defeat the machines. Absorbing when it isnt going a little overboard -- like it does during a John Woo-like gun battle in a lobby -- Matrix has several super kung fu sequences including use of Hong Kong-style wirestunt work and what the Wachowskis have dubbed ""bullet-time photography"" or ""Flow-Mo"" an awesome physics-defying effect inspired by Japanese anime. Reeves is good as the somewhat fragile but adaptable hero. Fishburne is savvy casting as Neos guide and protector and Moss and Pantoliano also are impressive. But the big scene stealer is Weaving as the relentless opponent and embodiment of the Matrixs creators. His deadpan delivery and ultra-serious demeanor is chipped away with growing frustration and the Australian contributes much of the films nervous humor. --David Hunter FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS THR Staff THRnewsthr.com thr Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter (c) 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski. Alderwood Auburn Cinema 17 Crossroads East Valley 13 Everett Mall 1-3 Factoria Gateway Issaquah 9 Kent 6 Kirkland Parkplace Mountlake 9 Neptune Northgate Redmond Town Centre Southcenter South Hill Mall Woodinville 12. 120 minutes. ""R"" - Restricted because of violence profanity and gore. Extremely violent extremely preposterous extremely entertaining ""The Matrix"" succeeds at two extremely difficult tasks as a vast exciting virtual-reality movie and as a defibrillator for Keanu Reeves big screen career. Using the pantheon of movie iconography from the past 100 years - from ""High Noon"" showdowns to bad kung fu to loves first kiss - the writing/directing team of the Wachowski brothers Larry and Andy achieves a fantastic hodgepodge symmetry using hacker noir comedy and mindless action. Thomas Anderson (Reeves) is a talented computer programmer at a monolithic corporation during the day but at night hes an unscrupulous hacker tagged Neo. His work brings him to the attention of Morpheus (Fishburne) a mysterious stranger who tantalizes Neo. Morpheus compares him to Lewis Carrolls Alice with talk of other worlds and realities. He offers Neo two pills a blue one which will allow things to continue on as they have and a red one which purportedly will lift the veil from his eyes and allow him to see ""how deep the rabbit hole goes."" This being a movie and since the plot would pretty much stop here if he didnt Neo takes the red one. When the veil does lift its Kafka meets ""Die Hard"" and Neo realizes the awful truth that Morpheus has wanted him to see. Its a truth darker than ""Dark City"" more memorable than ""Johnny Mnemonic"" and as terminal as ""The Terminator."" Its bad for him but its good for us. The most critical aspect of this films success is the creation of the Matrix world a simulacrum of reality where most of the people in this film work fight and die. The Wachowskis set up certain rules for this reality and try to stick to them - thus making the realm as important as the ""real"" world. Of course they also have a lot of fun working within their construct. Visitors to the world are faster than the other inhabitants and they can jump incredible distances. But they can still be hurt even be killed especially if they are attacked by the officious Matrix agents who prowl the streets. Reeves who in the past has been accused of being kind of a virtual-reality effect himself acquits himself nicely as Neo. The long lingering stench of ""Johnny Mnemonic"" dissipates in the first few moments of the film. Actually it isnt dissipated its blown away with the exhilarating opening fight sequence. Its a desperate chase between Trinity (a Sigourney Weaver career jump-starter role for Carrie-Anne Moss) and the Matrix agents. Giving life to a monotone character Hugo Weaving brings a repulsed humanity to the main regimented baddie Agent Smith. Like any great movie villain hes a worthy opponent. Its evident that the Wachowski brothers (whose last effort was the erotic cranker ""Bound"") brought something extra to the table. Someone elses treatment of their script could have turned into a ponderous gorgeous somber affair like ""Dark City."" In fact ""The Matrix"" so closely parallels the story line of ""Dark City"" that it makes the brothers contributions stick out like an enormous sore virtual-reality thumb. Most hacker noir films seem to vie for the ""Blade Runner"" production design award entirely forgetting their audience and their story. Not the Wachowskis. Theyre like little kids playing with blocks building and constructing. Then they use the wow-filled ""Flo-mo"" and ""bullet time"" special effects of Jon Gaeta and the designs of Owen Paterson to knock those blocks down. And knock they do demolishing the wall between the standard ""question reality"" movie and an action film. When the dust settles ""The Matrix"" is all thats left standing.

"An Easter Parade - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs An Easter ParadeIts Tangled In Allusions But Its Fun To WatchMarch 31 1999|By Mark Caro Tribune Movie Writer.Brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski are building themselves quite an odd little resume. Their first film credit was for co-writing the critically reviled Sylvester Stallone/Antonio Banderas dum-dum action film ""Assassins."" Next came their joint writing-directing debut ""Bound"" a 1996 indie hit and the ultimate guy flick It worked a steamy lesbian relationship (between Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly) into a violent smartly plotted mob doublecross story.From the look of it youd never guess that the makers of ""Bound"" would have anything to do with ""The Matrix"" an extravagantly designed futuristic thriller starring Keanu Reeves as a possible savior. Whereas ""Bound"" is driven by intimate interactions ""The Matrix"" is more about finding a place for humans amid overwhelming visuals and big ideas such as What Is Reality?At times you think the Chicago-raised brothers have bitten off more than they can chew. They wrote ""The Matrix"" before ""Bound"" and it has the feel of a story concocted by younger minds not yet wary of overreaching.The concept is an engaging one A computer-savvy young man nicknamed Neo (Reeves) is recruited by a group of seemingly superhumans to thwart a conspiracy that keeps the worlds population living in a virtual reality -- that is people dont realize that their entire environment apparently is electronically generated.Sinister computers are involved in perpetrating the false world and a group of male ""agents"" dressed in gray suits and sporting sleek shades are the enforcers. Carrying the flag for true reality are the mythical leader Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and a stoic tremendously agile woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). They think Neo is ""The One"" -- the trump card for the forces of good.The storys riffs on artificial intelligence and electronically created environments feel timely yet many of the ideas arent so new. ""Total Recall"" among other science-fiction works similarly explored the intersection of physical and mental landscapes the ""Terminator"" movies previously envisioned a time-spanning man-versus-machine battleground and Neos training as a possibly predestined hero is reminiscent of a certain Jedi knight.The Wachowski brothers also enjoy drawing overt parallels to the adventures of Lewis Carrolls Alice -- both in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass which in this case is a liquid mirror. At one point Neo must choose to swallow either a blue or red pill one to return him to lifes illusions and the other to send him exploring beneath the surface.""Buckle your seatbelt Dorothy because Kansas is going bye-bye"" warns a character named Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) begging the question of whether merging Wonderland and Oz constitutes a mixed metaphor.Yet if the storytelling occasionally gets too wrapped up in its tangle of mythical allusions and abstract concepts the movie remains fun to watch. The Wachowskis and cinematographer Bill Pope take advantage of currently available technical trickery to create visually distinct levels of reality while setting high-speed cameras in motion to make the action sequences particularly dynamic and fluid.(Although ""The Matrix"" was filmed in Sydney the Wachowskis fill it with Chicago geographical references such as the State and Balbo subway station. ""Bound"" also took place in Chicago but was filmed in Los Angeles.)Neo enjoys the perk of downloading various martial arts into his head and the fights are conducted Hong Kong style with the combatants flying around on invisible wires. Also exciting is a sequence in which Neo chased by agents through the gray cubicles of his workplace is guided via cell phone by the seemingly omniscient Morpheus who knows just what moment Neo should turn or head out to the window ledge.Theres something about Reeves boyishly handsome sweetly blank looks that encourage filmmakers to envision him as a higher-plane human. He has already played Bernardo Bertoluccis Siddhartha in ""Little Buddha"" as well as Satans chief recruit in ""The Devils Advocate"" and his noggin was a vessel for much downloaded information in the woeful ""Johnny Mnemonic."" Neo isnt much of a stretch for him yet he plays the athletic innocent with enough credibility and appeal to keep us on his side.Moss best known for television work in series such as ""Models Inc."" and ""Due South"" is more of a surprise a quiet yet commanding presence perhaps because her face actually reveals some age and thus character and sex appeal. Whoever performs and choreographs her stunt work deserves credit as well; Trinitys best move is a dive into a buildings open window down a flight of stairs and into a somersault that ends with her pointing her gun at her pursuers.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesMore is lessMay 14 2003`Matrix Reloaded entwines strands from many faithsJuly 2 2003The Plot ThickensApril 15 1999Chicago roots show in MatrixMay 12 2003Find More Stories AboutBoundMatrixJediEaster ParadeTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-31/features/9903310365_1_neo-matrix-bound,200,thematrix2,thematrix,chicagotribune

Its Special Effects 10 Screenplay 0 for ""The Matrix"" an eye-popping but incoherent extravaganza of morphing and superhuman martial arts. Ultra-cool visuals that truly deliver something new to the sci-fi action lexicon will make this time-jumping thriller a must-see among genre fans especially guys in their teens and 20s for whom the scripts pretentious mumbo-jumbo of undergraduate mythology religious mysticism and technobabble could even be a plus rather than a dramatic liability. Warner Bros. looks to collect a tidy sum in all markets from this shrewdly packaged head trip. Economically made in Australia for about 60 million live-action comic book marks a big step up in ambition for writer-directors Andy and Larry Wachowski whose first film was the lesbian crime meller ""Bound."" Reportedly the brothers penned ""The Matrix"" first and have been working on it steadily for five years; from the evidence they were grafting on surplus ideas during that time rather than subtracting and synthesizing. Not only is it a good half-hour too long but there are so many elements here -- Christian motifs and mysticism half-baked Eastern philosophy Lewis Carroll refs ambiguous oracular prophecies the co-existence of two realities pod-grown babies time travel creatures capable of rebirth and all importantly the expectation of the arrival of the Chosen One -- as to prove utterly indigestible. After a stunning big-city opening in which a young woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) outmaneuvers some pursuing agents via spectacular gravity-defying kung fu and gymnastics focus settles on a slacker-style software expert (Keanu Reeves) whos contacted by Trinity and eventually led to the mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) an alleged cult leader and terrorist who tells the recruit that he is The One the savior who reps the one hope in the face of malevolent technological forces aligned against humankind in 1999. But Morpheus inhabits a different universe one situated some 2000 years in the future and the articulate leader travels through this oceanic Other World with a lonely band of followers in a techno-heavy Nautilus-like sub. The young man agrees to be refitted to cybertronic specifications in a gruesomely spectacular sequence in which his natural body parts are replaced or reinforced by metal and synthetic material. He emerges from all the morphing with the name Neo as well as a plug in the back of his head through which he can instantly be uploaded with vast amounts of knowledge. Thus reconstituted Neo is ready to do battle with the forces that made the world what it has become. It seems that in the early 21st century there was an all-out war between human beings and advanced machines resulting in the triumph of artificial intelligence (perhaps this would have been the ideal playing field for the Wachowskis interests rather than the murkier one they chose). The underground city of Zion is now the last bastion of humankind which awaits The One to disrupt the Matrix a power field controlled by humanoid computers that have created a ""virtual"" real world fed by laboratory-controlled human energy. This new world order is enforced by men in black sunglasses led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). A full hour in the script is still entirely devoted to exposition -- Morpheus is brimming with apparent wisdom commanding aphorisms and tantalizing bits of information all designed to reveal a bit more about the situation at hand to Neo and the audience. Even at that point there remains the hope that some kind of focused story will finally get on track but it never really happens. Instead things settle into a muddle of showdowns resulting in deaths and resurrections that confoundingly answer few questions and follow no rules not even those specified by the film itself. All this is frustrating and ultimately wearying given that any number of the story strands could have been developed to profitable effect with sufficient rigor and concentration. As it is one gives up making any sense of it and settles for what the picture undeniably wields in spades which is a smorgasbord of effects that in some cases goes beyond what the sensation-seeking sci-fi audience has ever seen before. The morphing involved in numerous scenes is outstandingly fluid and vivid but its the way the martial arts are handled as promised in the opening teaser that sets ""The Matrix"" apart. Chinese kung fu and wire-stunt ace Yuen Wo Ping was engaged to choreograph the fight sequences which are on a level perhaps unsurpassed in an American film. Beyond that filmmakers have employed a technique they call ""bullet-time photography"" ultra-fast lensing that when combined with computer enhancement allows for altering the speed and trajectories of people and objects resulting in the live-action equivalent of a Japanese anime film. Characters can jump to enormous heights deliver startlingly quick kicks or pause in mid-flight shift directions land hard or softly or do anything else an animated figure might do. Except it looks amazingly real. The obviously obsessive attention that has been devoted to the visuals has paid off from top to bottom. The sinuous visual style the Wachowskis and cinematographer Bill Pope displayed to arresting effect in ""Bound"" is magnified many times here and the gleaming skyscrapers of the big city (Sydney) are dramatically contrasted in Owen Patersons production design with the murky threatening future of the bold crusaders. Visual effects supervisor John Gaeta black-and-leather-happy costume designer Kym Barrett the stunt team and the many other behind-the-scenes hands have been coordinated to put the films look splendidly over the top. Driving orchestral/synth original score by Don Davis is abetted by a selection of heavy rock by the likes of Marilyn Manson Ministry Prodigy Rage Against the Machine that will have the intended effect on the intended audience. Serious sincere and low-key Reeves gives his all here physically which in this instance counts for a lot. Beyond that he brings no more or less than he ever does to his role which translates into agreeable eye candy for some and boredom for others. Fishburne commandingly delivers his intellectual tidbits and pronouncements although to somewhat diminishing effect in the later going while the other thesps seem cast mostly for their physical profiles. Gloria Foster has a nice scene the warmest in the picture as the oracle who informs Neo whether hes The One.

Comments (3) The Matrix Rated R  136 minutes  1999 The Wachowskis turn their attention to metaphysical SF Keanu Reeves discovers that the universe (i.e. America and environs) is run by computers that use human beings as batteries for bioelectrical energy and that hes living not in 1999 but roughly two centuries later; Laurence Fishburne enlists Reeves to lead a revolt staffed by a small multinational crew (including kick-ass heroine Carrie-Anne Moss). This is simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources--Blade Runner (rainy and trash-laden streets) Men in Black (men in dark suits with shades) Star Wars for mythology Die Hard for skyscrapers Alien for secondary characters and decor Superman and True Lies for stunts and Videodrome for paranoia. Theres not much humor to keep it all life-size and by the final stretch its become bloated mechanical and tiresome.

"An Apocalypse of Kinetic Joy - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MatrixMovie Review An Apocalypse of Kinetic JoyImagination is overpowered by The Matrix a wild thriller in which reality may or may not be virtual. Exquisite visuals and rapid action tell a strong if bizarre story.March 31 1999|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC ""Imagine youre feeling a little like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole"" someone says in the dazzling and disorienting ""The Matrix"" and who has the strength to argue?A wildly cinematic futuristic thriller that is determined to overpower the imagination ""The Matrix"" combines traditional science-fiction premises with spanking new visual technology in a way that almost defies description. Like it or not this is one movie that words dont come close to approximating.Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers Larry and Andy ""The Matrix"" is the unlikely spiritual love child of dark futurist Philip K. Dick and the snap and dazzle of Hong Kong filmmaking with digital technology serving as the helpful midwife.Yet because this tale has been on the Wachowskis minds for so long--it was written before their 1996 debut film ""Bound""--""The Matrix"" never feels patched together. And its story constructed though it is from familiar elements and pseudo-mystical musings is nevertheless strong enough to support the films rip-roaring visuals.Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) a software programmer in a world very much like our own who goes by his nighttime hacker moniker of Neo has heard the Matrix whispered about his whole life but no one knows what it is. All the beautiful Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss of TVs ""Dark Justice"") can tell him is that ""its looking for you"" which is certainly scary but not a great deal of help.For that Neo has to turn to Trinitys partner the legendary Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) considered the most dangerous man alive by the authorities. What he says is more than frightening What Neo thinks is the real world is no more than a computer-generated dreamscape a virtual reality created by the artificial intelligence that really controls things to distract our human minds while our bodies are systematically plundered as an energy source to keep those nefarious machines up and running.Sometimes those machines take human form as agents robotic parodies of FBI men like the chilling Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving of ""Proof"" and ""The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert"") who wear security earpieces sunglasses and white shirts with ties and are terrifyingly close to indestructible.These Matrix men have a special interest in Neo. Theres a feeling in the air one that Morpheus and his ragtag colleagues (including ""Bound"" veteran Joe Pantoliano) are tempted to share that Neo might be the One the foretold liberator who has the power to destroy the Matrix and free the human race. But only the Oracle (a fine cameo by Gloria Foster) knows for sure and everything she says is well oracular.Obviously theres a great deal thats familiar about ""The Matrix"" starting with its sturdy themes of alternate realities the deadly rivalry between men and machines the resilient power of the human mind and the creeping dangers of conformity. And the films fake-Zen dialogue lines like ""Dont think you are; know you are"" and ""Theres a difference between knowing the path and walking the path"" isnt going to win any ovations for originality.On the other hand the somber quality of the dialogue suits the apocalyptic quality of ""The Matrix"" story and the gravity of the actors especially the always magisterial Fishburne and the magnetically phlegmatic Reeves makes the words more bemusing than bothersome.Helping most of all are the riveting visuals shot by Bill Pope. The Wachowskis do have a taste for the bizarre (witness an electronic bug that turns into a body-piercing insect) but this tendency pays off in bravura moments like a mesmerizing vista of a body farm without end (inspired by the work of comic-book artist Geof Darrow) where humans are relentlessly harvested for energy like so many replaceable Eveready batteries.Just as exciting are ""The Matrixs"" two kinds of action sequences. One strata involves John Woo-type expenditures of massive amounts of ammunition shot in super slow-motion and the other uses both Hong Kong-style stunt work and a technique the press notes refer to as ""bullet-time photography"" that involved shooting film at the computer-aided equivalent of 12000 frames per second.""The Matrix"" cast members who were involved in the films eye-catching kung fu fight sequences also apparently committed to four months of pre-production work with Hong Kong director and stunt coordinator Yuen Wo Ping someone who specializes in the technique known as wire fighting that gives H.K. films like ""Drunken Master"" ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and ""Fist of Legend"" their distinctive high-flying look.Not everything in ""The Matrix"" makes even minimal sense but the Wachowski brothers said to be major fans of comic books and graphic novels are sure-handed enough to smoothly pull us over the rough spots. When a film is as successful as this one is at hooking into the kinetic joy of adrenalized movie making quibbling with it feels beside the point. MPAA rating R for sci-fi violence and brief language. Times guidelines several grotesque moments involving voracious and aggressive oversized insect-like beings plus a graphic beating.The MatrixKeanu Reeves NeoLaurence Fishburne MorpheusCarrie-Anne Moss TrinityJoe Pantoliano CypherHugo Weaving Agent SmithWarner Bros. presents in association with Village Roadshow Pictures-Groucho II Film Partnership a Silver Pictures production.

"Matrix The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; matrix-the ) Matrix The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres no sophomore jinx for the Wachowski Brothers. Andy and Larry a pair of obviously talented film makers have returned to theaters with The Matrix a science fiction thriller that is every bit the match of their debut effort Bound for tension excitement and intelligence. In an era when movie scripts (especially those pigeonholed into the science fiction genre) are becoming increasingly more stupid and special effects reliant the Wachowskis prove that style and substance do not have to be mutually exclusive. I loved The Matrix and only a few minor contrivances associated with the climax caused the film to miss a four-star rating. The movie is kinetic atmospheric visually stunning and mind-bending. It toys with the boundaries between reality and fantasy in unique and interesting ways. In its approach and content it reminded me of last years vastly underrated Dark City. Theres also a synergy with two movies due to be released within the next month David Cronenbergs eXistenZ and Alejandro Amenabars Open Your Eyes. The Matrix is undeniably science fiction but unlike most pictures claiming that association it never falls into the boring expected patterns of space battles and laser gun shoot-outs. Instead it ventures into territory that while not virgin is sufficiently interesting to provide an involving invigorating backdrop. Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is leading a double life. To most people hes a hard-working computer programmer who holds down a nine-to-five job for a major software corporation. But in the privacy of his home hes a hacker named Neo who is ""guilty of virtually every computer crime [theres] a law for."" Neo is dissatisfied with his existence and while hes groping for a meaning to it he is contacted by a mysterious computer presence known as Morpheus. ""Wake up Neo"" a printout on his monitor screen reads. ""The Matrix has you. Follow the white rabbit."" And so begins an amazing odyssey for both Neo and the audience. It turns out that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is the captain of a small space ship and he believes that Neo is a messianic figure. When the two finally meet Morpheus explains to Neo that all is not as it seems. The reality he is used to is a fabrication the product of a sinister race of intelligent machines that use human beings as power supplies to be discarded at will. Neo is dubious and Morpheus sets out to show him the truth. Soon he is learning how to manipulate the Matrix a computer-generated dreamworld built by the machines to control human minds. But danger lurks ahead for Morpheus and his small band of followers. The goal of the machines is to eliminate all free humans and their most powerful weapons the Sentient Agents (who look like Men in Black) are closing in. Led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) their goal is to capture Morpheus and pry the secrets from his brain. Theres much more to The Matrix than this but to explain further would be to reveal plot twists better discovered through viewing. Although the film frequently toys with the blurred line between grim reality and computer-generated fantasy it rarely leaves the viewer completely confused (except perhaps at the very beginning). The Wachowskis have carefully structured the story in such a way that the audience is capable of following the action and understanding whats going on even when all of the secrets have not been revealed. Nevertheless because The Matrix is intelligent it will defeat those unwilling to invest some intellectual participation. The payoff is worth the effort. Stylistically The Matrix is much like Bound. Both films are visually stunning with images painstakingly constructed and action sequences choreographed to excite the eye and quicken the pulse. The Wachowskis use a varied pallette that includes shadows slow motion quick cuts and offbeat humor to paint a unique portrait. Like in Dark City theirs is a grim world where darkness and gloom seemingly always hold sway. Everything from the set design to the costumes (lots of black lots of sunglasses) is intended to contribute to an overall look. When it comes to shoot-outs the Wachowskis show that John Woo isnt the only director capable of doing interesting things with familiar devices. The shots of Keanu Reeves streaking down a hall with guns blazing all around him and the air thick with shattered bits of concrete is only one of many snapshots that lingers in the minds eye long after they have vanished from the screen. The special effects which are not as numerous as those in many science fiction pieces are flawless. Keanu Reeves is not generally regarded as a strong actor but given the right part - one that doesnt demand much subtlety or emoting - he can be effective. His role as Neo fits the criteria. The Matrix needs a leading man who can look good act cool and not stumble over his dialogue and Reeves is three for three. Its easily his best work since Speed where the same kinds of demands were made of him. For more nuanced performances the Wachowskis rely on the rest of the cast the always excellent Laurence Fishburne brilliant character actor Joe Pantoliano (who appeared in Bound) and Carrie-Anne Moss who looks great in black leather. Aussie Hugo Weaving (Proof) brings the perfect mix of dry wit and menace to his role as the head Man in Black. The Matrix offers a little something for everyone. The die-hard science fiction fan will discover a plot that mixes and matches both new and old conventions of the genre in a compelling fashion. Action aficionados will find that theres no shortage of electric excitement whether its in the form of hand-to-hand kung fu-type fights or shoot-outs with seemingly limitless ammunition. Theres also betrayal a little romance some humor and a moral dilemma or two all wrapped into a well-produced package. As I stated earlier the way in which the Wachowskis choose to resolve everything seems slightly contrived but in the overall scheme of things thats a small price to pay for one of the most enjoyable science fiction thrillers to reach the screen in months.

A more technically dazzling synthesis of action choreography and cutting-edge computer graphics has not been seen since James Camerons ""T2."" ""The Matrix"" will do enormous business among genre fans alone. But that script - oy You expect screenplays for movies like this to be striplings on which to hang flashy action and visuals. ""Matrix"" suffers from the opposite problem. The Wachowski brothers twentysomething writer-directors whose last feature was the Sappho-vs.-the-Mob drama ""Bound"" have jammed so many interesting but half-baked ideas into their overlong (two hours-plus) picture that none of them gets a satisfactory workout and in fact they gum up the storytelling. Its difficult to discuss ""The Matrix"" in detail without revealing too many of its mysteries. Its narrative pleasures come from the striptease revelations about the true nature of the Matrix of the title. It has to do with the nature of reality but like the press notes say ""No one can be told what The Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" But I can in good faith tell you this much The hero is Neo a mild-mannered hacker geek played by the android-like Keanu Reeves. He is inadvertently drawn into a dark underworld when a strange voice in a phone call warns him that he is being pursued by baddies. After a ""Men in Black""-type squad captures him and performs an exotic interrogation Neo falls in with a shadowy group of cyber-rebels and is spirited away to their hideout. Their leader is Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who gives Neo the choice to learn the truth about the world he inhabits and be initiated into their cell or to remain blissfully ignorant. Of course Neo chooses truth else thered be no movie. He undergoes a brain-frying (his and ours) ""rebirth"" - ""tumbling down the rabbit hole"" its called - thats brilliantly phantasmagorical. Neo then begins a Luke Skywalker-like apprenticeship under Morpheus learning the rules of the game and how to use his cool new powers to fight the ""MiB"" tyranny ruling the planet. The Wachowskis dont always follow the rules they establish for themselves (bullets for example hurt people - except when they dont). And the performances leave something to be desired. Overwrought direction turns chief Man in Black Hugo Weaving into a bus-and-truck Tommy Lee Jones. It is however very easy to overlook this movies faults when confronted by the razzle-dazzle visual effects the Wachowskis pioneer here. The actors dodge bullets leap over chasms engage in terrifically choreographed (by Yuen Wo Ping) martial-arts sequences - all of which are presented with breakneck speed visual seamlessness and breathless realism from unusual points of view. Its like animation come to three-dimensional life and f/x addicts as well as sci-fi fans will not want to miss a split-second.

""Neo"" can be read as an anagram for ""one"" which is no coincidence Hes a computer hacker who gets caught up with a band of digital rebels led by the mysterious Morpheus (a way-cool and cryptic Laurence Fishburne). Their mission is to expose and destroy the Matrix - an artificial reality that is everywhere and that has turned humankind into a race of automatonlike ninnies.Morpheus believes Neo may be the Chosen One a person whose cyber prowess and psychic strength are formidable enough to destroy the seemingly invincible Matrix and its stone-faced agents - guys who dress like the Blues Brothers and who can dodge bullets climb walls and literally wipe the grins from peoples faces. (In one torture scene they seal Neos mouth shut just by willing it.)If The Matrix filmed by Bill Pope with dizzying verve is hard to follow at times thats sort of the point Neo who teams up with the beauteous kick-boxing freedom fighter Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) gets himself downloaded into so many virtual-reality scenarios (or are they?) that hes not sure whether hes coming or going.But whatever direction hes heading in Neo gets to do some heavy-duty kung fu in the process. Connoisseurs of Hong Kong martial-arts pics the Wachowskis recruited legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping to suspend their actors on wires and send them flying across rooftops. Hurtling spinning swooping whooshing along walls and charging across ceilings Neo and company become an agile army of fire-powered Fred Astaires. We have blood and bullets galore here but also some mind-blowing ballet. The Matrix offers the most exhilaratingly inventive action sequences to come down the pike in years.The brothers Wachowski - whose previous feature the engagingly quirky 1996 thriller Bound was a study in insular intimate noir - clearly have an affinity for pop and pulp culture. The Matrix with its mix of Lewis Carroll and William Gibson; Japanese anime and Chinese chopsocky; mythological allusions and machine-made illusion offers a couple of hours of escapist fun.As Keanu says Whoa Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementCruz pledges to unify GOP AmericansMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Thank God it never got it. It rocks. Emerging from the sick minds of the Wachowski brothers - these bad boys named Larry and Andy who made their mark with the perverse yet witty lesbo-noir ""Bound"" - it postulates the following You (and me and everyone else) are not the lean sleek creatures our mirrors display each morning. We are the dreams in the soft brain of a cloned baby whose pulpy body is suspended in fluid in a tube tended by intelligent machines. We are fed a diet of electronic impulses that stimulate us into thinking we live in a place called ""here"" on a planet called Earth in a year called 1999. In other words all reality that we experience is virtual reality. Why do the machines keep us alive? I missed that part. I guess they need our energy to run their garbage disposals or possibly they require help with their taxes. But humanity dozes onward - its really 2099 - in caverns that look like they were designed by Attila the Huns version of Albert Speer all deco-Gothic-art-moderne-cathedral-esque vault of darkness.

Again my ancient brain is too sludgy with concepts like ""logic"" and ""cause-effect"" and ""probability"" to follow the mechanics of it It seems that the commando team led by a genius called Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) seeks to overthrow the machine order. They live underground they come up in some sort of ship (again me no get) and in that proximity to the caverns they can plug into the Matrix and thereby insert themselves into our reality where they seek to awaken us but are thwarted by ""agents"" (of the machines) that look like Men in Black but are really Sentient Programs. Meanwhile the agents themselves are searching for Zi-on (as its pronounced) the last real city on Earth or really under it. The higher eschatology of this is weirdly resonant and titillating; its like that moment in an 8-year-olds life when he realizes that atoms and the solar system are the same configuration and goes on to wonder if the solar system isnt an atom in a giants universe (I still do. That would be neat-o huh?) What follows is an action movie with mythic overtones in a vernacular of virtuoso tricks and unseen but weirdly familiar vision. It seems like a battle royal in dreamland where the logic has a nightmare quality to it a freedom from responsibility and sense thats somehow bracing. Put another way heres what follows from this setup everything. You name it they stuff it in a whole vastness of pulp tropes. Commando raids guns kung fu lovey-dovey stuff betrayal monsters punk fashion neon torture explosions even a few dangerous ideas. Fortunately the actors are dull enough so that they dont get in the way of the directors. Our hero is Neo (i.e. ""new man"") played by the nice-to-look-at/impossible-to-take-seriously Keanu Reeves. Hes okay not that youd notice if he wasnt. The others - Joe Pantoliano Carrie-Anne Moss Hugo Weaving to name most - are also okay though maybe they werent and I didnt notice. What you do notice is the incredible energy and stylizations of the Wachowskis who seem to represent the next generation with a vengeance. I have seen the future and it smirks. Is this what the movies are becoming? Well yes. But at least the Bros. W. do it with the brilliance and zip of the pioneer spirit. Their minds stretched and liberated by the possibilities of cyberspace John Woo CD-ROMs and microwave ovens that can heat a hot dog in 25 seconds they seem to imagine movie plots in five dimensions not a mere three and action in six. ""The Matrix"" builds to such kinetic momentum that the movie becomes a spike of pure action and since its taking place in baby brain reality rather than authentic reality its liberated from gravity and sense. The story is told from Neos point of view and it tracks his burgeoning consciousness and his sense of what he can do. Turns out hes ""new"" in more than one sense. In fact he might be ""The One"" whos come to lead the tribe to redemption. (Question How can these people ""save"" humanity? Humanity is a toothpaste of DNA and protein in tubes. Are these five people going to break all the tubes and raise a billion babies? Answer Not given.) So someone has read the Bible and someone has seen ""Star Wars"" and someone knows who both Odysseus and Gilgamesh are. Is it a movie or a pop quiz on classical mythology? Theres a kind of liberating almost transforming energy in this film; it lights you up and sends you out all giddy with silliness. You wont quite know what youve seen but dammit you know youve seen something.

"Denver Entertainment The Denver Post Denver Entertainment What is ""Matrix""? Too long too corny What The Matrix Directed and written by The Wachowski Brothers Photography by Bill Pope Starring Keanu Reeves Laurence Fishburne Carrie-Anne Moss Hugo Weaving Joe Pantoliano Running time 2 hours 15 minutes Rating R for violence adult subject matter one drug reference scary science-fiction-style sequences and overall dark mood Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures Opens Today at area theaters By Steven Rosen Denver Post Movie Critic March 31 - Keanu Reeves turned down ""Speed 2 for this? ""The Matrix not only is a failure as a science-fiction movie - long on explanation short on inspiration - but it doesnt do anything interesting with the futuristic vision that it takes forever to explain. Instead it reverts to a John Woo-style arty karateand-guns action flick that reveals how clueless writerdirectors Larry and Andy Wachowski ( ""Bound) are about finding an effective resolution of their films plot. Theyre trying to fake their way past the lack of story with mindless mayhem. Thank goodness then they at least have some unusual special effects and visual tricks. Some of these are arresting especially when the characters are in two places at once. But like so many movies with great effects but no emotional connection ""Matrix leaves us feeling like were not anywhere at all. Ultimately its dead time. And then there is Reeves who plays Neo - a computer hacker chosen by a small band of human renegades to lead the fight against a totalitarian society ruled by computers. What an ironic choice to play a human at war against artificial intelligence Reeves has become so slow and inexpressively impenetrable an actor that hes a veritable zombie. Exaggerated poses In fact when the film calls for him to lively up for combat with some exaggerated Bruce Lee-like karate poses and movements you have to laugh at his fast movements. They seem so unexpected. He plays Neo like a Geo. Since this 2-hour movie is still explaining its premise - and the meaning of the matrix - well into its second hour I hesitate to try to summarize it here. Needless to say it should be shorter. In the future after a war that humans have lost to artificial intelligence (no it didnt start in the Balkans) computers use humans as an energy source. The invisible omnipresent Matrix controls us by programming a pleasantly complacent alternative reality into our brains. That way we cant see that the world is in ruins - darkness and gloom rule. Vague suspicion But Reeves character has a vague feeling that hes living a false life. He lives in a cramped drab apartment where he is reading a book on nihilism. And hes using his home computer to search for a higher meaning. One day an unexpected e-mail arrives ""The Matrix has you. Follow the Red Rabbit. A small group of anti-Matrix renegades led by the godlike Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) has decided Neo is their savior to destroy the system. But first Morpheus must toughen Neo physically and mentally for the freedom fight ahead. Among his small band of rebels is the severely muscular but attractive Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is quietly in love with Neo. Much of our understanding of what is happening is provided by Morpheus. Fishburne who takes his role too seriously intones his dialogue in the kind of soft comforting speech favored by late-night lite-jazz deejays. And frequently it is as insipid as lite-jazz ""There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path is an example. Wearing a black full-length coat and dark sunglasses Fishburne looks cool. But then everyone is wearing black in this film much of which takes place in a squalid and equally dark urban environment. Familiar concept Thats a tipoff that its production design is more pretentious than portentous and that the film is more a half-thought-through reworking of ideas explored in ""Blade Runner ""Terminator ""Dark City ""Darkman and especially ""Pi than anything original. One aspect of it already seems to have been parodied in ""Men in Black - Secret Service-like police wearing black suits and shades murderously chase after Morpheus gang. As lead Agent Smith Australian actor Hugo Weaving gives what appears to be an intentionally comic performance speaking so slowly and deliberately you can almost go to the bathroom and get back between sentences. Thankfully there are enough neat effects to jolt you up whenever you start to nod off. The Wachowskis use slow-motion and stop-action for fight sequences and sometimes twist around camera angles so that perspective keeps changing like an M.C. Escher print. And when Morpheus crew members use their minds to transport themselves into on-earth adventures while resting in trance aboard a hovercraft the complicated concept is well-realized through cross-cutting and editing. There are some other thrills. Agent Smith and his men implant a listening bug into Neos navel that really is a bug. And then Morpheus squad pulls it right back out - yech And Neo has one bummer of a badhallucination trip wrestling bugs and becoming immersed in gooey liquid and nightmarish fears. Theres also a quick but arresting image of some monster bull-shaped machines sowing artificially bred humans in fields like so much corn. Unfortunately too much of this movie is itself so much corn.

C+ The Matrix Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Action/Adventure; Starring Laurence Fishburne Carrie-Anne Moss Keanu Reeves Marcus Chong Joe Pantoliano Hugo Weaving; Director Andy Wachowski Lana Wachowski; Author Andy Wachowski Lana Wachowski; Producer (person) Joel Silver; Runtime (in minutes) 136; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 9 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT Keanu Reeves has logged more than 35 pictures on his resume yet I still cant get him in focus as an actor. Im not talking about his fine form which I can clearly see and appreciate -- the exotic eyes the dancers limbs the characteristic expression of serene blankness hinting at either deep secrets or maybe only serene blankness. But the essence of Keanu his own private I-dunno -- ah that is the mystery on which millions meditate Is there a there there? Rivers Edge Bill amp; Teds Excellent Adventure My Own Private Idaho Speed and The Devils Advocate lead us to believe there is; Much Ado About Nothing Johnny Mnemonic and A Walk in the Clouds all point to No. Little Buddha asks Huh? The Matrix suggests that a computer has taken the measure of the man -- now 34 and maturing into even greater timeworn beauty -- and has calculated that the most efficient use of the guy with the least wear and tear on his dramatic abilities is as a piece of handsome machinery a morph of Speeds action hero and Johnny Mnemonics brain-scan man. In this flashy sci-fi thriller underwritten and overdirected by Andy and Larry Wachowski the brothers who made the scenically kinky lesbo-noir caper Bound Reeves plays a hacker called Neo who lives in a grim future disguised as the present. Its a future in which daily life is actually an elaborate construct controlled by artificially intelligent computers i.e. the Matrix. In classic sci-fi form the rabble dont realize that theyre blips in a global virtual-reality game. Following similar genre convention evil Matrix-made agents wear the dark sunglasses and suits of Secret Service men and purse their lips in ritualized expressions of humorlessness. But a group of freedom fighters want to bust loose like rebels in a commercial for Macintosh computers. These individualists in sexy black-leather couture (one played by former model Carrie-Anne Moss ideal for marketing as a somber Matrix Barbie doll) report to a cryptic Obi-Wanish guru Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). And Morpheus -- a paranoid but benevolent leader -- has identified Neo as The One. The One what? Handsome cyber-Buddha I guess who if he accepts his fate (and acquires the right wardrobe and training) can free humanity from the tyranny of the soulless Matrix. In fact the real soullessness here is built into the production a polished adaptation of Hong Kong-style filmmaking that with its cast of depressive characters allows for little Hong Kong-style joy. With stunt work supervised by veteran choreographer Yuen Wo Ping (whose father worked with Jackie Chan) and groundbreaking special effects The Matrix sells itself as a gaudy chopsocky concoction with expensive Hollywood action details -- a blast of Holly-Kong glitz that never approaches the stylistic cohesiveness of say John Woos Face/Off or the charisma of that films propulsive star John Travolta. With the aid of invisible wires and nifty camera work the cast shimmies up walls and flips through the air as bullets fly. Bodies absorb all sorts of assaults and mutilation then reassemble themselves whole. But Fred Astaire got there first dancing on the ceiling nearly half a century ago in Royal Wedding. Terminator 2 reconstituted evil in human form over and over again. The same cinematic advances that destroyed the White House in Independence Day diminish the impact of elegant stunt work in a story with nothing more to care about. Reeves and Fishburne can flip and scramble all they want. But to an audience inured to spectacle flipping and scrambling demonstrations dont raise the pulse in this convoluted yet rudimentary yarn. The moral of The Matrix I think is that people who spend too much time staring at the computer screen and not enough time enjoying healthy physical activity like kung fu are susceptible to brainwash. Of course if we rabble understood more about what moves Keanu Reeves to express emotion -- any emotion -- we wouldnt be wasting so much time jacked into the Internet poring over Reeves websites looking for clues to his Buddha-like passivity.

"The Matrix (R) Related Item ""The Matrix"" showtimes A Derivative Dazzling Matrix By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 2 1999 Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss star in ""The Matrix."" (Warner Bros.) Director Andy Wachowski; Larry Wachowski Cast Keanu Reeves; Laurence Fishburne; Carrie-Anne Moss; Joe Pantoliano Running Time 2 hours 15 minutes Contains martial arts many spent shell casings and the standard sci-fi goo and gore If you believe the Warner Bros. PR mystique about ""The Matrix"" filmmakers Larry and Andy Wachowski little is known about this pair of writing and directing brothers other than they are in their early thirties and they made 1996s lesbian-noir ""Bound."" Im only guessing from what I see on the screen but Ill tell you this much about them They spent too much time going to the movies as kids they know a rip-roaring yarn when they see one and they are not afraid to steal - excuse me appropriate - the ideas of their betters if it suits their purpose. But what a grand and glorious purpose it is evoking ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""Men in Black"" ""Blade Runner"" the Holy Bible Greek mythology TVs old ""Kung Fu"" series James Bond ""The Terminator"" ""High Noon"" ""Alien"" and ""Star Wars."" Let me see am I leaving anything out? Oh yes there is also an element of ""Sleeping Beauty"" thrown in with a kick-boxing princess (k.d. lang look-alike Carrie-Anne Moss) instead of the prince and a sleeping beauty who looks like . . . Keanu Reeves. There is no Shakespeare Queen Elizabeth or World War II in this movie thank God. ""The Matrix"" is just one big fat honking comic book of a sci-fi-martial-arts adventure flick. It goes over the top comes back around the bottom and then back over the top again. It has stu-freakin-pendous special effects hipster sang-froid out the wazoo and a story line that makes only as much sense as it has to. Fortunately for fuddy-duddies like me it does make some. The year is somewhere around 2099 although it looks like the present. Thats because ""the present"" is basically a virtual-reality illusion (the Matrix of the title) downloaded over wires plugged directly into our bodies by evil overlords who harvest human beings like ears of corn off bioelectronic stalks and then raise us as slaves or batteries (or something). You just think youre reading this film review dated April 2 1999 because youre hard-wired to a 21st-century computer that tells you you are. Still with me? Somehow through the use of a magic red pill (dont laugh thats the ""Wonderland"" reference) and some very cool-looking hardware a charismatic rebel named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) has managed to liberate a ragtag band of guerrillas who fly around town in a hovercraft toggling back and forth between the real world of the future and the fake Matrix of the present as they battle someone named Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his Blues Brothers-suited henchmen who I think are really nasty computer applications. Morpheuss latest recruit is a software company flunky named Thomas Anderson who goes by the hacker handle Neo (Reeves) and who may just be The One (a sort of cyber-Messiah who will lead our heros to Zion and the land of the unplugged). Okay thats enough of that. Reeves and Fishburne make a convincing team of master and student badasses and Moss more than holds her own for the Riot Grrrl contingent. As the shape-shifting Smith Weaving calls to mind the sullen cool of ""Terminator 2 Judgment Days"" Robert Patrick as the liquid-metal villain T-1000. Kudos to production designer Owen Paterson and comic-book artist Geof Darrow for their angular techno-grunge world of black leather sunglasses after dark and tentacled machines. Mucho kudos to Hong Kong fight coordinator Yuen Wo Ping for his wire-stunt expertise that makes the actors fly through the air like a bunch of angry buff marionettes. And special kudos to the mysterious Wachowski tag team who have created a lurid splashy nightmare for the end of the millennium. As we grit our teeth in preparation for the Y2K computer problem the most interesting thing about ""The Matrix"" is the fact that the Wachowskis see technology for exactly what it is - both our curse and our salvation.

"Altmans Gold Slate Sign In Sign Up Altmans Gold Altmans Gold Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 11 1999 330 AM Altmans Gold And Drew Barrymores. And the Wachowski Brothers. By David Edelstein Cookies FortuneDirected by Robert Altman October FilmsNever Been Kissed Directed by Raja Gosnell 20th Century FoxThe Matrix Directed by the Wachowski Brothers Warner Bros. I dont want to project too much onto Robert Altmans bluesy charmer Cookies Fortune--to argue for instance that its the work of an old master summing up. But it sure feels that way. The screenwriter Anne Rapp has provided Altman with a blueprint not only for an ensemble comedy but also for a comedy that honors the very idea of an ensemble. Its no wonder Altman fell on it. As early as MASH (1970) the director seemed more taken with the ebb and flow of groups than with the isolated treks of individuals. Its not just that he likes to tell stories with multiple strands or that he gets bored easily with one consciousness or even that he cherishes some 60s utopian fantasy of the collective. What Cookies Fortune suggests is that for Altman order in the universe cant be discerned in the comings and goings of lone heroes but in the interactions among vast and disparate collections of people. This time out he transforms the bad vibes of his other films into a vision thats positively serene. He celebrates a universe that has found its equilibrium and the easy way in which it rights itself when a nasty bit of flotsam threatens to throw it out of whack. Advertisement The movie takes place in the Deep South which was also the setting for Altmans edgy disharmonic thriller The Gingerbread Man (1998). The opening is teasingly misleading as if to make you think youre seeing The Gingerbread Man II In Holly Springs a small Mississippi cotton town Willis Richland (Charles S. Dutton) staggers out of a blues joint semi-drunk then drops his bottle of bourbon when a police car glides ominously past. So he heads back into the bar steals a fifth of Wild Turkey then ambles past the railroad tracks and peeps into a van where a young woman (Liv Tyler) has been undressing. Then he climbs in the window of a big antebellum house and takes some guns from a glass cabinet at the foot of the main staircase. So far so Southern Gothic. Except that Willis it turns out is the towns gentlest spirit loved even by those passing police who are his fishing buddies. Hes a caretaker at that house--he couldnt find his keys. The girl he was spying on is the runaway niece of the elderly widow ""Cookie"" Orcutt (Patricia Neal) he works for. Hed promised to clean those guns before he went to bed. And the next afternoon Willis buys a fifth of Wild Turkey and surreptitiously slips it behind the bar of the blues joint to replace the one hed swiped. The owner (Rufus Thomas) pretends not to notice but when Willis leaves he turns to his chesty singer (Ruby Wilson) and says ""Willis is even again."" Thats the core of Cookies Fortune ""Willis is even again."" It suggests a community in which everything is in balance in which people accept the good and the bad in faith that it will all even out in the end. The picture sits vaguely in the comic-mystery genre but its more of a relaxant than a thriller. Theres a violent death and a cover-up and the police have to figure out what really happened before an innocent person is condemned to prison--or worse. But Altman doesnt let the audiences outrage mount. The act that kicks the movie into a higher gear comes nearly half an hour in and Altman is in no hurry to get to his narrative point. Thats probably because he has to eliminate Cookie to do it and Patricia Neal isnt someone you want to get rid of. The actress now in her 70s has shrunk in physical stature but has otherwise swelled--I dont remember her having such power in her lungs. When she sucks on her pipe and stares at the gun cabinet and upbraids her late husband for leaving her behind Altman clearly wants her to take all the time in the world. How do you convince young directors to watch and emulate Altman? Its so much easier to push a filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick whose brilliant sequences you can screen and dissect in a cinema studies class. Altman uses a distinctive color palette here--a lot of neonlike primary colors as if the whole Mississippi town were a blues joint--but his mastery is in his offhandedness in how he conceals his own storytelling. Theres always a sense that his characters are living even when youre not watching them maybe because the actors dont seem ""on"" the way they do for other directors Altman catches them in his gaze and gives them the once-over and then they go about their business. Actors I didnt think Id want to see again--Ned Beatty and Donald Moffat--I wanted to see more of and Chris ODonnell is positively reborn as a bumbling young policeman who only wants to make out with Liv Tyler against the station house soda machine. Courtney B. Vance shows up as an officious homicide detective from a nearby city who finds Holly Springs lazy informality irritating but none of the women wants to answer his queries They want to flirt with him and he cant help falling into their easy rhythms. Advertisement Glenn Close plays Camille Orcutt Cookies histrionic niece and the director of the church theatricals (currently Oscar Wildes Salome) whose hysterical obsession with hiding the ""disgraceful"" truth throws the town into an uproar. I was surprised to find Close in the movie since her clenched overly controlled acting seems at odds with what Altman usually goes for. But this might be her best performance ever. Her Camille is like a steely demented temperance activist who keeps charging into otherwise relaxed settings and throwing them into chaos. (""Youd think the police could take their stupid crime tape with them when they leave"") She pairs beautifully with Julianne Moore as Camilles simple-minded vaguely schitzy sister Cora whos so browbeaten that whenever shes called on to talk the Scripture comes flowing out of her mouth like lava. The truth in Cookies Fortune isnt ferreted out a la Murder She Wrote; it emerges in dribs and drabs--a witness here a piece of evidence there--as if by natural law. You might even say that the truth emerges as a consequence of chaos and not from some misguided pursuit of order. What seems on the surface as ingratiating a movie as Altman has ever made is actually packed with subversive ideas. It ends on a note of blithe miscegenation--just the sort of punch line to send the Camilles of the world screaming from the theater swiping at invisible bugs. A s a young movie critic I made the wrong sort of name for myself by swooning in print over many a nubile actress. Yes I was often promiscuous in my praise and yes my affaires de la tete were often sadly short-lived. But Ive practiced the critical equivalent of abstinence for many years now and its time to reassert what can never be forgotten It is the right nay the duty of a critic to fall and fall hard. I see no point in writing about Never Been Kissed--a pleasant but annoyingly insubstantial teen comedy--unless I can pull out the stops and say its worth seeing it demands to be seen for Drew Barrymore who is at once the dizziest and most magically poised comedienne in movies today. Barrymore plays a frumpy newspaper copy editor whos ordered to go undercover as a high-school student by a nuttily competitive publisher (Garry Marshall). Is Drew a convincing frump? Surprisingly so. She hits her slight speech impediment harder than usual and further relaxes her already shlumpy posture. Trying to fit in with the ""cool"" kids she seems heartbreakingly defenseless. You could mistake her for an ordinary unaffected nerd except that the genius Barrymore timing is in every breath every screwy inflection every pratfall. After an hour I thought that Never Been Kissed might be the most fun teenpic since Clueless but ultimately the movie takes too many shortcuts even on its own dumb formulaic terms and it cant make up its mind whether it wants to pander to teen-age fantasies of good looks and popularity or to scold teen-agers for being so shallow. No matter. The picture would have to be a hell of a lot worse to keep me from going back to watch Drew bite her lower lip and that shy smile spread meltingly across that sweet eternally girlish face and ... W ait maybe Id better switch to The Matrix which made 37 million in its first week and seems poised to become a phenomenon. Directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski its a mishmash of Hong Kong sword-fighting ghost epics Kafkaesque virtual reality fantasies Cronenbergian visions of cybernetically enhanced flesh Alice in Wonderland surrealism post-apocalyptic urban grunge Terminator-like battles of man vs. machine and portentous lumpen-Zen posturing (""I can only show you the door. You have to walk through it""). It shouldnt make a lick of sense let alone feel all of a piece but The Matrix is actually one of the more lyrical sci-fi action thrillers ever made in which space and time become love slaves to the directors witty visual fancies. Keanu Reeves makes a lean strikingly beautiful tabula rasa hero twisting out of the way of bullets that elongate like silver beads of mercury and hes partnered by the equally hard blank and androgynously gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss. Walls and pillars explode around them but the sleek geometric lines of their bodies never soften. The machines in comparison seem fuzzy.

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Part of me wants to dismiss ""The Matrix"" as a loud and empty spectacle 1999s apex of dazzling technological style over substance. It lacks anything like adult emotion and its themes and images arrive at a dizzying stupefying pace as if vomited up by some voracious creature that ate the last 20 years of sci-fi and action-movie history and only partly digested them.In fact the Wunderkind writing/directing team of Andy and Larry Wachowski (whose previous film was the gangster pastiche ""Bound"") have performed a sort of public service for infrequent moviegoers. If youve never seen a John Woo film any of the ""Alien"" movies ""Blade Runner"" or either of the Terminators or if you believe the Borg was a medieval castle and ""City of Lost Children"" was one of the more obscure Italian neorealist films then you can do all your pop-culture homework in one fell swoop. ""The Matrix"" is all of those films as well as a video game a primer on Zen Buddhism and a parable of the Second Coming. It may bore you to death or blow your mind -- and its long and convoluted enough to do both -- but it holds nothing back.Eventually the sheer density of plot and action in ""The Matrix"" convinced me that the Wachowskis are serious about their craft if about nothing else. If most sci-fi films skimp on story to get to the explosions and chase sequences more quickly this present-meets-future-meets-apocalypse yarn offers such an intricate plot you cant keep it all in your head at the same time. I kind of understand why bullets and helicopter crashes are deadly even in a world that turns out to be an elaborate illusion. But I cant figure out why the evil government agents who abduct a clean-cut young software engineer named Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) and melt his face early in the film also implant a creepy crawly cyborg-scorpion in his tummy. Maybe just because they can. They hardly need to keep track of his movements since theyre pretty much the omniscient masters of the universe. Or something.Thats the way it is with ""The Matrix"" -- you either give away major plot points or you cant really talk about it at all. Anderson works in an office in regular old 1999 though its an oddly timeless clammy version of the present via ""Seven"" and ""Blade Runner"" full of dripping Gothic architecture monochrome clothing and outdated cars. When he isnt at work he becomes Neo a hacker searching cyberspace for traces of a shadowy character called Morpheus who in turn is somehow involved with a mysterious construct or theory or whangdoodle called the Matrix. (Its amazing that movies can still make people who sit on their asses in front of a computer seem like theyre doing something cool and dangerous.)Morpheus turns out to be Laurence Fishburne in little round sunglasses playing precisely the urbane black hipster every bored white suburban kid dreams of meeting -- the guy wholl turn you on to some opiated hashish blast you with the tenor solo from ""Chasin the Trane"" and lay a heavy Zen koan on you all in the same afternoon. We may be a long way from racial justice in America but in Hollywood movies blackness is the universally understood symbol for superior wisdom.His band of trendily clad renegades includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) a boyish vixen in Irma Vep leathers and Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) whose shaved pate and devilish goatee make him resemble an aging techno DJ trying to hang on to street cred. The group dashes through the nameless city from one fashionably decaying set to another one step ahead of the face-melting agents themselves sporting the retro shades and tie clips of LBJs Secret Service. Both sides in this conflict are able to dodge bullets run up walls and across ceilings and otherwise suspend the ordinary rules of space and time. But theyre not so super-powerful apparently as to make the near-constant gunplay and martial-arts combat unnecessary. You Might Also Like With the gnostic manner of Alices Caterpillar -- Lewis Carroll is another point of reference that gets tiresomely hammered home here -- Morpheus offers Neo two pills. One will return him to his drone existence while the other will open his mind to the Matrix so he can learn what the hell is going on. It doesnt take a degree in Miltonic studies to understand that any red-blooded action hero will choose the hit of acid over the tranquilizer. If theres one thing we know about Keanu Reeves characters here -- and there might be only one thing -- its that theyre earnest searchers after the truth. Its here that this previously frenzied movie goes completely apeshit. Weve got gravity-free virtual-reality kung fu choreographed by Hong Kong wizard Woo-ping Yuen. Weve got millions of mechanical spiders along with killing machines that look like a crossbreed between Whoopi Goldberg and a giant squid. Weve got the entire human race enslaved in individual tubs of goo or maybe inside a giant computer program or both.So what is the Matrix exactly? Let Morpheus explain ""The Matrix is everything it is all around us. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to shield you from the truth."" Um OK. Is Neo really the long-prophesied savior of humanity? (Maybe.) Is a cookie-baking Marlboro-smoking middle-aged black lady really an all-seeing oracle? (Sure.) Perhaps the unutterably evil Agent Smith (a good role for the sardonic acting style of Hugo Weaving) is closer to the mark when he says ""Human beings are a cancer on this planet. We are the cure."" Needless to say all this pseudo-spiritual hokum along with the overamped onslaught of special effects -- some of them quite amazing -- will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside. Theres no point defending ""The Matrix"" on intellectual grounds -- its too big too noisy and not nearly as original as all the movies it so successfully absorbs and emulates. If youre the kind of person who feels tired after five minutes of MTV dont even consider it. Once considered a sensitive actor Reeves now gets by on his athletic bearing and stoic demeanor; Neo seems nearly as robotic as the computer-generated agents pursuing him. But as in ""Bound"" theres an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis work and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction but their passion for movies -- for making them watching them inhabiting their world -- is pure and deep.

Starring Keanu Reeves. Written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski. (R. 135 minutes.) Brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski the hotshot writing-and- directing team clearly set out to astonish with ""The Matrix"" the Keanu Reeves cyberspace opera and they certainly do. Its astonishing that so much money talent technical expertise and visual imagination can be put in the service of something so stupid. If anybody ever wanted to see Reeves shaved naked and covered with slime now is the chance. He plays a computer hacker who stumbles into a vague awareness that this world is but the dim reflection of a controlling cyberworld ""out there."" As he moves between this world and that he materializes at one point as a kung fu artist. Later he flies through the air like a refugee from some Hong Kong fantasy. Its more empty technical razzmatazz. We know he is puzzled about which reality he currently occupies because he squinches up his eyebrows. Laurence Fishburne as a mysterious cyberworld overlord has the chore of making absolute nonsense sound as if he believes it. He does this by e-nun-ci-a-ting every syllable. As one of his underlings Joe Pantoliano is the only cast member who shows a spark of wit but even he is eventually swamped by the hopeless muddle that ""The Matrix"" becomes.
