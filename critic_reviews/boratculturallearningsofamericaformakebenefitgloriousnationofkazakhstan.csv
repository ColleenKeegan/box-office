""Borat"" wasnt just the funniest movie of the year but the most controversial fudging the divide between comedy documentary and faux-documentary. ""United 93"" and ""World Trade Center"" came face to face with 9/11; Paul Greengrasss ""United 93"" was shot in a cinema verite style that tried to distance it from Hollywood convention. The meatiest roles were often real people Queen Elizabeth coping with the death of Diana; Idi Amin plunging Uganda into horror; the very real American and Japanese victims of the Battle of Iwo Jima saluted in two Clint Eastwood films; Truman Capote redux. Even the years best musical ""Dreamgirls"" was built on echoes of the true story of Diana Ross and the Supremes. Reality it turned out was stranger--and often more potent--than fiction.Army of Shadows Yes it was made in 1969 but the late Jean-Pierre Melvilles fatalistic masterpiece about the French Resistance starring Lino Ventura and Simone Signoret was never shown in the United States until now. An instant classic.Little Miss Sunshine Pure pleasure--a smart sweet and edgy comedy about our cultural obsession with winning. This indie movie succeeds in something Hollywood used to be able to do and rarely does anymore appeal to everyone. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The Queen Tony Blair vs. Her Majesty perfectly pitched by director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan between satire and sentiment. With the sublimely subtle Helen Mirren in the title role.Letters from Iwo Jima Clint Eastwoods devastating look at the war through Japanese eyes is a companion piece to the fine ""Flags of Our Fathers."" As good as that was this ones even stronger and the rare antiwar movie that never falls into the trap of getting you to root for someones death.The Departed Scorseses supercharged profanely funny wonderfully plotted tale of two moles with an ensemble to die for.Half Nelson A smart wrenching inner-city teacher/student tale that avoids every cliche of the genre. Ryan Goslings performance as a teacher who is both inspiring and self-destructive is about as good as it gets.Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan How long has it been since YOU laughed this hard? Sacha Baron Cohen has come up with a watershed comic event. The backlash just proves how deep a nerve the faux Kazakh journalist has hit.Dreamgirls An exuberant reminder of why we love musicals. Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy bring down the house in Bill Condons grit-and-glitter showbiz epic.Venus Peter OToole dazzles as an old actor in this funny and heartbreaking May-December almost-love story smartly written by Hanif Kureishi and deftly directed by Roger Michell.Volver Almodovar continues his remarkable run of triumphs with this serene melodrama about murder and maternal love with a voluptuous performance from Penelope Cruz.Some other highly recommended movies of the year ""Friends with Money"" ""Time to Leave"" ""Notes on a Scandal"" ""Gabrielle"" ""The Proposition"" ""LEnfant"" ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"" ""Inside Man"" ""The Last King of Scotland"" ""Superman Returns"" ""The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros"" ""World Trade Center"" ""United 93"" ""Casino Royale"" ""Marie Antoinette"" ""Happy Feet"" ""Little Children"" ""Monster House"" ""Children of Men"" ""Kekexili Mountain Patrol"" ""The Syrian Bride"" ""Pans Labyrinth"" ""Prairie Home Companion"" ""Shortbus"" ""Infamous"" ""The Prestige"" ""Factotum"" ""District B-13"" ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" ""The Devil Wears Prada"" ""For Your Consideration"" ""Duck Season"" ""Old Joy"" ""The History Boys"" and David Lynchs baffling mesmerizing maddening haunting ""Inland Empire.""THE BEST NONFICTION FILMSWhen I drew up my list it struck me that the two recurrent themes were war and music. Iraq was the great subject no documentary filmmaker could avoid. And in a time of war we need the music more than ever.Darwins Nightmare It was released in 2005 in some parts of the country; 06 in others. But its too good not to mention. Made by the young Belgian filmmaker Hubert Sauper this devastating work is about the repercussions of the introduction of the Nile perch into Tanzanias Lake Victoria an act that completely alters not only the ecosystem but the economy of the region. But the movie evolves with novelistic richness and no editorializing into a profound and disturbing examination of how the First World exploits Africa and how the export of fish for the fine restaurants of Europe results in the import of arms for war. The work of a real filmmaker with a touch of the poet and a big soul.Deliver Us From Evil There have been several excellent films exploring the molestation scandals in the Roman Catholic Church. Amy Bergs is the best yet a searing indictment of the stonewalling church hierarchy (led by Cardinal Mahoney of Los Angeles who calls to mind a mafia don) and a moving portrait of the victims. Most remarkably Berg got one of the worst offenders the twinkly-eyed sociopath Father Oliver OGrady who molested countless victims for almost 30 years to appear on camera. A chilling portrait of a man in radical self-denial.Iraq in Fragments There were a host of strong documentaries dealing with the war. James Longleys beautifully shot film is not about the U.S. presence and its not a polemic. In three ""fragments"" without commentary it gives us slices of Sunni Shiite and Kurdish life. This eye-opening film shows us what newspapers and TV dont.Shut Up and Sing An intimate rousing fly-on-the wall look at the Dixie Chicks as they figure out how to handle the storm occasioned by lead singer Natalie Mainess anti-Bush remark. Codirected by Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck its tight well-edited and unexpurgated. Chicks haters will find plenty to get mad about. The rest of us will cheer.Dave Chappelles Block Party Why people didnt flock to this soul-stirring joyful movie is a mystery. Its got the beguiling Chappelle as host and ringleader great performances from Jill Scott Kanye West Erykah Badu Lauryn Hill The Fugees Common and John Legend to name a few and it was shot by no less than Michel Gondry. Irresistible.The Ground Truth Patricia Foulkrods shattering expose of the psychic toll the war in Iraq has taken on the men who fight it and how the government often turns its back on them when they return home refusing to acknowledge that they are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorders. A powerhouse of a movie.Crossing the Bridge The Sounds of Istanbul German director Fatih (""Head On"") Akin takes us on a revelatory musical tour of Istanbul from traditional to Turkish hip-hop offering not just great musical delights but a fascinating glimpse into that citys unique and contradictory multicultural identity straddling East and West. I rushed out to buy a Sezen Aksu CD after hearing her unforgettable songs.The War Tapes Iraq again. What makes Deborah Scrantons film unique is that it offers us a view of the war through the eyes of three National Guardsmen who fought there. Each was given a mini-DV camera to film their experience there and upon their return. Heres the real skinny; its not pretty but its essential viewing.Jonestown The Life and Death of Peoples Temple A deeply unsettling portrait of Jim Joness tragic transformation from an idealistic socially progressive Indiana preacher to the megalomaniac drug-addled monster who choreographed the mass suicide of his followers. Stanley Nelsons haunting film informed by the voices of the few survivors of Jonestown can give you nightmares.Neil Young Heart of Gold Jonathan Demmes lovely tribute documents Youngs ""Prairie Wind"" concert at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Filmed just weeks before Youngs operation for a brain aneurysm the film and the concert are haunted by a sense of mortality. Anyone who loves Youngs music will love this; those of a certain age may find it produces repeated lumps in the throat.Once again it was a strong year for documentaries and many other titles deserve mention. Among the highlights ""An Inconvenient Truth""; ""Leonard Cohen Im Your Man""; ""Why We Fight""; ""Abduction The Megumi Yokota Story""; ""Street Fight""; ""God Grew Tired of Us""; ""Heart of the Game""; ""Our Brand is Crisis""; ""Sketches of Frank Gehry""; ""Romantico""; ""My Country My Country""; ""Screamers.""Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Review Borat is most excellent comedy - CNN.com Member Center <a href=""http//audience.cnn.com/services/cnn/memberservices/regwall/member_profile.jsp?source=cnn"">Sign In</a> | <a href=""http//audience.cnn.com/services/cnn/memberservices/member_register.jsp?pid=amp;source=cnnamp;url=http%3A%2F%2Faudience.cnn.com%2Fservices%2Fcnn%2Fmemberservices%2Fregwall%2Fmember_profile.jsp%3Fsource%3Dcnn"">Register</a> International Edition Home World U.S. Weather Business Sports Analysis Politics Law Tech Science Health Entertainment Offbeat Travel Education Specials Autos I-Reports Tools Save | Print | E-mail | Most Popular | Review Borat is most excellent comedy By Tom Charity Special to CNN Adjust font size (CNN) -- ""Borat"" is so gut-bustingly funny it should carry a health warning.If you dont get HBO and remain oblivious to the YouTube viral marketing campaign you need to know that Borat Sagdiyev is a roving reporter the sixth most famous personality in his native Kazakhstan.Tall and skinny with a moustache as thick as his accent Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) appears polite candid and eager to please even as he utters rabidly sexist anti-Semitic and homophobic sentiments. (Watch why theyre not laughing in Kazakhstan -- 234)Baron Cohen is a British comedian (and Cambridge graduate) best known for his alter ego Ali G a mentally challenged rapper who duped a succession of rich and powerful Brits into making fools of themselves on prime time then switched his operations Stateside when he became too famous back home. (He once coaxed Pat Buchanan to agree Saddam used BLTs on the Kurds.)If Ali G suckers the egos and condescension of the elite Borat is a more insidious satirist playing on the courtesy of ordinary folk to expose their latent prejudice. In his most notorious stunt he led a barroom crowd in a singalong of that traditional Kazakh ditty ""Throw the Jew Down the Well.""Like Baron Cohens TV show ""Borat"" the movie has a mockumentary format with Borat gleaning insights into Western culture for the edification of his compatriots often with the aid of interviewees who are definitely not in on the joke.The belly laughs begin with the prologue a rampantly politically incorrect introduction to the peasant village Borat calls home. There inbreeding is rife women are chattel and entertainment comes in the form of poking fun at the disabled or celebrating the ritual ""running of the Jews."" (The government of Kazakhstan has already expressed its displeasure at these outrageous slurs.)Soon Borat is setting off for what he persists in calling ""the U.S. and A."" with producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) in tow.Appropriately enough his first subject is a New York humor consultant who patiently explains that retardation and race are not considered appropriate subjects for comedy. (Too late) Instead he coaches him in the art of ""not"" jokes. Its some mark of Baron Cohens delicious improvisational skills that he makes even this most irritating of comedy tropes funny though -- typically -- it sails over the head of the exasperated expert.But what Borat really wants is to hook up with Pamela Anderson and its when he leaves the East Coast on a transcontinental road trip that the trip really gets interesting. American movies have been testing taboos around bad taste with some vigor over the last decade but ""Borat"" takes bad manners to the level of an art form.Social discomfortIts amazing what this humble Kazakh can get people to do -- or not do.At a dinner with a party of hospitable Southern Christians (who live on Secession Drive) the disarming outsider ""innocently"" makes ever-greater demands on their forbearance. The scene is a tour-de-force of social discomfort and its only when Borat invites a black hooker into the house that his hosts finally draw the line and throw both of them out.A later scene with a group of frat boys ends with them lamenting the demise of slavery.But its at the Imperial Rodeo in Virginia that Baron Cohen enjoys his finest hour. First he elicits anti-Islamic and homophobic comments from the rodeo manager one Bobby Rowe. Then he stands up in front of the entire crowd and delivers a rousing speech pledging support for ""Premier"" Bushs ""the war of terror.""The crowd keeps right on whooping as Borat describes the righteous slaughter that will descend on Arab women and children in increasingly bloodthirsty detail. Their cheers only die out when he massacres ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" by substituting the lyrics of (allegedly) the Kazakh national anthem. Its an extraordinarily brave performance -- so startling that one of the attendant flag-bearers is nearly thrown from his horse.Taken at face value this is certainly the most anti-Semitic American movie ever made -- all the more shocking because Baron Cohen is a devout Jew. But this is a film about racism not a racist film. By saying the unsayable Borat encourages others to do the same with depressing -- but very funny -- results.If there is any justice Sacha Baron Cohen will walk away with this years Academy Award for best actor Pamela Anderson on his arm. Maybe someone should throw in a Pulitzer for undercover reporting too.But for all its hilarity ""Borat"" cuts deep. Satire as everyone from Jonathan Swift to the Onion could note is not a business for the faint of heart. How will this ""cultural learning"" play with mainstream American movie audiences when they realize the joke is predominantly on them?""Borat"" runs 82 minutes and is rated R.

(Multiple values) Photo Twentieth Century Fox REVIEW / Borat explores America finds a very funny place 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan Comedy. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen and Ken Davitian. Directed by Larry Charles. R. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) The first thing that must be said about ""Borat"" is that its screamingly hysterically laugh-through-the-next-joke laugh-for-the-next-week funny. Its so inventive so rich with comic moments so outrageous so shocking and unexpected and so blithely willing to be offensive that it consistently leaves viewers off balance -- and howling. This is a film by an original and significant comic intelligence. [Podcast Mick LaSalle talks ""Borat.""] That comic intelligence is Sacha Baron Cohen who in the persona of Borat a TV newsman from Kazakhstan travels America having encounters with real people who have no idea theyre victims of an elaborate put-on. Borat is not very bright so people condescend to him. He is from another culture so people give him a lot of latitude. Some try to offer advice or color his understanding of what America is about. Borat is ostensibly on a journey to find the real America and ironically Cohen ends up doing just that. Its the something extra that makes ""Borat"" more than just a laugh machine The picture takes the countrys temperature at a rather fraught period in our national life. The America that Borat encounters is by no means a monolith. He heads south and takes driving lessons from a gruff good- natured instructor. He is greeted with open arms by a Pentecostal congregation. In one of the funniest sequences of any movie in recent memory he has dinner with an etiquette instructor and a small group of her friends who try to help him with his table manners. These people demonstrate a patience that is awe-inspiring. But Borat also encounters a lot of bigots creeps and idiots. At a rodeo an old cowboy gives him advice on how to fit in and when Borat tells him that in his country homosexuals are brutally punished by the government the old man tells him ""Thats what were trying to do here."" At the same rodeo he is brought out to sing the national anthem which he prefaces by saying ""We support your war of terror. ... May George Bush drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq."" The crowd cheers -- and only turns on him when he chooses to sing a song about Kazakhstan to the tune of ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" The song offends the crowd by asserting that Kazakhstan is ""the greatest country in the world."" That Borat finds the streak of poison in American life mitigates the potential perception of ""Borat"" as some Muslim-bashing movie for a self-satisfied Western audience. However anti-Semitic misogynistic or homophobic Borat might be he is usually able to find some American to agree with him. In fact Borats bigotry allows the people around him to let their hair down and chime in. Then the trap snaps shut and theyre on 3000 screens talking for example about how in America the minorities have all the advantages. Throughout ""Borat"" Cohen does two things that are striking. The first is that he keeps a straight face even as hes handing a bag of his own excrement to a hostess (while pretending he doesnt know how to use a flush toilet); or telling a group of feminists that women have small brains about ""the size of a squirrel."" The other is that he never breaks character never gives a hint of the intelligent man underneath the mask. At times the temptation must have been overwhelming. Not every moment succeeds. I could have done without the nude wrestling session he has with his obese traveling companion (Ken Davitian) -- a gruesome sight. But thats the risk a comedian takes when hes walking the line between way out and too far. Also the jokes about Kazakhstans poverty have a sour edge. Yet these quibbles are not really offered as caveats but rather as proofs of critical distance so that when I tell you this is even funnier than Woody Allens ""Scoop"" that this is the funniest movie Ive seen all year -- by far -- youll believe it. -- Advisory Strong language gross humor and nudity.

Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) right learns some street slang from an American gang. Photo 20th Century Fox Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Not to put too fine a point on it but Borat Sagdiyev is one sick puppy -- an anti-Semitic misogynistic homophobic racist who loathes gypsies loves Pamela Anderson and gleefully jokes about rape incest bestiality and his award-winning prostitute sister. He defecates in inadvisable public places. He nonconsensually Euro-kisses startled New Yorkers. He says impolitic things in rhapsodically mangled English asking a group of feminists ""Do you theeenk a woman should be educate?"" and singing a Kazakh-centric variation of The Star-Spangled Banner before a howling rodeo crowd. When angry he assaults a friend with gymnastic wrestling holds -- even though both men are very hairy and very naked and (at certain times from certain angles) very privates-partially visible. This also occurs in inadvisable public places. Such is the catastrophic force unleashed in Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan a road-trip mockumentary about an ignorant yo-yo that skewers xenophobia while scoring laughs off same. Its as twisted nauseating politically incorrect and downright scandalous as filmmaking etiquette and/or the R-rating allows. Probably more so. Definitely more so. Fans of the fictitious Kazakhstani TV reporter are already familiar with his immense mustache and boldface bigotry which hold regular spots on HBOs Da Ali GShow. Both Borat and Ali G are creations of the insane British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen whose ability to create florid alter-egos is outstripped only by his ability to expose monumental stupidity among his victims. As Borat his reportorial technique is simple Visit real people blurt asinine questions film their replies. Though some of these interviewees seem friendly enough others come off as world-class jerks (and a few have complained they were duped). By now they realize that baiting people is Borats metier His racist hijinks have sparked outcry from the government of Kazakhstan the European Centre of Antiziganism (i.e. anti-Roma) Research and the Anti-Defamation League. Kazakhstan objects to the unflattering portrayal of Kazakhs. The Roma group has sued to prevent the films release in Germany. And the ADL ill at ease with Borats garish anti-Semiticism has released a statement cautioning movie goers not to mistake the characters bigotry for Cohens. This is key Cohen himself is an observant Jew. When Borat speaks in bogus ""Kazakh"" its actually Hebrew. When he shows clips from an annual ""running of the Jews"" when he flees in terror from Jewish ""cockroaches"" when he asks an ammo salesman ""Whats the best gun to defend from a Jew?"" -- all of these are occasions to gasp at Borats lunacy Cohens audacity and the monstrous intolerance of average people. The best gun Borat learns is a .9mm or a .45. While some of the movies set-ups are familiar from Da Ali G Show assorted screenwriters and director Larry Charles (Masked and Anonymous another road trip of sorts) have cooked up enough raw story to nudge Borat and his producer/camerman/hairy friend Azamat (Ken Davitian) on their wend through ""the U.S. and A."" Expect to laugh uproariously; expect to choke back horror and revulsion often at yourself. But at some point a squicky feeling hit me What if everyone isnt in on the joke? Maybe OK this whole anti-Semitic-mysygonistic-homophobic-racist shtick really is an attack on anti-Semites misogynists homophobes and racists. But what if theyre in the theater? And what if theyre laughing too? If so Im betting theyll miss the irony. And I fear that theyll miss the point. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Unlocked Smartphones at eBay Up to 88% off from 26 + free...

How did Borat get his live rooster in the luggage past U.S. customs? I mean seriously Wouldnt an incoming bantam terrorist be hauled away without habeas cluckus thoroughly de-feathered water- boarded and then slapped around a little by Dick Cheney? Other than that Borats bowel-moving journey from the glorious republic of Kazakhstan to the United States - legendary birthplace of freedom and Pamela Andersons breast implants - is very nice by me. I laughed I cried I immediately used my cellphone to text protests to the Bnai Brith the NAACP and Daughters of the Confederacy. I highly recommend ""Borat"" to anyone like myself with zero emotional I.Q. those with a thick skin for when former friends decide youre a moron by association and the wise people who believe in their souls that ""Jackass"" was shafted for the 2002 Oscar. I cannot recommend it for the pure at heart Uzbeks defenders of wildlife gypsies or anyone living south of the Mason- Dixon line. What is ""Borat"" exactly? Documentary may be the wrong word but call when youve found a better one. Its not exactly fiction - yes Sacha Baron Cohen made up the character of clueless Kazakh journalist Borat. But his movie largely consists of Borat talking to real people who think Borat is a real filmmaker. Its certainly a mockumentary but youre never quite sure whom Borat is mocking the most viciously. Often hes mocking Jews but Cohen is Jewish; often he insults African-Americans but the only person in the movie that he treats with any grace or affection is a black woman who is allegedly a prostitute. What ""Borat"" comes down to then is Cohen stringing together 75 minutes of the crudest jokes possible while quietly slyly handing out enough rope for every bigoted uptight sexist in America to hang themselves with. The scenes start with Borat saying something insensitive hiding behind the modern shield of ""cultural differences."" The same scenes generally end in Borats subjects proving themselves foolish with an ignorance that can only be described as willful. For example Borat at a car dealership beginning negotiations for a vehicle that will take him and his producer cross- country to ask Pamela Andersons hand in marriage. Borat says to the salesman ""I want to buy a car that will attract a woman with shave down below."" Without missing a beat the real-life car salesman responds ""Thatd be a Corvette."" At other times Borat serves as the Central Asian Santa Claus bringing humor to the humorless and waiting to see if they appreciate it. He sits in a studio with a group of feminist leaders in New York and says how remarkable it is to be interviewing them because ""in Kazakhstan it is illegal for more than five women to be in one place except in brothel. Or grave."" The women stalk off stage and Santa is left with his pile of unopened gifts. It should be said in defense of the humorless that many now feel tricked into signing Cohens release forms allowing their blank idiocies to be used in the movie. It may be said in defense of Cohen that any Americans in the age of reality TV and YouTube who naively sign a video release form generally deserve what they get. ""Borat"" began as a skit on Cohens earlier TV shows much like his popular Ali G. character; his movie then plays as a loose series of those skits. The journey to literally bind himself to his beloved ""Baywatch"" star with a traditional Kazakh wedding veil is a thin excuse for vignettes with frat boys Dixie memorabilia dealers humor coaches and etiquette instructors. You should know exactly how crude ""Borat"" becomes before taking the family. This is one of those potty-humor indulgences far closer to NC-17 than its R rating might indicate. My mentioning that Borat at one point carries his own toilet waste to the dinner table in a plastic bag should pretty well clear things up for you fence-sitters. What are we to make of the vilely racist scenes where Borat calls Alan Keyes a ""chocolate face"" or demonstrates his hometowns traditional festival ""The Running of the Jews"" where figures in bloodsucking masks chase victims for their cash? This is Cohen as he was playing the gay French NASCAR driver in ""Talladega Nights"" alternating between bigot and victim to force his audience toward an open-minded equilibrium. The audience I saw ""Borat"" with laughed in the right places and groaned uncomfortably at others giving one hope for the collective conscience. Other audiences though will take the racism at face value as reinforcement of their own bias. I dont think thats Cohens fault. As Borat might say you can lead a horse to water but only in Kazakhstan can you slaughter it and feed the rancid meat to blind orphans.

"Scathingly funny Borat skewers America and its complex values - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Kazakh it to me Scathingly funny Borat skewers America and its complex values By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 3 2006 Lacerating irony has rarely had such a sweet unassuming face as that of Borat Sagdiyev the sixth most famous reporter in Kazakhstan.Crossing America in a repurposed ice cream truck and a shabby gray suit mustache aquiver for the nuances of life in this grand old ""US and A"" Borat maneuvers himself into situations with average Americans -- feminists churchgoers frat boys politicians -- and unloads one frag-bomb of political incorrectness after another. All he asks is that we show ourselves to him in our open-hearted bigoted glory.And we do. Good Lord do we ever. ""Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" is a comic put-on of awe-inspiring crudity and death-defying satire and by a long shot the funniest film of the year. It is ""Jackass"" with a brain and Mark Twain with full frontal male nudity.The enlightened cynicism of H.L. Mencken and Jonathan Swift courses through this movies veins along with the social curiosity of Alexis de Tocqueville the scientific eye of a wildlife biologist and a great comedians love of the unspeakably juvenile.Which is to say I hurt myself laughing at ""Borat"" but Im not sure whether it was from the jokes or from the deep clefts the movie leaves in our national psyche.Borat of course is not Borat at all but Sacha Baron Cohen the British comic and star of HBOs ""Da Ali G Show"" on which the character makes regular appearances. The shtick is simple Borat a descendant of SNLs ""wild and crazy guys"" and Balki from ""Perfect Strangers"" sets up an interview with a subject whos unaware he or she is being spoofed. He asks increasingly outrageous questions and waits patiently for an explosion and because he seems sincere -- and because our parents have raised us to be nice to agreeable foreigners who mangle the English language -- it usually takes a good long while before the interviewees pull the plug.This is ""Candid Camera"" as confrontational art and its both cruel and undeniably funny. Its also revelatory In the lag time before Borats subjects have had enough they tend to say things they might otherwise not. When a GM salesman is asked ""What kind of car will attract a woman who shave down there?"" and without missing a beat responds ""Thatd be the Corvette"" right there is the entire history of automotive advertising in America.Directed with engaging looseness by Larry Charles ""Borat"" is structured as a documentary that sends our intrepid reporter to New York City along with his truculent producer Azamat (Ken Davitian). Their mission is to bring lessons home from the greatest country in the world to help with Kazakhstans major issues ""economic social and Jew."" Borats cheerful unrepentant anti-Semitism is wielded as a double-edged sword one that rubs salt in the wounds of post-Soviet bigotry and all-American racism. (When he finally meets some actual Jews -- in the form of a sweet old couple who run a Bamp;B -- his panic says as much as their obliviousness.) The trick is to take the most indefensible social position and see where people dont agree with it. Once Borat gets a glimpse of Pamela Anderson on late-night TV hes off and running to California to claim his bride and his tour takes him through the deep South . Theres a mind-scorching dinner party with a group of wealthy Alabamans who live on Secession Drive -- Baron Cohen keeps pushing their buttons until he finds the one that makes them scream uncle -- and a rodeo at which he assures the assembled throng that Kazakhstanis ""support your war of terror"" and where Borat finds common ground over the preferred treatment of gay people.I think my favorite scene is the one where a disconsolate Borat -- temporarily separated from Azamat and their bear (dont ask) -- hitches a ride with a group of University of South Carolina frat brothers in an RV. They could be the three faces of American male youth drunk on beer bravado and stupidity. One inveighs against the ""bitches"" that let men down a second goes even deeper into misogyny (you can count his future divorces using both hands) and the third -- the chubby one who the other two probably make fun of behind his back -- cheers this strange little foreigner with heartfelt words of emotional support. There it is Everything that makes this country ugly and great in one Winnebago.Actually I take that back The funniest sequence in ""Borat"" takes place between the newscaster and his producer and when you see it youll know which one I mean. Its not that I dont want to spoil the scene. I just cant describe it without losing my job.Baron Cohen is Jewish and Borats native tongue in the film is a potted enthusiastic mixture of Hebrew and double-talk; in any event hes an authentic Kazakhstani the way Chico Marx was a real Italian. That the government of Kazakhstan has taken umbrage over ""Borat"" is just the icing on the cupcake of a pretty good joke. What makes the film lift off into the ether though is Baron Cohens skills as a master ironist and physical comedian.Hell do anything for a laugh but he never once breaks character -- never winks to let the audience off the hook -- and the most sublime moments come from Borats merrily dense collision with our complicated values. Informed that in this country a woman has the right to choose with whom she has sex he responds with an incredulous ""Whaaat?"" and you almost feel the poor mans pain. Isnt America a beacon of heedless pleasures? Dont we promise freedom fast cars and a porn star in every bed? Wheres the beef?""Borat"" is silliness at its most trenchant and if your sense of irony isnt factory installed youll probably find it horrifying. Take comfort in the thought that we get the cultural commentators and the comedians we deserve and that in Borat and Sacha Baron Cohen we have found our curse and our blessing.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Sacha Baron Cohens stunningly funny mockumentary subtitled ""Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" functions as a sort of Candide Camera focused on and by Borat Sagdiyev a lascivious and blithely bigoted Kazakh journalist who traps hapless Americans into taking him seriously as he crosses the United States in a decrepit ice-cream truck on a voyage of wide-eyed hare-brained discovery. ENLARGE As fans of HBOs ""Da Ali G Show"" already know Borat is one of several alter egos created by Mr. Baron Cohen an English comic actor who uses unveiled insults and brilliantly skewed logic to befuddle real-life interview subjects of all nationalities and persuasions. (Earlier this year he played Jean Girrard the effete French race driver in ""Talladega Nights."") In this film which was directed by Larry Charles the pretext for Borats road trip is a TV documentary meant to explain America to audiences at home. Yet the movie takes flight even before Borat leaves an unreal-life Kazakhstan (actually rural Romania made to look pigsty-poor) where he warns the village rapist ""not too much raping -- humans only"" and where the national answer to the running of the bulls at Pamplona is an annual event called the Running of the Jew. Not surprisingly the real-life Kazakhstan has registered strong complaints and mounted an image-polishing p.r. campaign in the bargain. Still Borats calumnies have been distributed without fear or favor -- among blacks gays women evangelical Christians gypsies fat people fat cats and frat boys as well as Jews (of which Mr. Baron Cohen is one). It isnt clear how many of the people he insults are actors or nonactors given parts to play but it doesnt much matter since the whole thing is inspired fiction. And insult humor isnt the characters only strong suit; if it were the movie would soon wear out its welcome even though the running time is a mere 82 minutes. Whats so appealing about Borat is the ironclad integrity of his idiocy -- mistaking an Oliver Hardy wannabe for Adolf Hitler a yard sale for a gypsy encampment a turtle for a dog an elevator for a hotel room. Never once does the actor step outside his character to comment on him. Its enough that Borat combines an unquenchable jubilance with the lechery of Groucho Marx and the taut anxiety of Alan Arkin. Hes a world traveler who can help replenish the New Worlds dwindling supply of irreverence. Thats the best thing about ""Borat."" Not since the halcyon days of Archie Bunker and ""All in the Family"" has so sharp a wit punctured so many balloons. The film itself ballooned into a phenomenon well before todays opening thanks in large part to Sacha Baron Cohens indefatigable publicity push on its behalf. Does that mean it will be a monster hit? Probably so though who knows. Weve become a society that dotes on outrageousness but also processes it into media Velveeta. And if truth be told about Mr. Baron Cohens vulgarian truth-teller his antics pale now and then. The screenplay which the star wrote with Anthony Hines Peter Baynham and Dan Mazer is a randomish assortment of wonderful remarkably good and not-so-hot comic notions unified mainly by the cross-country trip and by the heros obsession with ""Baywatch"" Malibu and Pamela Anderson who plays herself in a not-so-hot encounter thats more anti than climactic. (Apparently whats on screen was culled from many hours of material that could continue to languish as outtakes or conceivably see the light of day in some different form.) ENLARGE Coming to America Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat Sagdiyev. Another truth is that those antics occasionally go beyond the pale -- not just of good taste but of taste as we know it. The most spectacular example is a scatologically physical battle hideous and hilarious in equal measure between Borat and his producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) who exposes a physique that strongly suggests a Kazakh sumo wrestler. With those caveats on record I urge you to expose yourself to Borat Sagdiyev a twisted De Tocqueville with a peerless gift for showing us ourselves in a fun-house mirror. Volver In his beautiful new ""Volver"" (""To Return"") the filmmaker Pedro Almodovar gives us nothing less than a shaggy ghost story (with the superb Carmen Maura as an undead mother and grandmother); a rueful meditation on the culture of death; a slapstick comedy about disposing of a corpse (Hitchcock in pastels); a celebration of sisterhood strong women and reconciliation (a return therefore to some of the themes of Mr. Almodovars ""All About My Mother""); and at the center of all the swirling action the saga of one blocked angry wife and mother -- Penelope Cruzs Raimunda -- who comes joyously back to life and to an entrepreneurship as a restaurant owner and cook. Raimundas story is the easiest one to follow -- its all about mobilizing her formidable talents when the ground beneath her feet suddenly crumbles -- and Ms. Cruzs performance is the easiest one to dress with a necklace of adjectives dazzling passionate witty and mercurial yet all the while implacably grounded like the legendary Anna Magnani who shows up briefly on a TV screen. Though this is the best work shes ever done Ms. Cruz has been dazzling before most recently in ""All About My Mother."" Youd never know it alas from the English-language films that have squandered her gifts such stinkers as ""Vanilla Sky"" ""Captain Corellis Mandolin"" and ""Woman on Top"" (in which she also played a cook frantically). From the very first shot of ""Volver"" -- women busily cleaning gravestones in a cemetery to which theyll return either living or dead -- you know youre in masterful hands and not just the directors. The cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine who shot the giddy Almodovar comedy ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" 18 years ago works his lyrical pop magic once again. And once again an Almodovar movie stops in its tracks as ""Talk to Her"" did for an enchanted song written by Alberto Iglesias (and sung or rather lip-synched endearingly by Penelope Cruz). Its hard to say if ""Volver"" is a great film -- hard because every woman and girl in it is so damned endearing (the men are either impediments or bystanders to the real business of life) -- but safe to say its right up there with Mr. Almodovars best. The cast includes Yohana Cobo as Paula Raimundas daughter and the delightful Lola Duenas as Sole Raimundas sister who looks like shes seen a ghost long after she knows better.    DVD TIP Penelope Cruzs noble whore Isabel Plaza Caballero gets Mr. Almodovars ""Live Flesh"" (1997) off to a startling start by going into labor and giving birth late at night on a Madrid bus. The plot which picks up many years later and defies description in a paragraph binds five lives with happy or tragic accidents and the mode is intensely erotic. Javier Bardem is David a cop who becomes a national hero as a paraplegic basketball player.

"Sacha Baron Cohens Borat reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sacha Baron Cohens Borat reviewed. Sacha Baron Cohens Borat reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 2 2006 629 PM America Undercover Sacha Baron Cohens disturbing ingenious Borat. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about  Borat  by clicking the arrow on the player below Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. At a Slate party this week a colleague and I got into a discussion of what kind of movie Borat (Twentieth Century Fox) is. Is it a parody? If so what would it be parodying--the horny Kazakh journalists who clog American airwaves with their dirty malapropisms? (Honestly if I have to see one moreof those guys on public-access cable ...) Or is it a filmed reality show like Jackass or Punkd in which nervy obnoxious young men risk their dignity and at times their physical safety for the sheer joy of making fools of themselves and others? I advanced the theory that perhaps Borat belongs to the tradition of the character-based spoof. Think of Peter Sellers in the original Pink Panther series or Mike Myers in the Austin Powers movies comic performances so outsized they make the movie around them seem like mere decoration an excuse for the character to exist. Sacha Baron Cohens palpable physical glee in embodying the bumbling humiliation-proof Borat at times recalls Myers relationship to the furry buck-toothed superspy and Baron Cohens virtuosity with accents and pratfalls can evoke Sellers. Advertisement But in spirit Borat seems closest to last years documentary The Aristocrats which used an old chestnut of a vaudeville joke to investigate the darkest corners of our shared comic consciousness. Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is in a literal sense wildly funny. Its best jokes approach some savage atavistic core of cultural taboo and make the viewer wonder Is it really possible to laugh at this? But by the time you formulate that question its too late Youre already laughing. For those residing in some hype-resistant biospheric dome Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev the Kazakh TV reporter who shows up in New York City with nothing but a few dollars some ""clothings"" and ""a jar of gypsy tears to protect from AIDS"" and undertakes a low-budget television documentary about the exotic mores of the ""U.S. amp; A."" with his producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) by his side. When Borat catches an episode of Baywatch on his hotel TV he conceives a blind passion for Pamela Anderson and resolves to drive to L.A. to kidnap the actress in his bride-bag. The basic Borat MO is familiar to anyone whos watched Da Ali G Show the British (and later HBO) semireality show in which Baron Cohen as one of three different personas interviewed public figures with a deliberate cluelessness that forced his subjects to step outside their usual talking points. (For those who havent had the cringeful pleasure HBO will be running the entire series over the next week.) The faux-doc concept of the movie allows him to expand slightly on that formula mixing real interviews with unsuspecting citizens and scripted conversations between Borat Azamat and other characters played by actors. Pamela Anderson playing herself is a real sport as the object of Borats desire. (Its not clear whether Anderson was in on the actors true identity or not but it seems likely she was having been the butt of his practical jokes before.) In some encounters Borat merely embarrasses his interlocutors as when he returns from the bathroom at a formal dinner party with a plastic bag of his own feces asking where to throw it away. These scenes are funny but one-note; after the initial burst of oh-no-he-didnt shock you start to feel sorry for the victim. But in the films most sobering scenes Borats enthusiastic projection of guileless ignorance somehow compels people to disclose their own deepest fears and prejudices. ""Do you have slaves?"" he asks a group of drunken frat boys who pick him up in their RV. ""I wish"" crows one of the lads. A rancher at a rodeo (where in real life Baron Cohen was nearly assaulted for singing a pro-Kazakh version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"") heartily approves when Borat mentions that gay men in his country are taken out and hung. Does Borat go too far? Its hard to address that question in a movie as ruthlessly piety-demolishing as this one Whatever particular group you choose to stand up for you end up looking like a humorless fool. The Kazakh government has protested the representation of their country as uncivilized. Borats taped response which appears on the official Borat Web site assures his audience that ""I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my governments decision to sue this Jew."" Baron Cohens refusal to give interviews out of character and the strict separation he maintains between self and character in the public milieu functions as a brilliant tactic for simultaneously besting and evading his critics. In essence hes offending himself. If theres any group that might have some legitimate grounds for offense in Borat its one that hasnt made much noise about the film yet fat people. At 82 minutes the movie zooms by with virtually no dead spots--a real rarity in film comedies even the funniest ones. But the films longest set piece and one of the few jokes that drags on too long for my taste is a naked wrestling match between Borat and the morbidly obese Azamat. Its a gay joke and a fat joke at the same time. But while the gay joke is primarily a joke on the audience (got a problem with gay sex? Here watch while one guy shoves his balls in anothers face) the fat joke is a joke on Ken Davitians body. We laugh not only because the sequence is so shamelessly raunchy but because the actors physique is so consummately unappealing. Maybe its just because Im an American woman with the requisite body issues but that makes me feel kind of bad. Borat is directed by Larry Charles a director and producer of many episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm another classic in the I-cant-believe-he-just-said-that comedy canon. But Baron Cohens jaw-dropping gall makes even Curbs Larry David look like a blushing wallflower. Whether you attribute that gall to fearless honesty or shameless crassitude is up to you. Ill just be over here laughing so hard I aspirate my popcorn. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Kazakh Zingers washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Kazakh Zingers An outsider looking in at perverse yet weirdly lovable cultural contradictions Sacha Baron Cohen as fictional journalist Borat reporting on a ""Running of the Jew"" event. (By Rueben Fleischer -- Twentieth Century Fox) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 3 2006 ""Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" arrives with the following disclaimer ""No reputations public images or feelings were harmed in the filming of this production."" Not Welcome to the by turns corny and lethal humor of Borat Sagdiyev the fictional Kazakh journalist who since making his debut on Sacha Baron Cohens HBO program ""Da Ali G Show"" has made a rude specialty of barging into American subcultures and alternately offending or making buffoons of his hosts (mangling the English language all the way). Who can forget the time he led the patrons of a country-western bar in a rousing rendition of ""Throw the Jew Down the Well""? In addition to the hopelessly un-cool ""Not"" ""Jew"" is a favorite Borat punch line but Gypsies and Uzbeks arent much luckier as he haplessly makes a hash of American notions of patriotism pluralism and political correctness. In the comedic tradition of Larry David ""Punkd"" ""South Park"" the late Andy Kaufman and Stephen Colbert Borat pushes humor to its most discomfiting edges eliciting howls and winces in equal measure. The result is a perfect combination of slapstick and satire a Platonic ideal of high- and lowbrow that manages to appeal to our basest common denominators while brilliantly skewering racism anti-Semitism sexism and that peculiarly American affliction were-number-one-ism. In ""Cultural Learnings"" Borat played with seamless disingenuousness by Cohen himself has come to America to make a feature-length documentary for the people of his home country (played by Romania). He embarks on his journey with a producer named Azamat (Ken Davitian) making a triumphant exit from his village in a tiny car drawn by a horse. The teams tour of America begins in New York -- where Borat mistakes a hotel elevator for his room and later meets with a group of feminists (""Give me a smile baby why angry face?""). But soon Borat and Azamat are on their way to California (""Pearl Harbor is there"" Borat explains. ""So is Texas"") which entails a trip through the American South that resembles nothing less than Shermans march as conceived by the writers and editors of the ironic newsweekly the Onion. (Cohens American team shares a suitably snarky-burlesque pedigree Director Larry Charles worked with Larry David on ""Seinfeld"" and producer Jay Roach directed the ""Austin Powers"" and ""Meet the Parents"" franchises.) As Borat cuts his wide and occasionally vicious swath no petard goes unhoisted a spectacle that delivers squeals howls or at least low-level chuckles nearly all the way through. (Its never clear just whos in on the joke raising the same squirmy feelings one sometimes gets watching the fake interviews on ""The Daily Show."") Unlike some television shows-turned-features ""Cultural Learnings"" works as a film with its final payoff every bit as outrageous and funny as its setup. In Virginia Borat earns cheers from a rodeo audience when he announces that Kazakhstan supports Americas ""war of terror."" The applause is just as loud when he adds ""May George Bush drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq"" The carnage continues Borat brings an African American prostitute to a dinner party on Secession Road in Birmingham; breaks hundreds of dollars worth of antiques at a shop in Dallas; and sends kids screaming away from the ice cream truck hes driving when a live bear roars out from the service window (presumably the bear wasnt harmed in the filming of the production). While Borat barnstorms his way through the American heartland -- and more to the point its most cherished myths and assumptions -- his satiric rapier slips only rarely (the woman who helps him operate a toilet in Birmingham seems genuinely sweet). But for the most part were not laughing with but at Borat. When he does let his subjects hang themselves they more than deserve the noose such as a group of racist frat boys he gets drunk with in a camper and earlier a rodeo manager who when Borat tells him that in Kazakhstan gays are jailed and hanged cries ""Thats what were trying to get done here"" (Proving that hes nothing if not ecumenical in his choice of targets Borat eventually visits a Pentecostal church where he pretends to be saved and begins to speak in tongues.) Lest newcomers think that ""Cultural Learnings"" is all subtle political swipes the most hilarious moments are the broadest Borats filthy malapropisms his obsession with prostitutes and bodily functions and the films centerpiece an agonizingly long naked fight scene between Borat and Azamat that makes a sumo wrestling match look like Anna Pavlova performing ""Swan Lake."" Filmed up close and personal to reveal every hairy inch of the two men the scene pays coarse and finally rapturous homage to the courage of doing comedy without a net. When the two men -- still nude and one of them now brandishing a sex toy -- invade what looks like a real-life mortgage brokers conference the sequence levitates from being a mere stunt to a vehicle of sheer catharsis. Why two naked men cavorting in a ballroom full of people should be so transcendent is a mystery for the ages. Suffice it to say that Cohen -- who wrote his Cambridge dissertation on the historic relationship between blacks and Jews in America -- is one of the few artists smart gifted and brave enough to continually raise the physical and political stakes and clear them. And as an outsider looking in at the most perverse hypocritical and weirdly lovable contradictions of the country he calls ""the U S and A"" he seems uniquely qualified to remind us that when theyre not completely appalling American foibles are really pretty funny. Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (89 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for pervasive crude and sexual content including graphic nudity and profanity.

But as cultural satire its also painfully hilarious. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 3 2006 Save for later Saved ""Borat"" should be issued with a warning to all who are squeamish about explicit comedy involving body parts; body odors; racial ethnic and religious stereotypes; bestiality; heterosexuality; homosexuality; pansexuality; Pamela Anderson the Confederacy rodeos hip-hop the Bush administration naked wrestling or the New York subway system.Most of all I would issue this warning ""Borat"" is painfully funny.The film is officially called ""Borat Cultural Learnings of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" and it is the demented brainchild of British comic Sacha Baron Cohen star of HBOs ""Da Ali G Show."" One of his alter egos for that show is Borat Sagdiyev ""Kazakhstans sixth most famous man"" and a journalist - the term is applied very loosely - for the state-run TV network. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? If ever there was a comic character who deserved to be spun off into his own movie its Borat. With his Groucho-esque moustache and gray suit he looks like a man who (at least in his own mind) is ready for prime time. The film directed by ""Seinfeld"" veteran Larry Charles is a mockumentary about Borats trip to America - or as he calls it ""the US and A"" - to learn about our cultural mores. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The odyssey begins in New York but rapidly gets sidetracked when Borat is mesmerized by the sight of Pamela Anderson while watching ""Baywatch"" in his motel. Vowing to meet and marry her Borat and his cameraman-producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) who resembles a human hairball make their way cross country in the only vehicle available to them an ice-cream truck.Cohen and his team of writers sketched this plot outline and then essentially winged it. Most of the movie is a series of unscripted encounters with unsuspecting people who were under the impression they were participating in Borats documentary. Cohen is completely in character throughout even when the situations become so hostile that one fears for his safety.In one instance Borat greets New Yorkers on the street and in the subways in the traditional Kazakh way - big wet kisses - and comes close to being pummeled. In another sequence he and Azamat both flagrantly anti-Semitic flee into the night when they discover they are bunking in the home of an elderly Jewish couple. (Cohen himself is Jewish.)At a Virginia rodeo after cheering the audience on with praises for Americas ""war of terror"" Borat sings the Kazakh national anthem to the tune of ""The Star- Spangled Banner"" and is met with a wall of boos.When he finally meets up with Pamela Anderson at a book signing lets just say that the ensuing confrontation involves a burlap bag.Cohen is a goofball satirist whose comedy draws on everything from ""The Three Stooges"" and ""The Goon Show"" to Peter Sellers and Monty Python. Yet theres never been anybody like him. He has what all great subversive comics have An intuitive grasp of what makes audiences uncomfortable and how far they will go to laugh at themselves.It would be reassuring (and accurate) to note that Cohens comedy untangled is life-affirming and antiracist and pro-peace and all that good stuff. But why spoil the fun? I hate to sound blurby but ""Borat"" is the funniest comedy Ive seen since I dont know when. Grade A Rated R for crude sexual content including graphic nudity and language.Sex/Nudity 18 scenes including frank talk about sex graphic depiction of sexual activity and full-frontal male nudity. Violence 3 comic scenes. Profanity 42 harsh profanities. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 4 scenes with drinking.

"Borat | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; borat ) Borat (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Overwhelmingly positive word of mouth can be a double-edged sword for a filmmaker. Although effusive praise builds anticipation it can also elevate expectations to levels that cannot possibly be met. This is why some viewers who see a movie after it has won a Best Picture Oscar emerge disappointed. It also explains why some late-comers to Borat may find it to be less hilarious than expected. Dont misunderstand Borat is a funny movie and well worth the price of admission regardless of whether your comedy tastes run to low-brow scatological humor or more subtle politically tinged satire. However its hard for any movie to live up to the hype when its being billed as ""the funniest of all-time."" The full name of the film is the intentionally unwieldy Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. This is the only time during the review you will see it referred to by that title. This represents an opportunity for Sacha Baron Cohen to bring one of his three popular personalities from Da Ali G. Show to the big screen. The character Borat is pretty much the same as he is on TV only here he is allowed room to grow and display how truly moronic he is. Of course thats the point. Borat is a fish out of water except the fish never figures out hes stuck on dry land. Borat is like an unlikely marriage between Monty Python and Tom Green. Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a Kazakhstani TV personality who travels to America to make a documentary record of his exploration of American culture. He is accompanied on this endeavor by his producer Azamat (Ken Davitian). Once in New York City Borat navigates the hurdles of settling into his hotel room then discovers Baywatch on late-night TV. He is immediately smitten by a certain blonde in a bathing suit and decides to take a road trip to California to meet her. This episodic journey takes him to Washington D.C. Atlanta through the Deep South to Dallas then finally out to Los Angeles. Along the way he meets characters who are stranger than he is adopts a pet bear and gets into a nude wrestling match with his compatriot. That sequence alone is worth the price of admission since its like a naked Groucho Marx (with an exaggeratedly long black cylinder obscuring his penis) doing battle with an unclothed Fat Bastard. Does Borat find love in the arms of Pamela Anderson? How does he react upon learning that his would-be virginal bride is best known for a role played opposite Tommy Lee? Will his wife ""break [his] cock"" upon learning that hes chasing another woman? How much gas does 17 cents buy? And will he ever figure out what a toilet is for? All these questions and many more are addressed during the course of Borat. Political incorrectness is the watchword here. It has already been documented that the humorless government of Kazakhstan is offended by Borat although the film is far more incisive in its dissection of American culture than that of Kazakhstan. Borat flaunts its main characters anti-Semitic and misogynistic views. There are copious amounts of nudity - all of it male and some of it explicit. One wonders what persuaded the MPAA to dole out an R; is it possible they found Borat funny? Borat is a mixture of staged set pieces and real interviews (in which Cohen adopts the Borat persona and the subjects of the interview are unaware he is an actor). It can turn the movie into something of an intellectual game as viewers attempt to deconstruct the proceedings and determine whats ""real"" and what isnt. No one involved in the production is talking including Cohen (who does all movie-related interviews as Borat). The only statement on record from director Larry Charles (Curb Your Enthusiasm) is that ""its all real."" Its hard to imagine anyone watching Borat and not finding at least a few of its jokes funny. The subject matter is so far-ranging - everything from jabs at George Bush to the scatological and sexual stand-bys - that its difficult to imagine Cohen completely missing anyones funny bone. However those who are prone to be offended by comedy with a rough edge may not be impressed. One of Cohens objectives is to push against boundaries of taste and decency. When that works Borat delivers some of its biggest laughs. Theres a message underlying all of this about the foolishness of bigotry of all sorts. Those who practice anti-Semitism and racism during the course of Borat (including the title character) are shown to be the biggest morons. Is Borat the funniest comedy of the year? Almost certainly - but whats the competition? (Other than Clerks II I cant come up with anything close.) One of the reasons Borat works is because it doesnt belabor its jokes. It delivers the punch-lines then moves on. The movie is set up as a road trip but each stop over has its own set of characters and comedic set pieces. The variation keeps things fresh and the relatively short running length (less than 90 minutes) ensures that Borat doesnt overstay its welcome - even though when its all done we wish this absurd man might have lingered a little longer.

Borat Sagdiyev roving reporter from Kazakhstan (here portrayed as a stone-age enclave of impoverished depravity) is let loose on the US on a fact-finding mission that turns into a cross-country stalking exercise after he glimpses a Baywatch rerun and falls for Pamela Andersons ample charms. En route to California Borat alarms New Yorkers with a live chicken on the subway derails a local TV breakfast show and abetted by his portly producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) engages in a staggeringly public nude wrestling bout that leaves Women in Love quailing in the shade.Plenty to laugh at then and hard. But like Ali G Indahouse the film struggles to adapt an essentially televisual character to the big screen. Both Ali and Borat are terrifically conceived provocateurs capable of coaxing all sorts of damning concessions from the unwitting but theyre pretty thin as characters in their own right. The potential for satire meanwhile is blunted by the narrative demands of a feature which muddy the boundaries between candid-camera revelations and scripted crassness. For every genuine shocker - a rodeo crowd cheering Borats exhortation that George Bush drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq - there are several fish-in-a-barrel moments of feminist-baiting poo jokes and queasily tongue-in-cheek anti-Semitism. Still you cant help but relish the chutzpah of such spectacular obscenities as the running of the Jew a Pamplona-style carnival in Borats village that can only be descibed as jaw-dropping.

A clueless Kazak reporter learns about America in uproariously funny mockumentary ""Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan."" Lead character invented by Brit comedian Sacha Baron Cohen retains an innocent sweetness that mollifies offense his decidedly un-PC remarks might cause. Real-life butt of the pics pranks authentic Kazaks and the terminally humorless wont and already havent seen the funny side. Nevertheless briskly helmed by ""Seinfeld"" producer Larry Charles ""Borat"" should make abundant B.O. benefit for Fox especially among younger auds in the U.S. and Blighty. In the U.K. Cohen and his various alter egos -- white hip-hopper Ali G Borat himself and camp Austrian fashion reporter Bruno -- are practically national icons whose catch-phrases (such as Ali Gs ""Is it because I is black?"") have become common currency. The Borat character reps Cohen at his best. As with Ali G Borats modus operandi is to set himself up as a journalist and interview or interact with unsuspecting folk asking them provocative questions that either shock or embarrass them or in some cases prompt them to reveal their own prejudices. Borat reps a comically distorted third-world country bumpkin whose intentionally backward attitudes have offended some critics and organizations although Cohen (who is Jewish) insists the humor is ironic and that part of his strategy is to expose bigotry and conformity. Pic opens in Borats village an entirely made-up version of Kazakhstan (end credits reveal Romania was used for locations). Talking straight to the camera Borat proudly introduces his fellow villagers (""This is town rapist"" he says pointing out one shifty looking character. ""Naughty naughty"") and family (a blond he kisses full on the lips turn out to be his sister ""the fourth best prostitute in all of country"" Borat proudly reveals as she holds up a trophy.) Its little wonder the Kazak government who have arguably more reason than most to take umbrage with the film has publicly denounced it already although in the end ""Borat"" may end up stimulating the countrys tourism industry more than upcoming Kazak-made blockbuster ""Nomad."" In his capacity as the sixth best-known reporter in Kazakhstan Borat flies to New York with his obese producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) on a vaguely defined brief to interview locals about American customs. While Borat and Azamat are en route to California so Borat can fulfill his secret dream of meeting Pamela Anderson (who gamely plays herself) they stop off at a rodeo. The crowd accustomed to show hospitality to visiting celebrities dutifully applaud when Borat tells them as a Kazak he supports their countrys ""war of terror"" and clap more quizzically when he wishes that ""George Bush may drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq."" The booing only really starts when he starts mangling the national anthem. And so it goes the plot unfolding mostly via a series of vignettes although a vague sense of drama is injected by having Borat and Azamat fall out with each other leading to a masterfully executed slapstick bout of naked man-on-man wrestling complete with an unfeasibly large black censors bar. Meshing nicely with Cohens own precise comic timing the helming credited to Larry Charles (pics previous director Todd Phillips reportedly pulled out halfway through the shoot) has an easy lightness of touch. Not a scene goes by that doesnt generate a laugh or three throughout the pics lean running time. Credit is no doubt due to the pics off-camera crew for maintaining straight faces while filming in order not to give the game away to the unsuspecting subjects. Likewise Cohens seeming powers of improvisation ability to stay in character and still come up with funny lines in hostile conditions impresses throughout. Tech package deliberately assembled to look low-budget is pro. Praise is particularly due to editor Craig Alpert whose cutting consistently enhances comic effect.
