Entertainment Melissa McCarthy Learns To Lean In In ""Spy"" Paul Feigs new comedy is a reminder of just how hilarious -- and poignant -- its leading lady can be. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Jason Statham and Melissa McCarthy in Spy. Larry Horricks / Twentieth Century Fox ID 5883376 Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) the overlooked heroine of Spy is your average office worker. She sits at a desk taking the occasional break for a colleagues birthday cake or happy hour drinks. She has a work bestie Nancy (Call the Midwifes Miranda Hart) as well as a work crush. And she wears the occasional tasteful cardigan. But Susans office happens to be the CIA and her job happens to involve providing support to agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law) via an earpiece while hes out doing perilous things. Still the point stands that Susan is a worker bee sure to be hilariously out of her element when shes thrown into the field.Except not exactly. Spy is written and directed by Bridesmaids Paul Feig who has become a patron saint of not just of putting funny women on screen but creating roles for them that offer the kind of emotional nuance thats rarely bothered with in big comedies. Susan does become an unlikely spy who finds her way onto a mission after Fine goes down and his killer Rayna Boyanov (a strong Rose Byrne who generates laughs while maintaining an expression of just having smelled something terrible) reveals she knows the identity of all of the CIAs active agents. View this image > McCarthy as Susan. Larry Horricks / Twentieth Century Fox ID 5883396 Susan is inexperienced but not inept and Spy -- a haphazard but satisfying comedy with an occasional melancholy streak -- isnt so simple as a fish-out-of-water story about how an analyst ends up floundering her way into an international weapons deal. It is instead the story of someone whos put herself in the corner. Its an espionage spoof but its also a movie about how Susan learns to lean in.McCarthy sells this revelation by playing Susan as initially subdued and wistful a woman whos resigned herself to going unseen. She works closely with Fine whose every word makes her dimple in delight as she guides him through an event in Bulgaria involving tuxedos gunmen and a Baccarat champagne flute drained and hurled dramatically away.When Fine takes Susan out to a thank-you dinner the fact that shes in love with him is as transparent as his platonic but obliviously genuine affection for her. Shes flustered by the high-end restaurant (she tries to eat a hand towel) but shes flustered by the agents in general a glamorous bunch played by Morena Baccarin Will Yun Lee and a scene-stealingly good Jason Statham as Rick Ford the would-be toughest man in the world and the deliverer of several fantastic monologues about his past adventures. View this image > Byrne as Rayna and McCarthy as Susan. Larry Horricks / Twentieth Century Fox ID 5883426 Susan volunteers to help track down Rayna in order to avenge Fine and gets scoffed at and called a ""lunch lady"" when she points out that technically shes a field-certified agent. But when her boss Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) pulls up footage from her training days we see Susans actually pretty damn formidable (and possibly in possession of some rage issues underneath the mild exterior).Elaine immediately guesses that Fine despite being Susans mentor at the academy convinced her to take the support position. ""I really thought he made some great points"" Susan stammers. Fine isnt demonized for recruiting talent he admired but the fact that Susan sidelined herself due to a lack of confidence makes her ungainly transition to country-hopping spook all the more pleasurable. Its not really her doubters who have kept her back -- its that she never tried in the first place.And Spy doesnt allow anything Susan does to be effortless which makes her hard-won triumphs even sweeter. Susan may prove herself a pretty good spy but shes not a dignified or glamorous one. The spy gear shes given is disguised as stool softeners and antifungal spray. Theres a running joke about how every new identity shes assigned is that of a helmet-haired cat lady or unemployed telemarketer (""I look like someones homophobic aunt"" she moans). When she does doll herself up to seduce a swaggering villainous Bobby Cannavale shes ejected from the room before she even gets a chance to try and instead stumbles into Rayna who tells Susan her ""hideous dress"" is ""just hysterical."" View this image > Larry Horricks / Twentieth Century Fox ID 5883444 Its actually something of a letdown when McCarthy makes the transition into a variation on the self-assured bruiser thats made her famous in past comedies like Bridesmaids and The Heat which is also from Feig. Yes its funny when she bellows and bashes people but its also familiar while the long-suffering type Susans been until that point has been so sharply bittersweetly entertaining. But even when shes being tough Susan is denied the chance to look cool -- the most memorable of the movies fight scenes takes place in a kitchen and finds her fending off a baddie with a baguette and a skillet. She doesnt get to be delicate and she doesnt get to be daunting but she does get the job done.The best part of Spy is that its immensely fond of its main character without giving her too sugarcoated a journey. Shes no Mata Hari and she may not get the guy (though she does get some) -- but that doesnt mean she cant be a different sort of badass the kind thats a reminder of McCarthys range beyond just physical comedy. Its all that concern about being the right type that can keep a girl from trying in the first place. Besides no one suspects the cat lady.

She plays Susan Cooper a C.I.A. agent with great combat skills whose low self-esteem relegates her to a desk job as the video eyes of the suave and daring field agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law) on whom she has an unrequited crush. When hes killed in an effort to thwart the sale of a stolen nuclear device Susan volunteers for action to take his place. She pursues a diabolical criminal (Rose Byrne) to Paris Rome and Budapest and Feig delights in the picturesque settings but McCarthys performance fitting the character remains frumpily empathetic until late in the film. Susans emergency improvisation to get out of a jam lets McCarthy lunge into the potty-mouthed persona of a paramilitary ass-kicker. Her spew of invective and uninhibited aggression is recklessly hilarious but all too brief.

Comments click to enlarge Spy Video Rated R  120 minutes  2015 Hollywood is gradually figuring out what to do with Melissa McCarthy. Following her breakout performance in Bridesmaids (2011) she played obnoxious characters in Identity Thief and The Heat but this espionage comedy from Bridesmaids director Paul Feig gives her a softer more agreeable and no less funny character. She plays a CIA desk jockey improbably assigned to track down a missing nuke and the roughhouse gags all play on her vulnerability physical and otherwise. At two hours this is too slackly edited for a spy adventure though the rangey running time allows for plenty of Apatow-like character work from McCarthy and British comic actress Miranda Hart as the heroines goony pal at the agency.

McCarthy is keenly aware that some people will always view her as a joke - a brash trash-talking but essentially sexless person who resembles Santa Claus wife (as Jason Stathams hard-boiled spook character observes in this movie). This may be more than balanced out to be sure by those in the audience who identify with her and root for her joyously. Personally Ive often found her comic persona overly aggressive cranked to 11 too much of the time but thats a different question from her cultural significance. McCarthys seemingly unlikely rise to stardom is more important than any of her individual projects; it belongs to a much broader cultural pattern of tolerance and acceptance that encompasses same-sex matrimony and ""Modern Family"" and Caitlyn Jenner and a whole bunch of other stuff.McCarthys success has been largely based on her skill in addressing both sides of the audience equation at once. Weve all noticed that she does not physically resemble any previous Hollywood star; her comedy always acknowledges that incongruity and shes more than willing to make jokes at her own expense. But McCarthys triumph within the movie or at the box office or in the culture proclaims repeatedly and ferociously that shes not an object of pity or pathos (and not a ""sad Bulgarian clown"" as Rose Byrne the ice-queen villainess of ""Spy"" describes her). This movie is literally littered with the corpses of those who take McCarthys character lightly or treat her as a punch line.In the wake of the surprise Feig-McCarthy hit ""The Heat"" from two summers ago theyve gotten a bunch more money ritzier locations and a cast loaded with stars this time around. ""Spy"" is still an extremely silly movie with no claims of realism but it has quite a few decent giggles along with delightful supporting turns from Statham Jude Law Allison Janney and especially Byrne as the skinny uber-bitch comic foil to McCarthys implausible spy heroine. For my money the complicated intersection between jokes at McCarthys expense - her undercover identities often seem to involve multiple cats egregious holiday sweaters and elaborate crafting hobbies - and jokes at the expense of those who misjudge or underestimate her is handled far more adroitly here than in ""The Heat."" It helps that this movie doesnt think police brutality is hilarious and that it lacks the nails-on-chalkboard comedy stylings of Sandra Bullock.McCarthy plays Susan Cooper a desk-bound CIA agent who spends most of her time in the agencys vermin-infested basement - somehow the idea that Langley has recurring bat and mouse problems keeps on being funny - serving as the high-tech eyes and ears of glamorous field agent Bradley Fine (Law) on whom she has an ill-disguised and hopeless crush. Fine is a delicately managed caricature a highly competent daredevil just slightly too aware how good he looks in a tailored suit and how well he speaks French to sommeliers. Both Law and Statham in fact are playing exaggerated version of the guys theyve played many times The latter is very funny as an oafish belligerent agent constantly declaiming about all the outrageous Gordon Liddy-style things hes done which include limb-reattachment surgery (on himself) parachuting off a skyscraper using only a raincoat and appearing before Congress as Barack Obama. (""In blackface?"" asks Susan. ""Thats not appropriate."") You Might Also Like When her beloved Fine disappears into the clutches of Rayna Boyanov (Byrne) a nefarious Bulgarian black marketeer with an English finishing-school accent and an impeccable wardrobe Susan is of course sent into the field herself. Because no one who looks like her could ever be a kickass international spy ha ha and the bad guys will never suspect the weird-looking lady with the Midwestern accent and the tent-like garments. Well at least they wont until Susan saves Paris from a major terrorist bombing and intervenes not once but twice to stop assassination attempts against the mean but undeniably beautiful Rayna. Somewhere along the way to becoming a full-on international badass Susan ditches the crocheted tops for leather nightclub gear and goes from saying ""Jeepers Christmas"" and ""son of a beesting"" to cursing like a whorehouse rat.It takes a while for the odd chemistry between Byrne and McCarthy to warm up - especially since the idea is that they view each other with utter contempt - but in many ways the relationship between the skinny bitchy ultra-chic terrorism-enabler and the regular-gal American heroine is at the heart of ""Spy."" Well theres also Susans dorky English sidekick Nancy (Miranda Hart) -- and why are all these British people in the CIA? Dont they have their own rights-subverting spook agency to run? - who shows up at inopportune moments cannot shut up and literally climbs on top of ""50 Cent Piece"" as she calls him when that person gratuitously appears late in the film. A little bit of Nancy goes a long way whereas I wanted more of the scorn ridicule and begrudging respect between Susan and Rayna. But even in a story this preposterous Feig cant go too far in making a Bulgarian arms dealer whos shopping a suitcase nuke to Americas enemies into Melissa McCarthys BFF. We have to get something approaching a patriotic happy ending that doesnt kill off anyone important and leaves the door open for sequels. I was dreading the prospect of more ""Heat"" movies with more brittle gags about Bullock and McCarthys relative attractiveness but another movie in this vein especially if the supporting cast all return would be entirely painless. McCarthy has much more to discover about herself as an actor and an avatar and a cultural signifier and I hope she doesnt get trapped by one role one genre or one franchise. But her campaign of conquest is going well. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Larry Horricks/ Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Larry Horricks/ Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Melissa McCarthy gets a star-vehicle movie of her own in Spy. Larry Horricks/ Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox The first time Melissa McCarthy worked with director Paul Feig she had a bit part in his comedy Bridesmaids. The second time they worked together in the police-comedy The Heat McCarthy got equal billing with co-star Sandra Bullock. Now in Spy a globe-trotting action comedy that proves to be an ideal star-vehicle McCarthys finally billed above the title. Long time coming. Worth the wait. Spy begins with a sequence crafted to look like a Bond flick -- smooth tracking shots across a lake to a mansion where tuxedos and gowns predominate and gunmen lurk behind every bush. McCarthys CIA agent Susan Cooper is pointedly not there. She may have graduated at the top of her class but 10 years in shes at the bottom of the espionage heap -- literally in a vermin-infested basement surrounded by high-tech surveillance gear talking into another agents earpiece half a world away. Indispensable and unsung her guidance is what makes this guy played by Jude Law a ""double-oh-seven"" of sorts and he repays her with flirty ""couldnt-do-it-without-you"" chatter and a promise of dinner when he returns. But his idea of a thank you gift is a hideous cupcake pendant because like the rest of the Agency he condescends to her. And thats still true when an assassin blows everyones elses cover and the Agency needs someone unknown to track a nuclear device. Cooper lands the assignment but not the glamour. Her alias Frumpy housewife from Iowa. Her secret gadgets Things a frumpy housewife from Iowa might carry in her purse -- anti-fungal cream that doubles as mace chloroformed hemorrhoid wipes. Lots of chloroformed hemorrhoid wipes. Happily out in the field Cooper comes into her own glamming herself up on her own dime and going head-to-head with Rose Byrnes femme fatale while fighting off help from Jason Stathams meathead of an ally and fending off Peter Serafinowiczs amorous CIA driver who has a thing for plus-size gals. Feigs cheerfully feminist script makes only as much sense as it absolutely must while providing McCarthy with chances to crack wise show vulnerability and class and do some of the more elegant pratfalls youll have seen in a while -- always in character. Movie Reviews A Satisfying Spy Proves Theres Life In The Secret Agent Send-Up And though Spy has clearly been designed around her talents it also makes room for a nifty supporting cast Allison Janney as her angry boss; a loose funny 50 Cent as himself; Miranda Hart as a tall slender and hilarious Laurel to McCarthys full-figured Hardy. It is in short a generous smart sexy comedy surrounding this generous smart sexy star. About time.

"Killing It Spy and Sharing Comedic Wealth; Plus the Masturbatory Entourage << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Killing It Spy and Sharing Comedic Wealth; Plus the Masturbatory Entourage Twentieth Century Fox Movies June 5 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print At comedies I usually keep a tally of the number of times I laugh. I lost track at Paul Feigs Spy. Laughing at this movie became a form of exercise. You dont need crunches when youve got this. Loosely its an espionage-movie spoof but the spoof isnt what makes it special. Its a pretext to throw a party. Feig might be the most generous director in American comedies. I dont know whether he thinks we all can be funny but he seems to believe that everybody in his movies can be. Here that spirit stretches from the films star Melissa McCarthy all the way down to the people playing the couple simulating a blow job in a cutaway to a darkened Parisian street. That kind of comedic egalitarianism hasnt been too fashionable since Mel Brooks. But if a film has the talent and the writing its a great joke strategy because an audience wont know where the next laugh is coming from just that it can leap out from anywhere. At least twice in Spy vermin infest the CIA bunker where desk analysts toil and its such a random stupid thing to do (bats in the hair and rodents on equipment) that it just works. For one thing each actor has a different reaction and the reactions crack you up. Amid the chaos Feig cuts to a pert blonde analyst played by Jessica Chaffin who sits in front of her monitor and deadpans ""Theres a mouse on my tit."" Its shameless but shes a hoot. The setting is a kind of CIA/James Bond-style world in which Jude Law puts on a tuxedo and an American accent and tosses around Bulgarian thugs with the same alacrity that he uses to toss his hair. (His character is a studly dope named Bradley Fine.) All the while McCarthys dowdy antic analyst Susan Cooper speaks into his earpiece; shes a kind of periscope thanks to an impossible surveillance system who can warn him of assassins around every corner. This is all somewhat standard secret-agent-movie stuff. The action has that slowed-down-then-sped-up slingshot quality you get from Hong Kong Luc Besson and sports replays. Its taken seriously enough. But Feig is constantly looking for ways to laugh at other conventions. When Susan tells Bradley someones coming hes so grateful that he says he could kiss her. She says ""I would accept that with an open mouth."" Bradley finds his human target a baddie who knows the whereabouts of a nuclear bomb. As the guy is running his mouth hes shot in the head and theres a cut to Law holding what basically is a smoking gun. He tells Susan that he took the shot by accident. You see his allergies have been terrible this whole trip. The joke between them is that he flirts with her without realizing that shes in love with him. He treats her like an assistant and she has to suppress the urge to mount him. At dinner one night shes thrilled when he pulls out a jewelry case only to find out hes offering her just a pathetic cupcake necklace. (In a change of pace for a Melissa McCarthy movie she knows its pathetic too.) A few minutes later Bradley is murdered by a crime heiress (Rose Byrne) who blows the cover of the CIAs other undercover agents and is trying to sell that nuke to a slutty Italian (Bobby Cannavale). So the agency director (Allison Janney) reluctantly sends a heartbroken and pinkeye-suffering Susan to Europe to do reconnaissance. Like the bats and rats the pinkeye is probably unnecessary. But these arbitrary bits are parapets from which the cast can do terrific sniping. Janney has a field day obscenely berating McCarthy who barely objects to the abuse. Vulgarity proliferates in Bridesmaids and The Heat the other two films Feig has made with McCarthy. He somehow modulates it enough that it manages to endear itself. Every other word that the cocky agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) says in his gnarly English street accent is obscene. But the character is such a good joke on the macho superagent -- and on Statham himself -- that you hear his profanity the way you hear ""if"" ""and"" or ""but."" Stathams recent mock-heel turn has been stiletto-like in its fineness. If hes going to be a goon as he also was in Furious 7 best to do it with a smirk. Stathams hilarity speaks explicitly to the Feig mission. Another movie would have kept him playing straight to keep McCarthys lane clear. But comedically Feig is working on a boulevard. Theres a lane for everybody but he also thinks its funny to have different personalities crash into each other. So when McCarthy and Statham argue they do so with gags and put-downs. The same goes for McCarthy and Byrne whose character Rayna warily befriends Susan. Rayna is a London-educated Bulgarian with piles of money and hair and lots of chintzy skintight couture. She looks like a supermodel in a Borat-style parody of fashion a complete conflation of Bond villain and Bond girl. Its the best funniest thing Byrnes been allowed to do at the movies. She has a similarly snooty role in Bridesmaids but there the joke was on the character. Here the character is the joke and Byrnes calibration of bad snobbery is perfectly arid. The fun of the movie is all the parrying being done among the characters. Rayna mocks Susans evening gown. When Rayna is pushed to the ground Susan quips in McCarthys mock-polite Illinois accent ""Thank god your hair broke your fall."" The movie isnt rigged for McCarthy to win every bout. Most of the time she risks being upstaged by Miranda Hart and Peter Serafinowicz two British comedians. Hart plays Susans best chum Nancy a fellow analyst whos lanky plain and bluntly honest. In Europe she becomes Susans sidekick and gets tangled up in a side plot with 50 Cent. Ive never seen Harts BBC show Miranda but it seems like the source of her power as a funny person is her elevated self-regard. She at least is impressed with herself. Serafinowicz is a ham. He plays Aldo Susans greasy driver in Rome and his comedic objective is to drive her crazy with sexual harassment. Both he and Hart are happy revelations to me though I imagine that this movies British audience will know what theyre in for. Feig might be the first director who is getting away with the Muppets idea of comedy in a non-Muppets movie. Normally Id tire of all the laughing and there was a moment during the second half when I had to stop for my health. I took the break to reappreciate McCarthy. As female comedy stars go she is unusual; only Bette Midler and Whoopi Goldberg have as many pitches of profanity as McCarthy does. But she also has that quality that a lot of star comedians have in which audiences laugh before shes even done anything. Watching her in something like Identity Thief was painful because there was no one to tell her that her coarseness and vulgarity were obnoxious. The movie was laughing at her and the audience obliged. But there and in last summers Tammy which she cowrote and her husband Ben Falcone directed McCarthy played a sad mocking part that dumped gags all over her. Feig appears to adore McCarthy. He doesnt treat her like a clown. When she works with him she can risk being obnoxious because he comes up with sensible environments for her excesses or in an uptight Sandra Bullock the ideal foil. In Spy shes playing a caricature that is almost a complete character. The movie isnt out to humiliate her. It wants to prop up a version of heroism that makes sense for McCarthy rude exasperated unstable. The CIA keeps giving Susan anti-glamorous disguises (""I look like somebodys homophobic aunt"" she says of one) and such insulting toys as a Beaches watch and stool softener. But theres a rewarding logic to them. And in Rome McCarthy arrives at a ball in a beautiful contessa disguise looking very much like McCarthy herself. Shes a new woman both the character and especially the comedian. You feel the power of her insults and come-ons as she moves around this glamorous Bond-parody interlude and you sense another proven direction for her persona to go West. Mae West.  Warner Bros. I think we can agree that masturbation has nothing to do with you. Thats Entourage five adult adolescents jerking off for their more famous friends. Its not a movie per se but 104 minutes of jizz. As a half-hour show on HBO it lasted for eight seasons and overstayed its welcome by at least five. Now Vince the actor it appears has directed a movie for Aris studio and is nervous about letting anyone see it. Thats it. Thats the whole story. Will the Texan whos bankrolled it pull the plug? Will Erics serial monogamy -- and arguable sex addiction -- lead him back to his pregnant baby mama? Will Ronda Rousey make Turtle tap out? Will Drama stop looking like hes having a bowel movement? A gay wedding is cooked up so Aris former assistant Lloyd can resume his appeals to his ex-bosss bigotry. Aris current assistant is never right and always cringing which if I were Kid Cudi who plays the assistant is probably what Id do too. And celebrities pop up like the plastic rodents in a Whack-a-Mole console. T.I. Jessica Alba Warren Buffett Liam Neeson Kelsey Grammer To a person theyre in a foul mood. Mark Wahlberg created the show. He strolls into and out of one scene leaving a cloud of smoke that more or less reads ""Go see Ted 2."" The cameos are what appear to be making people say wow as my seatmate a stranger did at a screening the other day. In that sense the film is like a tabloid that turns its own pages. The cynicism here accounts for the appalling low of this movie. It lacks the will mandate and talent even to attempt filmed entertainment. It just keeps shitting stars. Theres neither a satire of Hollywood delusion to speak of nor a farce of entertainment excess -- despite the holy presentation of the model and actress Emily Ratajkowski as a combination of Angelina Jolie Julia Roberts and a walking Viagra dispenser. Entourage is the deluded bloat itself. Vinces project is something called Hyde and its as desperately anticipated as even the crumbs are for a new Star Wars movie. You dont know why its worth the bother. The Texan (Billy Bob Thornton) has dispatched his grubby hick son (Haley Joel Osment) to look at the film of which we see only a single sequence. It looks as if he turned the recent Ferguson protests into a Sprite commercial. The son has some concerns but what does he know? Hes a grubby hick. These guys are going to ... the Golden Globes Right now San Andreas is also reducing Los Angeles to a hideous essence. The title character opens its maw and indiscriminately sucks down whatever crap is in its vicinity. But given that Entourage exists Id say it missed some.

Melissa McCarthy to receive MTVs Comedic Genius Award On her own Melissa McCarthy is hilarious. So is Rose Byrne. Together theyre spectacularly funny. That seems to be the key to Spy an espionage spoof that also finds Jude Law and Jason Statham crushing it in roles that send up their established movie personae. Spy is hugely entertaining throughout but the comic chemistry between McCarthy and Byrne accounts for several standout moments. Writer/director Paul Feig (The Heat; Bridesmaids) keeps things moving along briskly with a combination of action and laugh-out-loud silliness. McCarthy stars as Susan Cooper a mild-mannered CIA agent whose work entails sitting at a desk and using her genius to guide a male agent the debonair Bradley Fine (Jude Law) through the dangers of his work in the field. Then opportunity knocks. The chilly and dangerous Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) a villain with a nuclear weapon to sell knows every available CIA agent by sight. She must be stopped but only someone shes never encountered before will be able to infiltrate her inner circle. Sounds like a job for Susan Cooper. En route to becoming a full-on agent our Susan has to change a few minds. First theres her co-worker Rick Ford (Jason Statham) a macho spy whose history makes James Bond look like an intern. He doesnt think Susan can handle it. Every time Ford opens his mouth its to relate past exploits of increasing danger and hyperbole; Statham here fearlessly mocks every tough guy role hes ever played and hes terrific. Susan is underestimated by almost everyone including her boss (Allison Janney) and her best friend (Miranda Hart). Initially shes sent out into the field as an observer only and her new identity is as unthreatening as her real identity. Even her nifty spy gadgets are disguised as embarrassing drugstore items. Then Susan gets to step up her game and get close to the wicked Rayna and Spy thereafter goes into high gear. Armed with a gun and her Olympic-level capacity for creative insults Susan shows shes unafraid of anything the espionage world can throw at her. McCarthy is really dazzling in Spy. She slaps people down with her fists as well as her tongue engaging in some hand-to-hand combat that manages to be both impressive and very funny. And sunny. Theres a particular good-naturedness about McCarthy (in real life and on the screen) that lends shock value to her insults and somehow amplifies the joke here when shes spittin mad and threatening the bad guys. Even when Susan Cooper is at her angriest and most ferocious theres still an innocence about the character that lets McCarthy get away with a lot and keep an audience onside. Basically the woman is a genius. Otherwise Spy offers some amusing running gags and visual jokes -- from errant mice to a lecherous Italian agent (Peter Serafinowicz) and on to cameos from 50 Cent and Bobby Cannavale. Theres all kinds of craziness going on in the corners. Spy is clever outrageous fun and itll leave you looking forward to whatever Melissa McCarthy and filmmaker Paul Feig come up with next which just happens to be next summers Ghostbusters reboot.

She can play obscenely hostile. But for a while now what too many comedies have asked her to play is just well gross. Admitted McCarthy has had less of a problem with it than some of her fans did. In fact she and her husband wrote and he directed ""Tammy"" one of the worst of these farces. So if she didnt mind the fat jokes why should we? Except we knew she could always do - and always has done - more. Which is why seeing her in ""Spy"" is a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately seeing ""Spy"" itself isnt quite as much fun. Jason Statham overplays his comic role Rose Byrnes villain isnt as comic as she needs to be and some of the plot never does make sense. A major character shift -- with McCarthy going from barely saying ""Gosh"" to suddenly dropping F-bombs -- comes out of nowhere. But its still good that it arrives because it turns what could have been another Poor Melissa movie into a little empowerment fable. The story has McCarthy playing Susan Cooper a sort of back-office assistant to in-the-field superspy Jude Law. Then hes killed in action and by someone whos clearly cracked the identities of all the CIAs agents. Who can the agency send out now? Who do they have who nobodys heard of who nobody would ever even suspect? And why are they looking at Susan sitting over there in the corner? The film - which begins nicely in faux-Bond fashion complete with jazzy credits sequence - quickly sends McCarthy out into Paris Rome and Budapest (well mostly budget-friendly Budapest) in pursuit of the vicious Byrne and Cannavale and with fellow agent Statham tagging along (and mostly getting in her way). But the performances are all over the place. Law plays his sleekly arrogant spy well (and Allison Janney is very good as the CIAs humorless deputy chief). But Byrne doesnt do much with the villain and Statham does too much with his hero - hes supposed to be ridiculously intense but hes so over the top hes down the other side and round the bend. And Cannavale as a millionaire international arms dealer? Who twirls a silver-topped cane? Get outta here. They can dress him up anyway they want but Bobby C always seems like someone you interrupted washing his Camaro. In his boxers. And the movie is missing a crucial scene. At the start of the movie we see McCarthy as the way too many films show her - the self-deprecating loser. And then she becomes the way we like to see her - as the stick-up-for-herself fighter who can spew insults that would peel paint. But how does one become the other? Wheres the big transformation? Its as if filmmaker Paul Feig forgot to write it. He writes McCarthy some other good material though (or she improvises it - shes always played dialogue like jazz solos). He stages some genuinely well-done hand-to-hand fights too lightly tips his hat to ""Goldfinger"" and gives McCarthy a couple of comic but genuine love interests. So ""Spy"" - while no ""Bridesmaids"" - does have its moments and it does have McCarthy. And while its not worth much more than a rent it does make us look forward to what shes going to do with ""Ghostbusters."" Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual material and gory violence. Spy (R) Fox (120 min.) Directed by Paul Feig. With Melissa McCarthy Jason Statham Jude Law Rose Byrne.

She can rely too much on physical comedy and self-shaming. She can hit flat notes and become repetitive.And she can be outright hilarious which she is in writer-director Paul Feigs ""Spy"" a looney send-up of espionage thrillers that gives McCarthy plenty of room to move play against stereotypes and -- surprisingly -- kick butt.Feig has had huge success directing McCarthy previously -- in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat"" -- but this time hes done her the extra service of writing for her (its his first film screenplay in 12 years) and he proves what comics need more than timing funny costumes mismatched buddies or pratfalls is simply good jokes. ""Spy"" has plenty of them along with lots of genre-appropriate action.It certainly helps that McCarthy has a game supporting cast. Her ""Bridesmaids"" co-star Rose Byrne is along as a wonderfully catty bouffant-bearing bad girl and Jude Law plays it fairly straight as a debonair Bond type. The big surprises are Jason Statham playing a wonderfully self-obsessed version of his normal tough guy and British actress Miranda Hart (""Call the Midwife"") effortlessly stealing scenes as McCarthys BFF.McCarthy plays Susan Cooper a desk-bound CIA agent who monitors and directs the actions of superspy Bradley Fine (Law). A nuclear bomb is missing and its thought to be in the hands of the exotic Rayna Boyanov (Byrne) who intends to sell it to terrorists who want to attack New York City (doesnt anyone ever want to attack Des Moines?).Cooper is watching from Washington as Fine approaches Boyanovs lair. At which point Boyanov shoots Fine -- who Coopers secretly in love with -- in the head.It turns out Boyanov knows the faces of all the CIAs top agents including the volatile Rick Ford (Statham so beautifully over-the-top). So the agency must try and track her with an unknown face. Enter Susan Cooper.This is where the film takes a nice right turn and its a turn it follows to the end. Instead of making Cooper a secretarial doormat who bumblingly comes alive somehow when faced with danger it makes her a thoroughly capable killing machine whos just never been placed in the field. Unlike so many spy comedies in which an idiot hero falls forward thanks to unlikely circumstance Susan Cooper is progressively revealed as a fully competent fast-thinking hard-hitting woman who can hold her own with the best and worst.""Spy"" plays with all the genre conventions -- globetrotting (Paris Rome Budapest) a scene in a casino assorted chase scenes and assassinations and the magnificent Byrne -- is there a better female comic foil working? -- offers up a heartless petulant insult-spewing villain to die for. The film is always having fun but its acrobatic fight scenes -- especially one in which Cooper brings a frying pan to a knife fight -- are impressively choreographed.Obviously ""Spy"" is nothing more than a bit of summer comedy piffle but its summer comedy piffle done right. As last years disastrous ""Tammy"" showed McCarthy is not a one-size-fits-all talent; she needs the right vehicle. Here Feig has given her precisely the right vehicle and she shines.SpyGRADE BRated R for language throughout violence and some sexual content including brief graphic nudityRunning time 120 minutes 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1M9pVLP MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/06/04/movie-review-seemingly-inept-melissa-mccarthy-kills-spy/28503055/,200,spy10,spy,detroitnews

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 05 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 05 2015 838AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Paul Feig Written by Paul Feig Starring Melissa McCarthy Jason Statham Rose Byrne Jude Law Year 2015 Country USA Language English In the new action-comedy Spy Melissa McCarthy gets the kind of double-barreled role she was born to play Part cherubic auntie part two-fisted biker mama on the rampage.McCarthy who burst out in Paul Feigs 2011 breakthrough R-rated comedy Bridesmaids has been an undeniable but underdeveloped resource An immensely likeable star who can perform precision slapstick comedy with her non-conformist body and dazzle with her motormouth power-riffing she has been the best part of a string of recent mediocre buddy comedies including Identity Thief (with Jason Bateman) Tammy (with Susan Sarandon) and Feigs The Heat (with Sandra Bullock). Spy a boisterous feminine-centric secret-agent spoof is her first unshared starring role and she rocks it. McCarthys character of CIA office drudge Susan Cooper is to use the word of former president George W. Bush someone who is easy to ""misunderestimate."" A fortyish desk-bound employee she labours in a crappy vermin-ridden basement office in Langley Va. where her job is making other people look brilliant.In the extended opening sequence we watch as Susan through her computer screen and an earpiece guides suave James Bond-like agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law) through a Bulgarian mansion in search of a stolen nuclear device. As Susan feeds him intelligence from surveillance devices Bradley makes his way through a maze of corridors shooting chopping and kicking his way through an army of goons toward his target.One reason Susan is so vigilant in protecting the agencys star asset is that shes hopelessly and unrequitedly in love with the man. Bradley in an echo of the Bond-Miss Moneypenny relationship reciprocates with a little condescending flirtation while treating her like a factotum.But things change abruptly when Bradleys flashy career gets abruptly terminated by Rayna Boyanov (Feig regular Rose Byrne) the glamorous daughter of a recently killed Bulgarian baddie who catches the spy-guy in her fathers home. In a fiendish flourish Rayna who sports a scarlet slash of lipstick and a gravity-defying birds nest of hair looks into Bradleys contact-lens cam and warns the CIA that she knows the identities of all their top agents - so they had better back off or watch the body count rise.A grief-stricken Susan wants a chance for revenge and with no other options Susans skeptical CIA superior (Allison Janney) agrees to put her into the field. A macho fellow agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham who does a great job sending up his own hammer-headed Cockney persona) resigns in protest. He then decides to ""go rogue"" to establish his superior credibility and spends the rest of the movie finding ways to get in Susans way.After Susans initial excitement about getting sent to Europe on a top mission she begins to adjust to the demeaning reality. Shes set up in a divey Paris hotel and presented with a series of frumpy Middle-American tourist disguises which include muffin-shaped wigs and cat-print sweatshirts (""I look like someones homophobic aunt"" she protests). Even her spy kit is lamentably unglamorous (stool softeners rape whistle).Although this fish-out-of-water scenario might sound over-familiar both the humour and action here are startling and visceral The first time Susan sends an enemy goon tumbling to his death she looks down at the impaled body and emits a stream of vomit. Throughout writer-director Feig changes the tone deftly tightroping between a plausibly suspenseful action film and a comedy where the characters are all the more funny for playing their ridiculous characters straight.The emotional core is provided by McCarthys Susan a professional people-pleaser who has been habitually treated like office furniture and who surprises everyone including herself when she taps into her bottled-up gift for aggression.In the midst of her surveillance assignment Susan finds herself forced to improvise a more assertive role as a bodyguard hired by Raynas late father to protect the crime princess. That calls for a more glamorous outfit and a lot more action allowing McCarthy to display her slapstick talents in some seriously hair-raising fight scenes (enhanced by clever editing). McCarthy also has a chance to unleash her arsenal of uproariously rude machine-gun insults and threats. While all of these set-piece rants are unprintable one memorably involves a threat of her two fists - named ""Cagney and Lacey"" - entering different orifices and playing someones heart ""like an accordion.""Eventually though Spy becomes to feel like too much of a good thing. The movie runs long conforming more to the two-hour running time of a spy movie rather than a comedy though its an understandable fault. Feigs mission in his third female-centric film after Bridesmaids and The Heat is to do a full feminist (one f-word that doesnt pop up in the script) revision of the macho semi-tragic fantasies of the Bond genre the tailored assassin-heroes their tax-supported luxury lifestyles and svelte disposable sex partners. While the script is the opposite of sanctimonious the gender politics are unambiguous.With Spy Feig McCarthy and a strong ensemble cast have staked out the territory for what could be the kickoff to a major franchise to rival Mike Myers Austin Powers comedies or Peter Sellers The Pink Panther series if the movie world needs any more franchises. In the meantime Spy only whets appetites for Feig and McCarthys next collaboration the female reboot of Ghostbusters with McCarthy Kristen Wiig and Saturday Night Lives Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon.

Close Join the conversation... With Wire Services Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Ridiculous questions about the funniness and bankability of women have clouded exactly whats going on here Nobody is a better comedic actor right now than Melissa McCarthy.Shes a combustible ball of comic fury rolled up in Chaplinesque sweetness equally capable of profanity-laced verbal virtuosity as perfectly timed pratfalls. In her latest the espionage comedy ""Spy"" McCarthy dons a host of identities a closet full of wigs and - in order to stay undercover but really just to switch things up - essentially changes her entire performance midway through.Its a globe-trotting tour of McCarthys talent throughout which shes practically always kicking butt. Who was that double-O-whats-his-face anyway? In an undercover mood after seeing Spy? Here are our top 10 espionage films ""Spy"" is the third collaboration between McCarthy and director Paul Feig who first came together on ""Bridesmaids"" and followed that up with the very solid buddy comedy ""The Heat"" with Sandra Bullock. Theyre soon to embark on a female-led update of ""Ghostbusters"" too which is fitting because their partnership is beginning to resemble that of Bill Murray and Ivan Reitman.Everything theyve done starting with the sensation of ""Bridesmaids"" has been surrounded with both justified praise and tiresome overemphasis on the female-ness of their enterprise. ""Spy"" too is in many ways a great inversion of the Bond world casting men like Jude Law as the eye candy on the side while the center of the movie is played out between women McCarthy and Rose Byrnes snobbish high-couture villain.McCarthy plays Susan Cooper a contentedly desk-bound CIA operative accustom to aiding far more elegant and suave field agents like the tuxedo-clad Bradley Fine (Law a one-time Bond candidate enjoying the brief fantasy of virtually playing the super spy). While Fine pursues supervillains at a Bulgaria casino shes whispering in his earpiece monitoring above from a drone and swooning over his out-of-reach glamour. Melissa McCarthy in ""Spy."" Larry Horricks/20th Century Fox Cooper though is far away in a Langley headquarters cubical where the immediate concerns are more humdrum mouse droppings and birthday cakes. Feig lingers perhaps a tad too long in the films first section but its to a purpose ""Spy"" is in many ways a workplace comedy about the indignities a capable women must suffer in a male-dominated profession.When well-to-do arms dealer Rayna Boyanov (Byrne) outs all of the CIAs field agents Cooper volunteers to go undercover. But the big promotion isnt all she dreamed of When prepared for her covert gig shes handed no poison-firing Rolex or a souped-up Porsche but gadgets hidden in fungal spray and hemorrhoid wipes. Her fake identity isnt much more exotic Carole Jenkins mother of four.Once in Europe Cooper outfitted as a tourist is completely out of place in the ""Casino Royale""-like realm of elite espionage. Its a world that surely doubles for superficial Hollywood where those who resemble McCarthy are seldom let under the velvet rope.At one high-priced dinner she blurts an order of wine ""with the grit of a hummus."" An agent shadowing her Richard Ford (Jason Statham) resents her intrusion while another the absurdly passionate Italian agent Aldo (Peter Serafinowicz) continually gropes her.Statham nearly steals the film by playing a parody of his own grave gonzo persona popping up occasionally to attempt wildly unsuccessful feats of action stardom. The cast generally is likable rounded out with British comedian Miranda Hart as a fellow desk agent and Bobby Cannavale as a terrorist trying to acquire a nuke.Cooper it turns out is surprisingly gifted in combat (the jokes thankfully arent about her bumbling inadequacy) and she steadily thrives by capitalizing on the underestimations of others. Particularly good is the interplay between McCarthy and Byrne who deliciously oozes disgust at McCarthys unrefined Cooper.""Spy"" is the biggest budget for Feig and the action sequences are unexpectedly robust - perhaps too much. While entirely enjoyable it ought to be a tad funnier; the set pieces clunk it up at times. Its almost as if Feig is actually gunning for Bond territory.

A mixed victory. 89 Shares Share 76 Tweet 7 Share 6 Share Email Print Share Melissa McCarthy in Spy. Photo Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox Gazing in awe at Melissa McCarthy on the posters for Spy I thought back to the 90s when Hugh Grant made his name in Four Weddings and a Funeral as an adorably abashed romantic lead and a showbiz paper reported that the question on the lips of every studio executive was Can Hugh Grant hold a gun? Today the question is even more urgent given that a much higher percentage of Hollywoods income is from markets (especially Asian) that want more weaponry more explosions and more recognizable stars. So the last person -- in light of Hollywoods prejudices vis-a-vis women and their body sizes -- youd imagine on a poster holding a big gun is now headlining a potentially lucrative action-comedy ""franchise."" Id like to say the film is a feminist breakthrough but this is all about box office. And its going to be boffo. The central joke ofA SpyA is that this heavy female insult comedian is playing the role of a James Bond undercover secret agent. Well she is and she isnt. Her mousy CIA analyst Susan Cooper steps into the breach when the covers of other agents are blown and shes the only one the villains cant identify on sight. But theres a female-disempowerment backstory too. Ten years earlier Susan had the potential to be a star agent but was seduced by the 007-like smoothie (Jude Law) whom she plainly adored into becoming his personal analyst -- the person who like Chloe onA 24 directs him through an earpiece when hes on assignment. She knew it was unlikely hed be interested in wooing a woman like her but a lonely girl can dream right? And she still has to fight the perception of herself as insignificant. Her superiors give her ostentatiously frumpy disguises and conceal her gizmo-weapons in boxes of hemorrhoid pads. Shes ordered to observe and not to act. So we wait for McCarthy to drop the mousiness and become the mouthy foulmouthed motormouth that made her famous. Action-comedies are generally mixed bags lurching between slapstick and violence andA SpyA is unusually mixed. A page of my notebook reads ""Thats funny ... Ugh .... Thats really funny ... That doesnt work ... They should have cut that its embarrassing ..."" The beginning is the worst part because McCarthy doesnt do meekness well and shes required to stammer stupidly while gazing into Laws baby blues. In several scenes shes paired with another overlooked female analyst played by Miranda Hart a tall flamboyantly gawky British comedian beloved on the other side of the pond. Im sureA SpyA will win her a new audience but the way the movie hard-sells her funniness made me cringe and she and McCarthy never really find a rhythm. As a macho braggart agent who turns out to be a stumblebum Jason Statham is even more off-key. A drolly understated presence in his own action movies -- his Cockney simmer is a thing of beauty -- he signals so broadly that hes doing comedy he kills the jokes. Things improve exponentially with the arrival of Rose Byrne as the villainess Rayna daughter and heir of a recently deceased Eastern-European arms kingpin. Byrne seems to be able to do anything and in comedy terms her Rayna is a career best. The key is breezy understatement. Her Rayna is the ultimate mean girl but her put-downs are so light and insouciant that she just seems to exhale them as if she knows she has more beauty style and smarts than anyone alive and hardly needs to force the issue. The other performer who steals every scene from McCarthy is British TVs best-kept secret Peter Serafinowicz as an Italian agent who takes every opportunity to grab Susans ass and vows to make wild love to her. Serafinowiczs diction is in the strange overdeliberate style of Christopher Walken; he makes even his bad lines hit you like wobbly sinkerballs. (Its worth investing in a PAL/Region 2 DVD player to savorA The Peter Serafinowicz Show.) SpyA reunites McCarthy withA BridesmaidsA andA The HeatA director Paul Feig who once moved the boundary posts on TV withA Freaks and GeeksA but appears to have settled into a conventional Hollywood groove. Apart from a shockingly gory fight scene in a restaurant kitchen between McCarthy and a female assassin he shows no gift for action; and much of the editing in the comedy scenes is pushy as if the editor didnt trust the laughs to come on their own. But the movie jumps to another level once McCarthy is McCarthy again -- i.e. the pop-top fount of abuse. (It makes no psychological sense for the character but if its funny who cares?) And Feig keeps throwing so much stuff at you -- gross-out gags chases brutal violence not to mention actors working their heads off -- that he finally wears down your resistance. In the end I admired him for keeping this ramshackle construction together casting performers I adore and proving that Melissa McCarthy can indeed hold a gun. A mixed victory. A definitively mixed review. Tagsmovie reviewpaul feigrose byrnemelissa mccarthymoviesspyMore Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories What Do the Women of Cleveland Want From Melania Trump?

Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) and her fellow CIA operative Rick Ford (Jason Statham) in Paul Fiegs Spy. Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox Do we really need yet another spy movie send-up? Thats a good question no matter what year it is but 2015 has already brought us Kingsman The Secret Service and Barely Lethal with The Man From U.N.C.L.E. on the way -- not to mention new installments of the real-deal James Bond and Mission Impossible franchises. Whats more Paul Feigs new comedy Spy seems to be taunting us with that terrible title a blah opener that projects its rug-pulling moment from the first frame and the hacky promotional image of Melissa McCarthy posing undercover as a gun-totin cat lady. Its a secret agent spoof that seems like its begging to be thrown out with Johnny Englishs bathwater. The surprise then is that Spy is actually quite funny. It even proves itself to be in the same league with the first two films in Feigs loose comic trilogy Bridesmaids and The Heat; not quite as laugh-filled as the latter but more tightly paced than either and with a better supporting cast. McCarthy who stole Bridesmaids out from under Kristen Wiig and was elevated to equal-partner status with Sandra Bullock on The Heat finally ascends to a solo lead role here and she can take much of the credit for the films success. She gives a warm winning portrayal of Susan Cooper a CIA analyst who once exhibited promise in training but now sits in a vermin-infested basement office coaching the super-suave Bondian agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law) as he infiltrates cocktail parties in the field. When Bradley falls off the grid during a mission the CIA learns that their latest adversary a haughty beehive-doed arms dealer named Rayna (Rose Byrne) knows the identity of all their field agents. This is Susans chance to shine As an untested unknown shes the perfect candidate for a fact-finding mission to Paris. But having watched her employer outfit her male counterparts with the hippest gear and sexiest secret identities for years shes in for a rude awakening when the CIA plops her in a decrepit hotel straight out of Barton Fink as a divorced mother with lumpy tourist outfits laxatives in her purse and a Beaches watch. ""How much am I supposed to like Beaches?"" she asks the bored gadgeteer. ""A lot Id imagine if you have the watch"" he says shrugging. For the past few years McCarthy has been walking a fine line between unique personality types and stock overweight-sidekick gags. Her role as Susan demonstrates her gift at crafting a charming yet incredibly salty screen presence even when the joke isnt on her. In fact it may be on her casting agents Susans struggle to escape her unflattering assigned secret identities is the story of an experienced competent professional woman fighting the roles her superiors expect her to play. Meanwhile the men she works with all fail her in different ways. Bradley uses Susans lingering crush on him to walk all over her in the workplace; a valuable Italian ally (Peter Serafinowicz) leers at her nonstop; and snarling rogue agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) convinced Susan is going to botch the mission keeps finding inventive new ways to botch it himself. Statham brilliantly mocking his usual alpha-dog demeanor has never been better he rattles off improbable boasts of past exploits even as he shows off Clouseau-like incompetence. The film makes clear that Rick and likely the other field agents as well are still alive only because invisible desk workers like Susan keep bailing them out of self-created jams. Byrne too is a highlight riffing on a variation of the cloistered high-society queen she played in Bridesmaids. She and McCarthy have several satisfying scenes where they lob outrageous insults at each other. The film is stuffed with other great ringers like Miranda Hart from PBSs Call The Midwife and Allison Janney so its easy to forgive the stagnant action scenes and tired Bond riffs (ooh an opening-credits pop ballad how original). In 2013 Linda Holmes (my editor ahem) noted ""About 95 percent of The Heat could be made and would still be considered comedy if both of the protagonists were (1) men and (2) thin."" Whats brilliant about Spy is that precisely the opposite is true. It matters that the star is a heavyset woman. The comedy is built not around easy jokes about her weight or gender but around the ways she must fight to be treated fairly in a line of work that favors thin men spying or Hollywood take your pick. When Rick scoffs at the notion that Susan could seduce a male target she wonders why thats so hard to believe. As sad as it is to say sneaking an exchange like that into a big studio comedy might be the most impressive spy maneuver of all.

Photo Credit AP / Larry Horricks advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A deskbound CIA agent gets her big chance to go undercover. Rated R (adult humor and language). BOTTOM LINE A breezy enjoyable comedy and an ideal vehicle for the endearing McCarthy. CAST Melissa McCarthy Jason Statham Rose Byrne Jude Law LENGTH 159 The Central Intelligence Agency hasnt seemed very funny lately probably a lingering effect from all that waterboarding. ""Spy"" starring Melissa McCarthy as an undervalued CIA staffer who finally gets her chance to shine almost makes you forget about the agencys ugly side. This harmless action comedy is about as edgy as ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and almost as enjoyable thanks to its endearing star. McCarthy plays Susan Cooper a deskbound assistant to other more glamorous CIA agents. Equipped with the usual nifty technology Susan serves as the eyes and ears of Bradley Fine (Jude Law) a rogue in the Roger Moore mold who obeys Susans commands while karate-chopping his way to glory. One of the films running jokes is that for Susan Langley is just another crummy workplace with dull gray cubicles and an exasperating mouse problem. advertisement | advertise on newsday When Fine is taken out by the gorgeous supervillain Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) Susan volunteers to go undercover and track her down in Paris. Sadly Susan wont get to pose as an heiress or a jet-setter; shes always the badly dressed tourist or the crazy cat lady. When Susan and Rayna finally meet the salty McCarthy and the icy-cool Byrne (together again after ""Bridesmaids"") have fun playing to their respective types. A more topically minded director like Adam McKay (""The Other Guys"" ""Anchorman 2"") might have sliced more deeply into this material but writer-director Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids"" ""The Heat"") goes for a breezy devil-may-care vibe. That isnt a bad thing and it isnt as easy as it looks. One of Feigs strengths is making the most of his entire cast which he does with Allison Janney as Susans humorless boss Bobby Cannavale as an underworld kingpin and British newcomer Miranda Hart as a nerdy CIA analyst all in fine form. One big surprise is action star Jason Statham spoofing himself as Rick Ford an impossibly macho CIA agent with an inexplicable loathing for Susan. Statham plays the role just this side of deadpan and hes terrific. His funniest lines are unprintable as are McCarthys comebacks. MoviesBig movies out this summer ""Spy"" is an ideal vehicle for McCarthy who gets to show off her best sides -- crass volatile tender -- and even engages in an impressive knife-and-frying-pan battle with an athletic foe. If a lovable underdog like McCarthys Susan works for the CIA maybe the agency isnt all bad.

"Review Spy another team triumph - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Spy another team triumphBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 06/03/2015 090000 PM PDTUpdated 06/04/2015 124501 PM PDTMelissa McCarthy might be a box-office champ but not all her films are knockouts.In the ""win"" category belong the hilariously raunchy ""Bridesmaids"" and the female cop-buddy sendup ""The Heat."" But there are the losers as well the rigorously stupid ""Identity Thief"" and last summers unfocused ""Tammy"" -- one of her rare financial flops.Fortunately in her latest comedy ""Spy"" the funnywoman adored on screen for her zany rants reteams with her ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Heat"" writer/director Paul Feig. And their third collaboration is one of her best a guaranteed blues-chaser. (L-R) Rose Byrne as Raina Boyanov and Melissa McCarthy as Susan Cooper in Spies. (Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox) ( Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century ) The spy caper clicks where other McCarthy vehicles clanked because it gives her a well-drawn role that plays to her strengths as both a comedian and a character actress. But ""Spy"" is more than a souped-up star vehicle. Its an inspired team effort where all elements gel a game cast a sharp director and a substantive screenplay with a feminist kick and surprises aplenty.We know were in good hands in its engaging first moments as we see the overlooked and underappreciated CIA worker Susan Cooper being toyed around with by dapper spy Bradley Fine (Jude Law perfectly cast). Susan is a hyper-efficient employee the brains behind the Bond-like Fine. Her wits help the undercover operative maneuver out of dangerous situations but its always from the sad vantage point of a desk thats stuck in the bowels of a rat- and bat-infested CIA basement. Susan works hard and harbors a not-so-secret longing for Fine (and after seeing Law duded up in a tux who wouldnt?). He adores her but he treats her as if shes simply his personal assistant.Advertisement The storyline kicks into gear when one of Fines assignments goes awry and a nuclear bomb slips into the manicured but deadly hands of Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne of ""Bridesmaids"") the conniving daughter of a slain arms dealer. This sets up a mission impossible to get back the weapon of mass destruction before it does some massive destruction. And thats no small task since some of the best spies might have had their covers compromised due to recent events. Lacking a better option Susans tough boss Elaine (Allison Janney) warms up to Susans preposterous notion that shes the person to go undercover.Its an option that doesnt sit well with cocky and short-fused spy Rick Ford (Jason Statham). Against orders he globetrots right behind Susan who gets saddled with anything-but-suave identities including a cat lady persona complete with a dreadful sweater.Once Susan taps into her inner badass ""Spy"" takes off and earns its R rating with bursts of graphic violence and bad language both played brilliantly for laughs.McCarthys shining moments are when shes doing what she does best which is to improvise or at least thats how it seems off others in the cast. While she and Byrne generate ""Spys"" greatest laughs as they tangle it is the inspired comic union she has with muscled action star Statham that is an outright gas. Statham shows an unexpected ease with comedy and hes a scene-stealer as a deluded macho-man who is more talk than action. Melissa McCarthy as Susan Cooper in Spies.

Feig draws out McCarthys best and shes up to the challenge whether its expressing tenderness and anger or slapsticking her way through the physical humor. Theirs is a partnership of mutual trust and respect and the result is a spirited mind-boosting comedy.Its also a part of a welcome trend this summer season more Hollywood productions with commanding female roles.""Hot Pursuit"" with Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara started this off rather dubiously; since then weve seen standout female roles in box-office Hollywood winners including ""Mad Max Fury Road"" ""Pitch Perfect 2"" and now ""Spy."" Judd Apatows ""Trainwreck"" with Amy Schumer (opening July 17) looks poised to join this pack. Its a development thats been a long time coming; lets hope it quickly goes from seasons surprise to Hollywood habit.spy    Rating R (language throughout violence and some sexual content including brief graphic nudity)Cast Pictured from left Jude Law Rose Byrne Jason Statham and Melissa McCarthy below Director and writer Paul FeigRunning time 2 hoursMcCARTHY IN ACTIONThe domestic gross of films that Melissa McCarthy has appeared in since Bridesmaids in 2011Spy (Starts today)St. Vincent (2014) 44.1 millionTammy (2014) 84.5 millionThe Heat (2013) 159.6 millionThe Hangover Part III (2013) 254.5 millionIdentity Thief (2013) 134.5 millionThis Is 40 (2012) 67.5 millionBridesmaids (2011) 169.1 millionSource www.the-numbers.comPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Spy is an agent of fun for Melissa McCarthy - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Spy is an agent of fun for Melissa McCarthy Spy Movie review by Mark Olsen Mark Olsen reviews Spy starring Melissa McCarthy Rose Byrne Jude Law Jason Statham and Miranda Hart. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Mark Olsen reviews Spy starring Melissa McCarthy Rose Byrne Jude Law Jason Statham and Miranda Hart. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Mark OlsenContact Reporter Spy is fun without being oppressive mean or totally mindless For a few years now summer movies have been tinged by such darkness and destruction that when a movie as adamantly breezy as ""Spy"" comes along it feels not just refreshing but like a rebuke. Movies can be fun too it wants to remind audiences without being oppressive mean or totally mindless.The movie also continues the midcareer blossoming for Melissa McCarthy who once might have been destined for a lifetime of supporting parts but has stepped into lead roles after her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Bridesmaids"" and the success of the TV sitcom ""Mike and Molly."" Written and directed by Paul Feig who worked with McCarthy on ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat"" the new film is also remarkable for the way it doesnt build anyone up by taking someone else down. With a warm and open-hearted way about it even the villains in ""Spy"" are adorable.INDIE FOCUS Sign up for Mark Olsens newsletter about film McCarthy plays Susan Cooper a CIA analyst who sits at a bank of computers in a basement office -- with a vermin problem that provides a surprisingly effective running joke -- where she oversees missions for debonair agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). Fine is taken out while pursuing the daughter of a deceased Eastern European arms dealer who is now brokering the sale of a stolen nuclear bomb. Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) also reveals she has a list of other known operatives which forces agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) underground and Susan is sent into the field for the first time. Melissa McCarthy comedy Michelle Darnell slated for 2016 Oliver Gettell Wife-and-husband comedic duo Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcones next big-screen collaboration is set to arrive in 2016.

Wife-and-husband comedic duo Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcones next big-screen collaboration is set to arrive in 2016. Universal has scheduled ""Michelle Darnell"" which will star McCarthy and be directed by Falcone for release April 8 2016 the studio announced Monday. McCarthy is to play an... (Oliver Gettell) As the action sends her across Europe throughout the movie other people are constantly making assumptions about Susan Cooper largely based on the way she looks. Repeatedly people just figure she must have a lot of cats being a single woman of a certain age and certain shape and the sad frumpy tourist cover identities and costumes she is given by her superior (a dry Allison Janney) feel like one small dig after another.So when Susan emerges glammed-up for an evening undercover at a swank casino -- and with McCarthy looking great -- there is suddenly something downright radical and expressive added to the tired idea of the makeover. Susan is finally being allowed to show the version of herself that has always existed within her but has never been allowed to flourish. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Feig is at his best handling those kind of grace notes just as in ""Bridesmaids"" he would sometimes pause the action for a relaxed conversational scene between Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph or allow nuance for Byrnes perfectionist second wife. In ""Spy"" a similar dynamic emerges in scenes with McCarthy and Byrne or McCarthy and the British comedian Miranda Hart another desk-bound agent sent into the field as backup. Its the relationship between McCarthy and Byrne that gives the film its comedic spine and true soul as they approach each other warily never quite sure of the others true intentions. Watching the actresses together as their characters establish a begrudging mutual respect and something like friendship such as in a sequence on a private jet that skillfully slides from talking to fighting is a thing of pure joy.Statham turns both the movie and his own tough-guy persona upside down every time he comes onscreen. His rants extolling his own accomplishments as an agent are marvels for their lunatic intensity. It will be interesting to see if there is any residual shine from this role for him down the line whether it will become slightly more difficult for audiences to accept his action roles without a chuckle.Amid Byrnes haughty disdain animal prints and piled-high hair Stathams too-much-ness and Harts low-key delivery McCarthy is sometimes relegated to being the straight one in her own starring vehicle. But she makes it work by the subtle emotional shading she brings to the role.Susan is not an Inspector Clouseau-style bungler because any mistakes she makes are ones of inexperience not incompetence. When she wins a fight or otherwise advances her mission there is an impulse to cheer not just for the plot advancement but for character for her.The film isnt a full-on spoof of spy movies in the way of the ""Austin Powers"" pictures or the many other riffs on James Bond. It isnt all that invested in its espionage plot or action mechanics beyond motivation to bring this odd assortment of characters together and keep them moving from one swank-looking locale to the next. As it all falls into place for the finale it should probably feel more amplified than it does -- its a missing nuclear device after all -- but Feigs expert modulation of the comedy and the obvious delight of his crack cast manage to skate right past such concerns.""Spy"" may not be a great movie but it is great fun. And at times it will have you wondering if theres that much of a difference.mark.olsenlatimes.comFollow me on Twitter at IndieFocus and subscribe to my film newsletter------------SpyMPAA Rating R for language throughout violence and some sexual content including brief graphic nudity.Running time 1 hour 55 minutesPlaying In wide release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Movies Entertainment Melissa McCarthy Jason Statham Allison Janney Jude Law Heavens Knows What star knows all about the street life film depicts Movie version of Entourage is Hollywood for Dummies Cameron Crowes Aloha has its charms despite some of its baggage Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-spy-review-20150605-story.html#navtype=outfit,200,spy19,spy,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Comedies based on funny people in peril have been movie gold since the age of Charlie Chaplin. ""Spy"" proves that classic idea never ages out of style even when its about throwing stilettos rather than custard pies. This engaging secret agent farce puts the dead in deadpan. Its as if writer/director Paul Feig studied an Ian Fleming list of everything youre not supposed to do in a spy yarn then did it all -- thereby producing an excellent adventure movie so funny you can barely catch your breath between scenes. Melissa McCarthy (whose best work has been in Feigs rom com ""Bridesmaids"" and cop comedy ""The Heat"") plays CIA office drone Susan Cooper. Her most exciting assignments are watching the agencys top agent through X-ray cameras and sending earphone warnings about approaching danger. Bradley Fine (Jude Law radiating vain chutzpah) gets all the glory impeccable wardrobes and romance including Susans unreturned affection. Bradley like every executive in the organization views wallflower Susan as a lightweight assistant hardly worth a second glance. She sees that as a unique advantage when a key operator is assassinated by Bulgarian weapons dealer Rayna Boyanov (delightfully imperious Rose Byrne flawlessly channeling cartoon villain Natasha Fatale). Susan persuades Langley to excuse her from the mouse- and bat-infested sub-basement office she usually occupies so she can save the day unrecognized. They further conceal her with frumpish frocks horsetail hairdos and weapons camouflaged as nail fungus spray and hemorrhoid wipes. A confidence-building assembly it isnt. But Susans innate abilities rise to the top as shes drawn into bombastic conflict from a wolfish Italian seducer (English actor Peter Serafinowicz deliciously over-the-top) to glorious gory battles. One death duel in a restaurant kitchen shows why skillet rhymes with ""kill it."" McCarthy makes wondrous physical comedy of big action-movie moments. As do her body doubles I assume. If its the star herself leaping midair to catch some stunt guys neck with her thighs ""break a leg"" isnt the right good-luck wish. 20th Century Fox Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) goes undercover in ""Spy."" The film presents her character as one to laugh with rarely at usually about how shes acting almost never how shes looking. Theres a woman-power design driving the story -- even the villain is a woman -- yet it brims with sassy coed laughs. The sexist jokes are largely against guys and done in ways guys find irresistible. The dialogue often veers into extended contests to see who can out-curse each other and the actresses perform their naughty put-ons with Olympic skill. Feig has a powerhouse ensemble here most playing brilliantly against type. Action icon Jason Statham plays overbearing field agent Robert Ford picking childish verbal duels with new arrival Susan. Unless youve had your arm torn off and sewed it back on with the other arm Statham growls move back in with your office vermin. Allison Janney goes entirely humorless as Susans dour boss which makes the character all the funnier. ""Spy"" is a wonderful thriller/comedy/action hybrid moving at a breakneck pace while breaking necks. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox via AP) Larry Horricks This photo provided by Twentieth Century Fox shows Melissa McCarthy as Susan Cooper a CIA analyst who volunteers to go deep undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent a global disaster in a scene from the film ""Spy."" (Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox via AP) If the directors name were Alan Smithee and not Paul Feig no one would mistake ""Spy"" for anything other than a formulaic fiasco. But because Feig directed the estimable ""Bridesmaids"" hes been given enough rope to hang himself. Maybe his apologists will say hes trying to prove that theres room for stupid slapstick in the same tent as character-driven comedy. Maybe this is a meta-movie spoofing cliches about loose nukes and government surveillance. And maybe star Melissa McCarthy is not the same one-note buffoon who inflicted ""Tammy"" on the public but rather the heir to Lucille Ball.Sure and maybe bats will fly out of the ceiling of the CIA. Actually thats one of the few interesting things that happens in ""Spy"" a cookie-cutter caper comedy thats as dumb as the ""Get Smart"" movie.McCarthy plays Susan Cooper a mousy functionary in an underground facility where she radios instructions to suave secret agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). When Fines cover is blown the only agent who understands the details about a black-market bomb is the untested Cooper. Over the objections of macho operative Rick Ford (Jason Statham) Cooper is dispatched to a series of European capitals to track down glamorous arms dealer Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne amusingly bitchy). Its a running gag that Coopers various secret identities are frumpy spinsters yet thats essentially what Cooper already is. Is it supposed to be a hilarious twist when an overweight clumsy woman adds a wig and an ""I Love Cats"" T-shirt to her wardrobe? Granted McCarthy is a funny woman with an inventive mind and a physical grace that belies her heft. Shes a not-so-secret weapon waiting to be utilized. But Feigs script is so underwritten that none of the comedy grows organically out of her character or the plot. When Cooper tracks Boyanov to Rome and infiltrates her gang the mouse becomes a lioness with kung-fu fury and a foul mouth. Coopers torrent of tough-gal obscenities is a hoot but where was this fierce alter-ego when she couldnt commandeer a scooter without toppling over and saying ""shucks""?Movies have been spoofing secret agents since the Bond-era ""Our Man Flint"" and the parody genre peaked with the ""Austin Powers"" movies a generation ago. With the overlong limp and lazy ""Spy"" Feig has lost his mojo.

Writer and director Paul Feig gives McCarthy a film worthy of her talents.Melissa McCarthy finally has a lead role worthy of her talents in ""Spy.""(Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 stars (out of 5)McCarthy gets to use her improvisational skills with genius-level insult humor.Byrne has emerged as a comic force.Its about time.Finally after the promise shown in ""Bridesmaids"" but sold short since by weak scripts in films like ""Tammy"" and ""Identity Thief"" Melissa McCarthy gets a movie vehicle worthy of her talents. ""Spy"" is hilarious and heartfelt a terrific movie written and directed by Paul Feig (who also directed ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat"") that allows McCarthy and a terrific cast to shine.Its a sort of spoof of James Bond-type spy movies but not entirely. Feig takes the cloak-and-dagger elements just seriously enough to give them impact then plops them down in a gleefully R-rated obscenity-laced world for which McCarthy and co-star Rose Byrne -- who has emerged an unlikely comic force -- were born to thrive in.Qamp;A Director Paul Feig talks about directing womenSusan Cooper (McCarthy) is a CIA analyst who works in the vermin-infested bowels of the Langley Va. headquarters. Shes trained as an agent but has settled into a comfortably frumpy existence as the eyes and ears of smooth-as-silk agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law) who is to Susan fine indeed. With her help monitoring Fine on her computer and talking into his earpiece Fine is a super agent able to dispatch bad guys and get past danger.Hes also flirty but ultimately frustrating for Susan who wishes he saw her as more than a friend -- and a friend who does his laundry at that.On the bad-guy front a rich beautiful and ruthless Bulgarian arms dealer named Rayna Boyanov (Byrne) commits a game-changing act and lets the CIA know that she has the identity of every agent and will kill anyone who tries to prevent her from selling a nuclear device to the evil Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale).Susan hits on an idea She has never worked in the field so why doesnt she go after Rayna? Her boss goes along with the idea though hardly enthusiastically -- and over the hilarious objections of ridiculously tough spy Richard Ford (Jason Statham having a ball poking fun at his usual type of role).Rose Byrne (left) is the villain to Melissa McCarthys CIA agent in ""Spy."" (Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Its a limited mission Susan disguised as an impossibly dowdy loser -- and armed with weaponized hemorrhoid wipes stool softeners etc. -- is simply to observe and report on Raynas movements. Of course this lasts about five minutes before Susan is thrown into action with the help of her own version of herself Nancy Artingstall (Miranda Hart) a similarly frumpy co-worker who mans the computer and monitors Susan as she chases after Rayna.Related 5 fun film events around time this weekOnce Susan reaches Rayna and convinces her that she is in fact a private bodyguard hired by Raynas father a funny movie gets funnier. McCarthy and Feig take the gloves off and McCarthy dives headlong into some of the best insult humor puncturing the spoiled Raynas arrogance that youll ever see. If you saw the post-credit outtakes of ""This is 40"" where McCarthy ad libbed insults directed at Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann (trying not to break and failing) youll be delighted at this turn in the story.It sounds like a lot of plot for a movie that really doesnt have that much; its more than just something to hang jokes on but not a lot more. And thats perfectly fine. Feig wisely depends on McCarthy as the center of the story and she shines. Everyone in the movie is outstanding committed to the comedy but to the story as well. But it rises or falls with McCarthys performance and she makes Susan not only hilarious but heartfelt. All Susan needed was a chance.AZCENTRALSpy (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsMuch like McCarthy.Feig obviously knows how to play to McCarthys strengths giving her the freedom to draw on her improvisational skills and surrounding her with a great cast and a funny story. Together they stare down the women-in-Hollywood stereotypes -- an actress has to be Size 0 model-beautiful blah blah blah -- and smash through them laughing the whole time.As will you during ""Spy"" the funniest movie of the summer (so far).Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

At GTA theatres. 115 minutes. 14AMelissa McCarthys wicked take on the 007 persona in Paul Feigs subversive Spy is a joy to watch -- and also something of a relief.She commands the screen in a role both comic and dramatic a welcome change from the single-note tedium of most of her assignments since her Oscar-nominated breakout with Bridesmaids.Article Continued BelowJust a year ago with the dismal Tammy reeking of typecasting it seemed McCarthy had slammed into a brick wall with her down-market disturber schtick. Could there be no better use of her considerable talent than endless variations of loud and obnoxious?Melissa McCarthy takes on the spy thriller from a womans point of view.  (Larry Horricks)  Partial answer came last fall with St. Vincent as McCarthy cagily played straight woman to Bill Murrays title loon.Spy confirms that her star still rises and deservedly so. Reuniting with her Bridesmaids and The Heat director Feig who also wrote the screenplay McCarthy gives free rein to every aspect of her personality. The film is similarly versatile one part parody one part thriller one part lethal satire of movie sexism.McCarthy is Susan Cooper a brainy but timid CIA analyst who troubleshoots for brash field agent Bradley Fine played by a game Jude Law with a knowing wink from the James Bond playbook.The desk-chained and devoted Cooper watches via hidden satellite cams and whispers danger alerts to Fine via an earpiece content to let him take all the glory. Her close friend Nancy (the delightfully deadpan Miranda Hart) drones away nearby on equally important but unsung tasks in their dingy basement office infested with mice and bats.A mission to wrest an atomic bomb from a Bulgarian arms dealers twitchy palms goes disastrously awry exposing the CIAs top agents. The only thing left to do much to the chagrin of the agencys brass (Allison Janney radiates authority) and benched spies (Jason Statham amusingly plays the most resentful one) is to send in the unknown and untested Cooper.This would ordinarily be as far the script goes with McCarthy doing her familiar wisecracks and pratfalls in a story that dissolves into noisy farce. That side of her is certainly in the film -- the trailer emphasizes it -- but theres more to her character this time than confrontations and cuss words.Turns out shes Cooper Susan Cooper. But to prove it shes going to have to take on not only ruthless terrorist Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) a femme fatale in every sense of the word but also the sexist culture of the CIA.Witness the scene where she gets her spy gadgets where Bond would acquire sleek cars and cool toys Cooper gets sensible wheels and weapons disguised as embarrassing medical aids. Shes better than this even if her snickering male colleagues arent.Spys skewering of macho culture in which McCarthy is ably assisted by Hart Byrne and Janney is the stealth weapon and most satisfying aspect of a film that lacks for only a ruthless editor. Some gags go on too long such as Peter Serafinowiczs bizarre turn as a lecherous Italian agent named Aldo.The movie also works surprisingly well as a thriller right down to the 007-style theme music opening credits and credible global threat. The laddish antics of Austin Powers Johnny English and the original Casino Royale seem downright juvenile by comparison.

A shlumpy CIA agent is given a dangerous assignment. Director Paul Feig (155). R Language comic violence. Area theaters. The intel is in Melissa McCarthy can carry a comedy. Specifically ""Spy."" That should be a balm to people who sat through last years bomb ""Tammy."" She even helps ""Spy"" leap over many of the hurdles of a genre -- the secret-agent spoof -- that was tired more than 30 years ago. Yet as long as there are adventure thrillers there will be adventure-thriller parodies. The moments when ""Spy"" falls apart are when the film fancies itself the real thing. The times when it works are due to its leading lady. McCarthy plays Susan Cooper a CIA desk jockey working with suave field agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). Shes the voice in his earpiece the eye in the sky. When Fine is apparently killed in the field their boss (wry Allison Janney) is convinced that they need an unknown agent to gather crucial info. So Cooper goes to Rome and Bulgaria undercover. Shes hunting the slithery Raina (Rose Byrne) whos trying to sell a nuclear weapon to a smooth baddie named De Luca (Bobby Cannavale wasted in a small role). Cooper has some help. One aid is Rick Ford (Jason Statham) a wild-card screw-loose rogue agent. The other is her pal Nancy (Miranda Hart) the only person at CIA headquarters more inept than Susan. ""Spy"" is directed by Paul Feig whose ""Bridesmaids"" earned McCarthy a Best Supporting Actress nod. She also was great as a heathen cop in Feigs ""The Heat"" and is about to do his female ""Ghostbusters."" Here McCarthys fish-out-of-water talent is the spine of the humor -- so when it clicks its because McCarthy is embracing her goofiness and overt physicality. Even straddling a scooter she makes her anti-Milla Jovovich-ness part of the joke. Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham as CIA operatives (Larry Horricks) A face-off with a knife-wielding adversary (Larry Horricks) Watching McCarthy fight a female assassin in an all-out kitchen smackdown using plates and frying pans as weapons is a sight to behold. What feels stale unfortunately the familiar benchmarks that we know from those other James Bondish joke-a-thons. The high-speed chases unloaded guns silly disguises unbelievable helicopter leaps. Feig also makes the mistake of overwriting the story. The plot twists fight for our attention. Thats a bad idea -- and exhausting. The movie moves better when he surrounds McCarthy with funny turns from Statham (who knew?) Byrne Janney and especially British comic Hart. When the square peg McCarthy and the gangly stork-like Hart stand next to each other their Abbot-and-Costello quality is perfect. ""Spy"" cant be called perfect or close to it but the movies better than hit-or-miss. Happily for fans of McCarthy she shoots from her formidable hip -- and she hits the target.

"Paul Feigs Spy starring Melissa McCarthy reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Spy Finally a Movie Gets Melissa McCarthy Right Spy Finally a Movie Gets Melissa McCarthy Right Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 4 2015 1111 AM Spy Paul Feigs latest movie gives Melissa McCarthy her best and realest character since Bridemaids. By Dana Stevens Melissa McCarthy as Susan Cooper in Spy. Photo courtesy Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy have already proven they know how to make beautiful music together. In Feigs Bridesmaids McCarthy made an impression amid a cast of offbeat comediennes in the small but pivotal role of the grooms etiquette-challenged sister. Her character was always uncouth frequently bizarre and sometimes downright gross. Yet she remained essentially and unmistakably a warm and decent person throughout worthy of the audiences love (and the lust of the sweetly pervy air marshal played by McCarthys real-life husband comic Ben Falcone). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But since Bridesmaids not all McCarthys films have found that sweet spot. McCarthys next movie with Feig The Heat a buddy-cop comedy that paired her with Sandra Bullock was less skillful at harnessing that quality of basic goodness that flows from McCarthys screen presence as if from a tap. Oh she had some inspired flights of improvisation as a Boston street cop with anger issues as did Bullock playing a prim federal agent. But The Heat never quite decided who McCarthys character was One minute the audience was being urged to pity her loneliness the next to laugh merrily at her rageful tirades. And the bland Identity Thief an awkward vehicle co-starring Jason Bateman and directed by Seth Gordon presented McCarthy as an outlandish grifter then softened her ragged edges--not to mention subjecting her to a humiliating eleventh-hour makeover. The third McCarthy-Feig collaboration Spy--a raunchy and surprisingly gory parody of James Bond-style espionage adventures--puts McCarthy in the solo starring position for the first time. Though she has many collaborators nemeses and romantic interests--some of whom switch from one status to another as the movie goes on--McCarthys Susan Cooper a CIA paper-pusher-turned-spy is the sole heroine of the movie. Its success rests on not only the skill of her performance--we all know Melissa McCarthy can bring the funny--but on the dramatic integrity of her character. Spy is by no means as good an all-around movie as Bridesmaids but thanks to Feigs adroit screenplay it sometimes reaches that films satisfying wholeness of characterization. Advertisement Susan Cooper is a loyal CIA bureaucrat. Though shes snidely referred to as a ""lunch lady"" by one male colleague Susan is actually a certified agent working a desk job at headquarters as the indispensable in-ear advisor of the suave globe-trotting field agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). Susan has a crush on Bradley that she does a woefully bad job of hiding but he seems oblivious though he clearly values her as a colleague. Propelled by a combination of unrequited love and professional ambition Susan volunteers for a dangerous international mission involving a rogue nuke on the black market. What makes the mission dangerous is the complex network of bad guys facing Susan and Spy offers a multiplicity of juicy comic villains. In addition to Bridesmaids Rose Byrne as the spoiled daughter of a deceased Bulgarian arms dealer theres Bobby Cannavale as an amoral Euro-terrorist and--in the movies most noteworthy supporting performance--Jason Statham as the buffoonish Rick Ford an arrogant fellow agent who quits his job in a huff when Susan is given the plum assignment he coveted. Pretty soon everyones cover is blown as Rick trails Susan from Paris to Rome to Budapest Hungary popping up in various bad disguises to brag of his past spying exploits. (In one extended monologue he describes such macho triumphs as reattaching his own severed arm using only the remaining arm.) Ricks macabre account of his own injury is hilarious but there are a lot of scenes of people getting hurt in Spy that arent so fun. For a lightweight genre pastiche this movie contains a lot of pretty explicit gore fight scenes replete with the sight and sound of bones being wrenched from their sockets; a man impaled on a yardlong piece of reinforcing steel bar; another man who drinks a poison that dissolves the flesh of his throat. Theres also an ongoing subplot featuring Peter Serafinowicz as Aldo an Italian agent obsessed with trying to cop a feel of Susans ample ""bosoms"" or whatever else he can get a handful of even in moments of extreme peril. The Aldo-Susan relationship may feel borderline offensive to some viewers but it didnt bother me and often made me laugh whether because of the Labrador-like guilelessness of Aldos incessant pawing or the weary matter of factness with which Susan rebuffs it. Not to give too much away about who does what with whom but Spy treats sexual intrigue among its characters in an unorthodox way that I really appreciated--theres not just one potential romantic partner for McCarthys character but several offered up at different points in the movie. Also unorthodox in a Hollywood film (though thankfully growing slowly less so) is the warm treatment of female friendship. Susans most important relationship may be with her work buddy Nancy (the wonderful Miranda Hart) a colleague back at CIA headquarters whos now serving as the in-ear advisor for her in the field. By the time the delirious final action sequence arrives (Helicopter chases Briefcases of diamonds Statham in a speedboat) Susan has not only proven wrong the boss (Allison Janney) who once doubted her crime-stopping prowess but also become an object of erotic interest to several other characters in addition to Aldo the horndog. Spy lampoons sexism without abandoning sex--a tough tone for a comedy to strike but one that Feig and McCarthy manage to accomplish with both a sense of justice and a sense of humor. If you see Spy stay through the end credits for two reasons. First of all because theyre delightful credits which plot out a variety of ridiculous future missions and undercover personas for the once-meek now-empowered Susan. And secondly because theres a tiny scene at the very end apparently an outtake that provides a subversive twist hints (subtly for once) at the possibility of a sequel and also shows McCarthy making one of her fellow actors and then herself laugh so hard they break character and ruin the shot. Its endearing to see McCarthys co-star cracking up at the actresss comic brilliance--after all weve just spent two hours doing the same.

(Larry Horricks/AP) By Ann Hornaday June 4 2015 Follow AnnHornaday There are lots of things to like about ""Spy"" and more than a few to love. The James Bond spoof written by ""Bridesmaids"" creator and future ""Ghostbusters"" feminizer Paul Feig begins with a note-perfect homage to the spy series with a brassy belt-y opening number by Ivy Levan and a suave sequence featuring a tuxedo-wearing Jude Law as a cool-as-a-cuke international operative. But when things with the villain get hairy Feig cuts to reveal that Laws character -- a CIA agent named Brad Fine -- is getting help. Back at Langley Susan Cooper is working the angles via remote cameras telling Fine how many bad guys lurk around every corner. Behind every debonair man with a license to kill it seems theres a sensitive focused high-functioning woman. Its a terrific conceit part ""Austin Powers"" part ""Broadcast News."" And as the all-knowing voice inside Laws pretty little head Melissa McCarthy plays Susan with a combination of self-deprecating modesty and I-got-this knowingness. Susan -- who toils away in the agencys vermin-infested basement along with her best friend Nancy (the great British comedienne Miranda Hart) and a slew of other women -- is invisible even to Fine who takes her to a chummy dinner oblivious to the fact that shes in love with him. Shes the kind of person who goes through life being passed over dismissed and underestimated -- when shes taken into account at all. That changes when Susan gets a chance to prove her chops in the field which is when ""Spy"" becomes the antic action comedy we have come to expect from the man who last directed McCarthy (alongside Sandra Bullock) in ""The Heat."" Feig has become the George Cukor for early 21st century female stars but instead of urbane dialogue flattering camera angles and carefully pitched emotion he gives them swagger sexual confidence and an armamentarium of shocking profanities. Feigs movies arent particularly stylish -- the visuals in ""Spy"" are serviceable at best and the makeup is particularly un-subtle -- but they possess a silly sweet streak that makes them irresistibly infectious. When Susan goes mano a mano with her quarry a bedroom-eyed Bulgarian heiress played by an admirably deadpan Rose Byrne the two cook up a fabulous see-saw chemistry with Byrne lobbing witheringly flawless burns and McCarthy hitting every pitch with a satisfying pop to the cheap seats. Equally on point is Jason Statham as an arrogant CIA agent who spends the entire movie recounting his career of improbable Bond-like stunts and telling Susan shes about to foul everything up. This isnt to say that ""Spy"" is perfect -- far from it. There are jokes that dont land and bits that are just lame (and the mice-in-the-CIA bit goes nowhere fast) and its at least 10 to 20 minutes too long. But within the confines of its genre -- commercial unambitious action comedy -- ""Spy"" delivers the physical stunts running gags and stinging one-liners that audiences expect from the form even if Feig depends once too often on simplistic vulgarity to land a joke. The real revelation here is McCarthy who since her breakout performance in ""Bridesmaids"" has been pigeonholed as a girthy slightly gross tomboy. In ""Spy"" she lets the rest of her flags fly first donning a series of risibly dowdy disguises then swanning around in wigs and gowns that turn her into a slinky seductive siren. Her generously proportioned body might once have been the punch line used and abused in the interest of ungainly graceless slapstick. The relief then is palpable when McCarthy seizes the opportunity to be so much more including but not limited to glamorous crafty smart funny brave and surpassingly loyal to her female colleagues. As cinema ""Spy"" is content to cater to its own conventions hit the required marks and earn a few laughs along the way. As a cultural bellwether it does something bigger and more important without ever italicizing that fact. Theres something cosmic or at least karmic about McCarthy going head-to-head this weekend with the dude canoe that is ""Entourage."" That pounding in your head isnt a hangover bruh.

"Spy review Melissa McCarthy goes the full Bond - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Spy review Melissa McCarthy goes the full Bond Spy movie review Handout TNS Melissa McCarthys latest movie ""Spy"" reunites her with ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig for their third collaboration. Melissa McCarthys latest movie ""Spy"" reunites her with ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig for their third collaboration. (Handout TNS) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Cooper. Susan Cooper. Shes a spy. Her movies fun. Last year in the Bill Murray vehicle ""St. Vincent"" Melissa McCarthy did something shed never done before in the movies. She did less.Her role neither a wallflower nor the raunchy life of the party required an easier lower-key brand of comic truth than the material for which shed become rich and famous on TV in ""Mike and Molly"" and in the movies. She came through. Like many highly skilled actors McCarthy is consistently a little better than her material and when the materials strong as in the case of ""Bridesmaids"" shes a ringer. Contrivances such as ""Identity Thief"" not so much. Good news then that McCarthys latest ""Spy"" reunites her with ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig for their third collaboration. (The middle one was ""The Heat"" co-starring Sandra Bullock.) Coming off ""St. Vincent"" McCarthy exhibits a newfound subtlety in the best scenes in ""Spy"" which is a strange thing to say about a film with a full quotient of R-rated trash talk along with a barrage of violence played more or less straight to mixed results. I prefer my comedies a little less bone-crunchy.But the cast led by McCarthy as a behind-the-scenes CIA analyst who finally gets a taste of the James Bond action drives this vehicle with supreme confidence. The laughs are there small bits and large. Feig has made three viable commercial comedies in a row a minor miracle in itself. The fun of ""Spy"" comes in watching the right actors mess with their own images blithely. Susan Cooper (McCarthy) works as the earpiece and remotely connected intel expert for superspy Bradley Fine played by spot-on Jude Law. When Fine runs afoul of Bulgarian arms dealers and disappears presumed dead Cooper gets her chance to enter the field even if her mission is designed as a ""track and report"" not a maim and kill.Where ""Spy"" goes from there to various European capitals played mostly by Budapest is predictable in many ways but fresh in a few others. Jason Statham rolls in as a hilariously belligerent spy seething with resentment regarding Coopers newbie status. Miranda Hart of the BBC-TV series ""Call the Midwife"" plays Coopers best pal and fellow analyst and the rapport between her and McCarthy helps make the movie just as Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolphs friendship made ""Bridesmaids."" Spy (Clip) A short clip from the new film ""Spy"" Gadgets (Screenplay) A short clip from the new film ""Spy"" Gadgets (Screenplay) See more videos Laws consistently funny simply by bringing Bondian smugness (think Pierce Brosnan but smugged up to 11) into fruitful new territory. His character is introduced with an outlandishly effective sight gag involving an ill-timed sneeze. It might be the grandest laugh in the film. As the snooty arms dealers daughter Rose Byrne provides the needed contrast to our heroine; shes a Bond girl whose hair appears to be its own country.The more paranoid and surveillance-prone we become as a culture the more spy movies well see and the more spy comedies well see in response. Feig the director is required by Feig the screenwriter to chase after a wearying amount of plot sometimes entertainingly sometimes less so. But McCarthys latest works. Its a showcase for its star that takes care to spread the jokes around. And it finds straight-faced aces such as Allison Janney (as a CIA director) to show how less can be more.

Illustrates FILM-SPY-ADV05 ... more Photo Handout Washington Post Spy reveals Melissa McCarthys comic gifts at last 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Ever since ""Bridesmaids"" launched her movie career four years ago Melissa McCarthy has not had an easy time in pictures. With the exception of ""The Heat"" in which she co-starred opposite Sandra Bullock McCarthys movies have not only been disappointing but suggested that filmmakers had no idea what to do with her. She has been too sentimental (""Tammy"" ""St. Vincent"") or too harsh (""Identity Thief"") and she has only been funny in small doses as in ""This Is 40."" It had begun to seem as though McCarthy was a natural supporting comic and should not be headlining movies -- but now comes ""Spy"" the first film to make a real case for her as a name-above-the-the-title star. Its an important movie for her and comes not a moment too soon a comic delight that showcases her in a range of modes. Everything anybody likes about Melissa McCarthy is contained in this movie. Engagingly hostile She has subtle moments of comic acting in which she has to react to people with a complexity of emotion. She gets to show her abilities as a straight man suppressing frustration at the clueless people around her. The movie showcases her slapstick ability too her inspired silliness; and it also gives her a chance to be aggressive and verbally abusive. Nobody is better than McCarthy at over-the-top comic hostility. Its no surprise that ""Spy"" was written and directed by someone who knows what McCarthy can do -- Paul Feig who directed her best movies ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat."" ""Spy"" has the feel of something tailored for a specific performer and its a perfect fit. At the start of the movie Susan works for the CIA but in a humble capacity -- in a basement office at Langley thats infested by mice and rats. (The vermin infestation is a zany extra touch recurring throughout the movie and it says something about Feigs willingness to pursue and get a laugh.) Susans job is to read the heat-sensitive map and give her super-spy in the field (Jude Law) moment-by-moment instructions and its very clear as she does that she can barely contain her crush on him. When a terrorist network busts the identities of the CIAs entire staff of field operatives the director has no choice but to turn to someone the terrorists dont already know. And so Susan is sent to Paris to follow and report on the various terrorists activities. She has the usual assortment of secret weapons and gadgets but as her alias is unglamorous the gadgets are disguised as things like hemorrhoid wipes antifungal toe spray and stool softener. A running joke throughout the movie is that the CIA keeps giving her covert identities that make her look like ""someones homophobic aunt."" Well-cast characters Jason Statham who can be very funny but rarely gets the chance plays a blustering rogue agent who cant stop bragging about his exploits -- for example he had his arm blown off but reattached it with his other arm or he jumped from a building using nothing but a raincoat as a parachute -- though its clear that hes a liar and a fumbler. As the amoral daughter of a notorious terrorist Rose Byrne is ideally matched with McCarthy as her opposite in look manner and temperament. ""Spy"" is two hours long a bit of a stretch for a comedy but it doesnt seem long at all and keeps finding ways to renew its energy. It was filmed in Paris and Budapest two highly photogenic cities and they help. If youre just writing a screenplay you might as well set it in any hellhole but if youre both writing and directing Paris and Budapest are inspired choices. Everyone involved seems to have had a good time with ""Spy"" and so will the audience. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy may not make spoofs in the vein of the old Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker dynasty but their developing cinematic partnership has built a playful relationship with well-worn genres. The Heat ran through the buddy-cop formula without exactly satirizing it instead tweaking conventions to accommodate the rare female buddy duo. Spy similarly doesnt exactly send up James Bond or Jason Bourne espionage thrillers but it places McCarthy in the middle of the action while subverting the traditionally male domination of that arena.McCarthy plays Susan Cooper a CIA analyst with as her boss (Allison Janney) puts it a ""certain tame demeanor."" Shes a capable office drone in a field that values the manly slickness of Bradley Fine (Jude Law) her unofficial partner and clear Bond analogue save for his American accent (presumably Laws voice is flattened to balance out a Brit-heavy cast). The movie opens with a sequence that pulls back the curtain on pumped-up spy-craft revealing that behind every suave ass-kicking secret agent is a desk jockey (in this movie usually female) whispering instructions warnings and notes about his allergy medicine into his earpiece. Spys CIA isnt necessarily more realistic than depictions in any other pieces of big-studio escapism but the film cleverly melds the sensibilities of glossy thrillers with a sitcom version of office banality. Fine saves the day and Susan gets little credit while pining for his muscular handsomeness and fighting the assumption that she must own multiple cats.But when a leak compromises the identities of the agencys all-star roster of badasses including Fine and hotheaded bruiser Rick Ford (Jason Statham) Susan nervously volunteers to enter the field and track down a missing nuclear bomb by trailing the nefarious Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne). Soon shes embroiled in a country-hopping costume-changing adventure--one that like The Heat toys with its own dopey genre constraints while managing to treat McCarthys character with some manner of dignity even when the actress continues to demonstrate that shell commit to any bit for a laugh.McCarthy has been accused of playing the same character repeatedly but thats not really the case in her films with Feig. (Even in her lesser leading roles for other filmmakers she doesnt play the same person so much as a consistently erratic sometimes incoherent mix of her various talents slapstick elaborate threats playing dumb.) The unassuming unassertive Susan isnt much like the brusque fighter of The Heat or glorious weirdo she played in Bridesmaids; if anything its Statham who does some McCarthy-style shtick in the early going by spouting off profane tangents about his implausible past feats of strength or fortitude. (And hes a riot kidding his Crank/Expendables persona with bravado). McCarthy cedes him a surprising number of laughs until Susan finds her footing and starts incorporating some familiar aspects of McCarthys past work; when she finally unleashes a vicious insult its like a Will Ferrell character finally indulging in a panicked outburst. But McCarthy plays a variety of notes with more coherence than she did in Tammy; the actress is by turns shy frustrated aggressive and eventually a scrappy action dynamo. She gives an impressively multifaceted performance that somehow avoids leaning on Susans various outlandish disguises for its biggest laughs.Those laughs arent delivered in a nonstop barrage; Feig hews too closely to his genre checkpoints for the movie to explode into Adam McKay-style genius. Feigs directing skills are if anything under-appreciated--Spy has plenty of decent sight gags--but here he sometimes slows down the movie with reactions that repeat or narrate jokes perhaps trying to make sure theyre heard above the busy din of action. Protracted scene-setting and various plot twists help push the movie to the two-hour mark without providing the kind of extended nutty asides that can be a major benefit of the improv-heavy comic style. McCarthy Statham and Byrne all have killer moments--the latter sketches her villain with such acute expressions of withering derision that she can get a laugh with as little as a gesture--but Feigs script too frequently shuffles its many characters in and out of the action. By the final third the plot depends largely on various members of the cast popping up disappearing then popping up again. But if the ensemble doesnt fully gel as such thats because Spy isnt a buddy comedy no matter how well Statham Byrne and others pair with the star. Though Susan isnt as arrogant as her male counterparts shes intended to be as singular a force in her own way as Bond Bourne or Jason Statham and Feig does McCarthy the service of not weighing down the empowerment with extraneous lectures about teamwork or a time-consuming love story. If the movie goes a little easy on the very idea of a righteously ass-kicking CIA its probably because Feig and McCarthy arent at their core satirists. At their best they use genre tropes in service of characters better than those in many actual genre films. Rare is the broad mainstream comedy that can goof on its bigger-budget Hollywood siblings while providing a few moments of sincere uplift.

"Spy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; spy ) Spy (United States 2015) June 04 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Summer is the season of bloat and the trait is evident in Spys excessive running length. At about 90 minutes this would have been a fresh breezy action-comedy. However with an additional half-hour of padding viewers are forced to endure stretches of tedium. Humor like any intense ingredient is best when presented in a concentrated form. By lasting two hours Spy dilutes it past the point of peak effectiveness. The problem is that writer/director Paul Feig became too enamored with his storyline which at best could be described as a lame James Bond parody.  By spending too much time developing the feeble narrative without offering viewers anything surprising or clever he undercuts the elements of Spy that work. I have always found that Melissa McCarthy like Jack Black is best absorbed in small doses.  Her most effective movie performance to-date is Bridesmaids where she had a supporting role. Thrust into the lead of such films as The Heat Identity Thief and Tammy she has worn out her welcome; her characters tend to be more annoying than appealing. Two hours of McCarthy is too much. There are instances when she exhibits a gift for physical comedy but theres no consistency. Her co-stars fare somewhat better although Rose Byrne as the villainous Rayna Boyanov is strangely unfunny and Jude Law is uneven as the 007-inspired Bradley Fine. Jason Statham as Rick Ford is consistently amusing (in limited screen time) as an anger-fueled bumbler from the Inspector Clouseau school of heroism.  (Imagine Statham channeling Sellers.) Miranda Hart is over-the-top but only occasionally obnoxiously so. The film begins with a dash of promise.  The first sequence is a direct satire of Bond openings (sans iris) with dashing superspy Bradley Fine seeking to locate a suitcase nuke while deskbound agent Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) feeds him tactical information through an earpiece. This leads into opening credits that offer homage to the iconic 007 title sequences. Then Spy starts to falter. After the antagonist Rayna removes Fine from the equation and indicates that she recognizes all the other famous agents Susan in pressed into undercover duty because of her anonymity. She pursues Rayna across Europe making contact when circumstances demand it. The belligerent Ford appears from time-to-time to complicate matters but in the end everything depends on Susan to save the day. Spy is irreverent but perhaps not irreverent enough. Some of the best scenes involve Susan adopting the persona of a tough-talking no-nonsense bodyguard but there arent enough of these. Theres also an inventive kitchen fight scene with McCarthy and Nargis Fakhri that displays a Jackie Chan influence in the way that anything and everything becomes a weapon. The ending however is lackluster and with the exception of an amusing gag focused on Statham forgettable. Spy probably would have been more engaging if it wasnt being released too soon in the wake of the superior Kingsman The Secret Service which has a similar agenda. The film also would have been more enjoyable if Feig didnt expend so much time and energy trying to convince us theres a real story here. There isnt. The characters are one-dimensional. The narrative is flat and obvious. The point (as is true of most mass-market comedies) is to make us laugh. It succeeds at that goal but not enough and certainly not with sufficient frequency to justify taking up 120 minutes of the viewers time. This is disposable entertainment best investigated when it makes its way to a home viewing option.

EntertainmentMovies Spy Spoofy fun for summer starring Melissa McCarthy Originally published June 4 2015 at 1205 am Updated June 4 2015 at 140 pm Secret agents Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) and Rick Ford (Jason Statham) go undercover as a ""happy"" couple in ""Spy."" (Photo credit Larry Horricks) A review of Paul Feigs ""Spy"" with Melissa McCarthy Jude Law Miranda Hart and Jason Statham as comic secret agents. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Melissa McCarthys infectious giggle is put to good use in ""Spy"" a cheery if slightly overlong romp from writer/director Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids"" ""The Heat""). As Susan Cooper a brilliant but deskbound CIA agent she lights up like a kid on the first day of summer vacation. ""Am I going?"" she says incredulously upon learning that shes about to be sent out into the field -- Europe no less -- for the first time and she cant contain her giddiness ... even upon learning that her new identity will be well less than glamorous. Her eyes sparkle with excitement upon seeing a table of shiny James Bond-ish gadgets; ""Those arent yours"" shes told briskly and the sparkle fades -- but just a bit. After seeing McCarthys talents wasted in last summers thoroughly unfunny ""Tammy"" its a kick to see her having so much fun here -- and for that matter to see a spy spoof with a woman at its center. Susan gets pulled into an investigation after her in-the-field partner Bobby (a suave Jude Law apparently born to appear in spy spoofs) is apparently murdered at the hands of international woman of intrigue Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne a world-class sneerer) whose villainy is rivaled in vastness only by a coiffure approximately the size of France. (""Lucky your hair broke your fall"" notes Susan when Rayna takes a tumble.) Throw in Susans geeky CIA buddy Nancy (Miranda Hart) and resentful rogue agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) whos quite convinced that the agency has a secret Face/Off machine somewhere that they wont tell him about and youve got a formidable comedy troupe. This is though a star turn for McCarthy and shes both sweet and vulnerable (Susan cherishes a secret crush on Bobby to the point that she hilariously lets it slip that shes named their theoretical children) and a formidable action-movie heroine. Feig though his film isnt perfect (it has a few slow spots and you wish Allison Janney as Susans boss had some funnier lines) is a summer-movie master ""Spy"" plus popcorn feels just right. Movie Review    Spy with Melissa McCarthy Jude Law Jason Statham Rose Byrne Miranda Hart Bobby Cannavale Allison Janney. Written and directed by Paul Feig. 120 minutes.

Melissa McCarthys Spy Is For You Wednesday June 3 2015 at 630 a.m. By Amy Nicholson Melissa McCarthy plays a CIA agent in Spy. Photo by Larry Horricks A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Melissa McCarthy of Spy is different from the one who rose to prominence by shitting in a sink. Bridesmaids scored her an Oscar nomination and for the ceremony McCarthy donned a glamorous rose gown with a diamond collar and belt. But in the years since Hollywood continued to see her as a grotesque. On screen McCarthy has played a parade of morons lunatics losers and bullies. More punching bag than human being shes been hit by car after car and forced to suck Zach Galifianakis used lollipop.But Paul Feig the director who made McCarthy a star has finally written his own script for his muse -- his first screenplay in 12 years. In Spy McCarthy is soft feminine and smart. For a dinner with her CIA co-worker and crush Bradley Fine (Jude Law) her character Susan Cooper curls her hair perfects her makeup and wears a tasteful amber dress. The cruel joke is it doesnt matter. Bradley gives her a plastic cupcake necklace and cackles ""Its so you"" It isnt. Like movie producers he sees only her weight not the dignified woman inside. And the punchline is that Susan allows the insult passively slipping on the monstrosity and later after Bradley is executed by Bulgarian arms dealer Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) clutching it at his funeral.Film DetailsCritics Pick Spy RatingR GenreComedy Running Time120 min. More Info Trailer Though the setting is the CIA there is a Susan in every office invisible patronized and demeaned. A Susan is the woman who remembers cake for everyones birthday but no one remembers hers. Shes competent but never gets her due credit -- a team player stuck warming the bench. Feig has made this film for them.Related StoriesPodcast Heres the Melissa McCarthy Movie Weve Been Waiting ForThis Susan begs to take Bradleys place in Paris to monitor Raynas nuclear sales and its no spoiler to say she winds up on top. Yet Spy isnt a revenge fantasy -- a Susan isnt petty. Its a comedy of exasperation where for once the joke isnt on McCarthy but on everyone who cant see her skills. And its more than that too When Susan is too self-effacing to accept that Bradley shafted her career by sticking his partner in the CIA basement while he took all the field assignments her boss Elaine (Allison Janney) rolls her eyes and groans ""Women.""""Women"" is right. Spy is a call to arms for the cowed and a riotous skewering of the workplace kings be they affectionate and undermining like Bradley the unnervingly perfect Karen (Morena Baccarin) the impatient Elaine or the condescending tech designer who instead of outfitting Susan in slick 007 gear hides her weapons in drugstore items he assumes she uses hemorrhoid wipes stool softener antifungal spray. Forget a glamorous tuxedo. Shes handed a denim purse and told her cover is a single mom from Delaware. McCarthys reaction is perfect. Instead of raging she lets her hurt feelings slip and warbles ""Have I done something to you?""The biggest brute is boneheaded fellow spy Rick Ford (Jason Statham) who dismisses Susan as a ""lunch lady"" and is so convinced she cant handle the job that he stalks her through Europe. His disbelief drags her down -- in one scene literally as she leaps on the landing skids of a helicopter and he leaps after seizing her legs so she cant move.When not sabotaging her mission he brags about his impossible accomplishments the time he defibrillated himself the time he survived a modern-day gladiator ring the time he disguised himself as Barack Obama. Two of those are the plots of actual Statham films -- the coincidence is deliberate. The Statham of Spy is the Statham Ive been wanting since Crank High Voltage proved he had the comic timing of a badass Buster Keaton. Finally unleashed after six years of grim action flicks hes gloriously unhinged.Statham might have the best jokes in the movie but the competition is fierce. Every role is perfectly constructed from Peter Serafinowiczs handsy Italian agent to lanky Miranda Hart as Susans officemate and bumbling best friend. Even Raynas goons get in a few good cracks before theyre dispatched while Rayna herself is a magnificent concoction Marie Antoinette by way of Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface. Byrne slinks through the film in a towering wig changing snakeskin outfits between scenes and ordering peoples executions with a cocked eyebrow. Shes terrifying perfection and you cant wait for Susan to put her in her place -- which to the films credit feels like it might be impossible.

Yet Spy is too sincere about how the rest of the world treats her -- and women like her -- to smack on a stupidly happy ending. Susan might save the day but her battle for respect will never be over. Admitting that universal struggle is better than pretending all a woman needs to redeem herself is a gun. And anyways who needs compliments from bozos like the man who beams ""Maybe one day super-spy Susan Cooper I will fuck you."" McCarthys tired sigh says it all.SPY | Written and directed by Paul Feig | Twentieth Century Fox | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Photo Larry Horricks MOVIE REVIEW Spy Running time 120 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence crude humor). Opens 5 p.m. Thursday. ""Spy"" gets a few things right and one major thing wrong Melissa McCarthy would have made a perfect supervillain. Imagine what she would do to any dumbasses who get in her way The lucky ones would get fed to the sharks. Yet another James Bond parody -- theyve been making those for 50 years now dating back to ""Our Man Flint"" -- this one imagines McCarthy as a desk analyst with a curious streak of hidden aggression. After her chief field agent (Jude Law doing a dodgy American accent) is decommissioned the CIA needs someone invisible to follow a nefarious arms dealer (Rose Byrne). Why not go with the lady whos such a sad case that when sent to fire a gardener she keeps him on and starts mowing lawns herself? Alas ""sad case"" is not how we want to see McCarthy; its frustrating to see her spend more than half the movie being the pathetic target of jokes rather than the dominating figure she was in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat"" both of which are far funnier than this one. All three films were directed by Paul Feig but he didnt write the other two and hes uncertain both with the plot (full of pointless turns) and the jokes (when in doubt he has someones face get stuck next to someones butt). The earlier films (both written by women) each had a much more personal tone; this one is like one of those early-90s pictures made for high-concept purposes alone. (""Well make something called Kindergarten Cop. With Schwarzenegger. Get it?"") Melissa McCarthy and Jude Law in ""Spy.""Photo Larry Horricks So nothing as weirdly endearing as that fridge full of weapons McCarthy kept in ""The Heat."" But lots of scenes with her jumping onto a helicopter racing on a scooter and taking over a crashing plane. Jason Statham though helps take up the slack. Hes a slightly stupid rival agent Ford who goes rogue as the mission jumps from Langley to Paris to Rome to Budapest. When he explains all the ways he cheated death (""I fell out of an airplane then got hit by another airplane"") ""Spy"" touches Monty Python levels of absurdity. Its a setback for McCarthys career to have her play Susan Cooper as the sweet eager-to-please ""lunch lady"" (as Statham calls her); its a little too easy to picture someone who looks like her being ignored by bartenders or given a hideous cupcake necklace on what she thinks is a date. But this line of comedy does open up some possibilities such as the scene where she gets the fancy spy gadgets and all of them are disguised as products a hapless spinster might have on hand -- no joke about the movie ""Beaches"" has ever missed and this one doesnt either. Melissa McCarthy (left) and Miranda HartPhoto Larry Horricks Theres also a pretty funny scene with her best pal (Miranda Hart) when she explains how her mom used to leave her a note in her lunchbox that read ""Give up on your dreams Susan."" This should all have been strictly first-act stuff though; we need to see McCarthy morph into her awesomely rude character from ""The Heat"" but it takes an hour and 10 minutes to get there. At last Susan forced to pretend to being the villains bodyguard lets loose with those trademark Melissa M. profanity-laden insults ""He made you dress like a slutty dolphin trainer?"" ""You look like a perverted bus driver."" ""Your head better not have broken my f - - kin phone."" If they do a sequel (teased in the final seconds) they should cut down on the endless tedious chases and shootouts. The only lethal weapon a McCarthy movie needs is McCarthys sarcasm.

To that end perhaps the highest compliment that can be paid to Paul Feigs frequently hilarious Spy in which the Neighbors star plays a supporting part as a villainous Bulgarian arms dealer named Rayna Boyanov is that Byrne is barely the best thing in it. A femme-friendly riff on the stultified gender roles of the James Bond movies the film kicks off with debonair agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law) doing some quality espionage at a ritzy Eastern Europe cocktail party. Chatting intel into his earpiece from a bat-infested basement back at the CIA is Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) a 40-year-old woman whos been on the job for 10 years without spending a single day in the field. No one takes Susan seriously and the disrespect of her friends and colleagues has had a predictable effect on her self-worth. (Her mom used to write ""Give up on your dreams Susan"" in her lunchbox.) But when Bradley fulfills his transparent function in the story by reestablishing the suave chauvinism of the spy genre and then getting shot in the face Susan is inspired to take action avenge her fallen partner and stop Rayna from selling a nuke to anti-American terrorists. The action Susan takes isnt particularly compelling--despite shiny production values the heros breasts arent the only reason that Spy wont be confused with Skyfall anytime soon--but the jokes often land with deadly force. The tricksy plot allows McCarthy to explore the full range of her comic persona and Feig is smart enough to get out of her way as the mild-mannered Susan starts wielding f-bombs as comfortably as Bond whips around a Walther PPK. Although the laughs begin to trickle as the film zigzags to the finish line McCarthys gobsmacking improv skills have never been more brilliant than when shes volleying one-liners with an old-school rival agent (Jason Statham legendary). And though its been two years since they collaborated on The Heat Spy makes the case that Feig and McCarthy are still just warming up.

Maybe thats because of sexism or maybe its just old-fashioned cluelessness which come to think of it may amount to the same thing. Either way the answers been obvious all along Put the woman in any damn thing she pleases. Shes that good. Since the riff-happy whirling dervish broke out in 2011s Bridesmaids shes been in some good movies and some less-good ones. But shes always stood out in a sea of cinematic sameness. McCarthys mind just seems to race in a faster gear than her costars allowing her to blast off arias of profane put-downs with such speed and demented originality that her mouth practically shoots sparks. As a physical comedian she possesses the greatest gift of all Shes totally unafraid of looking stupid. McCarthys latest film Spy reunites the actress with her patron saint Paul Feig (Bridesmaids The Heat) and the duo has finally come up with a role that feels richer than a sketch-comedy premise. McCarthy plays Susan Cooper an unassuming unassertive CIA desk jockey who from a rat-infested basement deep in the bowels of Langley guides the agencys top spies on their license-to-kill missions via an earpiece. One of these suave American 007s is played by Jude Law who despite his flair with a pistol and a glass of pinot noir is oblivious to the fact that Cooper harbors a not-so-secret crush on him. Then during an assignment to take out a Bulgarian villain with a rogue nuke hes killed. And the bad guys sneeringly bitchy daughter Rayna (Rose Byrne quickly becoming comedys most valuable foil) claims to know the identities of all of the CIAs covert spies including a blowhard played by Jason Statham who has a blast skewering his Cockney tough-guy persona. To cut to the chase the agency needs an unknown operative to take down Rayna. Enter McCarthy in a parade of dumpy disguises and homely cat-lady wigs. Cooper turns out to be deceptively lethal in the field not only kicking Euro goon ass but barking so many hilarious insults--the best of which are far too filthy to print--youll wonder how many were in Feigs script and how many McCarthys dizzyingly dirty mind hatched on the spot especially during her venomous verbal cutting contests with Byrne and her scenes with an insatiably horny Italian agent (Peter Serafinowicz). Still Spy isnt without a few rough spots. The recurring 50 Cent cameo isnt as funny as the movie seems to think it is. The frantic pace of the films first half goes a little slack in the second as it gets more action-centric (not exactly Feigs specialty). And while I get that part of McCarthys shtick is beating others to the punch of how shes not what a typical leading lady looks like Im beginning to wish she didnt feel the need to any more. With the run shes been on shes earned that much. Honestly though she can do whatever she wants at this point. Just as long as she works as much as possible. After all who else is going to show the boys how its done?

"Spy Review A Brilliant Showcase for Melissa McCarthy | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews SXSW Film Review Spy Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 7 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 16 2015 | 0408AM PT Melissa McCarthy gets the funniest most versatile and sustained comic showcase of her movie career in this deliriously entertaining action-comedy. If recent misfires like ""Tammy"" and ""Identity Thief"" have proved anything its that Melissa McCarthy is virtually indestructible retaining her comic buoyancy her tremendous likability and much of her fan base even when stuck with bargain-basement material. All of which makes it even more gratifying to see what she can do with a vehicle thats firing on all cylinders for a change. In ""Spy"" an uproarious blast of globe-trotting action-comedy delirium that doesnt spoof the espionage-thriller genre so much as drop a series of banana peels in its path McCarthy plays an eager-to-please desk jockey turned full-blown CIA operative who learns to wield a gun as skillfully as she does a one-liner -- a dazzling transformation that represents the actresss smartest funniest most versatile and fully sustained bigscreen showcase to date. Unsurprisingly her key collaborator here is once again Paul Feig who directed her to such show-stopping effect in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat"" and Foxs June 5 release will more than earn its place in the company of those past summer hits. If ""The Heat"" (2013) placed its righteous gender politics front and center pairing McCarthy with Sandra Bullock as a happy corrective to the male-dominated buddy-comedy tradition then ""Spy"" a vastly richer and more intricately conceived piece of work succeeds in scoring a subtler representational coup. To call it feminist would hardly be inaccurate but it might risk diminishing the singularity of McCarthys achievement Its not every woman (and certainly not every man) who can juggle the often-conflicting priorities of action and comedy as skillfully as she does here. Put another way its hard to think of another performer male or female who could leap onto a motorcycle and immediately topple over sideways and pull off the gag with such fumbling precision -- or is it precise fumbling? -- that it can only be described as graceful. Admittedly Susan Cooper (McCarthy) a fortysomething analyst stuck behind a desk in a vermin-ridden basement at CIA headquarters doesnt seem wired for action at first. The film opens with an extended combat sequence in Bulgaria where a suave James Bond type named Bradley Fine (Jude Law) blows away a series of thugs as he tries to locate a nuclear bomb. His secret weapon however turns out to be Susan who communicates with Fine via hidden earpiece using all manner of high-tech surveillance equipment to maneuver him past every obstacle and enemy assailant. Its a highly effective working relationship albeit one that invariably leaves the hard-working Susan feeling more like a secretary or assistant than an equal never mind that she has years of successful field training under her belt. It doesnt help that shes nursing a major unrequited crush on Fine who much like everyone else looks at her and sees a single middle-aged overweight loner whose Agency career has probably already peaked. But when Fine is suddenly assassinated by a haughty Bulgarian arms dealer named Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) who somehow knows the identities of all the CIAs top operatives Susan becomes determined to enter the field herself for the first time and avenge her partners death arguing that shes the only one who wont be recognized. Against the protests of surly agent Richard Ford (Jason Statham hilariously sending up his meathead persona) the Agency chief (Allison Janney) reluctantly agrees though she forbids Susan to put herself in harms way and sends her to Paris on a basic track-and-report mission. Should her intel prove valuable it could lead them not only to Rayna but also to Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale) a greasy-haired terrorist whos trying to acquire the nuke for his own nefarious loosely Al Qaeda-related reasons. (The plot outlined here at lightning speed never makes more sense than it has to.) Feigs beautifully structured zinger-stuffed screenplay mines no shortage of amusement from the spectacle of Susan being briefed and prepped for duty The Agencys resident Q type fills her purse with high-tech gadgets all sadly disguised as items that a woman like her would carry (hemorrhoid patches stool softeners etc.). Meanwhile every phony alias and passport shes assigned is invariably that of some frumpy Midwestern tourist; as Susan notes ""I look like someones homophobic aunt."" The comedy here has a shrewd double edge On a certain level Feig and McCarthy may well be inviting us to laugh at the sight of Susan in a bouffant wig and an oversized cat T-shirt but theyre also taking deliberate aim at the sort of mentality that would write her off as a hopelessly unattractive loser in the first place. Eventually Susans mission takes her from Paris to Rome to Budapest -- guided via earpierce by her easily excitable colleague Nancy (the delightfully dithering Miranda Hart) and accompanied much of the time by an overly amorous Italian associate Aldo (British actor Peter Serafinowicz). Eventually Susan is required to drop the ugly-American guise and pass herself off as Raynas personal bodyguard -- an inspired masquerade that necessitates the sort of radiant physical makeover that between this and ""Identity Thief"" might well become a semi-regular Melissa McCarthy movie trope. More crucially however it allows the actresss head-butting expletive-hurling take-no-prisoners personality to emerge in full force as Susan puts aside her earlier timidity and taps into the inner core of rage that as neatly foreshadowed in the script once made her one of the CIAs most promising (and vicious) trainees before she was sidelined into a desk job. Whether shes dangling from the bottom of a helicopter slamming a metal pot over the head of a knife-wielding assassin (Bollywood actress Nargis Fakhri) vomiting in disbelief over the corpse of a henchman shes just eliminated or kicking the crap out of some ""Swedish motherf--er"" just for the hell of it McCarthys performance is a never-ending succession of priceless moments. For all her strengths as a verbal and physical performer theres a real core of emotion here too; remarkably she manages to pull all these disparate extremes of violence and comedy into a stirring coherent portrait of a woman motivated by love loyalty and a courageous if unrealized sense of her own inner worth. For some the term ""action-comedy hybrid"" may trigger dire memories of earlier studio mediocrities like ""Knight and Day"" ""Killers"" and ""The Bounty Hunter"" in which the two genres blended about as harmoniously as oil and water. By contrast ""Spy"" gets the balance almost exactly right predicated on the eminently sensible notion that a well-timed verbal jab can help punch up an action scene while a high-speed car chase can only be improved with some discreet breast groping. Even when the violence catches you off guard with its sudden ferocity it works in no small part because Feig avoiding the surreal silliness of an ""Austin Powers""-style sendup maintains a surprisingly straight face even as he pursues a humorously skewed angle on the world of international espionage. In keeping with this approach the actors have mastered the art of inhabiting two different worlds simultaneously tossing off even their funnier lines without breaking character. Having emerged as a comedic powerhouse in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Neighbors"" Byrne is no less brilliant here with her crimson lips mile-high coiffure and supreme hauteur. Stathams Ford staying out of the action spotlight for a change is mainly on hand to perform an ongoing riff in which he tries to convince Susan shes not cut out for the job rattling off various examples of his own tolerance for extreme pain (i.e. having to sew one arm back on with the other) that could well have been ripped from the many indifferent shoot-em-ups littering his resume. Law clearly having fun playing Bond for a day brings an extra shot of star power to the across-the-board superb supporting cast. The films scenic international locations and spy-thriller orientation have called forth a much higher level of technical polish than usual for a studio comedy as evidenced by d.p. Robert Yeomans slick lensing Jefferson Sages elaborate production design a sexy-satirical Bond-style opening credits sequence and action scenes of startlingly visceral impact (some of them achieved with some noticeable digital tweaking). The print reviewed at SXSW didnt include closing credits leaving an incomplete running time of 115 minutes. SXSW Film Review SpyReviewed at SXSW Film Festival (Headliners) March 15 2015.

BarryWilson (tikofanster) says August 29 2015 at 739 pm Hilarious Movie. Terribly written review. Reviewing a film is not an excuse to write 15 percent analysis. 85 percent retelling the plot including revealing the punchlines. Which is why I dont read reviews before seeing a film. Movie reviewer for variety big title little talent. I will explain something you dont understand. Some action comedies are ACTION comedies and some are COMEDY action. Knight and Day was very entertaining. But it was the opposite of this movie. Her best so far. But the other two you pad your review denigrating were great fun with lots of laughs. But in the world people like you get to keep their jobs no matter how poorly they do them Reply Amanda Jane Burton says June 13 2015 at 1230 am Bill R it was brilliantly written and directed. I am absolutely in awe of the achievement sorry it didnt speak to you and still chuckling hours later. Bravo Reply Bill R says June 10 2015 at 1206 am I actually walked out of this film. It was so poorly written and directed. How can Variety give it a thumbs up? Melissa McCarthy was great in The Heat and Bridesmaids. This was just plain awful. Reply Thomas Watson says June 5 2015 at 648 pm Its kind of brilliant that they casted Jason Statham in this film - hes got the same thing going on in that hes often typecast as supercilious badass who may or may not be just supremely lucky. Reply Jim Hillmeyer says June 5 2015 at 955 am Uh Mr. Chang thanks for telling us that the Fine character gets assassinated. How about a spoiler alert or better yet DONT give away key plot information like that A review isnt a synopsis of events; its a critique. Reply Justin Chang says June 11 2015 at 106 am Its not even remotely a spoiler. Reply Thomas Watson says June 3 2015 at 1133 pm Its a firecracker of an action comedy equipped with a smart screenwriter a classic retro Bond feel and some stellar performances.

Daily Edition Login to download Spy Film Review 920 PM PDT 3/15/2015 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An action-comedy home run that expands McCarthys playbook TWITTER Melissa McCarthy shows Jason Statham and Jude Law how the action-hero game is played. Melissa McCarthy comes into her own as a comic star in Spy stepping out from recent supporting- and co-headlining roles to become the big screen A-lister she promised to be in 2011s Bridesmaids. Lampooning the alpha-male conventions of the secret agent flick while transferring some of that badassery to an unlikely character writer-director Paul Feig remains one of the best friends women in comedy have managing to get yuks from fat-lady jokes while mocking a world that treats such women like theyre invisible. Laugh-stuffed and making excellent use of its marquee-grade supporting cast it promises to be a home run in its early summer release. McCarthys Susan Cooper starts off where wed expect to find a woman like her in a blockbuster action film as one of the anonymous keyboard jockeys behind the hero Jude Laws Bond-like Bradley Fine. Shes the voice in his earpiece watching via satellite and doing his homework so he can magically dodge each attacker and infiltrate any fortress. Shes also hopelessly in love with him a fact Fine exploits with shameless ""I couldnt do it without you"" flirting. Read more Ghostbusters Remake Eyes Melissa McCarthy to Star But Hurdles Remain When Fine is taken out of commission by an arms dealer (Rose Byrne a perfectly haughty aristocrat) who declares she knows the identity of every active agent who might stop her the CIA reluctantly turns to Cooper who was trained as a field agent before getting stuck at a desk. Shes sent on a ""track and report"" mission ordered to observe Byrnes movements but not repeat not to engage anyone personally. As if to ensure she wont get ideas above her station Coopers handlers equip her with the most frumpy cover ID ever imagined. (And amusingly high-tech gizmos to match.) Her nervous-Nellie pal Nancy (Miranda Hart) will fill in on desk-jockey duty with occasional field help from Aldo (Peter Serafinowicz) an Italian loverboy with a refreshing fondness for full-figured women. While she bounces around exotic locales in pursuit of Byrnes suitcase-sized nuclear device Coopers biggest headache is not the villains but the good guys As a British spy who cant stand to be sidelined while a woman does his job Jason Statham keeps popping up where hes not supposed to be trying to take down the baddies but just making things worse. (Statham is surprisingly good at sending up this macho numbskulls overconfidence especially when he tries to establish his bona fides with a hilariously outlandish list of things hes endured in the line of duty.) Read more 50 Cent Joins Melissa McCarthy in Spy (Exclusive) Cooper is a much milder character than McCarthys previous film roles a woman who cares what other people think of her and yearns to please. But as shes quietly saving the day for the dozenth time circumstances force her to invent a new cover for herself -- lucky for us one that allows her to unleash the foul-mouthed hilarious assertiveness we expect. She stays in character though delivering a coherent performance in a spoof that follows suit spinning a more sensible plot than most ""serious"" spy films. Sandra Bullock McCarthys co-star in The Heat made something like an antecedent to Spy with Miss Congeniality. There a tomboy had to master chasing crooks in high heels; here McCarthys girth lends physical comedy to the action scenes. She owns those laughs though maintaining more self-respect than many plus-sized male comedians before her. In his third big femme-centric film in a row (and the first he has scripted) Feig puts himself in the service of female characters who share more with the women in the audience than with stock Hollywood stereotypes. Susan Coopers seriously vicious fight with a knife-wielding supermodel may not be the subtlest example of this brand of multiplex-friendly feminism. But like so much else here it sure is fun.

Her ""Bridesmaids"" character might be brash and inappropriate but shes got high-level nuclear security clearance while her detective in ""The Heat"" was both a damn good cop and a sexual dynamo with many heartbroken men in her wake. ""Spy"" her latest team-up with director Paul Feig (who also wrote the script) takes the actress particular set of skills to its broadest canvas yet allowing her to globe-trot from Paris to Rome to Budapest as CIA agent Susan Cooper who surprises not just those around her but also herself with her adeptness in the field. See Video Melissa McCarthy Steps in for Secret Agents Jason Statham Jude Law in First Spy Trailer (Video) Susan a ten-year vet at the agency has been content to languish in the rodent-infested basement at Langley where shes been the eyes and ears of Bradley Fine (Jude Law) a suave super-spy who blithely shoots and quips his way through dangerous situations only thanks to Susans via-satellite guidance. When arms dealer Rayna (a delectably bitchy Rose Byrne) reveals she knows the identities of all the CIAs top agents in the field only the unknown Susan can track down the woman whos intent on selling a rogue nuke to the nefarious DeLuca (Bobby Cannavale). But despite her skill with a headset and a computer screen Susan gets no respect at the office; her deadpan boss (Allison Janney) gives her a series of frumpy undercover identities (""I look like someones homophobic aunt"" laments Susan) and even her cool spy gadgets are disguised to look like stool softener toe-fungus spray and hemorrhoid wipes. Susans orders are to track and report at a distance but of course she winds up getting up close and personal with Rayna. Their relationship consists of them taking turns being nastily dismissive of each other and McCarthy and Byrnes scenes together are cruelly hilarious with the kind of no-holds-barred insult humor that makes you instinctively drop your jaw and cover your mouth. Also Read Ernie Hudson Changes Tune on All-Girl Ghostbusters Cast Calls It Phenomenal What Feig does so well here is to take the spy story just seriously enough to keep us engaged (although he could probably have put Susan onto the playing field five or ten minutes earlier) while also giving McCarthy a number of sharp comic foils. Besides Byrne and Janney she gets to play off Jason Statham (as a fellow spy who refuses to take her seriously -- to Susans credit she never backs down from his bullying) Miranda Hart (the ""Call the Midwife"" star plays one of Susans basement buddies) and Peter Serafinowicz (as a handsy Italian ally). Also Read 15 Gotta-See Movies at SXSW 2015 Ryan Gosling Kevin Hart Christina Hendricks Freed from the PG-13 shackles of most straightforward spy movies ""Spy"" actually offers up more blood and vivid violence than the genre its tweaking but never enough to get in the way of the comedy. If anything the occasional mayhem reminds us of the danger Susans putting herself in while also underscoring how cartoony many contemporary espionage dramas have become. ""Spy"" would be a standout if only for its ability to keep me laughing while also keeping me from figuring out who was really double-crossing whom. Add to that this extraordinary ensemble of actors (who knew Jason Statham could be this funny?) and youve got another memorable offering from McCarthy and Feig. Underestimate them at your peril.
