Though its refreshing to see a prestige picture pass the Bechdel test with flying colors -- hell this movie basically consists of two women talking about everything but men -- vet Magyar director Istvan Szabos ""The Door"" is unfortunately starchy and conventional in just about every other respect. This unmoving English-language adaptation of Magda Szabos bestselling page-turner stars a deglammed Helen Mirren as a disagreeable cleaning lady hired by a bourgeois novelist played by Martina Gedeck in 1960s Hungary. Already released in Mitteleuropa in a (no doubt superior) dubbed version this mothball-scented Europudding-accented drama wont open many other theatrical doors. The novel by Szabo no relation of the director is a cleverly constructed partially autobiographical work that aims for a big emotional payoff as it slowly reveals why the no-nonsense Emerenc (Mirren) the working-class cleaner of well-off writer Magda (Gedeck) is so secretive about her past lets no one into her modest home and has particularly outspoken views on life politics religion and peoples role in society. Though technically a servant Emerenc clearly doesnt tolerate other people telling her what to do. But the many contradictions in her character and the conflicts this generates with her station and complicated past are never convincingly drawn. To complicate matters even further the screenplay by Szabo and Andrea Veszits is unable to suggest why Magda even less of a developed character than Emerenc would keep on a hand who not only has a habit of telling off her employer but who comes and goes at ungodly hours. Add to this the conspicuous lack of a larger political and historical context -- personal freedom and labor-related obligations would seem like subjects that would resonate in a Soviet-communist framework -- and the pic becomes an unconvincing and rather dull series of scenes in which two women talk a lot but dont say all that much. When the film gets around to the big reveal after numerous color-drained flashbacks its more of a shoulder-shrugging moment than an emotional thunderclap. Mirren as frumpy as shes ever been onscreen but with her trademark steely demeanor intact is fine as Emerenc somehow making the intermittently stilted dialogue sound almost natural. Gedeck (""The Lives of Others"") playing essentially a spectator to Emerencs unraveling struggles to develop any interest in her character and occasionally sounds awkward in English. At least her lines havent been dubbed in what sounds like an echo chamber as is the case with some of the supporting characters such as Tibor (Karoly Eperjes) Magdas pleasant but narratively superfluous husband. Apart from the dialogue and contextual issues Szabo has crafted another technically impeccable feature. Lensing by Elemer Ragalyi with its warm sunlight in summer and cold white-skied luminosity in winter feels conventional but is otherwise immaculate. A similar verdict can be rendered over Volker Shaefers production design and Gyorgyi Szakacs costumes. Recurring musical leitmotif further adds to the pics old-fashioned feel.

A nifty little fantasy-thriller that could be even better in the English-lingo remake it cries out for ""The Door"" builds some credible drama from its central idea of a deadbeat given a second chance at life following a tragic accident. Moodily directed by Anno Saul (""Kebab Connection"") this genre item is let down by an overly blank performance from Danish thesp Mads Mikkelsen (""Casino Royale"") here dubbed into German and a finale that doesnt quite deliver dramatically. But the strong supporting cast and clever plot twists make this worth a look for genre aficionados and fantasy fests. ""Door"" opened mildly in Deutschland in late November. David Andernach (Mikkelsen) is a successful painter with a nice house in the burbs; an attractive wife Maja (Jessica Schwarz); and a cute young daughter Leonie (Valeria Eisenbart). But one bright summers day when he should have been hunting butterflies with Leonie David is busy servicing his horny mistress Gia (Heike Makatsch in a cameo) around the corner -- and comes back to find that Leonie has drowned after tripping into the family pool. Five years later in winter Max is a scruffy wreck and Maja has divorced him. But after trying to kill himself in the self-same pool hes led by a butterfly to a hidden tunnel that opens onto ... the very day Leonie died. Script by Jan Berger (""Kebab Connection"" ""FC Venus"") from a 2001 novel by Akif Pirincci -- dubbed Germanys Stephen King -- delivers some nice ironies early on as David sees his original self heading off to see Gia and realizes he has a chance to rescue Leonie if he runs fast. This he does but not without attracting the attention of his earlier self and soon enough Davids life is starting to unravel all over again albeit in a different way. As the time-bending (and brain-bending) twists pile up the pic isnt quite slick enough to sustain the suspension of disbelief needed to make it work as a pure genre item. Helmer Saul and the cast are better at capturing the small behavioral niceties particularly Majas and Leonies suspicions that everything isnt quite right. Both Schwarz (""The Red Cockatoo"") and Eisenbart (10 at the time) are very good in these roles though they get little help from Mikkelsens cold unengaging perf. Thomas Thieme as a jovial neighbor adds some dramatic heft as the plot pulls its final switcheroo but the subsequent finale lacks a satisfyingly physical punch. Technical package is fine with flavorsome summer/winter widescreen lensing by Bella Halben in Potsdam and Hamburg and atmospheric scoring by Fabian Roemer.

In The Spy Next Door Chan plays Bob Ho an undercover spy who masquerades as a dweeby pen salesman. Amber Valletta is Bobs suburban neighbor and girlfriend a single mother of three kids who give Bob a hard time. Save room for some tediously cartoonish Russian spies George Lopez as a cartoonish CIA boss a shaggy Billy Ray Cyrus as a fellow spook and a lot of perfunctory kid shenanigans. Under the circumstances some characteristically inventive Chan martial arts choreography involving household objects -- fridge frying pan pet turtle -- is gratefully appreciated.

Deploy them as weapons. Jackie Chan should get some applause for his appropriation of child actors in The Spy Next Door (watch the kid fly). Actually his goofy slapstick stunts - devised with his personal team - are perfect for children and pretty good fun. As for the rest this is a lazy spin on the action-veteran-left-holding-the-baby wheeze (Kindergarten Cop The Pacifier). Chan is the nerdy guy next door who is dating the little horrors mother. But really hes a Chinese agent on loan to the CIA. Theres also a Russian oligarch on his tail with a dastardly plan to destroy the worlds oil reserves assisted by a clutch of henchmen and the requisite foxy villainess. It comes with the usual kids stuff wedgies for the boys adorably skittish pets for the girls. Even the outtakes barely raise a smile. The best of them sees Chan fluffing his lines I hate English he mumbles. Who can blame him when its as grindingly predictable as this?

Former CIA spy Bob Ho (Jackie Chan) takes on his toughest assignment to date looking after his girlfriends three kids who havent exactly warmed up to their moms beau. Photo COLLEEN HAYES ASSOCIATED PRESS The Spy Next Door 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Spy Next Dooris notThe Pacifier. Yeah sure it features a big-name action star as a secret agent (or Navy SEAL) who assumes baby-sitting duties for a comely single mom. Both films contain snotty kids eccentric pets (a pig in one a duck in the other) and none-too-competent bad guys of foreign persuasion. Neither one marks an artistic zenith for family cinema. But they are not the same movie. They are not. For one thing and this is key The Spy Next Door doesnt star Vin Diesel. Nothing against the guy -- under rare and magical circumstances he can act -- but he lacks any sort of comic knack or gift for self-effacement. Jackie Chan on the other hand? His natural state of being is the sunny obliviousness of a perpetual kid. That wide rubbery smile rarely fails him even when hes kicking the pants off lumpen malefactors and even when the vehicle hes starring in underwhelms while it overworks cliches. Its a good thing too because there isnt much else to recommend this by-the-book action comedy a mostly inoffensive nothing of a film with one or two mild chuckles and lots of chop-socky commotion. Chans character is Bob Ho an undercover Chinese mega-spy whos been working for the C.I.A. and plans to retire soon. The comely mother in this case is a rather wan specimen played by Amber Valletta. Two of the snotty kids (Madeline Carroll Will Shadley) are indefatigably excrutiatingly hateful while the third (Alina Foley) is a certified pip-voiced moppet. Aside from Chans genial mugging the only amusing (which is to say idiotic) bits of The Spy Next Door involve Magnus Scheving and Katherine Boecher as a couple of sneering villains with Boris-and-Natasha accents (""You weel pay for that leetle Amyerican preencess""). At some point the social mores that functionally banned most other forms of ethnic stereotyping will catch up with the Slavs a sad day indeed for middling screenwriters. Three of them claim responsibility for this particular effort Jonathan Bernstein James Greer and Gregory Poirier. Just one director is credited Brian Levant a purveyor of energetic if run-of-the-mill kid flicks who made the marginally funnier Snow Dogs and Are We There Yet? He traffics in animals children and the good-natured humiliation of his male leads. Its worth noting or maybe it isnt that both Billy Ray Cyrus and George Lopez boast small roles as Chans colleagues in the C.I.A. Cyruss role is to spit out folksy truisms that distract us from his hair. Lopezs role such as it is becomes clear as the plot unfolds such as it does and heaven forbid I spoil either one.

Jackie Chan and Alina Foley star in The Spy Next Door. Good-bye Rush Hour hello comedic gridlock Add to ... Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 14 2010 106PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Spy Next Door Directed by Brian Levant Written by Jonathan Bernstein James Greer and Gregory Poirier Starring Jackie Chan Lucas Till Amber Valletta George Lopez and Billy Ray Cyrus Classification PG What does an action-movie superstar do when hes past his physical peak but still has box-office mojo - aside from running for governor of California? Career transition can be painful. The latest evidence is Jackie Chans The Spy Next Door (or as I prefer to call it Jackie Chans Adventures in Babysitting). Chan has been tumbling and rumbling since his days as a child performer in the 1960s. He moved swiftly from stuntman to star moving back and forth between the movie capitals of Hong Kong and Hollywood cementing his celebrity with humanitarian and creative endeavours. When Hollywood first came knocking he smartly avoided stereotypical Asian-villain roles his singular blend of comedy and martial-arts acrobatics finding successful mainstream expression in buddy movies with Chris Tucker ( Rush Hour and two sequels) and Owen Wilson ( Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights ). After decades of performing his own stunts and breaking numerous bones Chan certainly deserves more restful roles. His turn as the wise martial-arts teacher in the reboot of The Karate Kid  due this summer sounds like a good fit. But for now we have Bob Ho a middle-aged Chinese superspy on loan to the CIA whom we meet on the eve of his early retirement. Bob has been pitching woo with his suburban divorcee neighbour Gillian (Amber Valetta) who thinks hes an ink salesman. On a date that gives us our first (and sadly not last) glimpse of the couples inert chemistry Bob is called to a final mission during which he successfully captures a cartoonish Russian villain. The next morning Bob wakes up a civilian ready to pursue domestic bliss with his neighbour. But pitfalls and pratfalls are just around the corner. For starters Gillians three highly annoying offspring (a lisping little girl a nerdy brainiac tween son and a surly teenage daughter) think hes a loser. Gillian is suddenly called out of town on an emergency so Bob volunteers to babysit hoping more face time will win them over. Chans comedic gifts and still-nimble moves are wasted in a string of unimaginative household calamities and practical jokes. When he asks his old CIA pal to loan him some spy gear to help keep the kids in order its supposed to be funny but in terms of the character feels like a cop-out. Time to call in those crazy Russians to liven things up. Seems brainiac boy has downloaded a file from Bobs computer which turns out to be a secret formula. The Russian villain who has escaped custody reunites with his bumbling henchmen and blond vixen girlfriend. As they close in on the files location - using the latest in villain-tracking technology - Bob and the kids find themselves in increasing danger. Ooh ... Ive got a feeling mom is not going to like this. Chan fans wont either. The Spy Next Door targets the family audience (note the casting of Billy Ray Cyrus father of Miley as Bobs CIA pal) with the kind of strained story and hijinks weve come to expect from veteran family-film director Brian Levant ( Beethoven  Snow Dogs ) who guided Arnold Schwarzenegger through his final screen comedy in 1996s Jingle All The Way . The films opening credits run over a montage of stylized clips from Chans early work (to the tune of Secret Agent Man ); end credits feature the gag reel he always delivers. And although Chans tremendous screen charisma is mostly undercover throughout I suspect The Spy Next Door is just a misstep on the road to his next act.

(Colleen Hayes) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 14 2010 627 PM Title The Spy Next Door Cold out there isnt it? Well promise us you wont make the mistake of ducking into a movie theater just for some heat this month. Like ""Leap Year"" last week ""The Spy Next Door"" is classic January junk the sort of movie evidently made to go straight to DVD. That it wound up onscreen may be some sort of tribute to star Jackie Chan who remains likable under the most trying circumstances. Of course that only makes us feel worse for him stuck as he is in this cartoonish family flick. The movie even has the nerve to start with a montage of moments from his better films a bad idea that sets off an escalating tumble downhill. The always enthusiastic Chan plays Bob Ho a nerdy salesman who has somehow lucked into romance with gorgeous single mom Gillian (Amber Valletta). While shes ready to marry him her three kids are distinctly unimpressed by the bland Bob. But he has a secret Hes actually a CIA spy targeted by Russian assassins. Before you can say ""Didnt Vin Diesel already make this movie?"" he gets stuck with a baby-sitting gig and the kids are awed by his cool gadgets and kung fu moves. If only we could be so easily impressed. The script -- which took three people to write -- is barely coherent and its unclear whether Brian Levant was even on set when he directed. All thats left for us to enjoy are the action scenes and frankly most of those are a little depressing. Chan is 55 and has beaten his body up pretty badly over the years so its not like we expect miracles. But the movie is edited within an inch of its life so if he did a single trick on his own you wont know it. As for barely-there co-stars Billy Ray Cyrus and George Lopez did they really need the extra paycheck? The action is heavy enough to be aimed at older kids but anyone above 8 wont have the patience for the goofy plot. Which is good news for you In this weather its easier (and cheaper) to just stay indoors. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Spy Next Door Kid-oriented action will have adults rolling their eyes | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Spy Next Door Kid-oriented action will have adults rolling their eyesIt seems a new era of detente has opened between the U.S. and China if you can swallow the concept of secret agent Bob Ho (played by Jackie Chan) working on special assignment with American intelligence.Once again Jackie Chan grabs anything handy for a prop.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. Jan. 15 2010  Starring Jackie Chan Amber Valletta. 92 minutes. Directed by Brian Levant. At major theatres. PG It seems a new era of detente has opened between the U.S. and China if you can swallow the concept of secret agent Bob Ho (played by Jackie Chan) working on special assignment with American intelligence.And if you can handle that stretch of the imagination the rest of The Spy Next Door is a breeze Article Continued Below that Ho and his next-door neighbour after dating for three months are in love; that her kids dont like him; that one final mission involving Russian villains and a compound that sops up oil like a roll of super-Bounty puts them all in danger and that all this brings them together as one big happy family.The Spy Next Door is clearly aimed at a younger audience. Adults accompanying them to the theatre are likely to spend a fair bit of the film with their eyes rolling skyward.Chan is actually a fairly likeable hero and his elocution never great is at least passable in this latest romp. He also is renowned for doing all his own stunts and his ability to use folding chairs and various kitchen aids to bop and bruise his opponents here is as innovative and captivating as always.Ho is left in charge of his sweethearts kids while she attends to a sick relative so we actually get more screen time with them - a haughty teenager girl who dresses like a harlot a brainy younger brother and a cute-as-a-bug little girl who likes wearing pink ... as well as a cat a turtle (who comes in handy at one point) and a pot-bellied pig.Along for the ride are funnyman George Lopez and Billy Ray Cyrus (with a soul patch and the very worst haircut in the history of movies). Worst still Cyruss character spouts such homespun wisdom as ""dont get married just find someone youll hate in five years and give her your house."" Magnus Scheving and Katherine Boecher have some fun hamming it up as the Russian baddies.Not to worry violence is of the slapstick rather than the shoot-to-kill variety. In fact this film is far tamer than the average video game. The only real risk is that young gamers are going to find The Spy Next Door as dull as us older folk.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Jackie Chan Amber Valletta Madeline Carroll Will Shadley Alina Foley Magnus Scheving Katherine Boecher Lucas Till Billy Ray Cyrus George Lopez Director Brian Levant Running time 132 Release Opened Jan 15 2010  Editorial Review No high flying for Jackie ChanBy Michael OSullivanFriday Jan. 15 2010Cut from the same cloth as ""Are We There Yet?"" -- and unsurprisingly directed by the same guy (Brian Levant) -- ""The Spy Next Door"" is yet another lazily kid-pleasing comedy about a man unprepared for fatherhood whos suddenly saddled with children who hate his guts and whom he must win over in order to make time with their hot single mom.In the 2005 movie the main character was a playboy bachelor (Ice Cube) reluctantly chauffeuring his lady friends children across the country for a New Years Eve rendezvous with Mom (Nia Long). In ""Spy"" its Bob Ho (Jackie Chan) a career intelligence agent on loan from China to the CIA who finds himself taking care of his girlfriend Gillians (Amber Valletta) three brats when shes called out of town on a family medical emergency.Cue the scene of ruined breakfast.Why do these children (Madeline Carroll Will Shadley and Alina Foley) hate Bob so? Because as far as they know hes a tired old man. Passing himself off as a dweeby pen salesman Bob has somehow managed to keep his secret life of ninja derring-do hidden from Gillian and her family who live next door to him in a quiet California suburb.Unfortunately Chan makes Bobs cover story a little too believable.The now 55-year-old martial arts star isnt the rubber-limbed gymnast he once was. Chans goofy high-wattage charm may still burn brightly behind Bobs black geek glasses. But the performers famously high-wire acrobatics are for the most part absent. One of the most daring stunts consists of rescuing a cat thats gotten itself stuck on Gillians roof. Like Bob the rest of the film rarely gets off the ground again.Thats even taking into consideration the fact that Russian mobsters are trying to hunt Bob down and kill him. Why? It seems they need a top-secret computer file that one of the children has unwittingly downloaded to his iPod.Kids todayTheres sufficient ""Daddy Day Care""-style mayhem here to please the films elementary-school-age audience. Not to mention enough sugar to cover the next few Halloweens. If youre a sucker for lines like ""I want Bob to be my daddy"" -- uttered by Foley whos still got several more cute movies in her before she turns into Lindsay Lohan -- this is the movie for you. ""The Spy Next Door"" may not have a license to kill but it gets the job done.On the other hand you may just want to wait for the DVD. As someone in the movie says about Bob -- and I think they meant it as a compliment -- the movie may be boring but its a dependable babysitter.At area theaters. Contains mild action sequences and tepid martial arts. 92 minutes.

Whats hard is taking care of three school-age kids. Harder still is sitting for ones who are resentful that youre dating Mom.Sound like the 2005 comedy The Pacifier with Vin Diesel as the Navy SEAL-turned-babysitter? Yes but the rubber-jointed Chan is nimbler and his physical comedy droller. He may be 55 but the martial-arts star still has bounce.So does Brian Levants formula comedy about a stolen Russian formula. Chan plays ""pen salesman"" Bob Ho (he was Chon Wang - pronounced John Wayne - in Shanghai Noon) the bespectacled and sweater-vested neighbor of single mom Gillian (Amber Valletta). They adore each other.But her kids 13 11 and 4 all high-maintenance think Bobs a supergeek. Theyll do anything to keep Mom single. Then Gillians father has an accident and Bob - whos retiring from the spy biz - volunteers to take care of her brood in order to win their hearts.Initially the logistics of getting them fed to bed breakfasted and to school defy Bobs formidable skills. Their needs are so different Sulky Farren (Madeline Carroll) 13 needs an authority to be anti-. Brainiac Ian (Will Shadley) 11 needs a male role model. Hyper Nora (Alina Foley) 4 needs limits.But Bob who can leap small buildings in a single bound is a quick study. Within 24 hours hes rigged monitoring devices to enforce bedtimes and wake-up calls. And perfected the slingshot technique to get Nora out of day clothes and into her nightgown. With some industrial-grade uranium Bob can simultaneously make three breakfasts and bag lunches.But just when Bob thinks hes out of the CIA they pull him back in. They need him to stop a pair of Russian spies who make Boris and Natasha look like James Bond and Pussy Galore.Said agents have the formula for a product that evaporates petroleum so that everyone will have to buy oil from Russia. When Bobs CIA colleagues (George Lopez and Billy Ray Cyrus) intercept the formula and e-mail it to him Ian hacks into Bobs computer and downloads the file and the cartoony Russians go after Bob and the kids.The plot may be forgettable but the execution is frantic and funny. The Spy Next Door is a movie that will bring smiles to kids - and their grandparents.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Spy Next Door 1/2 (out of four)Stars Jackie Chan Amber Valletta Madeline Carroll Billy Ray Cyrus George Lopez Will ShadleyDirector Brian LevantDistributor LionsgateRating PG for sequences of action violence and some mild rude humorRunning time 1 hour 32 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The stunts are a mild highlight in Jackie Chans ultra-predictable family comedy The Spy Next Door. But Chans traditional gag reel that rolls with the final credits offers the most entertainment. Add a few more outtakes and you have a better movie than the silly one that came before. Chans linguistic goofs prompt a frustrated ""I hate English"" making for the biggest laugh in a movie that feels like a lackluster hybrid of The Pacifier Kindergarten Cop Daddy Day Care and Agent Cody Banks. INTERVIEW Spy co-star Amber Valletta is wearing her new stardom quite well VIDEO Watch the trailer Chans charm is evident particularly with his youthful co-stars and he tries gamely to maintain a playful spirit. But the story is a succession of familiar unimaginative scenes strung into a misfire of a movie. He plays Bob Ho a CIA superspy posing as a pen salesman. Ready to give up the espionage game he takes up residence in a quiet suburb and falls for his divorced neighbor Gillian (Amber Valletta). Shes drawn to him for his dependability the same trait that makes her kids think hes a bore. Of course hes determined to win them over. ""Ive brought down dictators"" he tells his colleagues (Billy Ray Cyrus and George Lopez). ""How tough can three kids be?"" Perhaps not as tough as winning over an audience. Bob is asked to do one last job a vague mission that involves Russian terrorists who sound like Boris and Natasha gaining control of the worlds oil supply. But when Gillian has to suddenly leave town Bob offers to babysit. Gillians tech-savvy pre-pubescent son Ian (Will Shadley) accidentally downloads a secret file from Bobs computer. Suddenly the Russians are coming. And theyre so bad they take candy away from small children. Bob is forced to juggle the roles of superspy and wannabe super-stepdad. But even Bobs arsenal of gadgets is only marginally interesting. More impressive are his agile jumping and climbing and the lightning-fast reflexes needed to fight off bad guys. But the 55-year-old Chans still-noteworthy talents in fight sequences are sluggishly choreographed. Chan has more chemistry with the kids than with Valletta but the story is so insipid that its likely to only sadden fans of the martial-arts icon and offer little enjoyment to its young audience.

By KARA NESVIG Special to the Star Tribune January 14 2010 -- 523pm  Star Tribune Jackie Chan (as Bob Ho) and Alina Foley (as Nora) star in THE SPY NEXT DOOR. Photo credit Colleen Hayes/Lionsgate Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Jackie Chan he of lightning-fast reflexes the action star of all action stars ... romantic lead? Nuh-uh no way. Jackie Chans not supposed to be wining and dining his lady friend and talking about marriage. Hes supposed to be kicking butt Like it or not Chan is getting older (hell be 56 in April) and perhaps those new wrinkles have him considering his career options for when he can no longer throw a punch. So hes taken a cue from fellow action heroes like Vin Diesel (think ""The Pacifier"") and signed on for a family film -- the lackluster so-corny-its-painful ""The Spy Next Door."" Whats more difficult busting Russian villains or endearing your girlfriends three rambunctious kids to you? For retired spy Bob Ho its clearly the latter. When Gillian (Amber Valetta) goes out of town Bob volunteers to play Mr. Mom. He can save the world from the Russians who are scheming to take over the oil industry in a ridiculous subplot involving a thousand silly stereotypes but he cant make oatmeal. ""The Spy Next Door"" is so hokey that I couldnt help but wonder if I was watching a campy sendup. It opens with ""Secret Agent Man"" for gods sake Everyone from Chan to supporting spy Billy Ray Cyrus to the big bad Russians seems to be reading their terrible lines from somewhere just off camera. The dialogue particularly Cyrus cringeworthy Kentucky-fried idioms is stilted colorless and boring even by kids movie standards. Every Hallmark-wholesome ""lesson"" crammed into the movie particularly those about the idea of family just makes you squirm. Although Chan is no stranger to comedy its clear that hes grasping at straws with this pallid cornball. Hes the only one besides Will Shadley as Gillians dorky son Ian who really visibly tries to make ""The Spy Next Door"" less of a disaster. But pitting a big strong man against wily sugar-fueled children is a plot line thats been done to death and ""The Spy"" does nothing to revitalize it.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The Spy Next Door may be a Z-movie rip-off of ""The Pacifier which was a B-movie rip-off of ""Kindergarten Cop which wasnt a grade-A idea to start with but at the new movies center is a notion thats charmingly if not dementedly democratic That a nerdy businessman/undercover super-agent played by action star Jackie Chan could build a loving sustainable relationship with the suburban single mom next door played by supermodel Amber Valletta.Only in America folks and possibly only in the movies but this one doesnt bat an eye.Otherwise the films so formulaic your 6-year-old will be ticking off the plot points as they lope by. ""Spy Next Door manages to be likable though because Chan is likable even when hes slumming in undercooked family fodder. His character Bob Ho is retiring from the CIA after putting sneering Russian baddie Poldark (Magnus Scheving) behind bars one last time and all he wants to do is propose to Gillian (Valletta) and win over her three children.Do I have to spell out what happens? Gillian is called away for a week (sick relative) and Bob takes over the parenting of sullen teen Farren (Madeline Carroll) precocious tweener Ian (Will Shadley) and cutesy-poo Nora (Alina Foley). Burnt toast clogged toilets and life lessons ensue and eventually the two halves of Bobs life come crashing together.Carroll makes a believably obnoxious 13-year-old in this context and Katherine Boecher gets a few laughs as Poldarks sidekick - shes doing Natasha Fatale from the old ""Rocky and Bullwinkle show and good for her. Otherwise Chans the only reason to be here turning his fight scenes into the usual slapstick ballets with bicycles ladders and the like.At 55 though the star is relying increasingly on wires and stunt doubles and sharp-eyed viewers will easily spot where. ""The Spy Next Door opens with a montage of Bobs previous exploits that are actually clips from earlier Chan movies and if you really want to remind yourself what the mans capable of theres always ""Police Story (1985) and ""Drunken Master II (1994) among oh 70 or 80 others. Heck even the ""Rush Hour movies are Bergman next to this.The most depressing part about ""The Spy Next Door is the revelation that the Central Intelligence Agency works out of a rundown office complex in Albuquerque and is headed up by the likes of Billy Ray Cyrus and George ""Most Intensely Annoying Man in Show Biz Lopez.

Comments click to enlarge The Spy Next Door Free Rated PG  92 minutes  2010 In middle age Jackie Chan cant keep coasting on boyish charm as evidenced by this dreadful family comedy that does him no favors with its opening title sequence a montage of action clips recalling earlier work where he performed most of his own complicated stunts and was genuinely funny as well. Here he plays an ace spy eager to retire and marry his neighbor (Amber Valletta) a single mom when some Russian terrorists with accents thicker than Boris and Natashas threaten the global oil market. Pressed back into action Chan simultaneously minds his sweethearts hostile three kids the younger of whom are played by two of the worst child actors in decades. The fight sequences (with obvious doubles) are anemic and Chans traditional outtakes over the closing credits wear pitifully thin. Brian Levant (Beethoven) directed.

Jackie Chan game as ever stars as Bob Ho an undercover CIA agent from China posing as a sweater-vested pen importer who offers to mind the three kids (roughly 13 nine and four) of his Albuquerque next-door-neighbor sweetheart Gillian (Amber Valletta) while shes away in Denver. When not preparing breakfast or shuttling his obnoxious new charges to school Bob must also face Russian baddies hatching a petroleum plot George Lopez as a mole and most alarmingly CIA colleague Billy Ray Cyruss bizarre shellacked middle-parted shag. Still immensely affable and eager the aging action hero (Chan has two stunt doubles) seems not to mind the humiliation of sharing most of the movie with his exhaustingly hammy half-pint co-stars or the unnecessary ESL cruelty After apologizing to Cyruss character for suspecting him in the plot Bob is told ""Dont worry about it buddy; chalk it up to the language barrier.""

Its a sad day for Jackie Chan fans when the action-comedy star is reduced to a vehicle as lame as ""The Spy Next Door."" As an undercover CIA agent ill-equipped to babysit his girlfriends three kids Chan struggles gamely to charm but the pics cartoonish jokes and misfired gags are likely to elicit more eye rolls than laughs. That said little ones enticed by the trailer and devoted Chan fans may join forces to generate a decent opening weekend followed by a sharp drop-off once this ""Spys"" cover is blown. Chan plays Bob Ho a mild-mannered pen salesman by day who moonlights as an international spy. Hes just the kind of simple trusting guy his neighbor Gillian (Amber Valletta) wants in her life but her three kids find him irredeemably boring. When Gillian is summoned out of town to care for a sick parent Bob sees an opportunity persuading her to leave him in charge of her brood disaffected teenage daughter Farren (Madeline Carroll) nerdy prepubescent Ian (Will Shadley) and adorable 4-year-old Nora (Alina Foley). A host of mini-crises ensue (a disastrous attempt to cook ends with smoke alarms blaring) all designed to spotlight Bobs incompetence on the domestic front. Only when Bob pulls out his spy gear installing closed-circuit cameras and kiddie LoJacks -- parents take note -- do things start to turn around. At the same time theres also an international incident involving a sartorially challenged Russian villain Poldark (Magnus Scheving) and a top-secret formula for bacteria-eating goop. Somehow young Ian has intercepted and downloaded the formula on his iPod a fact that immediately and inexplicably becomes known to the Russians so its not long before Poldark and his cronies come after Bob and the kids. Final reel involves a blow-out fight that packs plenty of stunt choreography physical humor and sight gags timed to coincide with Halloween. Thematically the pic borrows a thing or two from ""The Pacifier"" the 2005 comedy in which Vin Diesel was the undercover agent left in charge of five kids. ""Spys"" most effective sequences involve Bobs attempts to bond with the kids in particular little Nora which is understandable given helmer Brian Levants track record with family comedies (""Beethoven"" ""Jingle All the Way""). As for Chan hes far more persuasive as a comic charmer than as a romantic lead; he has much better chemistry with Carroll Shadley and Foley than he does with Valletta. Now 55 Chan doesnt have quite the loose-limbed elasticity of his glory days and though he may still perform some of his own stunts theres a sense in ""The Spy Next Door"" of a star struggling to find a foothold. Its a feeling underscored by David Newmans music which strains toward the kind of cutesy exaggerated playfulness that ought to have naturally emanated from the screen. As usual with Chan movies the gag reel is not to be missed. The Spy Next DoorProductionA Lionsgate release of a Relativity Media production. Produced by Robert Simonds.
