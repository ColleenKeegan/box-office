Mary (Jennifer Lopez) may preside coolly over armies of underlings in the production of lavish bridal events but shes really a home loving little woman devoted to her widowed Italian papa. And when she does meet her Prince Charming (Matthew McConaughey) he turns out to be the right down to earth guy engaged to the wrong upper class doll (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras at ease with playing tawny pouty types) a high maintenance daddys girl whose lucrative wedding account Mary has just landed. This dogged attachment to a romanticized social conservatism may fit our current political climate and the retro fantasies of teenage girls but it undermines the occasional charms of such a graph plotted romantic comedy which suffers particularly in inevitable comparison with ""My Best Friends Wedding."" Where Julia Roberts turned the world on with her huggability Lopezs vibe is that of someone afraid to get mussed. And where Rupert Everett was divine as a sidekick McConaughey is mortally ordinary as a main dish who spends most of his time smiling like a party guest. For diversion look to Fred Willard capering as a ballroom dance instructor and Joanna Gleason enjoying her role as a tippling mother of the bride Both veterans make their own fun at this perfunctory catered affair.

"Wedding Planner The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wedding-planner-the ) Wedding Planner The (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Five minutes into The Wedding Planner I suspected the film was in trouble. Ten minutes later I knew it was in trouble. Theres only one thing that can sink a movie so fast - bad writing. Even excruciating acting takes longer. Romantic comedies shouldnt be difficult to make since all but the very best of them follow a tried-and-true formula. All that is required is to get a pair of likable attractive leads and plop them down in the midst of a narrative that allows them to generate some romantic friction before being split apart by complications then brought back together at the end. Yet despite having a clear roadmap to use for navigation director Adam Shankman and his co-conspirators screenwriters Pamela Falk amp; Michael Ellis manage to screw things up. The end result is occasionally so inept and embarrassing that its almost physically painful to sit through. On the surface the selection of actress/singer Jennifer Lopez and one-time heartthrob Matthew McConaughey seems to be good casting. In the past both have had some success with romantic pairings (Lopez opposite George Clooney in the steamy thriller Out of Sight and McConaughey opposite Jenna Elfman in EdTV) so its reasonable to expect them to strike a few sparks. Unfortunately although Lopez is competent McConaughey looks lost. A city slicker with two sticks would have a better chance of generating heat than these two. The chemistry so crucial to the success of any screen romance is absent. But the central flaw isnt the actors or even the films generic premise - its the script. The Wedding Planner is a perfect example of what happens when the appeal of the two leads cannot overcome the obstacle presented by an irredeemably stupid screenplay. Mary Fiore (Lopez) is one of the best wedding planners in the state of California. Whenever anyone needs to arrange a lavish wedding they come to her. Despite her profession however she leads an unromantic life using the motto ""those who cant wed plan"". Things change for her one afternoon when she is saved from being stuck by a runaway garbage dumpster by a handsome doctor named Steve Edison (McConaughey). The two spend a romantic evening together and Mary thinks she may have found Mr. Right - until Steve turns out to be the fiancA(c) of her latest client Fran Donolly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras). But as the planning of the wedding becomes more involved Mary and Steves attraction represents a growing impediment. When I watch a romantic comedy I do not demand a great deal in the way of originality or inventiveness. This is after all a highly derivative genre in which the unexpected is often frowned upon. Romantic tension not narrative tension should be the directors goal. However I do require that the primary characteristics of the characters not be evidence of frontal lobotomies. Throughout The Wedding Planner people consistently do and say stupid things. Its an epidemic and no one is spared the ruthless butchering of the screenwriters witless pens. So Jennifer Lopez gets to crawl around on her knees to avoid an old flame and Matthew McConaughey if offered the opportunity to see what its like to have a statues stone genitals crazy glued to his hand. Can comedy get any funnier than that? Meanwhile the dialogue features more platitudes than can be found in a rack of Hallmark greeting cards. When characters are this dumb its impossible to care about their fates; consequently we have no investment in Mary and Steves eventual and inevitable union. Typically no matter how uninspired a romantic comedy may be it has the capacity to generate a moments bliss when the two lovers finally set aside their differences and come together. Not here though. The Wedding Planner cant even offer such a basic payoff and that makes the chore of watching it completely thankless. Even the superficial pleasure of gazing at Lopez and McConaughey cant justify this films existence.

Starring Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Either the people behind the new Jennifer Lopez romantic comedy are very smart or very dumb. Your call. The cozy and comfortable ""Wedding Planner"" manages to do the impossible It makes Lopez bland. As a proper and tightly wrapped professional wedding planner she is buttoned up in tasteful suits albeit Armanis and even has a twist of pearls in a choker. Having the ""Love Dont Cost a Thing"" Lopez play prim could prove to be a very shrewd strategy however. This comedy of mismatched partners may be predictable but at least Lopez isnt. She also tops what must be man for man and woman for woman the most downright gorgeous cast out there right now. It includes the tawny Matthew McConaughey Bridgette Wilson-Sampras who is a sculptured blonde and Calvin Klein model Justin Chambers. If PGamp;E had any brains it would harness all this onscreen wattage and the power crisis would be over. Too bad the charisma clambake doesnt come with more spice. The material cries out for screwball comedy and this cast could certainly bring it off. Too often however ""The Wedding Planner"" settles for something like whimsy or at least a stab at it. Too often it comes up with sappiness where it needs sass. Its a trade-off. Both McConaughey as a bridegroom-to-be with a wandering eye and Chambers as a guileless Latin lover make declarations of adoration to Lopez that are going to melt some hearts in the audience. Lopez is San Francisco wedding planner Mary Fiore a single-minded career woman who hasnt had a date in two years if you can buy that and self- contented eats dinner from a tray alone in front of the TV set. The nothing-if-not-competent Fiore could make an efficiency expert look like a slacker. She can psych up the bride coordinate command of the ceremony from her headset track down the F.O.B. (father of the bride) and provide emergency touch-ups from a kit beneath her suit jacket. Golden boy McConaughey is a pediatrician who doesnt let his imminent marriage stop a serious flirtation with Fiore. Bride-to-be Wilson-Sampras is supposed to be a high- powered San Francisco dot-com executive but not much is made of that. She obviously is McConaugheys intended Judging by their strong jawlines and matching sets of gleaming teeth they are dentally destined for each other. Chambers plays an Italian immigrant a ghost from Fiores Sicilian childhood who barely has a chance to walk through the door before announcing he will marry her. While ""The Wedding Planner"" comes uncomfortably close to a Barbie-doll fantasy the movie has its moments. Lopez and McConaughey keep up a running conversation during a tango lesson that shows director Adam Shankmans roots as a choreographer. Lopez of course can move and she has a nice little sequence where she alternately rushes and recovers her sangfroid during a wedding emergency. Lopez and McConaugheys banter over a broken-off chunk of a classic male nude statue is almost as airy as it needs to be. Ever since Steven Soderberghs ""Out of Sight"" with George Clooney theres been no doubt of Lopezs screen poise or acting chops. The only question here is whether she is taking a serious plunge into comedy which would certainly be a good idea or just capitalizing on the moment with the simultaneous premiere of her new album and steamy music video. If she is going into comedy in a big way next time she might find one with more bite -- it would be good for her and for her fans too. I guess San Francisco is stuck as far as the Hollywood mentality is concerned as the site for gloppy romanticism. Most of the locales in ""The Wedding Planner"" on Nob and Russian hills are predictable but the music concourse at Golden Gate Park is turned into the site of an outdoor wedding and the park is also used to show classic movies outdoors at night which is a pretty neat idea when you stop to think about it.

USATODAY.com - The Wedding Planner falters at the altar Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 01/26/2001 - Updated 0922 AM ET The Wedding Planner falters at the altar By Mike Clark USA TODAY Jennifer Lopez works hard to squeeze some fun out of The Wedding Planner but she lacks the knack of her old pal the anaconda with whom she once starred in a far funnier Sony release. Dont buy a ticket for this one even if the theater is having a fire sale on Raisinets. Read more Stories J. Lo projects voice of soulful woman Photo Gallery Jennifer Lopez Quiz Play guess who? Audio Love Dont Cost A Thing As the title character Lopez is so obsessed with her job that we see her recite a wedding reception toast into the earpiece of the guy delivering it. So its a blow to her sense of professionalism when she falls for her key clients groom (Matthew McConaughey). The Wedding Planner out of four Stars Jennifer Lopez Matthew McConaughey Bridgette Wilson-Sam- pras Justin Chambers Judy Greer Alex Rocco Fred Willard Director Adam Shankman Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG-13 for language and some sexual humor Well why not? Hes a doctor he can tango and he has plenty of something McConaughey didnt have at the Golden Globes wavy hair. Hes also engaged to a woman (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) whos going to be trouble. Shes rich blond beautiful immensely driven and she once ran (in an unconvincing script aside) a bookie operation out of her college sorority. Lopez and McConaughey are made for each other and we know it. But the movie doesnt -- at least immediately. If it did we could be spared a lot of agony and go home after 25 minutes -- following this farces reasonably promising beginning. Instead the story introduces someone wholl remain one of the movie years most impossible characters Lopezs childhood acquaintance from Italy (Justin Chambers) who with her fathers encouragement wants to marry her. Of course she is enormously successful while he doesnt show much evidence of being employed or employable. He also appears to have popped too many of Roberto Benignis effusive pills. Salvaging the movie some is McConaughey who hasnt been this loose since cutting up on screen in his pre-stardom days for director Richard Linklater in the terrific Dazed and Confused. In fact much of the cast brings misplaced energy to a lost cause that thinks rowdiness can compensate for a story that just plain doesnt make sense. The whole thing is like being at a party where everyone else is reveling and you cant figure out why they all think the drunk guy in the hula skirt is so funny. Despite the attempted festive atmosphere too many dead spots leave time to think and pose questions. Why is it for instance that Lopez is playing an Italian and the real Italian playing her father (Alex Rocco) seems to be having trouble with his Italian accent? Wedding seems to be designed to be Super Bowl counterprogramming though youll probably see more high-paid professionals fumbling here than on the field.

(Sony Pictures) ""The Wedding Planner"" is one of the first big studio releases of the post-Clinton era but it feels like a pure Clintonian artifact. It seems written and directed by a savvy Washington PR firm Its mostly spin in which people do terrible things to other people but its never their fault and they never have to face any consequences. Jennifer Lopez plays Mary a highly talented wedding planner whom the movie seems to admire profusely as it introduces her talking a terrified bride through a severe case of nerves. That characterizes Mary as a caring feeling compassionate woman; only later do we learn that her pep talk was shtick for such situations. It soon develops that this woman who supervises weddings two or three at a time with a headset mike over a video setup goes home to an empty apartment where she nukes gourmet takeout while roasting in tube glare. Quel irony A marriage professional with no love life at all However after snagging the particularly big Donolly wedding (and using it to extort her boss into giving her a partnership in the firm which the movie seems to think just fine) she cute-meets a handsome fella Dr. Steve whos even a pediatrician the No. 2 chick career preference (after architect for some reason). A spunky colleague (played by spunky Judy Greer the movies best thing) maneuvers the two into a date and its like the moment when Maria and Tony run into each other at the dance in ""West Side Story."" All right so Dr. Steve is only a doctor for about three minutes and never again mentions his medical practice and so hes played by Matthew McConaughey the worlds most repulsive narcissist. I cannot explain his being cast except to say that possibly someone somewhere thinks this fellow is attractive even if no life form Ive ever encountered does including my kidnappers from another galaxy. In fact they wanted to destroy Earth because of him but I talked them out of it. Well you can see where this picture is going. It turns out that Dr. Steve is the affianced of the beautiful plastic mannequin Fran Donolly (played by the beautiful plastic mannequin Bridgette Wilson); Mary the noble is actually tempted to plot against poor dim Fran. The film might have succeeded if it had given itself over to that dark side; it didnt work for ""My Best Friends Wedding"" but think what cosmopolitan cynics like Ernst Lubitsch or Billy Wilder might have done with such a premise. Theres even some evidence that such a path was considered. Quite recent Web sites list among the featured players that fast-talking ever-conniving Kevin Pollak - a sure sign that mischief was afoot - but hes nowhere to be seen in the finished product. Instead the nonentity director Adam Shankman steers the movie relentlessly toward sugary romantic fantasy. Its as if the tone is at war with the content. Bright and bubbly it endlessly chronicles bad behavior spun toward the positive. Dr. Steve for example is never judged for cheating on Fran by going out with Mary and he never even has to fess up. Not even Jesse Jackson got off that easy. Twice brides and grooms are dumped at the altar but the movie labors to convince you that its not the fault of the dumpers who are somehow portrayed as victims and that it was in everybodys best interest. A father whose 600000 wedding investment is trashed doesnt even get any screen time to lament his fate. Worst of all Mary continues in a professional situation that is clearly unethical and doomed to fail yet the movie insists shes some kind of heroine. When she flees a professional responsibility leaving a clearly incompetent assistant in charge thats offered as still more evidence of the purity of her heart. Lopez is okay and the movies tone is at least a refreshing change and presumable career-lube after her last movie that descent into slime called ""The Cell."" McConaughey is McConaughey. Poor Bridgette Wilson with that almost immobile but beautifully designed face she seems destined always to play the blond WASP idiot-bitch; if she has any talent shell never show it in roles like this but then whos going to cast her as Medea?""The Wedding Planner"" (105 minutes) is rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo but has no nudity.

(Sony Pictures) Dont even begin to think of ""The Wedding Planner"" as a good movie. But if youre in the Jennifer Lopez appreciation business - and I understand there are many of you - this energetically plotted romance is one way to check out her various assets. The best asset of all is her likability. As a control freak who plans weddings with the professional mastery of a Steven Spielberg shes a charming presence. Matthew McConaugheys her squeeze-in-the-making buffed up like most male actors these days and doing his adorable Texan thang. But ""The Wedding Planner"" is definitely Jennifers parade. Shes Mary Fiore a vibrant single woman who makes impossible extravagant weddings work like a dream whether shes consoling the bride sobering up the nervous father or issuing sharp commands by walkie-talkie. This is her world. She owns it. But heres the twist in a formulaic nutshell Shes ensuring everyones romantic future but her own. Thats when Mary bumps into Mr. Might Be Right (McConaughey) a good-looking pediatrician with a southern twang and a great big smile. Actually Mr. Might who calls himself Steve bumps into her. Get this An errant car nudges a sidewalk dumpster that starts to roll down the sloped road. This is San Francisco so everythings a slope. (Did they film here just to make this scene work?) Mary it just so happens gets a heel stuck in a manhole cover - right in the path of the speeding dumpster. But she wont take her foot out of the shoe because well she really doesnt want to lose a great shoe. At the last possible minute Steve takes an honorable dive and saves the day - and her shoe. Romantic fireworks explode of course. But as Mary seems bound for beautiful bliss with Steve she runs into a little complication - involving Steve. Without giving too much away hes suddenly out of the picture and Marys going to have to keep a stiff upper lip and work hard at her next project which involves a particularly lucrative wedding featuring bride-to-be Fran Donolly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras). Mary has another big problem. Her Italian father (Alex Rocco) has set her up with Massimo (Justin Chambers playing cute and Italian) a tenacious suitor and childhood friend from the Old Country who remembers Mary when she was young and naked. As you might have guessed from the dumpster scene alone the plot to ""The Wedding Planner"" is convoluted. Youll spend way too much time sitting through those unnecessarily detailed twists and turns and youll have to spend less-than-hilarious time with Marys supposedly wacky underling Penny (Judy Greer). I suggest you RSVP in the negative to this ""Wedding"" invitation unless you consider yourself a friend of the obvious bride to be Ms. Lopez. But even then youll have to focus on her presence rather than the silly ceremony around her. ""The Wedding Planner"" (PG-13 104 minutes) - Contains strong language sexual situations and sexual humor.

This tale of mismatched lovebirds begins with considerable charm but eventually loses its winning ways with an excess of ridiculous elements. Nevertheless Jennifer Lopezs fan base will pour out for opening-week reception. ""The Wedding Planner"" is an attractive bridesmaid but hardly a gorgeous bride among romantic comedies. Displaying early signs that it aspires to revive the urbane elegance of Ernst Lubitsch and the snap-crackle-pop dialogue of Howard Hawks this tale of mismatched lovebirds begins with considerable charm but eventually loses its winning ways with an excess of ridiculous elements. In this way pic by tyro helmer Adam Shankman is not unlike a wedding spoiled by too much of everything when some scaling back would have sent the crowd home happy. Nevertheless Jennifer Lopezs fan base will pour out for opening-week reception with steady numbers to follow in an early February honeymoon. Though its disheartening to witness Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis script fall short of its promise as a sophisticated romancer -- an increasingly rare animal in Hollywood -- this comedy is good news for co-stars Lopez and Matthew McConaughey. Taking a sharp left turn from her unconvincing dramatics in ""The Cell"" Lopez is far more comfortable in this classy San Francisco setting displaying a knack for playing both a control freak who knows all one can know about nuptials and a woman falling nutty in love. McConaughey has never been sexier or more charming generating a warmth that seems much more his metier than his various unsatisfying action characters. Early scenes show that Mary Fiore (Lopez) knew what she wanted to be when she grew up Whether its setting up Barbies rite of passage or a nervous brides in the present Mary is the wedding planner par excellence handling things with the authority of a TV director at the Olympics. Working under Geri (Kathy Najimy) who owns a successful San Francisco wedding-planning business Mary is easily the firms best handler and demands to become Geris partner if she lands the lucrative account of the wealthy high-tech business clan the Donollys whose strong-willed daughter Fran (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) is about to be married. Marys private life is a lonely affair. Dad Salvatore (Alex Rocco playing a first-generation Italian immigrant and almost tongue-tied by the accent) eyeballs Marys childhood mate Massimo (Justin Chambers) whom she disliked then and has no time for now. Like a clueless innocent bulldog Massimo is deaf to Marys signals and promptly announces that hes marrying her -- launching the movies increasingly dumb subplot. A freak accident involving her Gucci pumps lands Mary in the rescuing arms of Steve (McConaughey) a pediatrician with charm to burn. Marys goofy assistant Penny (Judy Greer) spots the appeal right away and not so craftily arranges a date for the two of them in Golden Gate Park where the pair end up dancing to an alfresco screening of ""Two Tickets to Broadway"" starring Tony Martin and Janet Leigh. As in true screwball tradition Mary turns around the next day to start prepping for Frans big day and finds that the bridegroom is none other than Dr. Steve. Vet choreographer Shankman struts his stuff staging a crackling tango dance number between the stars who step and swoop while arguing back and forth about Steves seeming deceit. Another well-cut exchange -- in which Penny convinces Mary to remain professional while Steves golfing buddy (Kevin Pollak in what seems like a larger role now scissored to a cameo) convinces him that this was a one-night loss of control -- suggests that this comedy is building toward something special. That sense soon dissolves though with storytelling that leaves no doubt where its headed and has an uncertain comic sensibility. The insistent presence of Massimo damages the movie beyond repair -- Marys bizarre inability to blow this guy off raises questions about her character -- and Frans ice-queen persona is so contrived that theres no question who will end up in whose arms when the dust settles. Theres a gap between the chemistry of the marquee players and their disappointing support with even the usually gifted comic Greer overplaying. Stuck in a rich-bitch role she could be typecast in for some time to come Wilson-Sampras is pure blond calculation and little more. Chambers aggressive Italo naif is fake from top to bottom while Fred Willard in an absurd bit as a flamboyant dance teacher bites into his brief role with total blissful conviction. Julio Macats widescreen lensing is pure class and Bob Ziembicki leads an inspired production design team. Add however Mervyn Warrens music to the growing tally of ruinous overwritten scores.
