We upright two-legged creatures regularly have to give way to the superior intelligence or endless fascination of a deer or a dog or a penguin. Its part of the bargain we draw them they make us look stupid. And so it is with Wall-E except this time we have only ourselves to blame. Pixar has drawn inspiration for this bold bleak and often very beautiful film from the worst approximations of the future were shaping for our planet.In Pixars previous film Ratatouille it was a sewer rat who brilliantly grabbed our attention and revolutionised French cuisine. For Wall-E humans again take a back seat and its a robot with a cube for a belly and binoculars for eyes whos bleeping for our love. When we do finally encounter humans - living on a self-sufficient spaceship waited on by robots sucking on straws - theyre fat sedentary greedy and unpleasant. Plus ca change from Cruella de Vil to our fellow folk in Happy Feet cartoons have always held a mirror up to our selfish instincts.This time its 2700 and weve polluted ourselves out of existence. The only humans left live a sterile bloated life high above earth where we decamp for the second more frenetic and less inspired half of the film. But everything that comes before is magical. The only animate object left in the lifeless rust-coloured dusty landscape of urban desolation that we used to call earth is one tireless mechanical waste-collector called Wall-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth Class). He lives in a cluttered container and spends his days buzzing about piling up junk to look like skyscrapers or Mayan temples and sucking up sun for his solar panels. His only company is a lonesome cockroach.So thats one robot a cockroach and a vision of earth gone to pot. This is a cartoon that offers an uncompromising imaginative angry portrait of the future. Its daring in its simplicity for the first 40 minutes we watch in wonder as Wall-E goes about his business in near silence; its the sharp intelligence of the detail always so painstakingly rendered that most amazes. At one point Wall-E finds an abandoned diamond ring in a jewellery box. What does he do with it? He throws away the ring and plays with the hinges of the container. Of course he does hinges should fascinate more than precious minerals. Shame on us for not realising that before.By rights Wall-E shouldnt be cute in the Bambi or Dumbo sense of the word hes battered and fading and the only noises he makes are computerised drawls not dissimilar to ETs limited lingo. But Wall-E is alluring and not because hes got big eyes or dangling eyelashes but because hes smart hard-working with a romantic side and is hopelessly addicted to watching clips of Michael Crawford and Barbra Streisand in Gene Kellys Hello Dolly on a video screen. Hes everything we should have been if we hadnt put all our energy into destroying the planet. But none of this is preachy or obvious. Environmental destruction is only the breathtaking backdrop to the film and its more the minimalism of Wall-Es existence that fascinates. By the time a sleeker feminine robot called Eve - who looks like an iPod shaped into a pepper-pot - arrives were craving her company in sympathy with our mechanised friend. Pixar has done it again. I wonder a little what kids will make of the long silence of the first half followed by the disorienting mania of the second but theres nothing here thats not wonderfully imagined and lovingly presented.

(Im getting tingly just thinking about it) and if along the way theres a message about corporate greed and consumption then why the hell not because hes Wall-E and hes in love but its not a massive political propaganda film it is as all Pixar films are for everyone. remember crying when Andy went to college? my Mum did because it was the same year I went away. and need I ask if you remember the opening montage of Up. Pixar gets the heart of all of us and Wall-E in my opinion does it the best. and to top it all off with the stunning cinematography you get from Pixar and you have the recipe for one of the greatest films ever made. its ET for a whole new generation.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 26 2016Kirsty ETastemakerFeaturedReally good movie with a lot of action underlying important messages and fun (eventually).. but it seems so sad perhaps a bit too emotional and meaningful for young kids?

Well done Pixar  The striking things about this film for me were; 1) The imagery of the Empty Earth / the first 40 minutes or so - this is pure sci-fi great to see someone elses impression of what that might look like (not unlike the recent ""I am Legend"" although apart from the imagery I found this to be a poor film). 2) Pixar are really taking a chance with their audience - the eco aware generation could have nightmares about us trashing the planet. Well this is what I would look like. As well as that Americans (and the peoples of other 1st world countries) DO have very sedantry lives - full of adverts time savers and short cuts. This film may wake its viewers up to the full consequences of that kind of lifestyle. As I said - Pixar taking a risk here. 3) The attachment WALL-E has to the imagery it constantly refers back too - the music and dancing of Michael Crawford in Hello Dolly. This is simply wonderful and opens up many interpretations for the viewer. Quite brilliant. 4) The ""love at first sight"" WALL-E has for Eva had me hooked immediately too - because this ""love"" is somehow lifted from the music and pictures from Hello Dolly. The music is a strong reference point. 5) The last 30 minutes or so are much more routine Pixar/Disney - complete with inevitable happy ending. This was less satisfying - but it had to happen  I viewed the film with my 5 year old son and he loved it. We adults also loved it. Outstanding and outstanding too because unlike Toy Story Incredibles Nemo Cars etc - WALL-E takes risks.

"Review Wall-E is a classic - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Wall-E is a classicStory Highlights ""Wall-E"" is best film of year so far says reviewer Tom Charity Pixar film concerns a lonely robot cleaning up a garbage-filled Earth Wall-E the robot pursues love with another robot Film largely empty of dialogue but full of grace and joy Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- The most consistent production unit in Hollywood just hit another home run. Wall-E ponders a Rubiks Cube in the Pixar film ""Wall-E."" Over the last decade Pixar has become a byword for quality combining cutting-edge digital animation with depth of character slapstick comedy and rich engrossing storytelling that appeals equally to kids and adults. ""Wall-E"" has all of that and more. Written and directed by Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo"") its Pixars most ambitious movie and an instant classic. Wall-E is a solar-powered garbage drone the last one still operating on an abandoned toxic planet that looks an awful lot like -- well is -- Earth. A rusty box sitting on caterpillar tracks with a retractable binocular-shaped head he compresses junk into building blocks and then piles them up into towers that are shadow-skyscrapers of waste in the ruins of an unidentified city. Electronic billboards still plug defunct products and bring us up to speed handily Having polluted the planet with more waste than it could handle globo-corporation Buy N Large evacuated its customers on a five-year space cruise (""The final fun-tier"" promises the president played by Fred Willard) leaving the robots to clean up the mess. Only their calculations were a little off. Its been 700 years and Wall-E is still at work. Watch the cast talk about the plucky robot >> The opening half-hour is a delectable demonstration of visual storytelling. Although his vocabulary is limited to a bare handful of words Wall-E we gather has developed more than a trace of consciousness. Hes a hoarder curious enough to collect unusual bric-a-brac a whisk an electric light bulb bubble wrap. His most treasured item is a VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly."" Dont Miss Toy Story studio keeps raising the bar In Depth Academy Awards Spotlight His systems are scrambled when he bumps into Eve a gleaming research pod from the mother ship whose sleek egg-like design and distinctive start-up chime must be a wink to Pixar (and Apple) boss Steve Jobs. At any rate Eve is the apple of Wall-Es eye. Hes so smitten hed follow her anywhere -- even outer space. Theres something special about Wall-E and his pursuit. Robots have been routinely humanized in sci-fi movies in ""Blade Runner"" ""A.I."" and ""Metropolis"" for example. And ""Wall-E"" also isnt alone in implying that human beings are becoming more mechanistic ourselves though the obese overgrown babies Stanton imagines reclining in hover chairs -- pampered and cocooned from birth -- is a more scathing caricature of consumer over-dependency than wed expect to find in a Hollywood family film. iReport.com Share your view on Wall-E Indeed Stantons most obvious touchstones are Stanley Kubricks 1968 film ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" (at one point he treats us to a parodic blast of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" to signal a small baby step for man thats also a huge leap for mankind) and Douglas Trumbulls 1972 eco-parable ""Silent Running"" philosophical sci-fi films made only four years apart at another point of environmental sensitivity. But the animating spirit here goes back much further to the sentimental reveries and delightful improvisatory dexterity of Charlie Chaplin. In ""Modern Times"" made more than 70 years ago Chaplin made play with the degrading effects of industrialized society. In ""Wall-E"" Stanton pitches us between a post-industrial wasteland embalmed in smog and the sterile artificial atmosphere of a giant floating life-support system. These arent attractive prospects but they are transformed by the little lovelorn robot a lonely soul who seeks companionship anywhere he can get it ... in a cockroach an old movie and a trigger-happy search robot. ""Wall-E"" isnt a perfect movie; some business involving a team of rogue robots is unduly scrappy. But mostly this is a film filled with remarkable moments a pas de deux in front of the Milky Way (with Wall-E propelled by a fire extinguisher) Eves maternal glow as she carries out her primary directive the fleeting moment when first-time space traveler Wall-E turns back sees the Earth and tries to share his joy in the discovery. Grace beauty joy laughter and love. A wonderful combination for any movie. ""Wall-E"" is easily the best film of the year so far. ""Wall-E"" is rated G and has a running time of 97 minutes.

By David Denby Heath Ledger and Christian Bale in Christopher Nolans new Batman movie.   Credit FRANK STOCKTON In the new Batman film ""The Dark Knight"" many things go boom. Cars explode jails and hospitals are blown up bombs are put in peoples mouths and sewn into their stomachs. Theres a chase scene in which cars pile up and climb over other cars and a truck gets lassoed by Batman (his one neat trick) and tumbles through the air like a diver doing a back flip. Men crash through windows of glass-walled office buildings and there are many fights that employ the devastating martial-arts system known as the Keysi Fighting Method. Christian Bale who plays Bruce Wayne (and Batman) spent months training under the masters of the ferocious and delicate K.F.M. Unfortunately I cant tell you a thing about it because the combat is photographed close up in semidarkness and cut at the speed of a fifteen-second commercial. Instead of enjoying the formalized beauty of a fighting discipline we see a lot of flailing movement and bodies hitting the floor like grain sacks. All this ruckus is accompanied by pounding thuds on the soundtrack with two veteran Hollywood composers (Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard) providing additional bass-heavy stomps in every scene even when nothing is going on. At times the movie sounds like two excited mattresses making love in an echo chamber. In brief Warner Bros. has continued to drain the poetry fantasy and comedy out of Tim Burtons original conception for ""Batman"" (1989) completing the job of coarsening the material into hyperviolent summer action spectacle. Yet ""The Dark Knight"" is hardly routine--it has a kicky sadism in scene after scene which keeps you on edge and sends you out onto the street with post-movie stress disorder. And it has one startling and artful element the sinister and frightening performance of the late Heath Ledger as the psychopathic murderer the Joker. That part of the movie is upsetting to watch and in retrospect both painful and stirring to think about. ""The Dark Knight"" which was directed by Christopher Nolan (who also made ""Batman Begins"") and written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan is devoted to perversity. Bruce Wayne attempting to bring order to Gotham City has instead provoked the thugs. The mob is running rampant and theyve infiltrated the police department. The Joker who doesnt care for money and wants only the power to sow chaos intimidates everyone including the gangsters. Wayne and the noble Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) decide to get behind the new D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and set him up as Gothams crime-fighting hero. Batman even thinks of retiring. But the Joker wont let him; he needs him as someone to play with. An anarchist by philosophy the Joker uses terrorist methods (bombs bombs bombs) and he has an enormous advantage over the principled Batman--hes ruthless. So the Joker taunts and giggles and Batman can only extend his wings. Its a workable dramatic conflict but only half the team can act it. Christian Bale has been effective in some films but hes a placid Bruce Wayne a swank gent in Armani suits with every hair in place. Hes more urgent as Batman but he delivers all his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection. Its a dogged but uninteresting performance upstaged by the great Ledger who shambles and slides into a room bending his knees and twisting his neck and suddenly surging into someones face like a deep-sea creature coming up for air. Ledger has a fright wig of ragged hair; thick running gobs of white makeup; scarlet lips; and dark-shadowed eyes. Hes part freaky clown part Alice Cooper the morning after and all actor. Hes mesmerizing in every scene. His voice is not sludgy and slow as it was in ""Brokeback Mountain."" Its a little higher and faster but with odd devastating pauses and saturnine shades of mockery. At times I was reminded of Marlon Brando at his most feline and insinuating. When Ledger wields a knife he is thoroughly terrifying (do not despite the PG-13 rating bring the children) and as youre watching him you cant help wondering--in a response that admittedly lies outside film criticism--how badly he messed himself up in order to play the role this way. His performance is a heroic unsettling final act this young actor looked into the abyss. Parts of ""The Dark Knight"" were shot with IMAX cameras and if you see the movie on one of those enormously tall screens you will feel as Batman swoops down from a building at night as if you were falling into a canyon. Its a giddy thrill--bring Dramamine. The rest of the movie photographed by Wally Pfister is sharp and clear with shots of Gotham (i.e. Chicago) in glistening night splendor and plentiful use of vast modernist interiors with slab floors. Yet I cant rate ""The Dark Knight"" as an outstanding piece of craftsmanship. ""Batman Begins"" was grim and methodical and this movie is grim and jammed together. The narrative isnt shaped coherently to bring out contrasts and build toward a satisfying climax. ""The Dark Knight"" is constant climax; its always in a frenzy and it goes on forever. Nothing is prepared for and people show up and disappear without explanation; characters are eliminated with a casual nod. There are episodes that are expensively meaningless (a Hong Kong vignette for instance) while crucial scenes are truncated at their most interesting point--such as the moment in which the disfigured Joker confronts a newly disfigured Harvey Dent (a visual sick joke) and turns him into a vicious killer. The thunderous violence and the music jack the audience up. But all that screw-tightening tension isnt necessarily fun. ""The Dark Knight"" has been made in a time of terror but its not fighting terror; its embracing and unleashing it--while making sure with proper calculation to set up the next installment of the corporate franchise. Watching Pixars animated film ""WALL-E"" must be a humbling experience for other filmmakers because it demonstrates not just the number but the variety of ideas you need to make a terrific movie. ""WALL-E"" which was directed by Andrew Stanton and written by Stanton and John Reardon has the waggish adorableness and the tripping-and-falling roughhouse of other animated films. But its also a work of tragic nostalgia. In the ruins of a great American city WALL-E a robotic trash collector and compactor continues to go about his duties after the human presence has been blown away by billowing waves of noxious dust. Accompanied only by a cockroach WALL-E trolls among the detritus of the vanished culture; the junk items he finds become fetishes for him. He holds on to plastic forks hubcaps and Zippo lighters and throws away a diamond ring while keeping the felt box (he likes containers). He lives in a steel garbage dump that is at once home arcade archeological museum and church. Among his collection lies not a recording of ""Messiah"" or of Beethovens Ninth but a tape of the 1969 musical ""Hello Dolly"" a movie considered lumbering and out of date when it opened. And what he watches again and again is not the famous Louis Armstrong-Barbra Streisand duet but a wan little love song ""It Only Takes a Moment""--with skinny Michael Crawford holding Marianne McAndrews hand--and the routine dance production number ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes."" When a spaceship shows up and leaves behind a female robot named EVE he woos her with the determination of a man possessed by a lyrical impulse. A bad old movie keeps the human idea alive in two robots. The ironies move toward satire when the two travel to EVEs home a space station called the Axiom where it turns out the remaining humans have been living for seven hundred years in a totalitarian paradise run by a giant big-box-store company Buy N Large. The visual invention is both excruciatingly funny and haunting. Back on earth the disused skyscrapers look like Utah monuments worn away by time and weather. The interior of the Axiom is clean and bright in a style that might be called cruise-liner moderne with a serious touch of food-court classicism. Consumer capitalism having taken complete control of life decorates in pinks and blues--a soothing milieu for humans who are too fat to move on their own and who travel in comfortably bedded little hovercrafts in which screens constantly switched on stand in front of their faces. The robots on the Axiom include a fussy muttering little droid who scarfs up any contaminating substance (such as soil from Earth) and squadrons of square-shouldered helots who try to squash the slightest sign of free will. ""WALL-E"" blends two kinds of science fiction--the post-apocalyptic disaster scenario and the dystopian fantasy derived from Aldous Huxleys ""Brave New World"" in which people are controlled not by coercion but by pleasure. Apparently the movie has caused annoyance in some quarters because it criticizes the American way of life. This it does and with suavity and supreme good humor. ""WALL-E"" is a classic but it will never appeal to people who are happy with art only when it has as little bite as possible.

The trash piles up skyscraper-high. Across this wasteland rolling on ancient treads is the eponymous hero of ""WALLE"" a robotic trash compactor dutifully crushing the endless refuse into tidy squares saving the most intriguing of mans leftovers--a Rubiks cube a light bulb extra binoculars should he need replacement eyes--for his private collection which he stores in the shack he calls home. This lonely robot is the last working machine on the planet a synthetic Sisyphus programmed to repeat his unending task his only companion an indestructible cockroach--neither of whom it goes with out saying has much in the way of a vocabulary.A trash compactor a cockroach and a garbage dump? Twenty minutes without a word being spoken? What is this Beckett in CGI? No its Pixars newest boldest notion of mass-market family entertainment. Once again the Pixar wizards have pushed the animation envelope in unexpected directions and come up with a winner. Wondrously inventive funny and poignant ""WALLE"" is part sci-fi adventure part cautionary fable part satire and part love story which may be the best and most improbable part of all.WALLE (which stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) loses his metallic heart to EVE (an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) a sleek egg-shaped probe-droid sent to Earth to look for signs of vegetable life. Their budding romance on Earth comes to an abrupt halt when EVE fulfills her directive WALLE presents her with an actual living plant which she tucks inside herself to take back to the humans who have been circling in space for 700 years aboard the giant spacecraft Axiom. The love-struck robot hops aboard the rocketship determined to pursue her wherever it may lead. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Ill leave for you to discover what has become of humanity after 700 years of floating idly in space attended to by robots and bombarded with corporate advertising. Director Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo"") and the Pixar team have created a world so packed with witty visual detail--and filled with movie references that range from ""2001"" to ""Blade Runner"" to ""Manhattan""--that young kids may have a hard time keeping up with the plot. Its a movie that demands full attention and it may prove more popular with adults than children.""WALLE"" doesnt have a lot of dialogue but it has an amazing soundtrack starting with Thomas Newmans brilliantly eclectic score which hilariously incorporates ""2001""s ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" and ""Blue Danube Waltz"" as well as two Jerry Herman songs from ""Hello Dolly."" Its a musical number from this 60s musical which WALLE watches on video back at home that serves as his instruction manual for romantic courtship. Even more important is the contribution of Ben Burtt the sound and character-voice designer who manages to turn the bleeps and pings of WALLE and EVE into the touching language of love.As big a hit as ""Cars"" was I could never really get under the hood of those four-wheeled characters. They were the dullest members of the Pixar family. But when this trash compacter nudges his rusty forehead against EVEs smooth white metal brow youd have to be a machine for your heart not to melt.An extra Pixar treat is the cartoon ""Presto"" that preceeds it a slapstick marvel featuring a magician and the disgruntled rabbit he expects to pull out of his hat. The bunny it turns out has a few tricks up its own furry sleeve.

The new Pixar picture Wall-E is one for the ages a masterpiece to be savored before or after the end of the world -- assuming like the title character youre still around when all the humans have taken off and have access to an old video player. Wall-E (thats the name of the machine) is a trash compactor the last of his kind from an age in which cleaning up garbage was mankinds highest priority -- before people threw in the towel (and broom) and apparently (no spoilers here) rocketed away. Now this squat childlike robot with his pivoting goggle eyes resides in a metropolis surrounded by skyscrapers that turn out on closer inspection to be compressed trash bricks piled high into the soot-gray sky. The movie is a bit of a trash brick itself Director Andrew Stanton and his Pixar collaborators have taken cultural detritus -- bits and pieces from cherished film genres pop icons visionary sci-fi tropes half-remembered bric-a-brac from childhood -- and compacted it all into a sublime work of art. There were advance rumbles that Wall-E would be tough going for kids that its story is not just grim but its storytelling experimental. Ridiculous An outrage Although the images are frequently flabbergasting the narrative is as simple as Chaplin Keaton Jacques Tati even the Teletubbies Maybe the movie only seems experimental because its evenly paced and linear and doesnt call for viewers to do the perceptual equivalent of multitasking (which viewers these days seem to like). The story itself -- well that is a bit of a grown-up downer. Although theres plenty of silent-movie slapstick the apocalyptic context adds a hefty dose of melancholy. (We laugh when Wall-E finds a little box with a diamond ring then tosses the ring and keeps the box -- but the thought of the couple that left it behind is rather poignant.) Dust storms drive Wall-E into his lair where he endlessly rewatches clips from the film Hello Dolly -- particularly the opening number with Michael Crawford warbling about going to the city and kissing a girl. (""Theres no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes"") Its Wall-Es only link to a gay (in the 1890s sense) world of limitless horizons and conspicuous consumption -- and crowds of people. For companionship Wall-E is limited to a sort of roach (evolved) thats virtually indestructible. (Also indestructible are cream pastries he consumes that are clearly modeled on Twinkies -- a great punch line to all the jokes about the imperishability of that synthesized cakelike product.) From the beginning Pixar -- a beacon for the future of film technology -- explored themes of loss decay and the dark side of materialism. The old-fashioned toys of Toy Story were soulful repositories of childhood love rendered obsolete by newer and fancier models. Even Pixars most routinely plotted film Cars was steeped in the romance of old machines. Its as if those machines hold memories that humans forget -- beauties that have been overlooked with growing up in a fast-paced cyber-world. What a peculiar company this is forward- and backward-looking a technological Janus head. Here director Stanton (Finding Nemo) extends that theme to the ruination of the entire planet which he explicitly ties to an unchecked free-market embodied by a giant corporation that took over -- Buy n Large its called but think Wal-Mart. Its lulling calls to consumption help to soften and fatten the human race (you should see these blobs) and separate them from the natural world. The storms meanwhile conjure up the planets most catastrophic man-made environmental disaster -- the Dust Bowl born of greed for corn profits (sound familiar?) that left topsoil suddenly vulnerable to winds. What will the wing nuts and the Cato-institutionalized make of Wall-E which not only prophesies environmental horrors but targets overweening corporations? All it needs is a terrorist fist bump. Boycott those Pixar pinkos The first part of Wall-E has no talk -- apart from that ghastly Hello Dolly thing and Fred Willard on an old video as Buy n Larges ""global CEO."" Then a rocket descends accompanied by Thomas Newmans score which like the movie is a gloriously inspired melange -- Warner cartoons (Carl Stalling) sci-fi awe Shostakovich terror. What emerges from that ship is Eve a smooth white egglike robot with a head that floats above her unattached -- vaguely Japanese with violet cat eyes like a sprite out of Miyazaki. Wall-E is instantly smitten even though Eve blasts anything she deems a threat. (Its an edgy courtship.) Eves mission -- and where it leads her and Wall-E -- Ill let you discover for yourself. But humans of a sort are involved and there are rollicking chases and a tender love story. When a little-girl giggle comes out of Eve Wall-E suddenly seems like one of those movies where two lonely little kids discover each other and share wordless adventures. (Theres a rocketing space pas de deux between Wall-E and Eve in which the lyricism is positively transcendental.) Somehow these two machines -- these children -- have to reinfuse whats left of mankind with the joy of play. Their electronic coos and twitters recall Star Wars and E.T.; their only visual aid is a tiny plant that conjures up memories of the pathetic little twig tree in A Charlie Brown Christmas. At heart Wall-E spins a rather conventional and even conservative -- although youd never know it in this topsy-turvy political world -- parable. But the film never feels like blockbuster business as usual. Like in Finding Nemo (only more so) the sense of loss is too pervasive. Something precious is alive but hanging by a thread a twig a microscopic filament. And Pixar -- this ridiculously rich state-of-the-art computer colossus -- is using all its resources to show us what were losing.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News The new Pixar feature ""WALL-E"" is an environmental cautionary tale as well as a story of budding love between two robots. And for its first half-hour or so its possibly the most melancholy cartoon ever made Even the color palette of that early section a mosaic of brownish grays brushed with dusty sunlight speaks of loneliness and of desperate cheerfulness in the face of a blank future. In the second half ""WALL-E"" becomes less lyrical and more satirical although even then its bite is surprisingly sharp. But by the end ""WALL-E"" has turned into something else again a picture thats so adamant about ending on a feel-good note (or at least a feel-OK note) that it betrays the sad subtle beauty of those early scenes. It must be that director Andrew Stanton -- the man behind the enormously successful ""Finding Nemo"" -- didnt want to make too much of a downer Cant be sending all those tots home with the blues can we? But the picture feels weirdly and disappointingly disjointed something that starts out as poetry and ends as product. WALL-E is a sort of mobile trash compactor -- his name is an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class -- and hes the last robot left on a desolate crumbling Earth 800 years in the future. WALL-E has a squat yellow metal body and sturdy pincers for hands. He doesnt say much (the noises he does eventually make are provided by Ben Burtt). But his eyes two lenses perched atop a virtually nonexistent head like a set of binoculars suggest the all-too-human anxiety he suffers He has the perpetually worried look of the young Woody Allen. Although there are no humans left to avail themselves of his services (well find out where theyve gone later) WALL-E still dutifully goes about the business he was built to do scooping up scraps of trash and metal forming them into solid compact cubes and stacking them high Hes surrounded by faux skyscrapers made of these blocks reminders maybe of the great things men were capable of doing before they were undone by greed and hubris. Or maybe theyre just comforting artifacts for this lonely little robot mementos from a time when he was surrounded by life. As WALL-E roams this forlorn landscape doing his job simply because he has no idea what else to do he picks up small treasures bits and bobs that he thinks (if robots can think) might one day come in handy and brings them back to his lair The mishmash includes a Rubiks cube strings of Christmas lights. WALL-E has one friend -- an elegant-looking art-deco-style cockroach who communicates mostly by clicking and cocking his antennae -- but we can see he longs for something more. Is it possible hes been so well-programmed by humans that hes more human than human? Stashed in his cave is a talisman that WALL-E values more than anything else in his possession an object that he goes back to obsessively hoping to unlock his secrets. Its a scratchy videotape of ""Hello Dolly"" although only small portions of the tape appear to be functional. And so WALL-E spends his evenings trying to parse the secrets of human connection through musical numbers like ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" and ""It Only Takes a Moment."" Hes bewitched by these fragments of pop art For him theyre mysterious primers on what it means to dance or to hold someones hand. When the music kicks in its shaky and faint like a cue beamed in from a far-away galaxy a place where people used to understand the pleasure of one anothers company or even just the joy that could be found in a throwaway musical number. You Might Also Like Theres very little dialogue in the early part of WALL-E and that sections near-silence only enhances its aura of mournful obsessiveness Scraps of pop culture that are expendable to us (who ever even thinks about ""Hello Dolly"" anymore?) are precious to WALL-E and they begin to have even greater potential meaning when a lovely girl robot named Eve -- shaped like a sleek white bullet she resembles a cocktail shaker from a 70s bachelor pad -- comes to Earth on a mission of her own. Theres more to ""WALL-E"" than just a love story. There would have to be because as Pixar has gone about building a reputation for meticulous craftsmanship in animation its pictures have become more ambitious in their narrative and thematic scope as well. Sometimes the company has gone beyond fulfilling those ambitions as in the case of Brad Birds marvelous Pixar features ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille."" Other times its movies have seemed to be about nothing but ambition (as in the flashy but lifeless ""Cars""). ""WALL-E"" falls somewhere between those two poles. Its not as beautifully crafted a piece of work either visually or narratively as ""Ratatouille"" is. But it does have a soul and for a portion of the movie at least Stanton (who co-wrote the script with Jim Reardon; he and Pete Docter conceived the idea for the story) does take a surprisingly firm stance on the uselessness and unlikability of humankind. ""WALL-E"" shows us a future world in which humans -- fed largely on junk food -- have become so fat they look like old-fashioned rubber dollies bloated to obscene proportions. Theyre obese partly because theyre lazy Instead of walking theyve gotten used to coasting along on floating chaise lounges and robots cater to their every whim. Instead of talking to each other face-to-face they chat with their friends on computer screens that appear to be permanently affixed just a few inches from their faces -- even when their friends are sailing along right next to them. ""WALL-E"" also takes on corporate greed and political corruption The president of the multinational megacorporation thats largely responsible for the demise of humankind is also the president of the whole world and hes played by Fred Willard who appears as a hologram spreading false optimism and lies. But ""WALL-E"" ultimately backs away from both its romanticism and its bitterness; its ending feels like a tacked-on remnant of manufactured hope and goodwill. Theres plenty of antic action in the middle of ""WALL-E"" including a chase sequence involving a bunch of ""rogue robots."" But the action doesnt feel integral to the plot -- its more like a forced effort to make sure the kiddies dont get bored. Toward the end of ""WALL-E"" Stanton tries to circle back and recapture some of the wistful magic of the movies early scenes but the spell doesnt take. ""WALL-E"" gives us a hero who by culling through the masses of junk that we so casually throw away becomes a repository for human memories a living (though not breathing) creature who has more feeling than actual humans do. Then it shows us actual humans -- lazy fat brainless ones who have squandered and abused their free will -- and asks us to forgive their foibles. The gloss of preachiness that washes over ""WALL-E"" overwhelms the haunting delicate spirit of its first 30 minutes. This clearly isnt a movie made by a robot; the drag is that it ends up feeling so programmed. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

With the voices of Ben Burtt Elissa Knight and Jeff Garlin. Directed by Andrew Stanton. (G. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) What we have with ""WALL-E"" is 45 minutes of a masterpiece and another 50-odd minutes of dithering - there as a concession that you cant market a 45-minute movie. This means that the experience of ""WALL-E"" is a little different from what audiences will take away from it. In the moment its intermittently transcendent heartrending and beautiful ... and busy repetitious and boring. But in memory ""WALL-E"" should grow because the weaker parts will drop out of mind while the moments of sheer brilliance which are one-of-a-kind will gain in importance. Philosophically and emotionally this is probably the most profound animated film ever made or attempted. In terms of subject its not unlike the never-filmed screenplay that James Agee wrote for Charlie Chaplin in the 1950s in which the Little Tramp is the last survivor of a nuclear blast. Its a mark of the Pixar teams artistry which goes way beyond technical expertise that within minutes of meeting WALL-E a wordless trash-compacting robot we are persuaded to invest in him much of the feeling that wed attach to a Chaplin character. Think about that for a second. Think how amazing that is. In fact theyve hooked us before we even meet WALL-E. The movie opens with the song ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" (from ""Hello Dolly"") playing over pictures of outer space. The slight echo given to the song conveys that this is something from long ago the sonic equivalent of light emanating from a dead star. The song bespeaks a world of unclouded optimism (""Put on your Sunday clothes theres lots of world out there""). But as the camera moves in on Earth and focuses in on a major American city we see utter devastation empty skyscraper remnants and massive piles of geometrically arranged trash. WALL-E is the robot who compacts the trash and places it on the piles. He has one friend a cockroach whos the only thing left living (cockroaches can survive almost anything) and all in all its a bleak existence in a desolate landscape. But heres the touch of genius WALL-E collects things. Whenever he sees something he finds interesting something that he somehow intuits isnt trash he puts it in an old cooler and brings it home. WALL-E is drawn to signs of life; thus his fascination with his old VHS of ""Hello Dolly"" which he watches obsessively. For as long as it stays on Earth ""WALL-E"" is a great film and on its way to being one of the masterpieces of the decade. But then it leaves Earth and once it does it goes into pedestrian territory. WALL-E and a companion probe named Eve (who is very white and sleek and looks like something made by Apple) go back to Eves spaceship. They go to bring back a small plant that indicates that Earth can once again sustain life. The spaceship scenes are not without charm or imagination. The spaceship contains all thats left of humanity thousands of people living on the equivalent of a luxury liner with all their needs attended to by robots. Because theyre lazy and never need to move the people are all enormously fat. The spaceship has become its own culture having been flying with the human species in exile for 700 years. Once WALL-E and Eve arrive on the ship the story doesnt have much distance to travel but ways are found to stretch out the experience - and thats where ""WALL-E"" goes wrong. The film loses touch with the poignancy and profundity of the Earth scenes and becomes gimmicky slapsticky and cute with a glossy sheen in contrast to the grit of the opening. However the movie does right itself and the power of WALL-E as a character the poetic figure of the robot drawn to human splendor remains powerful throughout - and Pixars loveliest creation.

(G) Disney/Pixar (97 min.) Directed by Andrew Stanton. With the voices of Ben Burtt Elissa Knight Fred Willard Sigourney Weaver Now playing in New Jersey. FOUR STARS They are not our usual sex symbols. Hes a squat little fellow with a body like a forklift and eyes like a pair of binoculars. Shes sleek but chilly as no-nonsense as a kitchen garbage can from Ikea. And they have the summers sweetest love story. Theyre the robot stars of ""WALL-E"" the latest cartoon from the smart folks at Pixar and their best since ""The Incredibles."" Both warmly romantic and daringly experimental sweetly funny and sharply satiric its a summer film that actually sends you out of the theater feeling smarter than when you walked in. Set in the 28th century the movies script by Jim Reardon and Pixar stalwart Andrew Stanton -- who also wrote or co-wrote ""Finding Nemo"" ""Monsters Inc."" ""Toy Story 2"" and ""A Bugs Life"" -- starts off 700 years after man has abandoned Earth now buried under layers of toxic garbage. But WALL-E -- a ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class"" -- hasnt quit. In fact hes still on the job. WALL-E -- who speaks mostly in R2-D2 beeps courtesy of sound designer Ben Burtt -- is a little like a metallic Robinson Crusoe wandering his lonely planet looking for a friend. He adopts a cockroach as a pet. He reverently watches an ancient video of Barbra Streisands ""Hello Dolly"" (Well he is a trash collector.) But then the sleek space probe EVE suddenly appears and she and WALL-E become tentatively friends. (Actually she becomes a tentative friend. He becomes besotted.) And when EVE is violently recalled to outer space WALL-E goes after her -- a valiant tin soldier reeking of refuse but full of heart. The initial pleasures of ""WALL-E"" are like most cartoons purely visual. The early almost abstract scenes on Earth are hazy as if shot through a dirty lens. There is no dialogue; there are no humans. (Stanton who also directed makes references to ""2001"" and worked with designers from the ""Star Wars"" films but the real spark here feels like ""Silent Running"" the eco-sf classic about three$?droids tending a greenhouse in space.) But like Pixars best films -- by which I dont mean the overrated ""Ratatouille"" or tiresome ""Cars"" -- ""WALL-E"" isnt just visually intriguing but intellectually interesting too. Its a kick to make EVE a powerful robot and WALL-E a shivering collection of odds and ends. (Its like pairing up Woody Allen with Angelina Jolie.) And when we do glimpse some humans later on -- blubbery couch potatoes all -- its both a shock and a logical punch line. In addition to Burtt (and Elissa Knight who voices the slightly more conversational EVE) ""WALL-E"" has a good voice cast. Unlike other recent cartoons it isnt crammed with simple star-driven choices. The funny Fred Willard does a few different characters (and shows up in film clips as the head of the worlds last surviving conglomerate). The coolly logical Sigourney Weaver provides the voice of one spaceships computer. The movie falters only slightly and very rarely. The robots are anthropomorphized a bit too much at times. And its hard to completely ignore the faint hypocrisy of the whole enterprise. Disney a giant corporation that promotes mindless consumerism and family-room lethargy -- releasing a movie that criticizes giant corporations mindless consumerism and family-room lethargy? But then its usually best to trust the sermon not the preacher; the tale not the teller. And ""WALL-E"" is a surprisingly moving parable of what we waste and what we should cherish -- and wrapped in a romance so absurdly moving it could wring a tear or two even from Gort and Robby the Robot. Or a parent and child. Rating note The film contains mild robot peril. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Joe Neumaier Thursday June 26 2008 628 PM Falling in love with ""WALL-E"" is easy to do. This latest achievement from Disneys Pixar Studios rotates around a rusty little robotic hero whos built as the movie is with such emotion brains and humor that whole universes exist in his whirring tones and binocular eyes.For the first half-hour WALL-E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth Class) doesnt actually make much noise. Skittering across the planets polluted surface some 750 years from now he silently does his job turning junk into stackable cubes as his unkillable cockroach pal looks on. In a big storage shelter lonely WALL-E organizes his finds - does a spork go with spoons or forks? - and pops in a VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly"" As he watches the old movie musical WALL-E sees people holding hands something he wants to do with EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) the probe who lands in front of him to search for signs of sustainable life. It seems several centuries earlier humans abandoned Earth for a giant spaceship after garbage from the conscienceless Buy-N-Large corporation - provider of food gasoline vehicles and everything else - buried the globe in muck. When love-struck WALL-E sneaks aboard EVEs return trip to the stars he finds our TV-addicted helplessly bloated descendants along with the ships captain (voiced by Jeff Garlin) who hopes to turn things around and head home. ""WALL-Es"" story doesnt push the inconvenient truths at its core but to deny theyre there is goofy and wrong; like ""Toy Story"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" theres a smart subtext to the antics even as theres plenty of whimsy and wonder for kids to enjoy. In the final rushed half hour the antics tend to take over but before then the films cautionary notes against mindless consumerism and eco-ignorance float effortlessly beside the robot romance. And that romance is terrific. The sad-sack ""E.T.""-ish WALL-E is appealing without being too cutesy while EVE who looks like a big iPod is tough and flirty. Their sweet childlike ""courtship"" highlights Pixars magic with nonverbal humor (WALL-E folds into a box when hes scared and massages his tires when hes relaxing) and is another example of the elegance and humanity the studio gives all its characters whether toys bugs cars rats or robots. A lush score and non-animated images including Fred Willard as Buy-N-Larges ""global CEO"" lend a multidimensional touch as do clips from the 1969 ""Dolly."" Meanwhile WALL-E and EVE are hands-down the summers most charming couple. When these two beep and chime each others names you hear a symphony. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"WALL-E (G)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies WALL-E (G)  Pixars robot love story is timeless. In this movie still a scene from the Disney/Pixar animated film ""WALL-E "" is shown. (Pixar/MCT) Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald The idea for WALL-E the ninth and arguably best film from Pixar Animation Studios was born during a 1994 brainstorming session in which the companys founders knocked around ideas for follow-up movies to their upcoming debut Toy Story which was nearing completion. Among them was Andrew Stantons concept set 700 years in the future of a trash-compacting robot left behind after mankind packs up and flees a polluted uninhabitable Earth. At the time Stanton had no story to go along with the character so WALL-E was put on hold while Pixar followed through on the other pictures cooked up that day (including Finding Nemo which Stanton directed). Inadvertently they saved the best for last. WALL-E is Pixars E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial or its Pinocchio an archetypal fable about loneliness simple enough -- yet deep enough -- to instantly captivate anyone who sees it. That quality was present in most of the studios previous eight films but none of those had the cosmic expanse of WALL-E. This is a work of genuine sci-fi filled with ideas and allegories about our future the qualities that distinguish us as sentient beings and the emotions that motivate us to alter our destiny. It is not a coincidence 2001 A Space Odyssey is paid considerable homage. The story however begins small showing us the day-to-day existence of the last remaining Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class robot or WALL-E for short. Brilliantly voiced by Ben Burtt (who created equally memorable non-human voices in Star Wars and E.T.) WALL-E doesnt speak exactly He mostly beeps and boops albeit expressively and can parrot only the simplest shortest words like his own name. Running on solar power WALL-E spends the daylight hours compacting trash into cubes then neatly stacking them into skyscraper-sized towers. His only companion is a cockroach which he has adopted as a pet. He also collects stray items that catch his attention such as a Rubiks Cube and the occasional spork. At night he compulsively watches a battered VHS tape of the 1969 musical Hello Dolly where happy-looking elegantly dressed people dance and sing about a place thats ``out there full of shine and sparkle. Reminiscent of the android boy in Spielbergs A.I. Artificial Intelligence WALL-E is a machine whose circuitry has with time developed recognizable human longings He craves nothing more than to hold another hand in his pincers the way the actors in the musical do. By boiling down WALL-Es loneliness to such a simple and concise desire the filmmakers make the robot an instantly endearing figure. It also helps you overlook the fact that when a spaceship lands on Earth and an exploratory robot named EVE emerges WALL-E becomes something of a maniacal lovefool stopping at nothing to win over the female robots circuit board. The first 45 minutes of WALL-E depict the heros comical courtship of his gleaming obsession (EVE looks a lot like an Apple computer so cleanly and elegantly designed that you understand why WALL-E wants to touch her). Most of it unfolds without any dialogue forcing director Stanton to convey the story entirely through visuals. It is animation -- and moviemaking -- at its purest like a collaboration between Walt Disney and Jacques Tati and it is simply rapturous to watch. Youre constantly aware of the challenge the filmmakers have created for themselves but youre continually delighted by the ways they approach it. The second half of Wall-E in which we discover who sent EVE to Earth and find out where all the people went is set in outer space. The movie adopts the more familiar Pixar template of large-scale action setpieces and overtly comical characters but Stanton does his best to keep the spoken dialogue to a minimum. He also keeps pulling off poetic astonishing sequences -- such as a tango in space between WALL-E and EVE in which he uses a fire extinguisher to propel himself toward her -- that remind you of the joy movies are capable of when theyre done right. WALL-E contains messages about the perils of a consumer culture and the importance of ecological conservation and there are also for those who want them strong Christian allegories. But none of this gets in the way of the film itself which already feels like a timeless classic. In the far-flung future you can imagine an alien coming across a battered DVD of the movie and learning about what made us tick the way WALL-E learns from watching Hello Dolly This is a beautiful movie.

"WALL-E Magnificent new Pixar movie | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWALL-E Magnificent new Pixar movie Not so far away on a smouldering orb formerly teeming with life a determined little robot called WALL-E is making his world a better place.Robots WALL-E right and Eve get closer in outer space. WALL-E the latest from Pixar opens today.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 27 2008 A Pixar animated film starring the voices of Ben Burrt Jeff Garlin Fred Willard and Elissa Knight. Directed by Andrew Stanton. At theatres everywhere. G   Article Continued BelowNot so far away on a smouldering orb formerly teeming with life a determined little robot called WALL-E is making his world a better place. Its the year 2700 the orb is Earth and WALL-Es world revealed in a magnificent new Pixar movie is very much his own. WALL-E is the planets last mobile entity (if you dont count the cockroach who outlasted Keith Richards) following a catastrophe of unknown origin.WALL-Es job which he has faithfully done for hundreds of years is to scan rubble with his big binocular eyes looking for things he can collect for future use or sweep and mash into compact trash cubes. He stacks the cubes into piles ironically resembling fallen skyscrapers. WALL-Es full name is Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class. His motto is ""Working To Dig You Out."" But who and where are the ""you""? Is there anyone out there whom hes digging for?Even stoic WALL-E is starting to wonder. All those years of hard labour have brought him an enormous collection of gadgets and trinkets - iPods Rubiks cubes sporks - and given him an almost human sense of loneliness which he staves off with repeat viewings of an ancient videotape of Hello DollyThats the opening dice roll of WALL-E the newest and greatest of all films by Pixar Animation the little Disney studio with the Midas touch.Although in this case the touch has produced something more valuable than gold the rust on WALL-Es battered frame. Hes R2-D2 and E.T. smashed into one irresistible mobile love machine.A delight for both children and adults WALL-E is also the bravest of Pixar creations. This is a movie not afraid to risk terrifying the same audience it also hopes to charm.In presenting a world so utterly devoid of life evidently the result of war disease climate change or some other cataclysmic event the situation is even grimmer than I Am Legend which at least had Will Smith his dog and a barely recognizable Manhattan. WALL-E is Al Gores worst-case global warming nightmare made real.Nor is there any concession made for the impatient or the attention-deprived. There is barely a recognizable human word heard in the films first half hour as WALL-E establishes an almost silent routine straight out of the comic playbook of Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton and Mr. Bean.Director Andrew Stanton who also co-wrote the film (with Pete Docter and Jim Reardon) was on safer commercial ground with his previous Pixar creation Finding Nemo an undersea tale of a fathers search for his son.Theres a connection between that movie and this one because WALL-E is also about a quest one that explains why Stanton sees this as a love story not as an environmental horror movie.The little robots monotony is broken one day by the hovering arrival of EVE a sleek and spectral search bot - searching for what? - who is more determined even than WALL-E.She quickly becomes the apple of WALL-Es lonely eyes and his clunky attempts to woo her begin to bear fruit - until something happens that changes the destiny not only of the two robots but also of that sad ruined orb and its former inhabitants. And what of those ex-Earthlings? It gives nothing away to say that they are circling the globe inside a gigantic spaceship called Axiom which looks like something out of 1960s or 1970 sci-fi - no accident there since Blade Runner Alien Star Wars and 2001 A Space Odyssey are major influences on this film. The exiled Earthlings have been aboard the Axiom for so long theyve all turned into Jabba the Hutt no longer capable of walking. Reclining on electric couches they gorge on synthetic food and entertainment provided by the mega corporation Buy n Large (BnL).Theyre waiting for the day when Earth might once again become habitable. But in the meantime theyll have another super-sized meal of ""Cupcake in a Cup"" and other chemical delights while heeding fashion slogans like ""Try Blue Its The New Red."" But heres a much better slogan key to the films sentiments ""I dont want to survive. I want to live.""Alert viewers will enjoy hearing Sigourney Weavers voice as that of the Axioms nanny computer recalling ""Mother"" of Alien and the big red eye of a malevolent machine will bring fond memories (and shivers) of HAL 9000 from 2001.True sci-fi geeks will recognize WALL-Es squeaks squawks and whistles as being close to those of Star Wars R2-D2 and no wonder - sound guru Ben Burrt provided them for both characters.Comedian Jeff Garlin voices the Axioms captain whose indolent existence is about to get new meaning. The one human face everyone should recognize belongs to comic actor Fred Willard who plays the BnL CEO who urges everyone to dont worry be happy and pass the Tub o Corn.You might be thinking that WALL-E is an awfully cynical movie and to a certain extent youre right. It foresees a future where humanity has finally polluted the Earth past the breaking point.Yet hope arrives from the unlikeliest of sources in this case a goggle-eyed rust-pot with tread feet and a big thumping mechanical heart.All WALL-E yearns to do as he learned from Hello Dolly is to hold the hand of the one he loves just like that Beatles song of long ago. In a summer season where everything else on the screen wants to be bigger louder and more obnoxious thats pretty special dont you think?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post A bit too much has been made of the silent-movie aspects of Pixars latest ""WALL  E."" OK so the last robot on Earth and star of director-writer Andrew Stantons dystopian fable about love and planetary calamity doesnt say much as he goes about his business. This is little cause for worry. After all WALL  E -- which isnt a name but a designation for a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class -- communicates with beeps clangs and whirrs that speak to us. Hes voiced by Ben Burtt who gave such indelible life to ""Star Wars"" bot R2D2. Instead the problems with ""WALL  E"" -- and there are some -- come because Pixars latest and arguably its most ambitious G-movie to date opens within a post-apocalyptic realm. And as cute as our hero is it takes a while for the movie to find a hopeful groove. When Earths residents departed 700 years earlier on a spaceship the wee cube of a machine was left behind by the Buy n Large corporation to clean up the mess. So he pursues his programmed task collecting compacting and stacking Earths detritus into skyscrapers of garbage. WALL  E is our guide to this lonely planet. And what we see is brown and bleak. His only company is a darting cockroach named Hal. In his rummaging WALL  E finds objects that tickle his fancy a Rubiks Cube a bra a Zippo lighter. For solace he plays over and over a scene from the decidedly 20th-century musical ""Hello Dolly"" Sung by Mi chael Crawfords Cornelius Hackl to Irene Molloy ""It Only Takes a Moment"" creates an unmistakable yearning in the tiny romantic. ""It only takes a moment for your eyes to meet and then your heart knows in a moment you will never be alone again."" For our hero this moment comes when EVE arrives. The Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator has been sent to Earth in search of plant life by the captain of the Axiom. Shes as sleek as WALL  E is clunky. Shes focused on her ""directive"" and as WALL  E quickly learns shes frightfully handy with a laser. In a live-action flick Angelina Jolie would play EVE. His crush goes mostly unnoticed even after a sandstorm shuts down EVE and he stands a sweet vigil. As his affection starts to make a dent a ship retrieves EVE. WALL  E follows her into space. Its not often the case in animated films that the humans are such a welcome sight. Talking animals even bleeping bots are charming company enough. So its odd that it takes a ship full of hefty humans to lighten this films dour mood. The size of the humans came about says Disney-Pixar folk because a NASA adviser told them this is what the human body would evolve into after 700 years of zero gravity. The scripts truth seems more pointed more ripped from headlines about American obesity. Earths former inhabitants do nothing but consume. They jet around on floating loungers for one. They eat and eat (""umm a cupcake in a cup""). Engrossed with their personal entertainment devices they dont connect with each other (though a nursery suggests otherwise). And theyre startled to find the ship has a pool and a track. The movie manages to depict the sloth but not to ridicule it so much that we cant root for the roly-poly passengers on the biggest cruise ship ever. It helps to have John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy providing voices for John and Mary humans who begin with WALL  Es help to see how strange their pampered lives are. Funnyman Fred Willard plays Shelby Forthright. The CEO of the Buy n Large corporation makers of basically everything on Earth and beyond appears via video. Talk about your superstores. Its reach includes the robots the cruise ships and the planetary disaster that has made a five-year cruise a 700-years exile. If that strikes you as too much gravity youre not alone. Still at movies end like the best kind of love WALL  Es affection for EVE promises to transform a community. His intelligence may be artificial but his heroism is anything but superficial.

The oceans have dried up leaving domino chains of boats in the harbor and the only other living creature is a cockroach with springy antenna and a Twinkie addiction as though Disney and Pixar dared themselves to focus their cute-o-meter beams on slashing sales of Raid. WALL-E is as appealing as Will Smith; as competing last men on earth neither needs dialogue to hold our attention. In his off time the bot watches ""Hello Dolly"" and takes naps--hobbies that make stickler mechanics scratch their heads and everyone else coo. When a glamorous cat-eyed machine named EVE lands on earth on a mysterious mission once WALL-E learns to dodge her laser arm the two embark on an intergenerational romance. She looks like an iPod bred with an egg; hes grimy and beige yet boots up with Macs familiar ""bong."" When they share an electrical spark WALL-E--clutching a fire extinguisher--moans and drenches her in a pearl necklace. Theyre happy for a moment but before WALL-E can try out this odd human trick of holding hands (as mystifying to him as the spork bubble wrap and the mounted fish singing Bobby McFerrin that he unearthed from the dump) she finds the object of her quest and slips into hibernation mode. WALL-Es efforts to awaken his sleeping beauty rejoin him with the humans who after 705 years of floating around in deck chairs in their posh outer space vessel have ballooned into beached walruses. When the ship tilts sharply they tumble out of their transportation devices and pile up as helplessly as stuffed animals in a skill crane. (Their euphemism for fat is ""slight bone loss."") Having spent generations glued to holographic video screens six inches from their face man is shockingly ignorant. They read poorly having learned their alphabet from corporations (""B is for Big N Large your very best friend"") and not only have never seen the words ""soil"" and ""dancing"" but havent even noticed the giant swimming pool in the center of the ship. The captains (Jeff Garlin) big moment of glory is standing. Having spent his career making Pixar buckets of money writer-director Andrew Stanton has good reason for liking fish cars toys bugs monsters and now machines better than people--not that were faulting him for indoctrinating kids that littering blows and exercising rules. His tone is inspirational not condemnational cut through with enough bite that WALL-E never feels cloying no matter how many times he bats his eyes. Bracketed by a riotous cartoon about a magician and his rabbit and a credits sequence that draws on the great works of humans past from Egypts frescos to Cretes mosaics van Goghs sunflowers to Nintendos eight-bit graphics its a beautiful film that makes us proud of the species that created it even as we root for the robot who inadvertently saves us from ourselves. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 28 2008 Save for later Saved Wistful Pixars determined little robot WALL-E spends 700 years alone on Earth clearing up the rubbish humans have left behind until an alien called Eve comes to visit. walt disney pictures/pixar animation studios          View Caption About video ads View Caption of WALL-E a rickety mechanical janitor whose name is an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class is the only robot left on a bleak Earth 700 years hence. He spends his days compacting city trash and piling it sky-high. All the humans have long ago moved out in luxury spaceships where they loll in robo-loungers and are attended to by robo-servants. Needless to say the humans who are anything but robo have grown very fat.""WALL-E"" is yet another notch in Pixars computer-animation belt and its one of the better entries with greater emotional resonance than anything theyve done since ""Finding Nemo."" Its also a marked departure from the look and feel of their other films.Gone are the celebrity movie star voice dubbers (Sigourney Weaver in a nod to ""Alien"" is the only exception). Gone also is the bristly comedic irreverence. In fact much of ""WALL-E"" plays like a silent film - a Chaplin or Buster Keaton film to be specific. And thats intentional. Director-screenwriter Andrew Stanton and his Pixar legions have referenced such films as ""City Lights"" and ""Modern Times"" and ""The Navigator"" not simply as a film school exercise but to increase the sentimental resonance of the story and situate it among the classics. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But they dont stop there. Everything from ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" to ""Blade Runner"" is also cited and most especially ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."" With his squat body and big binocular eyes WALL-E is like a spiritual cousin to E.T. Spielbergs alien however didnt have a love interest (except a platonic one). WALL-E has Eve an egg-shaped bot who drops down to Earth to seek out signs of life. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review WALL-E When WALL-E claps his already wide eyes on her hes smitten. (No wonder. The only romance hes ever known is endlessly replaying snippets from a videotape of ""Hello Dolly."") When Eve heads back into space WALL-E follows and gets engulfed in the spaceship of human fatties and their mechanical minions. A more improbable - and improbably poetic - setting for a love story would be hard to find.The story line for ""WALL-E"" is probably too convoluted for small kids and sometimes it suffers from techie overload but its more heartfelt than anything on the screens these days featuring humans.

"WALL-E is out of this world - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Out of this world Daring WALL-E is a family film with a cautionary message that even parents can love WALLE-E a robot designed to pick up trash on a post-apocalyptic Earth hitches a ride on a spaceship. (Pixar Animation Studios/Walt Disney Pictures) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / June 27 2008 With ""WALL-E"" Pixar at last takes the great leap forward many of us knew the company had in it. A ""family movie"" in name and MPAA rating only its a major visionary work a sci-fi parable of astonishing scope and depth that is anchored by an adorable bucket of bolts and yoked to a sensibility that is - theres no other word for it - furious. Its also by a substantial margin the best American film of the year to date.The accomplishment of director Andrew Stanton his co-writers Pete Docter and Jim Reardon and the artists and computer jockeys who work under Pixar majordomo John Lasseter can be gauged by the disturbing awe we feel at the trash-choked disaster man has made of his home planet. ""WALL-E"" begins on a ravaged Earth centuries in the future; humans have long since fled in cruise-line spaceships leaving behind small robots with sad binocular eyes to sweep up the mess. These are called Waste Allocation Load Lifters Earth-class - WALL-Es for short - and there appears to be only one left in working order.As youd expect hes lonely. WALL-E spends his days compacting detritus into cubes and piling them up; early on we realize with a start that what seem to be skyscrapers are in fact towering ziggurats of our leftover junk. At night WALL-E puzzles over his keepsakes - a Rubiks Cube a rubber duck - and watches a videotape of the 1969 musical ""Hello Dolly"" obsessively returning to the Michael Crawford love song ""Out There."" (Hes not a Streisand fan I guess.)These scenes are stunning in their wide-screen attention to detail and their refusal to let us off the hook. While there is a standard Disney sidekick critter its a cockroach; surprisingly cute but still a cockroach. The first act of ""WALL-E"" is daringly a post-apocalyptic silent movie that picks up where the last act of ""AI Artificial Intelligence"" left off.What keeps us from hanging ourselves in the theater? Two things WALL-E himself - hes an ingeniously designed pip with a timid curiosity and a comically stalwart sense of duty - and the arrival of EVE a gleaming white probe from the BnL Corp.s cruiseship far out in space. Her name stands for Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator and shes looking for plants - evidence that Earth is ready for recolonization. By chance WALL-E has just turned one up a delicate shoot hes repotted into a shoe.So this is what Pixar is asking us to buy into a romance between two robots. Because it is Pixar bringing wit and intelligence to kiddie CGI fare that usually has none the task turns out to be unexpectedly easy.""WALL-E"" picks up speed when the little guy follows his girlfriend back to the spaceship and the film becomes a more familiarly rambunctious action-adventure story. Again though theres magic in the swooping design of the interiors - Pixar just thinks bigger and more elegantly than anyone else - and the comic variations on robot servants. (I especially liked M-O an anal-retentive sweeper-bot that freaks out at the sight of dirt.) Where are the people? Theyre here and after 700 years of being waited on hand and foot by domestic machines theyve grown pear-shaped and indolent unable to get to their atrophied feet for lack of bone mass. If anything this is more frightening than the scenes back on Earth a goofy but ferocious attack on a consumer culture that turns leisure into religion and humans into overfed sheep.The machines by contrast are superior in every way to the people they ostensibly serve smarter faster more alive. Even the human captain (voiced by Jeff Garlin) is under the sway of Auto the piloting system that takes the form of a ships wheel with an angry red HAL 9000 eye in its center. The captain wants to head back to Earth. Auto acting on outdated directives intends to destroy the plant and keep the ship floating through space forever. Against him (it?) are EVE and WALL-E now labeled ""rogue robots"" and volleying through the ship in open rebellion.""WALL-E"" takes the fizzy frenetic action-comedy of previous Pixar releases and places it in a bigger setting visually and philosophically. The movies a consistent delight but you never lose sight of the stakes involved; when the ship tilts off its gravitational axis and the humans pile up against the windows like fat flopping tuna fish the image makes you laugh and inhale in horror at the same time. Stanton and company appear to have been studying the work of Japanese animation guru Hayao Miyazaki; while his spiritual dimension is missing the eco-despair that galvanizes his films ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" is even more keenly felt here.Everything clicks on the micro level too from Thomas Newmans exuberant score to the slapstick comedy of the malfunctioning repair-shop bots that assist the heroes (theyre lunatics taking over the asylum). Pleasingly ""WALL-E"" is aware of its cinematic roots Aside from the ""2001"" references the title characters cozy metallic speech comes courtesy of Ben Burtt the sound designer who previously provided the voices of R2-D2 Chewbacca and E.T. Its he who gives us the soul in this new machine.The end result is in one of Lasseters pet phrases a work of genuine ""soopa-genius"" but are audiences ready for it? ""WALL-E"" is an assault on much that we hold dear our throwaway lifestyle the belief that high-tech narcosis is our just reward our corporations and politics (Fred Willard appears in ancient video footage as BnLs ""global CEO"" vainly urging us to ""stay the course""). The mirror it holds up is not a flattering one.In other words can you take the kids? The movies dense by ""Finding Nemo"" standards but of course you can and should. Expect the little ones to be entertained while the larger themes lodge subcutaneously; expect older kids to marvel and be a little saddened and want to have long discussions on the ride home. Expect some adults to be scared silly others to be confused still others to clap their hands with joy at a toy story that dares to say things our grown-up movies dont. The nagging almost misanthropic vision at the core of ""WALL-E"" may ultimately cause it to be Pixars most admired movie rather than its most well-loved. For now its simply the best.Correction Because of a reporting error the June 27 movie review of ""WALL-E"" in the Weekend section incorrectly identified the sound the title character makes when he starts up. It is the sound made by a Macintosh computer.

Pixar hide caption toggle caption Pixar Interpersonal triangulations In space fire extinguishers can help keep your relationship on track. Pixar The camera descends at the start of Wall-E from outer space to a landscape that looks eerily familiar -- and sort of not. The sun filters down through a brownish haze. What seem at first like skyscrapers turn out to be neatly stacked mountains of trash. Stillness is everywhere broken only by the unlikely sound of a song from Hello Dolly -- and a solitary figure zipping around a junk-strewn cityscape. Apparently humans never changed course on pollution and consumerism and sometime in the 22nd century they were forced to leave a planet they had turned into a giant garbage dump. But they left without turning off a robot theyd left behind. Hes basically a trash compactor on treads -- a Waste Allocation Load-Lifter Earth Class or WALL-E -- who has over the course of 700 years developed a personality. He tries to puzzle out what mankinds detritus was for (a Rubiks cube a spork a fire extinguisher) and he saves a few items -- an alarmingly fresh 700-year-old Twinkie say for his pet cockroach. But most of the trash he compacts and stacks in a routine that is interrupted only when he falls head-over-treads for a sleek robot from the stars EVE (for Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) whom he watches from afar so he wont be incinerated. Eve has an itchy trigger-finger it turns out. The first hour of Wall-E is a crazily inventive deliriously engaging and almost wordless silent comedy of the sort that Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make. Things turn more conventional in the last half hour when pudgy machine-dependent humans make an appearance but the glow of that first part will carry you through. That and the majesty of the filmmaking Wall-Es world in all its epic decay looks real. You can almost taste the dust. And its emotionally real too -- enough so that a cautionary tale about the environment and about big corporations that dont take care of it and about getting so caught up in our gadgetry that we forget to look at the stars all take a back seat to romance. So do some specifically cinematic subtexts. Director Andrew Stanton and his animators have slipped in nods not just to Hello Dolly but to Star Wars and Blade Runner An Inconvenient Truth and the comedies of Chaplin and Jacques Tati. More than just a nod to Chaplin actually Wall-E with his workaholic scruffiness and his yearning for someone to hold hands with might as well be Chaplins Little Tramp. Theres actually a nice parallel between this largely silent film and Chaplins first sound film Modern Times. In that one the silent clown used the soundtrack mostly for music and effects not for speech just as Pixar does here. Chaplin only let you hear a human voice a couple of times and only on some sort of mechanical contraption -- say a closed-circuit TV screen -- to emphasize its artificiality. It was his way of saying to the sound world ""OK everybodys doing this talking thing now but look how much more expressive our silent world is."" For the first time in a Pixar movie Wall-Es filmmakers give a nod to the world of actual actors and cameras -- and make them artificial in the same way by only letting you see them on video screens where they look flat and washed-out compared to the digital world around them. But theres one difference. Chaplin knew he had lost the battle Silence was finished; sound had won. In todays Hollywood digital is whats taking over -- in special effects in green-screen work in animation. And Pixars animators bless them are at the forefront insisting that imagery created on computers doesnt have to be soulless. Wall-Es images are filled with emotion just as silent films images were -- even though its characters look like theyre made of metal and plastic and cant say a word. Wall-E is being sold as a futuristic fantasy of course. But I have to say Im just as gratified by their look back 70 years to silent movies as I am by their look forward 700 years to a silent planet.

"WALL-E | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wall-e ) WALL-E (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Put simply WALL-E is about as charming as movies get. In an animated marketplace where everything is starting to look and feel the same WALL-E stands out because it exhibits a unique identity without losing its appeal to viewers of all ages. Its a romantic comedy where the principals are robots. It doesnt shy away from long passages without dialogue and it doesnt throw in catchy tunes and dazzling-but-pointless action sequences just to keep the younger component of the audience from becoming restless. WALL-E has a heart to equal many of the Pixar/Disney releases to precede it including Toy Story and Finding Nemo (WALL-Es writer/director Andrew Stanton was involved in both) but a sensibility that is more mature. This is one of those recently rare animated films that adults can attend without children in tow. Its good family fare to be sure but its more than an activity to spend some time with the kids. WALL-E is the best mainstream animated film since The Incredibles. The first 30 minutes of WALL-E are virtually dialogue-free. Nearly 700 years in the future Earth is an uninhabited wasteland. Pillars of trash taller than skyscrapers dot the city skylines and the planet is surrounded by a garbage belt. Pollution not global warming has driven all life into space. The robot WALL-E (voice of Ben Burtt) has remained behind slowly doing his job day-in and day-out collecting and compacting trash then neatly stacking it. His only companion is an indestructible cockroach. Then one day WALL-Es ordered life is interrupted by the arrival of EVE (voice of Elissa Knight) a robot sent by a spaceship for indeterminate reasons. Shes sleeker and more advanced than WALL-E but he overcomes his initial fear of her and makes contact. They form a fragile bond - until EVE unexpectedly shuts down. WALL-E first tries to revive her but when that doesnt work he is satisfied with protecting her until her spaceship returns. Unwilling to lose his new friend so quickly WALL-E hitches a ride and soon learns the fate of those who abandoned Earth so many years ago. As WALL-E starts it looks much different from the average Pixar film. Instead of the vibrant colors we have become accustomed to this movie is suffused with browns. This is after all a post apocalyptic world where almost all life has ceased. By limiting the artists palettes Stanton creates a world that is both alien and familiar and one that indicates from the start that this isnt going to be ""business as usual."" The music is also atypical for a Disney animated movie. Instead of jovial tunes by Phil Collins or Alan Menken we have excerpts from ""Hello Dolly"" (WALL-E has an old VHS tape of the musical that he watches repeatedly) Louis Armstrongs ""Le Vie en Rose"" and ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" (popularly known as the ""Theme from 2001""). Central to WALL-Es narrative is the ""romance"" between the lead character and EVE. Whats amazing about the way these two interact is that the animators are able to humanize them through tiny gestures. Neither has a real face and they rarely speak anything more than electronic approximations of their names yet we grow to care for them as deeply as we might any flesh-and-blood couple facing impossible odds in a live-action movie. The task for the animators is even more challenging here than in Cars because at least in that film the automobiles were given human features and personalities. Here WALL-E and EVE intentionally remain alien and robotic. Watching the way in which these two interact is the movies chief pleasure - from WALL-Es initial fear of Eve to her exasperation with him when she realizes he has stowed away on board the ship and is creating havoc to her eventual fear for his safety. WALL-E and EVE are a great screen couple. The film sounds a couple of cautionary notes. The first is the old-school ecological message of what a consumption-based society can do to a planet when pollution runs unchecked. The second relates to what happens to human beings when they become so lazy that all they do is lie around being waited on by robots. One of WALL-Es big heroic moments is when a futuristic human being the captain of a space ship (Jeff Garlin) literally stands up to the movies version of HAL. (One wonders whether the Captains first name which is not given might be Dave.) The presence of serious (or at least semi-serious) subjects does not dilute WALL-Es comedic aptitude. The film contains its share of funny sequences many of which are entwined in the unlikely courtship between WALL-E and EVE. Theres also some humor to be found in the antics of a pair of humans (voiced by John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy) becoming aware of their circumstances. Overall WALL-E does a superior job of balancing its elements although it comes up a little short on the ""science"" aspect of science fiction. The film replaces the real laws of physics with cartoon replicas. Pixars most recent two features Cars and Ratatouille have been fine examples of animated fare but WALL-E raises the bar and reminds viewers of the not-so-long-ago era in which every new computer animated film was a revelation. WALL-E doesnt rely on gimmicks like 3-D and it doesnt look like a glorified advertisement for a video game. This movie possesses a vibrant heart and a solid story. The characters despite being made of metal and having circuit boards for brains are more human than the average protagonist in a summer blockbuster. There are numerous reasons to see WALL-E but the most compelling of these is that it recaptures a motion picture magic that is too often missing from the high-tech playpens called multiplex auditoriums.

This magnificent animated feature from Pixar starts on such a high plane of aspiration and achievement that you wonder whether the wonder can be sustained. But yes it can. The director Andrew Stanton supported by a special-forces battalion of artists voice artists and computer wizards has conjured up a tender comical love story between two robots whose feelings for each other seem as nuanced and deep as any youre likely to encounter these days in live-action drama. Better still their story plays out in two disparate worlds that amount to a unified vision stunning and hilarious in equal measure of what we human creatures have been up to and where it could get us. The heros name is an acronym of his task Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class thus WALL-E. Hes a garbage compactor with a pair of swiveling binoculars for a head a square metal body and twin tracks that make him look like a midget tank. He was designed to stuff the discarded stuff of our consumer society into himself squeeze it into dense cubes and stack the cubes into piles. By his own design though WALL-E has become over time an endlessly curious garbologist who collects objects that strike his fancy -- an eggbeater a sheet of bubble wrap a Rubiks cube a paddle-ball a Zippo lighter a brassiere (he experiments with it by putting it over his eyes) a diamond ring in a velvet box (he tosses the ring and keeps the box). And theres been plenty of time for his curiosity to evolve WALL-E has been alone on Earth for seven centuries ever since the last humans left and neglected to switch him off. Its become a commonplace of contemporary screenwriting classes that a movie must grab its audience within the first few minutes if not seconds; thats why so many of them start with cliched explosions collisions or violent combat. But no film-school formula could have envisioned the quietly magical pull of this films opening sequence. The humor is so delectable the images are so powerful and darkly beautiful and the music provides such a haunting counterpoint that Id love to describe the whole experience in minute detail. Best that you make your own discoveries though. (""You"" meaning adults and kids alike. This is a film for the ages -- just about all ages.) Suffice it to say that WALL-E whose forbears include diminutive personages from ""Star Wars"" and ""Short Circuit"" continues to toil like a half-pint Sisyphus in a bleak cityscape dominated by garbage -- most of it piled presumably by him into towers that might be mistaken for skyscrapers encrusted with barnacles. ENLARGE He works that is until love blasts in from outer space in the person of a robot named EVE (Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). That she is a she is instantly clear. That she is just as clearly a person is a triumph of graphic design and enchanting animation for EVE is a minimalist from the top of her levitating ovoid head to the bottom of her conical abdomen which doesnt need a leg to stand on because all of her levitates ever so lightly. (She is also one powerful female when the spirit moves her to unleash her laser gun.) EVEs sleek white contours bespeak both egg and iPod. (Which is fitting because whenever WALL-E reboots he emits an unmistakable Mac start-up sound.) Her facial features are limited to a pair of oval blue eyes behind a black oval screen but those come-hither orbs are so expressive that WALL-E cant help but come with her court her protect her and finally follow her back to the galaxy whence she came. At this point the story takes a new tack expressed in a new palette -- colors close enough to Necco to be cheerful but also borderline grotesque. And well they might be since this is the big reveal about the fate of humankind or what is left of it aboard a spaceship that resembles a giant cruise liner. Most of the revelations are brilliant both as satire and entertainment. Here again though youll want to figure things out on your own so I wont discuss EVEs animating program which is rigidly simple until she overrides it or WALL-Es role in regreening the earth which is crucial albeit inadvertent. But I will tell you that humankinds evolution as foretold by Mr. Stanton and his colleagues is a blissfully inspired reductio ad absurdum -- or more accurately inflatio ad absurdum -- of the ethos of consumption that now sustains the economies of prosperous nations. Part of the genius of ""WALL-E"" is the seamlessness of its tone -- always entertaining yet also polemic without being preachy. Heedless consumption is its satiric target a healed planet is the locus of its hope. But the healing cant be achieved without bringing the consumption under control. That point is tacitly made by the films opening shot. Rows of wind turbines standing motionless beneath sulfurous skies announce that green technologies will avail us little if the planet is engulfed by flood tides of garbage. Still hope carries the day in a fable that seems perfectly pitched for our times. (And carries it beyond the closing shot in an end-title sequence that limns as if on the Lascaux cave walls humanitys return from its second childhood.) ENLARGE The animated robots EVE and WALL-E in WALL-E. Pixar Another contributor to the films success is pervasive daring -- the daring of a pas de deux done in deep space by EVE who leaves pale blue traces of her force field behind her wherever she swoops and WALL-E whos propelled by a small fire extinguishers random squirts; of the integration in the most rigorous sense of beguiling show tunes from ""Hello Dolly""; of a sensationally funny parody involving the spaceships captain of the passage in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" when an ape first stands on his hind legs; of an exquisite moment when thanks to a security camera recording EVE comes to understand how diligently WALL-E had protected her while she was shut down. (""Like caring for a loved one whos in a coma"" a friend said after the screening.) Indeed how dare Andrew Stanton stop the whole enormous film in its tracks for a WALL-E-and-EVE version of the peerless scene in Chaplins ""City Lights"" when the once-blind flower girl slowly recognizes the tramp? But stop it he does and the scene takes your breath away. Who knew that you could be riveted by a robots dead eyes? Since the movie wasnt made by robots it isnt perfect. The narrative might have done with much less of WALL-E and EVE being chased by robots we dont care about through the sterile environs of the space ships innards. I found the use of Louis Armstrongs ""La Vie en Rose"" intrusive since theres no grounding for it in the story. And I was annoyed by the appearance on a spaceship video screen of Fred Willard as a frazzled captain of global industry urging the ships captain and crew to ""stay the course"" -- not so much because of the reference to contemporary politics though that seemed glib but because a familiar actors presence however brief impinges on the purity of the animation. That said the film stands as a stunning tour de force. The director has described it as his love letter to the golden era of sci-fi films that enchanted him as a kid in the 1970s. It is certainly that in hearts and spades. Beyond that though its a love letter to the possibilities of the movie medium and a dazzling demonstration of how computers can create a photorealistic world -- in this case a ruined world of mysterious majesty -- that leaves literal reality in the dust. Ill write more about this in Saturdays Weekend Journal but for now I must drop my inhibitions about dropping the M word -- especially since Ive already used magnificent -- and call ""WALL-E"" the masterpiece that it is. Wanted Before ""Wanted"" reaches the end of its wild course the violence thats been nothing but oppressive becomes genuinely if perversely impressive; the ritual carnage becomes balletic carnage (railroad cars included); the Walter Mitty-esque hero Wesley played by James McAvoy becomes a formidable enforcer of summary justice and Mr. McAvoy most memorably the young doctor in ""The Last King of Scotland"" becomes a certified star. So too does the Kazakhstan-born director Timur Bekmambetov whose 2004 fantasy thriller ""Night Watch"" and its 2006 sequel ""Day Watch"" had phenomenal success in the Russian market. He whips his action along mercilessly but with spectacular results. (Mitchell Amundsen was the director of photography.) The film based on the series of comic books by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones evokes a secret fraternity of assassins founded a thousand years ago by a clan of weavers. Why would weavers do such a thing? All I know is that secret messages are still contained in the warp and woof of textiles from a modern mill that Wesley visits. And that hes brought into the group because his severe anxiety attacks result from a superheated metabolism that bestows superpowers. TV ListingsFind next listings for James McAvoy Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie on Locate TV. The fraternity includes Morgan Freeman -- he hasnt had such a meaty role in a long time -- and a less-than-fraternal Angelina Jolie who does lots of her patented imperturbable pouting but also figures gorgeously in several sensational action sequences. The story parses in moral terms even though it doesnt seem to for a very long time and the instruments of the mayhem include a garbage truckload of rats who engorged with peanut butter scurry forth beneath little time bombs strapped on their backs. Lets hope al Qaeda doesnt notice. ENLARGE DVD Tip The scuttling little droids in ""Silent Running"" (1972) -- actually dwarfs in android suits -- were progenitors of R2D2 not to mention WALL-E. This sci-fi fantasy was directed by the legendary Douglas Trumbull who supervised the special photographic effects in ""Blade Runner"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" Its also thematically related to ""WALL-E."" TV ListingsFind next listings for Douglas Trumbull on Locate TV. At a time when Earths vegetation has been destroyed by pollution and overcrowding a biologist played quite remarkably by Bruce Dern serves as a steward of precious forests that are flourishing aboard a giant spaceship. The film has become a cult classic and rightfully so but it was not a commercial success and Ive always thought the reason was that the script written by Deric Washburn Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco dashed the hopefulness that ""WALL-E"" so eloquently engenders.

Literally. In the 28th century the human race has fled to space and apart from a few cockroaches there are no life forms to speak of just empty metropolises abandoned ultra-malls and mountains of debris festering in the toxic haze of a long-ago environmental meltdown. Whats a lonely robot to do? Well in WALLE the little rusted box with the binocular face and tank treads for feet falls in love thats what. An adventurous shift away from the anthropomorphic madcappery of Pixars recent animated features WALLE directed by Finding Nemo and Ratatouille veteran Andrew Stanton is part love story part eco-cautionary tale and for its first half pretty much devoid of human dialogue. Instead there are the expressive pings and squeaks of the title character a kind of sad-sack R2D2 left on Earth hundreds of years earlier to clean up the place. Which WALLE (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is still busy doing dutifully making skyscrapers out of crushed metal and stashing some of the kitschy detritus of yesteryear - garden gnomes rubber duckies old VHS tapes - in his metal shoebox of a home. And then one day a pulsating little object that looks like a cross between an iPod and one of those Dollar Store pocket fans flits down from a spaceship. Its EVE (or Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) sent to suss out whether our world is possibly habitable again. Over the course of a few days and star-gazing nights watching clips from the 1969 Hollywood musical Hello Dolly WALLE and EVE beep and squeak at one another loll around communicating as best they can. Its robot romance for sure. With rich detailed cinematic animation and terrific sound effects WALLE pulls this unlikely love story off. But then when EVE discovers an actual living plant on Earth and carries it back to her spaceship for analysis WALLE secretly tags along taking the duo to a galactic cruiseship peopled (yes peopled) by obese sedentary cell-phone-yapping humans adrift in exile. WALLE doesnt know what to make of this new strange place and when he encounters a bunch of ""rogue"" robots shipboard mayhem ensues. This latter part of WALLE is more traditional and less involving but there is still lots of cleverness - visually and storywise - to keep things going. The attention to detail - always a Pixar hallmark - is amazing and Stanton and his crew incorporate surprising elements that mix vintage sci-fi with old musicals (the seemingly oddball Hello Dolly motif is nicely dovetailed into the narrative) with a meta-cartoon rendering of the future. Dont miss the Pixar short Presto that runs before WALLE either. Animator Doug Sweetlands tip of the (magicians) hat to old Tex Avery toons is a real treat. WALLE  (Out of four stars) Directed by Andrew Stanton. With the voices of Ben Burtt Jeff Garlin Kathy Najimy Sigourney Weaver and Fred Willard. Distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.

"Pixars Wall-E reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Pixars Wall-E reviewed. Pixars Wall-E reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 26 2008 644 PM Robot Wisdom Wall-E reviewed. By Dana Stevens Wall-E Wall-E (Disney) pushes the purist aesthetic of Pixar animation to the borders of the avant-garde. Its a largely dialogue-free story set on a planet Earth nearly devoid of organic life and its view of humanitys future is about as dark as dystopias get. Yet Wall-E is an improbable delight a G-rated crowd-pleaser that seems poised to pack theaters as efficiently as the titular robot crams his chest cavity with rubble. Wall-E (whose clicks and beeps were created by sound designer Ben Burtt) is a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class the last functioning robot left on a planet abandoned by humans 700 years ago. He spends his days scooting around the ruins of a devastated city compacting cubes of trash in his boxy middle and stacking them into piles as high as skyscrapers. His only companion is a mute and nameless cockroach who lives with him in a bunker filled with treasures that Wall-E culls over the course of long garbage-gathering days a rusted spork a light bulb and a videocassette of Hello Dolly that he watches rapt each night. Advertisement The opening scenes establish Wall-E and the roachs world with such economy and wit that its almost a letdown when a third party shows up to complicate things. Eve (Elissa Knight) is an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator an elegant white robot--she looks like a cross between an iPod and an egg--whos been dispatched to Earth to find any evidence of returning plant life. Though they can communicate at first only by speaking their own names Eve and Wall-E begin an unlikely courtship. This idyll is lost when a smitten Wall-E shows her his latest find--a tiny plant that hes transplanted into an old boot--and Eves prime directive is activated. She snatches the sprig away stows it in her storage compartment and blasts off for the Axiom a kind of floating resort in space that houses the remnants of humanity. When Eve arrives at the Axiom with Wall-E in tow the movie shifts gears from a minimalist robot romance to a richly detailed satire of contemporary humankind. After seven centuries in a corporate-controlled pleasure dome in space all earthlings have become obese infantile consumers who spend their days immobile in hovering lounge chairs staring at ads on computer screens--in other words Americans. Confronted with Eves evidence of plant life on Earth the ships tubby unmotivated captain (voiced by Jeff Garlin) at first refuses to believe that Earth is ready for recolonization. But when the ships mainframe computer (voiced by Sigourney Weaver) decides 2001-style to abort the Axioms trip home a human and robot rebellion ensues. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. You shouldnt go into Wall-E knowing much more than that the better to be surprised by the visual verbal and conceptual treats the movie has to offer. Every detail of the design from the contents of Wall-Es revolving shelf of knickknacks to the layout and function of the Axioms central ""Lido Deck"" has been thought through with the compulsive perfectionism that must make Pixar Studios an insane place to work. Wall-E generously dispenses one sight gag after another but it also expects a lot of its audience. Space out for a moment and youll miss a laugh. The story is unmistakably an ecological fable though its tone is more wistful than preachy more The Lorax than An Inconvenient Truth. Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton a longtime Pixar collaborator who also directed the Oscar-winning Finding Nemo in 2003 Wall-E isnt quite as transcendent as last years Ratatouille but its more formally innovative. Some of the lesser characters particularly the misfit bots who help Wall-E stow away on the Axiom could have been better fleshed out (if one can say that of a robot). But the central couple--forlorn googly-eyed stubbornly loyal Wall-E and sleek directive-obsessed but ultimately tenderhearted Eve--are triumphs of the animators art as their characters are established almost entirely through movement and gesture (though Burtt who also provided the ""voice"" for Star Wars R2-D2 is an expert clicker and beeper). Despite the virtuosity of its technical execution Wall-E never feels like a soulless well-oiled entertainment machine. Rather the movie resembles its resilient square-shaped hero a built-to-last contraption with a disproportionately big heart. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Do you forget during the movie that youre even watching animation? Do the textures and settings the fantasyland characters become -- for lack of a better word -- real? That or something close to it is what happened to me during WALL-E the puckishly inventive altogether marvelous new digitally animated feature from Pixar. The movie sets us down in a rusty postapocalyptic urban desert all glaring sun and junk-heap skyscrapers where the only living thing or at least the only thing that moves is WALL-E a cute squat robot with droopy binocular eyes whose name stands for Waste Allocation Load-Lifter Earth-Class. Thats a very fancy way of saying that WALL-E is a roving trash compactor -- and in fact hes the last of his breed. Hundreds of years after humans fled the earth hes still doing what hes been built to do molding scrap metal into bricks and piling them into neat towers. For a while WALL-E is nearly wordless and the director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo) stages the early scenes with a gentle unhurried mystery that is unabashedly Spielbergian. He forges a world thats casually amazing in its tactile metallic grandeur. In Toy Story computer animation perfectly reproduced the waxy sheen of plastic playthings and here in a comparable way you feel as if you could reach out and touch all the metal detritus. As a character WALL-E is like R2-D2 gone Charlie Chaplin in the land of The Road Warrior. Almost everything he does is something hes been programmed to do but after centuries hes developed stubborn wisps of individuality like his penchant for plopping in a scratchy videotape of the 1969 Hollywood version of Hello Dolly WALL-E uses several of that films musical numbers (in particular the gorgeous ""It Only Takes a Moment"") in a way thats at once tenderly romantic and almost Kubrickishly eerie. After a while a spaceship lands and WALL-E meets EVE a frictionless white pod with cathode-ray eyes whos been sent to earth to search for organic life. (Her name stands for Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator.) These two dont talk exactly but they hold hands and burble each others names. Its love at first mechanized heartbeep. WALL-E is a movie you want to discover but without giving too much away Ill just say that the early ""silent movie"" section quietly enticing as it is is merely the prelude to an eye-boggling future-shock adventure. WALL-E himself is an antique mascot lost in a digital universe; its up to him to save a spacebound colony of humans whove ""evolved"" into hilariously infantile technology-junkie couch potatoes. Yet even as the movie turns pointedly and resonantly satirical it never loses its heart. Im not sure Id trust anyone kid or adult who didnt get a bit of a lump in the throat by the end of WALL-E a film that brings off what the best (and only the best) Pixar films have It whisks you to a new world then makes that world every inch our own.

Share Tweet Ever since Toy Story showed the artistic--and more attractively in Hollywood financial--potential of CGI animated films studios have rushed to follow crowding theaters with CGI kids romps that generally come packed with celebrity voices and commercial calculation. Meanwhile Pixar--the studio behind the Toy Story movies Finding Nemo The Incredibles and more smash hits--has continued breaking molds and stayed ahead of the pack largely by focusing on story and taking risks. The latest stretch comes in the form of Andrew Stantons audaciously non-commercial WALL-E an animated feature that adds in live-action footage leans thematically on scenes and songs from a 1969 musical flop and largely eschews English dialogue for half its runtime. Its Pixars most daring experiment to date but it still fits neatly into the studios pantheon Made with as much focus on heart as on visual quality its a sheer joy. Opening on a trash-covered desolate Earth the film follows the titular boxy little robot (the name stands for ""waste allocation load lifter--Earth model"") which has been compacting refuse for 700 years developing a chipper personality and a seemingly satisfying 9-to-5 routine in the process. By day WALL-E socializes with a friendly cockroach sifts through garbage for interesting collectables then packs and stacks rejected junk into monumental towers of neatly pressed cubes. At night he retreats to a snug hideaway and moons over a battered videotape of lovers holding hands in Hello Dolly (A song from the movie ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" opens WALL-E setting its cheery optimistic tone.) Eventually WALL-E gets shaken out of his longtime pattern when a spaceship arrives to deposit a sleek white robot that simultaneously threatens his way of life and offers an end to his clearly telegraphed loneliness. WALL-E is low on plot but high on incident paced out with standalone gags sweet character development and a series of comedic reveals covering what happened to Earth and humanity. (A familiar consumerist attitude and a megastore called Buy N Large figure prominently into the environmental apocalypse.) Stanton whos served as a writer co-director producer or voice talent on most Pixar projects has been able to watch his scrappy studio rack up one box-office success after another giving him the freedom to take risks like a lovely robot space ballet completely unconcerned with ADD-addled attention spans. His audaciousness pays off in a funny gorgeous touching film unlike anything else in theaters--at least until it pays off and other studios follow suit. By then expect Pixar to be heading in a new direction.

If Pixar can imbue a simple desk light with that much personality what do you think the animation house could do with a few dozen fully functioning robots? If you guessed ""miracles"" move to the head of the class. ""WALLE"" Pixars latest triumph is a sweet-spirited comedy a touching love story and a stirring adventure even though humans are seldom seen and hardly a word is spoken for the first hour. Instead were irresistibly drawn to invest our emotions in a rusty ugly little trash compactor with a heart of gold. WALLE is a waste-removal robot with googly binocular eyes a squat cubist body and tank-tread legs. When we meet him some 800 years in the future hes the last vestige of intelligent life on Earth. The depopulated planet is a dead zone of rubbish that our hero works every day to clean. Hes developed curiosity about humans from daily viewings of ""Hello Dolly"" and collects mementos of the departed race. He cant figure out the function of a brassiere (eyeshades?) and prefers a jewelry case to the diamond ring inside. But he senses that something special occurs when singers hold hands in his favorite musical wistfully tilting his head and no doubt dreaming of another being to clasp his metal pincers with. Somewhere in his circuits is a spark of humanity. And with the arrival of sleek pretty EVE a vegetation-detecting droid a delightful romance begins to blossom. WALLE follows his newfound love across the galaxy and in the process saves the human race from its own worst inclinations. The robots are wonderfully realized creations capable of subtle pantomime yet never operating outside their design parameters. They dont bend or squash unrealistically though they pulse with something a lot like organic life. EVE is an especially fetching droid with a vaguely familiar design. She has a graceful milk-white plastic body stylish ventilation slits and sleek touchscreen-style controls -- Apple-influenced in jokes that should bring a smile to Pixar honcho Steve Jobs lips. The photorealistic visuals render the machines and their surroundings with astounding precision. Award-winning cinematographer Roger Deakins (""No Country for Old Men"") consulted on the films visual style which has a palpable feel of reality. Looking at the dust-swept desert Earth you feel you could draw a finger across the movie screen and smudge it. And the film crosses another technical hurdle seamlessly inserting live-action scenes into a background of computer animation. WALLE  out of 4 stars Rated G. Fred Willard (""Best in Show"") has several deliciously daffy appearances as the onetime boss of the Buy-N-Large Corp. a colossal conglomerate that turned the planet into a junkyard. Without sledgehammering the point the film offers a tart critique of our overreliance on technology to amuse connect and provide for us. After nearly a millennium of lazy self-indulgence humans have devolved into dim walrus-like layabouts whose savior is a little mechanized garbage collector. The film bristles with hidden jokes for science fiction fans references to ""2001"" ""Short Circuit"" and ""Star Wars"" that enrich the experience without hijacking the story. Ben Burtt the sound-effects genius responsible for the audio design of George Lucas masterpiece provides WALLEs evocative squeaks sighs and mechanical vocalizations. Sigourney Weaver voices a computer very like the one that threatened her with destruction in ""Alien."" And WALLE himself is R2-D2 with more heart and soul. Continuing a string of successes that pit Pixar films against only other Pixar films in terms of quality animation ""WALLE"" makes the count nine masterpieces in a row.

"Wall-E - LA Times MIDDLE EAST World MIDDLE EAST Wall-E Wall-E Disney / PIXAR ""Wall-E"" is Pixars latest animated triumph. ""Wall-E"" is Pixars latest animated triumph. (Disney / PIXAR) Kenneth TuranTimes Movie Critic IF Pixar Animation Studios has an enviable record of consistent success -- and with a worldwide box-office gross of 4.3 billion from its eight films it certainly does -- its because the company has an uncanny gift for pushing things further without pushing too far. Pixars adventurous new film the one-of-a-kind ""Wall-E"" shows how its done.Daring and traditional groundbreaking and familiar apocalyptic and sentimental ""Wall-E"" gains strength from embracing contradictions that would destroy other films. Directed by Pixar stalwart Andrew Stanton who co-wrote and directed the Oscar-winning ""Finding Nemo"" ""Wall-E"" is the latest Pixar film to manage whats become next door to impossible for anyone else appealing to the broadest possible audience without insulting anyones intelligence. Part robot romance between two mismatched mechanized marvels part science fiction saga with deliberate echoes of Stanley Kubricks ""2001"" this may be the first animated feature to pivot around novelist E.M. Forsters famous imperative ""Only connect.""The origins of ""Wall-Es"" story as related in the films teaser trailer go back to 1994 when Pixar honchos held a now-celebrated lunch to spitball story ideas which became ""A Bugs Life"" ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo."" ""Wall-E"" is the last of that group to get made in part because elements of it are so unconventional. For one thing the films exceptional first half hour or so lives and breathes on screen with just about zero human dialogue. But with the storied Ben Burtt who did the job on ""Star Wars"" creating all kinds of noise as the films sound and character voice designer as well as music by Thomas Newman you wont miss those words at all.You also wont miss them because the world of ""Wall-E"" created by production designer Ralph Eggleston and his team with the advice of high-powered cinematography consultants Roger Deakins and Dennis Murren is so remarkable. The time is 800 years in the future and the setting is our own Earth but its not an Earth anyone would want to recognize.Not to put too fine a point on it our planet is a disaster a bleak and disheartening ruin where every available surface is covered by towering skyscrapers of trash. It got so bad that Buy n Large the conglomerate that has somehow taken charge of the planet leaned on the entire human population to leave with a ""space is the final fun-tier"" campaign that featured slogans such as ""Too much garbage in your face? Theres plenty of space out in space.""Though not likely the main reason the film was made ""Wall-E"" cant help but send out a powerful and even frightening environmental message. Though G-rated its dystopian vision (shot by Jeremy Lasky and Danielle Feinberg) of what the perils of consumer excess have in store for the planet is unnerving without trying too hard bringing to mind the old truism that Walt Disney and his company (Pixars parent) have scared more people than Alfred Hitchcock. One reason ""Wall-E"" is as audience-friendly as it finally is is the presence of the endearing title character whose name is an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter -- Earth Class. What that means in practical terms is that Wall-E is a robotic trash compactor who has been quietly doing his job attacking Earths endless mountains of refuse for 700 years. Unless you count his pal a nameless but convivial roach Wall-E is the only thing still moving on the entire planet.Given all that its to be expected that Wall-E whose large binocular eyes and narrow neck turn him into a squat mechanical E.T. has developed a few personal eccentricities over the years. For one thing hes quite the collector squirreling away everything from old Rubriks Cubes to light bulbs to an actual living plant.More than that this set-in-his-ways old bachelor robot has developed a fixation with the movies. Not really the movies but one movie in particular the only video hes got. It is of all things ""Hello Dolly"" and screenwriters Stanton and Jim Reardon had the shrewd idea of opening the film with the jaunty lyric ""Out there is a world outside of Yonkers"" as the camera somberly pans both the universe and the ruins of Earth.What really entrances ""Wall-E"" about ""Hello Dolly"" is the spectacle of people expressing emotion and connection by holding hands. Not a word is spoken but we understand that this lonely Robinson Crusoe like so many movie creatures before him would like nothing better than to hold hands with another entity. And then it happens.A spaceship lands in Wall-Es neighborhood and leaves behind a sleek white oval-shaped probe-droid with bewitching blue eyes named Eve (for Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) sent to Earth to find signs of life. High tech and armed with a laser weapon that pulverizes anything in sight Eve fascinates Wall-E and he nervously scuttles around after her fearful but intoxicated by her every move.Though this wordless section of the film punctuated only by Wall-Es frequent and idiosyncratic croak of ""Eve"" is in some ways merely a set up for the second half it is easily the most memorable and distinctive part of the film. This segment a kind of song without words is a world-creating work of pure imagination that has been thought out to the nth degree.""Wall-Es"" second half involves the dauntingly overweight humans who have sent the probe (and who are shrewdly not pictured in any publicity material.) Theyve lived for centuries on a cruise liner-type spaceship called the Axiom run by a barely functional captain ( Jeff Garlin) in thrall to a Hal-type eminence called Auto voiced in a nod to ""Alien"" by Sigourney Weaver. This part of the story gets increasingly familiar and sometimes borders on the predictably sentimental. But along with these inevitable elements of calculation ""Wall-E"" never loses its sense of wonder wonder at life wonder at the universe and even wonder at the power of computer animation to create worlds unlike any weve seen before. How often do we get to say that in these dispiriting times?kenneth.turanlatimes.com ""Wall-E."" MPAA rating G. Running time 1 hour 37 minutes. In general release.

"Movie review WALL-E -- 5 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review WALL-E -- 5 out of 5 stars WALL-E. Disney/Pixar Scene from the animated film WALL-E. Scene from the animated film WALL-E. (Disney/Pixar) Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic The late great Stanley Kubrick (2001A Space Odyssey) used to say that if you can turn off the sound and still follow the story youve made a film but if you can still follow the story with only the sound you havent.WALL-E a sci-fi savvy Pixar comedy has almost no dialogue. But with images and sound effects alone it touches it teaches and it tickles. Its the best Pixar film since Finding Nemo. If Kung Fu Panda which riffed on martial-arts movie conventions was clever WALL-E which absorbs recycles and re-invents elements of 2001 Silent Runningand Star Wars is genius.Some 700 years in the future Earth is a vast wasteland. Literally. Garbage clogs the ruined streets of ruined empty cities from the sewers all the way into orbit (space junk). Humans have so trashed the joint that theyve abandoned the planet for a gigantic spaceship leaving robots behind to clean up the mess. And the last one working on this project is WALL-E a cute little Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class. Hes a trash compactor with camera-eyes rusting gears and a job a ""directive."" He compacts the trash into cubes that he then stacks into vast obelisks of junk.WALL-E has a pet roach (roaches will survive the apocalypse) and a curiosity about the people who left all these toasters VHS tapes cigarette lighters (and Luxo lamps) behind. WALL-E is lonely.Then a spaceship drops a ""probe"" robot a sleek white floating dynamo (its meant to look like an Apple product) with a ray gun and a temper. Shes called EVE and her ""directive"" is finding signs of life. WALL-E who spends his off-hours watching Hello Dolly on tape is in love.Events conspire to hurl them back to the Mother Ship where WALL-E is treated to the future of the human race. Were all clueless sedentary fatties hooked on video and cell phones sipping super-sized drinks ""consuming"" whatever the mega-corp BNL (""Buy N Large"") view-screens tell us to buy as we float around in our were-too-fat-to-walk carts. WALL-E must win over EVE and shake humans out of their complacency out of their fat-carts back into our humanity. Thats sort of the mission of the movie too.When you limit the dialogue ( Jeff Garlin voices the ships captain Sigourney Weaver is the voice of the computer StarWars sound designer Ben Burtt does the robots electronic chatter) youre forced to tell your story with images to land your laughs with sight gags to find your pathos in a look metallic interpretations of love longing and grief. Director Andrew Stanton who made more-verbal but equally heartfelt Finding Nemo coordinates a flurry of funny bits that have WALL-E reacting to human litter. And Stanton finds the poignancy in a ""thing"" that cares more about our world than we do.Theres a running gag -- ancient video of the BNL CEO and ""Mr. President"" (Fred Willard) reassures people that things are fine and that we should ""stay the course."" The big message ""Forget that we need to clean up our mess"" wont be lost on even the youngest WALL-E viewers.The idea that an ancient Hollywood musical with its love duets and foot-tapping dance numbers would be the thing that awakens emotions in both humans and robots is pure genius.With WALL-E the Toy Story studio ditches the chatty rat in a chefs hat and talking cars and gets back to its own prime directive -- visually oriented kid-friendly cartoons movies with heart.

Comments click to enlarge WALL-E Recommended Watch on Amazon Rated G  97 minutes  2008 Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton tops himself with this adorably loopy Pixar animation (2008) that sends up consumerism musicals Apple computers and 2001 A Space Odyssey. In the 29th century human beings have long since abandoned earth for another galaxy leaving behind WALL-E a solitary robot janitor to clean up a planet so trashed that heaps of compacted garbage tower as high as skyscrapers. When a spaceship arrives and deposits EVE a trigger-happy probe to assess the environment the lonely caretaker falls hard. The movies first half is largely free of dialogue playing like silent comedy while the second act offers a breathtaking tour of the cosmos.

Arguably the darkest animated feature ever released by Disney (after ""Pinocchio"") and certainly the most political ""WALL-E"" presents a bleak and brilliantly detailed vision of the future that puts most post-apocalyptic live-action movies to shame. WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth Class) is basically a squat mobile trash compactor with more than a passing resemblance to Spielbergs E.T. and the hero of the ""Short Circuit"" movies of the 1980s. The last of a race of robots assembling skyscraper-high piles of trash on a barren Earth abandoned by humans 700 years earlier WALL-E has developed emotions from daily viewings of the movie ""Hello Dolly"" on an ancient VHS tape. WALL-E finds an outlet for those feelings when a white sleek robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) arrives on a mission involving a lone seedling that WALL-E has nurtured in this unforgiving environment. Neither robot can speak much more than their names and one of the films glories is that the first half-hour is without dialogue and it is used fairly sparingly thereafter. But the brilliant sound design by Ben Burtt (""Star Wars"") who voices WALL-E speaks volumes. The courtship of WALL-E and EVE provides many opportunities for smart slapstick some of it inspired by the French comedian Jacques Tati (1907-1982). Among the obvious influences on director Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo"") are ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Aliens."" Sigourney Weaver from the latter flick provides the ominous voice for a massive spaceship containing the pathetic remnants of human civilization where WALL-E pursues his beloved EVE and ends up fighting to restore Earth to its former glory. This is a hugely ambitious theme for a G-rated family flick and ""WALL-E"" takes risks that must have given Pixars consumer-oriented corporate overlords at Disney pause. Foremost is a Swiftian take on the future of the Wal-Mart nation (no I dont think the movies title is a coincidence) where everyone has grown hugely fat and lazy literally unable to walk as they pass their days in a semi-catatonic state at a resort/shopping mall aboard the spaceship. A perfectly cast Jeff Garlin voices the grotesquely large captain who is roused to action after discovers a hidden corporate agenda. Stanton pulls off a brilliant balancing acting cutting between these truly scary scenes (that somehow manage to avoid lecturing) and hilarious action sequences of the adorable WALL-E including an escape from a repair ward full of rogue robots. This dystopian universe - a ruined Earth and the perpetually cruising spaceship - is the creation of a multinational conglomerate called Buy N Large. Its personified in archival footage by long-ago CEO Fred Willard who uses a phrase (""stay the course"") popular with the present and at least two recent occupants of the White House. There is far too much going on in ""WALL-E"" to take in during a single sitting; I would have happily watched two or three more times the other night. Some day there will be college courses devoted to this movie. Kids will love ""WALL-E"" the robots epic adventure and his heart-tugging love story. Some adults may be less comfortable which is fine with me; most great works of art are inherently subversive. lou.lumenicknypost.com WALL-ERunning time 97 minutes. Rated G (disturbing themes).

Updated July 30 2016  353 pm Full Forecast News Opinion Sports Arts | Life Obits Classifieds Close WALL-E shows robots with heart WALL-E shows robots with heart CHRISTY LEMIREAssociated Press Jun 27 2008 0 WALL-E shows robots with heart Within the rumbling stumbling hunk of junk that is WALL-E beats the sweetest warmest heart - a robotic representation of humanitys highest potential. And within the sci-fi adventure ""WALL-E"" lies an artistic truth that Pixars track record remains impeccable. Following high-concept movies about a superhero family talking cars and a gourmet rat this is the Disney computer animation arms boldest experiment yet. ""WALL-E"" is essentially a silent film in which the two main characters a mismatched pair of robots communicate through bleeps and blips and maybe three words between them. And yet director Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo"") is resourceful enough to find infinite ways for them to express themselves - amusingly achingly and with emotional precision. Hes also created with the help of a team of animators a visual marvel. Not that this is in any way surprising from a Pixar flick but still its worth noting. The smudged dented metal that makes up WALL-Es frame looks so realistic you could reach out and touch it; at the same time his big eyes often appear so vulnerable and pleading you cant help but feel a connection with him. The characters are adorable without being too cutesy accessible to adults and children alike. Ben Burtt a multiple Oscar winner who created R2-D2s signature sound effects in the ""Star Wars"" movies provides the ""voice"" of WALL-E or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class. Seven hundred years after Earth was abandoned leaving the planet looking like a post-apocalyptic Tomorrowland WALL-E is still doing the job he was programmed to do pick up all the trash he sees around him and compress it into tidy packages. But hes a romantic at heart with an eye for nostalgia sifting through garbage for items like bowling pins a Rubiks Cube an iPod a spork. The script which Stanton co-wrote with Jim Reardon from a story he co-wrote with Pete Docter evokes iconic cultural items and imagery without going for the cheap pun or empty celebrity gag. Genuflections to ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Alien"" seem fitting as does WALL-Es physical resemblance to E.T. (Its one of the movies that earned Burtt an Academy Award for best sound effects editing.) Hes an odd lovely combination He carries himself like a little old man but has the innocence and wonderment of a child. Its only upon the arrival of the sleek shiny Eve (voiced by Elissa Knight) a robot sent back to the planet on a search mission that he realizes how lonely hes been. That shes everything hes not - new quick high-tech efficient - is only part of the allure. Shes someone with whom he can finally share all the lost treasures hes amassed and she seems open to the idea of making a friend in him too. Meanwhile somewhere in the universe the remaining humans are lolling about in a giant flying cruise ship. (Kathy Najimy and Pixar veteran John Ratzenberger provide two of the passengers voices with Jeff Garlin as their boisterous but clueless captain.) Thanks to the big evil corporation that runs the place (and ruined Earth) every convenience is available at their chubby fingertips - oh yes we as a people have gotten fatter and lazier in the future it seems. And the possibility of useless consumption is overpowering and ever-present. So maybe its more than a little hypocritical for a movie thats being distributed by a worldwide entertainment conglomerate to condemn needless spending on food toys stuff you name it. Fred Willard the only live-action human plays the films CEO with typically humorous buffoonery - perhaps thats intended to make the message more palatable. You could busy your brain which such complex thoughts. Youre more likely though to walk out of the theater with the rare joy of knowing that youve just witnessed something that touched your heart. x Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment x Report Cancel Report Abuse x Watch this discussion.

Pixars ninth consecutive wonder of the animated world is a simple yet deeply imagined piece of speculative fiction. Despite the decade-plus since its inception ""Wall-E"" is a film very much of its moment although in a cheeky uninsistent way; it has plenty to say but does so in a light insouciant manner that allows you to take the message or leave it on the table. Adroitly borrowing from many artistic sources and synthesizing innumerable influences Pixar stalwart Andrew Stantons first directorial outing since ""Finding Nemo"" walks a fine line between the rarefied and the immediately accessible as it explores new territory for animation yet remains sufficiently crowd-pleasing to indicate celestial B.O. for this G-rated summer offering. Sci-fi films have offered up an endless supply of robots and droids just as they have imagined numerous visions of post-apocalyptic Earthscapes and both elements are central to ""Wall-E."" But how many films sci-fi or otherwise have proposed a future human civilization populated by people so fat that they cant raise themselves from their mobile chairs in which they sit connected to phones screens and super-sized cups? One cant help but speculate about the perverse prospect of plus-sized multiplexers laughing at these genuinely funny scenes while digging into their popcorn and slurping their sodas. On its most elementary level ""Wall-E"" is a wistful robot-meets-robot love story in which two lonely and compatible souls if that is an applicable term meet in utterly against-the-odds circumstances. Its 700 years since humans have vacated planet Earth for unspecified reasons and the only active inhabitants of a once-major American city are the title character -- a small trash compactor on treads -- and his pet cockroach. To modern audiences the amber-hued vistas of the abandoned metropolis will recall the effective opening stretch of ""I Am Legend"" although the city here has been dead for so long that parts of it have become overgrown in the manner of Mayan ruins. Also Wall-E has been so industrious that he (the gender is suggested if not verified) has built neat piles of compacted metal that rival the deteriorated skyscrapers in height and architectural distinction. Although others of his ilk (officially Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) have fallen by the wayside Wall-E who consists of binocular-like eyes and claw-arms attached to an adaptable box frame atop triangular treads has clearly been built to last and only needs a blast of sunlight to recharge. Hes a collector who lives in a tchotchke-filled space that resembles a larger version of himself and hes got a single VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly"" of all things to keep him company and instruct him in the ways of human courtship. Unexpectedly Wall-E soon needs some social skills due to the spaceship arrival of Eve (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). A flying white robot (voiced by Elissa Knight) who roughly resembles a plastic penguin with a black monitor for a face and a head body and limbs that disarmingly dont physically connect Eve is a superior being in every respect. She spars physically with Wall-E who would probably fall for any creature to come his way but quickly develops a yen to hold her hand -- for him the ultimate consummation of desire. One of Stantons bold strokes is to withhold any ""dialogue"" such as it is for 16 minutes a decision surely made long before the appearance of a similar strategy in ""There Will Be Blood."" Albeit accompanied by Thomas Newmans fine score which provides notable support throughout this is a silent movie for nearly the length of an old two-reeler one that combines sobering physical spectacle with sight gags to odd and charming effect. Everything changes when the object of Eves mission a single green sprout is uncovered signaling the return of photosynthesis to Earth. This momentous news must be delivered to humanity posthaste and when Eve blasts off Wall-E latches onto her ships exterior. Having focused on these two characters for nearly an hour the film shifts into more familiar boisterous gear upon arrival at the monstrous craft Axiom a virtual nation in space that has been gleefully conceived and detailed to a degree that could be called malicious if it werent so genial. Its a world run entirely by machines to the extent that human beings have turned into floating couch potatoes too lethargic to move even if they wanted to. These Earthlings have turned into full-time consumers with no collective memory of where they came from or what life consists of outside their artificial compound. All the same when the equally listless ships captain (an amusing Jeff Garlin) learns what Eve has brought back he knows its at last time for Operation Recall the return of human beings to Earth. The problem is are these people ready willing and able to get off their giant butts and whip their distant homeland back into shape? That presumably could be addressed in a sequel. In the meantime ""Wall-E"" pushes an agenda that could and no doubt will be interpreted as ""green"" or ecologically minded. Its a theme that is certainly present at least as pertains to what forced humanity off the planet in the first place. But in a bigger sense the picture seems to be making a quiet pitch for taking clear-headed responsibility for the health of the planet as well as ones body and mind. The adages about how you must lie in the bed you make and you are what you eat both would seem to apply here. But Stanton his co-story hatcher Pete Docter co-scenarist Jim Reardon and the entire Pixar team operate on the principle that entertainment values come first and they have applied it throughout to sprightly effect. Almost certainly ""Wall-E"" stands as the first animated film in which the sound designer/editor/mixer also voices the leading role. One can hear echoes of R2-D2 a character for which Ben Burtt created the ""voice"" in the peculiar sounds he bestows upon the little robot here. Although there is significant pranking and foolishness among the leading characters as well as the ""rogue robots"" on board the Axiom there is considerably less dialogue than in the generally talkative Pixar films which creates a significant difference in feel. A major distinction in message and tone between this and most related sci-fi is that for a story rooted in an apocalypse ""Wall-E"" is very optimistic. Yes the worst will come whatever it is but humanity will no matter what be able to reconnect with its roots. This is good to know. As expected from Pixar the picture looks great and cannot have suffered from having the great cinematographer Roger Deakins on board as a visual consultant.

"Clean sweep - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Clean sweepPixars trash-compacting robot will be collecting heartsJune 27 2008|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE CRITICWALLE Its the surest thing in the infinitely malleable world of animation Get the eyes right and youre halfway home.One look at the binocular-eyed trash compactor starring in the marvelous new Disney/Pixar feature ""WALLE"" and youre halfway home. One look at EVE the sleek egg-shaped robot from space who introduces WALLE to a world wider than his own and those cool blue oval eyes -- which digitally transform into upside-down crescents when amused -- and youre all the way home. These two characters dont say much. The first half-hour or so of ""WALLE"" is practically free of dialogue. Believe me you wont miss it.The latest achievement from Pixar Animation Studios is the best science-fiction film so far this year the best romance so far this year and the best American studio film so far this year. Im not sure if Disneys nervous overcompensating ad tag-line is quite accurate (""the most fun youll have at the movies this summer""). Without being cheap or ham-handed about it ""WALLE"" presents a grimmer future for our planet than ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and its strains of comedy and pathos are unusually subtle for G-rated animation. Yes its funny. Its just not ""Kung Fu Panda"" funny. And while I thoroughly enjoyed ""Kung Fu Panda"" ""WALLE"" is a transporting experience.The director and co-writer Andrew Stanton was the primary force behind Pixars all-time box office champ ""Finding Nemo."" ""WALLE"" is the sort of picture an ambitious talent makes after hes delivered an enormous hit. Stantons co-writer is Jim Reardon a longtime contributor to and director on ""The Simpsons."" The two sensibilities fold together seamlessly and while the second half of the film is less amazing and more familiar than the first its nonetheless a gratifying reminder that in some sectors of the global entertainment industry quality remains job one.""WALLE"" peers 700 years into the future and sees an uninhabitable trash heap. Humankind has given in to the pernicious influence of a single global corporation Buy n Large (in digital snippets Fred Willard plays its hearty slippery CEO). In addition to running the robot cleanup concession Buy n Large owns a fleet of spaceship cruisers offering refuge for the last remaining humans. The main spaceship is the Axiom akin to a Holland America liner the size of Holland. Awaiting the word that Earth is once again habitable the ship spends year after year in space sustaining the last remaining humans -- blobby pampered creatures who never get out of their whiz-bang flying loungers long enough to look at what theyve become.We dont see any of this or meet the ships captain (voiced by Jeff Garlin) until were well into ""WALLE."" The first 30 minutes are pure bittersweet magic. On the soundtrack incongruously Michael Crawford sings the opening bars of ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" from ""Hello Dolly"" The lyrics promise ""adventure in the evening air"" but as director Stanton zooms down to reveal what appears to be Manhattan laden with the wreckage of ancient skyscrapers as well as towering skyscrapers of garbage the air doesnt look so promising.WALLE who resembles the mechanical love child of E.T. and Mini-Me goes about his business collecting compacting and stacking cubes of trash. He is a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class and he has a pet cockroach who accompanies him on his sorting excursions. He sees something he likes he keeps it a Rubiks Cube a spork and his prized possession a Betamax copy of ""Hello Dolly"" From this one musical he has gleaned what his robot life lacks a little romance.And then comes EVE an Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator who initially cant seem to stop blasting everything with her laser gun. (""WALLE"" shares a couple of traits with last summers Pixar masterwork ""Ratatouille"" namely a twisty non-formulaic narrative structure and a hostile occasionally violent female sparring partner for the male lead.) Shes programmed to look for plant life and WALLE has found it a single house plant he keeps in an old boot in his trailer home. From there the film whisks both robots and the plant off to EVEs origin the good ship Axiom. Changing gears effortlessly ""WALLE"" pits the human captain against his mutinous robot assistant (shades of ""2001"" -- well more like an entire chunk) and depicts a whirring beehive of activity recalling the factory sequences from Pixars ""Monsters Inc.""The second tier of robot characters isnt especially memorable and the story amps up the chaos at a predictable point when WALLE and EVE become ""rogues"" on the lam. As with ""Ratatouille"" which shifted its focus midpoint from critter (Remy) to human (Linguini) ""WALLE"" introduces the captain about halfway through and while the goggle-eyed musical-comedy-loving hero of the title isnt sidelined hes required to share the story with a lot of other characters.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesPersonal touch elevates UpMay 27 2009Brave A princess who rescues herself ???June 22 2012Pixars risky robotJune 22 20083 of a kind just not the obvious kindAugust 8 2008Find More Stories AboutPixar Animation StudiosTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-06-27/features/0806250473_1_pixar-animation-studios-walle-sweep,200,wall-e36,wall-e,chicagotribune

A love story between robots. Beneath the top-shelf animation the too-cute robot speak and the futuristic ecology lesson is an old-fashioned boy-meets-girl story even if the boy looks like a trash compactor and the girl resembles an iPod. And like any good romance boy loses girl boy tries to win girl back boy and girl conspire to make Earth habitable by humans. You know the usual. Above all its a delight another triumph for Pixar. Weve come to expect nothing less from the home of the Toy Story films The Incredibles and Finding Nemo among others. Where WALL-E stands out is in its storytelling technique making do without the usual stable of adorable characters uttering whip-smart dialogue. In fact theres no human language spoken for the first half-hour or so of the film. Instead director Andrew Stanton relies on the audience to fill in the gaps which makes the experience all the more satisfying. The film opens 800 years from now where WALL-E - Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class - is the last robot on earth. In fact except for a cockroach hes the last moving thing of any kind on the planet. Because humans made such a mess of the place - the implication is that this was caused by Buy n Large a Wal-Mart-type megastore - they moved to outer space. Currently the human race resides in luxury aboard the Axiom a giant space ship. WALL-E of course doesnt know this. All he knows is that he must do his job every day - clean up trash compact it stack it. Nothing too exciting especially if you did it daily for 800 years but hey its a living. And he collects knickknacks a Rubiks Cube here a light bulb there on an especially good day something like a plant growing in the rubble. Then one day a rocket ship lands and EVE enters WALL-Es life. Shes an Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator scanning everything she comes into contact with. When she first sees WALL-E she tries to blast him. He is of course immediately smitten. It takes WALL-E a while -- as evidenced by his work ethic hes nothing if not persistent - but he eventually gets EVE to check out a movie in his living quarters. Shes somewhat indifferent to him even when he starts offering her trinkets from his collection. But then she spots one item in particular and everything changes instantly and forever. Turns out WALL-E might just have found the key to bringing everyone back home. Not that he knows it. All he knows is that EVE has high-tailed it back to the Axiom and he plans to pursue her. Once onboard the story shifts. Centuries of reclining have left the population a little out of shape to say the least while a steady diet of nothing but easy entertainment on video screens has had a similar effect on their intellect. One of WALL-Es neat tricks in fact is to render the robots more human than the humans. The Captain (voice of Jeff Garlin) is excited by EVEs finding. But complications await. The animation is stunning; the landscapes of the futuristic Earth offer the Pixar folks ample opportunity to show off their wares. Their work has become so realistic one could easily mistake the background shots for real life - if real life meant stacks of garbage as tall as skyscrapers. The biggest achievement however is making the audience care about WALL-E. He looks like an outtake from Short Circuit; you can only figure out what hes trying to say about half the time (though context helps) and hes rather single-minded of purpose. But by the end of the film he earns our emotional attachment; in fact he demands it. EVE is by design - literally - more remote. But through courage selflessness and a childlike innocence WALL-E becomes a hero. What self-respecting robot could resist? Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8794 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.
