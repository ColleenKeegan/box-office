The neighbourhood is a hotbed of broad-vowelled agonistes in Eastwoods Mystic River Scorseses The Departed and now Gone Baby Gone the flawed but impressive directorial debut by Boston native Ben Affleck.Like Mystic River Afflecks film is adapted from a novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane its steeped in local colour and texture and it hinges on a lost child an anguished parent and a grievous backstory that sort of explains all. (Due to superficial resemblances to the Madeleine McCann kidnapping case Gone Baby Gone was withdrawn from the London Film Festival last year and pushed back from its original December release date.) When little Amanda McCready goes missing hopes are dim. Shes from a neighbourhood where residents arent disposed to talk to the cops and her junkie mother Helene (Amy Ryan) has incurred the wrath of a drug kingpin. Those are reasons enough for Amandas devoted aunt and uncle (Titus Welliver and Amy Madigan) to hire a young boyfriend-girlfriend team of private investigators Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck Bens brother) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan in an inert thankless role) who then spend the requisite amount of time earning the trust of the cynical squinty detective on the case (Ed Harris naturally) and the heartbroken police captain (Morgan Freeman) who knows parental sorrow all too well. The Oscar-nominated Ryan is fantastic creating a character whos at once fearsome and pathetic. Casey Afflecks wry soft-spoken poise is the movies backbone and as Kenzies investigation twists and deepens the character enters uncharted and hopelessly blurred moral territory where sacred bloodlines seem to lose their resolution and doing the right thing starts to look all wrong (and vice versa). The rub though is that the films compelling ambiguities come to a head in a final puzzle-solving final-reel development that is so mawkishly convoluted and screamingly absurd that it threatens to upend all the fine work that went before it.

This is the very difference in the art of film making Clint Eastwood is intelligent enough to focus on the subject matter and not to pay any attention to the obnoxious gossip of some of the characters a thing that Mr. Affleck constantly does with great pleasure in his piece of shit of a film So mr.

Im am definitely fed up with that fagotry with which those bloody americans seem so obsessed. This obnoxious behaviour in their recent movie-making makes me lose all interest in about one half of all their films. So next time couldnt they just give us a fucking break and deal with the supposed subject matter of the movie seriously for once instead of going off-focus in such an obnoxious manner?

Giving this film only three stars is unfair but this is often the case with Time Out reviewers who dont like the American film industry achieving aesthetic excellence and try to pretend that it is happening. What the film achieves is the delineation of a complex moral dilemma which raises challenging questions as to what constitutes a caring society and how that society is to be policed.

Eastwood was 41 when he made his directing debut Play Misty for Me. Afflecks a mere 35 as his assured first film rolls into theaters. Adapted like Eastwoods Mystic River from a novel by Dennis Lehane Gone Baby Gone is a scrappy little thriller set in some of Bostons less-picturesque precincts - boarded-up rowhouses rundown corner bars graffitied parks broken glass broken dreams. Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Genarro (Michelle Monaghan) grew up here and still live nearby. Theyre a twosome - they share an apartment and they share a business private investigators. When a 4-year-old goes missing and the cops seem stymied Kenzie and Genarro are called in. He went to the same school as the abducted girls mother (Amy Ryan) he knows the drug dealers and pedophiles in the neighborhood. Maybe Kenzie can get somewhere with or without the help of the cops. But Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and his boss Police Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) arent exactly thrilled with the idea of sharing their case file with a baby-faced gumshoe and his pretty girlfriend. Kenzie and Genarro have to prove themselves to their clients to the lowlifes on the corners and to the cops. With an ace cinematographer (Oscar-winner John Toll) at his side director Affleck captures the streets of his hometown with dark-hued gritty allure. And Bens little brother Casey imbues his character with an authentic Beantown vibe the cadences of his speech the slant of his walk. The actor who does wonders with the curious role of Robert Ford in the slo-mo western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford brings a sinewy determination to this Patrick Kenzie character. And Monaghan and Affleck work well together. Their relationship - a blue-collar Nick and Nora Charles minus the dog and the breezy banter - feels real. As the days drag on some nasty discoveries are made. Lies are told sordid histories revealed. Gone Baby Gones plotlines gets trickier - too tricky really - and the behavior of folks on all sides (cops crooks family Patrick Kenzie) is called into question. If the final twists and turns in Gone Baby Gone strain credulity the performances of Affleck and Monaghan stay straight and true. Caseys big brother has made a tough taut mystery. Gone Baby Gone  (Out of four stars) Directed by Ben Affleck. With Casey Affleck Morgan Freeman Ed Harris Michelle Monaghan and Amy Ryan. Distributed by Miramax Films. Running time 1 hour 55 mins.

The actor hasnt always made the best choices in roles but he makes an auspicious debut as a filmmaker with this moody drama set in his native Boston and starring his talented brother Casey. CLIP Check out a scene from Ben Afflecks Gone Baby Gone Based on a novel by Mystic River writer Dennis Lehane the film poses a fascinating moral dilemma within the context of the abduction of a 4-year-old child. Ben Affleck who co-wrote the script with Aaron Stockard does a fine job treading in the gray areas of moral ambiguity as well as fashioning a highly authentic portrait of a tough working-class neighborhood -- Dorchester -- within a larger city. He made wise casting choices -- using local non-actors to great effect in small roles and employing the best and the brightest in the bigger parts including some actors we lamentably havent seen in a while such as Amy Madigan. One of the films best assets is the complexity and dimensionality of its characters. And the dialogue they are given to speak is believable and well-crafted. Casey Affleck plays an investigator from Dorchester who knows the streets and the local players as well as or perhaps better than the local cops. When a young daughter disappears the childs mother (an excellent Amy Ryan) a drug addict who is both brave and shockingly selfish is drawn into a media frenzy. Affleck and his business and romantic partner (Michelle Monaghan) are called upon by the childs stalwart aunt (Madigan) to privately investigate much to the annoyance of at least one cop assigned to the case (a superb Ed Harris). Morgan Freeman plays a police captain in charge of the abduction division. Over the course of the film we learn he has a vested emotional interest in this position. Not only is this a story of tragedies that befall children but it also looks at the way in which our society collectively approaches kidnapping and abuse. The film is intellectually engaging and the tense style in which it unfolds also packs a powerful emotional punch. The story may take one too many twists but that doesnt stop us from falling under its spell. Affleck takes pains to create a visceral sense of tension in this noir whodunit leavened by an appropriately melancholy mood. But the films most fascinating aspect is its least tangible. There is a compelling ethical question raised skillfully that will haunt viewers. The poignant conclusion probably will incite debate. Bravo to Ben Affleck for a smart choice and impressive work. He has parlayed his Hollywood status into something worthwhile moving beyond and perhaps learning from such debacles as Gigli.

"Gone Baby Gone Strong cast silly ending | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGone Baby Gone Strong cast silly endingBen Affleck has two things to prove with his directorial debut Gone Baby Gone  both having to do with that most difficult of cinematic indulgences the willing suspension of disbelief.Casey Affleck continues to show his considerable talents as an actor this time under the direction of brother Ben in Gone Baby Gone.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 19 2007 Starring Casey Affleck Ed Harris Morgan Freeman Michelle Monaghan and Amy Ryan. Directed by Ben Affleck. 117 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowBen Affleck has two things to prove with his directorial debut Gone Baby Gone both having to do with that most difficult of cinematic indulgences the willing suspension of disbelief. First he has to dispel the nagging notion that hes not ready to be on the other side of the camera. As an actor Affleck has more turkeys on his resume than a Thanksgiving buffet so what makes him think he can direct? Yet Gone Baby Gone is strong enough to suggest that moviegoers - and critics - should give him the benefit of the doubt.The second task of dodging disbelief is much harder. For all of the films strengths chiefly in the acting department the writing is shot full of logic gaps that nearly sink it. Affleck is partly to blame for this since he co-wrote the screenplay with his pal Aaron Stockard working from a novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River). In most other respects Affleck deserves kudos for what he has achieved with Gone Baby Gone a crime thriller that relies on situational ethics for its twists and jolts. As a character says in an ominous moment ""We dont know why people do what they do. Everybody looks out his own window.""Affleck wisely places the film in a setting familiar to him the blue-collar Dorchester neighbourhood of Boston right across the river from Afflecks hometown of Cambridge Mass. Theres so much Beantown flavour you almost need subtitles to understand the accent and expressions.Afflecks casting choices are aces and all thoughts of nepotism regarding the use of brother Casey in the lead must be knocked on the head.This is the year where Casey Affleck has finally come out from under Bens shadow with estimable performances here and in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.Casey is Patrick Kenzie a private eye who is 31 looks 21 and claims to be 41. His boyish face doesnt help him in the task of chasing credit deadbeats his main source of income. But he and fellow flatfoot Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) who is also his live-in girlfriend manage to make a modest living.A knock on their apartment door brings an assignment that spells trouble. A young neighbourhood girl named Amanda has been missing for three days apparently kidnapped from her junkie mother Helene (Amy Ryan) and the cops seem ready to give the tot up for lost. The stats on safe recovery are gloomy.Helenes brother Lionel (Titus Welliver) and sister-in-law Bea (Amy Madigan) want to hire Patrick and Angie to snoop around for Amanda. They reason that the duo knows the neighbourhood and they might turn up leads the police have missed. Angie is apprehensive (""I dont want to find a little kid in a dumpster"") but she and Patrick cant turn down the desperate request.The Boston police arent eager to have Patrick and Angie meddle in their affairs. Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and his Crimes Against Children unit are on the case and Doyles interest is more than professional duty. He lost a child once too and he knows what it feels like.Doyle reluctantly assigns two senior officers Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) to work with the detectives but its hardly a meeting of the minds - until a long-shot lead turns up surprising evidence.Gone Baby Gone is a curious beast. For about two-thirds of the running time its a competent thriller with guaranteed interest in the fate of a missing youngster.The only thing that really grates is the suggestion that Patrick a man of slim build and pious Catholic persuasion is capable of brutally knocking out thugs who get in his way. Despite Casey Afflecks very fine acting theres nothing he can do that would make Patrick seem like the winner of a barroom brawl.The final act is where the real trouble begins. Not much can be said about it without risking spoilers. Suffice to say that the only thing that could make it less believable would be the arrival of E.T. in a flying saucer with a signed confession of alien abduction.Could it be that Ben Affleck has starred in so many bad movies hes forgotten how to write a good one? But his eye for actors is above reproach. Harris and Ryan are the standouts of the supporting cast delivering scene-stealing performances in their roles as world-weary cop and damaged mother.Monaghan fares less well. Her sidekick character Angie smacks of tokenism an attempt to up the movies estrogen content. You could remove all of Monaghans scenes from the movie without affecting the plot one jot but thats not to slight her ability.She awaits a better movie perhaps one directed by a newly redeemed and reinvigorated Ben Affleck.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Big mystery Where is the little girl in Gone Baby Gone? - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeBig mystery Where is the little girl in Gone Baby Gone?BIGGER MYSTERY WHEN DID BEN AFFLECK BECOME A TERRIFIC DIRECTOR?By Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 10/19/2007 013137 AM PDTUpdated 10/19/2007 063814 AM PDT Under normal circumstances Ben Affleck and Clint Eastwood are not names that should ever be used in the same sentence except possibly to suggest ideas - and careers - in direct opposition The best thing about Clint Eastwood movies is that Ben Affleck isnt in any of them. That sort of thing. But in ""Gone Baby Gone"" - Ben Afflecks first film as a director and second as co-writer - he has created a worthy companion piece to Eastwoods brooding ""Mystic River."" Both are adaptations of books by crime novelist Dennis Lehane and both are set on the stoops and in the taverns of the fiercely working-class neighborhoods of South Boston. Eastwoods picture has a slightly more magisterial quality but Affleck seems to know every one of the characters in his movie personally. Obviously the star of ""Gigli"" ""Pearl Harbor ""Reindeer Games"" and ""Jersey Girl"" has plenty to answer for. And by taking advantage of his strong feeling for the blue-collar Boston neighborhoods where he grew up - and that he wrote about with Matt Damon in the Oscar-winning screenplay for ""Good Will Hunting"" - Affleck has done just that. The opening shots of ""Gone Baby Gone"" pick up almost exactly where ""Mystic River"" left off. A parade of TV news trucks has brought the working stiffs of Dorchester out onto their stoops and Afflecks camera glides across the faces that look like pounded slabs of meat. The Boston Police Department has turned out in force ""guarding the sidewalk"" around the row house from which 4-year-old Amanda McCready was snatched.Advertisement That sneering observation comes from Patrick Kenzie a private investigator who grew up in the neighborhood played by Bens younger brother Casey Affleck (""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford""). Patrick and Angie Genarro (Michelle Monaghan) are the heroes of an early series of Lehanes crime novels. Longtime partners Angie and Patrick have gone past the tipping point of friendship and fallen in love. When Bea McCready Amandas aunt (fortunately no one ever refers to the character played by Amy Madigan as Aunt Bea) and Beas brother Lionel (Titus Welliver) approach the pair about assisting the police with their investigation Angie wants no part of it. She doesnt want to find a dead child in a dumpster. High-minded private detectives who turn down paying cases while living in crummy apartments are a staple of the genre; it demonstrates their incorruptibility. But among the welcome surprises that make ""Gone Baby Gone"" almost criminally good is that every character demonstrates some degree of moral ambiguity. As with ""A History of Violence"" two years ago in this movie you never know whos going to do the right thing at the wrong time. The one person in little Amandas life who can be counted on to do the wrong thing every time is her mother Helene (Amy Ryan in a spectacular breakout performance from her usual run of bit parts). When Patrick and Angie show up to talk to Helene she doesnt appear overly concerned about her daughter. She and her absolutely atrocious best friend Dottie (Jill Quigg one of Afflecks remarkable neighborhood finds) take turns lobbing insults at everyone in the room. Helene is the character who gives the story its electric charge the wildly unsympathetic mother of a kidnapped child. A drug mule for a Haitian thug named Cheese Helene has obviously been attending to her own needs before her daughters as Patrick and Angie discover. ""They kidnap the furniture too?"" Patrick says surveying the childs nearly empty bedroom. Patrick is one of those guys strangers seem to instantly dislike and the first person he rubs the wrong way is Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) a uniformed cop who heads a special unit devoted to finding abducted children. Hes the one character who isnt an easy fit with the rest of the movie. Theres nothing wrong with Freemans performance but as written Doyle seems to drop into the story just long enough to make a dramatic speech about having had his own 12-year-old daughter kidnapped and murdered. Then like one of the kids on milk cartons he chases hes gone. Doyle reappears just long enough to take the blame for a case that goes sour then makes what feels like too early and ignominious a departure for an actor of Freemans stature. Someone lesser known might actually be more convincing in the role. The two cops assigned to the case Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) dont seem to care for Patrick either. And he doesnt win any friends at a neighborhood tavern where Helene is rumored to do her drinking and snort lines of coke. With her daughter balanced next to her on the bar. The film is full of scenes that make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Much as Patrick has been hired because he knows his way around the neighborhood the Affleck brothers bring their own layer of gritty verisimilitude to the look sound and feel of the picture. Casey Affleck may not be anybodys obvious choice for a hard-boiled detective but his performance is so good that - like his brothers - it can be mentioned in the same breath as his ""Mystic River"" counterparts Sean Penn. The big speeches are left to Freeman and Ed Harris but the movie belongs to Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan. Despite the title with its suggestive rumble of a drag racing movie ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a movie that deserves to be taken very seriously. And now so does its director Ben Affleck.

Starring Casey Affleck Michelle Monaghan Morgan Freeman Ed Harris and Amy Ryan. Directed by Ben Affleck. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Somewhere along the line a perception has arisen that Ben Affleck needs to do something to redeem himself. Im not sure what exactly he did wrong or if its a combination of things or just some lingering ""Gigli"" fallout but if ""Gone Baby Gone"" doesnt make the case for Affleck as a genuine talent nothing will. In this his first film as a director he has had the good fortune to luck into a good story - a story so good that maybe anybody working with a healthy budget and a team of professionals could have turned out something decent. But budgets and stories and even a strong cast cant account for the uniform excellence of the performances in ""Gone Baby Gone."" Even bit players are detailed and vivid. Scenes have emotional shape and theres no doubting Afflecks feel for this world. As in Dennis Lehanes novel of the same title the story is set in Boston and involves the abduction of a 4-year-old girl. Affleck grew up in Cambridge Mass. and just the authenticity of the Boston accents here - not only the sounds but the attitude and the spirit - grounds his movie in reality. But Affleck has not set out to depict Boston in general but a specific lowlife milieu. In the opening scene an ostensibly distraught young mother talks to local TV cameras about her missing girl. The impulse is to sympathize with her but its impossible not to notice This woman is dumb as a post. One might think playing dumb is easy but actors usually end up commenting on the stupid characters they play hinting to the audience of theyre own intelligence while playing dumb. But Amy Ryan who plays the mother Helene doesnt do that. She gives us the stupidity in pure form - plus the sluttiness the drunkenness the cocaine addiction and the colossal vulgarity. Ryan plays a horror show without once indicating some secret cause blighted nobility or private shame. Helene is an idiot monster and thats what Ryan presents beautifully and brilliantly. Seeing her in these early scenes is the first indication of Afflecks sure hand with his actors. The second indication comes in an early scene in which Patrick (Casey Affleck) the private detective hired by the family to find the missing girl is confronted by hostile goons in a sleazy bar. The scene is well written and suspenseful but the revelation is Casey Affleck who heretofore has been a rather wormy uncharismatic screen presence. Every young actor should have a brother like Ben. In this scene Casey Affleck suddenly commands the screen with an offbeat strength and from that point on he holds the viewers attention and respect. As a director Ben Affleck has a lot of story to cover some of it labyrinthine but his screenplay (which he co-wrote with Aaron Stockard) lays it all out methodically. The private detective and his girlfriend/partner (Michelle Monag- han) explore the seamy side of the case working in an uneasy partnership with a veteran police detective (Ed Harris) and the head of the missing-persons unit (Morgan Freeman). Both Harris and Freeman let us feel the weight and the scars that come from years spent confronting irrationality selfishness and evil. Imagine a career spent dealing every day with people like the one Ryan plays. Imagine what that would do to anybodys concept of humanity. ""Gone Baby Gone"" deals in gray areas in which stories that seem simple on the local news are more complicated upon reflection. Though at times a bit drawn out the film is intelligent and always heading somewhere. And at one point it features something rare in American movies and not all that common in Europe - a conversation between two characters who completely disagree who are both sure theyre right in which the filmmaker doesnt tip his hand. Viewers may find themselves continuing that argument out into the parking lot. -- Advisory Strong language lewd talk and violence.

Films directed by actors tend to focus on the actors - and thats certainly the case with this one. But Affleck is no slouch in the storytelling department and he certainly knows his way around his native Boston. Bens baby-faced brother Casey (showcased to lesser effect as killer Bob Ford in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"") leads a strong ensemble in a star-making performance as Patrick a two-bit gumshoe who is hired by the aunt (Amy Madigan) of a missing 4-year-old girl. Patricks longtime partner and girlfriend Angie (Michelle Monaghan) isnt crazy about the idea; their expertise is in tracking down debtors not little girls. The police chief and a pair of cynical hardened detectives (Ed Harris and John Ashton) reluctantly share their leads in the case all the while condescending to the junior sleuths. But Patrick knows the mean streets and bars of the working-class Dorchester neighborhood. He susses out a connection between the missing child her substance-abusing promiscuous single mother (Amy Ryan) and a missing drug shipment. Suspense builds up to a bungled ransom attempt that seems to be the end of the story after just one hour. But like any good noir hero Patrick wont rest until the culprits - which could include a child molester and some dirty cops - are apprehended. A good deal of blood is shed - including some of Patricks - as the flick goes to some very dark places both literally and metaphorically. Director Affleck has a solid visual style and an effectively offbeat sense of casting. The little-known Ryan and Ashton best known for the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies are especially good as is Titus Welliver as the missing childs uncle. Rescued from a run of saintly roles Morgan Freeman plays a police chief with questionable motives. Thats to Afflecks credit as is the fact that he tightly reins in performers who might be tempted to go over the top. This was definitely not the case with Clint Eastwoods ""Mystic River"" which was also adapted from a Lehane novel about a missing youngster. Even the Boston-set ""The Departed"" would have benefited from some restraint on Jack Nicholsons part. For all of Afflecks skill he cant entirely put over a credulity-straining ending that probably worked better on the printed page. At the same time the deeply disturbing windup of ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a real talker. And thats not something you can say about many movies these days. GONE BABY GONE Running time 115 minutes.

ENLARGE The camera cant seem to get enough of Benicio Del Toros face in ""Things We Lost in the Fire."" At first its off-putting even oppressive an in-your-face performance of such insistent unsubtlety as to make you wonder if he has lost all sense of proportion. But no he has not. Mr. Del Toro is a fearless actor and his Jerry a heroin addict lurching toward redemption is the heart and soul as well as the haunted rubbery visage of a story of grief and loss that would be fairly lifeless without him. This is not to discount the performance of his co-star Halle Berry. She plays Audrey a wife and mother whose serene happy life is shattered when her husband Brian (David Duchovny) is struck down in a spasm of random violence. Ms. Berry is skillful and affecting occasionally ferocious and subtle enough for two in what is essentially a two-character drama. After Brians death Audrey provides bed -- in the garage -- and board for Jerry who was her husbands close friend since childhood (and who Audrey believes in her distress was indirectly responsible for his death). But there are limits to what any actress can do within the confines of a script by Allan Loeb that lurches in its turn from one arbitrary notion to another on the way to rehabilitation for its hero and heroine alike. ENLARGE Halle Berry (center) as a young widow in Things We Lost in the Fire The film was directed by Susanne Bier whose praises Ive sung on the occasions of three brilliant Danish-language films ""Open Hearts"" ""Brothers"" and ""After the Wedding."" Her work in all three was spontaneous and intimate with a camera style notable for its fluid searching motion. She brings some of the same techniques to this her American debut and achieves a similar intimacy at several lovely moments including one with Jerry in a swimming pool teaching Audreys young son to put his head under water. Flawed as it is the movie as a whole is a guilty pleasure. If truth be told Ms. Biers searching camera (the cinematographer was Tom Stern) is a problematic fit with this melodramatic material which doesnt need to be searched for; its already out there in italics and boldface. Remarkably though Mr. Del Toro proves that bigger and much bolder can be better than tasteful restraint. Some of his grimaces recall Gena Rowlands channeling Popeye. Some of his posturings are clownish or grotesque and goodness knows he makes no effort to soften Jerrys edges -- the guy is a disaster that couldnt wait to happen. Yet Jerry is alive and you cant take your eyes off him. Heres a style of acting so old that its new. ENLARGE Gone Baby Gone Casey Affleck makes an improbable but plausible hero in ""Gone Baby Gone."" Hes Patrick Kenzie a diffident private eye who turns out to be one smart sheep among underworld wolves. This thriller about the search for a missing 4-year-old girl was directed by the stars older brother Ben Affleck whose behind-the-camera debut is not just plausible but admirable; hes expert with actors pays attention to telling details and sustains a dark tone of pervasive evil. (John Tolls camera work gives the darkness an alluring glint.) Yet the script is another story -- not enough of a story even though it was adapted by the director and Aaron Stockard from a novel by Dennis Lehane who wrote ""Mystic River."" Theres finally much less than meets the eye in what amounts to a linear tour of Greater Bostons criminal minds. Even the surprises arent all that enthralling despite the presence of a first-rate cast Ed Harris as a police detective whos also working the case; Morgan Freeman as a police captain; Amy Ryan as the missing childs drug-addict mother; and Michelle Monaghan as Angie Gennaro Patricks partner in life and anti-crime. (Although Ms. Monaghan does drama and comedy with equal aplomb this script gives her little more to do than stand by or nearby her man.) Storytelling problems surface toward the overwrought climax but the worst problem is the unrelenting grimness. Its hard to like a movie that leaves you with no hope. ENLARGE Casey Affleck as a private eye in Gone Baby Gone Reservation Road Its amazing how quickly movies can reveal themselves. I say this on the basis of a little game I sometimes play with myself trying to infer whats to come -- style pacing gracefulness clumsiness promise or lack of it -- from the first five or 10 seconds of the first scene. Much more often than not those few seconds prove predictive. They certainly are so in ""Reservation Road"" a deadly earnest and deadly dull psychological thriller whose opening shot of an audience at an outdoor music recital is at once artificial overlit suspiciously static and yet discernibly almost haplessly acted. The next few seconds at a Red Sox game may not qualify for my own game but theyre stridently and insistently manipulative. A story of interlocking -- Im tempted to say gridlocking -- fates ""Reservation Road"" was adapted by John Burnham Schwartz and the director Terry George from Mr. Schwartzs novel of the same name. The precipitating event is a terrible accident -- Ill say no more for fear of making the movie sound interesting and tempting you to see it -- an accident that touches the lives of a husband and wife played by Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly and a divorced father played by Mark Ruffalo. Both fathers are remarkably dislikable while every step of their way -- a route that takes us through grief guilt rage and vigilantism -- is predictable. The directors approach to his turgid tale is nothing if not forthright. His only aesthetic strategy as far as I could see from the many minutes that followed the first five seconds was putting Vaseline on the lens during a long shot at a funeral. DVD TIP Benicio Del Toro doesnt give bad performances; hes never less than a strong intriguing presence whether in ""21 Grams"" (2003) which won him an Oscar nomination for supporting actor or in ""Traffic"" (2000) which won him an Oscar in that category. He has only given one performance to my knowledge with a Yiddish accent. That was as an ostensibily Hasidic diamond dealer in Guy Ritchies ""Snatch"" (2000) which also starred Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy boxer who speaks almost incomprehensible English. Corrections amp; Amplifications Susanne Bier directed the film ""Things We Lost in the Fire."" An earlier version of this film review omitted her first name and her role as director.

Amy Ryan as Helene in Gone Baby Gone. Photo Miramax Gone Baby Gone 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Soon after movie newbies Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were crowned by Oscar for writing 1997s Good Will Hunting I asked both in separate interviews when they would write again. Each said the same thing Not soon ``because well get killed on the next one. With rue they knew the company-town syndome Build em up tear em down. Cut to today when Affleck at least is delivering. Partnered with Aaron Stockard hes penned Gone Baby Gone a gritty and rivetting Boston crime saga bolstered by being a hometown boys labor of love. Affleck also makes his directing debut with brother Casey as his star. That proved less nepotistic than shrewd. Casey plays Patrick a struggling private eye whose missing-persons gigs exploit his lifelong ties to tough blue-collar neighborhoods. With professional and romantic partner Angela (Michelle Monaghan) Patrick takes a media-circus case to do what the police havent done find a missing 5-year-old girl. The dread is that shes been abducted sexually abused and killed. The truth is more complex and far-reaching. Based on a novel by Mystic Rivers Dennis Lehane Gone Baby Gone paints a stark portrait of Bostonians who are hardened by lifes circumstances yet rally for a little girl. A love-tolerate valentine to the city it feels more real than the gangster-gorged mean streets of Martin Scorseses The Departed and just as tortured as Clint Eastwoods Mystic River. Casey Affleck is superb as a man whose street-tough callouses havent hardened his heart. He works and lives under a fierce code of justice and he sticks to it no matter what - no matter what. Many bit players seem to be locals lending a near-documentary feel. But the films stars - Morgan Freeman as a crusading police captain and Ed Harris as a vaguely sinister cop - dont distract from the realities of this personal project. All this makes Gone Baby Gone the definitive Boston crime film of late no matter how much Oscar glory was lavished on interlopers. And Ben Affleck having been ``killed already can feel vindicated right now. He not only knows his city but he also knows he gave this film everything hes got. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Refurb Samsung 55"" 4K LED LCD UHD Smart TV for 550 + free...

Amandas mother wont win any awards for parenting. Shes a drug abuser. And Amy Ryan captures Helenes narcissism uncut by much maternal feeling. Its Helenes sister-in-law Bea (Amy Madigan) and brother Lionel (Titus Welliver) who call on local boy detective Patrick Kenzie (OK he just looks that young) and Angie Genarro his girlfriend and partner in crime-solving to find Amanda. Hes ready to take the case. Shes wary. Who Angie argues wants to end a search for a child with a dead abused body? Then she acquiesces ""We cant do any harm right?"" Well ... Casey Affleck Bens younger brother and Michelle Monaghan play the pair created by Dennis Lehane in his detective novels. Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard wrote the screenplay. Gone is the wisecracking repartee book reviewers described as a working-class version of Nick and Nora Charles. Onscreen their gritty wit seems dampened by the weight of the undertaking. It becomes clear that the company Helene and AWOL boyfriend Skinny Ray keep is likely related to Amandas disappearance. Its also clear that police Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) who has made child abductions his mission would prefer that the young private eyes keep their noses out of the case. Still he hooks them up with detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nicholas Raftapolous (John Ashton). Ben Affleck gives audiences a fresh taste of his promise early on when he and ace cinematographer John Toll scan the buildings and streets of Bostons Dorchester neighborhood where the crime story unfolds. Theres tough affection to this gaze; Affleck grew up in Cambridge Mass. Here mens elbows score grooves in the bars they squat at during underemployed afternoons. They have the veiny noses of those too fond of drink. Young women with piercings and too-tight jeans stand on stoops staring smoking. It soon becomes evident that being from the neighborhood will get Patrick only so far. The Afflecks - director and star - nail the bitter melancholy that comes when class warfare is fought on neighborhood turf. Harris gives a muscular performance that keeps us intrigued and suspicious. Dont trust him. Trust him. Dont. Do. While the last act of ""Gone Baby Gone"" ties itself in knots and then resolves itself in ways better sustained in popular fiction there are some visceral and morally challenging moments. Patrick and Angie work the same Boston neighborhood that provided the setting for Clint Eastwoods ""Mystic River"" also based on a Lehane novel. Ben Affleck isnt as bent on the allegorical as Eastwood. But ""Gone Baby Gone"" shares the same deep themes. Child abuse and endangerment shatter innocence. But how those betrayals wreck and torment adults is just as destructive. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Comments (1) Gone Baby Gone Recommended ""I always thought it was the things you dont choose that make you who you are"" declares the narrator at the opening of this powerful mystery words that turn out to be hauntingly prophetic. Adapted from a novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River) the movie centers on the disappearance of a four-year-old girl whose life has already been sadly defined by her vile single mother and grim working-class Boston neighborhood. The girls aunt hires a pair of private detectives (Casey Affleck Michelle Monaghan) to assist the police and as they get closer to the truth even the childs rescue begins to seem like a tragic fate. Ben Affleck directed and cowrote the script; his biggest gamble was casting his irksome little brother as a pistol-whipping tough guy but the picture is so superbly executed in every other respect that Casey seems more quirky than miscast.

By Christy Lemire updated 10/15/2007 71924 PM ET 2007-10-15T231924 Print Font + - REVIEW Say the name Ben Affleck and myriad images come to mind. The loyal Red Sox rooter and John Kerry campaigner. Half of the Oscar-winning Matt-and-Ben ""Good Will Hunting"" duo. Another half of the tabloid-fodder ""Bennifer"" couple. A sometimes-solid actor (""Hollywoodland"" ""Boiler Room"") prone to weak movie choices (""Bounce"" ""Daredevil"" ""Gigli""). ""Gone Baby Gone"" will leave you with a new picture filmmaker. In his directing debut Affleck has found his calling an avenue for using his obvious intelligence while getting out of the way of his own celebrity. Co-writing the script with longtime friend Aaron Stockard Affleck presents a place oozing with atmosphere and rich complicated characters. He has enough confidence in himself (and in us) never to go for the safe easy answer. The film is based on the child-abduction novel by Dennis Lehane author of ""Mystic River"" which earned several Oscars under Clint Eastwoods direction. Like ""Mystic River"" ""Gone Baby Gone"" is set on the rough streets south of Boston. Much has been written about Afflecks decision to populate the background of this gritty crime drama with authentic locals; he even gave several of them speaking parts during crucial scenes in run-down bars. It was a bold move that paid off big-time. You feel as if youve been immersed in an insular neighborhood where your block is your entire world and secrecy is a critical trait. As one of Bostons highest-profile native sons Affleck clearly knows this area well. You wont find any regional cliches here -- no obvious cutaways to foliage or Fenway Park. (Though he does thank Sox stars David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez in the closing credits. Maybe they helped out as grips on the set one day.) Working with two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer John Toll and composer Harry Gregson-Williams Affleck never sugarcoats or overdramatizes the surroundings instead establishing a mood thats fraught with danger suspicion and dark discoveries around every corner. Its depressing and bleak but also excitingly alive and real. Advertise Advertise Advertise Slideshow Ben Affleck Private investigators Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck Bens younger brother) and Angie Genarro (Michelle Monaghan) partners in work and love are hired by the family of the abducted 4-year-old girl Amanda McCready. The relatives figure that no one in the neighborhood wants to tell police if they saw or heard something but theyll talk to a local guy they know and trust. Patrick and Angie persuade the chief of the Crimes Against Children department (Morgan Freeman among the superb supporting cast) to let them tag along with the detectives assigned to the case. Remy Bressant (a powerful unpredictable Ed Harris) and his partner Nick Poole (John Ashton) grudgingly agree to meet and talk with them but Patrick suspects from the start that theyre not being entirely forthcoming. This is a hunch that will hold true for nearly every single character in ""Gone Baby Gone"" including Amandas mother Helene a difficult role masterfully portrayed by Amy Ryan. Helene is an alcoholic junkie sometime-prostitute and drug mule. She probably loves her daughter but is so screwed up and selfish shes also unapologetically neglectful. This is someone it would be easy to hate; Ryan makes her such a complete human being you walk away feeling angry yet with a glimmer of unexpected sympathy. Just when you think Patrick and Angie have solved the case another wrinkle emerges -- then another and another. Affleck keeps you hanging on wondering where hes going next but never overhypes the proceedings. And the younger Affleck serves as an engaging figure to help us navigate the storys many turns. He comes off as a regular guy who can be both forceful and frightened and his character ultimately faces decisions that would trouble anyone. That pervasive sense of moral ambiguity is one of the strongest elements of ""Gone Baby Gone"" and it will you keep you thinking and talking about the film long after its over. This much is indisputable though Ben Affleck is a director who surely has more great things in store. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Movies by Lisa Schwarzbaum Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Claire Folger) C Posted October 17 2007 -- 1200 AM EDT In Gone Baby Gone Casey Affleck plays Patrick a private eye hired by distraught relatives to find a missing little girl. Its a local thing Patrick is bred and brined in the same piss and vinegar of working-class Boston as the girls boozy druggy wreck of a mother Helene (The Wires Amy Ryan going hell for leather in a fearless performance). So Patrick (and his partner played by Michelle Monaghan) understand the ties and lies of neighborhoods that bind -- or ought to. But of course nothing is ever simple -- not in the morally murky Beantown thriller from Dennis Lehane on which the movie is based (Lehane went on to write Mystic River) nor in the character complexities favored by Ed Harris (here as a detective) and Morgan Freeman (as a police captain). Certainly nothings simple in the professional arc of Boston local Ben Affleck making his directorial debut from a screenplay he co-wrote with Aaron Stockard. As a filmmaker Affleck is in a coltish stage; his characters veer toward speechiness and in mixing in so many shots of real Boston faces and places he leans on found authenticity as a crutch to support what he cant yet shape on his own. But in emulating the best -- Clint Eastwoods Mystic River Martin Scorseses The Departed -- Affleck the director shows excellent instincts not least of which is letting his younger brother Casey hold the center as a young guy not as smaht as he thinks he is.

Moral ambiguity is the real star of Ben Afflecks helming debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" an involving Boston-set tale of mixed motives selflessness and perfidy in the wake of a 4-year-old girls disappearance. Adapted from a novel by ""Mystic River"" author Dennis Lehane somber pic radiates a feel for Beantowns working-class Dorchester neighborhood in and around which two private investigators encounter a morass of motivations. Sharp thesping and conversation-starting themes suggest an honorable career especially if reviews dont spill too many beans. Miramax release goes out Oct. 19 Stateside. Baby-faced 31-year-old private detective Patrick Kenzie (the directors brother Casey Affleck) has lived on the same block his whole life. He shares a modest apartment with his professional and romantic partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). Theirs is a neighborhood where even tykes swear a blue streak and ones high school classmates may not have known there were other career options beyond cop or criminal. Blue-collar vs. no-collar animosity is a given but theres a code that fluidly straddles all sorts of activity. Patrick and Angie are roused early one morning by distraught Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) and her husband Lionel (Titus Welliver). Its been three days since their little niece Amanda was abducted from the apartment where she lived with her single mom Helene (Amy Ryan) Lionels sister. The possible kidnapping is all over the news but despite the efforts of Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and his Crimes Against Children unit the police havent made much progress. Bea wants Patrick and Angie -- whose missing-persons experience consists mostly of tracking down credit scofflaws -- to conduct a parallel investigation. Angie who cherishes the modest but good life theyve built together is wary of taking on anything that might end with a tiny dead body. But Patrick feels his contacts and the fact he doesnt carry a badge can help. Doyle reluctantly agrees to let Patrick and Angie tag along with seasoned cops Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton). The quartet learn that an impressive amount of money belonging to a scary local drug dealer went astray not long before Amanda vanished. There seems to be a connection and despite Doyles indignation unorthodox plans are made to trade the cash for the child. The case seems to have been more or less resolved roughly one hour in but Patrick cant shake a niggling discrepancy in something one character said. Tortuous though it is uncovering the truth proves easier than deciding what to do with the information. With this perf and his turn in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" Casey Affleck shows low-key but potent acting chops to be reckoned with. Harris is another standout in a well-cast ensemble and Ryan makes an almost certainly unfit mother -- whose drinking problem is dwarfed only by her cocaine habit -- seem real as well as negligent. Helmer Affleck establishes and maintains an omnipresent sense of place advantageously enhanced by little-known local thesps thoughtfully lensed locations and vivid cutaways to local denizens. The feeling that even the deepest shared-roots camaraderie comes with veiled threats permeates the proceedings. Pics only substantial shortcoming lies in the story itself The logistics of one attempted good deed seem unlikely to withstand the test of time perhaps not even immediate scrutiny.
