"Prom Night Forgettable | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentProm Night Forgettable ""Donna you gotta stop being scared okay? Because theres nothing left to be scared of.""By Peter HowellMovie CriticSun. April 13 2008 Prom Night (out of 4)Starring Brittany Snow Johnathon Schaech Idris Elba Dana Davis and Jessica Stroup. Directed by Nelson McCormick. 88 minutes. At major theatres. 14A ""Donna you gotta stop being scared okay? Because theres nothing left to be scared of.""The quote above is from Prom Night a fright-free remake of the 1980 teen slasher flick and amen to that.Theres absolutely zippo to fear about this movie unless youre the kind of person who jumps when formula bogeymen do exactly what youd expect them to do.Saddled with an American PG-13 rating that tames the violence and neuters the sex Prom Night is about as edgy as a Bible school picnic.Played by the over-caffeinated Brittany Snow the jittery Donna being consoled has been having visions that her slasher-stalker former high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is on the loose again.Shes right. Fenton busted out of a not-so-maximum-security bughouse three days earlier. As any student of paint-by-numbers terror would tell you hes now heading back to town hunting blade in hand to settle old scores.Fenton is taking his sweet time about it and not exactly knocking himself out in the disguise department. With his black baseball cap and three days beard he looks like a ball fan on a weekend bender not a threatening serial killer. Maybe that means its a really good disguise but its also a boring one. Did anybody involved with this see Scream or Halloween? Couldnt they at least have mustered a groovy mask for Fenton? I guess not. Directed by TV hack Nelson McCormick the film should be titled Return of the Lead-Footed Psycho. Fenton takes so long to get his murderous plan in gear he manages to alert the entire police force of Bridgeport Ore. such as it is.Lucky for him the cops arent much faster. Seems like theres only one guy in charge and hes reluctant to put Donna into protective custody because it could bust up her prom night - remember that from the title?Hes Det. Winn (Idris Elba) who along with his nerd sidekick Nash (James Ransone) is determined to close every route into and out of the prom hotel - except for the one that Fenton uses of course.The bodies slowly pile up as Fenton practises his blade work preparing for his big reunion with Donna. Its your basic homicidal nut job on a rampage with the emphasis on the basic. If any creativity was involved in the making of Prom Night it must have been when Schaech -best remembered as the pretty pop band singer from That Thing You Do - was convincing the casting director that he could be scary.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Prom Night | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; prom-night ) Prom Night (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoilers I supposea| Sony is releasing Prom Night under their ""Screen Gems"" imprint. Gems? More like turds. By its nature the slasher film is not a terribly deep or complicated effort. To be successful all such a movie needs is a sympathetic victim/protagonist an implacable killer a suspenseful buildup and (most importantly) a cornucopia of blood and gore. The 2008 version of Prom Night misses on all four counts making it virtually worthless by any measure of the genre. Despite having the same title and a similar premise to a 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick (kids getting slaughtered on prom night) this is not a remake. In fact it really doesnt have much of a plot. Its basically The O.C. with a body count. The movie opens with a reasonably effective prologue - the only part of the film to which that description could be applied. Freshman Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) returns from the movies one night to find her father and brother dead and someone in the house. She hides under her bed in time to see the killer (Johnathon Schaech) finish off her mother. Theres an eerie moment in which Donna and Mom lock eyes just before the death blow is delivered. Its the kind of thing upon which a movie can be built. Unfortunately director Nelson McCormick treats it as a throw-away perhaps unaware of how effective that single shot is. He never comes close to it again. It turns out that the psycho is a former teacher who developed a crush on Donna and has determined that the best way to win her affections is to eliminate her family. Thats taking a teenagers autonomy fantasies too far. Three years later Donna has almost shaken off the specter of that night. Shes getting all dressed up to go to the prom with her hunky boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter). Unfortunately our deranged killer has just escaped from the maximum security mental asylum where he was being held. Using a stolen car hes on his way back to Haddonfield with Dr. Sam Loomis in pursuita| sorry wrong movie. But the nutcase has escaped and hes intent upon hunting down Donna. His pursuer is a thick-headed detective named Winn (Idris Elba) whos the kind of gung-ho moron that gives movie cops a bad name. How many people get killed under his nose? At least Loomis had an excuse - he was just a psychiatrist. Winn has the entire police department behind him hes on the scene and he still cant prevent a massacre by a guy who doesnt even have a gun. The movie has been targeted for the PG-13 audience which means that the girls keep their breasts covered and the editing is such that the murders arent too graphic. Im willing to allow that its possible for a PG-13 movie to provide effective horror if its made with skill and intelligence. (After all with only a few minor trims Halloween could have been PG-13.) Prom Night however is about as skilled an intelligent as a guy with his girl in a hotel room after the dance. It bumbles and fumbles and climaxes perfunctorily. Theres no suspense. We know from the beginning pretty much who isnt going to make it so the entire story is an exercise in crossing names off the death list. Anyone think the best friend is going to make it? How about the boyfriend? Is that a spoiler? Is it even possible to spoil a movie like this? It all comes down to a confrontation in a closet followed by the arrival of Dr. Loomis who shoots the psycho six times. Sorry wrong movie again. Or is it? I dont know any of the cast members except Brittany Snow who has done a lot of TV work and has appeared in a few films. Its hard to criticize her performance since the script doesnt give her much to work with. Ellen Page couldnt have done anything more with such meager material. (Then again Ellen Page would have had the good sense not to accept the part.) Everyone else cut their teeth either on daytime soap operas or their nighttime counterparts. None will find their careers damaged by an appearance in Prom Night because their roles are fade-into-the-background forgettable. The set design has more personality. If comparisons to Halloween make Prom Night sound marginally watchable I have erred. Its a bore even taking into account unintentional moments of humor that resulted in audience members jeering. This is a case study for Filmmaking Ineptitude 101. Director McCormack is so bad at his job that he cant even execute an effective ""boo"" moment - one of those things that even the worst horror movies seem to get right. While the PG-13 rating will undoubtedly allow Prom Night to score some extra money at the box office it has eliminated any possible guilty pleasures associated with the viewing experience. Why did slasher movies become so popular during the 80s? Blood guts and Tamp;A. Those were the elements that kept Michael Jason and Freddy coming back repeatedly. Take them away and what are you left with? Prom Night.

Well cast and solidly crafted latest genre product from Screen Gems could strike B.O. paydirt if as seems likely it clicks with a target aud of teens and early twentysomethings -- including of course couples preparing for their own senior-year celebrations. An in-name-only remake of the post-""Halloween"" slasher pic that solidified Jamie Lee Curtis status as scream queen of the polyester era ""Prom Night"" is a surprisingly effective teen-skewing thriller that soft-pedals graphic violence (in marked contrast to the R-rated 1980 original) while generating a fair degree of suspense. Well cast and solidly crafted latest genre product from Screen Gems struck B.O. paydirt taking in 22.7 million in its opening weekend as it clicked with teens -- including couples preparing for their own senior-year celebrations -- and early twentysomethings. Helmer Nelson McCormick a vet TV director making his feature debut and scripter J.S. Cardone establish the overall tone of skittish dread early on with a flashback prologue that recalls terrible events of three years earlier. High schooler Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) returns home from a night out with friends to find her family has been slain by Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) a twisted teacher whos insanely obsessed with her. Donna manages to escape unharmed and dedicated Det. Winn (Idris Elba) promises her the murderous psycho wont ever have a chance to menace her again (yeah right). Leaping forward to the present pic finds Donna still troubled by all-too-vivid memories but determined to enjoy her senior prom with dreamy b.f. Bobby (Scott Porter of TVs ""Friday Night Lights""). Along with two other couples -- lovey-dovey Lisa (Dana Davis) and Ronnie (Collins Pennie) not-so-happy Claire (Jessica Stroup) and Michael (Kelly Blatz) -- they hop into a stretch limo and zip over to a luxury hotel for the spectacularly lavish festivities. The six friends also reserve a posh suite upstairs so theyll have a quiet place for close encounters later in the evening. Unfortunately another hotel guest -- recently escaped from prison -- intends to crash their private party. McCormick and Cardone may be trading on the name recognition of an 80s slasher pic but theyve made an obvious effort to avoid (or at least revise) many cliches and conventions associated with thrillers of that sort. Their villain is not some semi-indestructible bogeyman but rather a realistically rendered psychopath (convincingly played by Schaech) whos all the scarier for being recognizably human. Also none of his victims would qualify for inclusion among the oversexed and/or unpleasant teens routinely slaughtered in slasher pics of yesteryear. The filmmakers devise a series of reasonably plausible excuses to periodically move potential victims away from the safety of crowds and back to the hotel suite (which thanks to lenser Checco Varese and production designer Jon Gary Steele looks and feels as forebodingly creepy as a haunted house). To be sure logic and credibility arent sustained throughout -- the final minutes play like a typically contrived climax of routine horror fare -- but theres a welcome absence of drawn-out fake-outs and last-gasp lunging at the end. Its way too soon to tell if Snow ever will achieve the semi-iconic status Jamie Lee Curtis did in similar roles but her performance here is everything it should be for her character and the pic itself to work. Among the supporting players James Ransone is a standout if only because he comes across as one of the nerdiest-looking cops in movie history. Production values in and out of the hotel are suitably slick.
