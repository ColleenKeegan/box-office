In it she wrote ""The essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural of artifice and exaggeration."" Oh that she were still alive to see ""Burlesque."" Of course she would then have to write an addendum noting the difference between camp and well cheese. ""Burlesque"" is 100 percent cheese -- and a stinky one at that. This tale of an ambitious young singer (Christina Aguilera) and the veteran burlesque club owner and performer (Cher) who becomes her mentor lacks a single original thought plot twist line of dialogue or performance. And thats the difference between camp and cheese. Camp is fun and entertaining even as it tweaks the familiar. Cheese just aspires to be camp and fails. Of course one can always hope with cheese that it will be so bad that its good. The original ""Rocky"" movie is cheese supreme pulling out all the stops and yet winning you over. Thats because writer-star Sylvester Stallone truly believed in his tale of a journeyman boxer who wouldnt quit. He thought he was making a great movie and in a way he was. Unfortunately most cheesy movies doesnt have the courage of their convictions. Theyre meant to be superficial cliched and to evoke knee-jerk responses. They end up stupefyingly boring. Think ""Showgirls"" and ""Hudson Hawk."" Where they should be light of touch theyre heavy handed; where they should be genuinely affecting theyre as cheaply sentimental as a gum-machine wedding ring. ""Burlesque"" the debut film from writer-director Steven Antin is hold-your-nose bad. And at a nearly two-hour running time unnecessarily self-indulgent. Aguilera plays Ali an aspiring singer who as the opening credits roll quits her jobs as a waitress in a small Iowa town and buys a bus ticket to Los Angeles. ""One-way or roundtrip?"" the bus station clerk asks. ""Youre kidding right?"" Ali responds. Once in L.A. she rents a room in a fleabag hotel and lands a job as a cocktail waitress at the Burlesque Lounge an improbably upscale ""Cabaret""-esque club run by Tess (Cher). This is a burlesque theater were told not a strip club. The difference The scantily clad performers never doff their tops and there is nary a pole in sight. Instead the performers lip-sync to songs while thrusting their pelvises in third-rate faux Bob Fosse routines. Ali takes one look and wants in. She soon joins the chorus and then quicker than you can say ""42nd Street"" saves the show by belting out a big number sans amplification when the mikes go dead. The very next day Tess has rebuilt the act around her. Cut to packed seats and Alis picture on the front of the Sunday Calendar section. Not that all is well in Burlesque Town. Tess is in danger of losing her club to the bank; the cute bartender-songwriter (Cam Gigandet) who keeps making eyes at Ali still has a fiancee in New York; and a smooth wealthy real-estate developer (Eric Dane) is covetous of both Ali and the club. These are but speed bumps in between ""Burlesques"" endless ersatz Vegas-like production numbers most featuring Aguilera and two with Cher. These numbers are cut to resemble MTV videos of a decade ago and one song is indistinguishable from the next other than when Cher sings an ""I Will Survive""-type anthem solo on a darkened stage after the club has closed for the night. If Aguilera has a movie career beyond this turkey -- how appropriate that its opening near Thanksgiving -- shell be lucky. She strives painfully for sincerity but other than that giant battleship of a voice is cutesy bland at best annoyingly arch at worst. Cher in her first movie in seven years looks as ahem young as ever which is a problem since the upper half of her face no longer moves. Fortunately her eyes are expressive and her voice still capable of laying others out cold with its tone of withering sarcasm. (Her hands are visible in several close-up shots only serving to remind us that on some body parts even Cher cant turn back time.) Having said all that ""Burlesque"" is exactly the kind of movie -- hello ""Flashdance"" -- that back when I was in my teens and early twenties would get massacred by critics and then Id go see it and think it wasnt as bad as theyd all said. But it was. I just hadnt already seen the 20 better versions of the movie from which it stole shamelessly. Go see the 20 better versions. Any backstage musical with Judy Garland; ""Funny Girl"" with Streisand; ""Lady Sings the Blues"" with Diana Ross."" Hell even ""Dream Girls."" Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Comments Burlesque Rated PG-13  116 minutes  2010 Christina Aguilera is an Iowa waitress who shimmies and sings her way to stardom in a fading bump-and-grind nightclub on the Sunset Strip; Cher is the owner and top chanteuse mending costumes when not jousting with the rich developer (Eric Dane of Greys Anatomy) who wants both the club and Aguilera. This slick brassy musical embraces chorus-line cliche raiding everything from Gold Diggers of 1933 to Showgirls; even the dances feel cozily dated as choreographers Denise Faye and Joey Pizzi borrow liberally from Bob Fosse. But the current burlesque revival is a throwback to ostensibly more innocent times and writer-director Steven Antin finds something redemptive in each character (even bad girl Kristen Bell is rewarded with such meaty lines as ""I will not be upstaged by a slut with mutant lungs""). With Stanley Tucci and Alan Cumming.

BOTTOM LINE A movie about stripping thats somehow no fun to watch CAST Christina Aguilera Cher Cam Gigandet Stanley Tucci LENGTH 156 An upbeat tale about a small-town girl who becomes the best stripper in Los Angeles ""Burlesque"" manages what seemed impossible It is filled with half-naked dancing girls yet its still boring. We could ponder its values (Whats that parents? Not the best message you say?) but ""Burlesque"" is too moronic to fret over. Its unlikely to inspire its PG-13 viewers to take feather-dancing classes; theres nothing here they havent seen in a music video anyway. Speaking of which Christina Aguilera plays Ali a cocktail waitress at The Burlesque Lounge who yearns to command its stage. Theres no denying Aguileras roof-raising voice (her acting is another matter) and she is already a kind of modern-day burlesquer as a touring act accustomed to elaborate routines and costume changes. But that also explains why her numbers seem so familiar so unsurprising. Aguilera is an obvious choice - the only kind this film ever makes. advertisement | advertise on newsday Among the others are the lounges mother-hen proprietor (Cher waxen) gay stage manager (Stanley Tucci coasting) and sensitive bartender-musician (Cam Gigandet wretched). Of course the club is in danger of closing; a wealthy developer (Eric Dane) has his eye on it and on Ali. The movie tries to channel Bob Fosses ""Cabaret"" (Alan Cumming redoes his Tony-winning shtick as a salacious emcee) but writer-director Steven Antin a rock-video veteran cant deny his Pussycat Dolls sensibility. Though snicker-worthy at moments ""Burlesque"" doesnt even have the camp potential of a ""Showgirls"" or a ""Dirty Dancing."" Its unfunny unsexy and nearly unwatchable.

The movie has three potential audiences. None will leave empty-handed. None will be truly sated.Musical fans excited to see an all-singing all-dancing rags-to-riches rollercoaster spectacular will probably feel least cheated. With form in music videos and live burlesque debut writer-director Steven Antin knows how to put on a show and mean it. He throws spangly Chicago-style production numbers at the screen like King Kong hurling cars down Fifth Avenue. Connoisseurs of the compellingly bad and/or outrageously camp will find a fair bit to savour notably thudding exposition naff design touches and a nocturnal car-park scene involving Cher a crowbar mutant lungs memories adultery and vomit. But too much of the movie is simply banal or inept. The leads are inert the production design boringly glossy. Crucially the script is devoid of tension badly paced and stuffed with distracting supporting characters of whom only Stanley Tucci reprising his GBF shtick from The Devil Wears Prada is remotely memorable. Worst news for schlock fiends no actual tits no bona-fide bitches.The third potential audience - adolescent girls in search of aspirational escapism - is the crowd to whom the films coy dissembling about the actual nature of burlesque does a real disservice. Even if they admire Aguileras powerful voice this aint the way professional singers are discovered. But there it is try to make Showgirls for 12 year olds and you please no one. What a tease.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Burlesque amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Tangled All Good Things >> Burlesque ""Get your ass up show me how you burlesque"" growls Christina Aguilera in one of this indulgent movies indulgent musical numbers that swagger with pearls glitter and red lipstick--if not grammatical verb usage. Writer-director Steve Antins tarted up a great guilty pleasure that hews to the farm-girl-becomes-a-star framework but adds extra flourishes. Dont judge Burlesque by its cliches--its got em all and who cares. Note Antins extra shimmies Stanley Tuccis scene-stealing turn as the clubs man of costumes and advice the grand entrance of Cher who nails her role as a diva shaded by pride regret and untapped maternalism. Underneath the rhinestones Antins made a character piece with credit due as much to casting as to his script. And hes unrepentant about shoe-horning in moments for his cast to shine; you giggle at the lead-foot obviousness when Cher decides to practice her new ballad ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"" after hours but damned if she doesnt kill it with her warm warbling forte as though with every note shes apologizing for launching Auto-Tune. Kristen Bell is miscast as a sexpot who sees Aguilera as a threat but Aguilera herself is damned decent in a performance that feels tailored to her limitations. Shes no actress--at least not yet--but she can own a stage. Antins smartly crafted her role keeping that voice under wraps from the other characters until halfway through the film. (""How do you do that?"" a fellow dancer gushes. ""It just comes out"" says Aguilera a non-answer so tossed off and true it can only come from someone born with a gift.) But the best move Antin makes is to muss up his heroine. Shes no naif corrupted by the big city; shes a scrapper who gives as good as she gets. Aguilera gets to smile when her successes come at other girls misfortunes to hit back when they get catty. Even her crush (Cam Gigandet) is affianced to another woman giving the mandatory romantic subplot some claws. She and the film around her work for what they want even if we think their goals are cornball.  Like his leading lady does here Antin must have also gone home at night to read stacks of books on burlesque. They might be picture books but effort counts.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 24 2010 Save for later Saved Stanley Tucci (l.) and Cher are shown in a scene from the movie Burlesque. Stephen Vaughan/Screen Gems/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you go to ""Burlesque"" expecting a campy hoot on the order of ""Showgirls"" you may be in for a disappointment. Its not quite awful enough although its plenty bad. Its being promoted as the screen comeback of Cher who plays the owner of a run-down L.A. burlesque house on Sunset Strip but her role is relatively meager. This is unfortunate since she along with Stanley Tucci as her stage manager give the only performances that rise above the level of a high school theatrical.The ostensbile star is Christina Aguilera playing an Iowa waitress who becomes the clubs prime hootchy-kootchy attraction. She belts out her big numbers while scrunching up her kisser and sidestepping the many hurtling bodies that writer-director Steve Antin places in her path. This movie has about as much to do with burlesque as ""Dancing with the Stars"" has to do with ""Swan Lake."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Youd be much better off renting the documentary ""Behind the Burly Q"" or picking up Liz Goldwyns illustrated book ""Pretty Things."" Or maybe you should rent ""Showgirls"" and be done with it.

Written and directed with schoolmarmish timidity by newcomer Steve Antin Burlesque never even goes terribly irretrievably wrong. Its just dishwater dull.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers Holiday Movie Preview Ten Movies for Escapism This Season We lick our lips in anticipation when Aquilera fresh from Iowa gets off the bus in L.A. and leans on club owner Tess (Cher) to make her a star. Alan Cumming the Tony-winning emcee from Cabaret says ""wilkommen"" and the burlesque girls dance in frenetically edited snippets like something out of Chicago. Antin has swallowed those two Broadway-to-Hollywood avatars whole. But what he chokes up is a cinematic hairball. Any movie that reduces Cher to two numbers (while Aquilera belts out what seems like two dozen power ballads) is in trouble. When Aquilera first sings (Etta James ""Tough Lover"") Antin wont let us make up our own minds about her talent. He has the whole cast including Stanley Tucci as the gay stage manager and Cam Gigandet as the straight bartender react with a jaw-dropping awe I havent see since Spielberg landed the mothership in Close Encounters. I laughed out loud intentionally only once when Kristen Bell as Aquileras jealous rival asked Cher what she saw in ""that slut with the mutant lungs."" That line belongs in a better ballsier movie.

"Burlesque is a worthwhile trifle for Cher and Xtina fans. Slate Sign In Sign Up Burlesque is a worthwhile trifle for Cher and Xtina fans. Burlesque is a worthwhile trifle for Cher and Xtina fans. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 23 2010 346 PM You Havent Seen the Last of Cher Burlesque is a worthwhile trifle for Cher and Xtina fans. By Jessica Grose Christina Aguilera (center) in Burlesque A few minutes before a screening of the diva-strewn dance movie Burlesque (Screen Gems) began a woman sat down next to my friend and me and said something in Russian to her two kids who had been holding her seat. About 20 minutes after the movie started she leaned over to us and asked in slightly accented English ""Is this Harry Potter?"" Jessica Grose Jessica Grose is a frequent Slate contributor and the author of the novel Sad Desk Salad. Follow her on Twitter. Though that misinformed Russian lady may have been confused by what she saw on screen (why is Hermione wearing stripper heels?) the rest of the audience got precisely the movie that they had come to see a campy satisfying showcase for the impressively flashy vocal and sartorial stylings of Cher and Christina Aguilera. After Cher performed the soon-to-be adult-contemporary hit ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"" the entire room broke into vigorous applause and screams of joy. Wisely director Steven Antin does not ask either woman to do much stretching in the acting department. Christina is cast as a savvy small-town girl Ali who longs to make it as a singer and dancer in Los Angeles while Cher is the aging burlesque queen and foul-mouthed club owner Tess. Cher has always been aware of the limits of her talent--as she said in a New York Times interview last weekend ""I have a very narrow range ... Ive never tried anything more than playing who I am."" Christina is also essentially playing a version of herself here but shes an easygoing presence during her speaking scenes and truly magnetic when shes singing. This may seem like faint praise for her acting but as my viewing companion Willa Paskin of Vulture pointed out Christinas contemporary Britney Spears was painfully wooden in Crossroads. Being yourself on screen is not as easy as it looks. Advertisement Beyond Tess and Alis fairly developed and sweet bond the plot is pretty thin and occasionally nonsensical. Naturally Tess takes Ali under her bedazzling wing and makes her into a burlesque star. She also fends off a blandly nefarious real estate developer (blandly nefarious Eric Dane) who wants to buy her club demolish it and turn it into a skyscraper. Meanwhile Ali shields herself from a wannabe saboteur fellow-dancer and alcoholic Nikki played by a sadly underused Kristen Bell. As a character Nikki is particularly undercooked which is a shame because Bell has shown real promise playing bitchy in the sadly cancelled TV show Party Down. For starters Nikki seems to have a poor grasp of the passage of time. Late in the film Nikki reminds Tess about how they built the club together and how galling it is that Ali gets to come in and steal Nikkis thunder. Unless thirtysomething Nikki started dancing for sixtysomething Tess while still in diapers the notion that they ""built the club together"" is absurd. However Nikki does get the best line in the movie when she says of Ali ""I will not be upstaged by a slut with mutant lungs"" Ali also has a love interest chiseled burlesque-club bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet) whose only memorable scene involves his naked body and a strategically placed box of cookies. There is also a delightful supporting turn by Stanley Tucci as Tess sidekick and Alis fairy godfather. That Tuccis character is identical to the one he played in The Devil Wears Prada doesnt really matter--you are thrilled see him again. Alan Cumming also makes a brief appearance as a sexually ambiguous host who says things like ""Honey I should wash your mouth out with Jagermeister"" Save for a few zingers like Cummings the dialogue is saccharine and throwaway but it would be foolish to expect Mamet-level patter from this sort of film. The enthralling dance numbers--flashy spectacles with feathers and bras made out of pearls and netting--and the combined sass levels of Cher and Christina Aguilera gloss over the movies weaknesses. Burlesque is unlikely to garner a new fan base for either pop star on this Thanksgiving weekend (good luck trying to convince dad to skip the Cowboys game to see this one) but its a worthwhile trifle for admirers of either icon.

STEPHEN VAUGHAN Christina Aguilera in ""Burlesque"" (Screen Gems) ""Burlesque"" movie poster Confession Ive seen ""Showgirls"" more than once. But the only way Id watch ""Burlesque"" again is if I were trapped on a satellite with my robot friends and forced to watch cheesy movies while scientists monitored my mind.As cheese ""Burlesque"" is a processed American foodstuff pretending to be French. Although the word burlesque is invoked in three different song titles this is not a movie about either the satirical revues of the 19th century or the striptease shows of the 20th. Like ""Flashdance"" its a worn-out show-business fairy tale piggybacking on a nonexistent trend. (Woe to any girl in Iowa who follows the footsteps of our plucky heroine to the bright lights of Sunset Boulevard. The only dance clubs shell find there have stripper poles.)In this alternate reality the swankiest club in Hollywood is a cavernous theater where trained dancers in themed costumes lip-sync smoldering pop songs and execute faux-Fosse dance routines. (Think finger snaps and bowler hats.) Lest we miss the connection to ""Cabaret"" theres an androgynous emcee (Alan Cumming utterly wasted) and a superfluous band of tattooed hipsters playing swing-era instruments. Fresh from the bus corn-fed Ali (Christina Aguilera) finagles a waitressing job from earthy impressario Tess (Cher) and her choreographer confidante Sean (Stanley Tucci). Soon Ali is bunking with hunky bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet) who boosts her confidence while serenading her with synth ballads. And when drunken diva Nikki (Kristen Bell) is late for a performance ambitious Ali gets a chance to strut her stuff. But while Goldilocks is living the dream theres a wolf at the door developer Marcus (Eric Dane) who wants to woo her away from Jack and bulldoze the debt-ridden club for condominiums.This moldy stinker has plenty of holes but in fairness neither the soft-focused Cher nor the genuinely talented Aguilera embarrass themselves particularly when paired with such wimpy men. Yet despite the butt-baring costumes and emphatic songs the group dance routines are unexciting. Director Steve Antin seems more inspired by the Pussycat Dolls the neutered neo-burlesque troupe founded by his sister Robin than by frenetic movie musicals like ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago."" Without pizazz or a point of view ""Burlesque"" is several steps behind the competition and in show business thatll earn you a bus ticket back to Iowa.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 24 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Nov. 23 2010 427PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Falling in the pillowy cleavage between mildly awful and slightly entertaining Burlesque is a cliched rags-to-diva story that culminates in a series of Christina Aguilera videos. Aguilera announces her big-screen debut in the opening sequence when as an Iowa waitress Ali she slips a coin into a jukebox puts a foot on a bar chair and starts belting out Etta Jamess Somethings Got a Hold on Me. She has a pair of giant lungs waiting to take a mighty suck from the great bong of stardom. Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles Ali wanders into a time-warp dive known as the Burlesque Lounge where she sees her onstage future. Apparently its a drag revue with heavily made-up dancers in sparkly lingerie striking poses and lip-synching to old tunes. Theres even a stone-faced Cher impersonator named Tess (whos actually played by Cher). But heres director-writer Steve Antins ingenious innovation The performers are improbably young women. Otherwise Burlesque steals liberally from Cabaret the Weimar oom-pah music playing when Ali first enters the club Alan Cumming as the Joel Grey-like emcee and male bartenders (including Alis love interest Cam Gigandet) dressed in Sally Bowles costumes. Substituting for the looming Nazi threat is Eric Dane as a suave real-estate agent trying to buy the indebted club. Can Ali overcome her back-stabbing rival Nikki (Kristen Bell)? And can Tess and her gay pillar of support Sean (Stanley Tucci) save their club? Could anyone possibly care? The important thing is each setback provides another opportunity for Aguilera (and occasionally Cher) to step in the spotlight and wail.

Wing and a prayer people The story A small-town girl arrives in Los Angeles with dreams of stardom only to wind up singing at a burlesque lounge. Starring Cher Christina Aguilera Eric Dane Cam Gigandet Julianne Hough Peter Gallagher Alan Cumming Kristen Bell Stanley Tucci Director Steve Antin Running time 140 Release Opened Nov 24 2010  Editorial Review A dynamic duo Sing it sisters. By Ann Hornaday Friday November 26 2010 The first genuine showstopper in the musical ""Burlesque"" is a brassy bawdy anthem called ""Welcome to Burlesque"" a valentine to pure camp made all the more exhilarating in that it marks Chers return to the big screen after a too-long seven-year hiatus. Granted this uneven but infectiously cheery movie is clearly designed around Chers co-star the 29-year-old pop star Christina Aguilera who in her feature film debut bumps and grinds and shimmies and belts her way to certain stardom. But ""Burlesque"" also offers a case study in what has made the 64-year-old Cher such a captivating and enduring presence a star of the glitzy old school who could scandalize Hollywood with a gloriously tacky Oscar gown - and deservedly win the award. (That youll recall was for ""Moonstruck"" a lovely romance that featured just one of several stunning serious acting turns for Cher throughout the 1980s.) In her eye-popping opening number and later in a surprisingly affecting power ballad Cher proves that she can still belt but more to the point she can still act. This corny guilty pleasure of a movie is a fitting two-hander for these seasoned pros. Aguilera plays the young ambitious singer-dancer Ali Rose who teeters out of her Iowa trailer park to make it big in Hollywood. While roaming the Sunset Strip she comes under the wise - and really well cosmeticized - tutelage of Chers Tess who runs the Burlesque Lounge a fading temple of rococo excess and tatty retro glamour. First-time writer-director Steve Antin will never be accused of breaking new ground with ""Burlesque."" But even within an otherwise predictable string of stock scenes and awkwardly staged montages Cher can be counted on to deliver ""Burlesques"" most poignant and funny moments. And more often than not those moments occur when shes trading wearily affectionate banter with Stanley Tucci who plays Sean Tesss longtime stage manager and gay boyfriend with his usual deadpan humor and sensitivity. Aguilera whose throaty blues-inflected voice has always stood out from the Autotuned bubblegum of her peers gets to show off her prodigious range and vintage taste in ""Burlesque"" where she struts her diminutive frame in progressively more bedazzling - and revealing - costumes. With pipes and well-honed showmanship like hers its no surprise that Aguilera completely nails the movies production numbers. As an actress Aguileras understandably a bit more unsteady. Her newcomers uncertainty fits Alis own fledgling self-awareness but it remains to be seen whether Aguilera can become the multi-hyphenate on par with her co-star. Certainly her lack of experience helps explain why of the two power-ballad solos in ""Burlesque"" Chers ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"" lands with such powerful force. Written by the great Diane Warren the song is Chers ""Im Not Going"" moment a mirror image of the resilience autonomy and sheer chops she has come to represent. When Cher/Tess sighs ""Lets get this over with"" before the song her reluctance is obviously pure hooey the kind of Hollywood artifice that ""Burlesque"" celebrates without a trace of irony. Whats more it provides welcome respite from the films chief flaw which is Antins penchant for a constantly moving camera and whipsaw editing. There must be good dancing in ""Burlesque"" but too much of it gets lots in a Cuisinarted welter of swish pans and jump cuts. ""What happened to all the great dancers in L.A.?"" Tess asks Sean at one point. ""Theyre on Dancing With the Stars"" he quips. And look Theres one now ""DWTSs"" own Julianne Hough plays one of Tesss dancers as does Kristen Bell who engages in ""Burlesques"" most picturesque catfights. Alan Cumming nodding coyly to his own breakout performance in ""Cabaret"" is shamefully underused as the clubs heavily guylined doorman-slash-bouncer although we see plenty of Cam Gigandet as Jack the Burlesques cute bartender and Alis (mostly) chaste love interest. As a musical a backstage coming-of-age drama and an ingenues burstingly assured star turn ""Burlesque"" proves a worthy addition to those canons landing on the respectable side of the ""42nd Street""-""Showgirls"" spectrum. But it succeeds most as one generations transfer of pop-culture wealth to another. ""Remember"" Tess advises one of her dancers ""if you fall off the stage legs extended boobs out."" That might as well be Chers motto for life the watchwords of a consummate professional who knows that to survive every diva needs a dash of self-deprecation. ""Burlesque"" delivers eyeful after eyeful of rapid-fire opulence and spectacle. But its most memorable sight is the indelible image of one star taking flight and another triumphantly staying put. Contains sexual content including several suggestive dance routines partial nudity profanity and thematic material.

Photo Cher -- or quite possibly a replica of the Oscar-winning actress from Madame Tussauds -- mentors aspiring singer-stripper Christina Aguilera in the silly curiously unsexy musical ""Burlesque."" As Ali an Iowa waitress with showbiz ambitions Aguilera has quite a set of pipes -- as Chers self-described ""wise old fairy godmother"" Tess hilariously puts it ""This chick doesnt sing that way because shes had it easy"" Aguilera can dance like nobodys business but her acting debut isnt going to keep Anne Hathaway awake at night. PHOTOS MUSICIANS IN MOVIES Though the film clocks in at two hours the plot is skimpier than the costumes. Perky Ali waiting tables at LAs Burlesque Lounge wears down Tess the kindly but skeptical owner and replaces a pregnant colleague played by ""Dancing With the Stars"" winner Julianne Hough. Soon Alis big voice has enabled her to edge out the clubs resident diva (Kristen Bell) who exclaims ""Shes just a tacky farm girl from Iowa"" By this point Ali has unwisely become involved with the divas boyfriend a developer (Eric Dane) who wants to tear down the club and replace it with a luxury high-rise. Not that theres a moment of doubt that Tess and her long-suffering aide-de-camp (Stanley Tucci) will keep the club which her ex-hubby (Peter Gallagher) wants her to sell. Nor that Ali will end up with her roommate (Cam Gigandet of ""Twilight"") -- an aspiring songwriter. Those looking for another ""Showgirls"" will be disappointed -- writer-director Steve Antin avoids the seamy side of the business and the same-sex flirtation is mostly between guys. The choreography is roughly a cross between the costume-fetish flourishes of ""Cabaret"" and the writhing deployed in the movie version of ""Nine"" minus the latters pretensions. Though shes absent for long periods ""Burlesque"" belongs to Cher who sings two numbers (including ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"" which sounds a lot like a threat) and is photographed under such heavy diffusion that when Aguilera is in the same shot her features threaten to disappear altogether.

Burlesque (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Burlesque (PG-13) Christina Aguilera displays acting chops and Cher shows off her Botox Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald11/24/2010 Editor rating 3 After they have achieved a certain level of stardom many pop stars decide to give movies a try with varying degrees of success. Some like Mandy Moore or Justin Timberlake are able to act without relying on a musical crutch. Others like Britney Spears or Madonna quickly realize film is not their forte and move on. In Burlesque a singer who successfully crossed over into acting -- the Oscar-winning Cher -- teams up with movie newcomer Christina Aguilera. Cher gets top billing on the films posters (and for the first time in her career gets to sing onscreen) but shes really playing a supporting character here Tess the owner of a Los Angeles burlesque club where female dancers perform and lip-sync to recorded music. Written and directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Steve Antin Burlesque is really a showcase for Aguilera. Playing Ali from Iowa who moves to California and gets a job waitressing at Tess joint Aguilera holds her own fairly well in her dialogue scenes. But after shes promoted to performer Aguilera gets to strut her stuff in musical numbers that take full advantage of her powerful voice and dancing skills (my favorite bit the song she sings wearing a dress consisting entirely of pearl necklaces). Reminiscent of Showgirls minus the sex nudity sleaze bad acting and horrible dancing Burlesque is a typical A Star is Born story. Ali gets an All About Eve-ish rival in Nikki (Kristen Bell) who doesnt appreciate all the attention the new girl is getting. She finds a potential boyfriend in Jack (Cam Gigandet) a waiter at the club. She is wooed by a rich businessman (Eric Dane) the sort of guy who doesnt brag about his fortunes. And she relies on the assistance of Sean (Stanley Tucci) the clubs costume designer for career and personal advice. No one would ever call Burlesque original but the movie is remarkable for its utter lack of traditional villains. The characters are all hugely appealing even the ones you might expect to be playing on Dr. Evils team. Gigandet so often cast as bullies and bad guys (Twilight Never Back Down) reveals a surprisingly sweetness as a romantic leading man (his scenes opposite Aguilera are among the films best). Bell makes Nikkis jealousy understandable She has nothing against Ali; she just likes having the spotlight. Chers performance is limited by a distracting amount of Botox and cosmetic surgery -- the only things that move on her face are her eyes and lips -- so she never quite disappears into the role of the cabaret owner trying to stave off bank repossession but she does make the best of her two songs proving her voice remains as strong as ever. Curiously Burlesque never gives Cher and Aguilera the seemingly obvious duet (there were rumors on the set that the two didnt always get along). But although you cant really tell if Aguilera is quite ready to carry a dramatic role she more than excels as the hugely talented singer and dancer who helps put the fading cabaret back on the map. Burlesque is exceedingly well shot and edited -- some of the musical numbers are knockouts -- and it emits an upbeat pleasant vibe that carries you right past its plentiful cliches. Best you dont even have to know the title of one of Aguileras pop hits to appreciate her performance In case there was ever any doubt Burlesque proves the girls got talent.

Photo Stephen Vaughan AP Image 12 of 12 Burlesque review Aguilera takes off 1 / 12 Back to Gallery Burlesque Musical. Starring Christina Aguilera Cher and Stanley Tucci. Directed by Steve Antin. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Burlesque"" is irresistible from its first minutes and over time it creates a whole atmosphere not only onscreen but within the audience. Its big perfectly cast and entertaining in every way but more than that it feels like a generous public event. See it with other people. See it with a crowd. You will know youre in good hands 30 seconds into meeting Christina Aguilera as a small-town girl who dreams of big-city glamour. Aguilera has the face of an actress full of character and thought and in this her first screen role she has an ease with dialogue that some people never achieve. Only when she opens her mouth to sing would anyone peg her as a pop star. Her deep booming voice shakes the theaters sound system as Chers name flashes on the opening credits and were off - to about as good a time as anybodys going to have this year sitting down. ""Burlesque"" is an amalgam of strains and elements from dozens of movie musicals Theres the club that could exist nowhere on earth. There are dance numbers that could never really happen. Theres a paid staff of showgirls. Theres a scary brunette diva and a young woman whos going out there a child and coming back a star. Theres also a burgeoning talent who must choose between a rich guy and a nice guy - alas they are never ever the same guy. Some will recognize these motifs from ""Showgirls"" or ""Flashdance"" but to see these as cliches would be missing the point. ""Burlesque"" is operating within a whole musical tradition with stuff in it literally going back to ""The Broadway Melody"" from 1929. The point is not that its possible to piece together a musical out of leftover parts like Frankenstein but rather that the old can become new again when re-imagined for a new era and invested with enthusiasm and feeling. Lets say something about Cher right away or else people will start looking for the Cher paragraph. Shes wonderful in this. Over the years she has done things with (and to) her face that make it difficult to cast her in a wide range of roles. But here as a veteran singer and dancer who owns a struggling nouveau burlesque club in Los Angeles everything about her look and self-presentation becomes a virtue. As befits a legend the role and Cher seem to overlap. We watch both of them appreciating the no-nonsense motherly warmth behind the glitz with a growing conviction that were seeing some original and very showbiz variety of a great woman. The club in ""Burlesque"" has nothing to do with traditional burlesque. Aside from a single chaste fan dance the programs consist of production numbers performed by showgirls who dance and lip-sync. Only Cher as the owner sings in her own voice - she has two numbers; her second the ballad ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"" is what could be called ""the song from the show."" Later Aguilera also gets to sing. The soundtrack contains originals as well as such nods to the past as ""A Guy What Takes His Time"" which was hot stuff when it premiered in the Mae West film ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933). As performed by Aguilera its not exactly cold stuff now. Four years ago Jennifer Hudson became a star and deserved to become a star after stopping the show exactly once in ""Dreamgirls."" In ""Burlesque"" Aguilera is jaw-droppingly good in several numbers. Moreover she makes us believe in this aspiring performers talent in her consuming need to succeed and in her essential worth as a person. The script was never going to earn writer-director Steve Antin a Nobel Prize but its cleverer than it has to be. Right out of the box Aguilera knows how to listen to her fellow actors to react and be spontaneous and it makes all the difference. Good people surround her. In addition to Cher theres Stanley Tucci as the nice gay man who mediates between the owner (Cher) and her new star in much the same way he mediated as a nice gay man between Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Kristen Bell brings force and subtle comedy to her role as a Burlesque diva who feels her star slipping and doesnt like it. Unfortunately the multi-talented Alan Cumming has little to do even though this would seem to be his natural environment. And then it ends two minutes before it might have started to sag. Antin doesnt belabor the story. He cuts strings and dashes for the finish - just in time for the massive dance number that sends people out with a spring in their step and the energy to rejoin a world that for two hours theyd completely forgotten. -- Advisory Suggestive dance numbers sexual situation adult subjects.

The heroine of the musical Burlesque walks into a Sunset Boulevard nightclub where scantily clad women are gyrating onstage and Alan Cumming is manning the cash register. ""Is this a strip club?"" Ali asks. Cumming looks appalled. ""I should wash your mouth out with Jagermeister"" he says fluttering his eyelashes. Then Tess (Cher) the clubs owner and resident diva struts out onto the stage as imposing and stiff as a stilt walker and belts out a number called ""Welcome to the Burlesque."" Musically its not quite Cabarets ""Willkommen"" but for an orphaned aspiring showgirl in need of a mother-mentor figure its a dream introduction. By this films standards the main criteria for burlesque seems to be looking good in undies and knowing where your breasts are so you can grab them every 30 seconds or so. Tess is the only performer who actually sings (Cher has two numbers). The rest including the mean mini-diva Nikki (Kristen Bell) lip-sync to the classics. Ali doesnt get a role onstage but she does manage to wrangle a waitressing job out of Tess -- which allows her to watch the show and learn all the numbers. This means that often as shes moving about the club shes simultaneously making spastic little flourishes with her hand practicing dance moves waiting for a chance to wow everyone. Ordering anything in a martini glass from this girl would be risky. (See the top 10 movies that shouldnt have made it to Broadway.) The movie is frivolous fun but not as I had sort of hoped as sinfully awful as Showgirls Mariah Careys Glitter or Britney Spears Crossroads. Lacking the snap of Chicago or the insane creativity of Moulin Rouge its a middle-of-the-road musical. While it took my eyes an hour to recover from the chronic soft focus required to make the naturally vampy Aguilera look like an angelic Breck girl Burlesque doesnt have the kind of stunning bad taste that calls for the immediate invention of a drinking game built around it. Aguilera making her dramatic debut is far from a great actress but compared to Elizabeth Berkley or Spears she is a veritable Nicole Kidman. And in Burlesque she is propped up by three of the most fun people in show business Cumming Cher and Stanley Tucci who plays the clubs gay (of course) costume designer Sean. None of them are going home with an Oscar but writer-director Steve Antin has written to their comic strengths and personas -- Chers sarcasm Cummings naughtiness and Tuccis gift for being snarky and good-natured. The results while occasionally forced are consistently amusing. (""What happened to all the great dancers?"" Tess grumbles to Sean during an audition. ""Theyre all dancing with the stars"" he says.) (See TIMEs Summer Entertainment Preview 2010.) What the movie does have in common with Glitter et al is the problem of trying to convince an audience that the adult heroine -- Aguilera is about to turn 30 -- famous to all of us really could be an undiscovered novice or for that matter an innocent. Actually Burlesque faces a bigger challenge. Aguilera might not be to your taste or mine (the musical numbers are lively but produced no urge to sing in the shower) but in terms of sheer power shes impressive -- a far bigger vocal talent than a Spears for example. If Ali were real shed have already been discovered on American Idol. Antins solution is to run a bulldozer right over that obstacle and others (Bell cant dance? Shoot her from the waist up). During the opening credits Ali alone in a dive bar in Iowa launches into Etta James ""Somethings Got a Hold on Me."" Fully amplified and laughable in its professionalism the number instantly establishes that we have no need to fret about Alis future. Its lulling the narrative equivalent of Muzak. The rest of the movie follows suit unfolding predictably but pleasantly. At Burlesque Ali meets her primary love interest right off the bat Jack the bartender (Cam Gigandet a young Brad Pitt type) and is soon sleeping on his couch in tantalizing proximity. Jack is engaged but his fiancee is conveniently out of town. (Watch TIMEs video ""The 2008 New York Burlesque Festival."") In addition to finding fame and true love theres also surprisingly a subplot involving the national real estate crisis. Tess and her ex-husband Burlesques co-owner Vince (the completely unnecessary Peter Gallagher) are facing foreclosure which means we get to hear Cher grumbling about balloon payments. The local sleazy real estate mogul Marcus (Eric Dane) wants to buy Tess out but she refuses. Alis talent might bring in the punters and save the day unless shes seduced by Marcus who comes bearing glittering Louis Vuitton shoes and an opportunity to meet big-time producers. Should we be worried shell let the club down? Not in this carefully cushioned star vehicle. ""That one there"" Sean says gesturing at Ali ""shes beautiful on the inside as well.""

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday November 24 2010 400 AM Title Burlesque A nightclub owner mentors a young dancer. With Cher Christina Aguilera. Director Steve Antin (154). PG-13 Sexuality language partial nudity. At area theaters.How bad does ""Burlesque"" want to be? After all any movie that opens with jazz hands stripper heels and an ambitious ingenue walking out on her waitressing job cant possibly be aiming for originality. And at first it seems that director Steve Antin is in on his own joke playing up the cliches and campiness for all theyre worth. But as the movie drags on -- and on -- we start to wonder Did he actually set out to make another ""Showgirls""? Or was he really hoping to hit the big time?Outsized dreams spur Christina Aguileras Ali who leaves Iowa to work in an L.A. nightclub run by Tess (Cher) and Sean (Stanley Tucci). Stuck serving drinks Ali desperately wants to be on stage in the neo-burlesque numbers Tess choreographs. When a pregnant dancer (Julianne Hough) retires Ali finally gets her break impressing the cute bartender (Cam Gigandet) but infuriating the clubs star (Kristen Bell).Unfortunately Ali has more to worry about than a catty co-worker. The bank is about to foreclose on Tess mortgage and Alis slick new boyfriend (Eric Dane) plans to raze the club.Since Antin didnt put much effort into his script he must have counted on the concept to sell itself. And to a certain degree it does There always will be room for movies with dueling divas and dialogue like ""I will not be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs"" And though the director falls short of his ""Cabaret"" dreams -- Alan Cumming cameo aside -- the burlesque numbers are energetic jolts sparked by fabulous costumes and slick choreography.Though any Oscar winner with Chers tenacity and talent deserves better she and Tucci are smart enough to embrace their outlandish surroundings. Everyone else plays things painfully straight so while Aguilera doesnt embarrass herself in her feature debut she doesnt shine either.Sure sometimes its fun to be assaulted by sequins wigs corsets and retro homage. But Xtinas fans can find all that already -- in videos ranging from ""Lady Marmalade"" to ""Aint No Other Man"" -- without having to sit through two hours of recycled plots and plastic acting.

"Movie review Burlesque - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review BurlesqueIts showtime all the time in this film about a dance club starring power vocalists Christina Aguilera Cher and any number of dancers and razzle-dazzle costumes.November 24 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Think of ""Burlesque"" as one ginormous music video theme party thrown by Christina Aguilera with Cher in the house plus boas bustiers and dancing girls and about a thousand humongous Broadway-style showstoppers. Which is a far better way to consider ""Burlesque"" than thinking of it as a movie a there words fail. (Their words not mine. Im a long way from finished here.) But should you find yourself in the mood for Big Musical Numbers by the score rather than a film theres a lot to like about ""Burlesque."" Anyone whos listened to Top 40 radio in the last decade has no doubt been blown away by Aguileras powerful pipes and wide vocal range that puts her in Whitney Houston territory. Shes pure pleasure to listen to for a while. The singing-songwriting pop phenom is a cutting-edge maestro of the music video too. She was creating provocative pomp and circumstance extravaganzas long before Lady Gaga was saying ""gaga."" (OK that might be a slight exaggeration.) ""Burlesque"" then is a safe place for Aguilera to show off her song and dance chops. And that she does belting out bluesy songs left and right many inspired by that smoldering torch queen Etta James while bumping and grinding around the stage with other pretties for roughly two hours straight. Whew. Its a visual feast of feathers and rhinestones and pearls that makes you want to use words like razzle-dazzle amazing when talking about costume designer Michael Kaplan. Shot with a gorgeous lushness by Bojan Bazelli (""Hairspray"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") the entire world of ""Burlesque"" evokes an earlier vaudevillian era. But its not set way back then. A ghastly ""Dancing With the Stars"" line lets you know that ""Burlesque"" is taking place ""now"" as does the mega real estate development thats putting the old L.A. clubs fate on the line. Writer-director Steven Antin making his feature film debut has borrowed the oldest story in the Hollywood book. Young girl from Iowa or somewhere in the American middle a so shes blond a comes to Tinseltown to find fame and fortune. First she will face hard times then find a big-city cheese to woo her (Eric Danes Marcus) a sweet Kentucky farm boy to maybe love her ( Cam Gigandets Jack) and an aging diva (Chers Tess) who will take her under her wing. And when she finally gets her shot at the big time a why gosh that girl can sing. The film begins back in the heartland with Aguileras little orphan Ali taking cash from the register in the diner just enough to cover what shes owed. But before she packs up and heads to the bus depot theres that stage in the corner of the diner that beckons.a| Once in L.A Ali hits the streets looking for work and ends up on the Sunset Strip where the neon Burlesque sign calls her in from the night. ""Is this a strip club?"" she asks blinking those baby blues at the guy in the ticket booth played by Alan Cumming. To wit he answers that the only pole in here is Natasha (or Svetlana or something equally cringe-worthy). Before you know it Alis chatting up that hunky Kentucky wonder who happens to bartend at the club grabbing a tray and serving drinks and vowing to convince Tess that she ought to be on the stage. The filmmaker is apparently not only into borrowing plots but recycling too since so many lines get reused like ""dont call me Maam"" (thats Tess) ""dont touch my stuff"" (thats Kristen Bells Nikki the young starlet who drinks too much is always late has a bad attitude and is about to be replaced by Ali) and ""thats just the kind of friend I am"" (Jack and Ali do multiple readings of that one clearly a keeper). Its a shame because if youve ever seen ""Moonstruck"" ""Silkwood"" or ""Mask"" to name a few you know that Cher can act something shes never pressed to do here. Meanwhile it will take more than ""Burlesque"" to know whether Aguilera will ever be able to make the transition. Now when it comes to Stanley Tucci its another story. Truthfully I cant remember anything he says though there was some warning about an expiration date on milk or maybe that was love but God bless him that man can read a phone book and make you feel the pathos. As Tess main confidant and best friend stage manager Sean hes tangy and tart and the only one youd want to take home (though possibly Jack too but just because hes so pretty). On the story front things unfold exactly as you would guess not one surprise squeezed in anywhere no matter how hard you look. But with Aguilera and Cher center stage there shouldnt have been any vocal issues to contend with. And yeta| As much as I love the seductive low rumble that Cher still commands (and I will pay good money to see her in her latest Final Concert Tour of which I think there have been three thus far) and while Ill take a jolt of Aguilera in the morning over Red Bull every time any world-class singer knows you dont keep the volume blasting and the beat rocking hard the whole time. It is a tip they should have shared with their director a one that might have led him to add shadings and nuance a quiet ballad here and there a moment or two with no spangle-y things to distract you. But no ""Burlesque"" is top-heavy from start to finish. Maybe thats what you do when you have nothing new to say. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESChristina Aguilera hopes Hollywood leads to the road backNovember 21 2010Burlesque went through bumps and grinds to make it to the...November 13 2010The Costumes BurlesqueOctober 31 2010L.A.s a hot spot for burlesqueOctober 10 2010Gala Aims to Keep L.A. on Its Toes by Bringing Dance Back...June 27 2000MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewChristina AguileraNot_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-burlesque-20101124,0,4486495.story",200,burlesque18,burlesque,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Apparently its time for the second round of Depression Musicals. A competent buoyant busy showbiz fantasy ""Burlesque"" taps into the escapist mindset of FDR-era song-and-dance epics following its heroine from grubbing for tips in an Iowa diner to basking in spotlights and applause as Hollywoods cabaret queen. In an age of ever-increasing economic inequality -- unhappy days are here again -- who can blame audiences for wanting to forget the headlines and dream a little? The film is a feel-good Cinderella story yet it frequently confronts our current grim realities. When we meet Christina Aguileras Ali slaving away in a greasy spoon she cant even get her surly manager to pony up last months salary; shes reduced to raiding the cash register to buy a bus ticket to L.A. Desperate times make desperate women. Once Ali arrives on Sunset Boulevard shes mesmerized by the tatty glamour of the Burlesque Lounge a vaudeville joint run with steely resolve by owner/choreographer/den mother Tess (Cher). Alis dreams are on the verge of coming true as she insinuates her way onstage. But Tess is about to become another foreclosure statistic as she dodges bank threats and pressure from her ex-husband Vince (Peter Gallagher) to sell while they still can. Playboy real estate developer Marcus (Eric Dane) is dangling a fat check in front of them but Tess cant bear the thought of life away from the limelight. Stories of this sort play out with a kabuki-like formality. Naturally Marcus will be smitten with Ali introducing her to a life of glittering parties and elite influential friends. But while her head tells her the tycoon would be a favorable match her heart inclines in the direction of Jack (Cam Gigandet) the theaters bartender who gallantly gave the newcomer a place to crash in his apartment until she could find lodgings. The rivals woo her Marcus with pricey Christian Louboutin heels and Jack with his songwriting and low-budget charm. If Ali were merely a showgirl on the hunt for a sugar daddy there wouldnt be much of a movie. She has secret weapons -- a sharp mind stage presence and a great voice -- and she handles them expertly. ""Burlesque"" is structured around a series of wacky grandiose production numbers that erupt onscreen like explosions in a sequin factory. Its a wise choice to keep Aguilera singing rather than acting. Her larynx is a lot more expressive than her face. The same goes for Cher who at this stage in her mummification looks like a PSA on the paralytic effects of Botox. Her scenes are so dimly lit that theaters should be hawking night-vision goggles. Her pipes are as good as ever though. The acting responsibilities in the film are carried by the ever-reliable Stanley Tucci exuding warmth and wisdom as the shows gay costumer. Not as bad as ""Showgirls"" but not nearly as good as ""Chicago"" ""Burlesque"" hits its marks and high-kicks its way offstage just before it gets the hook.

ABOUT THE MOVIEBurlesque  out of fourStarsChristina Aguilera Cher Stanley Tucci Julianne HoughDirector Steve Antin|Distributor Sony/Screen GemsRating PG-13 for sexual content including several suggestive dance routines partial nudity language and some thematic material.Running time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Youd be hard-pressed to find two more distinct singing talents than Cher and Christina Aguilera. But their film Burlesque doesnt provide them much of a backup band. Instead it bristles with exuberant numbers that strain beneath the weight of cliche. Musicals may enjoy greater leeway than other genres but this tale of a cow-town girl who dreams of making it big pushes even Hollywood believability. TRAILER Watch a stripped-down version of Burlesque Ali (Aguilera) is an Iowa waitress who decides to leave her job in a dusty bar and hop a bus to L.A. -- after belting out an Etta James cover. She arrives in Los Angeles to find the Burlesque Lounge a Sunset Strip club that offers innocent smut; just a few peeks of flesh beneath black lingerie smiles and show tunes. Club owner Tess (Cher) is late on her mortgage and could use an unsung talent to fill the seats. The paper-thin premise is enough to warrant the films musical numbers which are plentiful and catchy although few are memorable. Theres no denying the stratospheric range of Aguileras voice and Chers stoic-but-thunderous delivery is still mesmerizing. But Burlesque is marbled with stories that serve only to pad the film to its 100-minute running time. Theres brooding handsome bartender Jack (Twilights Cam Gigandet) who has the hots for Ali but a shrill fiancee in New York. Marcus (Eric Dane) is the brooding handsome playboy with ill intentions for the club. And like a lot of singers looking to be actors Aguilera emotes more on stage than on set. Shes clearly not as at ease in front of a camera as Cher or Stanley Tucci the Devil Wears Prada co-star who is making a career out of playing the patient yin to his divas yang. Tucci is great and underused and Cher acquits herself nicely in her first film role in seven years. But writer/director Steve Antin has his stars sashaying between dance numbers with little narrative thread. We know Ali is an orphan but for a lead character shes sketchily drawn. Aguilera lacks nothing for effort and shes supported by a talented group. But even with those seasoned voices Burlesque remains slightly off-key.

"Burlesque review You will not have a gay old time at tired nightclub |       NJ.com comments Burlesque review You will not have a gay old time at tired nightclub Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 24 2010 at 809 AM View/Post Comments STEPHEN VAUGHANStanley Tucci and Cher star in ""Burlesque"" about a veteran performer and her nightclub business. Fifty-odd years ago Tallulah Bankhead starred in a revival of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" -- a production so crammed full of camp that it was said straight men were struck gay simply passing the theater. ""Burlesque"" may have the reverse effect. It has Cher. It has Alan Cumming. It has Stanley Tucci channeling Eve Arden. It has backstage bitchery romantic entanglements and Christina Aguilera in enough marabou to choke the Folies Bergere. And the whole things so safe so straight so completely anti-fabulous it could put Elton John in gray flannel. Starring the nearly lifelike Cher as Tess proprietor of the worlds oddest burlesque joint the movie follows Christina Aguilera as she flees Iowa for a new life in Los Angeles. Shes got dreams you see. And shes got legs. And boy shes got pipes. Or as one jealous chorine puts it shes ""a slut with mutant lungs"" Movie Review Burlesque (PG-13) Screen Gems (116 min.) Directed by Steven Antin. With Cher Christina Aguilera Stanley Tucci. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains suggestive situations brief nudity alcohol abuse and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS She knows how to use them too. Which is why one fateful night she overcomes the objections of Tess (and the connivances of her own personal ""All About Eve"" schemer) to belt out a song that wows the audience. But can she help save the club from an evil developer? Oh please. If this plot were any more transparent one of the girls would be wearing it. Unfortunately none of it is particularly enjoyable. We see Aguilera studying books on burlesque and mooning over a snapshot of Lili St. Cyr but the film doesnt give a clear idea of what old burlesque (or even ""new"" burlesque) means. The theater itself seems like a wild uneven mix of tattered Broadway elegance overpriced bottle service and bits of ""Cabaret."" The talent (so-called) does a lot of posing while lip-synching to other peoples songs. There are no comics. There is barely any striptease. There are songs though. Boy are there songs. STEPHEN VAUGHANChristina Aguilera center gets a chance to belt out sexy songs in ""Burlesque"" as the newcomer to the business. Although theres nothing nearly as sexy here as her ""Live With Me"" duet with Mick Jagger in ""Shine a Light"" at least Aguilera can still rattle the rafters. So can Cher bless her although at this point her face is so immobile it seems in search of a totem pole. But their numbers are no more memorable than the tired script or cardboard characters. Youve heard of movies that are so bad theyre good? Well this is so bad its . . . bad. But then director Steven Antin -- whos done videos for those other faux foxes the Pussycat Dolls -- doesnt have any sense of wicked fun. Not only can you not laugh with the film its a struggle to even get up the energy to laugh at it. (Although lines such as ""You threw up everything but your memories"" will certainly tempt you.) ""Its a guilty pleasure"" I heard someone say afterward. Well not exactly. It could have been. But first they would have had to remember to put some pleasure into it.

Burlesque Bad to fair Director Steve Antin. Cast Christina Aguilera Cher Eric Dane. Rating PG-13 for sexual content including several suggestive dance routines partial nudity language and some thematic material. Movie strippers | Dance movies Spotlight Stanley Tucci | Christina Aguilera Aguilera hopes to hit high note in Burlesque The bad news - its not interesting enough to be a disaster. Its Aguileras first time acting in a film and how does the old joke go? As an actress shes quite a singer. But that last bit is no joke - as one character says Aguilera has ""mutant lungs"" and in ""Burlesque"" director and screenwriter Steve Antin makes the most of them. He just doesnt do much else with the film. Ali is a waitress in Iowa as the movie begins. But shes got big plans as evidenced by the song-and-dance number she belts out in the empty restaurant. Soon shes in Los Angeles where she wanders into the Burlesque Lounge a nightclub owned and run by Tess (Cher) who occasionally performs herself but mostly worries about losing the in-the-red club to the bank. Anyone hoping for a diva showdown will be disappointed. Ali basically wills herself onstage at Burlesque and Tess while dubious at first becomes Alis biggest supporter - especially when Alis singing and dancing (everyone else but Tess lip-synchs) starts packing the place. For competition Ali has Nikki (Kristen Bell) a drunken arrogant sort who doesnt like being elbowed out of the spotlight. Alas nothing much comes of that show-biz trope either. And just when you think there is no hackneyed love story dont fret. For this we have Jack (Cam Gigandet) a songwriting bartender at the club who lets Ali move into his apartment when hers is broken into. Hes engaged but his fiancee is in New York. If only he could meet a woman who spoke to his soul more deeply. So yes weve ticked off nearly every movie cliche. (Gay best friend for Tess? Bet you thought I left that out. Stanley Tucci is delightful in that role as he is in most.) Will Ali fall for calculating real-estate developer Marcus (Eric Dane) who wants to buy out Tess and her pulling-out-his-hair ex-husband (Peter Gallagher ridiculous)? Or will she stay loyal to the club to Jack to her Midwestern roots? Thats more or less a rhetorical question. There are no unseen developments here just a predictable story occasionally interrupted by increasingly lavish song-and-dance numbers. That they are the highlight is no surprise. That Antin seems interested in little else is.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr SHOWGIRL TOO? Christina Aguilera vamps it up in Burlesque (Stephen Vaughan) C- Burlesque Starring Christina Aguilera Cher; Director Steven Antin; Release Date Wide 11/24/2010; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted November 24 2010 -- 1200 AM EST Earnestly ersatz down to every spangle dance move plot turn and line of hokum dialogue Burlesque is a showbiz pic for these American Idol times -- a time when we agree to pretend that mediocre mimicry of better artists is good enough to keep us entertained. We agree to pretend that quality is in the eye and ear of the undemanding beholder. We agree that life is a cabaret that camp trumps criticism and that the sight of 64-year-old Cher in corset glitter and full kabuki make-up is its own reward. On this last point at least you?ll hear no argument from me. As for the rest maybe Burlesque will serve as the imitation goods that spurs a consumer revolution for something more authentic. Aw who am I kidding? It won?t. A crockpot-stew of leftovers from famous song-and-dance tales including Cabaret Showgirls 42nd Street Chicago Glee and Dancing With the Stars the movie introduces Ali (Christina Aguilera) a wide-eyed blond go-getter who when she?s not waiting tables in a small-town bar in Dullsville Iowa gyrates and sings in a big Aguilera voice and dreams of following her bliss to Los Angeles. So she packs her curling iron boards a bus arrives in the City of Angels and almost immediately clamps mascara-ed eyes on The Burlesque Lounge. What are the odds that Cher would be there as Tess the proprietor/headliner/glitzy mama grizzly? That having wisely saved his eyeliner from Cabaret on Broadway Alan Cumming would find new use for gender-bending eyebrow waggles as the theater?s winking ticket-taker and host? And that Ali would in short order bag a job as a waitress then as a dancer then as a singer then as a showstopper then as the new girl in town who simultaneously charms a handsome insecure musician/bartender with good values (Cam Gigandet) and a handsome over-secure real estate magnate with bad values (Eric Dane)? Heck what are the gay-dream odds that the husband of La Streisand herself -- James Brolin -- would show up for a cameo? In Burlesque never bet against the house. (Never count out the possibility of barking out a laugh where none was intended either.) The relationship between Ali and her bartender beau is for the most part as old-fashioned as that of virginal teens sharing an ice cream cone. The showgirls bend like flexi-straws and wiggle their fannies but eroticism is safely off the table. Reusing his own shtick from The Devil Wears Prada Stanley Tucci brightens the screen every time he shows up as the theater?s witty gay stage manager. But his genial contributions aren?t enough. Tucci is overrun by the machinery of synthetic spectacle operated with a newbie?s license by first-time feature writer-director Steven Antin. Must the show go on?

This is how Tess (Cher) the long-suffering owner of the nightclub at the center of Burlesque defends her new star Ali (Christina Aguilera) to the clubs jealous deposed marquee attraction Nikki (Kristen Bell). The same phrase could substitute as a marketing mission statement for Aguilera herself who throughout her decade-long adult career has deftly incorporated triumph-over-trauma into her brand. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Aguileras narrative presented to the world via lyrics music videos and interviews begins with an abusive father and single mother moves on to battles with depression and bad body image and has recently been updated to include now-mother Aguileras very public divorce. Through it all she seems to repeat a pattern Admit crippling vulnerability as in the hit ballad ""Beautiful"" and then boldly bitchily and nakedly (often almost literally) embrace the pain as in the single ""Fighter"" in which she thanks an unnamed tormentor because ""If it wasnt for all of your torture I wouldnt know how to be this way now and never back down.""Programmatic by design Burlesque flattens Aguileras inherent thorny appeal--the persona thats at once obnoxiously ""provocative"" and sympathetic--by laughably casting her as the 21st-century torch-signing equivalent of Ruby Keeler in a hodge-podge of Busby Berkeley plots with none of the Depression-era style or social critique. Aguileras innocent Ali is a small-town orphan who shows the audience her audacious singing talent over the opening credits and then Greyhounds it from her tiny Iowa hamlet to Hollywood. There she pounds the pavement looking for work and ends up at Burlesque where she instantly becomes entranced by the stage show highly gymnastic quasi-comic lip-synch routines set to standards performed by a cast of homogenous young things in sailor-motif underwear-as-outerwear. Ali might be impressed but business is hardly booming and its easy to see why Burlesque lacks both the reliable base appeal of a real strip club (while the costumes are skimpy they rarely come off) and with Tess the only member of the company who dares to sing live a personal touch. Ali (and the viewer) knows she can out-sing the recorded vocal tracks but she keeps her talent to herself while working her way up from waitress to dancer.Running an unconscionably extended 116 minutes Burlesque is nearly half over before Aguilera is allowed to be Christina Aguilera. When she finally shows Tess and crew what she can do--singing Etta Jamess ""Tough Lover"" without accompaniment--its the moment the movies been desperately waiting for. Time stops audiences both on- and off-screen simultaneously get tears in their eyes and shivers down their spines and gigantic boners and the films many flaws temporarily fall away.But only temporarily. Burlesque directed by Pussycat Dolls creator Steve Antin from a script credited to him and reportedly worked on by Diablo Cody and Susanna Grant is so hampered by its influences that it wastes its primary asset its superstar. Instead of leading with what Aguilera does best--belting vamping spotlight hogging--the movie shoehorns her into a rehashed backstage musical conceit Good girl is tempted by bad guy ultimately resists becomes a star finds love and saves the show. (The fact that naive Alis flirtation with the dark side is signified by her newfound proclivity for limited-edition stilettos and Herve Leger dresses is both hilarious and incisive.)Burlesque like Chicago before it offers dispiriting evidence that the Hollywood musical is stalled at weak imitation Bob Fosse. Cabaret is clearly Antins guiding reference with the similarities going way beyond the superficial (the hats the garters the chair dancing). Antin confines each musical number to the stage weaving in off-stage narrative--theres even a post-consummation love ballad illustrated with scenes from the bedroom a la Cabarets ""Maybe This Time."" What worked as a dialectical tactic in that film creating ironic tension between the worlds onstage and off- here feels like a tacit admission from Antin that he doesnt have enough faith in the audiences ability to watch an unbroken performance to read story and character development into the song and dance itself.To be fair its not like hes working with Kander and Ebb. Burlesques songs were written by a wide variety of producers and performers (Aguilera co-wrote just three) and not only is there no consistent creative throughline but they serve no storytelling function--in fact most songs were mixed like standard club tracks rendering specific lyrics incidental. The films catchiest tune is ""The Beautiful People"" bizarrely based on a Marilyn Manson sample. But Antin treats it like a throwaway using the song to back a scene that takes place outside of the club so even though Aguilera sings it Ali doesnt.Fred Astaire used to insist that his onscreen dances be shot wide and virtually uncut so that thered be no doubt the performers were doing it for real and not faking it for the camera. Antin takes the opposite approach fragmenting each number into quick glimpses of gestures so that we get no sense of how the dancers are moving through space. What you remember when its over is the impact of Aguileras voice but not what shes singing; montages of body parts but not the choreography; and Aguileras face music-video-trained to hold a close-up so emotionally exaggerated you might even call it a burlesque.1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Karina Longworth Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Howell Tearing a strip off Burlesque | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHowell Tearing a strip off BurlesqueBurlesque is laughable but not in the hah-hah sense. And it sure aint Showgirls.Christina Aguilera stars in Burlesque. (STEPHEN VAUGHAN / SCREEN GEMS)  Stanley Tucci and Cher star in Burlesque.  (STEPHEN VAUGHAN / SCREEN GEMS)  Christina Aguilera stars in Burlesque.  (STEPHEN VAUGHAN / SCREEN GEMS)  Stanley Tucci and Cher in a scene from Burlesque. (STEPHEN VAUGHAN / SCREEN GEMS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Nov. 23 2010Burlesque (out of 4)Starring Cher Christina Aguilera Stanley Tucci and Kristen Bell. Written and directed by Steven Antin. At major theatres. 119 minutes. PGSnobs cynics and hussies will try to tell you that Burlesque is a farrago of atrocious acting and worse singing.Point granted on the singing especially when Christina Aguilera is in full bovine belch as a frustrated Iowa farm girl who moves to Los Angeles to find her inner slut. One blast of her mighty pipes could stun an advancing bull moose at 50 paces.Article Continued BelowBut the knock against her acting is a damnable lie and the same goes for her co-star Cher likewise no stranger to social misconduct and moose-abusing vocals. Simple logic insists that superhuman thespian abilities were required to maintain a straight face when negotiating such farcical material.You try being Chers Tess co-owner of the titular Burlesque Lounge which promises ""the best view on the Sunset Strip"" then fails to deliver. Shes a fleshpot Norma Desmond -- and working on Sunset Boulevard -- who has to mouth howlers such as telling an aspiring butt wiggler that ""Maybe you could learn from my mistakes."" It helps that Chers face is now permanently immobile frozen in a rictus pose thats long past second thoughts about cosmetic surgery.And imagine Aguileras hard labour as the naive but nubile Ali Rose who must feign seriousness while telling everyone that her life ambition is to lacquer her face dress like a whore and sing PG-13 facsimiles of raunchy songs to drunks. Good thing Alis mom expired when she was 11; they dont approve of things like this down on the farm.Its all pretty laughable (and please note that Im kidding about the great acting) but it must be said that Burlesque is no Showgirls that hilarious attempt at multiplex-friendly porn that killed any chance of a rational adult film rating stateside.Burlesque writer/director Steven Antin may be one overpainted eyelash away from straight parody and his dialogue is certainly risible but not much of it is really funny in the hah-hah sense. Burlesque is not over the top enough to qualify it for the midnight movie hoot-fests that Showgirls enjoyed although you can certainly see the top from here. Its more corny than campy and more silly than sexy much mores the pity.No one could say that Aguilera doesnt give it her all though. This is her first real acting assignment and by God shes going to act.She shimmies and shakes that bod within every inch of its cantilevered curvature. When she belts out a dominatrix number she does so sans microphone defying the evil bee-yatchery perpetrated by perpetually drunk rival showgirl Nikki (Kristen Bell). Its like listening to a building demolition crew at work without hearing protection.No slouch herself in the over-emoting department when Cher sings the Diane Warren-penned power ballad ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"" it sounds like a threat. At least she seems to realize that shes acting in trash; sadly her role is rather compacted. What of men you ask? Not really wanted on the journey but its funny to see Stanley Tuccis gay dresser character seeming as if he was simply cut-and-pasted out of The Devil Wears Prada. You go girlStudly bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet) keeps the home fires burning very very slowly for Ali. Eric Dane gnaws foliage as a randy real estate developer. Peter Gallagher whines as Chers ex-hubby. Alan Cumming wishes so badly he could have been Joel Grey but hes barely in the film.Sex and nudity? Nothing more than youd see in a TV ad for the Bahamas unless the sight of someone consuming a banana onstage sounds arousing.The singing and dancing are better than in last years unfortunate Nine but thats not saying much. Youd expect Antin a videographer by past profession and current inclination to know a thing or two about movement.But it aint no Cabaret or even Chicago.Somewhere the ghost of Bob Fosse is smirking.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    23degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Burlesque lasts about 100 minutes. It doesnt feel a hair over 95. Its entertaining enough like watching a celebrity workout film with a plot. But never once is it believable. Really the movie should last 30 seconds. Christina Aguilera comes to Los Angeles from Iowa looking to perform and winds up in a female revue run by Cher. When her character Ali gets her big moment she belts out a number that almost makes Cher cry. Ali could have saved herself the trouble and sung in front of the power-lunchers at the Ivy and been turned instantly into Christina Aguilera.""Burlesque is the sort of movie that asks us to pretend that we dont know that this girl can sing. Or rather it asks us to wait for logical opportunity to stop pretending.How an instrument like hers has been lying undiscovered on a farm in Iowa for 20-odd years defies the laws of the entertainment. Aguilera doesnt have a set of pipes. She has a 4100-horsepower engine. When she sings in this movie the clubs audiences make the same face people did when Mark Wahlberg unzipped his pants in ""Boogie Nights.Alis big moment arrives when the revues resident shrew (Kristen Bell) tries to humiliate Ali by shutting off the music she and the other dancers have been using to lip sync in front of a packed house. The shrew thinks she has Ali right where she wants her. But Ali does a bit of pretending herself -- as if she doesnt know what to do -- then proceeds to knock everybodys socks off. The wait was worth it. But for her movie debut why stick Aguilera in a performance musical? We already know what that voice can do. Why not have her play Xtina a superhero who fights crime with her octave range? At least then she and Cher would be evenly matched.Aguilera has a natural screen presence more so than other singers -- Tim McGraw Jennifer Lopez Madonna -- whove devoted a lot of time to acting. But you watch Aguilera flit about in this nothing part and wonder if she really aches to impress you the way a Beyonce does. Beyonce isnt a natural actor. She is however an insatiable one. Aguilera conducts herself here like a woman who knows from where her next meal is coming (expensive record producers).And so alongside a star like Cher Aguilera no longer exists. As it turns out that face of Chers remains a peerless instrument. Its tight and shiny and angled (shes 64 now) but its not a mask. It belongs to a wise woman with a performers heavy soul. A movie called ""Burlesque is probably not the place to bare it. Still if you cut Cher shed bleed showbiz. Her opening minutes promise the world -- or least the world of cosmetics. She rises from piles of dancers like a lipstick. Then she turns into a den mother offering makeup advice and bantering with Stanley Tucci playing another legends quipping gay sidekick.She smashes a car window refuses to sell her club to the real-estate sleazebag (the sheet rocky Eric Dane) whos putting the moves on Ali and performs a song -- ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me -- alone on the stage. Is this really a song Cher needs to sing? Greta Garbo perhaps. Or a particularly cheeky Whac-a-Mole. But not a woman with this much Vegas under her belt. Are we to believe that even in this economy Cher -- or a woman Cher is playing -- would be running a club strapped for cash and that that place would be like the Pussy Cat Dolls doing a dinner-theater production of ""Cabaret?At some point you wonder whether Ali and her boss will share a song. They do not and my guess is we were spared. But that raises the question of why ""Burlesque exists at all. To unite two generations of gay men I suppose to remind fans of both women that they still have it to give the costume designer of Hollywood something splashy to do. Of course all the beads and feathers on display raise humanitarian concerns like how many Muppets were killed to make this movie?Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

If we dont know where we are there may be jokes but it is not truly comedy. Writer/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are not people with a lot of ideas. Their ""21 and Over"" was pretty much the same movie as their ""Hangover."" And the big innovation here is that this time its girls-gone-wild instead of boys. But it plays like it was inspired by a couple of womens magazine articles about the impossibility of ""having it all."" The movie says it comes down on the side of not judging other mothers those who seem to be losing it and those who seem to be holding it together. The message is that its good to forgive yourself for not being able to be perfect all the time. And its important to understand that loving your children means letting them learn to be responsible and not doing everything for them. But those good thoughts are undercut by the unexpectedly sour triumph of the main characters with antagonists who must be shown as spineless or pitiful. The reality of womens lives is a target-rich environment for comedy and the reality of mothers lives is especially so. But this script is so lazy that it does not meet the level of basic cable sitcoms for originality and wit. They have more in 22 minutes than ""Bad Moms"" does in 101. This is a movie that is supposed to be about female empowerment. There are two specific instances that involve women telling their cartoonishly awful husbands that they need to take more responsibility for their children and their households. And yet this is a movie that consistently shows the PTA as apparently entirely made up of women with the exception of one man who is shown at a PTA meeting specifically so he can be humiliated in public by his wife. Funny. amiright? And this is a school that apparently includes elementary middle and possibly high school students does not notice when a mother does a childs homework and has a pot-smoking principal who cant stand up to the President of the PTA. What? ""Hangover"" worked because most of the movie was about dealing with the horrible consequences of a major sort-of-accidental bender. ""Bad Moms"" tries to persuade us that a bender and attendant irresponsible behavior are signs of liberation. The bender is a mild one no tigers or tooth extractions. On the other hand the issue of money is raised but in the kind of fairy tale way that suggests no one connected with the movie has had to think about how to pay for groceries -- or damage inflicted on a grocery store -- in a very long time. Were supposed to believe them when they talk about how much they love their kids and would do anything for them but they dont really seem to enjoy or support them. And newsflash -- jokes about foreskins butt stuff and girl-on-girl kisses as a sign of rebellion and edginess are so 1998. The one-dimensional characters are as follows Mila Kunis plays Amy the exhausted mom of two who boots out her childish cheating husband. Shes had no sex in years. Kristen Bell is Kiki the exhausted mom of four whose husband treats her like Cinderella. They have sex once a week (""After ""Blue Bloods"") but he is not very uh excited or exciting. And Kathryn Hahn is Carla the happy unreliable slut who does not even know what a standardized test is much less whether her son has to take and pass them. She talks about sex all the time but does not seem to be having any either. Christina Applegate is Gwendolyn the Mean Girl (with henchmen played by Jada Pinkett-Smith and ""Bridesmaids"" co-writer Annie Mumolo (who should have done a major rewrite here). One thing Lucas and Moore get right is the combination of the humblebrag and the insult-wrapped in a compliment handed out by the ladies who run the school. Yes when they flutter their eyelashes and say ""I dont know how you do it"" to Amy she understands that they mean ""Youre doing it badly."" And there is a lot to be said about impossible standards and judgey people especially when it comes to parenting. But that requires actually saying something not just pointing it out. Amy blows her top decides not to try to be everything to everyone any more and then when Gwendolyn lashes back involving Amys daughter (in the Bizarro world of this movie the head of the PTA is in charge of everything in the school) Amy decides to run against her on a platform similar to but less authentic than that of Tammy in ""Election."" Even in a PTA election someone has to propose something more than ""lets do less and not judge each other."" All four women are brilliant actors and comedians and make as much of this material as they can but they all deserve much better. Jay Hernandez transcends the thankless role of the hot guy making him the only male in the film who is not completely infantilized. Someone needs to put him in a leading man role. And someone needs to start putting women in the leading role of writing and directing stories about women or at least men who can do better than this. NOTE The highlight of the movie is the series of conversations over the credits with the actresses and their real-life mothers filled with exactly the wit and heart missing from most of the film. Parents should know that this film is crude and explicit language throughout including very strong and crude language drinking drugs sexual references and explicit nudity and comic peril and violence. Family discussion Who is responsible for the standard the moms felt they had to live up to? How would this be different if it was about dads?

During the boring parts of this movie I played a game I made up that I called ""Same or Different."" For example in one of the earlier Bourne movies our hero the once-amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) grabbed a limited-use anonymous cell phone for a particularly clever maneuver. In this one he grabs a small tracking device handily left out in a bowl like peanuts at a bar for happy hour. Same or different? Different because the first one was plausible and this one was ridiculous. The earlier films had exceptionally well-staged fight scenes that felt like real people who get out of breath and hurt each other and jockey for advantage. In the first moments of this film in addition to completely unnecessary jumps between five different locations around the world for no purpose he knocks out an enormous professional fighter with one punch. Same or different? Same answer as above.  And if we distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys by how much collateral damage they inflict on the world -- how many innocent bystanders get killed the answer here is more same than different. There are franchise films made for fan service and then there are those that do not even service the fans are merely a cash grab and retroactively devalue the franchise. This is a movie that asks us to believe that the head of the CIA and a Mark Zuckerberg-young titan of the worlds coolest social media company a sort of cross between Google and Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat decide to have a conversation of the utmost secrecy in a posh Washington DC restaurant the kind where everyone eavesdrops on the big shots at the next table especially reporters politicians and Hill staffers. The first three Bourne films transcended the action/spy genre with a gritty almost intimate feel far from the glossiness of James Bond and with an expanding deepening storyline that as the then-LA Times critic Manohla Dargis said began with the existential in ""Identity"" (Who am I?) extended to the moral in ""Supremacy"" (What did I do?). With the third film the question of culpability extended to the larger ""I"" of the government Who are we and what have we done? We will put aside for the moment the non-Bourne ""Bourne"" which mistakenly went in the direction of a secret government program that was more ""Captain America"" than Bourne with a mysterious ability-enhancing drug that removed the somber reality that resonated with the era of waterboarding and Abu Ghraib. There is plenty to explore and attempt to expiate now and the movie tries to touch on contemporary issues explored in far more compelling -- and terrifying -- terms in documentaries like Alex Gibneys ""We Steal Secrets"" and ""Zero Days."" It just doesnt do anything interesting with them while it is piling improbable motivations and preposterous situations almost as high as the carnage and wrecked cars. Parents should know that this film has constant spy-related action-style peril and violence many characters injured and killed including many innocent bystanders themes of government corruption and some strong language. Family discussion Who should decide the balance between privacy and security and how much information about those decisions should be public? What real-life events inspired this story?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Burlesque is a terrible film that will delight nearly everyone who sees it whether theyre 12-year-old Christina Aguilera fans or bad-movie buffs angling for a guilty pleasure. Burlesque delivers exactly what it promises and then some Its a glittering neon valentine to divadom so exquisitely unapologetically gay that Alan Cummings homage to Joel Grey in Cabaret actually constitutes one of its butcher elements. The screenplay sometimes suggests an overachieving direct-to-DVD sequel to Showgirls so good in an egregiously awful fashion that someone decided to give it the A-list treatment and rope in big-name talent like Christina Aguilera--who finally has a Crossroads or Glitter to call her own--and Cher who here completes her evolution from camp diva to Academy Award-winning dramatic actress back into camp diva. Aguilera stars as a Small-Town Girl from Nowheresville Iowa who quits her thankless job as a waitress and heads to The Big City to Make It. Were in the land of archetypes here so each new character is a variation on one weve seen thousands of time before most particularly in Showgirls. In L.A. Aguilera scores a job as a waitress at a burlesque club run by saintly Cher and eventually makes her way onto the stage. There she becomes the clubs star attraction but will her rapid rise to glory be enough to keep the club from falling into the clutches of a wealthy playboy (Eric Dane) who just so happens to be wooing Aguilera? Will our plucky heroine ultimately choose Dane or Cam Gigandet an impossibly hunky bartender/aspiring songwriter with killer abs big dreams and a phantom actress girlfriend in New York who might just fall out of the picture whenever that proves narratively convenient? Steve Antins job as writer and director primarily involves keeping his divas happy. Late in the film Burlesque stops cold so Cher can deliver with only the faintest of pretenses her answer to Jennifer Hudsons big ""And I Am Telling You Im Not Going"" number from Dreamgirls. Why? Because Cher hasnt had a huge dramatic moment for about 20 minutes and Burlesque is committed to doling out an endless series of hysterically over-the-top climaxes borrowed from other show-biz melodramas. Burlesque is the kind of instant camp classic that audiences enjoy shouting along with countless times a la Rocky Horror Picture Show or The Room.  But the film hews so lovingly to genre conventions that anyone with even a passing familiarity of its cliches will be able to shout every line along with the actors the first time around.

More about Burlesque >> Oh yes you will my tippling kitten in the black lace catsuit. Oh yes you will. Those mutant lungs belong to Ali (Christina Aguilera) an improbably wholesome tease from Iowa who works that corn-tassel hair and those brass pipes in ways that get her promoted from chorus line to headliner. Burlesque is a preposterous and intermittently entertaining lesson in how to make a movie musical with a little brains and a lot of talent. While the obvious antecedents of Steve Antins film are 42nd Street Flashdance and Showgirls - backstage musicals in which performance is a means of self-actualization - the theme is Ali in Wonderland. When the Iowa waitress takes the Greyhound to L.A. she falls down a Hollywood rabbit hole that takes her to a nightclub like that in Bob Fosses 1935 Berlin in Cabaret. The geography of this joint? South of Gypsy Rose Lees G-string and north of Bettie Pages garters. The club conveniently called Burlesque is a smoke-filled circus ringmastered by Tess (Cher) that waxworks Cleopatra with the tequila-cured voice. Onstage women resembling drag queens dance provocatively while lip-synching to ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend."" Offstage fairy godfather Sean (Stanley Tucci) the wisecracking costumer dispenses arch witticisms. Ali may not know much but she knows she wants this. Indifferent Tess the mother that Ali never had tells the upstart ""You gotta make me believe that you belong up there"" And when Nikki unplugs the sound system while Ali is lip-synching the Iowa gal belts out a rafter-raising song that earns her top-billing. She sells tickets but not enough to keep Eric Dane a real estate developer waiting for Burlesques mortgage to default from hoping for foreclosure. So much for the plot a floss-thin line on which to hang razzle-dazzle production numbers many performed on a stage seemingly four times the size of the club itself. From the looks of it more thought went into Michael Kaplans inventive costumes - confections of strategically placed sequins and pearl festoons - than the script. Dancewise the numbers are more rap-video flygirl than properly burlesque although Aguilera does perform a suggestive homage to Sally Rands fan dance. Bojan Bazellis choreography is seductive and witty. But the editing of the dance sequences is so choppy that everything looks diced and reassembled the sign of a director who didnt photograph the sequences for cinematic effect. Songwise Cher and Aguilera each have a couple of memorable numbers - though not a duet which would have better meshed their two story lines and been nice in a passing-the-torch kind of way. Early in the film Aguilera belts ""Somethings Got a Hold on Me"" commanding the screen and setting the tone for the movie. Amazing voice. But either her acting chops are limited or Antins screenplay gives her only two moods Flirty and petulant. She has fun with ""But I Am a Good Girl"" as the pampered gal wearing a string of pearls and a smile. Cher sings the films suggestive title song ""Welcome to Burlesque"" and also a Diane Warren number ""Far From Over"" a you-havent-seen-the-last-of-me ballad which will do for her what ""My Way"" did for Sinatra. Cher is a damn good actress (see Silkwood Moonstruck Mask). Too bad Antins script gives her few opportunities to show it. Burlesque is a movie with a definite audience. Namely anyone who appreciates Cher Christina the ""Wagon Wheel Watusi"" and knows that the art director set the Burlesque Lounge next to the fire escape where Richard Gere proposed to Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.

"Sometimes camp is not enough - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Sometimes camp is not enoughBurlesque a 1 1/2 starsNovember 23 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe choicest dialogue in ""Burlesque"" provokes the sort of laughter that other intentionally funny films only dream of generating. Gather round for some free samples In the opening seconds a country singer on the helpful soundtrack sings ""If ah ever left this town..."" Not one minute later the plucky Iowa waitress played by Christina Aguilera announces to her co-worker ""Ahm leavin."" After a few bars of 80s synthesizer and a travel montage young Ali gets off the bus to L.A. and stumbles head first into a swanky neo-burlesque joint on Sunset Boulevard run by someone named Tess played by something called Cher. Ali worms her way in as a cocktail waitress but she dreams bigger She yearns to bump and grind and cleavage like the other performers while still staying this side of an R rating. ""Ive just never seen anything like this before"" she says. Auditioning for Tess Ali slays her with a number called ""Wagon Wheel Watusi"" and a star is born. Then when Tess hears her sing (much to the jealous disdain of Alis alcoholic rival played by Kristen Bell) its like God Herself was this kids agent. ""I will not be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs"" Bell protests. Later Cher zings a weaker specimen by pointing out ""Youre throwing up everything but your memories"" Most backstage musicals are ridiculous but this is ridiculous. Is there a love interest? Shyeah Alis roommate the metrosexual club bartender played by an overmatched blank named Cam Gigandet of ""The O.C."" gets huffy when Ali stays out late with the zillionaire developer (Eric Dane) intent on buying the club for his own nefarious purposes. Which way will Alis heart take her? Writer-director Steven Antin may have a heart as big as Iowa and California put together but hes not much of a filmmaker. The perpetually unsteady camerawork (a choice but a bad one) the suffocating claustrophobia induced by the preponderance of ""Chicago""-inspired club interiors the high-fructose corn syrup disguised as dialogue Its a lot to overcome which is where a movie musicals musical numbers usually come in. The Rob Marshall ""Chicago"" and ""Nine"" aesthetic rules the roost here. This means the theatrical scenic design the bowler hats the Weimar-era vibe the finger-snaps and pelvic rotations all recall recycle and ultimately reduce the memory of Bob Fosse while the direction and editing hatchet the dance rhythms into teeny little bits of disconnected posing. The choreography itself is better Co-choreographer Denise Faye has done wonderful work on various Broadway stages as a performer in Fosse shows and others. As for the actual stars Aguilera sings her lungs out but the songs are pretty awful. Cher sings her lungs out too in her imperious frozen-upper-lip style though not as often as Aguilera. The whole movie amounts to an I-will-survive anthem. Antins sister founded the real-life neo-burlesque L.A. troupe known as the Pussycat Dolls. Will sanitized burlesque sell on screen? Will interest in the acting chops (so-so) of Aguilera and the cosmetic rehab wonder that is Cher stoke the box office? Some questions are too vast to consider without benefit of opening-weekend grosses. The films inadvertent laughs start petering out around the two-thirds point which is sad. But at its worst/best ""Burlesque"" is a camp hoot the likes of which we havent seen in a long time. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content including several suggestive dance routines partial nudity language and some thematic material) Cast Cher (Tess); Christina Aguilera (Ali); Eric Dane (Marcus); Cam Gigandet (Jack); Julianne Hough ( Georgia); Peter Gallagher (Vince); Alan Cumming (Alexis); Kristen Bell (Nikki); Stanley Tucci (Sean) Credits Written and directed by Steven Antin; produced by Donald De Line.

Daily Edition Login to download Burlesque -- Film Review 857 PM PST 11/18/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Sony Pictures A refreshing throwback to movie musicals that celebrates its stars while indulging in sexy fun. TWITTER It has to be one of the oldest stories in the Hollywood playbook Ingenue comes to Tinseltown and becomes an overnight sensation which inspires romance conflicts and animosities. But this tale gets a vibrant makeover in writer-director Steve Antins toe-tapping flamboyantly skin-deep musical Burlesque. Yes its only skin-deep and so what? Perhaps because theyre so rarely attempted these days recent musicals have felt a self-conscious need to dig for significance whether it be artistic malaise (Nine) racial inequality (Dreamgirls) or media manipulation (Chicago). Burlesque stays aggressively on the surface reveling in its artificiality. It was a risky bet by this first-time feature director to cast songstress Christina Aguilera a singer who had never acted in a film. The stroke of genius here is to pair her with pop-music icon Cher. Although Aguilera is in nearly every scene and Cher appears irregularly they nicely balance each other as they play single-minded characters passionate about their work as cabaret performers. One is at wits end about a possibly dying art and the other too fresh and enthused to notice. One singer-actress is an old pro and the other a superb entertainer exploring a new avenue for her talent. (Note to Cher In this instance ""old"" is a good thing and a compliment. You still look fabulous.) Another successful gamble was to make a musical traditionally a mating ritual into a female-centric extravaganza. The movie backgrounds its male characters as best it can -- Love Interest Best (Gay) Friend Frantic Ex-Husband Ravenous Real Estate Developer -- so the beautiful fabulous women are front and center. Women will love this and men wont mind the eye candy either so it looks like this Screen Gems release cant help becoming a hit. News stories about conflicts on the set and reshoots will only fuel the curiosity factor. Besides burlesque itself -- a stage-show tradition dating to late-19th century British music halls -- with its risque humor and ample flesh (without full exposure) is making a comeback. Burlesque should seal the deal. The movie takes place in a Sunset Boulevard theater called the Burlesque Lounge thats on its last legs no matter how curvy and luscious those legs may be. In walks the naive heroine from Iowa Aguileras Ali Rose. Shes hooked the minute she sees Chers Tess the clubs co-owner and resident diva belt out ""Welcome to Burlesque"" backed by a chorus line in fishnet stockings and eye-popping bustiers. No one will give her a job so with the help of a handsome bartender (Cam Gigandet) -- Love Interest -- she creates one out of thin air. She grabs a tray and is now a cocktail waitress only one urgent plea/conniving manipulation/sensational audition away from that glorious stage. She gets that shot of course and later gets to display that big Aguilera voice which rocks the theater. A star may be born but ""nothings what it seems"" -- one of the many cliche lines that Antins screenplay indulges in with glee. The Burlesque Lounge teeters on bankruptcy. Tess Frantic Ex-Husband (Peter Gallagher) pleads her to sell to the Real Estate Developer (Eric Dane) while her Best (Gay) Friend (Stanley Tucci) assures her that things somehow will work out. The films romantic melodrama centers on Alis tentative flirtation with the bartender. They end up circumstantial roommates in his Hollywood apartment but he has a ""fiancee"" back in New York a nightly long-distance phone call that does nothing to warm his bed. Back at the theater a good girl (Julianne Hough) is pregnant and a bad girl (Kristen Bell) insanely jealous of Alis popularity. And so the various plot lines go serving mostly to inspire song-and-dance numbers from the female performers. Occasionally a number takes place in the mind of its heroine. Perhaps the entire movie actually takes place there. The songs tip their hats to various showbiz traditions. ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" is a nod to 50s showstoppers ""Wagon Wheel Watusi"" leans toward 60s pop and ""Somethings Got a Hold on Me"" and blues pieces add a touch of soul. Dances choreographed by Denise Faye and Joey Pizzi arent conventional displays of happy feet and athletic agility. Instead numbers are a series of poses built around a prop like a chair. Hair flies this way buttocks thrust that way and arms strike out at abrupt angles. Virginia Katzs editing is swift as Bojan Bazellis camera moves fluidly in front of the stage. Antin is in his element here. His sister Robin founded mischievous burlesque troupe the Pussycat Dolls and he has directed a couple of their videos. He clearly loves this world. The numbers would make Ziegfeld proud; they glorify the American girl with only a little PG-13 naughtiness. Antin knows what you came to see and he delivers. So does Aguilera. Her role is kept deliberately nondescript so she can fill it with her own personality and big voice. She does bring beguiling innocence to the part along with a single-minded determination and a hellacious amount of performing talent. Cher gets only one other number ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"" which might become her anthem just as ""My Way"" belonged to Sinatra. Tucci has his moments as the stage manager and Tess right-hand man to lighten the melodrama but the other roles tend toward blandness. The worst served is Alan Cumming. If ever a performer should have been at home in this milieu its Cumming -- who after all has done Cabaret onstage. Did his role wind up on the cutting-room floor? Nonetheless credit Antin with pulling the film musical back to its roots. With Moulin Rouge and Chicago the musical was beginning to look like long-playing videos. Burlesque is a smart and sassy expedition back to MGM musicals under Arthur Freed by way of Bob Fosses jazz-style song-and-dance movies. Indeed the film musical it most closely resembles is Fosses Sweet Charity. So Burlesque celebrates its talented stars and the renaissance of burlesques cheeky fun. The only disappointment is that no Burlesque Lounge actually exists on Sunset Boulevard. On film its such a rockin joint.

A certain garishness goes with the territory but the rest is all writer-director Steven Antins doing in ""Burlesque"" an overwrought underwritten hootchy-kootchy tuner that desperately wants to be ""Cabaret"" but lacks the edge and historical context to pull it off. Unfolding with the wide-eyed innocence of a classic MGM musical in which an orphaned country girl -- played by vocally endowed acting-challenged pop star Christina Aguilera -- finds her place within the dysfunctional family of a racy Sunset Strip nightclub ""Burlesque"" partially redeems its clumsy drama through infectious song and dance enough to win over a midsize teen (and gay) following. Aguilera plays Ali an Iowa waitress of indeterminate age who cant stand one more minute in her dusty small town quits her job and then sticks around to sing an opening number (an Etta James cover) before catching the bus to Los Angeles. Her dreams arent big -- just something better than she left behind -- and she realizes them in the Burlesque Lounge a retro-styled joint where scantily clad stunningly beautiful showgirls outnumber the customers performing a mix of old and new songs. ""Burlesque"" is to its namesake what gentlemens clubs are to genuine gentlemen -- a stripped-down tarted-up lingerie show divorced from the stage traditions satirical heritage which makes for sexy flash-of-skin dance numbers (ably edited by ""Dreamgirls"" cutter Virginia Katz) in lieu of wit or parody. The thin drama stumbles until Ali reaches the club -- energized by Chers ""Welcome to Burlesque"" -- a song that simultaneously introduces all the key characters and sells the nightclubs appeal (the only example of expositional multitasking to be found on the soundtrack). Clearly the Burlesque Lounge is where Ali belongs but it delivers virtually nothing in the way of conflict The only obstacle is for Ali to win over tough-love Tess the motherly co-owner of the club who looks more like a Cher impersonator than the real Cher during her entrance -- but soon reminds us of her gifts as both siren and star socking over the movies lone ballad the Diane Warren-written ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"" in what could have been a throwaway scene. The dancers are more or less interchangeable with the exception of resident diva Nikki (Kristen Bell) and Georgia (""Dancing With the Stars"" winner Julianne Hough) whose conveniently timed pregnancy provides an opening for Ali. Meanwhile Antin deliberately blurs the sexuality of the male characters including androgynous emcee Alexis (Alan Cumming in ""Cabaret"" mode) gay stage manager Sean (Stanley Tucci who survives unscathed) and eyeliner-wearing bartender Jack (""Twilights"" Cam Gigandet). ""Burlesque"" may be trading in archetypes but thats no excuse for the fact Ali is the least developed of these characters. Is she 20 or 30? A virgin or a skank? Antin gives us nothing to go on apart from a detail about Alis mom dying shortly after the girls seventh birthday and Aguilera while undeniably entertaining when her character is onstage cannot spin the slight backstory into anything resembling a full-blooded person. Its a shortcoming considering how much Tucci and Cher are able to do with their relatively minor roles. As long as theres music playing and girls sashaying the movie delivers. But the instant it returns to earth the seams start to show. What ""Burlesque"" needs is texture -- not the red-velvet-and-rhinestones look that dominates the production design but any sense that these are real people with real dreams facing real obstacles rather than the overdue mortgage and moneybags investor (Eric Dane) Antin conjures up. Antin who has been prominently billed on posters and bus sides is a former actor who made his screenwriting debut with 1992s indie satire ""Inside Monkey Zetterland."" While that movie aired the self-absorbed frustrations of those who drift into Los Angeles in search of stardom only to find rejection ""Burlesque"" paints a rosier picture of showbiz where talented hard workers eventually get their shot -- none of the chewed-up and spat-out ""Showgirls""-style vitriol here. Script shortcomings aside Antin still manages to marshal an impressive production and below-the-line contributions are consistently pro except for greenscreen effects that look less convincing than Aguileras eyelashes. The film economically divides its time between the Burlesque Lounge and Jacks apartment cutting to the clubs neon marquee so often between scenes that a drinking game seems in order. The lounge itself looks great a model that could easily translate to a themed restaurant or Broadway show if the need should ever arise.
