Aaron Eckhart and Ben Kingsley star in what is supposed to be an edgy psychological thriller about an FBI agent (Eckhart) and a mysterious stranger who seems to have the inside track on a series of unsolved serial murders. The formula is familiar Eckharts character Thomas Mackelway has just arrived at the bureaus Albuquerque office having been demoted from Dallas; hes plagued with headaches and compulsively pops aspirin with giant cups of coffee; his past catches up with him when his former partner and love interest played by Carrie-Anne Moss shows up to help with his current case. And Mackelways nemesis played by Kingsley takes such pains to prove his diabolical brilliance that he might as well be waving pictures of Hannibal Lecter and ""Sevens"" John Doe in front of Mackelway saying ""See? Like these guys"" Aaron Eckhart left and Ben Kingsley star in yet another pale imitation of 1995s ""Seven."" (Melissa Moseley -- Paramount Pictures Via Reuters) _____More in Movies_____  Suspect Zero Details  Watch the Trailer  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert Well sort of. Kingsley who cut such an unforgettable figure of restrained rage last year in ""The House of Sand and Fog"" isnt given much of a chance to do his thing until the final 20 minutes of ""Suspect Zero."" By that time filmgoers will be forgiven for getting up leaving the theater picking up the dry cleaning getting a few things at the supermarket going home weeding the garden and giving the dog a bath -- at least in their own minds. His character has an admittedly arresting story one rooted in some of the American intelligence communitys more fascinating arcana but its buried under so many heavy layers of slack storytelling and visual self-consciousness that Kingsley never has a chance to really run with it. Working from a script by Zak Penn and Billy Ray director E. Elias Merhige -- whose most recent film was ""The Shadow of the Vampire"" -- makes the common error of mistaking upside-down camera angles grainy film stock and periodic shifts in color for style. Whats more he trots out some unforgivably hoary cliches such as the scene of Mackelway muttering to himself in front of a bulletin board cluttered with newspaper clippings and gruesome crime scene photos. And be assured those images -- mostly of brutalized women and children -- are ghastly making ""Suspect Zero"" the kind of movie that traffics in gratuitous images of torture and gore while pretending to be appalled by them. Such hypocrisy is by now so commonplace in Hollywood that it seems pointless to notice let alone register a complaint. Still it makes you long to take in a true classic of cinema suspense -- a picture like say ""Chinatown."" As it happens that films screenwriter Robert Towne makes an uncredited cameo appearance in ""Suspect Zero"" as a professor who explains the films title -- a reference to a serial killer who leaves no telltale pattern of clues. Instead of using Towne to make strained comparisons between murderers and black holes the filmmakers might have been better advised to simply ask him for a tutorial in crafting a tricky absorbing and authentically stylish thriller. Suspect Zero (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violent content profanity and some nudity.

Starring Aaron Eckhart Ben Kingsley Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by E. Elias Merhige. Written by Zak Penn and Billy Ray. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). A serial-killer thriller faces a tough task these days. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" perfected the form several years ago and in the time since a constant loop of grisly real-life tales on cable television has inured viewers to fictional renderings. ""Suspect Zero"" needed to be exceptional and it isnt. Its merely adequate with one riveting element but limited chills. It doesnt help that the movie invites comparisons to ""Silence"" by featuring a knighted British actor (Sir Ben Kingsley) as a madman fascinated by an FBI agent (Aaron Eckhart) and willing to provide clues to crimes. But only one side of the relationship in ""Suspect Zero"" holds interest and its not the side of law and order. Kingsley plays Benjamin ORyan an unhinged transient either taunting or trying to assist Eckharts Agent Thomas Mackelway who has been shipped to the boonies of New Mexico from Dallas after going off on a suspect. The first scene reveals that ORyan is a killer sucking much of the mystery from the rest of the film. But he might be a relatively small fish as suggested in the faxes he sends to Mackelway. (Watching the aforementioned cable shows has taught me that people who send faxes to the FBI want to get caught -- thank you Aamp;E). ORyan insists that he is leading the way to a more heinous serial killer who has gone undetected on a long-term national tour. The question of who is a bigger serial killer like the question of who has a bigger boat is of interest mainly to the participants. Its a weird premise to hang a movie on. Do we root for the guy who has killed 10 people as opposed to the guy who killed 100? But ORyans way of ""seeing"" crimes is fascinating. He summons details through ""remote viewing"" which goes beyond profiling. Scenes of this process are expertly rendered offering the pictures only moments of true creepiness. Kingsley stiffens his already coiled body as ORyan furiously scribbles patterns and numbers evoking fragmented sepia-toned visions of faces and locations. A lesser actor might have gone over the top with this role but Kingsley is contained. He never gives anything away tempering the characters menace with signs of vulnerability. Eckhart is also unreadable but in a less intriguing way. His measured performance makes it difficult to get a bead on Mackelway. Then again its hard to play a man whose most distinctive trait is a tendency toward migraine headaches. Its hard to play a headache -- a constant grimace would be too broad. Eckhart occasionally looks irritated but never tortured as his character is supposed to be. Carrie-Anne Moss possessed of a haunted elegance even in her happier moments could have played tortured but she is relegated to the Scully role of the FBI mans fellow agent former lover and chief skeptic. More background on Eckharts character might have helped the actors cause but the screenplay by Zak Penn and Billy Ray offers scant insight into what made him a loose cannon. Ray writer and director of ""Shattered Glass"" is part of a filmmaking team with stellar credentials including ""Shadow of the Vampire"" director E. Elias Merhige and cinematographer Michael Chapman. Perhaps great talent cant multiply only divide. Many scenes without Kingsley are stilted especially those set in the New Mexico FBI office. Mackelways assertions are met with doubt at every turn in the manner of a bad TV cop show. Hes told to stop dawdling and follow procedure even though hes ostensibly the star of this outpost. ""Suspect Zero"" goes light on gore which usually is a good thing. But a cheap jolt or two might have helped given the films absence of mystery. The subtle composed shots preferred by director Merhige and cinematographer Chapman work only about half the time. A slow pan over a fresh backyard burial ground is unsettling but an image of a creaking swing isolated before a desert landscape and missing the child who was just in it is less eerie than an arty abstraction. Worse yet its an arty abstraction weve seen before. -- Advisory This film contains violence and unsettling images.

For starters the director is E. Elias Merhige whose way-underground 1991 debut feature Begotten counted both Susan Sontag and Marilyn Manson (whose 1996 music video Anti-Christ Superstar Merhige went on to direct) among its admirers and who in 2000 released the fiendishly clever Shadow of the Vampire a fictional account of the making of F.W. Murnaus Nosferatu. The screenwriters are Billy Ray who wrote and directed last falls superb Shattered Glass and Zak Penn a veteran Hollywood scribe (Last Action Hero X-Men 2) whose own enterprising directorial debut Incident at Loch Ness opens next month. Then there is the fact that Suspect Zero is ""A C/W Production"" the ""C"" standing for Cruise as in Tom. Yet it was filmed more than two years ago and is only now opening cast off amid those late-summer doldrums that regularly carry unloved big-studio movies to their final resting places. I would like nothing more than to report that Suspect Zero counters conventional wisdom and is in fact a hitherto undiscovered gem. No such luck. Despite the impressive credentials it is one of those agonizingly routine police procedurals in which a cop whos fallen from favor finds himself taunted by a much smarter serial killer and following a trail of clues that inevitably lead to a grimy apartment wherein one needs a flashlight in order to see past ones nose. (What beef do serial killers have with the electric company anyway?) The kink this time around lest we suspect weve accidentally stumbled into an encore screening of Taking Lives is that the cop is an FBI agent (Aaron Eckhart) relocated from Dallas to Albuquerque and the killer is no ordinary psycho but one who targets other serial killers as his prey. Furthermore this bloodlusty Avenging Angel played by Ben Kingsley with a physical rigidity that suggests hinged steel rods in place of bone and sinew may himself be a former FBI agent trained by the bureau in the psychic art of ""remote viewing."" Conspiracy-minded readers will remember that ""remote viewing"" refers to a long-rumored government intelligence program in which ""viewers"" in one location envision events supposedly happening at some other location. As was finally revealed in the mid-90s the CIA actually did spend upward of 20 million over a period of two decades on the development of such a program (known as Project Stargate) only to conclude that the funds might just as well have been spent on Ouija boards and tarot cards. As a movie subject remote viewing feels similarly trite. After all there have already been Manhunter and Seven to show us without resorting to paranormal hooey how the minds of criminal and pursuer may grow to resemble each other. And there has been Charlie Kaufman to take us on cranial roller-coaster rides endlessly more twisty and terrifying than those experienced by Kingsleys Benjamin ORyan. So whats the point? When ORyan searching for his next victim goes into his remote-viewing trance the images he sees -- sometimes appearing in blotchy infrared other times in grainy black-and-white -- are supposed to be slowly driving him mad. For the most part theyre no more disconcerting than the helmet-cam shots on display during the average NFL Sunday. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm What is disconcerting is that while Suspect Zero offers occasional reminders of Merhiges instinctive knack for moving pictures -- near the end theres an arrestingly creepy depiction of a childs disappearance among billowing laundry -- and a few other fleeting pleasures such as Robert Townes amusing cameo as ORyans former criminology professor there are more frequent reminders of the dispiriting lengths to which a talented director must sometimes go in order to continue working. (In its way Suspect Zero is more depressing than the ordinary bad movie because you can actually sense Merhiges own distress with the lifeless material and his frustration at trying to make something worthwhile out of it.) If one is to take his first two features as any indication Merhiges temperament -- that of a restless artist -- will only occasionally find a fit among the projects Hollywood has to offer. Yet two features per decade is no way to keep a career going and so sometimes one must compromise by agreeing to make a film that is as null and void as its title suggests.

One things for certain If youre going to sit through yet another iteration of the cop-vs.-serial-killer-who-leaves-taunting-calling-cards genre -- and with ""Suspect Zero"" lets face it you are -- the last thing you want is to think too much or to look at your watch or to be able to detach yourself from the proceedings and step outside them ever. Watching ""Suspect Zero"" makes all of those things very very hard to do and I have a blank notebook page to prove it. Ben Kingsley as Benjamin ORyan ramps up the fear factor in the conventional yet shiver-inducing ""Suspect Zero."" (Melissa Moseley -- Paramount Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Suspect Zero Details  Watch the Trailer  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert Other than the films title and some scribbled notations indicating that the films first few minutes included some naughty words I took virtually no notes. I couldnt. I was too wrapped up in it too swamped by its fevered shivery mood to stop and deconstruct it. Part of the reason certainly is the cast including Aaron Eckhart and Carrie-Anne Moss but led in its assault by a finely unhinged Ben Kingsley as Benjamin ORyan the former-FBI-agent-turned-homicidal-maniac who lends the film its title (or does he?). As a man who gets to play both the mouse and the cat in this familiar game of cat and mouse hes great and his fierce on-screen performance (some of which consists of nothing but close-ups of his eye) is largely responsible for the intense gravitational pull the film exerts on our own eyeballs. Another reason is filmmaker E. Elias Merhige who in his making-of-""Nosferatu"" drama ""Shadow of the Vampire"" (the directors first foray into mainstream moviemaking) proved he knew his way around the dark corners of boogeyman-haunted nightmares. Tom Mackelway (Eckhart) is a disgraced FBI agent (yes I know thats another cliche but Merhige doesnt allow you to dwell on it too much). Sent in punishment from Dallas to the Bureaus Albuquerque field office -- an outpost so bush league there isnt even a Starbucks nearby -- Mackelway is soon knee-deep in the kind of bizarre case you occasionally read about in the papers but you mostly only see in the movies An eyelid-less corpse has turned up in a car parked precisely on the state line. At this point Mackelways clueless. Well not literally since the crime scene is scattered with drawings scraps of paper and bloody markings on the corpse bearing the killers signature a circle with a slash through it (zero get it?). We on the other hand pretty much already know who done it because it gets done in the chilling opening scene in which Kingsley firmly establishes his hold on us. Joined by Fran Kulok (Moss) a Dallas FBI agent with whom Mackelway used to apparently have a ""thing"" (I know I know weve seen this before too) Mackelway is quickly swept up in the pursuit of ORyan dubbed Suspect Zero. Slowly as the two draw closer and as the bodies pile up (along with missing-person faxes on Mackelways office floor) it becomes less clear who is the hunter and who is the hunted. Is ORyan -- a gifted (or cursed) psychic once trained as a ""remote viewing"" crime solver in a top-secret FBI program -- really Suspect Zero the mother of all serial killers and one who cant be profiled? Or is he like Mackelway merely looking for that guy too? The truth is that were the real prey and that Merhige working from a script by Zak Penn and Billy Ray is the one whos reeling us in with a devilishly alluring Kingsley as the bait. Is the script conventional? Sure. Have we seen some of these characters and setups a hundred times before? Dont I know it. Still with its spooky atmosphere to spare and a riveting central performance by Kingsley an actor who manages to elicit both terror and sympathy I was able to forget all those things basking in the pleasure of my own goose bumps. So for an hour and a half will you. SUSPECT ZERO (R 100 minutes) -- Contains violence gore obscenity rape and brief nudity. Area theaters.

Suspect Zero Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/suspect-zero-2004,200,suspectzero10,suspectzero,rogerebert
"Cast plot dont add any thrills to `Suspect - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Cast plot dont add any thrills to `Suspect By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 27 2004 The editor of the serial killer thriller ""Suspect Zero"" has a tendency to cut away in the middle of a scene to things that have no direct bearing on what wed just been watching. Some of these cuts suggest both infrared surveillance and a dada filmmaking workshop. Others are random visits with Ben Kingsley who appears to be an obsessive-compulsive and our resident nut. We see him seated at a desk playing word games and scribbling portentous images while a voice on a tape recorder soothingly commands him to ""draw the environment draw the environment now.""There may be wackos on the loose but whatevers happening in the cutting room of this movie seems just as crazy. ""Suspect Zero"" has a jittery unstable personality that prevents it from focusing on the tasks at hand like catching serial killers before they strike again. Director E. Elias Merhige whose last film was ""Shadow of the Vampire"" is clearly aiming for apocalypse -- you could start an elementary school with the number of missing children in the film -- but theres zilch in the thrill department.In the foreground of all this is Aaron Eckhart as FBI agent Tom Mackelway. The mutilated bodies hes finding come with clues some of which are taunts aimed at him. ""Suspect Zero"" is set in the sort of universe where madmen like Kingsley still have time to send hundreds of faxes. Kingsleys hammy impeccably dressed loon might be a Godsend in cracking the case; he might be the devil. Or maybe he thinks hes in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" The movie just confuses and annoys you into not caring.Carrie-Anne Moss playing Fran Kulok another agent and -- of course -- Mackelways ex is brought in to help straighten out this mess. Her assistance amounts to wearing pantsuits that make Eckharts stained shirts and wrinkled slacks seem feminine. When Mackelway starts going sleepless and teary with certainty that this killer is after him he turns to Kulok who just stands there and watches him break down the way Gillian Anderson used to do to David Duchovny.And just like on ""The X-Files"" Mackelway is on to something and predictably enough nobody believes him. Once he figures this out his boss (Harry Lennix pinched and nasal) gives him the day off. Which as it turns out is exactly what he needs to get his man. Had ""Suspect Zero"" not been rendered as a grisly abstraction it could have been fun. Eckhart who gets more rugged by the picture certainly works hard to bring the audience along. But hes a nervous wreck for nothing. This movie isnt talking to us its talking to other serial killer movies. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Title of Suspect Zero just about sums it upBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY The insipid thriller Suspect Zero could inspire a new wave of self-help literature The Murder-Driven Life When Bad Things Happen to Worse People or Chicken Soup for the Serial Killers Soul. (Related item Watch the trailer) Carrie-Anne Moss stars in Suspect Zero. The movies premise is as dopey as they come A serial killer with a conscience is killing other serial killers. Well theres a bit more to it most of it laughable a top-secret government program telepathy clairvoyance and some baiting by the way-smarter killer (Ben Kingsley) of his pursuer a tortured FBI agent (Aaron Eckhart). Any sense of dread or drama in the story is dissipated by disjointed editing overused stop-frame visuals bleached of color comically familiar eerie music and numerous shots of cockeyed handwriting (a la Seven which did it in an original way). Suspect Zero  and 1/2 stars out of four Stars Ben Kingsley Aaron Eckhart Carrie-Anne Moss Harry Lennix Director E. Elias Merhige Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating R for violent content language and some nudity And then there are the characters. Eckhart plays the independent-minded but obsessively dedicated FBI agent who has been demoted from the big city to a town in the middle of nowhere for not following orders. His new by-the-book supervisor (Harry Lennix) fills an equally recognizable role tough boss continually locking horns with his new underling. In his despair Mr. Independent Agent turns to his career-obsessed former girlfriend (Carrie-Anne Moss) but she has her own doubts about his professionalism and sanity. One wonders how an actor of Kingsleys caliber was persuaded to take the role of the psychic obsessive-compulsive yet soft-hearted killing machine. (He gets all misty-eyed listening to a gospel choir but he murders the most heinous killers in his own brutal ways.) Kingsley however at times does manage to slip from stereotypical to sinister. Whenever he commits one of his vigilante murders he leaves a zero with a diagonal slash through it. In math this symbol signifies an empty set. And that certainly describes Suspect Zeros screenplay. Perhaps a better title for this mess would have been Avenging Angels in America or better yet The Silence of the Logic.

Elias Merhige stumbles in his transition to a more traditional thriller -- delivering a plodding and familiar ""cop sees what the killer sees"" riff. ""Suspect Zero"" appears destined for a brief theatrical life with better prospects of tracking down business in ancillary venues. After a promising debut with ""Shadow of the Vampire"" director E. Elias Merhige stumbles in his transition to a more traditional thriller -- delivering a plodding and familiar ""cop sees what the killer sees"" riff that plays like a poorly inflated ""The X-Files"" episode. With minimal star power and a somewhat convoluted premise ""Suspect Zero"" registers closer to its titular digit than Bo Derek territory on a 1-to-10 scale and appears destined for a brief theatrical life with better prospects of tracking down business in ancillary venues. Starting with the ""Blair Witch""-y appearance of its signature image -- a zero with a nil slash through it -- theres little that feels fresh about this project which begins earnestly enough but exhausts too much time building toward a ""reveal"" thats actually in its trailer. In a straight leading man turn unlike his shadier roles in the company of Neil LaBute Aaron Eckhart plays discredited FBI agent Thomas Mackelway. Booted from Dallas down to the backwater of New Mexico hes almost instantly confronted with a baffling homicide and reunited with his former partner and lover (Carrie-Anne Moss). Fairly quickly Mackelway begins to piece together that the perpetrator Benjamin ORyan (Ben Kingsley) is pursuing serial killers and seems to possess some sort of extra-sensory powers. In the midst of their cat-and-mouse game though the prey keeps dangling clues baiting an increasingly frustrated agent tormented by his own rose-colored visions. ""You want me to see what you see"" Mackelway says as he sifts through the breadcrumbs. Shown at first through dizzyingly extreme close-ups Kingsley has the crazed look of a man experiencing the tortures of the damned and with its eerie music and seemingly disconnected string of killings pic sustains interest for a brief while. The pacing however creeps along too slowly with a stale emphasis on gauzy images as Mackelway and ORyan ""see"" events -- a poor mans version of ground trodden by ""Red Dragon"" as well as its earlier (and better) incarnation ""Manhunter."" Merhige rightfully won praise for his visual style on ""Vampire"" but here the various gimmicks do little to advance the story. Nor does the narrative do an especially good job of developing and focusing in on the intriguing idea of ""suspect zero"" a serial killer who follows no discernible pattern and thus might be responsible for an inordinate number of those missing faces on milk cartons. At times in fact the story feels like two movies compacted into one either of which might have been more satisfying on its own. For the most part ""Suspect Zero"" is structured as a two-character piece with Moss barely along for the ride and one of her ""The Matrix"" series co-stars Harry Lennix cast in the highly predictable role of Mackelways overly hostile boss huffily snapping orders about making progress pronto. Merhige does exercise admirable restraint in depicting the slayings which manage to convey a sense of grisliness without being excessively graphic. Indeed the only real overkill resides in the credits featuring no fewer than 11 producers including a half-dozen exec producers. Notably the listed contributors also prominently cite a ""remote viewing"" consultant who one would think should have foreseen at least some of these deficiencies coming.
