Comments Alone in the Dark Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff the reigning princes of Hollywood schlock join forces in this brain-dead adaptation of a popular video game. It opens with a scrolling expository title so long and involved I began to wonder if it was a gag then Slater takes over as a detective of the paranormal whos nosing around a natural history museum full of Native American artifacts. Dorff plays the commander of the local ghostbusters who race around in body armor and spray bullets at marauding reptilian bipeds. Uwe Boll directed. R 96 min. By J.R.

Take this video-game adaptation which follows paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Slater) as he battles with demons worshiped by an ancient tribe. Carnby enlists the expertise of his ex an anthropologist played by Tara Reid donning dark-rimmed glasses and presumably a brain. Any chance for suspense is thwarted by gratuitous violence heavy-metal-propelled action sequences and laughably flat dialogue between characters who are barely more developed than in the Atari version.

Its so bad its postmodern. Its about monsters that live in the dark and cause lights to flicker making them roughly as terrifying as the Clapper. Oh did I mention the zombies? On a related note Alone stars Christian Slater Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff all of whom do an excellent job maintaining consciousness -- okay except for Reid who evokes the slower moments of Awakenings. This film-like mass was directed by Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) for whom elocution is not a priority. (One character seems to say ""The knishes must be perfect Otherwise there could be...consequences."") Far be it from me to dismiss a mans effort in a sentence but the film on your teeth after a three-day drunk possesses more cinematic value.

But both films also squander the peculiar potential to become their own kind of camp classics. ""Hide and Seek"" features a pedigreed cast that includes not only De Niro but the gifted young actress Dakota Fanning as well as such respected supporting players as Amy Irving Elisabeth Shue and Dylan Baker. It possesses the sleek production values and sophisticated look of several modern-day horror movies -- from ""Rosemarys Baby"" to ""What Lies Beneath"" -- that seem part of a plot by the denizens of Beverly Hills to instill in the great unwashed a primal fear of expensive homes. Christian Slater and Tara Reid -- in the role of sexy archaeologist -- battle underground monsters in ""Alone in the Dark."" (Chris Helcermanas-benge) _____More in Movies_____  Hide and Seek Reviews and Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Oscars Coverage  Arts amp; Living Movies _____More in Movies_____  Alone in the Dark Reviews and Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Oscars Coverage  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now And the first two-thirds of ""Hide and Seek"" are admittedly pretty good. De Niro plays a recently widowed psychologist who moves with his 9-year-old daughter Emily (Fanning) to a rambling Victorian farmhouse in Upstate New York so the girl can recover from her mothers death. Fanning (""I Am Sam"" ""Man on Fire"") whose light hair is darkened here and whose angelic face has been maquillaged to a waxy pallor does an outstanding job of playing a hollow-eyed basket case; you know ""Hide and Seek"" is taking you to the dark side when everyone keeps calling her a ""cute kid"" -- nothing could be further from the truth. De Niro whose performances can never exactly be described as bad delivers the kind of instantly forgettable turn that reminds viewers hes made films like ""Falling in Love"" and ""The Fan."" Director John Polson (""Swimfan"") does a good job of gradually ratcheting up the tension as Emily befriends a mysterious person named Charlie. As strange things begin to happen its anyones guess just whos behind them the creepy real estate guy the creepy sheriff or the creepy neighbor. But when the big -- and it turns out utterly predictable -- reveal occurs high class briefly gives way to high camp which then itself dissipates to an anticlimactic thud. ""Alone in the Dark"" a supremely idiotic B-movie sewn haphazardly together from the tattered shreds of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" and ""28 Days Later"" stars Christian Slater and the aforementioned Miss Reid (or more accurately her midriff) as a couple that run afoul of subterranean creatures that look like theyd taste good broiled with a bit of drawn butter. Slater plays a former government agent whose search for the remains of an ancient tribe coincides with a mad scientists plot to destroy -- or at least inconvenience -- the Bay Area. Reid who plays an archaeologist and telegraphs her characters intellect by wearing glasses and putting her hair in a bun gets to say things like ""I started deciphering the pictogram for you."" The rest of the cast (which includes the once-promising actor Stephen Dorff) zip around in stylish paramilitary gear and say things like ""Defend the perimeter"" and ""Roger that"" all in the course of the utterly uninvolving pursuit of utterly nonsensical creatures from the Black Whatever. At times ""Alone in the Dark"" veers tantalizingly close to being one of those movies that is so bad its good but in the end its so bad its just . . . bad. ""Some doors are meant to stay shut"" Reid says at one point. Roger that. Hide and Seek (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for frightening sequences and violence. Alone in the Dark (96 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence and profanity.

FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Notre Musique Documentary-drama. Starring Sarah Adler Simon Eine and Jean-Luc Godard. Written and directed by Godard. (In French and Spanish with English subtitles. Not rated. 79 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). Exercising the prerogative of a director who appears in his own movie Jean-Luc Godard gives himself the best scene in ""Notre Musique"" a lumpy mix of real-life and fictional events that shows age hasnt diminished the famed filmmakers zeal to experiment. In the documentary portion Godard captures himself pontificating to students in Sarajevo. Its a mind-boggling lecture -- jumping from the visions of Bernadette to the vision of director Howard Hawks whom Godard claims saw no difference between men and women. He illustrates with slides of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in virtually identical shots from Hawks ""His Girl Friday."" ""Truth has two faces"" Godard says stopping just short of exclaiming ""Eureka"" The students dutifully take notes which surely will require some head-scratching to decipher. Like Godards overstuffed talk his latest movie suffers from an excess of ideas that are hard to sort out. Using Dantes model ""Notre Musique"" is divided into three parts. The first hell is a hellish montage of war images some real some taken from movies such as ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Kiss Me Deadly. "" The devastation suffered by American Indians figures prominently and to connect the dots they reappear in part two purgatory when Israeli journalist Judith (Sarah Adler) imagines them in tribal headdresses reclaiming the land stolen from them. Like Michael Moore Godard makes no attempt to hide his political leanings but he tilts too far in this unintentionally laughable fantasy sequence. Judith is in Sarajevo to track down the French ambassador (Simon Eine) and tell him shes the daughter of the baby born in his garret during World War II when he provided refuge for a Jewish couple trapped in Vichy France. Their exchange during a reception for a cigar-smoking Godard and fellow speakers at a literary conference is conceived as a dramatic high point with Judith pressuring the diplomat to be interviewed about the Palestinian situation from the perspective of a Nazi resister. But Adler and Eine play the scene flatly and theres little emotional payoff when the ambassador resists the request out of fear that anything he says would become a diplomatic cause celebre. Its not even clear whose side a die-hard liberal is supposed to be on. A far more intriguing brief encounter occurs at the same party. As one hostess serves champagne to a professor he unexpectedly grabs her hand and they begin to dance. Their spin around the room recalls a famous scene in Godards 1964 ""Band of Outsiders"" -- back when he was still making breathless cinema -- of three bar patrons spontaneously doing a line dance called the Madison. (Quentin Tarantino paid homage to this celebrated celluloid moment by having Uma Thurman do the Madison in ""Pulp Fiction."") The few movies Godard has made in recent years arent big on fun although ""Notre Musique"" does conclude in heaven imagined as a surreally bright green forest. When you start in hell theres no way to go except up. -- Advisory This film contains brutal war scenes. - Ruthe Stein Alone in the Dark Action-horror. Starring Christian Slater Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff. Directed by Uwe Boll. (R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). ""Alone in the Dark"" is the best Ed Wood movie never made. It fails so miserably as both an action and horror picture that it succeeds as a comedy. Its a film so mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality. Just how bad/good is this movie? Perpetual Maxim cover girl Tara Reid not only plays an archaeologist but she also utters the phrase ""I need to study these artifacts"" and on multiple occasions saves the good guys by translating ancient American Indian scripture. No Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie do not show up to perform brain surgery in ""Alone in the Dark"" but you will fully expect to find that deleted scene on the DVD. The movie begins with an incredibly long scroll of text explaining a backstory involving a portal to another dimension an unspeakable evil and orphans who were used as scientific experiments. Just when you think every possible cliche has been used in the first five minutes Christian Slater shows up as one of those orphans who has grown up to become a loose-cannon member of a paranormal investigation team and gets thrown off the job. From the moment Slater appears its clear this movie is going to be telling-your-friends-about-it-the-next-day weird. For starters the ""Pump up the Volume"" star dresses as if hes raided the wardrobe truck from an early 1990s Jean-Claude Van Damme movie running through most of ""Alone in the Dark"" in a black ribbed tank top jeans and brown leather trench coat. At least half of the actors dialogue appears to have been written for the movie poster tagline. (""Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive"") The rest of his lines are delivered in sporadic voice-overs which seem to have been added in postproduction to spackle in the giant plot holes created by director Uwe Boll. Lets talk about Boll. What the young director has created here is more of a drinking game than a movie with scenes that are not only laughably bad but also repeat themselves. A team of soldiers blows up a hallway full of priceless artwork. (Take a drink.) Reid uses a four-syllable science word when its clear from her confused delivery that she has no idea what it means. (Drink.) Slater utters yet another cryptic line about his fear of the dark. (Drink.) Seriously Boll appears to have one goal here and thats convincing Tim Burton to film a biopic about him. ""Alone in the Dark"" is the directors second movie based on a video game and he has at least two more on the way. But no one could create anything this weird without someone else with an established background in bad cinema. And sure enough the credits list screenwriter Elan Matsai who also wrote a film called ""MVP2 Most Vertical Primate."" This movie gets an empty chair but it just as easily could have received a clapping guy and probably would have if there were any acknowledgement in the production notes that the whole thing was supposed to be a joke. Add a few oral sex jokes and replace the actors with marionettes and ""Alone in the Dark"" could end up with rave reviews as a sequel to ""Team America World Police."" While the movie isnt quite bad enough to be considered the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of the 21st century its not overstating matters to call ""Alone in the Dark"" this generations ""C.H.U.D."" Every casting decision camera angle special effect and sound seems created as a dare to leave the theater. The fight choreography appears to have been taken from an episode of ""Lost in Space"" the musical score sounds as if it were composed on a 1983 Casio keyboard bought at a garage sale and even the extras seem as if they were selected for their background incompetence. On second thought you probably need to see this movie for yourself. If nothing else its worth the bargain-matinee price to watch Slater utter the line ""Theres a price to pay for bringing darkness back into the light."" (Drink.) -- Advisory This film contains profanity violence body mutilation and bad dialogue. - Peter Hartlaub Veer-Zaara Drama. Starring Shahrukh Khan Preity Zinta Rani Mukerji Kirron Kher Divya Dutta Boman Irani and Anupam Kher. Directed by Yash Chopra. (In Hindi with English subtitles. Not rated. 192 minutes plus intermission. At the Balboa Theater.). An epic love story thats also an astute commentary on India-Pakistan relations ""Veer-Zaara"" is a three-hour flurry across countries time and matters of the heart. Technically speaking the film is a Bollywood production (which means the characters break into song on occasion) but the acting drama plot twists and cinematography can be compared (favorably) to that of many major Western productions from Saul Zaentzs ""The English Patient"" to Jean-Pierre Jeunets ""A Very Long Engagement."" ""Veer-Zaara"" begins in a lush countryside where a handsome couple -- Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) and Zaara Hayaat Khan (Preity Zinta) -- are frolicking. Obviously in love they seem to be living in paradise -- except that its a flashback to what was. What is Singh languishes in a Pakistani jail where hes been locked up for 22 years. We learn that Singh was a rescue pilot with the Indian Air Force and that Khan is from a prominent Muslim family in Pakistan. They met when Khan took a trip to India to spread the ashes of her beloved Sikh nanny. As Singh sits on the cold prison floor a Pakistani lawyer named Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji) comes in and vows to win his release from the silent hell his life has become. Director Yash Chapor one of Bollywoods most cherished figures uses flashbacks to tell the story of Singhs and Khans unexpected romance. Road blocks to their relationship were set in place from the beginning. Besides being from countries that have fought three wars Singh and Khan have roots in different religions Khan is already engaged to a Pakistani man whom her father has decreed she marry and Singhs connection to the Indian military makes him a target of suspicion among certain Pakistanis. Still their love is so strong that its obvious to anyone who sees them -- including Khans mother and Singhs surrogate parents. Two decades later the overriding question is this Can Siddiqui a female lawyer working on her first case figure out the mystery of Khans imprisonment (and overcome the prejudice of misogynistic jailers and a rival lawyer)? ""Veer-Zaara"" is so arresting its scenes so full of beauty and colors that the three hours go by almost too fast. While Bollywood films have had a mixed reception in the United States this one deserves a wide audience. A film that lets audiences see the humanity in characters who represent ""the other"" -- and does it in a way thats dramatic funny fun silly musical stylish romantic and redemptive -- is a film worth telling your friends and neighbors about. - Jonathan Curiel Fear X Thriller. Starring John Turturro James Remar and Deborah Kara Unger. Written by Nicolas Winding Refn and Hubert Selby Jr. and directed by Refn. (Not rated. 91 minutes. At the Roxie.). The truth sometimes will not set you free. So discovers a mall security guard (a subtle John Turturro) when he goes in search of the man who murdered his wife in this quietly effective thriller. Nicolas Winding Refn the films youthful Danish director was fortunate enough to secure the services of the inspired musician Brian Eno whose spare synthesized score along with restrained camera work anchor the movie. The most compelling scenes show Turturros lonely haunted character Harry at home obsessed with trying to piece together the mystery of his wifes death. Harry lives in a dream state of sorts one minute examining surveillance videos for evidence of the murder the next having chilling visions of his wife in a nearby room. It makes for unsettling stuff -- and certainly deserves a better title than the lame ""Fear X."" Things for Harry get more complicated -- and muddled -- when he leaves wintry gloomy Wisconsin to track down the killer in wintry gloomy Montana. The people Harry asks questions of arent especially keen to answer and he stays in a spooky hotel whose red walls and carpeting should have been warning enough that he just might be entering a situation thats straight out of ""The Shining."" Though it was co-written by Hubert Selby Jr. (the author of ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" who died last year) the story in the end is less than satisfying and unfortunately doesnt match the movies eerie style. -- Advisory This film contains violent scenes. - John McMurtrie Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 3 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 4 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 5 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 6 Trump Jr. accuses Obama of plagiarizing a line from his speech 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Man beaten unconscious in SF confrontation over urination 9 The Latest Trump slams Clinton over radical Islam 10 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 2 killed 2 missing Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News E.

"Awful Dark should be relegated to obscurity - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Awful Dark should be relegated to obscurity By Janice Page Globe Correspondent  |  January 28 2005 Think of the lamest horror movie youve ever seen. Now think of Tara Reid in the lamest horror movie youve ever seen. See how much worse it could have been?That folks is the level of pee-yew were talking when we evaluate Alone in the Dark"" a thrill-less mess of a movie based on a video game starring American Pie"" alum Reid and once-promising actor Christian Slater as the last best hopes for saving humankind.So lets just get through this quickly shall we?Production notes tell us that the creator of Ataris H.P. Lovecraft-inspired Alone in the Dark"" fourth installment (The New Nightmare"") handpicked German director Uwe Boll for the games film adaptation because Boll recently brought Segas House of the Dead"" to the big screen.Apparently it didnt matter that House of the Dead"" is roundly considered an unwatchable movie or that online chat rooms are full of angry postings from horror fans and video gamers who label Boll a hack. This filmmaker has found his talent-defying niche and more of his video-game adaptations (including BloodRayne"") are in the works like it or not.In Alone in the Dark"" Bolls organizational and creative shortcomings are made all the more insufferable by a laughable yet unfunny script cobbled together by fledgling screenwriters Elan Mastai Michael Roesch and Peter Scheerer. The plot involves an ancient tribe of demon-worshipers semi-invisible lizard-like creatures trapped between worlds orphans who are the victims of heinous scientific experiments greedy treasure hunters and top-secret government agents.Slater plays Edward Carnby a paranormal investigator who was among the victimized orphans though his memory of those days is spotty. All he knows is that being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive."" Well that and the vast arsenal of weapons he keeps in his loft apartment for impromptu firefights with monsters zombies and the federal storm troopers he used to work for.Reid is a brainy anthropologist named Aline which is totally believable because she sometimes wears glasses and has her hair pulled back in a bun plus she purses her lips before she says such informed things as Some doors are meant to stay shut."" Aline and Ed are old flames who reignite amid the supernatural chaos sort of like an unwanted dumpster fire.Theres a whole head-splitting multi-tentacled story line that requires several unintentionally hilarious paragraphs of introduction read out loud at the top of the film. Its beyond pointless to try to reconstruct or deconstruct that nonsense here.Alone in the Dark"" presents splatter fans with garden-variety gore and gives action-horror fans loud unscary special effects (no more frightening when glimpsed in flashing light it can be noted) rather than genuine suspense or bang.Tara Reid fans though get the promise of a sequel.Janice Page can be reached at jpage22hotmail.com.Alone in the Dark1/2  (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

It has something to do with the hideous killer velociraptor-meets-the-Alien creatures that are now threatening the earth. Hes been kicked out of 713 a government agency created to deal with paranormal phenomena (with special emphasis on the paranormal in bad movies). But since these creatures and bad guys (humans who have been implanted with icky wiggly wormlike implants that enter their spine) keep trying to kill him he has to continue the good fight anyway. This means reuniting with estranged 713 Commander Richards (Stephen Dorff) and other allies including paranormal scientist helpmate Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid). The movies based on a video game (of the same name) and so like those modes of entertainment the action consists mostly of ""Look there Monster Shoot Shoot again Oh go ahead shoot a lot Ooh another"" etc. This is definitely for people who 1) love the video game 2) think Slater and Dorff are eminently watchable no matter what bad flick theyre in and 3) are wearing industrial-strength ear plugs. Im not sure why Edward and his motley allies get so freaked out about these critters.

Derivative bloodbath jettisons the games atmospheric suspense and Lovecraftian sense of the macabre in favor of slasher movie mayhem wit-free dialogue and endlessly protracted and gory shootouts. Fans of the source material probably wont be switching platforms to catch this bizarre Lions Gate pickup and non-fans definitely wont. Very loosely based on a classic computer-game trilogy that revolutionized horror-adventure gaming in the 1990s ""Alone in the Dark"" offers ample evidence that ""House of the Dead"" helmer Uwe Boll should put down his joystick -- quickly before anyone else gets hurt. Derivative bloodbath jettisons the games atmospheric suspense and Lovecraftian sense of the macabre in favor of slasher movie mayhem wit-free dialogue and endlessly protracted and gory shootouts. Fans of the source material probably wont be switching platforms to catch this bizarre Lions Gate pickup and non-fans definitely wont. One of the few elements salvaged from the original series is the central character independent paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) who as revealed in flashback was one of 20 orphans subjected to gruesome medical experimentation. Twenty-two years later Carnby is a troubled chronically paranoid man who when hes not trying to solve occult crimes spends his time searching the globe for dangerous artifacts. Carnby returns home with his latest acquisition and is immediately attacked by a madman in sunglasses who has to be shot impaled and hurled through multiple glass windows before he finally succumbs. Soon all 19 of Carnbys former fellow orphans are reported missing and theres a deadly monster attack on the museum where Carnbys girlfriend brainy anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) works. Shes convinced the creatures -- as well as the mysterious golden relic Carnby has just brought back from Chile -- are somehow linked to the Abkani a sophisticated but now-extinct Indian tribe that long ago opened the gate to some unidentified evil force. Also figuring into the increasingly nonsensical plot are a friendly coroner (Frank C. Turner) the ambitious Professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker) and an official squad of paranormal agents known as Bureau 713 where Carnby used to work before turning renegade. The bureau is represented by macho jerk Cmdr. Burke (Stephen Dorff) and staffed by lots of desk-bound ciphers who blurt things like ""Electromagnetics off the scale sir Ive never seen anything like it"" Alas most auds have and far too often. With production values as inconsistent as its tone pic reps a schizoid hybrid of action genres morphing from supernatural chiller to zombie thriller to ""Indiana Jones""-style escapade in roughly that order. Early scenes rip off the slow-motion fight choreography of ""The Matrix"" while some of the later sequences are so choppy they could have been influenced by direct-to-video release ""Starship Troopers 2 Heroes of the Federation."" As for the monsters which have the power to distort electricity (conveniently causing the lights to flicker ominously every time one approaches) theyre impressively grotesque and hydra-like even if they do look like rejected conceptual sketches from the ""Alien"" series. Slater holds down his end of the frame admirably embodying a flat character with stripped-down action-hero panache. Not so his female co-star Reid who faces the monumental task of playing a superintelligent hottie and who unfortunately adds unintentional humor as she scribbles notes on a clipboard wearing a pair of owlish specs. If theres one way pic improves on vidgame its in the high-resolution graphics These have to be some of the youngest buffest most gorgeously tanned scientists on record. In all other respects ""Alone in the Dark"" offers no surprises and zero replay value.
