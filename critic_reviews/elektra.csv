"The sweetness of In Good Company. Slate Sign In Sign Up The sweetness of In Good Company. The sweetness of In Good Company. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 13 2005 610 PM The Tender Ways of Corporate Sharks In Good Company sweetens smarmy capitalists. By David Edelstein A hard-shell candy movie with a soft center Death of a Salesman Glengarry Glenn Ross Salesmen carry a lot of freight in plays and movies about our economic unease and why shouldnt they? Theyre at the axis of our capitalist way of life Theyre the middlemen between fickle corporate goliaths and fickle consumers. Theyre also the first to fall and fall ignominiously No leader boasts about casualties in war but deep-six a few hundred sales managers--with their ""bloated salaries""--and the market huzzahs. Paul Weitzs In Good Company (Universal) is a liberal-humanist sitcom set in a brutal global-capitalist universe. The movie doesnt cut too deep and its impossibly sweetened so that most of the characters get their just desserts. But it manages to be funny and charming while capturing a lot of disturbing things about the way we live now our deepest fears about our place in a system that could force us to clean out our desks (if we even have desks) at the drop of a stock point. Dennis Quaid plays Dan Forman the old-fashioned 51-year-old head of ad sales at a sports magazine clearly modeled on Sports Illustrated. How old-fashioned is Dan? In the first scene he simply hands a copy of his magazine to a former advertiser (Philip Baker Hall) and walks away shocking the CEO by announcing that its quality will speak for itself. Now I dont know that Dan could make it these days at a place like Time-Warner In Good Company has a whiff of the early 80s when the old guard watched in horror as the first wave of M.B.A. barbarians stormed the gate. But the terror is certainly timeless of slick young men who bring a sort of macho triumphalism to laying people off--who admiringly refer to one another as ""chain saw maniacs"" and ""Ninja assassins."" Advertisement The assassins of In Good Company are sent in by a multinational mogul called Teddy K. (the reliably satanic Malcolm McDowell) whose agents demote Dan and appoint Carter Duryea (Topher Grace)--a 26-year-old with no sales experience but one marketing coup dinosaur-shaped cell phones for 5-year-olds. Carter has a mandate to cut jobs and raise revenue as he explains to the older man while force-feeding him sushi. (Thats another 80s throwback Dan seems never to have seen the stuff.) The chummy upstart tells Dan hell be ""an awesome wing-man"" and reminds him when challenged that hes lucky to have kept his job. (Dans late-fortysomething wife played by Marg Helgenberger is improbably expecting a child and theyve just taken out a second mortgage to pay for their older daughters college tuition.) Carter isnt vacuous but hes still a smarmy capitalist tool. He hasnt thought through the meaning of Teddy K.s corporate mantra ""synergy"" which is the movies bogeyman word. Synergy is used here like ""melanoma"" Its anti-human it spreads and it squeezes out the good guys in an unholy monopoly. In its face Quaids Dan is the stubborn voice of humanism while Graces Carter stands for all that is amoral and rapacious-- Well hold on Carter isnt much of a rapacious antagonist actually. Grace cut his teeth on That 70s Show and hes a puppy-eyed actor with an appealing self-consciousness. He dithers adorably; he could be Robert Downey Jr.s kid brother--Downey without the danger with a soft center. In Good Company is supposed to be about Carters conversion from corporate machine to man but theres no real drama or suspense because the script has him lovably confessing his insecurities right from the get-go. The twist is that Carter confesses those fears to Dans college-sophomore daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson) who subsequently invites him up to her dorm room. So Dan is losing both his place in the world and his darling little girl to this punk and Quaid plays the patriarchal anxiety (and rage) with just enough style to keep it funny and just enough realism to keep it affecting. He has a great exchange with Alex He tells her he liked her better when she was 5 and she says ""Thats an awful thing to say."" And he just stands at glowers at her unable to speak. He knows what he said is awful. But she gave herself to his boss his usurper. Advertisement Carter isnt much of a usurper though. He doesnt sneer at Dan and say ""Nyah nyah Ive screwed your daughter."" Hes abashed sheepish and genuinely smitten with the young woman. Thats the sweetened part of In Good Company that both men are the movies protagonists nice guys wanting the same good things for themselves and all mankind forced by the system into brutal competition. So the movie has a soft center too. Weitz who also wrote the screenplay makes mistakes in the pacing and lets the film run down but theyre the mistakes of a director who likes his characters and his actors too much. (James L. Brooks was similarly indulgent in his much-maligned Spanglish.) In how neatly it plays out In Good Company is very much a corporate middlebrow Hollywood product. But theres an honorable place for a writer-director who can work within the system and criticize it too who can remind you of arbitrary economic injustice in the context of a romantic fairy tale. That strikes me as some honest synergy. Speaking of Ninja assassins Make way for Elektra (20th Century Fox) the new wannabe Marvel superhero franchise starring Jennifer Garner as a wraithlike red-swathed three-pronged-dagger-wielding avenger. In last weeks New York Times Virginia Heffernan neatly filleted TVs Alias and its star Garner arguing that its action-hero template has gotten old fast and that youd have to be riveted by the actress face and its two expressions--dimply and solemn--to stay hooked. Virginia might want to avoid Elektra in which Garner keeps her dimples under wraps. But Im bound to say that I see the allure. That face is really strange--long and fish-lipped with different planes going at different angles. Shes like a Picasso guppy. I dig her slinky dancers torso too; it keeps her supple in her stiffness. Elektra isnt half-bad--only maybe two-fifths. It isnt the fault of the able director Rob Bowman or the script or the actors. ... Its just that these Marvel pictures are starting to blur together. Superhero with a buried trauma ... Gods loneliest man/woman ... murdered parents ... martial-arts ... fast-food Zen homilies ... gloating super-villain. Elektra was killed off in the tragic finale of last years Daredevil but the blind martial-arts master Stick (Terence Stamp) resurrected her--and then rejected her for being too violent. Or is this some kind of test to see if her heart is pure? So far shes flunking. As an amoral assassin she slays scores of people her entrances heavily fetishized a glimpse of red a whoosh of silk a tantalizing piece of bodice strands of hair blowing in a cosmic wind. Solemn indeed. But something tells you those dimples are under there somewhere. There is one good exchange which is in the trailer ""Elektra--like the tragedy Your parents must have had a sense of humor."" ""Not really."" And there is one good special effect The villain called ""Tattoo"" unleashes birds of prey wolves and snakes from his painted body. (Computers were made for effects like that.) But Elektra is otherwise ho-hum. It hits its marks but it has none of the surreal delirium of the Hong Kong pictures that obviously inspired it--A Chinese Ghost Story The Bride With White Hair The Heroic Trio. It needs some personality some flakiness some genuine weirdness. Elektra is supposed to have obsessive-compulsive disorder to the point where she even counts her steps. But in the context of the movie that doesnt look bizarre It seems deeply in tune with whole mechanical paint-by-numbers construction. There isnt a whisper of spontaneity.

But what about a sermon thats worth preaching in a movie that might actually have social utility? ""Coach Carter"" will win no awards for craftsmanship. The storytelling is clumsy. Credulity is sometimes stretched beyond the breaking point. So is patience The running time is 134 minutes. Yet the unusual -- and admirable -- aspect of this story about an inspirational basketball coach is the nakedness of the message it sends to sports-besotted kids (as well as parents) in the inner cities and everywhere else. Student athletes the coach insists must first be successful students. Elite athletes must not be tolerated as sacred monsters exempt from the law. And kids in order to thrive must be raised with the twin constraints of academic discipline and parental responsibility. Samuel L. Jackson plays a fictionalized version of Ken Carter a high school basketball star in the 1970s who two decades later took a coaching job at his old school in the Bay Area town of Richmond Calif. In his own career which spans more than two decades Mr. Jackson has played many variations on the theme of drill sergeant and this is one of them. A ramrod-straight authority figure with a shaved head tailored suits and tasteful ties Carter declaims sternly rather than speaks; does not use contractions; assigns pushups and sprints by the tens of thousands; calls his players ""sir"" as theyre expected to call him and requires them to sign contracts which to their shock and dismay he enforces to the letter of his Draconian law. Thus the wannabe Kobes (for worse or better) and the would-be Shaqs must wear shirts and ties on game days attend classes regularly sitting in the front row and maintain at least a 2.3-grade-point average. None of this goes down well in Richmond a working-class community where sports dull the pain of endemic poverty even though the coach has turned a team of quarrelsome losers into spectacular winners. And it goes down very badly when Carter responds to the academic failure of some of his players by locking the whole team out of the gym and canceling their games. Clearly ""Coach Carter"" which was written by Mark Schwahn and John Gatins and directed by Thomas Carter -- no relative -- is a smart entertainment that trades on Mr. Jacksons forceful presence a cast of extremely likable young actors and lots of basketball action. (I mean lots. Hoops-averse patrons need not apply.) Whats less clear is its potential on other levels since the off-court drama can get awfully silly -- a facile resolution to a romantic crisis involving abortion a postgame party of pseudo-Fellini-esque decadence. Yet we live in an age when kids sometimes learn from movies what theyve failed to learn from books. Just as ""Saving Private Ryan"" became a textbook on World War II ""Coach Carter"" may serve as a lesson plan. The Chorus Feel-good movies come in many flavors and languages. ""The Chorus"" (""Les Choristes"") is in French with English subtitles but it speaks to its audience most eloquently in the universal language of music. The year is 1949 and the setting is a bleak provincial boarding school for incorrigible boys -- a reformatory really. Still the plot will feel familiar to those who remember ""Mr. Hollands Opus."" A mild-mannered music teacher Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) reports for duty on the faculty and notwithstanding the scornful opposition of the schools tyrannical director proves the students to be corrigible by getting them to raise their voices -- gorgeously -- in a chorus. If Im laying that out too glibly its because most of the film a debut feature directed by Christophe Barratier is quite shamelessly formulaic. ""The Chorus"" redeems itself though with Mr. Jugnots astute understated performance -- his sad-clown quality reminds me of an American comic from another era the late Jimmy Savo -- and with that most perishable of musical beauties the singing of boy sopranos. Elektra Before the lights went down at a screening of ""Elektra"" which stars Jennifer Garner as the Marvel Comics warrior of the same name I read enough of the production notes to learn that Elektra possesses no superhuman powers. Instead she relies on her martial arts skills which include throwing knives and ""in addition she has the ability to see into the future a skill known as Kimagure."" Well doesnt seeing into the future count as superhuman? I hope so because shortly after the movie began I realized that I too possessed the skill known as Kimagure. I could see clearly -- all too clearly -- that ""Elektra"" would be long on cutlery and decor (including of course the marvelously decorative Ms. Garner of the TV series ""Alias"") and woefully short on narrative though thats not quite true if youre happy with a back story thats far more detailed than the front story. Jennifer Garner deserves better than this especially after her striking but brief appearance opposite Ben Affleck in ""Daredevil"" a film in which Elektra died. Im glad that death proved no impediment to her presence in this Affleck-less sequel and a vivid presence it is given Ms. Garners physical grace in Elektras battles against devilish creatures that can vanish in a puff of smoke. But the movies dominant visual tone is bronzed grunge and its emotional tone is depressive. (Elektra has childhood issues to work through.) ""You understand violence and pain"" her blind sensei tells her ""but you do not know the way."" I do not understand violence and pain but I know boredom.    DVD TIP ""Hoosiers"" (1986) was directed by David Anspaugh from a screenplay by Angelo Pizzo. Rich with themes of struggle and redemption the story inspired by fact centers on Gene Hackmans Norman Dale who coaches a small-town high school basketball team to big success. Dennis Hopper is the alcoholic father of one of the teams leading players and Barbara Hershey is a schoolteacher with whom Coach Dale falls in love.

Comments Elektra Jennifer Garner who played the Marvel Comics superhero Elektra in Daredevil (2003) returns to the role for this sleek action adventure protecting a father (Goran Visnjic) and daughter (Kirsten Prout) from the nefarious schemes and ninjitsu techniques of the Hand. This doesnt exactly set the world on fire but I was charmed by its old-fashioned storytelling which is refreshingly free of archness self-consciousness or Kill Bill-style wisecracks. Some of the effects recall vintage Ray Harryhausen the villains all perish in puffs of green smoke and Garners sincere glumness suggests Buster Crabbe in Flash Gordon.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Over the past few years its been a pleasure to see some Marvel Comics characters get the big-screen treatments they deserve. The X-Men series the Spider-Man films and Ang Lees underappreciated Hulk all found ways to transplant their iconic heroes to film while still staying true to comic-book tradition. But with other franchises like The Punisher and Daredevil Marvel has stayed true to another kind of tradition The long stretch in the 70s and 80s when anyone with two nickels and a camera could license a Marvel character for a movie. The Daredevil spin-off Elektra shoves Frank Millers eponymous cold-blooded assassin into a PG-13-friendly adventure. Its not a comfortable fit but the film isnt really about comfortable fits. Its most striking image is that of star Jennifer Garner squeezed into a red bustier and high-heeled combat boots looking like the worlds deadliest hooker. And though shes proven herself a remarkably adaptive actress elsewhere Garner looks uneasy in the part in or out of her superheroine costume. The role needs a steely inhuman reserve and Garners innate likeability works against her. Even when shes taking aim with a bow and arrow she looks like she might be thinking about kittens. As the film opens Garner has conveniently risen from the dead and decided her resurrection gives her an opportunity to become a highly paid assassin. But her conscience gets the better of her when shes assigned to kill a father (Goran Visnjic) and his 13-year-old daughter (Kirsten Prout). Attempting to rescue them instead shes unexpectedly aided by her old sensei (Terence Stamp) and opposed by a mysterious band of ninjas working for an organization called The Hand. Action ensues most of it lifted badly from better recent films (e.g. Hero and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) by veteran X-Files director Rob Bowman and staged with all the energy of used chewing gum. A villain code-named Tattoo who naturally enough has the ability to make his tattoos come alive enlivens the proceedings for a while. But Garners main opposition comes from Will Yun Lee playing a baddie with the superhuman ability to speak only in cliches. ""We meet again"" he exclaims when they meet again. ""It ends now"" he shouts shortly before the film ends. If only hed thought of that one sooner. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Monsieur N.

She died in Daredevil but is resurrected by her blind ex-sensei and mentor Stick (Stamp). Initially a nihilistic loner Elektra gets to show her touchy-feely side when instead of slaying Mark Miller (Visnjic) and his bratty 13-year old daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout) she saves them from The Hands acrobatic Ninja assassins. Elektra sees herself in the troubled rebellious Abby who also lost her mother at a young age. Aaaah. Apparently director Bowman wanted the audience to root for Elektra to triumph over her own inner darkness. Big mistake. What they want to see is Elektra beating the shit out of villain Kirigi (Yun Lee) and his X-Men-style side-kicks disease-dealing Typhoid man-mountain Stone bendy-boy Kinkou and the animalistic Tattoo. Instead the kick-ass gets sidelined while Elektra battles with her emotions. The influence of Far Eastern martial arts movies is everywhere apparent the forest scene in which multiple assassins glide down from the treetops is lifted directly from House of Flying Daggers.

""I guess its all true"" he says. ""The red outfit the knives."" By now the rote adaptation of second-tier Marvel is a slow-season tradition meant to satiate comic book fans while they wait for the summer blockbuster (in this case Julys Fantastic Four). The pedestrian Elektra offers no surprises and whether or not youll appreciate its modest charms depends entirely on whether you too have been anticipating Garners new outfit.On the still-underrated TV series Alias Garner plays CIA agent Sydney Bristow whose undercover assignments require more costume changes than a Cher concert. But besides techno-goth fashion Alias is about a vexed father-daughter relationship not unlike the one Elektra had with papa Natchios who was slain in 2003s dismal Daredevil but who appears here (different actor) in flashbacks to our anti-heroines manse youth. Garners Elektra is what vulnerable Syd might look like if she went rogue--a remote ascetic killer.Director Rob Bowman squanders the impressive comic facility Garner demonstrated in 13 Going on 30 saddling her with the OCD behavior and portentous self-control of a Michael Mann character. The nominal story wrapped in more unnecessary Star Wars allusions than Bowmans last feature Reign of Fire revolves around a supernatural cabal called the Hand which wants to turn a teenage girl with prodigious ninja abilities to the dark side or else destroy her.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News A couple of nifty images and physical action thats filmed with clarity raise hopes -- in the opening sequence at least -- that ""Elektra"" might be a distraction from the January doldrums. Our first glimpse of the assassin-heroine is a rustle of red and black cloth atop a roof in a snowstorm. When she enters the lair of the target shes stalking we see her as he does reflected from head to toe in a glass of scotch hes holding up to the firelight. Theres an emphasis in the opening on Elektra as a whispery presence. Jennifer Garner doesnt so much sneak into her targets fortress as materialize inside it. It makes a nice break from the bombast of most action movies. There are a couple of neat images later on too a deadly Sapphic kiss between Elektra and a villain whose touch causes the living to wither and die (the kiss takes place in a forest as green leaves fall off trees and create a shower of black around them); and an eagle tattoo that comes to life leaving its bearers chest. The sad thing about ""Elektra"" though is that it reveals that for all the millions of dollars now spent on them comic-book movies are being made with no more distinction than the cheapest old Saturday-afternoon serials. When studios werent sure whether comic-book movies would make money some care was actually taken to make the presentation something special. Thats how we got Tim Burtons two ""Batman"" movies. Now you see that type of care only intermittently in the first ""X-Men"" movie and despite their problems in that movies sequel and the first and second ""Spider-Man"" films. ""Elektra"" is more and more what comic-book fans and moviegoers in general are being fobbed off with. Elektra a martial-arts-trained assassin was created by Frank Miller while he was working on the ""Daredevil"" comic book (Garner also played the character in the 2003 ""Daredevil"" movie) and brought back to life for the comic series ""Elektra Assassin."" What exists of a plot here makes fleeting reference to Elektras resurrection at the hands of her old martial-arts master (played by Terence Stamp who even in tripe like this holds his status as one of the three or four most elegant men ever to step in front of a movie camera). And theres some Freudian mumbo jumbo about Elektras having lost her mother at an early age and coming to develop a relationship with a young girl who shows the same abilities she did. You Might Also Like Whats missing -- apart of course from a plot -- is any character development. The movie doesnt make it clear or plausible why Elektra decided to use her gifts to become a paid assassin. And when she finds that her next target is that sympatico young girl and the girls father (the winning Goran Visnjic not fully awake here) we havent at that point been made to feel the connection that compels her to become the teens protector. Nor do we much care about the young prodigy since the actor playing her Kirsten Prout is an unappealing kid whose affect is somewhere between goody-goody and bratty. Garners role is so underwritten that she has little to do in the nonfighting scenes but brood. Its impossible not to start thinking of Sydney Bristow in ""Alias"" not because of any limitation on Garners part but because the writers of that show always give us enough information to know whats going on in Sydneys mind when shes in one of her black moods. In the fighting scenes here as badly and chaotically directed by Rob Bowman as the action scenes in ""Alias"" are clear and clean Elektra might just be another one of Sydneys disguises -- albeit one that manages through the clumsiness of the filmmaking to be both cheesy and humorless. In the past comic-book fans have raised a ruckus whenever they felt one of their beloved icons was getting shortchanged in its translation to the screen. Sometimes unfairly -- they bitched about Michael Keaton in ""Batman"" before even seeing his performance (which was brilliant) and Keanu Reeves seems to be getting the same treatment for the upcoming ""Constantine"" solely because hes not British. Maybe studios just ignore comics fans now figuring they will always have complaints. Or maybe comics fans have seen so many lousy film adaptations (especially of Marvel characters) that they just feel beaten down. Its about time though for them to start raising some serious chat-room hell about the shoddy movies being marketed to them. If the studios are going to go to the trouble and expense of bringing those flat panels to life would a little craft and imagination be too much to ask of them?

Leah McLaren From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 14 2005 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Mar. 17 2009 214PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Elektra  Directed by Rob Bowman Written by Raven Metzner Frank Miller Zach Penn and Stu Zicherman Starring Jennifer Garner Goran Visnjic and Kirsten Prout Classification PG For the better part of this movie Elektra (Jennifer Garner) appears to be a sensible stylish young superhero. She pads around her rented West Coast beach house in simple black T-shirts and jeans doing yoga and eating fruit. That she is in fact a hired assassin on a 2-million contract killing is charmingly offset by the fact that she wears no makeup and ties her (albeit ridiculously) long brown hair back in a ponytail. Finally you might be tempted to think a female comic-book heroine without the high heels and cleavage. But dont hold your breath. Before you can say ""shazam"" the baddies have appeared and Elektra is tarted up in a red satin bustier and matching pair of low-rise pedal-pushers that would give Shania Twains stylist cause for concern. Maybe its prudish to ask but why is it that women in the movies can only kick bad-guy butt if they happen to be dressed up like hookers or house pets? Perhaps the key to female superpower begins with the ability to execute roundhouse kicks while zippered into PVC pants and gland-squashing lingerie. Elektra as you will know from your most recent conversation over the holidays with a pimply geeked-out teenage relative has no actual superpowers of her own. Her background as it is recapped in the movie is suitably tragic She grew up being pushed around by her father and weakly protected by her mother. After witnessing her mothers murder at the hands of a flying horned demon at an impressionable age Elektra is forever scarred and ends up with a case of obsessive compulsive disorder that causes her to count when she walks and arrange her toiletries in an overly anal way. During college she meets Matt Murdock (aka Daredevil) and the two fall briefly in love. After Elektras father is murdered they part only to meet again years later he as a bona fide superhero and she as a trauma-hardened assassin on the wrong side of the law. At the end of Daredevil the 2003 precursor to this movie fans will remember that Elektra fell victim to Bullseye a sociopath and long-time adversary of Daredevils. Hollywood however has a magical way of resuscitating the dead especially if it sees signs of a second life at the box office. And so it is that Elektra was made to rise again this time at the hands of a white-haired martial-arts master who imbues her with cool new Ninja powers (most notably kimagure an ability to see the future which she possesses in limited terms). And that if you can get your head around it is the monolithic back-story for this otherwise thinly plotted film. The action picks up with Elektra at the beach house waiting for word from her superiors. When she discovers her next targets are in fact the next-door neighbours a handsome single father (Goran Visnjic) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout) Elektra has a moral reckoning and abandons the assignment. She subsequently vows to protect Abbey and her father and in doing so takes on a new gang of assassins led by a malicious Asian Ninja master known only as the Hand. Each one of his gang members is gifted with a power each one more wildly ludicrous than the next. Tattoo is a hoodlum inked up with wild animals that come to life and attack on command. Typhoid a tarty goth with electric-blue porn-star press-on nails has the ability to annihilate her enemies by blowing them a contagious kiss of death -- and so on. Elektra fights off each one of these two-dimensional opponents using her signature method of defence -- an overchoreographed swirl of long hair and gleaming three-pronged daggers called sais. By the time she learns that her wards have a secret of their own it is too late -- Elektra has broken her vow of non-commitment and become emotionally attached to her new friends. She sees her younger self in Abbey and besides the dad is hot. Will Elektra live to see all of her emotional risks pay off? Will she finally get it on with the dad? Will she teach little Abbey the Ninja-mistresss method of dodging bullets in thigh-high stilettos? All these perfectly reasonable questions are left open-ended by the time Elektra limps to its conclusion. Evidently only the box office will decide.

"Elektra No Live Wire washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Elektra No Live Wire Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 14 2005 THERES SOMETHING blurry and vague at the heart of ""Elektra"" and Im not just talking about the climactic showdown between the superheroine of the title (Jennifer Garner looking like shes auditioning for a spot on the next Victorias Secret TV special) and her evil ninja nemesis Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) who runs digitally smeared circles around her as a blizzard of white bed sheets swirls in the background. Im also talking about critical plot points such as how exactly Elektra was resurrected from the dead after suffering seemingly mortal wounds at the end of ""Daredevil"" the 2003 movie based on the comic book series that first introduced her character. One possibility is that this story actually takes place before the action of that film. This of course isnt clear. Then again Elektra is shown in flashback lying on a slab as her blind-yet-all-seeing mentor known as the Stick (Terence Stamp) rests his healing hand on her lifeless-yet-sexy belly. Ah that explains it. Other blurry n vague bits include the following Why does Elektra a coldblooded hit woman by profession when we first meet her here suddenly change her mind after being hired to assassinate a stranger Mark (Goran Visnjic) and his daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout)? Is it because her would-be victim is tall dark and handsome or because he cooked her Christmas dinner and plied her with wine? Or is it because the girl reminds Elektra of herself as a child? (Flash back to hazy scenes of the death of Elektras own murdered parents.) Maybe its because Elektra another dark tortured superhero -- and arent they all these days? -- is good after all and only needed to have her maternal instincts jump-started to discover this. Theres also a lot of fuzzy pseudo-Taoist nonsense courtesy of the Stick -- who trained Elektra then booted her out of his warrior camp in the woods -- about finding ""the way."" Im sorry but blurry vague hazy fuzzy and smeary may sound like five of the Seven Dwarfs but they have no business being in a movie based on a comic book a medium known for being bold punchy graphic and full of vividly drawn details. At bare minimum youd expect the fight sequence to be moderately watchable not so under-lit and rapidly cut that you cant really tell whos hitting whom and with what. Ill give the movie this Kirigis henchmen are semi-cool and remain truest to the comic-book spirit. Employees of a coalition of underworld types known as the Hand who pursue Elektra when she becomes Mark and Abbys protector (for reasons that must remain murky in order to avoid spoiling the movies one interesting twist) include Typhoid (Natassia Malthe) a human vector of contagion who brings quite literally the kiss of death. Her set piece is a scene of girl-on-girl action that seems designed to appeal to the Stuff and Maxim magazine demographic. Then theres Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) a dreadlocked rock star dude whose body art has the ability to animate itself leading to some moderately expensive-looking special effects; Stone (Bob Sapp) who appears to be made out of said material; and the unfortunately generic Kinkou (Edson T. Ribeiro) whose deadly super power based on the pronunciation of his name as ""Kinko"" seems to be the ability to collate and staple his enemies. Okay hes not so cool. As for the rest of the movie what it suffers from most is the sense of offhand storytelling that lies halfway between creative laziness and cost-cutting sloppiness. ""You really kill people for a living?"" asks Abby of Elektra at one point. ""Yeah"" our heroine replies. ""Why?"" ""Its what Im good at."" ""That"" says Abby in what amounts to an assessment of the film ""is messed up."" ELEKTRA (PG-13 96 minutes) -- Contains martial arts violence assassination a sexual allusion and some obscenity.

At one point during one of the interminable interludes between the mediocre fight scenes the guy in front of me leaned his head back stared at the ceiling and groaned. And not with pleasure. ""Elektra"" is bad. Its opaque where it should be clear (motivations; fight scenes). Its clear where it should be opaque (what happens next). It substitutes atmosphere for story and wants us to care about unlikable characters. The last time we saw Elektra (Jennifer Garner) -- in Ben Afflecks 2003 movie ""Daredevil"" -- she was dead. At the beginning of this movie though the voice of Elektras sensei (Terrence Stamp) informs us ""Since time began"" a war has been waged against an evil empire The Hand and masters in this war have the power among other things to bring back the dead. Which he has apparently done with his star pupil. So whats Elektra doing now that shes alive again? Oh killing people. Shes such a deadly assassin she has her own agent (Colin Cunningham). Her most recent gig involves traveling to a remote Pacific Northwest-looking island where she awaits orders. Waiting though isnt her strong suit. Shes fidgety and haunted -- not by her own death or the deaths of others shes caused but by her father who once made her tread water for a really long time. Movie review Showtimes and trailer (1/2 star) ""Elektra"" with Jennifer Garner Terrence Stamp Kirsten Prout. Directed by Rob Bowman from a screenplay by Zak Penn Stuart Zicherman and Raven Metzner. 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 for action violence. Several theaters. On the island she runs into a smirky teenage girl (Kirsten Prout) who tries to steal from her and who just happens to have a handsome single father with three-day stubble (Goran Visnjic). Not surprisingly they turn out to be her targets. Not surprisingly she cant go through with it. When Japanese assassins show up to do the deed she switches sides and the three go on the lam. Most of the martial-arts heroes in the movie are white; most of the martial-arts villains are Asian. Which is apparently Hollywoods way of thanking Asia for the whole martial-arts phenomenon. Is there anything of value here? Not much. ""You talk in riddles old man"" she tells her sensei. ""It ends now"" the main villain barks at her. If only I thought.

Starring Jennifer Garner Terence Stamp Goran Visnjic and Kirsten Prout. Directed by Rob Bowman. (PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Elektra"" is slow and without pleasure and it turns the vivid face of Jennifer Garner into the smooth immobile face of a video game character. Her face is so smooth and immobile in fact that it takes about a half hour to figure out that shes neither wearing some plastic glaze over her face nor is she the victim of some botched plastic surgery. It turns out that its just the movie -- another inert soul-dead action drama that turns actors into zombies. Yet as awful as it is ""Elektra"" is even more dispiriting. It seems to have been made by people operating from a fundamental misconception about what it is to be human and what it means to make movies. Its based on a Marvel Comics series but comic book characters are much more lively in the imagination than the ones director Rob Bowman (""Reign of Fire"") puts on display here. The movie is an amalgamation of unfortunate scenes an alternating pattern of confused plot detail empty violence and false sentiment. Its garbage. Specifically its Garner going around in a tight red outfit killing people. She is without emotion as close as a human being can get to being a machine. More to the point she is as close as a woman can get to being a man. This is film feminism in the 21st century Take a cruel bloodthirsty homicidal character but instead of making the character a man make it a woman. Then pretend youve created an exemplar of female strength. I liked this fake feminism better when it was called misogyny. So what was Garner thinking when she agreed to do this -- that shed look good in red? That this would be a great excuse to get into shape? Heres a question actors should really ask themselves when they make such films ""Would I watch it if I werent in it?"" If Garner would watch this mess fine but if she wouldnt whats the point of making it? The best thing that could happen is that the picture spawns a franchise and Garner becomes known as that girl in the ""Elektra"" movies. Then well all look back and talk about how ""13 Going on 30"" represented the summit of her art. But were getting ahead of ourselves. Lets talk about the first scene in which Elektra shows up and throws a sword through a guy as he sits on an upholstered chair drinking what looks like scotch. He drops the glass. This is whats curious about the scene 1. We dont know what he did to deserve this. 2. We dont know who she is. 3. He doesnt have a weapon but she does. 4. Were supposed to root for her. Were supposed to think shes really cool. If you dont know why thats twisted I cant explain it to you. After that job she needs a vacation. But an Asian crime organization called the Hand hires her to kill two people in some cozy vacation setting. Shes ready to do it until she finds out that the Hand wants her to kill this nice father and daughter with whom she has struck up an acquaintance. When she finds she cant go through with it she cancels the job and makes it her mission to protect her two new friends. In the movies scheme of things Elektras move from complete moral vacancy to the nascent ethics of a paramecium is supposed to be heralded as an epic transformation. Elektra likes the daughter (Kirsten Prout) because she reminds her of herself and she likes the father (Goran Visnjic) at least enough to kiss him twice. An hour into the movie Garner almost smiles. Otherwise shes all business having to protect her new friends from the evil Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) a young martial arts master whose combat gimmick is to throw bedsheets around. Im serious. In truth ""Elektra"" gives Garner nothing to play. Its a character that makes no internal sense and is of no external interest. At one point Elektra is asked why she kills people for a living and the writers give Garner nothing real to answer just another evasion ""Its what Im good at it."" Actually Jennifer youre not. -- Advisory Scenes of murder and mayhem.

"Blood-letting Becomes Elektra - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Elektra Blood-letting Becomes ElektraMovies - REVIEW - `ElektraA Homicidal Heroine With Issues Meets A Bland Villain In A Film Littered With Rip-offs.January 14 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticJennifer Garner -- she of the killer bangs killer bod and killing blades -- racks up quite a body count in Elektra.This Daredevil sequel is a dark flashy and empty 90 minutes that benefits greatly from the post-Spider-Man sheen that Sam Raimi put on comic book films. Its shot cut and designed to death.But they spent their money on the look not the script or cast. Rule number one for this brand of brain candy Buy a decent villain. Every Batman needs a Joker. Theyve got nobody no Joker no Colin Farrell (Daredevils baddie). Their nobody is played by Will Yun Lee.The films multi-writer screenplay struggles vainly to hide its plagiarized themes and action beats.And Elektra is the bloodiest PG-13 in memory. She snaps necks the way Hollywood snaps up Marvel Comics.Garner of TVs Alias plays the latest Marvel action figure in need of a shrink. Shes an assassin for hire a remorseless killer who cant figure out why her job is giving her nightmarish flashbacks to the murder of her parents.Think about it dear. What Greek tragedy about a mourning vengeful daughter were you named for?She wipes out one generic bad guy protected by generic henchmen in an opening that is all Jen in that hot-babe Elektra bustier meting out a flurry of knives darts bullets and arrows. The generic villain sits before a generic fireplace telling his hireling that hes doomed that he knows this ""legend"" is coming to kill him.""They say Elektra whispers in your ear before she kills you.""We spend the rest of the movie with its attendant stabbings and neck-snappings waiting for that whisper. And the satin red bustier to come out again. Because those signal the final fight right?Her blind beau in Daredevil has been replaced by a blind mentor-guru whimsically played by a wizened Terence Stamp who has turned up in more of these films (Superman Star Wars Episode One) than an actor with his chops should have. He narrates the tale.""Since time began a war has been waged between the forces of good and evil"" he intones sending a chill down fanboy spines and a shudder up everybody elses.This Japanese gang The Hand is looking for ""The Treasure."" They have to kill Elektra before getting their hands on it.Meanwhile ""E"" as her friends call her is getting mixed up with a father-daughter duo who are in the Superhero Protection Program (Goran Visnjic and Kirsten Prout). Elektra ignores her ""dont get involved"" credo her avoidance of human contact of any sort because the girl reminds her of herself at that age and Dad reminds her she hasnt dated in a long time.Comic book adaptations have morphed into martial arts films -- steeped in legend or imitation legend stylized in action. Theres always some blind whiz who dishes out the pain just as in the Japanese Blind Swordsman movies or the Chinese House of Flying Daggers. The fights are set pieces swiped from some earlier martial arts classic. Assassins crawling down trees? Even House of Flying Daggers repeats that.Rob Bowman who cut his teeth on The X-Files and whose big-screen credits include the wacky Reign of Fire turns the wind machines on Garner at every opportunity. Her hair and capes billow around her perfectly-pursed and glossed lips. He gives the fights a whiplash immediacy even if the effects are Matrix knockoffs.Garner is an intriguing if unsatisfying presence at the heart of this. She has mastered playing that tough but emotionally immature waif and makes Elektra a riff on her Alias character a killer with ""issues.""But obsessive-compulsive disorder -- she counts her footsteps and cleans and organizes everywhere she goes -- seems like the least of them.

Running time 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence). At the Empire the Chelsea West the UA East others. THE best thing you can say about ""Elektra"" a lifeless spinoff of the failed Marvel Comics ""Daredevil"" movie franchise starring Jennifer Garner is that Ben Affleck is mercifully absent this time around. Garners character was killed near the end of ""Daredevil"" but shes brought back to life by her blind martial arts trainer the fortune-cookie-aphorism-dispensing Stick (Terence Stamp) who works no such miracles on this dead-on-arrival movie. Instead another character named Typhoid (Natassia Malthe) who literally sucks the life out of people seems to have also worked her powers on Garner who this time around is entirely lacking the charm and charisma she demonstrated in ""Daredevil"" much less ""13 Going on 30"" and ""Alias."" Now a glowering moody contract killer with heightened senses and a skimpy red suit Elektra has been dispatched to a remote island in the Pacific Northwest by parties unknown to execute what she euphemizes as ""payroll reduction"" on Mark (Goran Visnjic of ""ER"") and his 13-year-old daughter Abby (the charmless Kirsten Prout). But after Abby invites her to a Christmas Eve dinner that turns into an ambush by an army of ninja warriors Elektra changes her mind and decides to rescue Mark and Abby from The Hand - an international crime syndicate that a laborious series of flashbacks indicate was also responsible for the deaths of Elektras parents. The harebrained plot by Zak Penn (""X2"") and a couple of other hacks - bumblingly directed by ""X Files"" veteran Rob Bowman - resembles nothing so much as a dumbed-down PG-13 version of ""Kill Bill"" put together by a team tone-deaf to bad dialogue atrocious acting cheesy special effects and clumsily staged action sequences. That ""Elektra"" was produced on less than half the budget of ""Daredevil"" is painfully obvious from the long stretches without any action whatsoever and lots of incoherent babbling about The Hands search for The Treasure. When Elektra finally does take on The Hand with the help of The Treasure (dont ask) its an anticlimactic series of boring ""Matrix""-inspired special-effects-loaded faceoffs with ringleader Kirigi (Will Yun Lee); Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) whose body art comes to life to attack enemies; and Stone (Bob Sapp) a seemingly invulnerable large black man. ""Elektra like the tragedy"" remarks Mark who becomes involved in an unconvincing romance with the icy Elektra even as she becomes unconvincingly maternal with his daughter. ""Your parents must have had a sense of humor."" No one can make the same accusation of the deadly dull ""Elektra.""

With Jennifer Garner Terence Stamp Goran Visnjic Kirsten Prout. Director Ron Bowman (140). PG-13 Action violence. 2 Stars. Elektra died in 2003s ""Daredevil."" No big whoop. The sinewy assertive bombshell has been revived for ""Elektra"" an adequate but none-too-thrilling star vehicle for Jennifer Garner in flame-colored bustier and low-riding pants. In Frank Millers comics for Marvel Elektra was one tough babe - ""mercenary bounty hunter assassin mistress of the deadly art of ninjutsu ... and no mans fool."" Continued from cover And Garner is up to the job bolstered by better material than Halle Berry had with ""Catwoman"" or Angelina Jolie with ""Lara Croft"" although its hard to say which of them wore tighter outfits. But the movie bows to convention perhaps fearing that audiences wont accept a woman with hide this thick. Elektra is stripped of the unrepentant ferocity that made her a crossover hit in the first place. Here she quickly succumbs to her gooey maternal side - which means if ever theres a sequel shell have no edge. At least shes on her feet again revived by her former sensei (Terence Stamp) and none the worse for death. The details of her character that we may remember from ""Daredevil"" barely register (even though Garner is currently dating ""Daredevil"" co-star Ben Affleck). Also gone is some of her backstory including the implied Electra complex of her name. In place of excessive love for Daddy this character is tormented by childhood memories of her mothers murder. So she takes a vacation from her day job in the middle of what looks to be her busy season. It must be hard for a woman with no conscience to relax but she gives it a whirl in a Vancouver beachhouse. Perhaps shes a little too relaxed because when the next assignment comes in shes unable to pull the trigger. Thus begins a long bloody road to self-knowledge replete with martial-arts frenzy. She takes under her well-muscled wing a single dad (Goran Visnjic) and his full-of-surprises daughter (Kirsten Prout) shielding them from The Hand a consortium of corporate goons with oddball specialties. One of the baddies sports animal tattoos that burst from his chest and run amok. Another is a woman who kisses people to death. Funny how all those speedy jump cuts stop dead when its time for Elektra to get a passionate same-sex kiss. Garner the equally sinewy and assertive star of ABCs ""Alias"" is nimble and steely-eyed although she was far more enjoyable in the light comedy ""13 Going on 30."" When her Elektra is moody and unable to connect with people shes tantalizing at least psychologically. Once she starts breaking attackers in half its a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.

In her latest film Elektra a spinoff of last years Marvel comic-book movie Daredevil she seems wooden and dour as if she is made cranky by her unearthly physical power. Her grace and mystical abilities make for a lonely burden and we are supposed to feel her pain. Instead we feel our own for having to sit through this silly movie. (Related video Watch the Elektra trailer) Garner is best suited for dainty roles like the one she played in 13 Going on 30. Twentieth Century Fox On the couple of occasions that Garner does lighten up one is reminded of how much more engaging she is in a romantic comedy. Its great to have a female action star who can go toe-to-toe with the toughest guys but the price paid is a lack of depth and humanity. Granted Elektra is targeted to the youthful and largely male fans of the comic-book-movie genre but surely a more substantive story wouldnt have put off die-hard fans. Look at both Spider-Man movies They had substance as well as style and dazzling action. This story tries to inject a human element by giving us Elektras tragic back story (in a tiresome set of flashbacks) and a semi-romance (including adolescent dialogue) with the also-mysterious Mark Miller (Goran Visjnic). Left scarred as a girl by the death of her mother Elektra bonds with Abby Marks strong-willed daughter (Kirsten Prout). About the movie Elektra   (out of four) Stars Jennifer Garner Terence Stamp Goran Visnjic Kirsten Prout Directors Rob Bowman Distributor Twentieth Century Fox Rated PG-13 for action violence Opens Friday nationwide Complicating things is a syndicate of menacing warriors collectively called ""The Hand"" and individually possessing such catchy names as Stone Typhoid and Tattoo. These martial-arts killers are hell-bent on capturing Abby and taking Elektra down. Tattoos illustrations come to life and attack or provide tactical locations depending on the species. Tattooed eagles serve as some sort of aerial GPS locator device and painted snakes slither off the warriors toned abs and attack Abby. Its not clear why but hey its a comic-book movie. Elektra has her own ace in the hole which mystifyingly she doesnt use until pressed. Shes schooled in mystical arts that allow her to see into the future and sometimes change it. Elektra was the prize pupil of the inexplicably named Stick a blind master (Terence Stamp who gives the movie some class). Initially Elektra dutifully takes murder assignments from her ""agent."" Obedient killing machine that she is she dons her red leather bustier and low-riding crimson killer pants grabs her knives and asks no questions. But she grows soft upon meeting Mark and Abby. When she protects Abby from the murderous Hand the young girl gushes ""You gave me my life back."" Elektra responds ""And you gave me mine back."" One wonders who will give us our two hours back?

"Who said supergirls just wanna have fun? - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW Who said supergirls just wanna have fun?January 14 2005|Carina Chocano | Times Staff Writer Director Rob Bowmans Elektra doesnt have a complex. She has disorders. Shes an obsessive-compulsive workaholic celibate with daddy issues. (Not to be confused with a daddy ""fixation"" which might inspire more freewheeling behavior). Shes a Tri-Delt in other words. If she werent a ninja assassin shed work in publishing and cry after sex.What is it about comic book supergirls and big-budget action heroines that compels screenwriters and directors to condemn them to lives of neurotic monasticism? Would it kill a tough girl to crack a smile or eat a Twinkie or make a pass once in a while? Does she have to be a squinty jerk with intimacy issues in order to be considered super? These and other questions are raised but never answered by ""Elektra"" who for an ultraviolent ""nimbo"" (thats ninja bimbo for the uninitiated) who does her salaried killing in a red satin teddy and stiletto heels is no fun at all.Originally created by legendary Marvel Comics writer Frank Miller in 1980 the comic book Elektra (a distant but simpatico relation to the Hellenic myth presumably) is the daughter of a Greek ambassador and his unfaithful wife Christina. She grows up to become Daredevils lover dies and is brought back to life in her own lurid limited series.In the comic terrorists murder her beloved father and only remaining parent and Elektra turns to a life of salaried crime. Far be it from Fox though to promote such cynicism and sluttishness in what it hopes will be a major new franchise starring a squeaky-clean Jennifer Garner. Perhaps in an effort to clean up the role (shes a killer OK but other than that shes a nun) Bowman and screenwriters Zak Penn and Stuart Zicherman amp; Raven Metzner have decided to rehabilitate Elektras moms checkered reputation Instead of being shot in half while dozing placid and pregnant on a Greek beach shes killed during her noonday nap in a Greek-themed American mansion. The deed is done by a beastly representative of the Hand an evil ninja syndicate and young Elektra discovers the body and is forever haunted by the image of her saintly martyred mom. Turning the rage inward in the manner of anorexics worldwide she gives herself over to exercise OCD and loneliness.Why Fox has taken a character named Elektra and given her a mommy fixation is anybodys guess. As for daddy hes not the lovable parent of the book but a tyrannical sports-dad who repeatedly appears onscreen in flashback just to scream at her from the side of the pool. Presumably hes still among the living though obviously estranged.Millers Elektra lived in a world of greed and near-total corruption. But Bowmans Elektra inhabits the same old dualistic Bushworld we keep hearing about in White House news conferences ""Since time began"" a voice informs us at the start of the movie ""a war has been waged in the shadows between the forces of good and evil."" But only good has decent representation. Yes Elektra has an agent -- the weaselly McCabe (Colin Cunningham) who says things like ""Youre crashing on me baby. I said you were crashing on me and youre crashing on me."" This sort of thing makes him either one of the best or the worst things about ""Elektra"" -- which patently refuses to give itself over to gaudy melodrama but occasionally settles on low-key camp.Bowman lets his ghostly ninja keep the get-up depicted in the book (and omitted in ""Daredevil"") but he bleeds as much of the Miller darkness from the story as he can. The movie is not so much tenebrous as it is adolescently surly. Despite an introductory sequence in which Elektra dispatches a man patiently awaiting death in front of a roaring fire she spends much of the movies first half brooding counting and arranging things just so. (You half expect her to jog to Joni Mitchell eat an apple and throw it up.) Her performance is so clenched steely and bloodless I found myself agreeing with her agents rather crassly suggested method of relaxation.She never takes his advice of course though she does thaw to room temperature upon meeting Mark (Goran Visnjic) and Abby Miller (Kirsten Prout) a father and daughter living on a remote island. All it takes is one not-so-friendly dinner with the gifted teenager and her handsome dad (who spends most of the movie kicking dirt on the sidelines) for Elektras maternal instincts to come alive. This bovine vision of female comic book heroism is especially dispiriting considering Garners prior experience in the genre. As Sydney on ABCs spy series ""Alias"" Garner fights badness wears good outfits and enjoys a personality and a love life all at the same time.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESElektra avenger of Catwoman?January 9 2005Story About Latino Comic Books PraisedJanuary 31 2000The Great Book DebateJune 30 1985Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/14/entertainment/et-elektra14,200,elektra21,elektra,latimes

Her Elektra was introduced in 2003s Daredevil in which she sparred and flirted with Ben Afflecks blind superhero. In this Rob (The X-Files) Bowman-directed solo outing Garners character is a high-priced hit woman who slinks around in midriff- and cleavage-revealing getups wielding fancy daggers and striking dramatic poses frequently in the face of off-camera wind machines.As Elektra begins the moody murderess has dispatched a legion of bodyguards to reach her latest target a guy seemingly resigned to his imminent death - and doing a bad James Caan impersonation while hes at it. Elektras business agent (Colin Cunningham) calls her soon afterwards with a new job but shes not sure she wants it Haunted by flashbacks of her childhood (her loving mother was murdered her overbearing father wouldnt let her out of the swimming pool) she senses she needs some time off.When Elektra is told that the assignment will fetch her 2 million she senses that she can postpone her vacation. Waiting for the details - i.e. the identities - of her victims-to-be Elektra spends a couple of days in a dramatic lakeside apartment laying out her toiletries in a manner that reveals serious OCD issues - and also reveals product plugs for Rite Aid pharmacies and CloseUp toothpaste. (So thats Garners secret)Then she meets a precocious 13-year-old girl (Kirsten Prout) and the teens ruggedly handsome widower dad (Goran Visnjic). At first frosty and put-offish Elektra soon warms to the father-daughter duo until she learns that her victims-to-be are well guess who.Mightily conflicted Elektras exacting professionalism and dormant sense of humanity are suddenly at odds (shes sort of hot for the chiseled smiling dad too). Enter The Hand a team of freakishly endowed ninja henchmen working for an evil Asian (Will Yun Lee) who operates from a sleek conference room in a sleek office tower in an unnamed city that looks suspiciously like Vancouver. (Elektra was shot in Canada allowing the production to stretch its budget - and allowing a few oddly accented phrases into the dialogue.)Much martial arts hoo-ha ensues with slo-mo somersaults and body-spins rounds of bullet fire and nunchaku-projectiling and more flashbacks to Elektras days training under the sage ninjitsu master Stick - a blind man who speaks in epigrammatic ways and has the white hair and stony features of the British actor Terence Stamp.Apart from a complete lack of believable characters and a relentlessly solemn tone Elektra is mildly diverting the scenery is beautiful the leading actress is taut and buff. And hey compared to last summers Catwoman its a masterpiece.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Read his recent work at http//go.philly.com/stevenrea.Elektra  (out of four stars)Produced by Arnon Milchan Gary Foster and Avi Arad directed by Rob Bowman written by Zak Penn Stuart Zicherman and Raven Metzner photography by Bill Roe music by Christophe Beck distributed by Twentieth Century Fox.Running time 1 hour 45 mins.Elektra. . .

"Elektra | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; elektra ) Elektra (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli I have never understood the appeal of Jennifer Garner as an action/adventure star. Based on my limited exposure to her work shes better in comedic or lightly dramatic roles (such as her turn in 13 Going on 30). Nothing that happens in Elektra has changed my mind. Although Garner was arguably the best thing about the lukewarm comic book adaptation of Daredevil her character had limited screen-time playing fourth fiddle to Ben Affleck Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell. The translation from supporting character to lead doesnt go smoothly. Garner has difficulty carrying this movie although the weakness of the script could be part of the reason. Instead of following the usual superhero path of the protagonist trying to stop a diabolical villain from taking over the world (or some similarly grandiose goal) Elektra goes all metaphysical on us. It seems that we have reached a key point in the endless battle between good and evil. A Chosen One has been born and both sides want her. Evil is represented by ""The Hand"" - a bunch of Japanese bad guys who have cool powers and disappear in a puff of green smoke when they are killed. Good is represented by the films resident Yoda/Mr. Miyazaki Stick (Terence Stamp who played the super-villain Zod in Superman II) and his reluctant pupil Elektra (Garner). She isnt done with her training yet so shes not a real Jedi and the dark side of the Force beckonsa| Oops sorry wrong movie. ""But wait"" you say ""Elektra died in Daredevil."" That is a correct observation but in films like this death is only a temporary inconvenience. Characters return from beyond the grave as often in comic books as they do in soap operas. It turns out that Stick can manipulate time and revive the dead. Elektra starts out her second life as his apprentice but is eventually kicked out of paradise. Instead of seeking out Ben Affleck (at least on screen) she becomes a paid assassin (imitating what he did in Gigli). Its after she turns down a job to kill Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his teenage daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout) that she runs afoul of The Hand. They have decided that if Chosen One Abby wont join them theyll eliminate her from the equation. When Elektra becomes Mark and Abbys accidental protector she ends up headed for a confrontation with the evil sorcerer/swordsman Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) and his henchmen Tatoo (Chris Ackerman replacing the late Herve Villechaize) Stone (Bob Sapp) and Typhoid (Natissia Malthe). Theres really only one good action sequence in all of Elektra and thats the climactic battle between the title character and her nemesis. Director Rob Bowman borrows techniques from Hong Kong martial arts duels for this fight but their integration is sloppy. Zhang Yimou (Hero The House of Flying Daggers) might have been able to do something with all of the dancing sheets but Bowmans use of them is merely confusing. This one-on-one struggle has plenty of high-energy moments but the resolution is unsatisfying. When it was over my underwhelmed reaction was ""Is that it?"" Elektra contains plenty of intriguing elements that are left unexplored. Except for an occasional quip we never learn much about her death experience. The character is afflicted with an obsessive/compulsive disorder but this turns out to be a personality quirk that is discarded when it doesnt play a role in the storylines resolution. All of the human relationships (Elektra/Stick Elektra/Abby Elektra/Mark) are underdeveloped. I think theres supposed to be some sort of romantic attraction between Elektra and Mark (after all they kiss twice) but actors Garner and Goran Visnjic (on a break from ""E.R."") never connect. Elektra is one of the least effective comic book-to-movie stories to have come along in the past few years. Without a viable screenplay theres nowhere for the character to go and no way to avoid making her look silly. Garner looks elektra-cute in red but I should not have been thinking about the impracticality of that outfit as assassins garb. Involving movies banish such thoughts; Elektra encourages them. When a comic book movie fails to grab its audience it is apt to come across as excruciatingly dumb. That description applies to offerings like Catwoman The Punisher and Elektra. This movie is better than the other two but thats not company in which any self-respecting superhero would want to be included.

"""Elektra"" with Jennifer Garner back as the fiery martial... - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs ""Elektra"" with Jennifer Garner back as the fiery martial...January 14 2005|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic. and `ELEKTRA (star)""Elektra"" with Jennifer Garner back as the fiery martial arts queen from ""Daredevil"" is a spectacular comic book heroine movie that quickly turns into a spectacular dud.Marvel Studios movie arm of the ubiquitous Marvel franchise may be setting the gold standard for comic book film adaptations with gilt-edged entertainments like last years ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""X2."" But ""Elektra"" first out of their box this year is as bad as they come.Its the would-be super-tale of a morose super-hit-woman (Garners Elektra) who has soured on the world but comes out of her funk when shes hired to assassinate a little girl she meets and likes--and then decides to protect her instead. Suddenly theres meaning in Elektras life a spring in her kick and fire in her eyes and ultra-red outfits.The world becomes fun again for Elektra if not for us as she tries to shield beleaguered Abby and Mark Miller (Kirsten Prout and Goran Visnjic) a little superheroine-to-be and her hunky ""E.R.""-veteran dad from a gang of nasty supervillains The Hand. And as Elektra keeps running from these bad guys or taking them on the movie keeps sinking into howling stereotypes and silliness.""Daredevil"" the 2003 film epic on Marvels man without fear--and the picture that introduced Jennifer Garners kick-butt heroine to the screen--seemed to me the weakest of all Marvel entries to date. But ""Elektra"" makes ""Daredevil"" look good.Misdirected by Rob Bowman (""The X-Files"") miswritten by Zak Penn and the team of Stuart Zicherman and Raven Metzner and mostly over-acted by a cast of game but unfortunate talents headed by the striking Garner (""Alias"") this is a picture that seems to serve no useful purpose other than as a marketing tool for action toys and a classic demonstration of how not to make a movie.Viewed in that light though the frenetic flashy absolutely empty ""Elektra"" is impressive. Its a catastrophe that keeps growing as we watch Elektra scowling at the world and beaming at little Abby surrounded by queer billowing windstorms that wheeze up whenever the indoor action or slaughter commences or stripping down to her red siren outfits when faced with the villains. The Hand is a colorful but singularly unappealing lot effete team-leader Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) ink-covered Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) the behemoth Mr. T and Rock knockoff Stone (Bob Sapp) agile Kinkou (Edson T. Ribeiro) and psycho-femme Typhoid (Natassia Malthe) who tries to soul-kiss Elektra to death.Devotees of awful filmmaking cant go wrong with this one.And students of poor screenwriting will find a trove of feather-witted cliches unimaginative action and graceless rhythmless dialogue--a script running the gamut from pointless brutal fights to charmless jokes (including L.A.-centric gags about Lakers season tickets) to an ending flooded with cheap sentimentality and would-be heart-tugging alohas.Scholars of ineffective camerawork can feast their eyes on the flat metallic lighting and would-be bad editors can learn much from the slightly incoherent slam-bang action scenes and the jarring closeup littered dramatic moments.Fans of pointless special effects wizardry can marvel at such headache-inducing feats as the writhing snakes pouring out of the painted body of villainous Tattoo or the tree that takes forever to crash down on the seemingly rockhard Stone.Finally directors everywhere can take counsel from the fact that though helmer Bowman has made some good TV (""The X-Files"" and its 1998 movie version) he can barely generate any interest entertainment or excitement from this overstrained zap-and-zowie fest.As for the acting--even though one hesitates to blame any cast faced with material like this--only Terence Stamp doing decent work as the blind martial arts master Stick (a kind of Zatoichi/General Zod hybrid) and occasional moments of entertaining obnoxiousness from little Kirsten Prout as Abby raise the curve enough to disqualify this from any possible big studio movie worst-ensemble prizes.What does ""Elektra"" have going for it besides Stamp Garners wardrobe and some increased fealty to the original Elektra? Well if you bent over backwards you might take heart from the fact that in the largely macho adolescent world of comic book action movies this is one with two hard-slugging female heroines battling a lot of wimpy or muscle-bound guys who finally fold like an accordion. But thats the kind of rationale used to justify ""Lara Croft"" or ""Charlies Angels."" Its better to give Marvel a pass this time and wait for ""The Fantastic Four.""`Elektra(star)Directed by Rob Bowman; written by Zak Penn Stuart Zicherman Raven Metzner; photographed by Bill Roe; edited by Kevin Stitt; production designed by Graeme Murray; music by Christophe Beck; produced by Arnon Milchan Gary Foster Avi Arad.

Yet solo adventure ""Elektra"" proves no more than fitfully satisfying a character-driven superhero yarn whose flurry of last-minute rewriting shows in a disjointed plot. Jennifer Garners Elektra was clearly the most memorable thing about ""Daredevil"" so they revived her from apparent death and jettisoned her horned boyfriend. Yet solo adventure ""Elektra"" proves no more than fitfully satisfying a character-driven superhero yarn whose flurry of last-minute rewriting shows in a disjointed plot. Garners ascendant star eye-catching billboards and a relatively modest budget should yield a respectable bounty as the pic fights its way through various forms of exhibition but additional Lazarus-like resurrections appear unlikely. In theory there should be something liberating about adapting more obscure comicbook creations to the bigscreen inasmuch as they arrive burdened with fewer expectations and preconceived notions. After ""Elektra"" and ""The Punisher"" however consideration needs to be given to capturing the dark streaks in these Marvel properties without bleaching out most of the fun. Despite a promising start ultimately this tale of an icy assassin who becomes a young girls protector feels alternately too talky to triumph as an action vehicle and too frenetic to be fleshed out to succeed as a drama. Trained as a ninjalike warrior after her mothers murder (recounted in a series of flashbacks) Elektra is introduced in a smooth sequence showcasing precisely how dangerous she can be as she overcomes multiple guards en route to her quarry. Lightning quick she wields a pair of three-pronged knives called sais perfect for as much shish-kebabbing as a PG-13 rating will allow. (The bad guys conveniently disappear in puffs of smoke once eliminated reducing the post-fight mess.) Soon though she is hired to kill 13-year-old Abby (Kirsten Prout) and her father (Goran Visnjic) targets of the Hand a shadowy organization opposed by Elektras former mentor Stick (Terence Stamp) and his equally chopsocky cohort. Determined to save the girl Elektra faces a formidable team of adversaries under the stewardship of Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) whose now-you-seen-him now-you-dont antics parallel her own. Director Rob Bowman cut his teeth on ""The X-Files"" but the moody atmosphere (aided immeasurably by Christophe Becks percussive score) cant mask the films shortcomings in the later reels. Once the action finally kicks in too much of it lacks the requisite excitement and frankly the most intriguing villains get dispatched too easily. Established as an action heroine in her TV series ""Alias"" Garner could be that rarest of female stars -- comfortably flitting from a charming turn in the romantic comedy ""13 Going on 30"" to bad-ass action roles where she can put those enviably sculpted abs to use. But ""Elektra"" affords her only limited opportunities to flex much more than her pouting muscles combined with an inordinately purposeful strut. Glimpses of wit do emerge from the trio of credited writers such as Elektras deadpan explanation that her work involves ""payroll deductions."" Who knew moreover that assassins employ agents who settle for 10% of the gross? Still the film cant sustain any sense of rhythm in the way say that the ""X-Men"" films managed to do. Thats despite first-rate physical trappings from the lush forest scenery (shot in Vancouver) to Garners form-flattering costumes. Bringing comicbooks to life always represents a particular challenge with words and images that dont quite survive the leap from page to screen. ""Elektra"" earnestly tries to complete that jump but once the fightings over cant quite stick the landing.

He was just a gray-haired guy on the clock and shes a Marvel Comics action heroine played by iron-jawed changeling/Alias star Jennifer Garner. He wore an anonymous navy blue jacket and she crouches and leaps in a cunning red bustier picked from Madonnas castoffs. He lugged only night-vision goggles while she wields fancy three-pronged daggers and steely glances on her rounds as a contract killer -- an assassin who shakes up the natural order of this comic-book universe when she decides to protect the lives of a father (ERs Goran Visnjic) and daughter (Canadian TV actress Kirsten Prout) shes supposed to eliminate. The guard had a strange and interesting job to do; she did not. Once Elektra was Daredevils squeeze (I dare you to remember Daredevil) and then she was dead and then she was returned to life through the mystical ministrations of a blind guru (Terence Stamp). But you know what? Just as all regular models cant be supermodels so all action chicks cant be superheroines. Elektra Natchios turns out to be walled off rather than mysteriously alluring; blank rather than deep. And since no spirit flows through Elektra whos dammed up in a way Garner avoided in 13 Going on 30 it follows that no spirit flows through Elektra either. The psychotherapeutic subplot in which she works out her own childhood trauma through her relationship with the (rather super) girl whose life she saves doesnt make her any happier; the jumpy pace established by Reign of Fire director Rob Bowman doesnt enhance the impersonal special effects. Chased by evil henchmen from the dark-side syndicate known as The Hand Elektra girds her loins with less intensity of purpose than if she were scanning the darkness for signs of copyright infringement.
