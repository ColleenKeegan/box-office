The original Muppet Show first screened in 1976 when its unique combination of sweet surreal and subtly satirical silliness was the perfect panacea for a country (it was shot in Britain lest we forget) sliding hopelessly into financial meltdown. Now here we are 35 years later and The Muppets are back to distract us from another bout of economic misery through the simple application of soulful psychedelic songsmithery and rubber chicken gags (WACKA WACKA).Its all down to the efforts of two men. After the success of Forgetting Sarah Marshall a romcom about a guy who puts on a puppet musical rising comic star Jason Segel and his writing partner (and occasional director) Nicholas Stoller were clearly a strong if not the most commercial choice to reinvigorate this languishing franchise and the way theyve managed to feed Segels lifelong Muppet obsession into the resulting movie is nothing short of brilliant. Segel plays Gary a rosy-cheeked small-town optimist whose younger brother Walter happens to be well a puppet. Now that Gary is all grown up he hopes to marry his childhood sweetheart Mary (Amy Adams) and get out on his own leaving no place for his furry still-single sibling. So the three head for LA to seek out the only folks who know Walters pain his heroes the Muppets. But times have changed. The old Muppet Theater is in ruins sold off to an evil oil magnate (Chris Cooper). Its original residents are scattered Kermit to his Hollywood mansion Piggy to Paris Vogue Animal to anger management therapy... Theres only one thing for it theyve gotta get the old gang back together.What follows may be a predictable sort of putting-on-a-show hi-jinks but in some ways thats the point this is cosy-blanket filmmaking the very definition of that overused term feelgood. Segel is a charming frontman and if Adams is at times overshadowed by her co-star (not to mention a legion of limelight-grabbing fuzzy-felt extras) the relationship between them is beautifully sketched.But the real stars are of course the Muppets themselves Jim Henson may be gone (and Frank Ozs voice talents are conspicuous by their absence) but The Muppets is entirely true to their pioneering spirit replete with beloved supporting characters subversive asides terrible puns and some of the most ludicrous maniacal musical numbers ever committed to film - one throwaway showcase for a flock of singing chickens may well prove to be the funniest scene of 2012. The result is a film bursting at the seams with sheer unadulterated joy watch it and the world seems just that little bit brighter...

All Rights Reserved. It may not entirely work as a movie but The Muppets shines as a piece of touching pop nostalgia. The challenges facing the film (it feels strange to call a Muppets movie a ""franchise reboot"") are clear and many. Its a kids movie for a generation of kids who dont really know much about Jim Hensons beloved creations; The Muppet Show ended in 1981 though the Muppets themselves lived on through movies and TV specials. Meanwhile its most receptive demographic consists of adults who probably want something a bit more knowing than say The Great Muppet Caper. And yet to get too snarky or pop-culturey would betray the sweet ambling Muppet ethos. Its an awkward dilemma but director James Bobins solution appears to be to indulge the awkwardness. Thats clear from the opening frames which feature home movie footage of a young Muppet Walter and his human brother Gary (who will grow up to be played by Jason Segel who co-wrote the script with his Forgetting Sarah Marshall director and fellow Judd Apatow protege Nicholas Stoller). Walter and Gary arent half-brothers nor are they foster brothers; theyre brother brothers but their obvious difference isnt directly acknowledged even though the plot hinges on Walters discovery of and obsession with The Muppet Show. When Walter visits Los Angeles with Gary and Garys fiancee Mary (Amy Adams) only to discover that the decaying Muppet Studios are now in danger of being torn down by a conniving oil tycoon (Chris Cooper) our heroes decide to gather up the original Muppets and put on a show/telethon to save the studio. If it hasnt already done so the plot now begins to write itself. Kermit the Frog is living in a vast empty mansion in Bel Air but he helps track down his old crew -- Fozzie Bear is performing in Reno with a Muppet tribute band called The Moopets Animal is in (where else?) an anger management class Gonzo has become a plumbing supply tycoon and Miss Piggy is now a high-powered fashion editor (naturally her assistant is played by Emily Blunt in a Devil Wears Prada reprise). Meanwhile among the humans Mary is starting to feel a little left out which forces Gary into one of those dime-a-dozen dilemmas over accepting his responsibilities. There are some original touches along the way however The team needs a celebrity guest star for the show -- so they capture Jack Black who hilariously spends most of the movie tied to a chair screaming for his life and/or commenting bitterly on the onscreen action. On paper it shouldnt work. The studio-in-danger-of-being-torn-down plot is beyond tired and the human mechanics between Mary and Gary are so unbaked one wishes they were at least half so. And as if to confirm their inherent triteness all these obstacles are resolved with a minimum of hassle. Tone is everything here and Segel turns out to be curiously perfect for the role of Muppet savior. The actors cinematic persona has always hovered between good-natured earnestness and calculated artificiality (as in I Love You Man where he kept us wondering if he was the heros best friend or just a hustler after an easy mark). His purposefully awkward song and dance numbers his overzealous vivaciousness help give the movie a homespun quality that smooths over -- or rather justifies -- its many rough edges. Plus theres something genuinely inspired about the fact that the movie is just one big excuse to stage one more go-round of The Muppet Show. As the effort comes together as beloved characters and situations fall into familiar grooves the proceedings gain an affectionately incantatory feel. Well see what the kids do but dont be surprised if the grown-ups find themselves inspired to sing along to those old tunes again.

The minute the picture started I heaved a sigh of relief and broke out in a smile. This is a joyful movie the kind the Muppets (and their many fans) deserve. In the tradition of Jim Hensons original Muppet Show this movie is essentially about putting on a show. Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller have concocted a serviceable storyline about a good-hearted fellow (Segel) and his puppet brother Walter who (along with Segels girlfriend Amy Adams) make a pilgrimage to the Muppet Studio in Hollywood only to discover that its deserted and about to be torn down by a greedy developer (Chris Cooper). The only way to save it is to locate Kermit the Frog and persuade him to reassemble the old gang to put on a fund-raising telethon. There is just enough drama and suspense to lay a foundation for the comedy that defines The Muppets. The writers and director James Bobin havent deviated from the troupes original modus operandi. And the humor is never mean-spirited. All of our old favorites are here from Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy to the original grumpy old men Statler and Waldorf along with a number of celebrities in amusing cameos from Selena Gomez to Mickey Rooney (whose son Michael choreographed the picture). Simplicity is the key to the films success perfectly expressed in an opening musical number featuring Segel Walter Adams and scores of people from their home town who sing and dance to Bret McKenzies ""Lifes a Happy Song."" I like all of McKenzies bright new compositions but when Kermit broke into Paul Williams and Kenny Aschers ""The Rainbow Connection"" I had to wipe a tear from my eye. Its a tear of nostalgia for the happiness these characters have brought me for so many years. Its great to have them back in a movie that audiences of all ages can enjoy This Article is related to Reviews and tagged Alan Arkin Amy Adams Film Reviews James Bobin-2 Jason Segel Rashida Jones The Muppets movie review More From IndieWireNocturnal Animals Striking First Images of Amy Adams amp; Jake Gyllenhaal from Tom Fords ThrillerAngie Tribeca Sneak Peek A Kidney Thief Interrupts An ER ReunionRashida Jones Says Angie Tribeca Deserves Something Bigger Than an Emmy in Hilarious FYC VideoHow Rashida Jones Changed Everything to Make Angie Tribeca Perfect (Consider This) Comments Norm May 14 2016 133 am When the Muppets has their own Tv Show they were unstoppable. It was a Perfect vehicle to display their talents. Then after their Tv run the magic tried to transfer to film with some success. I thought a Muppet Christmas was priceless...The rest of the films run hot and cold with little direction or design. The Muppets are at their best when they are being themselves why cant they write some good scripts around that ? I dont think they need the ""Disney"" seal of approval just better scripts...and soon...Pigs in Space anyone...? Reply pat May 14 2016 133 am I love the muppets.

I went to the midnight premier. We dressed up. I was Gonzo. There were a.few others who dressed up. The movie was amazing. I too teared up at the rainbow connection.

If I could afford it I would probably go 20 or 30 times. People cheered and laughed and clapped at all the good jokes and awesome moments. Im a muppet nut and it was just perfect. Perfect.

The first is the annoying pontification from on high the ""dont you remember BEING A KID?"" method. Weve seen this from any number of films in the past few years (Cough Where the Wild Things Are) played out with all the subtlety of a smash and grab robbery. The second type of nostalgia the preferred type is when a film delivers in the same manner you fondly remember but adds a little something new a wrinkle or two allowing you to authentically reconnect with the material. Avenue two is The Muppets a very enjoyable time at the movies. The opening of The Muppets doesnt portend the movie it will eventually become. Its very Jason Segel-heavy and hes joined by his girlfriend Amy Adams plus a friend named Walter who looks a heck of a lot like a muppet his own self. At the outset as an audience you cant help but think ""Who is this Jason Segel and what has he done with my Kermy?"" This is a valid reaction the same involuntary twitch youd get from a flu shot but this technique turns out to be quite clever. Somehow Segel realized that just throwing the Muppets back in our faces without context wouldnt be as effective thus the slow build allows us to appreciate Gonzo Animal Fozzie and company all the more. Plus the film realizes were living in a post-Muppet world and isnt that sad and astonishing? The Muppets certainly think it is though they go about evangelizing in their normal self-deprecating manner. The vehicle constructed for the transference of Muppet-related jokes is as follows Segel and Adams head to Los Angeles for an anniversary. They arent engaged but Adams is hoping this special occasion will do just the trick. Segel (and its at this point I should probably note his name in the film is ""Gary"") brings Walter along because he doesnt want him to feel left out and also because Walter is a huge Muppets fan who really wants to see the famous Hollywood studio. Unfortunately when they finally arrive in Los Angeles they are disheartened to learn the Muppet facilities are a shell of their former grandeur and further disillusioned to find that a tycoon (Chris Cooper) has his sights set on the very land that used to host The Muppet Show. As per normal hes in it for the oil. Gary and Walter must step up But can they get the Muppets back together in time? Theres your story with a side of PG dramatic tension thrown in for good measure. Kermit is the first Muppet to meet Gary Mary (Amy Adams) and Walter and hes cajoled into getting the gang back together. Its at this juncture that the film begins to gain speed as in-jokes and the repeated breaking of the fourth wall lead to maximum hilarity. Make no mistake these are your fathers Muppets but they are keenly aware that the world has largely passed them by. Cameos from throughout the celeb-o-sphere continually pop up and the uniquely counter-culture Muppet humor shines right on through. The brand of comedy The Muppets offers isnt built from the newly minted awkward realism of Ricky Gervais or of the old-school anger and fury of the late great Bill Hicks. Its something kinder gentler and more broad -- willfully detached from ego but still earnestly comical. The whole enterprise plays as an extended and souped-up Muppet Show episode though its impossible to tell if this will capture younger audiences imagination. Most of the laughs from the film seem to come from a place where you know and are invested in the characters. It would be a sad commentary if the film that sardonically giggled ""time has passed the Muppets by"" turned out to be a facilitator of just that phenomenon. But thats a conversation for a different time and place; for now you can rest easy -- if you have previously loved the Muppets you will likely currently love The Muppets. Its been over a decade but its remained the same we are all Kermit we are all Miss Piggy standing on stage in front of a giant spotlight hoping and praying well find love and adoration one last time.

As Paul Simons frisky whistling solo loops and bounces across the opening montage we watch two brothers Gary and Walter grow up together. Alas only the former does any actual growing Though Gary (played as an adult by Jason Segel) seems a typical enough kid Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) is--theres no delicate way to put this--a felt puppet. So even as Garys annual-height pencil marks keep climbing up the wall Walters remain stubbornly horizontal 5 years old 6 years old 7 8 9 10 11. Before you know it the two brothers are young men out on their own though still enjoying a Bert-and-Ernie bachelordom in adjacent beds. It took perhaps ten minutes for The Muppets to win me over a second time with a giddy infectious bit of song-and-dance fluff titled ""Lifes a Happy Song"" (written like most of the original numbers by Bret McKenzie of ""Flight of the Conchords""). Truth be told The Muppets won me over over and over and over again. The film is an utter delight a tidal surge of joyful nostalgia cunningly repackaged and updated. Take your kids take your parents take a friend or someone youd like to become one. But by all means take yourself. Its hard to miss that a primary thread is essentially the story of an uncloseting Directed by James Bobin (co-creator of ""Conchords"") from a script by Segel and Nicholas Stoller the film follows Walter Gary and Garys best gal Mary (Amy Adams) as they hop on a bus from Smalltown Kansas to Los Angeles. For Mary the trip offers a romantic 10th anniversary getaway with Gary; for Walter an opportunity to visit the fabled Muppet Studios; and for Gary--well lets just say hes conflicted. As it happens Muppet Studios turns out to be less fabled than crumbled. Worse Walter overhears the plottings of an evil tycoon (played with diabolical glee by Chris Cooper) who intends to tear the place down unless the Muppets who have long since gone their separate ways can come up with 10 million to buy it back. So Walter Gary and Mary set out in search of Kermit the Frog and once they find him in search of everyone else Fozzie and Miss Piggy Animal the drummer and Rowlf the Dog and Gonzo the Great Scooter and Beaker and all the rest. Cue up reels of Getting the Band Back Together of Putting on One Last Show and of Learning Valuable Lessons About Love and Self-Worth. In other hands this arc might have proven just as saggy as it sounds. But Bobin Segal and Stoller propel the proceedings with wit and verve genre winks tumbling out over timely demolitions of the fourth wall. That said this is no Shrekish exercise in exhausting inside-jokery The Muppets is equal parts tender and hilarious heartfelt and sly. Its hard to miss that a primary thread is essentially the story of Walters uncloseting his discovery as a puppet/boy of ""The Muppet Show"" and the way it made him feel less different and alone; his gradual grownup realization that he too is one of them. The filmmakers wisely decline to make the analogy explicit instead allowing it to serve as a quiet emotional tether. And even here theyre alert to comic opportunity offering up a self-mocking yet oddly touching duet ""Man or Muppet"" in which Walter and Gary embrace their respective life paths. Quibbles can of course be found. The Muppet voices are inevitably a tad off and 10 or 15 minutes might have been shaved from the back half of the movie. Neither irony nor nostalgia can quite save a montage set to Jefferson Starships ""We Built This City."" And cruelest of all is the meager cameo afforded Neil Patrick Harris which only engenders visions of What Might Have Been. (Maybe in Muppets 2?) But for every misstep there are a dozen times the movie hits its marks exactly the generationally acute jokes about Molly Ringwald ""Benson"" and the banshee screech of early modems; a glimpse of Kermit and Piggy walking the cobbled streets of Montmartre him black-turtlenecked like an amphibian Belmondo; wistful reminders of Muppet Show hosts Steve Martin Julie Andrews Bob Hope and Dom DeLuise; a poultry-clucked pun on Cee-Los ""F You""; Chris Coopers impromptu descent into hip-hop bravado; two variations on ""The Rainbow Connection"" first commercially defiled then lovingly reclaimed; Walters exquisitely Muppet-y curtain-closer; likable turns by Rashida Jones and Zach Galifianakis and Jack Black as himself. As you may have surmised I could go on. But those unconvinced will likely remain so and perhaps for the better. Not all of us have that primordial all-but-forgotten Muppet gene twisted into our DNA. But if you do or even imagine you might plan your holidays accordingly. The Muppets is not the kind of movie likely to get much awards-season consideration though its the kind that ought to smart warm and in its avowedly goofy way elegant. The chorus of one of the songs declares ""Ive got everything that I need right in front of me."" For 120 minutes thats precisely how I felt.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

The Muppets review New fun with the old gang 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Muppets Puppet comedy. Directed by James Bobin. Starring Amy Adams Jason Segel Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. (PG. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Muppets"" is a triumph of simplicity innocence and goofy jokes. Its a triumph of felt. Its a triumph of childhood and childishness of pratfalls and belly laughs of the plain stupid joy in watching Jack Black get bound and kidnapped by puppets. To call it a great film would be missing the point because the Muppets never aspired to greatness. The only -nesses they ever aspired to were niceness funniness and old-fangled vaudeville corniness designed to make us smile. And so they have. Directed by British filmmaker James Bobin (""Da Ali G Show"") from a screenplay by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller ""The Muppets"" is the first theatrical release in a dozen years starring Jim Hensons classic troupe. ""I guess people sort of forgot about us"" sniffs Kermit at one point. Not for long frog. The plot is nothing new aping those ""hey-kids-lets-put-on-a-show"" films from the 1930s and 40s. Basically a Big Bad Texas Oilman played by Chris Cooper plans to drill beneath the storied Muppet Theater and their only hope is reuniting the fuzzy old crew for a one-night variety-show fundraiser.

Animal is stuck in an anger-management class and Miss Piggy is off in Paris running French Vogue through the bangs of an Anna Wintour wig. Helping Kermit reconvene the group are three new characters Walter an idealistic mustard-colored Muppet hopeful; Gary (Segel) Walters grinning human brother; and Mary (Amy Adams) Garys sweet but exasperated girlfriend. And there are songs to be sung - about rainbows natch plus a handful of new tunes celebrating happiness and togetherness and perkiness and yet more -nesses. Gary and Walter belt out a killer power duet on a soul-searching theme (""Am I a man ... or am I a Muppet?"") and Coopers oilman gets to rap a few evil verses on the futility of dreams. But what does he know? ""As long as there are Muppets"" says Walter ""for me theres still hope."" I couldnt agree more. E-mail Amy Biancolli at datebookletterssfchronicle.com.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.""The Muppets"" is a bright colorful perfectly innocuous amusement but its also pretty slapdash and disappointingly sluggish.Story highlights""The Muppets"" isnt the best or the worst of Kermits big-screen capersJason Segel hasnt given himself enough to do as GaryMiss Piggy in particular is a pale shadow of the psychotic diva she used to beRemember the Muppets? Silly question -- youre old enough to read so they probably helped teach you. Back when I was kid they were huge. ""The Muppet Show"" ran five seasons 1976-1981 and spawned half a dozen film spin-offs.The first Muppet movie (""More entertaining than humanly possible"") boasted cameos by Bob Hope Mel Brooks Edgar Bergen Milton Berle Steve Martin and Richard Pryor -- not to mention Orson Welles -- a bill that positioned Kermit and company as the natural heirs to a half-century or more of prime-time vaudeville shtick.But the brand has fallen into neglect and its entirely possible that an otherwise pop savvy 10-year-old wouldnt know his Scooter from his Waldorf. (""Fred the frog?"" my son guessed when I asked him to name one. ""And isnt there a pig?"")Catch up with Kermit and Miss PiggyEnter Jason Segel who fessed up to a fetish for singing puppets in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and who has taken up the challenge of making Jim Hensons fabric-and-thread creations relevant to todays digital generation.Segel who stars and co-wrote (with ""Sarah Marshall"" director Nicholas Stoller) grabs the bull by the horns so to speak by acknowledging that the Muppets glory days are long gone. That strategy risks making this comeback vehicle too much of a nostalgia trip to entice the kiddies but their parents will probably lap it up. Gary and Walter are brothers and inseparable; except that Gary (Segel) is flesh and blood and Walter ... well lets just say theres a reason why Walters favorite show is ""The Muppets.""When Gary invites his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) for a romantic getaway to Los Angeles its only natural that he would invite Walter along too For as long as they both can remember its been Walters dream to visit the Muppet Studios. But when they get there the building is dilapidated and on the verge of falling into the hands of an unscrupulous oilman Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). The only way to save it is to persuade Kermit to round up the old gang and put on a telethon a comeback comedy special.Its not exactly a fresh idea but Segel and debut director James Bobin (""Flight of the Conchords"") amuse themselves -- and us -- by poking fun at the cornball conventions of movie musicals When Mary breaks into a melancholy ballad the sudden downpour on her window pane doesnt come from the heavens but a gardeners hose. A song-and-dance routine involving the entire population of ""Smalltown"" climaxes in the citizens collapsing into a heap exhausted.In fact this early showstopper -- ""Lifes a Happy Song"" -- is easily the pick of the new tunes an infectiously jaunty number written by ""Flight of the Conchords "" Bret McKenzie. Too many of the rest are strictly novelty items including an intentionally awful barbershop rendition of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and Chris Cooper rapping badly.""Man or Muppet"" which is supposed to reflect the identity crisis of the two brothers doesnt make much sense in the circumstances. We can see pretty clearly which is which and where the 2-foot hand puppet really belongs. I hate to be a party pooper. At its best this is a bright colorful perfectly innocuous amusement but its also pretty slapdash and disappointingly sluggish. Tim Burton and Paul Reubens worked this line of parodic faux innocence better in ""Pee-wees Big Adventure"" 25 years ago (so did Amy Adams in ""Enchanted"").Segel hasnt given himself enough to do as Gary whose defining characteristic is neglecting Mary -- and if youre going to go to the trouble of inventing a new Muppet (Walter) why make him a bland nonentity? As for the shows true stars Kermit and Miss Piggy its nice to have them back but I have to say theyve never had the same spark since original voice artists Jim Henson and Frank Oz passed the baton to Steve Whitmire and Eric Jacobson. Piggy in particular is a pale shadow of the psychotic diva she used to be -- just dont tell that to Jack Black the guest star she kidnaps and uh hogties when no other celebrity volunteers for the telethon.A mixed bag then ""The Muppets"" isnt the best or the worst of Kermits big-screen capers. At least its a reminder that heres one frog who isnt about to croak.

The plot involves uncovering an oilmans evil plan to raze the Muppet Theater and drill for the oil recently discovered there. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The Muppets reunite to save their once-glorious theater from an evil oil baron. BOTTOM LINE A pleasant trip down memory lane though never as fresh or as snappy as the original films. CAST Jason Segel Amy Adams Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy WHEN/WHERE Area theaters LENGTH 138 As Cream or The Police or The Human League could tell you reunion tours are all about managing expectations. Fair warning then for ""The Muppets."" The old gang last seen on-screen in 1999 provide plenty of nostalgia but cant quite match the memories fans have in their heads. The movie comes from a very big fan Jason Segel who produced co-wrote and serves as its star. Segel plays Gary whose brother Walter happens to be a Muppet (hes a new creation voiced by Peter Linz). During their vacation to Los Angeles (with Garys long-suffering girlfriend Mary played by Amy Adams) Walter visits the Muppets now-shuttered theater. As the worlds biggest fan hes horrified to discover that its marked for destruction by drill-happy oil baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper hamming it up). advertisement | advertise on newsday As Walter tries to convince the Muppets to reunite and save the theater he realizes his heroes are not what they once were. Kermit lives in a dusty mansion like a silent film star Miss Piggy is a plus-size editor at Paris Vogue and Fozzie Bear fronts a sad tribute band called The Moopets. The scenarios can be funny if at times a little too convincing. Though Piggy and Kermit are no longer voiced by Frank Oz and the late Jim Henson their complicated romance endures and their affectionate stroll through Paris is charming and wryly funny. But the movie also misses many of its marks. The cameos are a random grab bag of folks (James Carville Selena Gomez) who simply show their faces and then vanish. And director James Bobin makes the musical numbers feel campy and ironic -- something the Muppets never were. That said its nice to see the band back together. And when Kermit busts out the banjo for ""Rainbow Connection"" you might even go for your lighter.

"""The Muppets"" Jason Segel loves felt and it shows. Slate Sign In Sign Up Frog March Your Kids to the New Muppets Movie Frog March Your Kids to the New Muppets Movie Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 22 2011 630 PM Welcome Back Kermit Frog march your family to the new Muppets movie this holiday weekend. By Dana Stevens The Muppets are back on the silver screen Scott Garfield (c) Disney. Click on the audio player below to listen to Slates Spoiler Special podcast on The Muppets after youve seen the movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. There are two ways a review of The Muppets (Disney) could go. A skeptic might ask--a bit old-crankishly but not without reason--why this franchise needed to be rebooted in the first place or for that matter to be dragged into a world where ""franchise reboot"" is a meaningful combination of syllables. Such a review might speculate about our generations anxious melancholy yearning relationship to the pop culture of its youth how that yearning differs from that of earlier generations for whom television was less of an ambient childhood medium and what we gain from these ceremonies of mass regression. Maybe Ill ponder those questions one day--Lord knows the unadventurous tastes of Hollywood executives are likely to provide future chances to muse on generational nostalgia. But lets stipulate for the purposes of this discussion that this movie has a right to exist and evaluate it on its own terms. Unless youre such a purist that you have a Scooter puppet in its original packaging on a shelf in your bedroom your most pertinent questions as regards the new Muppet movie are probably a) Is it an abominable desecration? And b) Should I take Mom and the kids to see it on Thanksgiving? And the answers are respectively not at all and hell yeah. Directed by James Bobin (Da Ali G Show Flight of the Conchords) and co-written by Nicholas Stoller (Get Him To The Greek) and the films star Jason Segel the first big-screen Muppet adventure of the 21st century is an exuberant sunny musical thats occasionally tongue-in-cheek but never even remotely snarky. It respects the spirit of the original while finding ways to update it beginning by presupposing a world in which creatures of flesh and blood coexist alongside those of foam and felt. (Come to think of it that was also the case on both Sesame Street and the original The Muppet Show but there the human/muppet dichotomy was never acknowledged; Gordon and Big Bird didnt hang out on the stoop and contemplate the implications of their interspecies friendship.) As the film begins Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) live together as blissfully in-sync roomies rollerskating their way through a charmed small-town life. Yes Gary is human and Walter a puppet but the two have grown up together as ""brothers""--an opening childhood montage never shows the boys parents leaving open the question of whether theirs was a mixed flesh/felt marriage. Gary has a girlfriend the apple-pie-sweet schoolteacher and crackerjack mechanic Mary (Amy Adams at her fresh-scrubbed best) but he still sleeps in a twin bed alongside his small cloth buddy in matching plaid pajamas. Advertisement To celebrate his and Marys 10th anniversary () Gary buys bus tickets from their wholesome hamlet of Smalltown to Los Angeles. Walter comes along to Marys well-disguised disappointment--shed been hoping for a romantic vacation maybe even a proposal. But Walters passion for the long-canceled The Muppet Show is such that the couple agrees to take him on a tour of the old studios which have fallen into a sorry state of disrepair. There Walter accidentally eavesdrops on the heartless oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) whos plotting with his two evil puppet cohorts to destroy the old soundstage and drill for oil on the land. On stage Scott Garfield (c) Disney. Will Gary Mary and Walter be able to unite the old Muppet gang put on a show and raise the 10 million theyll need to hold on to the old theater? Cue the movies best 20 or so minutes in which the travelers visit in turn Kermit the Frog (voiced by Steve Whitmire) whos living in a decrepit Sunset Boulevard-style Hollywood mansion; Fozzie Bear (voiced by Eric Jacobson) whos performing in a sketchy Muppets tribute band in Reno; and Miss Piggy (also voiced by Jacobson) who in an inspired detail is now the plus-size editor for French Vogue. The remainder of the crew from blue-feathered daredevil Gonzo to chinless lab assistant Beaker are rounded up in a time-saving musical montage helpfully suggested by Kermits manservant a 1980s-vintage robot. The movies second half in which the felted vaudevilleans struggle to create and rehearse a fundraising telethon in a matter of days loses some of the head of steam built up in the first hour. There are too many competing story threads (Gary and Marys courtship Walters identity crisis an ill-fated plot to kidnap Jack Black) and Im not sure there exists a context in this movie or out in which we need to hear Chris Cooper rap. Whenever the energy starts to flag though an inspired musical number will come along to pep things up. When the whole company gathers onstage during the telethon for a group rendition of the classic Paul Williams/Kenny Ascher song ""The Rainbow Connection"" anyone born between the Johnson and Carter administrations may have trouble keeping it together. But the films musical tour de force is a plot-advancing power ballad co-written by Segel in which Gary and Walter ponder their reflections in the mirror as they ask that ultimate self-searching question ""Am I a man or am I a Muppet?"" In Jason Segel the filmmakers found perhaps the one actor who could infuse that existential dilemma with real ambivalence. Big floppy earnest and loveable Segel is a human Muppet of sorts--not to mention a lifelong enthusiast who for his role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall wrote and performed songs for an imagined ""vampire puppet musical."" The Muppets is in some ways the natural extrapolation of that project a sort of big-budget work of loving fan fiction. Its that sense that The Muppets springs from an individual vision--that its the complete opposite of a focus-grouped studio-driven ""reboot""--that sustains the film even through its weaker stretches. The creators of The Muppets clearly love their source material corny jokes and all and theyre eager to bring to a new generation what one character calls the ""third-greatest gift of all"" (laughter which apparently comes right after children and ice cream). Like Statler and Waldorf older viewers may kvetch and cavil about the details but when that red velvet curtain goes up we wouldnt give up our balcony seats for the world.

Like the beloved variety show that ran from 1976 to 1981 and its subsequent movie spinoffs the new return to glory has a habit of talking to the audience and reminding everyone that theyre sitting in a theater and watching a movie.Its a gleefully cynicism-free and self-aware walk down memory lane for anyone who liked the show. If you didnt youre probably not to be trusted in the first place.The self-referential touches start with our hero a young man named Walter who looks for all intents and human purposes to be a Muppet. In fact hes just a big fan. His best friend Gary is played by co-writer Jason Segel who proved his puppet bona fides with the showstopping Dracula musical at the end of Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Together with Garys girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) they set off to reunite the scattered Muppet gang for a telethon to save Muppet Studios from an evil oil baron (Chris Cooper).The Muppets is the definition of a kids movie made for adults especially adults of a certain age (yo right here). In this sense it follows the tradition of The Muppets TV series which was created as a grown-up alternative to Sesame Street.The humor is Borscht Belt with a postmodern edge that bounces through pop-culture references and happily dreadful puns (Fozzie Bear front and center). The musical numbers especially those written by Flight of the Conchords maestro Bret McKenzie are surefire smile generators. (The Muppets actually has quite a Conchords pedigree Director James Bobin created the late HBO series and Kristen Schaal has a cameo as Animals anger-management counselor.)Humans have always been key to the Muppet formula The ones who get it make everything run smoothly. Segel Adams Cooper Jack Black Emily Blunt and other special guests get it. Theyre young enough at heart to get a kick out of acting with puppets and savvy enough to get out of the way when they need to. (Though I could have died before seeing Cooper rap.)Still theres no question whos in charge here. Twenty-one years after Jim Hensons death Kermit and the gang still bring a shot of joy straight to the heart.The MuppetsA- Starring Jason Segel Amy Adams Steve Whitmire Eric Jacobson Jack Black Chris Cooper and Rashida Jones.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 23 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 239PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Arthur Christmas 3 stars The Muppets 2 stars At first blush they seem to have a lot in common. Both are kiddie flicks arriving early for the holiday season each intent on reviving and revitalizing a familiar bit of folklore. Arthur Christmas means to dust off the Santa myth; The Muppets wants to dust off its own myth. Movies The Muppets The official trailer Screen grab from the online trailer for the new animated feature ""Arthur Christmas"" Movies Arthur Christmas The official trailer In this film publicity image released by Disney Jason Segel is shown with muppet characters Kermit the Frog left and Miss Piggy in a scene from ""The Muppets."" Disney Enterprises Andrew Macpherson/AP Movies Video Segels childhood Muppet dream come true Kermit the Frog speaks at a press conference for the The Muppets Movie in Toronto on Tuesday Oct. 25 2011. CP Video video Video Kermit the Frog meets the press Being quick and clever and inventive one succeeds; being none of those things and weirdly apologetic to boot the other does not. Lets see why. Arthur Christmas is a cultural merger with the Brits at Aardman Productions (best known for the Wallace amp; Gromit series) providing the idiosyncratic content and the Yanks at Sony Pictures Animation offering the 3-D computer-generated style. It turns out to be a happy marriage largely because the content rules beginning with this delightful conceit Up in their North Pole residence the Clauses are actually a family dynasty a kind of roly-poly monarchy where the throne passes down through the generations. These days as the zippy opening sequence reveals the reigning Santa (Jim Broadbent) is largely a figurehead. On Christmas Eve the real work is done by his ambitious son Steve (Hugh Laurie) who with a vast spaceship for transport and a million elves under his command has brought global gift delivery into the modern age - its a high-tech operation now. Yet not quite fail-safe. Oops of all the worlds children seems ""one has been missed."" Gwen a little English girl with a posh little accent failed to receive the pink bike she was promised. For Steve a strict bean-counter who knows that ""Christmas is not a time for emotion"" the oversight falls easily within an acceptable margin of error. But Arthur (James McAvoy) his younger brother - an inveterate klutz with a kind heart a subordinate Claus relegated to the Letter Answering Department - begs to differ. Happily he has an ally in the cantankerous Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) long-retired yet eager to re-prove his mettle by dragging out all the old low-tech gear - that dusty sleigh the arthritic reindeer the ""magic dust."" So accompanied by a stowaway elf with a Scottish burr off the three head on their beat-the-clock mission. That bike must be delivered to Gwen before the sun rises on her disappointed face. Predictably there are wrong turns and misadventures en route. Predictably too those 3-D glasses do what they mainly do and prove more physically annoying than visually rewarding. Still for the kids the action is always lively and for the rest of us the dialogue has a witty and even caustic edge. Co-writer Peter Baynham whose resume includes a telling stint with Sacha Baron Cohen just cant help himself and finds in Grandsanta a convenient mouthpiece for his politically incorrect asides. Like this one Steve is quick to inform the others that with a mere two hours before dawn in England their altruistic escapade is ""impossible."" Snaps back our white-bearded curmudgeon ""They used to say it was impossible to teach women to read."" Oh Santa we hardly knew you. By contrast after a 12-year absence from the big screen The Muppets arent about to mess with their Day-Glo image. Nevertheless that absence looms oddly large in co-writer Jason Segels rather contrived script. Again and again sundry characters are heard to remark about Jim Hensons once-illustrious gang ""You guys arent famous any more""; or ""The world has moved on. No one cares about you."" Even Kermit himself is made to lament early on ""I guess people sort of forgot about us."" Of course the movie then sets out to correct such awful heresy. To that end after an opening production number as bright as it is forgettable Gary (Segel) along with his fiancee Mary (Amy Adams) and his little puppet bro Walter leave Smalltown to head for Tinseltown where they discover that the former Muppet Studio stands in near-ruin and is about to be razed by some avaricious Texan (Chris Cooper). Since a cool 10 million bucks are needed to save the studio theres only one remedy Dig out Kermie Miss Piggy Fonzie Gonzo et al. from their various hideaways then put on a network telethon to raise the cash and more important prove all those nay-saying cynics wrong. Several tunes umpteen cameo appearances scores of lame jokes and much up-beat sentimentalizing later the throngs on the Hollywood streets are cheering wildly but this old man in the gallery remains unconvinced. The Muppet charm always more at home within the intimate frame of a TV set is gone here. How to get it back? Hey ask Santa but make sure hes the nice jolly one and not that cranky ancestor - Grandsanta I fear would pronounce this revival D.O.A.

To understand how audacious it was for actor Jason Segel to take responsibility for Kermit and friends -- he drove this project starred in it and co-wrote the screenplay -- you have to understand first that the Muppets are still beloved enough to have inspired fans to launch a recent Oscar-hosting campaign. And you have to understand second that Jim Hensons death in 1990 is for some of them -- for some of us -- perhaps the most painful loss of a creative person in their lifetimes. The Muppets are one of the few remaining cultural creations about which even cynical people rarely express cynicism about which a deeply irony-infatuated popular culture rarely adopts any battle cry but a Kermit-like Yaaaaay To touch them is to lay yourself bare even more than Segel did in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Get it wrong and you will not be forgiven. Hes lucky he got it just about perfectly right. As The Muppets opens Gary (Segel) sets out for Hollywood with his brother Walter -- whos a Muppet but kind of doesnt know it -- and his girlfriend Mary played by the surprisingly Muppet-like Amy Adams. Walter idolizes the Muppets and is dying to tour their theater but when he gets there its deserted. The group has broken up and the place along with the right to use the Muppet name is about to fall to a nasty oil baron named Tex Richman (naturally) whos played by an energetically wicked Chris Cooper. The plot such as it is requires that Gary Mary and Walter round up the Muppets and put on a show to save the theater and the Muppet legacy while evading the evil oil magnate. Theres not much to it but then theres not much to 1979s The Muppet Movie either Its about rounding up the Muppets to go to Hollywood and put on a show to create the Muppet legacy while evading an evil frog-leg magnate. Now as then its just a reason for the Muppets to be themselves -- to crack jokes and sing songs to indulge in broadly cornball jokes both verbal and visual and to be profoundly joyfully Muppety. And as that kind of movie The Muppets is a rollicking touching funny success that brings back to life characters who faded after Henson died. i Who Moi?

With a telethon planned to help save the theater Kermit tries to convince Miss Piggy to give up her Paris fashion-editor job and return to the stage. Scott Garfield/Disney In the film the Muppets have been forgotten by the public because of the hard and cynical times in which we now live but there is a tacit acknowledgment of what really happened Kermit walks in the old theater looking at pictures of the old days and thinking about a comeback and he sings ""Would anybody watch or even care? Or did something break we cant repair?"" There is more sadness here than a simple ""We became obsolete in the age of the Internet"" lament can contain. Without reading too much subtext into what felt puppets are telling you Kermit is pretty obviously wondering whether they can return after the loss of their leader. You may be surprised to find yourself concluding that they can. Beyond its emotional heft The Muppets looks feels and sounds great. The new songs some by Bret McKenzie of Flight of the Conchords are funny and very well Muppety -- it says something about the tribes singular sensibility that thats the only right word no? -- and the production design is calculated to be timeless with fashions and colors that are bright and kid-friendly. The song-and-dance numbers are infectiously likable with twisted performances of catalog songs that are as weird and delightful as the ones that used to pop up on The Muppet Show. i Bork Bork Bork The Swedish Chef and his remarkably cooperative chickens wait mise en place for the telethon.

Scott Garfield/Disney And the celebrity cameos are as perfectly random as you could hope for. The Muppets is packed with genuine surprises you should try not to read about before you see the movie including an appearance from a CBS sitcom star that contains such demented genius that it seems both inspired and inevitable. Everyone remembers how The Muppet Movie began in 1979 Once the Muppets settle in to watch their own film we see Kermit on his log singing the surprisingly profound song ""The Rainbow Connection"" with his banjo. But just as important is how it ends -- with a haunting moment in which the Muppets project collapses around them a rainbow breaks through a hole in the ceiling and they turn directly to the camera and sing ""Lifes like a movie write your own ending keep believing keep pretending ... "" Theyre looking straight at you. You as a 6-year-old; you as an adult. You once-tiny now-giant Jason Segel. While The Muppets could easily have seemed like a cheap watery wannabe what it feels like is Segel and the rest of the creative team -- co-writer Nicholas Stoller director James Bobin (also of Flight of the Conchords) and everyone else involved -- taking that advice to heart. Lifes like a movie. Write your own ending. Keep believing keep pretending. If the original Muppet material was a gift from Henson and his staff to a generation that fell in love with it this is that generation indulging a desire to make more and pass it along. Segel and his team are not Jim Henson -- but theyve done justice to the lovers and the dreamers.

Comments (14) click to enlarge The Muppets Rated PG  98 minutes  2011 A recent appearance by Kermit the Frog on Saturday Night Lives ""Weekend Update"" reminds one that the Muppets owe their enduring popularity at least partly to their grown-up snark. Unfortunately this comeback movie a labor of love for mush-headed screenwriter and star Jason Segel errs on the side of sweetness and nostalgia; except for a few good zingers from balcony dwellers Statler and Waldorf there isnt much here for mom and dad. The plot is recycled from The Blues Brothers when a slimy oil tycoon (Chris Cooper) schemes to tear down the old Muppets theater and drill for oil Kermit reunites the old gang to stage a telethon and pay off the mortgage.

He shares credit for the screenplay with Nicholas Stoller and stars as Gary a small town innocent whose  ""brother"" a Muppet named Walter has no idea that he is a member of the Henson family he worships from afar. The movie reunites the far flung Muppets for a telethon after their old studio and good name is threatened. But its also a reunion of sorts for Segel. His past and present colleagues including Rashida Jones Neil Patrick Harris and Emily Blunt fill supporting roles and make cameos. Segel has played the droll and decent man in enough projects -- on television on How I Met Your Mother and Freaks and Geeks and in the movies Forgetting Sarah Marshall (which he also co-wrote with Stoller) and Bad Teacher -- to leave the impression that he is the actor youd most want your niece to marry. This Muppet business cements it; Segel must have the kindest instincts in Hollywood. Hes written his own character as a fellow who still sleeps in a twin bed in his childhood bedroom (which he shares with Walter) and though their meeting with the Muppets is precipitated by a trip to Los Angeles to celebrate his 10th anniversary with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) its entirely possible this man child has done no more than kiss her cheek. (MORE The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films) Who wants to criticize this guys best efforts? I must just a little. Thats not to say that I didnt have a lovely time at The Muppets or that I dont recommend it as a good time for families over the holidays. I absolutely do. At least half of my critical thinking went out of the window overwhelmed by sheer nostalgia. Throw Statler and Waldorf up in the balcony to grumble and perch Kermit on a rock to sing ""The Rainbow Connection"" afresh and I melt. During the movies best moments I recalled exactly what my long-gone fathers roars of laughter sounded like. Was it the joyous lunacy of ""Mahnamahna"" that used to set him off? I no longer remember but the sweetness of the movie coupled with memories of those times when he sank into a chair to watch the television show with me made me tear up several times. But nostalgia tends to come in waves and in between the peaks there are troughs. This is a singing and dancing musical. Yet other than a song in which Gary and Walter wonder separately insanely and hilariously whether they are Muppets or men the catchiest song in the film is a new version of ""Mahnamahna"" that plays over the credits. The rest are a schmaltzy blur songs of reflection and loneliness without enough jazzy numbers to provide a counter weight to the angst. ""Is there something more I could have done?"" warbles Kermit who Gary Walter and Mary find hiding out in a Beverly Hills mansion. Nobody has seen him in years and hes out of touch with the old gang. ""Or did something break we cannot repair?"" Here I wanted to rise up shouting ""Lies"" The Muppets transcend. They are of special genius. They dont need to slink back insecurely back into the frame of fame (although their last project the television film The Muppets Wizard of Oz released a mere six years ago was not well received). Witness the rapid increase in the movies pace as soon as there is critical Muppet mass. Kermit finds Fozzie Bear singing in a seedy club in Reno Gonzo is a plumbing magnate and Scooter works at Google and is snatched as hes headed off to the TED conference. Segel and Stollers writing shines in these goofy bits. On learning that Miss Piggy is living in Paris where shes the plus-size editor for Vogue (as if) the gang decides to ""travel by map"" driving their car right out of the ocean and onto French shores. That is classic Muppet style gently mocking the whole business of moviemaking while still participating in it. (MORE See the Top 10 Cartoon Theme Songs) But Segel and director James Bobin who knows something of weird fun from his role in creating Flight of the Concords wade in and out of their new Muppet story almost apologetically; the colorful characters are allegedly passe forgotten. ""Nobody cares about your goody-goody hippie-dippie Julie Andrews Dom DeLouise-loving act anymore"" sneers oil baron Tex Richman (a hilarious Chris Cooper) who buys the old Muppet studio to tear it down and drill for oil. Hes the reason for the telethon; the Muppets need to raise 10 million to buy back the studio. But theyre no longer ready for prime time; Jones plays the executive who gives them a spot only after her reality show Punch Teacher has to be pulled for legal reasons. Everyone likes to be catered to but this felt too skewed to my demographic to the people weaned on Sesame Street and the The Muppet Show. If you are five you care nothing for this backstory. You have not been wondering Where are those Muppets? Instead you are in the same camp as Selena Gomez in her cameo (""My agent told me to show up"") -- clueless but willing.  Soon enough though shes under their sway. Thats what happens; the Muppets are irresistible. The telethon itself hosted by a major comic star theyd kidnapped sparkles with zany energy and intelligence. Even Walter somewhat generic to this point has a dazzling moment. So dont apologize Muppets. Now that youre back please stick around.

Starring Amy Adams Jason Segel Chris Cooper Rashida Jones Director James Bobin Running time 138 Release Opened Nov 23 2011  Editorial Review They break a leg or would if they couldBy Michael OSullivanWednesday Nov. 23 2011The Muppets have never been the most loose-limbed performers. Sitting on a persons forearm tends to limit ones flexibility. In the new movie ""The Muppets"" however Kermit and Co. bend over backward to make sure that everyone - and I mean everyone - is happy. How else to explain a movie that includes a juvenile gag about shoes made from whoopee cushions an ironic reference to ""Benson"" reruns and a parade of celebrity cameos ranging from Mickey Rooney to Ken Jeong? (Dont worry Mom and Dad. Jeongs appearance is a world away from his performance in the ""Hangover"" flicks.) For the most part the contortions are successful. ""The Muppets"" is both a delightful family film about the Muppets and a winking self-referential satire about how lame the Muppets are. How does it manage that trick? By starting from the premise that the Muppets are has-beens. When the film opens Kermit has disappeared from public view and is living in Howard Hughes-like seclusion; Fozzie Bear is eking out a living in a second-rate cover band called the Moopets; and the ever-volatile Animal is in anger-management therapy with Jack Black. Just about the only one who has landed on her feet is Miss Piggy who is now editor of French Vogue (with Emily Blunt reprising her ""The Devil Wears Prada"" turn as Piggys snooty office assistant). Its a giggle and it works a strange kind of magic. You can laugh at them and with them at the same time. What sets the plot in motion is a visit to Los Angeles by Gary (Jason Segel) and Mary (Amy Adams) a pair of Smalltown sweethearts - yes thats the name of the place theyre from - who are accompanied on their trip by Garys somewhat co-dependent brother Walter. In a twist Walter isnt played by a person but by a puppet (voiced by Peter Linz). Walter is also something of a Muppets groupie. When he arrives in Hollywood he cant quite accept the fact that his heroes are washed up. With the assistance of Gary and Mary Walter sets out to reunite the Muppets for one last show the proceeds from which will be used to save the decrepit Muppet Studios building from being torn down by an unscrupulous developer (Chris Cooper). Walter has long dreamed of working with the Muppets. So far so corny. What saves ""The Muppets"" from itself is a sharp eye for just how silly all of this is. Directed by James Bobin (a regular writer and director on ""The Flight of the Conchords"") and co-written by Segel and Nicholas Stoller (an alumnus of ""Strangers With Candy"" and ""Undeclared"") the film is mordant without being mean and sweet without being saccharine. If falling in love with something built around the exhortation ""believe in yourself"" sounds like drinking the Kool-Aid then its Kool-Aid with a splash of vodka. If the ""The Muppets"" is sap its sophisticated self-aware sap. Its hard enough to appeal to todays kids let alone their parents. If you can make the unmarried 20-something aunts and uncles laugh too so much the better. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is a musical number in which Gary addresses his own reflection envisioned as a Muppet caricature of himself. (Garys worried about not being man enough for Mary whom hes been dating without commitment for 10 years.) At the same time Walter is shown singing to his reflection envisioned as a real live person - and played in pitch-perfect deadpan by Jim Parsons of ""The Big Bang."" (Parsons is a metaphor for Walters need to become his own person.) The cinematic risk factor is high. For a minute ""The Muppets"" teeters between cheeky ""SNL"" skit and cheesy homage to old Hollywood. But it pulls off the stunt brilliantly. Like the characters of Gary a man whos afraid hes been acting like a Muppet and Walter a Muppet who aspires to be a man ""The Muppets"" is a movie with a highly entertaining identity crisis.

More about The Muppets >> And indeed there is something hopeful about The Muppets - Disneys rollicking reboot of the late Jim Hensons furball franchise. The seventh Muppet movie and the first since 1999s intergalactic dud Muppets From Space this one sprang from Forgetting Sarah Marshall star Jason Segels deep and abiding affection for Kermit Rowlf Gonzo et al. He and Sarah Marshalls writer/director Nicholas Stoller were determined to return the Muppets to their glory - to goofball song-and-dance numbers to slapstick silliness to winking we-know-this-is-a-movie cutup commentary. To all of that but with heart. And mission accomplished. Stoller and Segel scripted; James Bobin veteran of the nutty deadpan series Flight of the Conchords directed; and the Conchords Bret McKenzie wrote the new tunes. Beginning with a dopily upbeat but still impossibly charming sing-along called ""Lifes a Happy Song"" (it starts as a simple duet and ends with all of Smalltown USA kicking up their heels) The Muppets treats its titular heroes with affection and respect even as Fozzie Bear shows off his ""fart shoes"" and toilet humor abounds. The aforementioned Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) is the diminutive sibling to Segels Gary. The possibly peculiar fact that one is a tiny puppet and the other a lumbering human is never addressed - theyre brothers so there. And when Gary and his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) plan a trip to Los Angeles to celebrate their anniversary they take Walter along. The legendary Muppet Studio is there and Walter cant wait. But the Muppets glory days are long gone the studio is a ghostly shambles and Walter by dint of having hidden under a table in Kermits office overhears a greedy oil barons scheme to level the Muppet Theater and surrounding studio and drill for crude. Chris Cooper keeping a straight face and even diving into a rap number is the arch-villain Tex Richman. And so Walter (and Gary and Mary) hunt down Kermit tell him of the sinister plan and then head hither and yon to collect the disbanded Muppets and organize a reunion and a telethon to raise the 10 million needed to save the studio. Cameos by Jack Black Zach Galifianakis Sarah Silverman Rashida Jones and Emily Blunt ensue. And Neil Patrick Harris Selena Gomez Mickey Rooney David Grohl Judd Hirsch John Krasinski and James Carville show up as themselves. Segel manages to seem completely in the reality of the moment while also standing outside of it chortling appreciatively while Adams plays wide-eyed and perky - but can still look mighty perturbed. Gary doesnt get it that she wants intimate time with her beau. Oblivious he lets Walter tag along wherever they go obsessing about Kermie and company. And Kermie and company are in top form. Miss Piggy has moved on - shes an Anna Wintour-like fashion mag diva working out of Paris - and it takes all of the affable amphibians persuasive powers to get her to agree to come back to L.A. and help the gang.

Wocka wocka this way Fozzie Miss Piggy Kermit and the rest of the gang are back in ""The Muppets."" (Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everet) Needing to raise 10 million to save the theater hosting ""The Muppets"" from destruction Kermit the Frog tells a couple of fans (Jason Segel Amy Adams) the only way to do it would be to gather the old gang and put on a show. But Kermit rejects the idea. ""This"" notes Adams ""is going to be a really short movie."" As Fozzie Bear would say Wocka wocka Heaping with love for the felt puppets for implausibly giddy musical numbers and for getting stuck in childhood the Muppet relaunch is as it should be the most sensational inspirational celebrational treat you could wish for on a holiday weekend. So what if kids may not get the sly references to The Economist Nirvana ""Kill Bill"" and Mickey Rooney? The rugrats are just cover anyway -- an excuse for Gen-X adults to dive in. Just as ""The Muppet Show"" was in part a sendup of corny vaudeville routines Segels rethink (he co-wrote the script with ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" director Nicholas Stoller) spoofs movie and musical conventions such as awkwardly crammed-in story exposition montages and the way rain always appears when the starlet feels like singing a sad song. Gary (Segel) is a man-boy who grows up in Smalltown USA with a best friend who dresses like him is 3 feet high and is made of felt. He Walter (a new Muppet) discovers he is not alone when he sees ""The Muppet Show"" on TV. Walter decides to take Gary to Hollywoods Muppet Theater but Garys fiancee (Adams) wonders why the two of them cant have a romantic getaway a deux. Gary and Walters plan to spend their vacation on a visit to the Muppet Theater is doomed because the stars have split up (Fozzie is living on a fire escape in Reno) and unless they can raise 10 million a heartless tycoon is going to destroy the theater and drill for oil under it. The fondly named oilman Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) has Muppet henchmen who worry ""Do you think were working for the bad guy?"" Heres a clue Whenever he does something evil he says this ""maniacal laughter."" The Muppet DNA is pleasingly intertwined with that of ""Flight of the Conchords"" the absurd deadpan and brilliant HBO comedy co-created by this movies director James Bobin. ""FOTC"" band member Bret McKenzie helped write songs for ""The Muppets"" and co-star Kristen Schaal pops up -- coaching an anger-management group whose patients include Muppet drummer Animal and (as himself) the only slightly less beastlike Jack Black. Zach Galifianakis also appears which may be the most redundant casting since Dom DeLuise and James Coco both popped up in ""Wholly Moses"" (Also Galifianakis continues not being funny.) The sketch-comedy nature of the movie is probably better suited to the 30-minute block. (At a point when I thought things must be winding up I looked at my watch and only an hour had passed.) Many jokes are ""blackouts"" -- pull-the-rug-out gags that are best in small doses and some of those doses have expired. Still there are several adorable musical numbers that make excellent use of Adams. Segels dancing is . . . well he reminded me of a huge star Big Bird. I wont spoil the moment by telling you which character busts out a hilarious rap. Segel and Stoller come up with delightfully wacky innovations such as a bizarro gang of mean muppets -- the Moopets -- with scowling faces and gangsta tendencies. Miss Piggy works for French Vogue (where her assistant is straight out of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and where she is known as Mademoiselle Cochonnet). Chickens gabble out a song sometimes called ""Forget You"" that can now be rechristened ""Cluck You."" And in a moment that has already gone viral the Muppets channel a fellow strange big-eyed and fuzzy creature -- Kurt Cobain. If anyone could have benefited from kicking back with Gonzo the Great and the Swedish chef it was Mister Sadface Gloomy Rocker Guy.

"Muppets The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; muppets-the ) Muppets The (United States 2011) November 22 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Muppets is a rare family film likely to appeal more to parents than to their offspring. Although its true that most kids today know a thing or two about Jim Hensons creations (the movies premise - that they have vanished into obscurity since the early 1980s - is an exaggeration) the Muppets are ingrained in the older generations DNA. Its hard to imagine anyone between the ages of 35 and 50 who didnt grow up with the loveable puppets either on Sesame Street or The Muppet Show or in the early movies. Technically The Muppets is classified as a ""musical comedy"" but this is essentially a 97-minute exercise in nostalgia. Its the Muppets as they havent been since Jim Henson died a throwback to the time when their TV show was popular and their first movie 1979s The Muppet Movie was a bona fide hit. Kids today will have the same kind of fun at The Muppets they have at all films of this kind. Adults however will connect in a deeper way. The storyline as has always been the case with the Muppets is an excuse for singing dancing witty exchanges high-profile cameos and the magic that happens when the old school felt-and-fuzz creatures come together on screen. Like the television program this is more variety show than traditional narrative and it has been assembled with obvious affection by all those involved. Despite the passage of decades the Muppets have not noticeably changed. Advances in technology have not impacted them. They have not been ""enhanced"" by the use of CGI. And although two of the original ""voices"" are no longer participants (Henson having died and Frank Oz having retired from puppeteering) Kermit Miss Piggy Fozzie and the rest of the gang sound pretty much the same. The Muppets proves that sometimes the best approach is not to tinker with a successful formula. The thin plot focuses on Walter (voice of Peter Linz) a Muppet-like ""boy"" (who looks a little like Bert) whose lifelong dream is to visit the Muppet Studio in California. When his big brother Gary (Jason Segel) heads to Hollywood for a vacation with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) Gary invites Walter to come along. While touring the falling-down remains of the Muppet Studio Walter stumbles upon a dastardly plot hatched by the villainous Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) hes going to buy the Muppet Studio and raze it to get at the oil reserves buried beneath the land. Walter aghast seeks out the only one who can stop this Kermit the Frog. But finding Kermit only solves part of the problem because in order to stop Tex 10 million needs to be raised. Kermit does the only thing possible - he reunites the Muppets and gets them a two-hour television slot in which to resurrect The Muppet Show as a telethon. As one might expect the human actors in The Muppets dont have a lot to do. The stars Jason Segel (who also co-executive produced and co-wrote the movie) and Amy Adams get a chance to sing and dance but other than that their primary function is to smile and be cheerful. Chris Cooper lets down his hair (figuratively) and goes deliciously over-the-top especially in his one big number ""Lets Talk about Me."" Jack Black plays an exaggerated version of himself and one could argue this is the best performance he has given in a long time. The Muppets features six new musical numbers and three ""classics"" including ""The Muppet Show Theme"" and ""The Rainbow Connection."" Both are likely to stir memories for those who watched the television show and saw the first movie. (Since ""The Rainbow Connection"" received radio play in 1979 and charted in the Top 30 one didnt even need to see the film to be exposed to it.) Many of the Muppets from their heyday have at least token appearances - the only one I noticed as m.i.a. is Rizzo the Rat. The dialogue is frequently witty and occasionally breaks the ""fourth wall."" Both were trademarks of the early Muppets era. Also in keeping with the first three Muppet movies theres a cavalcade of cameos including Mickey Rooney Emily Blunt Sarah Silverman Alan Arkin Whoopi Goldberg Selena Gomez Neil Patrick Harris and James Carville. Jack Blacks role as the kidnapped host of the Muppet Show Telethon is substantially larger than a cameo - his total screen time rivals that of Chris Cooper. Simply put The Muppets is good fun. The filmmakers understand not only the enduring appeal of Kermit and friends but are able to capture what they were like 30 years ago. The movie is designed for anyone who ever fell under the spell of Jim Hensons unlikely TV and movie stars. The token message - about the importance of ""family"" in its various permutations - is in keeping with what the Muppets have always been about. We were all like Walter and when we welcomed them into our homes on a weekly basis in the late 1970s they repaid us with the magic of memories. Now director James Bobin has tapped into what made the Muppets unique and re-invigorated them not only for a new generation but for the old one as well.

Those Carter-era staples magically combined anarchic lunacy--how many ballroom-dancing scenes with Gonzo and Camilla his hen sweetheart ended in explosion?--with unapologetic squareness. Moldy talents such as Ruth Buzzi and Zero Mostel were the guest stars on The Muppet Show; Dom DeLuise and Milton Berle cameoed in The Muppet Movie. The original foam fleece and fur performers were assured showbiz veterans who never worried about being hip; their irreverent sensibility made them timeless. Unable to resist one of the more appalling trends in kids movies over the past decade the reboot in contrast features Camilla and a bunch of backup chickens clucking to Cee Los ""Forget You.""The Muppets is the first film by British-TV vet James Bobin (Da Ali G Show The Flight of the Conchords); it is largely the labor of love of diehard Muppets fan Jason Segel who co-wrote the script with his Forgetting Sarah Marshall director Nicholas Stoller. Segel also stars as Gary protective big brother of Walter a sweet if dull new Muppet created for the film who is revealed in the opening scenes to be absolutely nuts about Kermit and associates watching the TV show over and over. Although this sibling relationship remains faithful to one of the main tenets of Hensons universe--that the Muppets always think of themselves as animate beings in the real world not as puppets--it upsets the balance in the ecosystem In the past humans have been drop-in visitors in this world of fabric creatures not peers.Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) Gary and Garys girlfriend of 10 years schoolteacher Mary (Amy Adams) leave their Midwestern hamlet of Smalltown for a trip to Los Angeles where the highlight is a tour of the decrepit dusty Muppet Studios. The trio learns of a plot by tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) to tear down the building to dig for oil. They frantically seek out Kermit and convince him he must reunite his long-lost pals to save the studio. (A conceit not so far removed from reality Disney which after a series of botches and setbacks finally bought the Muppets in 2004 14 years after Hensons death is hoping for new-franchise gold with this big-screen rejuvenation of the long-stagnating characters.)Certain moments of Kermits quest recall the vaudevillian fun of its predecessors. The Muppets is most successful when devoted to gathering the old players and following the arc of its forebears by becoming a show about the frenzy of putting on a show--in this case a telethon to raise the 10 million needed to buy back the studio. Fozzie is found doing stand-up in Reno with a lousy tribute act the Moopets who perform a reggae cover of ""The Rainbow Connection."" Miss Piggy sporting a Chanel suit and a Samantha Jones-like coiffure is finally convinced--after a constitutional through the streets of Paris with Kermit--to leave her post as the plus-size editor for French Vogue to contribute her talents to the TV fundraiser. These characters at least have been sharply updated without their 21st-century details seeming like lazy razzing of pop culture; Animal retrieved from court-appointed anger-management sessions doesnt fare as well.There was a charming meta-ness to the 79 movie which was structured as both a film-within-a-film and an origin story and included a few sly winks to the audience. Straining for that same vibe this Muppets overreaches its characters constantly making references to the musical numbers they just completed.In their heyday Hensons witty smart-alecky weirdos though of course popular with kids also appealed to grown-ups. Terrified of alienating those who were raised on the originals The Muppets panders to them instead constantly blasting or restaging Top 40 hits from the past three-plus decades continuing the cheap strategy that worked well on YouTube two years ago with the Muppets cover of ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" The handful of serviceable new songs composed for the film by Bret McKenzie includes the requisite execrable rap. ""I think kids are better and smarter than this junk"" Kermit tells Rashida Joness TV executive who explains to him why the Muppets are no longer relevant in an era of Punch Teacher her networks most popular show. Adults are too.

""The Muppets Show"" with its wacky oddball humor was considered hip must-see television. Muppet films were big at the box office. The characters were ingrained in the psyche of a whole generation.But by the early 1980s the Muppets were taking a long slide off the radar screen. The TV show was a pleasant memory. The movies were no longer big hits (there hasnt be one since ""Space Muppets"" in 1999). Jim Henson -- the genius behind the fur and fuzz and the longtime voice of Kermit -- died in 1990. When the Muppet franchise was sold to Disney in 2004 it barely caused a ripple.But with ""The Muppets"" which opens Wednesday a whole new generation might come to love the characters created by Henson and his colleagues thanks to some modern-day hipsters better known for edgy R-rated comedy than family entertainment. Cowritten by Judd Apatow acolytes Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller (""Get Him to the Greek"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and directed by James Bobin (HBOs ""Flight of the Conchords"") the movie is endearing and charming with all the good-natured spirit of Muppets past but with enough sly self-aware wit to keep it from being a nostalgia piece.Perhaps the smartest thing Segel and Stoller do with the script is openly acknowledge the tattered state of the franchise. ""I guess people sort of forgot us"" says Kermit at one point early in the film.Advertisement Segel and Amy Adams play Gary and Mary two rather naive grown-ups from Smalltown U.S.A. who decide to take a dream trip to Los Angeles bringing along Garys brother Walter who is a Muppet but doesnt really know it. Walters big wish visit the famous Muppet studios.When the trio arrive at the studio they find it in total disrepair. The only tourists to visit mistake it for Universal Studios. But then Walter overhears an evil oil baron (Chris Cooper clearly having a ball) plotting to tear down the Muppet house. The only way to save it is to raise 10 million in a few days; the only solution reunite the Muppets.Gary Mary and Walter track down Kermit living by himself in a Bel Air mansion straight out of ""Sunset Boulevard."" Kermit is more than a bit hesitant about a reunion singing ""Would anyone watch or even care or did something break we cant repair?"" (In response Mary looks at the camera and says ""This is going to be a really short movie."")But Kermit eventually decides the Muppets just have to put on one last show and helps to round up the rest of the gang Fozzie Bear fronting a faux Muppets act in Reno; Gonzo who has become a plumbing tycoon; Animal enrolled in an anger management class; Scooter working for Google; and Miss Piggy now the editor at Paris Vogue. Needless to say they run into some problems -- their idea for a telethon gets turned down by every network including Univision -- but in the end the show goes on in a way that will bring a lump in the throats of the adults who fondly remember the TV series. After all who can resist Kermit singing ""Rainbow Connection"" one more time?The film is loaded with everything Muppets fans love loopy musical production numbers very funny montages some hilarious asides and weird little moments such as a barbershop quartet version of Nirvanas ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" Bobin making his feature film debut sets a quick pace early on and keeps it up through the rousing finale.The actors undoubtedly knew going in that they were going to be upstaged by the puppets but they eagerly play along. Segel projects goofy charm as Gary and Adams smartly does her smart nice-girl persona (see ""Enchanted""). It""s worth the price of a ticket just to see Cooper gleefully rip through the rap number ""Lets Talk About Me.""And then there are the cameos another staple of Muppet world ranging from Emily Blunt as Miss Piggys secretary to Zach Galifianakis as Hobo Joe. The two best come from an uncredited Jack Black as the telethons very reluctant guest host and Jim Parsons from TVs ""Big Bang Theory."" I wont spoil the Parsons bit but when he turned up in the musical number ""Man or Muppet"" it brought the house down at the screening I attended.It should be noted that clearly I am writing this from the perspective of an adult who loved the Muppets in their heyday. Will the younger moviegoers have the same connection? Maybe not -- but Segel Stoller and Bobin certainly have created something that might click with newcomers without disrespecting the Muppets past.And be sure to get to your seat on time. Playing ahead of the film is another ""Toy Story"" short from Pixar this one involving Buzz Lightyear and a support group for Happy Meal toys. Its terrific and serves as a reminder of the Muppets influence on family entertainment.The Muppets    Rating PG (for some very mild rude humor)Cast Jason Segel Amy Adams Chris Cooper and the MuppetsDirector James BobinRunning time 1 hour 50 minutes (including a ""Toy Story"" short)Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"The Muppets are sweet and subversive Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MuppetsMovie review The Muppets are sweet and subversiveGary (Jason Segel) Mary (Amy Adams) and Walter (Walter) round up Kermit Miss Piggy and the gang to save the Muppets theater in this charming musical comedy.November 23 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Amy Adams Jason Segel and a full cast of Muppets star in ""The Muppets."" (Patrick Wymore / Disney...)You know times are tough when even the Muppets are facing bankruptcy or worse playing in a Muppet tribute band. What happened to the ""rainbow connection""? That and more will be answered with nostalgic charm and big splashy production numbers in the very warm and fuzzy musical comedy of ""The Muppets."" The movie stars Jason Segel Amy Adams Chris Cooper and pretty much every Muppet that has ever graced a screen small or large since the late Jim Henson first brought them to life many decades ago. This newest Muppet fable begins in an idyllic slice of 50s-era Americana Smalltown USA with old home movies of best friends and brothers Gary (Segel) and Walter (Walter in an impressive acting debut). Though no one makes a mention of it Gary is a human and Walter is a puppet that blended reality one of the conceits the Muppets have exploited so well from the beginning. As you might imagine Smalltown is a grand place to grow up The grass is always green kids love going to school and universal happiness (if not healthcare) is a given. Mary (Adams) and Gary are sweethearts getting ready to celebrate their 10th anniversary together and heading to Hollywood to do it. The romance is all very chaste which is good because the twosome quickly becomes a threesome with Walter tagging along. A huge Muppets fan Walters just dying to tour the troupes old studio. If this were a different world right about now Mary would issue an its-me-or-the-puppet ultimatum but she just sighs and makes room in the car. The villain here is oilman Tex Richman (Cooper) a tycoon whos about to take control of the famed Muppet theater which has definitely gone to seed. While Walters savoring a few moments in Kermits old office he happens to overhear the specifics of Texs nefarious plans and knows the only way to save the day or at least the property is to get the frog involved. And that he does. Kermits living large but alone in his Hollywood manse. Miss Piggys in Paris a plus-size fashion editor for Vogue. The others have scattered to the four winds or Reno. But before you know it and with a little movie magic Kermit has rounded up the old gang and the filmmakers have had a few laughs at Hollywoods expense. Segel whos got lovable schlub down to a science and Adams not quite as enchanting as she was as the fairy tale princess in 2007s ""Enchanted"" but close enough are perfectly cast. They are completely at ease in a world filled with Muppets and Muppet problems and totally game for the huge musical numbers. Walter a newcomer the filmmakers added is adorably insecure and a good addition to the house that Henson built which included so many iconic characters a the out-of-control Animal comes to mind among many favorites. One of the movies delights is all the subversive parody slipped into its very smart script by co-writers Segel and Nicholas Stoller (""Get Him to the Greek""). The pair self-professed die-hard fans included a small Muppet homage in their collaboration on ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" but thought a why not put on a whole new movie which is not unlike the ""why dont we put on a show"" idea that drives the action here. With ""Flight of the Conchords"" alum James Bobin directing and one of the shows creators/stars Bret McKenzie contributing three new songs among other things there is a clever edginess that helps keep the film afloat. That sensibility is very much a franchise tradition considering Henson called a 1975 TV pilot ""The Muppet Show Sex and Violence"" and took a few well-aimed shots at the controversy. Youll bump into a famous face doing a funny cameo around nearly every corner Jack Blacks most frequently. Many of them remain uncredited for now to keep the surprise though Id just suggest you keep an eye out for the most fabulous one which hits with a big bang. For all its sharpness the movie has a very sweet streak. Its Technicolor gloss (director of photography Don Burgess Oscar nominated for another fable ""Forrest Gump"") and ""Leave It to Beaver"" fashion sense (Rahel Afiley on costumes Steve Saklad on production design both outstanding) do much to create the feel of a more innocent time. Still the filmmakers are definitely playing around with the form breaking the fourth wall and messing with movie conventions when it suits them. There are a few stumbles but not too many and by the time Gary and Walter get to a showstopping number that asks the burning question a ""Am I a man or a Muppet?"" a you are completely hooked. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMuppets Most Wanted a weak sequel early reviews sayMarch 12 2014The Contenders Its easy being Bret McKenzieDecember 8 2011Breaking Dawn wins box office; Muppets has respectable...November 28 2011The Muppets Kermit the Frog commands Jason Segels...November 6 2011Being Elmo The Muppets show puppets real touchOctober 30 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMuppetsJason SegelJim HensonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-the-muppets-20111123,0,516379.story?track=rss",200,themuppets25,themuppets,latimes

Director James Bobin a veteran of edgier comic fare like HBOs Flight of the Conchords and Da Ali G Show embraces the innocent upbeat style of the show conceived by Henson who died in 1990.Theres enough nostalgia for those who grew up on the gang and sufficient goofy amusement for children who are being introduced to the colorful puppets. About the movieThe Muppets  1/2 out of fourStars Jason Segel Amy Adams Chris Cooper Emily Blunt Jack Black Rashida Jones Director James BobinDistributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG for some mild rude humor Running time 2 hours Opens Wednesday nationwideThe movie also inducts a new Muppet into the mix Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) the beloved brother of man-child Gary (Segel). Amy Adams is perfectly cast as Garys bubbly girlfriend Mary.When Gary Mary and Walter take a vacation from their small town to Hollywood they make a stop at the rundown Muppet Studios. There they learn of a dastardly plot being hatched by a ruthless millionaire (Chris Cooper) to raze the site and drill for oil.Shaken they set out to find the Muppets coax them out of retirement and convince them to stage a show to raise money to buy the place back.First stop Kermit the Frog. The leggy green guy rattles around his mansion wondering why people dont care about The Muppets anymore. (The top-rated TV show in this universe is one where students punch their teachers.)Kermit has never gotten over his love for Piggy who has become the editor of a Parisian fashion magazine (she sports Vogue editor Anna Wintours hairstyle and has Emily Blunt as her secretary a laThe Devil Wears Prada).Gary Mary and Walter rocket around finding Fozzie Bear Gonzo and the rest of the gang in a playful segment that mocks film conventions and the oft-used shorthand of montages.Segel and Stoller stock the movie with cute celebrity cameos including Neil Patrick Harris and Lady Gaga. The action is nimbly paced with an energetic score that mixes signature tunes with new material like the theme song Lifes a Happy Song.The cast -- plushy felt or flesh and bone -- is winningly cheery but never in a schmaltzy way. Despite self-aware jokes about the gangs waning relevance the filmmakers point to the value of the Muppets good-natured idealism over cynicism. Cue The Rainbow Connection which remains as sweet a tune as ever. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Not from nostalgia but in appreciation of an energetic affectionate ticklefest. This reboot captures the creativity and talent of the best Muppet extravaganzas sidestepping the slack plots and guest-star overload (Dabney Coleman Linda Lavin Ed Koch) of the worst. It proves theres a place for Kermit and Miss Piggy in a world of computer-generated kiddie movies. The film inhabits that breezy Crayola-colored movieland where characters break into song to explain their feelings extras dressed like milkmen cops and librarians perform perfect chorus line kicks and traveling to France is as simple as plotting a red line on a map. Jason Segel stars as Gary who has grown to adulthood in this apple-pie world. His felt-and-foam brother Walter has remained approximately 3 feet tall and 10 years old. No I cant explain that. Go ask your mother. Gary is determined to make Walters lifelong dream come true with a tour of the fabulous Muppet Studios in Hollywood. Gary brings along his fiancee Mary (Amy Adams) to celebrate their anniversary because shed enjoy that right? They find the studio a cobwebbed shambles visited only by rare hardcore fans and lost Chinese tourists with a morose Alan Arkin the tour guide. Walter learns of a plan to raze the dream factory for oil drilling. With the old Muppet team disbanded how can they raise the 10 million needed to rescue the studio? If only there were some way to reunite the old troupe and put on a telethon One of the satisfactions of the well structured screenplay (written by Segel who clearly adores every last critter down to Pepe the Prawn) is how it allows the surreal nonsense and clever character humor to coexist. Gonzo Animal and the rest all have drifted off to lives that fit their personalities and must be hauled out of their doldrums to save the day. When theyre rounded up in a montage Rowlf asks why his back story wasnt included. So they back up and give him his moment too. When the cameo celebrities pile into the story that becomes a joke in itself. Selena Gomez admits she doesnt know who the Muppets are ""My agent just told me to show up."" THE MUPPETS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for mild rude humor. RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings The human actors have a chance to go stratospherically over the top and they relish the opportunity. Segel tears into a sing-your-heart-out-in-the-rain ballad called ""Man or Muppet"" (most of the new songs are written by ""Flight of the Conchords"" star Bret McKenzie). Adams belts out her lonely gal blues in a restaurant to the awkward puzzlement of the other diners. The blue ribbon goes to Chris Cooper as evil oil baron Tex Richman. Hes so joyless that he cant emit a proper maniacal laugh. He merely says ""maniacal laugh."" But when its time for his aint-I-despicable character song Cooper raps like a saggy pants gangsta. I approached the film with some trepidation but it took three minutes to win me over. Even Fozzies ""fart shoes"" joke which looks so crass in the trailer is a crackup in context. Word has circulated for a couple of weeks that Frank Oz one of the Muppets founding fathers felt that the script was disrespectful to the characters. Phooey. Oz supplied the voice of Yoda for those awful ""Star Wars"" prequels; what does he know? This is one puppet show I recommend with no strings attached.

Share Tweet The Muppets didnt disappear after 1999s Muppets From Space their last big-screen feature but it started to seem that way after a while. Sure there were TV movies and the occasional special but it felt like the Muppets had started to move to the far margins of pop culture as they became a relic of one of its past ages. The Muppets a new feature film starring the characters not only acknowledges their fade from relevance it bases the entire film around it. Co-written by star Jason Segel and Forgetting Sarah Marshall director Nicholas Stoller The Muppets takes place in a world thats dropped the Muppets in favor of garish violent kids programs like Punch Teacher which is just what it sounds like. The Muppets themselves havent helped. For reasons never fully explained theyve disbanded leaving the studio lot that once housed The Muppet Show to fall into ruin and the world of entertainment poorer for their absence. The self-aware conceit is clever at first but grows tedious as the film dwells on it. When Segel his brother Walter (a Muppet raised in a human family and obsessed with The Muppet Show) and Segels girlfriend (Amy Adams) travel to Los Angeles they find the Muppet kingdom in disarray. After learning that an evil oilman (Chris Cooper) has designs on destroying what remains of the Muppets home base they seek out Kermit The Frog and convince him to reunite the old gang. Much of what follows moons over what a shame it is that everyone has forgotten the Muppets and how great it would be if the Muppets were stars again. The film tugs hard at the heartstrings of nostalgia-prone viewers who grew up with Jim Hensons characters while often forgetting that it needs to make a case for why we should still care about the Muppets. Any kids seeing Kermit and friends for the first time here might wonder why the little felt things act so sad all the time. Fortunately when The Muppets remembers its supposed to be funny it makes a pretty good case for its stars continued relevance. Frank Oz opted not to step out of voiceover retirement for the project and shortly before its release he groused about the script not staying true to the Muppet spirit. Long the voice and puppeteer for Fozzie Miss Piggy and others Oz is missed but the film finds the Muppets heart without him. The Muppet Show and the early Muppet films harnessed an unlikely combination of irreverence and winsomeness. Hensons characters maintained an essential innocence while sending up the very idea of entertainment. They put on a show with quotation marks around it but the irony never felt cynical. When it isnt getting bogged down in unearned sentiment The Muppets gets that right. The songs largely written by Flight Of The Conchords Bret McKenzie are cute and clever and the gags are witty from a group of low-life Muppet rip-offs called The Moopets to Kermits 1980s-vintage robot manservant whos always happy to serve up a Tab or a can of New Coke. And even when it gets bogged down in angst and misconceived moments--a Muppetized take on ""We Built This City"" belongs on the cutting-room floor--The Muppets remains fundamentally likeable. It does star Muppets after all. Now having reassured one generation that theres still life in the funny animals that entertained them as kids it might be time to make some memories for the next generation to feel nostalgic about in the future.

So when I saw Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) the new Muppet character from ""The Muppets"" have that same dream about following Kermit and Fozzie and Miss Piggy to the other side of the glass I knew that the Muppets return to the big screen was in loving and capable hands. Sure the plot here borrows heavily from ""The Muppet Movie"" (this time Kermit has to reunite everyone rather than get the band together) and the made-for-TV ""Its a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie"" (evil financier wants to steal the Muppets theater; Chris Coopers oil billionaire steps in for Joan Cusacks banker). But ""The Muppets"" has the same brilliant absurdity anarchic humor subtle uplift and ensemble comedy that fans have come to expect over the years. Jim Henson may be gone but a new generation of writers and performers are doing right by his creations. The aforementioned Walter has grown up loving the Muppets as has his brother and best friend Gary (Jason Segel who also co-wrote the film). Gary takes his longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) to L.A. to celebrate their tenth anniversary and Walter tags along to see the sights -- not that there are many of those to behold at the decrepit Muppet Studios a moth-eaten shadow of its former self. Walter sneaks into Kermits old office and hears the ruthless Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) elaborate his plans to buy the studio and the theater under the guise of building a Muppet museum even though his real agenda is to tear it all down and dig for oil underneath. Horrified the small-town trio track down Kermit (voiced by Steve Whitmire) whos puttering around a moldering Bel-Air mansion nostalgic for the past. Walter inspires Kermit to reassemble the Muppets to hold a benefit telethon to save the theater sending them off to collect Fozzie Bear (voiced by Eric Jacobson) whos performing with a tribute act called ""The Moopets"" in Reno; Gonzo (voiced by Dave Goelz) now a successful plumbing-fixtures magnate; and all the rest. (In true Muppet fashion theres a montage of tracking down beloved characters -- and people in the movie mention the fact that theyre in a montage.) But there are challenges of course Can Kermit convince his estranged girlfriend Miss Piggy (Jacobson) to leave her gig as plus-size editor at French Vogue to return to the fold? Will the Muppets find a celebrity in Kermits 1970s Rolodex to host the telethon? And will Walter figure out what talents he might have in time for the show? The plot as you may well imagine is secondary to the barrage of jokes songs fourth-wall violations and occasional celebrity cameos that are part and parcel of the big-screen Muppet experience. And ""The Muppets"" gets all of this just right -- several of the new tunes are from ""Flight of the Conchords"" songwriter Bret McKenzie. (""Conchords"" vet James Bobin directs the new movie.) While Segel (who memorably worked singing puppets into ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and Adams are perfectly charming and totally get into the spirit of things can we take a moment to acknowledge what a great performer Kermit the Frog is? Hes got one of the most expressive skulls in show business (albeit also one of the softest ones) and he can convey a panoply of emotions just by indenting his temples or folding in his top lip. (All of the Muppets of course have that gift of smiling by opening their mouths as widely as possible.) There are one or two draggy moments in ""The Muppets"" but nothing that will render young audiences any more fidgety than say the ""Never Before and Never Again"" number in the original ""The Muppet Movie."" And for Muppet fans who like ""Star Wars"" nerds speak breathlessly of ""the original trilogy"" -- namely ""The Muppet Movie"" ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" -- this reboot stands proudly wackily and adorably with its storied predecessors. Even if Statler (Whitmire) and Waldorf (Goelz) are still heckling them. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Updated July 30 2016  253 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Close Animal in ""The Muppets"" (Disney) The Muppets Familiar faces brighten The Muppets BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Nov 22 2011 (...) Animal in ""The Muppets"" (Disney) This review of ""The Muppets"" is brought to you by the letter ""P.""""P"" stands for the puppets popularized by Jim Henson on the educational show ""Sesame Street"" the variety series ""The Muppet Show"" and a string of movies. ""P"" also stands for ""post-modernism"" a style of storytelling that never lets you forget that what youre watching is make-believe. The original ""Muppet Show"" with its complications behind the curtain and its grouchy geezers in the balcony was a relatively low-key example of post-modernism. ""The Muppets"" the troupes first film in more than a decade is a more aggressively absurd antidote to what it calls ""a hard cynical world."" Happily it works.One irony of this uncynical flick is that it was made by people who know what the word ""irony"" means. It stars and was co-written by Jason Segel who often plays a wisecracking stoner. But here he plays it straight as Gary the boyfriend of small-town schoolteacher Mary (Amy Adams) and brother of a little fellow named Walter (voice of Peter Linz) who happens to be a hand puppet. When Gary and Mary take a romantic trip to Hollywood they bring along Walter so he can tour the studio where his beloved Muppets made their TV show. But the studio is now an abandoned wreck and Walter overhears that millionaire Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) will drill for oil there unless the Muppets can come up with 10 million. So starry-eyed Walter rounds up the Muppets starting with Kermit the Frog who lives alone in a mansion decorated with 80s kitsch. Soon they recruit comedian Fozzie who is doing a Muppets-tribute show in Reno; drummer Animal who is undergoing anger management; and dozens more. Together with the humans and one particular piggy they plan a telethon to raise the money.There is plenty of music both on and off the stage but except for a lonesome-gals lament from Mary the songs by director James Bobin (""Flight of the Conchords"") arent memorable and Segel has an especially hard time faking the sincerity. The movies solution is to wink at the audience whenever possible. Were alerted when its time for a montage Gary quips that a spontaneous dance routine was exhausting and whenever the villain says something evil he adds the words ""maniacal laugh."" In different hands the gags could get annoying; but the familiar characters keep this puppet parade breezy. And there are moments when even an ironist might describe this fuzzy farce as deeply felt.

The Muppets Good to great Director James Bobin. Cast Amy Adams Jason Segel Chris Cooper. Rating PG for some mild rude humor. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Amy Adams That question is at the heart of ""The Muppets"" James Bobins film that was co-written by one of its stars Jason Segel and it is asked often. The answer is easy YES Absolutely smile-on-your-face song-in-your-heart yes. ""The Muppets"" is clever and current without being cynical smart without being condescending funny without being exclusionary to grown-ups or to kids. Its true that its basically a supersized episode of the old Muppets television show an updating of the previous Muppet movies. But its a delight. Interview Jason Segel talks The Muppets Gary (Segel) and Walter (voice of Peter Linz) are brothers despite Walter being a Muppet. Theyre also best friends hanging out together sleeping in twin beds in the same room. Walter is a Muppet fanatic (understandable) and Gary arranges to take his brother with him on a trip to Los Angeles even though its to celebrate his anniversary with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) a shop teacher. Its Garys dream to see the Muppets studios in Hollywood. But when they arrive the property is a broken-down mess. Walter sneaks into Kermits office and overhears the secret plans of oil magnate Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) to tear the studios down because there is oil beneath the buildings. The only hope to save it from destruction is to raise 10 million to buy the place. And that means getting the gang back together for one last show. Gary Walter and Mary stop first to see Kermit (Steve Whitmire). Years have passed since the Muppets have been together; is Kermit willing to reunite them? It takes a little convincing but he comes around. Soon Fozzie Bear (playing with Muppet tribute band the Moopets) Animal Rowlf and the rest are on board. Some visits come courtesy of a montage after a suggestion that it might save time. The characters break the fourth wall often in fact talking to the audience as when Mary says after Kermits initial refusal ""Wow this is going to be a short movie."" The most-difficult holdout is Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson) now editing Vogue Paris whose relationship with Kermit is ... complicated. The song-and-dance numbers are both sweet and funny which is an apt description of the whole movie. Segel who co-wrote the script with his ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" director Nicholas Stoller (Segel wrote that film as well) clearly loves the Muppets and hes done right by them. He and Adams dont fare quite as well; they quickly become supporting characters. There are several celebrity cameos youll have more fun discovering for yourself; watching the normally intense Cooper rap is a treat as well. And if you maybe tear up a little when Kermit sings a familiar number well um (cough) can we talk about something else? Lets talk about ""The Muppets"" instead because its worth it -- a treat for old fans of the characters and new ones alike.

"The Muppets Not easy being green |       NJ.com comments The Muppets Not easy being green Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 22 2011 at 800 AM updated November 23 2011 at 731 PM View/Post Comments Early in ""The Muppets"" two lifelong fans track down Kermit to beg him to reunite the old gang. They find him living like a recluse in a Bel-Air mansion filled with little but old memories. Which is sort of the state the entire Muppets franchise has found itself in lately. When Disney bought the brand purists worried theyd do terrible things with it. In fact the Mouse Factory did little with it. Distracted by the brand-new Pixar (which contributes a cute ""Toy Story"" cartoon here) they let the fuzzy veterans disappear in a fog of benign neglect. Until a very unlikely person -- Jason Segel (who yes did that bizarrely wonderful puppet show in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") had the idea to bring them back. The plot -- which owes more to the syndicated Muppet TV series than any of their movies -- has the plush-faced pals discovering that their once-grand studio and theater are up for sale. Can they put on a show and raise the 10 million to keep them going? Its a Mickey-and-Judy movie fantasy -- complete with a cameo from Mickey Rooney -- and lots of dancing in the streets. Do they succeed? Im not telling. Does Segel? Thats a far more complicated query. Segel (who also co-wrote the script) has not only revived the Muppets but tried to update them for a new audience. Its not always pleasant. The Muppets are family-film royalty. They dont need his fart jokes to get a laugh or quite so much (admittedly comic) violence. And his director -- a veteran of ""Flight of the Concords"" plus many Sacha Baron Cohen projects -- overplays the irony particularly with Segel and co-star Amy Adams who play innocent small-town lovers. Theyre constantly winking at the camera -- Im being corny on purpose get it? -- hoping in vain for us to wink back. Amy Adams is easier to take -- she has a pretty voice and gets to do a sort of I-will-survive disco number. (One of the less worked-out ideas in the film is that the Muppets are stuck in the 80s complete with dial-up modems and hair-band rock.) Segel though just seems emotionally and physically ungainly throughout -- like Laird Cregar in tap shoes. When the humans are offscreen though we can get back to our old friends and find out what theyve been up to. The tres elegante Miss Piggy for example is now the plus-size fashion editor for Paris Vogue. Fozzie is in a Muppets tribute band. Animal -- well Animal has issues. But theyre still all great fun (even if with Jim Henson gone and Frank Oz not participating not everyone sounds quite as they did at the beginning). And once ""Its time to play the music/Its time to light the lights"" and their own show gets going the smiles come bigger and faster. Yes its all not quite what it was -- but like Kermits mansion its been in need of some refurbishing for awhile. And while those of us who always loved the original can carp about the changes (They had to enclose that lovely porch? And slap on siding?) whats here is preferable to the empty lot it could have been. Ratings note The film contains some mildly rude humor and violence. The Muppets (PG) Disney (98 min.) Directed by James Bobin. With Jason Segel Amy Adams Miss Piggy Kermit.

"The Muppets movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Jason Segel and Disney host a Muppets reunion -- 3 starsNovember 22 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJason Segal and Amy Adams star in ""The Muppets.""A frisky new film showcasing some old pals made out of felt charm and some kind of genius the Disney release ""The Muppets"" overcomes a jaded streak reflecting its makers nervousness about selling Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy Fozzie Bear and the gang to an audience unfamiliar with ""Sesame Street"" (a Muppets chapter conspicuously left out of Disneys production notes) or ""The Muppet Show"" or the best of the earlier feature-length films ""The Great Muppet Caper"" being my favorite. Hence ""The Muppets"" deploys a bit of Nirvanas ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and a string of 80s jokes about Molly Ringwald and ""Benson.""The films naive sincere streak happily is wider than its subversive one. Its fun to spend time with these characters again. And in the nicest way the Muppets human co-stars Jason Segel and Amy Adams are sort of Muppety themselves especially when theyre wide-eyed and grinning.A clever idea holds this reboot together as simple as making one brother (Gary played by Segel) human and the other (Walter voiced by Peter Linz) a Muppet in love with the Muppets legacy. (He sports a Kermit wristwatch.) The locale is Smalltown USA which Gary and Walter introduce to us in the opening number ""Lifes a Happy Song."" Gary his schoolteacher sweetheart Mary (Adams) and Walter journey to Los Angeles for a vacation. Touring the old Muppet Studios facility the trio learn of the plan to raze the historically significant and sentimentally priceless structure. Theres oil under the ground see and the weaselly millionaire (Chris Cooper) after it doesnt give a Gonzos patoot about nostalgia.To preserve the old homestead the visitors must gather together the Muppets from various locales and raise 10 million in a save-the-Muppets telethon. Written by Segel and Nicholas Stoller and directed by ""Ali G"" and ""Flight of the Conchords"" alum James Bobin ""The Muppets"" positions its marquee nonhuman stars in a place of early 21st century cultural irrelevance. Over and over Kermit and others say things like ""People forgot about us."" One song lyric laments If we had ""another chance to entertain would anybody watch? Or even care?"" Coopers dastardly oilman sneers ""Youre relics Muppets. Youre dead"" Im a sensitive fellow I admit but a little of this bring-down goes a long way.At its best though ""The Muppets"" cuts back on the 80s-flashback self-consciousness and believes in the dream. By the time were treated to straightforward versions of ""Rainbow Connection"" (written for the first Muppet movie more than 30 years ago) and the fantastic end-credits ditty from further back ""Mah Na Mah Na"" those of us whove had Muppets in our memory since childhood will find ourselves in a state of contentment. Walter learns his true calling Gary learns to let go Mary learns that patience is indeed a virtue and Kermit and company reassert their worth as pop cultural giants. Also Rashida Jones playing a tightly wound TV executive proves her comic timing is as good as anyones on the scene these days human or Muppet.mjphillipstribune.comThe Muppets -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG (for some mild rude humor)Running time 150 (including ""Toy Story"" short ""Small Fry"")Opens Wednesday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesTina Fey The Muppets Stay in Character Even While Theyre...March 12 2014Film Review Muppets Most WantedMarch 12 2014Celine Dion and Miss Piggy Could Be Singing a Duet at Next...March 11 2014REVIEW Muppets Most Wanted March 20 2014Hensons early sketches of The Muppets up for auctionJuly 30 2012Find More Stories AboutJames BobinTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1121-muppets-20111121,0,1278525.column",200,themuppets34,themuppets,chicagotribune

Alas the banjo-playing personality with the perpetually youthful green complexion lost out to Billy Crystal. But the fan interest is proof of the durable popularity of the felt frog now starring in The Muppets the first big-screen reunion of the international-superstar puppet characters since their underwhelming 1999 outing Muppets in Space. As a theatrical troupe the Muppets havent exactly been AWOL these past dozen years; the gang rocked YouTube in 2009 with their kick-ass rendition of Queens ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" But theyve certainly been lying low while our twitchy tweet-y times have favored snarkier more air-quote-driven entertainment even from puppets. And in a way that showbiz hiatus has worked in favor of The Muppets. For adults the movies gentle clever unironic humor feels freshly trendily retro now enhanced by laughs provided in cameos from a very up-to-date roster of stars including Rashida Jones Jack Black Neil Patrick Harris Selena Gomez and Emily Blunt. And for kids blessedly unironic by nature until wised up by nurture the movie is just shiny funny and filled with songs including a curse-free chicken rendition of Cee-Los ""F-?-?- You."" Big goofily sincere Muppet fan Jason Segel (How I Met Your Mother) who co-wrote the script directed by Da Ali G Shows James Bobin stars as a nice guy named Gary whose happy life in Smalltown USA revolves around his longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams in her professionally adorable Enchanted comedian-sweetheart mode) and Garys pint-size brother Walter. Walters obsession with all things Muppet -- no surprise to everyone who looks at the felty guy and recognizes him as One of Them -- brings the trio to Los Angeles where they become involved in a desperate fund-raising plan to save the decrepit old Muppet Theater from the dastardly tear-down plans of an evil oilman (Chris Cooper a great meanie). In fact the story with its ""Lets put on a show"" vibe is a little wispy. (Thats the climax folks The Muppets resurrect The Muppet Show as a one-night telethon.) But the stuff surrounding the story is its own diversion. I like the look of the outdated run-down Muppet Studios when Walter takes a tour and indeed the run-down state of the Muppets themselves as Kermit begins pulling them out of retirement for an onstage reunion. I love the bits with a hint of Pee-wee Herman to them such as when Gary Mary and Walter travel in their car to France ""by map"" We watch a line arc across an atlas and the vehicle rises out of the water in Cannes. And Im delighted that The Devil Wears Pradas Emily Blunt shows up as a haughty British Vogue staffer attending to the whims of a very demanding editor Miss Piggy. Thats testament not to the power of Vogue -- but to the power of Muppets.

"The Muppets (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Muppets (PG) Kermit Miss Piggy Fozzie and the rest of Jim Hensons iconic creations are back better than ever. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/21/2011 Editor rating 3.5 There are two ways to approach The Muppets As a nostalgic throwback to the pop culture phenomenon of the 1970s and 80s or as an introduction to iconic characters whose popularity waned after the death of creator Jim Henson. Either way youll be delighted which is the biggest compliment you can pay this lively disarming movie. The Muppets may have been born out of a desire to revive a dormant franchise that was once a cash cow but there isnt a single beat in the film that feels crass or opportunistic. This one is from the heart. Or hearts rather. Director James Bobin (Da Ali G Show) and screenwriters Nicholas Stoller and Jason Segel (who also stars in the film) obviously adore Kermit Miss Piggy Fozzie Bear Animal and Gonzo; so do the rest of the famous faces (ranging in age from Mickey Rooney to Modern Familys Rico Rodriguez) that make cameos. The plot is ingenious allowing the filmmakers to take a meta-approach to the characters A greedy oil tycoon has bought the crumbling cobweb-ridden Muppet Studios in Hollywood and plans to demolish them. The Muppets have only a few days to raise 10 million and prevent their former home from demolition. But first Kermit must track down his former colleagues -- who have embarked on new careers -- and convince them to reunite. And what have the Muppets been up to since we saw them last? Fozzie is in Reno performing at a club with a Muppets cover band called The Moopets (theyre like sinister thugged-out versions of the Muppets). Miss Piggy is the Wintouresque editor of French Vogue. Gonzo has made a fortune in the toilet bowl industry. And just as the reunion bits start feeling repetitive someone tells Kermit ""May I suggest we pick up the rest of the Muppets using a montage?"" and the movie fast-forwards to the stuff you really want to see. That kind of cleverness extends to the song-and-dance numbers that dot the film. The Muppets is a bonafide musical that alternates between covers of contemporary pop hits (such as a hilarious rendition of Cee Lo Greens Forget You by Camilla and the Chickens) new versions of beloved Muppet classics (Rainbow Connection is a showstopper) and some fantastic new tunes - the catchiest wittiest original songs of any movie since South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut. Even Chris Cooper who plays the villain gets his own rap number. The Muppets gathers momentum and suspense as it heads towards its irresistible finale The movie gets better and funnier as it goes along and Segel and Amy Adams (playing a couple having relationship troubles) wisely cede the spotlight to their inanimate co-stars. The movies central question -- can these endearingly earnest characters still find an audience in todays cynical coarse world? -- is a great one serving as the engine that drives the plot and a commentary on pop culture. The answer I suspect will be a resounding yes. ""I guess people sort of forgot about us"" Kermit the Frog laments early on in The Muppets. This sparkling joyous movie should remedy that. Sometimes you can go home again. Cast Jason Segel Amy Adams Chris Cooper Rashida Jones Jack Black and many other surprise celebrities. Director James Bobin.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy Animal Fozzie Bear and the other Muppets havent been onscreen in ages. Their creator Jim Henson died in 1990. And Frank Oz the immortal voice of Piggy and Fozzie declined to participate. So the challenge Disney has with The Muppets is to show a new generation what the fuss was all about. Slam-dunk. Jason Segel the full-frontal star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall co-wrote the script with Get Him to the Greeks Nicholas Stoller. And thats James Bobin of HBOs Flight of the Conchords in the directors chair. R-rated talent with their hands up the Muppets? Whaaat Take a breath. The new movie never crosses its PG parameters. What it does enchantingly is to set a Muppet fan named Gary (Segel) on a journey from Smalltown USA to Hollywood to find out what happened to our felt friends. Gary brings along his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) and his brother Walter who looks like Gary in Muppet form. They need to stop an oil baron (Chris Cooper) from destroying the Muppet studios. Solution? Televise a Muppet reunion. The setup works like a charm. So do the songs with several new ones by Conchords star Bret McKenzie. Adams rocks out on ""Me Party."" And Segels heartfelt ballad ""Man or Muppet?"" deserves Academy attention as the movie song of the year. But its Kermie Piggy and the gang who rightly steal the show. The Muppets slaps a smile on your face you wont want to wipe off.

(fall preview/ the muppets/) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday July 3 2012 1226 AM Title The Muppets Film Info Kermit and the gang reunite. With Jason Segel Amy Adams. Director James Bobin (150). PG crude humor. It should be universally acknowledged that a world with Muppets is a better place in which to live. (If you disagree Im afraid there is no hope for you.) So we owe a great debt to superfan Jason Segel who has come as close as anyone to reviving the legacy of Jim Hensons ""Muppet Show."" Segel and Nicholas Stoller who made ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" together wrote the screenplay for ""The Muppets"" with obvious intent to return these icons to their former glory. If they cant quite attain that impossible goal they join director James Bobin in achieving an equally worthy aim reminding us what weve been missing. (The Muppets even outshine the ""Toy Story"" characters who appear in a cute pre-show short film.) Segel plays Gary who lives in Smalltown USA with his brother a puppet called Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) and his fiance a human named Mary (Amy Adams). When Gary and Walter learn a billionaire (Chris Cooper) plans to demolish the long-abandoned Muppet theater they resolve to reunite the gang and raise enough money to save the site. With Kermits help they track everyone down from Miss Piggy to Gonzo. But they still have to convince a skeptical executive (Rashida Jones) to air their telethon an extended episode of ""The Muppet Show."" And where will they find a guest host in time? There are rare visionaries who can never be replaced and Henson was among them. While the cast and crew do their best to honor his approach -- simultaneously open-hearted and edgy -- they never actually reach the heights of the original show or movie. That said this version is consistently funny and warm with just the right balance of silliness and sincerity -- though it also suffers from that 21st century curse excessive self-awareness. There are charming musical numbers delightful heroes and an appropriately hissable villain. And while we wont spoil any surprises some of the celebrity cameos are much better than others. So if Segels efforts arent quite sensational thats okay. Theyre still inspirational celebrational and -- most important -- Muppetational a concept thats been in sadly short supply as of late. So round up your family and buy your tickets. Its time to get things started.

E-mail| Print| Text size - + More than ever we need a world where a pig can be romantically linked to a frog. A world where no one finds it odd that Jason Segels little brother is a puppet and they share a room with twin beds as well as a taste for pastel leisure suits.""The Muppets"" marks a very welcome return for Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy and the rest of Jim Hensons creations after a 12-year big-screen absence. From start to finish the movie is a healthy dizzy dose of childlike bliss the songs campy but catchy the humor corny but clever the cast -- both human and Muppet -- one of the most lovable gangs youll ever spend time with at the pictures (another lovable gang the ""Toy Story"" playthings star in a short animated charmer that precedes ""The Muppets"").Sure the Muppets have long been a wholly owned subsidiary of big Hollywood namely the Walt Disney Co. But this is a gentle loving rebirth leaving intact the decency and goodness that have always been at the heart of the Muppets.The movies an exercise in innocent playfulness that largely side-steps show business as usual in which studio family flicks are stuffed to the rafters with glib pop-culture references and a soundtrack of tunes by flavor-of-the-month young idols. The Muppets are a world of their own -- you love or leave them on their terms -- and the filmmakers hold faithful to that whimsical little realm.The result is refreshing on every level a piece of nostalgia so old its new again and a breather from Hollywoods 3-D digital onslaught in favor of fur and fuzz.Lifelong ""Muppets"" fan Segel who co-wrote the movie with his ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" director Nicholas Stoller stars as Gary a small-town guy who heads with girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) for a dream trip to Hollywood. Tagging along is Garys brother Walter an endearing little puppet whos the worlds biggest fan of all things Muppet.Walters heartbroken to find that the Muppets studio in Hollywood has fallen into disrepair while Kermit his gal Piggy Fozzie Bear and the others have long since parted company. Overhearing an evil oil man (Chris Cooper) who schemes to raze the studio and drill for petroleum Walter enlists Gary and Mary to reunite the Muppets for a telethon to raise cash to buy the place back.In his big-screen debut director James Bobin (""Flight of the Conchords"") establishes a nimble pace from the start and maintains it right through the closing credits. The story gleefully dashes from song-and-dance numbers to hilarious montages to the sort of precious asides that are a staple of the Muppets among them plenty of self-aware winks and tweaks at Hollywood convention. The movie loads up on another Muppet strength the celebrity cameo (we wont name names though). Some of the surprise guests add good laughs; others seem to be there because they had a hole in their schedule or were pals with the filmmakers. The overall celebrity-guest quotient winds up disappointing. After such a long time in mothballs the Muppets deserve a better turnout of top stars to welcome them back.Wide-eyed with obvious reverence for the Muppets Segel and particularly Adams deliver nicely on some of the movies original songs which are cute little toe-tappers. And its worth the cost of a ticket just to see Academy Award winner Cooper -- usually playing men so restrained they look ready to burst from internal pressure -- cut loose with his own dastardly rap number.Classic Muppets tunes also are woven in and for anyone who grew up on ""The Muppet Show"" its a thrill -- yes thrill -- to see those floppy puppets dance about and sing their theme song.The filmmakers play the `80s flashback card heavily with well-chosen songs from the era and wisecracks about how dated the Muppets are. Thats good grist for parents but potentially a self-fulfilling prophecy for children who wouldnt be able to tell the Muppets from the movies amusing tribute band the Moopets.The plot parallels the real-world state of the Muppets -- relics testing the waters to see if anyone will watch if anyone still cares. That could be a genuine problem for the movie. Will kids who didnt grow up on Kermit and Piggy want to see it no matter how much Muppet-era parents hope their children might love these characters the way they did?Some parental guidance if the kiddies are reluctant tell them about the ""Toy Story"" short that plays first. No harm in letting todays No. 1 gang of fictional family stars shill for some deserving predecessors.""The Muppets"" a Disney release is rated PG for some mild rude humor. Running time 110 minutes including ""Toy Story"" short. Three stars out of four.------Motion Picture Association of America rating definitionsG -- General audiences.

Effortlessly blending wised-up self-reflexive humor with old-fashioned lets-put-on-a-show pizzazz ""The Muppets"" is an unexpected treat. Bright and perky cheeky but never mean-spirited the seventh Muppet-based theatrical feature finds Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy and friends emerging from semi-retirement to reclaim the spotlight just as Disney is banking (but not coasting) on the popularity of Jim Hensons puppet creations to win back an adoring moviegoing public. Charming musical elements a cluster of celebrity cameos and a thoroughgoing sense of creative resurgence engendered by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stollers smart script should ensure that happy outcome; hecklers will be few. Joining this years ""Winnie the Pooh"" as an example of a beloved Disney-owned property renewing itself without sullying tradition ""The Muppets"" is also the rare sequel conceived as a lovingly crafted tribute from one generation of comedic talent to another. After featuring a line of Henson puppets in their 2008 laffer ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" Stoller and Segel pitched the concept of a fresh Muppet movie (the first in the 12 years since the flop of ""Muppets From Space"") and Disney brought aboard British scribe-helmer James Bobin (""Flight of the Conchords"" ""Da Ali G Show"") to direct from the duos screenplay. Whatever one might have expected or feared from a group of funnymen known for their associations with Judd Apatow and Sacha Baron Cohen the creative team has somehow produced not only a vintage piece of Muppetry but one of the better screen musicals in recent memory. That much is clear from the sunny opening number ""Lifes a Happy Song"" a soft-shoe setpiece giddily headlined by Midwestern small-towner Gary (Segel) and his puppet pal Walter who has nursed a lifelong obsession with the Muppets. Gary and Walter have been like brothers since childdhood as seen in a growing-up montage that ends with the comical sight of the pint-sized puppet sharing a bedroom with the 64 Segel. When Gary and Mary (Amy Adams) his extremely patient g.f. of 10 years head to Los Angeles for a weeks vacation Walter tags along eager for the chance to visit Hollywoods historic Muppet Studios. But the Muppets have long since disbanded the studio lot has fallen into disrepair and as Walter conveniently learns the aptly named Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) is scheming to seize the property and drill for oil. Commenting on every cliche along the way Gary Mary and Walter drop in on Kermit then Fozzie Bear then Gonzo and Animal and so on setting plans in motion for a Muppets reunion telethon that will raise the dough needed to save their old home. The lone holdout is the ever-diva-like Miss Piggy now a Paris fashion-mag editrix still nursing hurt feelings over Kermits perpetual lack of romantic initiative. Similarly Mary increasingly resents that the Muppets are monopolizing her time with Gary while Walter experiences stage fright at the prospect of performing with his idols for the first time. From the cheery visual design (Rahel Afileys matching Gary-Walter costumes merit special mention) to the upbeat score and songs which include three fresh tunes by music supervisor Bret McKenzie (of ""Conchords"" fame) every aspect of the production radiates a sheen of clean-scrubbed optimism. Yet the marvel of ""The Muppets"" is how often it manages to express the most predictably earnest wide-eyed sentiments only to turn around and give them an irreverent poke without seeming in any way insincere. If the we-know-were-in-a-movie winking goes a bit overboard the pic fosters considerable goodwill by having much of it delivered by Segel and Adams. (When a seemingly dead-end plot twist causes Mary to squeal ""This is going to be a really short movie"" it helps to have an actress as wholesome yet self-aware as Adams selling the line.) With their features and bodies possessed of a positively Muppet-like elasticity the thesps couldnt be more in tune with the silly sensibility at play here or more game for song-and-dance duty. Still the strangest musical perf comes courtesy of Cooper busting out a rap so surreally unmotivated that the bouncy-ball subtitles seem designed to facilitate viewer comprehension rather than to get anyone to actually sing along. Roster of supporting thesps includes Rashida Jones Emily Blunt Sarah Silverman and Zach Galifianakis while James Carville Whoopi Goldberg Selena Gomez Neil Patrick Harris and most hilariously an unbilled Jack Black all pop up briefly as themselves. But the human players never overpower the work of multitasking Muppeteers Steve Whitmire Eric Jacobson Dave Goelz Bill Barretta David Rudman Matt Vogel and Peter Linz whose endearing performances deserve no small credit for this enjoyable throwback. Preceding the film in theaters is Pixars latest ""Toy Story"" short ""Small Fry"" which slyly sends up the fast-food industry with an amusing examination of toy abandonment issues.

Daily Edition Login to download The Muppets Film Review 901 PM PST 11/17/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Scott Garfield/Disney Enterprises A mostly winning return for childhood favorites from a prior century looks to accomplish its goal of pleasing old fans and winning new ones. TWITTER Jim Hensons cultural mainstays return to the big screen for the first time since 1999 in the James Bobin-directed musical comedy. ""In this market you guys are no longer relevant"" Rashida Jones TV executive bluntly explains to a bunch of puppets hoping to make their showbiz comeback but the veteran entertainers endeavor to prove her wrong in The Muppets. The first bigscreen outing for the colorful crew since Muppets from Space in 1999 and since Disney acquired the franchise from the Jim Henson estate in 2004 this perfectly enjoyable family comedy is disarmingly upfront about its raison detre--to reboot the Muppets for a new generation of moppets. In this it should succeed while also entertaining old fans inclined to a bit of childhood nostalgia. PHOTOS The Muppets Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals A comic actor more identified with raunchy humor Jason Segel has played a major hand in breathing new life into these 1970s-90s cultural mainstays co-writing co-executive producing and starring in this zippy feature that is about nothing more or less than the effort of bringing the long-since dispersed Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy Fozzie Bear Gonzo Animal and all the rest back together again. It does so with good cheer a frank acknowledgment of changing mores and time passed and a wink at its own squeaky clean silliness. In fact the most clueless characters here are not the Muppets who have moved on to other pursuits with varying degrees of success but the two would-be grownups Gary (Segel) and Mary (Amy Adams) naive goody-goodies who have been going together for nearly ten years and live in Smalltown U.S.A. which bears more than a passing resemblance to Disneylands Main Street. The stumbling blocks to matrimony are Garys thoroughgoing immaturity and his related lifelong palship with Walter a muppet who has always dreamed of jumping into the TV set to join his fellow relations. Human dishrag Gary no doubt wouldnt mind doing the same but instead the two guys and a girl settle on the next best thing a trip on a 1950s vintage Greyhound to Los Angeles to visit the Muppet Studios. VIDEO The Muppets Jason Segel On Future of the Film Franchise Alas the facility (in the movies world located in a dilapidated rendition of Disneys Hollywood Boulevard flagship El Capitan Theater) has shuttered although a tired old guide (Alan Arkin) offers a tour of what remains (""Is this the Universal Studios?"" a befuddled Asian tourist inquires). But sneaking into Kermit the Frogs old office Walter learns that evil real estate tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) will seize control of the whole operation unless 10 million can be raised to retain Muppet ownership. So when in doubt or need what do show folk do? Put on a show of course. Finding Kermit in of all places Bel-Air the intrepid group then traverses half the planet tracking down the other key players. On one end of the spectrum they find Fozzie Bear entertaining at a barrel-bottom lounge in Reno while by contrast Miss Piggy now reigns over a top fashion magazine in Paris (with Emily Blunt no less as her assistant) and is understandably reluctant to chuck it all for a reunion of dubious worth. But when a TV network desperately needs to fill a slot the gang suddenly has but two days to pull together its fund raising special before Tex can move in replace the originals with his own ""Moopets."" Things bog down when the neglected Mary pouts over Garys preference for the Muppets company although this does result in his pretty funny mock-introspective song bearing the essential refrain ""Am I a man or a Muppet?"" STORY Kermit as Mogul Farting Fozzie Bear How Disneys Muppets Movie Has Purists Rattled While the answer to that question remains unclear due to the immutable rag doll nature of Segels limp leading man the actual cloth creatures rise to the occasion splendidly kidnapping an unbilled Jack Black to be their unwilling star headliner and putting on a show of which Mickey Rooney himself (who does a quick cameo early on) could be proud. For that matter a good many others (Zach Galifianakis Selena Gomez Whoopi Goldberg Neil Patrick Harris Sarah Silverman) also support the cause by showing their faces for a moment or two leading up to a climactic musical on Hollywood Boulevard thats more than a tad self-congratulatory. While the script he wrote with Nicholas Stoller nicely serves its purpose Segel does neither himself and nor his costar Adams any favors with the infantile characters they portray; his Gary is a lumpen bumpkin whose development was arrested at no later than age nine while the normally wonderful Adams has never been so ill-served by any movie role since her big breakthrough in Disneys own Enchanted in 2007; literally taking a back seat to Muppets during the road trip shes the ultimate tag-along never allowed to assert herself and instead forced to patiently and silently endure the obsessions of Gary and the fuzzy ones who rightly continue to be played by real puppets and not by some newfangled technological rendition of them. Still a breezy keen-to-please attitudes prevails and director James Bobin (The Flight of the Conchords Da Ali G Show for TV) moves things along with good cheer; at one point when the search for stray critters begins to wear down one says ""May I suggest we save time and pick up the rest of the Muppets in a montage?"" Its duly done. An entirely superfluous shot of the teams old Rolls-Royce emerging from the sea onto the beach in Cannes will vastly amuse anyone whos ever been to the film festival there. The Muppets will be preceded at least initially by a new eight-minute Toy Story short in which the neglected toys engage in very amusing group therapy.
