Disney/Pixar hide caption toggle caption Disney/Pixar Linguini (the redhead) and Remy (the furry gray one) plot a kitchen conquest in Ratatouille. Disney/Pixar Director Brad BirdGenre Comedy AnimationRunning Time 110 minutes (requires RealPlayer) Faaaabulous Pixar pics were the rule until Cars crashed into multiplexes last year. The mix was wrong in that one -- lots of digital vim not enough emotional vigor. But the studios animators have got the recipe right this time in a tale of mistaken identity haute cuisine and rambunctious rodents. The story concerns Remy a Parisian rat (voiced by Patton Oswalt) who dreams of culinary glory working as a fine French chef but who needs a front man who wont cause screams in the kitchen. He finds one in Linguini (Lou Romano) a garbage boy with no noticeable gustatory talent whos willing to play puppet to Remys puppeteer in order to keep his job -- and incidentally to pursue a pretty sous-chef (Janeane Garofalo). You expect kitchen slapstick; you get something thats closer to kitchen ballet with food so lovingly digitized you can tell stale bread from fresh. More than that You get a story with real sturm und drang and a lot of heart. Its Cyrano de Bergerat and its not just amusing its downright enchanting from its faintly harrowing rat swarms (Remys family drops by his workplace on occasion) to its hilariously demanding food critic Anton Ego (Peter OToole). Kids will gobble it up while parents relish its wit -- and everyone will want to go out to eat afterward.

The films main protagonist however is Remy (Patton Oswalt) a rat with a gourmet palate and the artistic ambition to create new recipes for the world in the hallowed tradition of gourmet legend Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett) who has just died from grief over a bad review by the aforementioned Anton Ego. Remy chooses as the human practitioners of his genius a hapless kitchen helper named Linguini (Lou Romano) and his acid-tongued eventual sweetheart of a cook Colette (Janeane Garofalo). Remy faces two major obstacles in his career path the first from his father and the rest of the noncutesy-drawn rodents who fervently believe that garbage is the most tasteful and nutritious food there is and the second from Gusteaus venal successor Skinner (Ian Holm) who shamefully wants to make money by marketing fast-food recipes. It is a long hard fight for Remy but he prevails in the end with the soulful acquiescence of the converted food critic Anton Ego. In short Ratatouille is a veritable feast for the eye and the ear.

By David Denby Nikki Blonsky and John Travolta as Tracy and Edna Turnblad.   Credit JONAS BERGSTRAND The movie version of the hit Broadway musical ""Hairspray"" is perfectly pleasant--I smiled to myself all the way through it--but its not as exhilarating as the show. For a subject like this--old dance crazes and pop styles--what matters is not so much the actual past but how we feel about it and onstage David Rockwells sets and William Ivey Longs costumes distilled our nostalgia for the candied years between Elviss early work and the arrival of the Beatles. Set in 1962 ""Hairspray"" whose first incarnation was John Waterss deadpan camp movie from 1988 celebrates a time when teen-agers as a distinct consumer group with their own culture were a fairly recent invention. The stage musical crystallized the euphoria of that period as naively eager commerce and irony-free fantasy; when the chubby young heroine Tracy Turnblad awoke in bed and sang ""Good Morning Baltimore"" she was surrounded by a pink shag carpet dotted with hair-spray cans and 45s and the bouffant-and-beehive nuttiness of her world was buoyed by affection. The movie is a lovefest too but this time when Tracy (Nikki Blonsky) awakes she jumps onto the streets of Baltimore and passes vermin a drunk and a creep. Later she joins a civil-rights march that has a confrontation with the police. Many people love movies because they make sensuous contact with the surfaces of the world but this material hardly cries out for realism. ""Hairspray"" doesnt need to be ""opened up""; it needs to be freshly stylized for the screen. That hasnt quite happened. The director Adam Shankman who has made comedies and family films and the screenwriter Leslie Dixon have removed the traces of weird humor and Broadway blue that gave the show its happily knowing flavor. I admire John Travolta but using this movie star rather than the shows Harvey Fierstein as Edna Turnblad Tracys hefty mother is an idiocy on the same level as replacing Julie Andrews with Audrey Hepburn for the movie version of ""My Fair Lady."" Both Fierstein and Divine who played Edna in the original movie worked as female impersonators who confidently let us in on the joke. In the show when Fierstein held forth on life and love and the Gabor sisters in his basso absurdo--a testosterone-drenched Bensonhurst snarl--he was not a man pretending to be a woman; he was a man openly playing a woman and speaking in his own voice. But Travolta does a wistful imitation of the female sex. Buried in a full-body fat suit and various silicone prosthetic appliances he looks rounded smooth and cute rather like Miss Piggy and he speaks in a light high female voice--he sounds a little like Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" without the lilt. The role demands exaggeration rather than modesty yet Travolta with a misbegotten sense of duty tries to give an authentic performance as a working-class Baltimore housewife of forty-five years ago--a shy guarded woman who is embarrassed about her weight. Its a touching attempt but the lunatic joke that started with Divine has almost vanished. The rest of ""Hairspray"" is less delicate and self-conscious. As before Tracy lives to dance and to make out with the sweet good-looking boy (Zac Efron) whos the high-school king. ""Hairspray"" is geared to her energy and her triumph. At the local afternoon-TV dance show she bursts through the ban on fat girls frustrating the designs of the hypocritical racist station manager Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants her own untalented daughter to become Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962. Pfeiffer plays this vaudeville bitch to the hilt. Her Velma however is not a very formidable villain and everyone else helps Tracys dreams come true including the shows slick m.c. Corny Collins (James Marsden) and the lead performer on the shows monthly Negro Day Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah). At school Tracy falls in with the black kids who admire her spirit and show her how to really dance. When Negro Day is booted off the schedule Tracy goes to the black side of town joins forces with her friends there and fights to integrate the station. (The protesters show up with signs saying ""Do the Checkerboard."") In an amiably sappy way ""Hairspray"" is offering a racial fable blacks teach whites how to move liberating their bodies and whites help blacks gain their rights. Its hard to take this message-movie stuff even half seriously Shankman seems to think he has something important to say but Marc Shaimans music (including a few new songs) with its homogenized Broadway sound is not memorable enough to serve as a vehicle of political thought--or even genial political fantasy. The rest is dance. The kids hold an endless platter party in the TV studio school corridors and classrooms and its a relief to see their bodies whole and not chopped into churning limbs in the Baz Luhrmann (""Moulin Rouge"") or Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") manner. But the routines unfortunately are nothing special--worked-up versions of popular dances of the time with groups of girls in cone skirts and boys in cardigans and string ties dancing in rows and the camera for the most part plopped down right in front of them. Shankman could use a little liberating himself with few exceptions he uses the camera stiffly; he doesnt give us the concentrated essence of pop whimsy that we want. The finest moment is something very simple and straightforward Christopher Walken playing Tracys father Wilbur Turnblad coarsens his voice and gentles his manner and woos Edna with the lovely Old Broadway-style song ""Youre Timeless to Me."" The number begins in the Turnblad living room works its way down the back stairs and concludes in the yard amid hanging laundry. In the end Shankman may feel a greater kinship with the old folks than with the pulsing kids. ""Theres something about humans"" muses Remy (Patton Oswalt) the French country rat who is the hero of the animated gastronomic marvel ""Ratatouille."" He goes on ""They taste. . . . They discover."" What Remy doesnt say though its implicit in his attitude is that humans and rats are brothers under the fur they alone among all Gods creatures eat everything. But Remy has his own version of the omnivores dilemma hes afflicted with a refined palate. Refusing the usual repast of garbage he realizes that in order to eat well he needs to cook. ""Ratatouille"" starts out as a minor conceit about a rat who turns himself into a connoisseur and becomes a gripping comic tale about the implacability of an artist. Washed into a sewer Remy lands in Paris and makes himself known to a young man Linguini (Lou Romano) who has inherited a famous restaurant but cannot so much as crack an egg. Quietly he rides under Linguinis toque and pulls tufts of his hair controlling his chopping and sauce-stirring techniques like a master puppeteer. A menacing challenge lies ahead a visit from the annihilating restaurant critic Anton Ego (Peter OToole). The animation gang at Pixar dont settle for goosing old fairy tales and shining up media-weary jokes as the DreamWorks folks do in the ""Shrek"" series. They create each movie afresh and some of their productions especially this one and ""The Incredibles"" both written and directed by Brad Bird have reached heights of invention speed and wit not seen in animation since the work done by Chuck Jones at Warner Bros. in the nineteen-forties. In ""Ratatouille"" the level of moment-by-moment craftsmanship is a wonder. Keeping the space clear and coherent may seem an odd thing to praise in an animated film but one of the marvellous things about ""Ratatouille"" is how well we come to understand the geography of the kitchen in which much of the movie takes place. The point of view jumps to the top of cabinets and scampers beneath ovens and counters but we always know where we are in relation to the rest of the kitchen and why it matters where Remy goes or doesnt go. When he calls in his family and friends to help out in a crisis the animals who need to be sanitized emerge from a dishwasher in a puff of steam and get assigned to their stations as sauciers sous-chefs and the like where they crawl up ladles to the rims of soup tureens and send mushrooms cascading into a waiting boeuf en daube. Our knowledge of the kitchen makes the rapid-fire gags much funnier. Bird has turned disgust into a celebration of efficiency and on the fly he offers the most detailed cooking lore and the most ardent celebration of the chef as artist since ""Babettes Feast."" Toques off to Mr. Bird. At a time when many Americans have so misunderstood the ethos of democracy that they hate being outclassed by anyone when science is disdained as dangerous and expertise as elitism this animation artist working in a family medium has made two brilliant movies that unequivocally champion excellence. ""Ratatouille"" suggests that some omnivores are better than others. Theres nothing to do but get over it.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Disney Movies Entertainment News One of the great pleasures of Brad Birds ""Ratatouille"" -- just one of many in a picture that is itself about the rewards and the frustrations of seeking pleasure -- is its inherent lightness the way it seems wholly unaware that its a grand achievement of animation even though it is. Bird is one of the great modern animators -- as well as an astonishingly gifted filmmaker period -- precisely because he doesnt set out to wow us. His colors are never garish; his characters are always written fleshed out not just storyboarded; and his ideas while easy enough to grasp stretch beyond the typical homilies of being true to oneself or of asserting that everyone is special. In fact Birds pictures -- which include the gentle but assertive 1999 Cold War fable ""The Iron Giant"" and the 2004 superhero adventure ""The Incredibles"" a movie about families and the nature of democracy -- honor and celebrate individuality even as they recognize that the development of potential (and not just mindless praise of the raw unshaped material in all of us) is whats important. Each of us has a specific set of gifts but recognizing them isnt enough; its what we do with them that counts. And so with the Disney/Pixar ""Ratatouille"" Bird gives us the most distasteful setup imaginable -- rats in the kitchen not only touching the food but preparing it -- and turns it around into something we couldnt have expected. Remy (his voice is that of comedian Patton Oswalt) is a French rat with a highly attuned sense of taste and smell such that his father Django (Brian Dennehy) and his large network of rat friends and family put him to work sniffing around for hidden rat poison. Remy knows that as a rat its his lot in life to scrounge and to steal. Still hes a rat with a dream He wants to become a chef to be the creator of something not merely a thief or hanger-on. Remys idol is a jolly rotund celebrity chef named Gusteau (Brad Garrett) whose dictum is ""Anyone can cook."" At least that was his dictum Gusteau whose heart was broken over a bad review by spiteful food critic Anton Ego (a deliciously nasty Peter OToole) which resulted in the loss of one of his restaurants stars has passed on to that great kitchen in the sky. But he hasnt left this earth altogether. A cheerful vaporous mentor rising from the pages of one of his own cookbooks he appears to Remy to guide and inspire this sincere and intelligent little rat. Remy finds his way into the kitchen of the once-great chefs Paris restaurant -- which is now being run by a greedy self-serving operator named Skinner (Ian Holm) -- and forges a tentative tempestuous kinship with its skinny lackadaisical garbage boy Alfredo Linguini (Lou Romano) who will help him do the work of turning his dreams into reality. ""Ratatouille"" is a practical-minded picture a story thats less about dreams than it is about work. But its also about the delight that work done well can bring. Bird captures the heady chaos of working in a kitchen the edgy adrenaline-fueled ballet in which a handful of players avoid one another and help one another as each keeps a hand in a dozen things at once. Bird shows us arms and legs dashing by in a blur onions being chopped with surgeonly precision the contents of frypans being tended as if they were great art instead of just dollops of eggs and cream. (Even if youve never worked in a restaurant yourself youll recognize the authenticity of the setting if youve read Anthony Bourdains ""Kitchen Confidential""; Bourdain gets a thank-you credit on the film.) The kitchen of ""Ratatouille"" is also incidentally a racially diverse one This may be a cartoon Paris but it doesnt exist completely in a cartoon world. In an early scene the ghost of Gusteau takes Remy on a tour of the restaurant kitchen asking him to name all the players and their functions. When Gusteau gets to the lowly gangly helper Alfredo Remy says ""Oh thats nobody."" Gusteau quickly corrects him -- ""He is not nobody. He is a part of the kitchen"" -- and from that simple statement the ultimate meaning of ""Ratatouille"" begins to unfold. In Brad Birds world everyone has a role to play. As one character will intimate later not everyone can be a great artist. But great art can come from anyone or from anywhere. You Might Also Like But it may be doing ""Ratatouille"" a disservice to talk about its intentions and meanings before stating outright that the picture is pure joy. I admit that I generally prefer short-form animation -- the perfect miniatures of Chuck Jones Max Fleischer and Walt Disney -- to full-length features. I also prefer traditional 2-D animation to the computer-generated kind. But CG or not ""Ratatouille"" is one of the most beautiful animated pictures Ive ever seen Ill even put it up against what is for me the gold standard Walt Disneys luminous 1937 ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."" Birds palette is soft but vibrant and he favors rounded gently shadowed shapes. In stark contrast to the aggressive hyperrealism of so much computer animation his figures seem to breathe and even when the action is lively its never manic. His character design itself is a form of stealth If you dont much care for rats -- and face it how many of us do? -- you may feel a twinge of repulsion when you first see Remys translucent pink bulb of a nose his little pink hands peeking out from sleeves of gray fur. But hes so expressive so matter-of-fact about his inescapable ratness that its easy to fall for him. The shambling sleepy-eyed red-headed Alfredo with his giant schnozz and mile-long legs resembles a young Pete Townshend. Bird also gives us a sharp-edged and very French female character in Colette (Janeane Garofalo) an ambitious but experienced kitchen hand who eventually softens toward the inept Alfredo. With her almond eyes and businesslike bob shes like a sexually alluring but no less confident version of Edna E. Mode. Remy is alternately impatient with and tolerant of Alfredos slacker-kid helplessness and their friendship -- which blossoms around the art of cooking -- feels all the more genuine because it doesnt immediately ignite. But even though the story trots along at a healthy clip -- despite its 110-minute length ""Ratatouille"" is never dull -- whats most wonderful about it is the way Bird layers so many lovely details. Remy doesnt just pop grapes into his mouth; he drains each one until its the shape of a tiny wineglass savoring every drop. When Remy first spends the night in Alfredos Paris apartment -- its a small but cozy garret overlooking the Eiffel Tower a resplendent contrast of physical poverty and visual egalitarian richness -- he sleeps in an oven mitt thats been set on the windowsill. The lair of the nasty critic Ego is a comic-nightmare vision straight out of Charles Addams a coffin-shaped study that suggests nothing so much as a man shut off from the world. Near the end of the picture Ego has a speech that begins with a statement about the uselessness of critics about the way they live for the experience of slapping things down instead of creating anything worthwhile themselves. The speech winds its way around to a more complicated revelation about the importance of finding beauty and wonder in unexpected corners of our world. Still I suspect many professional critics will take Egos speech as a slap on the wrist and people who hate critics -- you know who you are -- will feel theyve received some juicy vindication. But for me -- a person who writes about movies but doesnt make them -- Egos speech rings completely true and I cant read it as Birds way of cutting down critics of painting them as evil creatures who must be reformed. If anything I wonder if he doesnt feel a kinship with them. Criticism done right isnt about destruction; its about the pursuit of pleasure and delight and surprise the seeking of both sensation and meaning and sharing it with as many people as you can. At the end of ""Ratatouille"" I felt nothing but gratitude for the joy that Bird and his very large team -- doing work that I know is painstaking time-consuming and extremely difficult -- were able to give me. Sitting down at the keyboard later to work out the meaning of that pleasure is my job. But the deep happiness I got from the movie itself is still my truest reward. Id gotten the last bit of juice from every grape and I couldnt ask for more. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

"Ratatouille A Classic Recipe washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Ratatouille A Classic Recipe Remy the rat an aspiring chef gets his chance in a fancy French restaurant by teaming with klutzy kitchen boy Linguini (Lou Romano). (Disney Enterprises And Pixar Animation Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 29 2007 Rats -- according to a recent poll that I just made up -- edge out cockroaches and lawyers as the most reviled species known to humankind. But thanks to the charming computer-animated ""Ratatouille"" their front-runner status may be in serious jeopardy. Written and directed by Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"") the movie makes us reassess those pests as more than misunderstood fuzzballs just hunting for their next meal. One of them -- a plucky adorable nibbler by the name of Remy -- aspires to be the top chef in a prestigious Parisian restaurant. Hey why should haute cuisine remain the exclusive domain of humans? Any rodent with the right combination of determination and spices should have the right to become the rodent bleu of his generation. If that isnt a feel-good message for everyone -- with the possible exception of the French culinary establishment -- what is? A co-production of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios the brilliant production house that also gave us ""The Incredibles"" and ""Toy Story"" ""Ratatouille"" has that so-real-you-can-touch-it quality with characters that seem more like tactile puppets than two-dimensional beings. But unlike its CGI predecessors ""Ratatouille"" doesnt center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disneys older era -- when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters. As with such Disney classics as ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""The Rescuers"" the animals here are softly appealing the repartee is bright but not postmodern and the irony is easily understood. You can feel an almost antique atmosphere in the elegantly stylized renderings of alleys cobbled streets and restaurants in the background. This is family-friendly filmmaking at its most appealing -- fresh yet familiar playfully mischievous but also subtly reassuring. Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) has a gourmets sense of taste and smell a skill set that means nothing to his fellow scavengers. When he becomes fixated with the writings and philosophy of the celebrated master chef Gusteau author of ""Anyone Can Cook"" his heart swells with grand purpose. Through an entertaining series of calamities -- which include floating through the sewers of Paris on Gusteaus best-selling hardcover -- Remy literally lands in Gusteaus kitchen. There he helps a gangly kitchen boy named Linguini (a charmingly goofy Lou Romano) transform a gastronomical disaster into a tasty masterpiece. Linguini who gets all the credit for the hot new recipe begs Remy to help him repeat the success. So Remy hides inside Linguinis white hat (dont want to scare people) and directs the boy -- ""Pinocchio"" style -- with strategic tugs of Linguinis hair. The two become a formidable team and their impressive cuisine does not go unnoticed by the arrogant food critic Anton Ego. As voiced by veteran actor Peter OToole Ego is a wonderfully dour self-absorbed prig who declares of his daily regimen ""I dont like food I love it. And if I dont love it I dont swallow."" ""Ratatouille"" goes down so smoothly its easy to forget its passing details. Observed mostly from Remys rats-eye view Gusteaus kitchen is a memorable world-in-miniature with its vivid old-fashioned stoves bright brassy pots and general air of frenzied industry; never did sliced red onions or simmering soup look so fresh and real. And theres a showstopper scene in which a granny -- her head covered in pink curlers -- chases Remy around her kitchen with a shotgun. (Although she peppers her walls and ceiling with pellets the scene is no scarier than an Elmer Fudd shooting spree.) Michael Giacchinos beautifully modulated score evokes the French movie soundtracks of the late 1950s and early 1960s when jazz and pop blended together in a hip almost cheesy frenzy. And he conveys the more cliched musical themes associated with Paris -- accordions and such -- with witty originality. With such a public relations triumph for the rats of the world the mind goes to racing to other vilified creatures in the animal kingdom. Might we expect a major comeback for a very famous vermin from the old Disney vaults? Pepe Le Pew Line 1. ""Ratatouille"" is preceded by ""Lifted"" a Pixar short in which an extremely nervous young alien tries -- with much slapstick bumbling -- to pass his human abduction and spaceship driving test making for the funniest five minutes thus far of the summer.

"Feast your eyes | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsFeast your eyesPixar cooks up an instant classic with this animation about a rat who would be a chef. Read Peter Howells review and watch the trailer.Remy the rat dreams of culinary glory in a Paris kitchen in Ratatouille.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 29 2007 Ratatouille (out of 4)An animated comedy featuring the voices of Patton Oswalt Ian Holm Brian Dennehy Peter OToole Brad Garrett and Janeane Garofalo. Written and directed by Brad Bird. At major theatres. 110 minutes. GYou might well say that the thought of a sewer rat preparing a gourmet meal is the opposite of appetizing. Ratatouille makes you eat your words. This latest and greatest Pixar animation not only turns the distasteful to tasty it teaches you something about fine cuisine.And what a treat it is in this summer of reheated sequels and artificial flavours. Let Spidey Jack and Shrek dish up their usual fare; Im ordering the exotic offerings of Remy the rat. Hes the blue-tinted rodent voiced with gusto by comedian Patton Oswalt whose subterranean savourings beneath the cobblestones of Paris come to fruition in a restaurant of fine cuisine.Not just any restaurant but the kitchen of fabled chef Auguste Gusteau whose popular tome Anyone Can Cook has inspired Remy to dream big. Alas Gusteaus big heart was permanently stilled by the pen of food critic Anton Ego (Peter OToole) who cruelly robbed Gusteaus the resto named for the man of a crucial star rating. Remys dad Django (Brian Dennehy) scolds his son to ""Shut up and eat your garbage"" like a good rat should. But Remy is blessed (cursed?) with a sniffer that twitches only at fresh cheese herbs spices and other gustatorial delights. He prefers his meals served on china plates rather than trash can lids. He knows how to cook - and cook well - even if he has to hold the wooden spoon with both paws.Gusteaus restaurant is not only above Remys head but above his station. Humans dont want anything furry near food least of all in a kitchen ruthlessly ruled by head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) who knows a lot about being a dirty rat.Fortunately Remy has an ally in bumbling recruit Linguini (Lou Romano) tasked with washing dishes and throwing out refuse. They find common purpose in a shared dream with Remys nose and Linguinis hands they can prove the magic of Gusteaus egalitarian motto. It helps that the spirit of Gusteau (Brad Garrett) hovers over the proceedings to provide inspiration and that assistant cook Collette (Janeane Garofalo) has something simmering with Linguini.The most amusing thing about Ratatouille is the idea that a French chef preaching democratic dining is harder to swallow than a rat manning the chopping block. But writer/director Brad Bird loves to sautee stereotypes - remember his flabby action hero in The Incredibles his previous Pixar winner?Bird had his work cut out for him this time. It is perverse in the extreme to create a cartoon about a rat working with food. He could have made Remy a sweet little bunny rabbit or even a hamster and not risk triggering our gag reflexes. (One nice touch Remy and his rat buddies all wash their hands before handling food.)Had Bird gone the safe route he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy who like the rest of the film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like. Its also my pick for Pixars best especially after the disappointment of Cars last year.Bird isnt content to just delight; he also seeks to enlighten. Ratatouille is chock full of information about how a kitchen is run such as Collettes instructions about how best to handle multiple saucepans ""The mark of a chef messy aprons and clean sleeves.""And heres the mark of a classic film youll want second third or more helpings of Ratatouille.

AND PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS          ""Ratatouille"" is the story of a rat that loves to cook and gets his chance by teaming with the klutzy human garbage boy in the kitchen of a fancy French restaurant. Its the latest effort from Brad Bird the filmmaker behind the Academy Award-winning ""The Incredibles."" How good and how much fun is ""Ratatouille""? So good that when it was over all I wanted to do was watch it again. And how rare is this experience in this summer of bloated sequels? Rarer than lets say a rat who loves to cook -- and a screenwriter who knows how to transform a potentially unappealing tidbit of a story (A rodent? Around food?) into a feast. The wizards at Pixar working with writer/director Brad Bird (they previously teamed up for the equally stellar ""The Incredibles"") have once again delivered a technically impeccable film with humor and heart -- and with surely Frances most hygienic rat Remy at its center. Winningly voiced by Patton Oswalt Remy has a familiar Disney dilemma He has a wistful dream that seems impossible. Like a puppet who wants to be a boy or a mermaid who wants to walk on land his goal is intimidatingly remote Hes a rat who wants to be a chef in a world-class Paris restaurant. Remy has you see a refined palate; hes a creature disgusted by the garbage his fellow rodents devour and a moralist bothered by the fact that the garbage isnt really theirs to take. ""It isnt stealing if no one wants it"" advises his father between bites. ""If no one wants it"" counters Remy ""why do we steal it?"" Bored with his swill-swigging rat pack Remy has a secret life sneaking into kitchens and watching his hero Chef Auguste Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett) on television cooking shows. One day a cuisine-related crisis causes panic evacuation Remys inadvertent separation from his gang and his subsequent arrival (via sewer) at Gusteaus five-star Paris restaurant. His journey from sewer rat (though one thats scrupulous about handwashing) to celebrity chef with help from a skinny garbage boy named Linguini (Lou Romano) is the movies unlikely arc told with affection charm and plenty of good cooking. (You wish the movie included recipes.) Its no surprise that like all of Pixars movies this one looks breathtaking but the expressions on the animated characters seem even more nuanced this time around. Remy his fur glowing a bluish-gray (he looks a bit like a rat version of Grover from ""Sesame Street"") can talk with his eyes He can look ashamed triumphant tentative disappointed panicked and ultimately very happy and we go through the emotions with him. Likewise the human characters have memorable trademarks. Gusteau mostly seen as a dream figure has no neck just cheeks that slide all the way down to his shoulders. Linguini has fiery red hair and a chin so pointed it could slice bread. His nemesis in the kitchen Chef Skinner (Ian Holm) sports a nasty comb-over and a thin John Waters mustache. And Anton Ego (Peter OToole) a food critic known as the Grim Eater has the spindly vampire-with-glasses look of a Tim Burton character -- which makes it all the more rewarding when he too reveals his heart. Witty precise details abound throughout ""Ratatouille"" such as the oven mitt in which Remy sleeps and the way a chef describes a great crust as ""a symphony of crackles."" And it all takes place in a picture-perfect autumn Paris where golden leaves float above the Seine and the rainbow-hued windows of Notre Dame glow quietly in the night. (The rats for the record all have French names but sound American while most of the humans speak with zesty Gallic accents. Perhaps this is because the rats can talk aloud only amongst themselves? Remy in the kitchen with Linguini can only mime and nod. I suppose in a world that can encompass a rat chef theres a sort of whimsical logic to this.) Ultimately as Remy learns to make peace with his desire to blend rathood with culinary aspirations (""I cant choose between two halves of myself"" he says) ""Ratatouille"" emerges as a sweet tale of finding ones bliss however unusual that bliss may be. Like the meals it depicts its delicious and I cant wait for a second helping.

"Ratatouille A four-star rat - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeRatatouille A four-star ratAnimated tale of an unlikely chef is a feast for adults that kids will likeBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 06/29/2007 120000 AM PDTUpdated 06/29/2007 121654 AM PDTClick photo to enlarge""Ratatouille"" tells the story of a rat and a garbage boy who join forces to create incredible meals in a French restaurant.<<1>>The animating idea at Pixar before it was consumed by Disney last year was to make feature-length cartoons for kids but encode them with enough sophisticated humor so that parents would eagerly tag along. ""Ratatouille"" - undoubtedly the first Disney feature whose title ever came with a pronouncer (rat-a-too-ee) - also is the first Pixar picture to turn the previous formula thrillingly on its head. This is an animated movie thats been made for adults although kids probably will enjoy it too. Its a subversive idea and not one youre likely to hear anyone at Disney even acknowledge let alone endorse. But there is plenty of confirming evidence most notably the films interest in snooty restaurants and sauced foods and the presence of Thomas Keller - chef of the famed French Laundry in Napa Valley - listed among the credits as the films culinary consultant. Just try finding one of those in ""A Bugs Life."" Writer-director Brad Bird demonstrated a similar interest in ideas that appeal more to parents than kids in his first Pixar film ""The Incredibles"" but because it was about superheroes no one noticed what he was really up to. For all its visual razzle-dazzle that pictures real themes dealt with mediocrity in the schools baby boomers coming to grips with middle-age and the suburbanization of the American dream.Advertisement Bird has whipped up a homespun stew of ideas - much like his new films signature dish - about not letting where you come from (in this case a rats nest) prevent you from following your bliss. The beauty of ""Ratatouille"" is more notional than the anthropomorphic homilies spun by the movies Disney forebears (""Song of the South"" anyone?) and Bird has disguised his themes under a fantastic demi-glaze of computer animation. The climactic shot in ""Ratatouille"" is among the most beautiful and brilliantly realized things Ive ever seen. It involves another of Birds great character creations the critic and towering food snob Anton Ego (voiced by Peter OToole) whose lacerating review of Gusteaus and the death of its chef-owner Auguste Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett) has reduced the once great gastronomic mecca of Paris from five stars to three. Even among foodie families the significance of this desecrating reduction may require some explaining - and then tearful hand-holding - when the 6-year-olds are told. Not since ""Babettes Feast"" has a movie cared so deeply about food. While previous animated pictures have confined themselves mostly to characters who gnaw on drumsticks and carrots here every bell pepper and chanterelle mushroom has its day. And it is all done in service of a rat who wants to work in the worlds most rat-phobic place a restaurants kitchen. But Remy (the voice of comedian Patton Oswalt) realizes one day that he has a gourmet nose and a taste for lifes finer things. Or at least finer than the garbage hes been eating. He is guided in his unlikely quest by Gusteaus ghost who reminds him ""A cook makes. A thief takes."" But when Remy tells his father (voiced by Brian Dennehy) that he wants to spend more time in the kitchen and less with his nose buried in a slop pail the old rat cant understand why he wants to be around humans who are not known for their rodent-loving tendencies. When Remy gets caught standing on a kitchen counter by a little old lady with a big old shotgun she bids him adieu and farewell with a large serving of buckshot flambe. The occasional appearances of Gusteaus ghost allow Bird to teach his audience a thing or two about cooking while the chef explains it to the rat. Remys dream of becoming a great cook gets a boost when he discovers a way to turn Linguini the garbage boy in Gusteaus kitchen into his personal marionette. Soon Remy has his own chefs toque even if hes hiding under it as it sits on Linguinis head. The film has several fabulous visual sequences such as Remys ascent from the sewers to the rooftops of Paris where he and we see the Eiffel Tower for the first time. Later as he is trying to escape the humans in Gusteaus kitchen we get a rats-eye view as he scurries under flaming ovens and through dishwater. But when Remy finally gets his chance to escape and go back home he cant resist improving the soup that Linguini has been ruining. He lingers risking everything. A pinch of this a dash of that. When a critic declares the soup a hit Linguini gets the credit and becomes an instant star. The only one who suspects there might be more to the situation - and less to Linguini - than meets the eye is the nefarious Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm) the dictatorial chef at Gusteaus. At 3-foot-6 Skinner is like ""The Incredibles"" Edna Mode before him - a tiny terror. Every time Linguini produces another improbable masterpiece in the kitchen Skinner smells a rat. And hes not wrong. `Ratatouille Rated G (all audiences) Voice cast Patton Oswalt Brian Dennehy Peter OToole Janeane Garofalo Brad Garrett Writer-director Brad Bird Running time 1 hour 51 minutes Contact Bruce Newman at bnewmanmercurynews.com or (408) 920-5004.

Even when theyre acting kind of cute during one scene the next might contain an image thats almost unnerving - a pair of beady eyes glowing in the dark or an army of vermin swarming a restaurant pantry. There are just enough slapstick moments to make the latest Pixar movie look in the commercials like a routine kid film but its something more complicated and much more satisfying. In addition to ranking among the greatest animated films in recent years ""Ratatouille"" is a foodie movie on par with ""Big Night"" and puts the first original spin on the ""Cyrano"" story since Steve Martins ""Roxanne."" The film has extraordinary visuals but the biggest triumph is director and co-writer Brad Birds ability to keep so many small plates spinning without losing his focus on the audiences wants and needs. ""Ratatouille"" never overwhelms even though its stocked with action romance historical content family drama and serious statements about the creation of art. And just when youre sure Bird and his team wont be able to pull together a coherent ending they unleash a memorable final 20 minutes that is alternately exhilarating and moving. If Pixar has shown a weakness during its strong run that started in 1995 with ""Toy Story"" its the lack of an edge. Technically and creatively the movies are genius. But tonally they always retreat to the creators happy place. The plots are made to entertain adults but the morals repeat the generic messages of lesser kid films Be yourself. Be true to your friends. Winning isnt everything. But like Birds ""The Iron Giant"" and to a lesser extent ""The Incredibles"" the directors latest is intended to challenge audiences on a higher level. Characters seem to speak in John Wooden-isms and the ""anyone can cook"" refrain in the film is just a starting point for the themes to be explored. Its a movie made by people who love to create and they want you to know what its like to feel that same rush. The beginning of ""Ratatouille"" is mostly just amusing as the key characters are slowly introduced. Remy is a rat from Frances countryside with a taste for fine food and a knack for combining flavors into new creations. While his Belushi-esque brother Emile eats garbage without thinking the gourmet Remy uses lightning to sear a mushroom to perfection then raids the local pantry for saffron. His counterpart is the human Linguini a bumbling but eager young cooks assistant who is the lowest in the culinary caste system at Gusteaus a once-great Paris restaurant whose brilliant namesake chef has died. In his place is the scheming Skinner whose attempts to exploit the Gusteau name at the expense of quality includes a proposed line of TV dinners. Remy and Linguini become a team and Skinner tries to stop them but the core story is just a framework -- like the ordinary 2-by-4s that hold up an ornate Victorian mansion. ""Ratatouille"" is a Pixar creation but there are moments that will remind viewers of Birds best work in the early seasons of ""The Simpsons"" where just traveling from Point A to Point B is a visual extravaganza packed with clever sight jokes. Among the creative touches is Remys description of his love of fine cuisine which is illustrated onscreen by colorful fireworks displays to represent food combinations. Later when Gusteau starts speaking to Remy he comes to life in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" style from the books signs and other products that display his face. And the movies food critic Anton Ego is deliciously harsh -- his Grinch-like presence that much more imposing because hes voiced by Peter OToole. The decision to make the characters look and move like real rats was probably meant to challenge audience perceptions but its anyones guess what effect the gimmick will have on your kids. ""Ratatouille"" is filmed from both rodent and human perspectives with the rats talking to each other one moment and squeaking the next. During scenes where hundreds of rats scurry around human quarters the visual almost makes your skin crawl. The vermin in the lead roles were already a marketing crutch. (Do you want to buy a box of Frosted Mini-Wheats with a rat on the front?) While ""Ratatouille"" is rated G its difficult to imagine that many children will demand repeated viewings of a movie with a 110-minute running time and action scenes that are few and far between. But the film is virtually adult-proof -- even grown-ups who claim to hate animated movies will enjoy this one -- and should lead to Bird finally getting the credit he deserves. While the filmmakers work on ""The Incredibles"" wasnt exactly ignored (he received a screenwriting Oscar nomination and won the best animated feature award) this should be the movie that makes him known as a great director without the qualifier ""of animated movies"" tacked on to the end of the statement. ""Ratatouille"" is a classic. -- Advisory This film contains cartoon violence characters in peril and more health code violations than a Krusty Burger franchise in Hamelin.

The title isnt in English and a good percentage of the audience has probably never tasted it let alone heard of it. The hero Remy is a rat. Not only that a rat who spends most of his time just where we dont want to see one--in a kitchen. The setting is Paris and the movie is a love letter to a romantic notion of France that is not currently in fashion at least in certain political quarters. And who would ever think of making a family movie aimed at foodies?Has Pixar lost its pixilated mind? Pas du tout. Brad Bird the unconventional creator of ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles"" has come up with a film as rich as a sauce bearnaise as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK one more and then Ill be done its yummy.Bird seems to relish the challenge and even at first to encourage our resistance to his rodent comedy. It starts out dark in the rainy French countryside and while the blue rat Remy himself is rather cute and able to stand on two feet (not to mention read menus in French) his extended family really do look like rats. Nothing cuddly about them. Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is your classic outsider. He turns up his finely calibrated nose at eating garbage--unlike his beefy good-natured brother Emile (Peter Sohn) or his stern dad (Brian Dennehy) who cant understand his passion for fine food. Turning his furry back on his heritage he aspires to become a gourmet chef like his human idol Gustave the celebrated Parisian four-star chef whose cookbook ""Anyone Can Cook"" is his inspiration. Its unlikely however that the late Gustave--whose ghost supplies our hero with otherworldly pep talks during his travails--had a four legged long-tailed gourmand in mind when he wrote it. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week How does a rat rise to culinary stardom? Thats ""Ratatouille""s grand slapstick joke. Remys tragedy is that the species he most admires--us humans--all want to kill him. What saves him is the cloddish kitchen clean-up boy Linguini (Lou Romano) who inadvertently gets credit for creating the magnificent soup that was in fact prepared by Remy. The two form a partnership of convenience with the rat hidden in the boys chefs hat guiding Linguinis every culinary move by yanking on his hair like a puppet master. The deft daffy physical comedy is worthy of Blake Edwards in his best ""Pink Panther"" days. Indeed the villainous new master chef of Gustaves the tiny ferocious Skinner (Ian Holm) calls to mind Herbert Loms eternal frustrated Dreyfus as hes driven nuts trying to ferret out the mystery of how the incompetent Linguini could be producing such crowd- and critic-pleasing food. And speaking of critics Peter OToole dripping effete hauteur delights in the role of Anton Ego the most feared food critic in Paris. I wont spoil the joke but the epiphany Ego has when tasting Remys ratatouille is a flash of comic brilliance hilarious and unexpectedly moving.If Pixars last movie ""Cars"" was hampered by the unavoidable fact that automobile hoods just arent all that expressive ""Ratatouille""s lovingly detailed computer animation is a marvel of subtle shrugs and sly facial gestures. Even the food has character (Thomas Keller the legendary chef of Napas French Laundry was a consultant even designing some of the dishes). What all these gourmet touches will mean to tots is an open question. ""Ratatouille"" may prove more fascinating to grown-ups than little kids whose interest in food (other than candy) tends to be functional at best. But surely theyll relate to Remys cockeyed quest. Like the extraordinary family in Birds ""Incredibles"" who refuse to hide their superhuman gifts under a bushel of conformity Remy wont settle for anything less than the best. Hes obviously a stand-in for the moviemaker the rat as artist. More leisurely and less pop than the wonderful ""Toy Story"" movies ""Ratatouille"" may look and feel kind of French but its message of self-realization against all odds couldnt be more American.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The idea of another cartoon about a rat - one who becomes a gourmet cook no less - was not something I was particularly looking forward to after last years overbearing Aardman-DreamWorks collaboration ""Flushed Away."" But as with ""The Incredibles"" which sounded less than promising as a concept Bird specializes in spectacularly defying expectations. For maximum enjoyment you should probably just take my word that this one is unmissable - stunningly rendered images in a story chock-full of surprises and unforgettable characters a G-rated flick sophisticated enough to delight adults as well as kids - and head straight for the nearest theater. And plan on getting very hungry - Chef Thomas Keller of Per Se served as a consultant for the kitchen scenes and the result is one of the great food movies of all time. Like ""The Incredibles"" this new flick is a plea against mediocrity - and a reminder that genius can turn up in the unlikeliest places. In this case its a young French blue rodent named Remy (voiced by comic Patton Oswalt) who is gifted with an extraordinary sense of smell and taste buds. Hes positively inspired by a TV cooking show with Chef Anton Gusteau (Brad Garrett) whose motto is ""Anyone can cook"" When Remy is accidentally swept into a storm drain he turns up at Gusteaus restaurant in Paris which has fallen on hard times. Gusteau is dead the place has been demoted to three stars (from five) - and the place is lorded over by Skinner (Ian Holm) a diminutive despot who has licensed Gusteaus name for dubious frozen foods. A rat of course is less than welcome in the kitchen - except by the ghost of Gusteau. The spirit encourages Remy to surreptitiously turn a soup accidentally ruined by a bumbling kitchen assistant named Linguini (Lou Romano) into a culinary masterpiece. When the talentless Linguini is ordered to duplicate this masterpiece hes forced to turn to Remy as his Cyrano-esque partner. Hiding under Linguinis toque Remy yanks on the young mans hair like a puppeteer to steer him to the proper ingredients and spices. This Chaplin-caliber physical comedy which puts most live-action comedies to shame is alone worth the price of admission. I wont give away the rest of the story - which my daughter Xan an animation buff calls the most surprise-filled toon shes ever seen. But I will note that Remy is eventually forced to choose between his budding shadow career and his food-scavenging family. (Brian Dennehy provides the voice of his dad.) Unlike the folks at DreamWorks Bird wisely eschews A-list stars for the voice talent including fine work by Janeane Garofalo as the very French Colette the only woman in the Gusteau kitchen - and with more than a little help from Remy Linguinis love interest. The biggest name in the cast list is Peter OToole superb as an imperious cadaverous food critic named Anton Ego. Composer Michael Giacchino who deserved an Oscar for his jazzy score for ""The Incredibles"" will hopefully get it for his dazzling work on this one. The music perfectly compliments the visuals and helps transport you into the story. And Brad Bird should start clearing space on his mantel for another Oscar. Its hard to imagine anything in the foreseeable future will top ""Ratatouille"" for sheer artistry and inventiveness. lou.lumenicknypost.com RATATOUILLEEight-course feast.Running time 108 minutes.

Friday June 29 2007 1119 AM Ratatouille. Computer-animated comedy about a rat that secretly guides the hand of a Paris chef. With voices of Patton Oswalt Ian Holm Janeane Garofalo. Director Brad Bird (150). Rated G. At area theaters. The Pixar magic continues with Brad Birds ""Ratatouille"" a gorgeous wonderfully inventive computer-animated comedy about a Paris sewer rat who dreams of becoming a gourmet chef and has his dream come true - sort of. He becomes the mentor of a chef who doesnt know how to cook using a form of sign language (he hides under the chefs bonnet and tugs his hair in various directions) to help him become a rising star in French cuisine. Yes a rat in a restaurant kitchen is an odd premise but there isnt a queasy moment in the film. For one thing the rat - Remy (Patton Oswalt) - is one of the sweetest animated heroes since ""Bambi."" Hes also a little beauty; how many rats have you seen with a gray-green sheen to their fur? Like the last three Pixar movies ""Ratatouille"" is long (150) for an animated cartoon and has a story more complicated than most. The general drift is that Remy and his surrogate chef Linguini (Lou Romano) are bringing life - and patrons - back to a once-great restaurant that went bad after the death of its beloved owner-chef Gusteau. Though Linguini doesnt know it he is heir to the restaurant which is now being run by a bullying head chef named Skinner (Ian Holm) who intends to deny Linguini his inheritance. Among the subplots is an unlikely romance that blooms between the klutzy Linguini and the tough-minded sous chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo) and Remys strained relationship with family and friends back in the rat colony. Im running out of superlatives for high-end computer animation. I thought Pixars ""Cars"" couldnt be topped until I saw George Millers ""Happy Feet"" a few months later. Now Im thinking ""Ratatouille"" may have topped them both. Though it doesnt have the screamingly fast images of ""Cars"" and ""Happy Feet"" the detail in the restaurant and in the streets and cityscapes of Paris is extraordinary. With the exception of Peter OToole who voices the snotty restaurant critic Anton Ego ""Ratatouille"" doesnt boast an A-list cast but its the voice performances that fill out the fantasy and they are perfect.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 29 2007 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 13 2009 957PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Ratatouille Written and directed by Brad Bird Featuring the voices of Patton Oswalt Lou Romano Janeane Garofalo Ian Holm Classification G 1/2 The new Pixar movie Ratatouille takes its inspiration from the French habit of turning icky things - snails frogs legs fatty livers - into delicacies. Its the story of a rat named Remy who achieves his dream of becoming a master chef in a fine Paris restaurant. The gag is loaded with opportunities to gag Will that be creme brulee aux droppings? With straggly blue fur and a dangling pink nose that protrudes like an insistent nipple Remy is no ordinary vermin. As he tells us in the opening voice-over (by comedian Patton Oswalt who sounds like a young Wallace Shawn) hes a rodent who aspires to rise above his scavenging relatives. While his brother and father are happy to eat anything they can steal Remy inspired by a famous chef named Auguste Gusteau author of the book Anyone Can Cook aspires to culinary artistry. When one of Remys food-hunting expeditions goes awry he and the rest of his rat colony are obliged to leave their country home and disperse. Through the sewers. Remy finds himself in Paris at the restaurant of the late Gusteau (Brad Garrett) who appears to Remy as a ghostly culinary and spiritual guide. One night after watching the kitchens garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) ruin a soup Remy cant restrain himself. He sneaks into the kitchen throws in a few pawfuls of spices and turns the soup into a masterpiece. The envious head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) assumes that Linguini created the soup and insists he repeat his triumph. Linguini and Remy become partners. Like Cyrano de Bergerac Remy secretly guides Linguini hiding under his chefs toque and pulling his hair left and right to send him signals on when to stir and which spice to add. The story percolates along with playful tension. Theres the risk of discovery from a jealous Skinner who is secretly trying to sell Gusteaus recipes to a frozen-food company. Theres the risk of another visit from the cruel food critic Anton Ego (whose perspective is altered in a Proustian moment when he bites into a specially prepared humble ratatouille dish). Narrative side dishes include Linguinis possible love interest in another cook the temperamental Charlotte (Janeane Garofalo) and Remys army of dirty relatives ever on the lookout for handouts who gather around the kitchen door. Though unusual in a contemporary childrens movie for rejecting the usual message of self-esteem (Remy finds his fellow rats repellent) Ratatouille is conventional fare enhanced with superb presentation. The city of Paris is rendered with a lively mix of 19th-century Impressionism and contemporary photo-realism. No sketchy backgrounds here - Ratatouilles scenes feels like deep-focus camera shots. The textures from the gleam of copper pans to the cobblestone streets are almost palpable. The chase sequences and slapstick comedy are choreographed to a whisker from unusual perspectives under floorboards over counters down sewers and dangling from chandeliers. Make what you will of the movies free-and-easy use of accents. Peter OToole as the supercilious critic speaks in an English accent from sepulchral depths. The snooty French kitchen staff speak English with lip-pursed French accents; Linguini the garbage boy turned hero and all the rats sound American which may compound the joke. A French rat as a master chef? Absurd. But a brilliant French chef with an American accent?

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Why the great animators dont take advantage of real beloved cityscapes more often is a mystery especially after enjoying the rich pleasures of ""Ratatouille."" Paris is a tactile fully formed movie character in this thoroughly winning Pixar animation. The city is at once immediately familiar and endlessly mysterious giving depth and feeling to everything happening in the foreground. At one point in ""Ratatouille"" our hero the rodent Remy scampers up a slate roof at night and we know what he will find when he gets to the top - first we hold our breath and then the sight of Paris takes our remaining breath away. In Pixars hands Paris twinkles and gleams promising everything to everyone - even a rat. Much as we loved the bland suburbia of ""Toy Story"" and the exotic undersea of ""Finding Nemo"" ""Ratatouille"" opens a beautiful chapter for Pixar. What a future of films this Paris promises a raccoon in New York City? A sea lion in San Francisco? An armadillo in Old Santa Fe? Movies should take us places weve never been but they should also make us love at a whole new level the places where we already live. ""Ratatouille"" opens with a brief interlude in the countryside where Remy and his extended mob/family inhabit the nether regions of an old farmhouse and its compost piles. Remy looks for the tastiest food but the clan appreciates him only for his ability to smell rat poison. ""Were thieves Dad and what were stealing is garbage"" says Remy voiced by Patton Oswalt of ""The King of Queens."" ""If no one wants it were not stealing"" his dad trumps. ""If no one wants it then why are we stealing it?"" Remy sputters. While the vermin forage Remy sneaks into the kitchen in search of ingredients like saffron and watches the TV cooking shows starring the late great French chef Gusteau. When Granny Farmer discovers a nest of rats with her wayward shotgun Remy flees via the sewers and winds up in Paris - surprise - near Gusteaus restaurant. Plots thicken like a good bechamel. A klutzy new line chef at Gusteaus could use Remys delicate nose in concocting new dishes for a tyrannical boss. The current chef at Gusteaus is ruining the family name with a tacky line of frozen foods. The snide local food critic voiced deliciously by Peter OToole may appear at any moment to determine Gusteaus populist fate. And Remys family will find him threatening to overwhelm Gusteaus stockroom during midnight foraging. Writer and director Brad Bird keeps ""Ratatouille"" moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films. As he proved in ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles"" Bird shepherds stories about characters with big dreams while populating his worlds with the right ratio of peppy sidekicks and intriguing eccentrics. The visual palette Bird chooses is always distinguished as well. Here he uses purples browns and grays to shade Paris with a veritable rats nest of fascinating tales. Bird clearly studied the chaotic dance of a real restaurant kitchen. ""Ratatouille"" boasts a few tour-de-force scenes with a rats eye-view of Remy hiding behind stock pots and jumping through spice racks while he searches for a culinary opening. This is the happier side of the filthy kitchens rendered so depressingly in Orwells ""Down and Out in Paris and London"" - when youre a rat on the floor everything looks like a step up. ""Ratatouille"" is a chefs delight from beginning to end. Foodies can breathe deep of the animators and screenwriters sensual presentation of Gusteaus creations. Even from the mouths of rats discussion of a proper soup stock can be envigorating. You know you will see a ratatouille appear at some point and the ultimate presentation of that dish is magnificent. Viewers even get a cinematic amuse-bouche The movie is preceded by a wordless hilarious short called ""Lifted"" about an alien going through his ""drivers ed"" on a spaceship attempting to abduct a sleeping human through a window. And the ""Ratatouille"" credits are retro cool mindful of a good Pink Panther episode. With Pixar you get all seven courses.

"This is no dirty rat - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW This is no dirty ratBrad Birds `Ratatouille is so audacious you have to fall in love with its unlikely hero.June 29 2007|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer IF we are living in a golden age of animation -- and we are -- one of the reasons is writer-director Brad Bird. Thats somewhat ironic because as his new ""Ratatouille"" demonstrates what makes Bird so unusual is that he doesnt really think of himself as an animator at all.From his exceptional previous features (""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles"") through this one Bird has refused to ghettoize himself refused to back off from his passion to make movies whose animated surface doesnt stop them from touching the same emotional bases as live-action fare. When Pixar executive producer John Lasseter says ""Theres a level of depth complexity and humor to this film that I dont think any Pixar film has had before"" hes not giving in to hyperbole hes getting at the heart of Birds concerns.The story of another creature that refuses to be ghettoized in this case a rat -- yes a rat -- with the palate of an epicure and a passion to be the greatest chef in the world ""Ratatouille"" is as audacious as they come. It takes risks and goes places other films wouldnt dare and it ends up putting rival imaginations in the shade.Whereas the tendency in so much of todays animation is to be glib and on the surface ""Ratatouille"" and its Pixar brethren have carved out a place for themselves by being genuinely smart and sophisticated in ways that please audiences as much as critics.""Ratatouille"" also takes full advantage of what the medium of computer animation offers. As much as story director Bird and his team love great chases wild rides and wacky adventures and setting this film both in a breathtakingly beautiful Paris and the unnerving sewers beneath the city offers ample opportunity for all manner of visual play.Although mice have been members in good standing of the animation community at least since Ub Iwerks drew Mickey Mouse in 1928 the idea (which started with animator Jan Pinkava who shares a story credit) of making a rat the hero of a major motion picture is a lot nervier than having penguins or other cuddly folk in the first position.And to its credit ""Ratatouille"" is surprisingly candid about letting rats be rats. Yes our hero Remy walks on his hind legs (the better to keep his front paws clean for eating) and has a face as expressive as that of a Yiddish theater actor but his fellow rats swarm in such realistic packs it is a real gut-check to see them scurrying about. And asking audiences to accept them as heroes is a riskier gambit still.Yet this is exactly what Bird and his gang accomplish. Theyve made ""Ratatouille"" so imaginative good spirited and funny that it not only blurs the line between reality and fantasy it manages to blur it between species as well. And it does it all an amusing ""Quality Assurance Guarantee"" boasts in the closing credits with ""100% Genuine Animation No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film.""Of course it doesnt hurt to have a character as endearing as Remy (winningly voiced by comic Patton Oswalt) as a protagonist. Someone with the soul of a poet as well as such a highly developed sense of taste and smell that his father uses him as a poison tester Remy ignores his familys garbage-eating proclivities and insists ""If you are what you eat I only want to eat good stuff.""Remys hero is the legendary Parisian chef Auguste Gusteau whose ""anyone can cook"" motto he takes to heart. Gusteau sadly is no longer among the living done in by among other things the acid words of cadaverous food critic Anton Ego a.k.a. ""The Grim Eater"" splendidly voiced by the man Bird wrote the part for Peter OToole.Several tricks of fate bring Remy not only to Paris but to Gusteaus itself now run by the villainous Skinner (Ian Holm) an entrepreneur more interested in selling over-hyped frozen food than running a great restaurant.Also arriving at the same time is Linguini (Lou Romano) an awkward young man the son of a former employee who dreams of chefdom but who has no discernible talent in that area. Hired as a garbage boy his chances of advancement are nil. Until he meets Remy.One of the joys of ""Ratatouille"" is watching as these two discover that they need each other -- Linguini cant cook without Remys guidance and Remy wouldnt be allowed to set foot in a kitchen without Linguini as a front man -- and then painstakingly construct a Rube Goldberg system that allows them to work together without speaking the same language.Making the whole thing stranger still is that Remy is in constant communication with a vision of the late great chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"") who doesnt let being a figment of Remys imagination stop him from giving great advice.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOn the trail of those dirty ratsApril 28 2004Rat Race Gnaws at the Nerves of Riverside County Home...June 18 1989Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/29/entertainment/et-ratatouille29,200,ratatouille21,ratatouille,latimes
"Pixars Ratatouille reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Pixars Ratatouille reviewed. Pixars Ratatouille reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateSummer MoviesThe joy of blockbusters.June 28 2007 1049 AM Happy Meal Ratatouille moved me to tears. By Dana Stevens Read more from Slates Summer Movies. Remy and Linguini There was a moment near the end of Ratatouille (Disney)--the scene in which a snooty food critic hilariously voiced by Peter OToole finally samples the movies title dish--when I choked up a little bit. Not for the usual reasons youd cry in a movie because the story was moving (though it was) or because I identified with the protagonists triumph (though I did). No Ratatouille moved me to tears because it was just so well-done--not kinda cute not OK-for-a-kids-movie but a work of art crafted with as much passion and attention to detail as its hero Remy the rat chef puts into every vat of soup he makes. Ratatouille is Brad Birds best movie yet and from the writer-director who made two of the best American animated features of the past decade The Incredibles and the sadly neglected Iron Giant thats something. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is a very unusual rat. Somehow in a lifetime of sorting through human garbage with his furry tribe hes developed a taste for fresh and delicious food to the scorn of his brother Emile (Peter Sohn) and father Django (Brian Dennehy). It doesnt hurt that these are French rats so the refuse they cull through includes some fine ingredients including a mushroom that Remy swears would be divine if it were properly prepared. His subsequent attempt to swipe some spices from the same kitchen results in a frenzied escape for the whole rat clan. Accidentally separated from his family Remy winds up in the kitchen of a top-flight Parisian restaurant Gusteaus thats fallen on hard times since the death of its founder. But the late Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett) appears to Remy in spirit form--sublimely animated to appear both diaphanous and obese--and encourages him to realize his dream and get into the kitchen. Advertisement Of course a rat in a restaurant kitchen is hardly welcomed as a potential apprentice. The unscrupulous Skinner (Ian Holm) whos taken over Gusteaus after the master chefs death orders the kitchens new garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) to dispose of the pest but Remys mute entreaty touches Linguinis heart and they wind up rooming together. The pair are soon teaming up in Gusteaus kitchen Remy hiding beneath Linguinis hat to create culinary masterpieces that the clumsy lad gets credit for. There are complications involving Skinner the hard-boiled sous-chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo) and others but Ill leave you to be surprised by the story which leaps and skitters as nimbly as Remy himself. The lead rats bodily movements seem to have sprung from countless hours of observing both rodents and Paul Giamatti. Hes schlumpy and self-effacing but irresistibly menschy and the conceit that he and Linguini can communicate only through sign language--Remy talks but only to other rats and his buddy the ghost--makes for some wonderfully subtle scenes between the two. And the animation oh the animation. Every hair in Remys coat a shimmering field of blues grays and greens appears to have its own life. The scene in which the rat colony washes through the sewers of Paris is a breathtaking study in the movement of churning water--in addition to being a plainly great action sequence. The food is drawn and imagined so beautifully (with the help of French Laundry chef Thomas Keller who consulted on the movie) that you walk out wishing youd made reservations at Per Se. Its refreshing to see an animated feature that doesnt feel compelled to stuff every speaking part with Julia Robertses and Snoop Doggs. The in-house Pixar voice talent is used to great effect for many roles including major ones. And Michael Giacchinos score is reminiscent of Looney Tunes composer Carl Stalling an omnivorous mashup of influences from beat jazz to French chanson. I have no question that Ratatouille will be both a great critical success and a durable childrens classic on DVD. But I wonder whether it will draw summer audiences to theaters in the numbers it should. The films relatively low-key marketing campaign (its hard to imagine Remy tie-ins in a Happy Meal) and difficult-to-pronounce title (as the poster points out its rat-a-TOO-ee) may give the false impression that this movie isnt for everyone. It is Its got slapstick romance rodents and a touch of saffron. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

The word is ""genial."" Not genial as in cheerful though Pixars latest animated feature is certainly that but genial with an accent as in brilliant or inspired. The characters are irresistible -- why would anyone want to resist a hero who so gallantly transcends his rattiness? -- the animation is astonishing and the film a fantasy version of a foodie rhapsody sustains a level of joyous invention that hasnt been seen in family entertainment since ""The Incredibles."" ENLARGE The uncommon denominator of both productions is Brad Bird the writer-director-cum-field marshal who once again has led an army of artists and technicians in the making of a film that feels both personal and classic. Theres the same unerring showmanship which makes a complex story seem luminously logical the same delight in hurtling motion sophisticated comedy (which flatters kids and grownups alike) and copious detail. Instead of using the kitchen of a fancy French restaurant as a picturesque background ""Ratatouille"" explores the workplace and its frenzied rituals -- as well as its intricate hierarchy -- with a screwball zest worthy of the sainted Julia Child. And Remy slices dices and cooks with thrilling ingenuity that overcomes his dual deficits in standing and stature. But is the world ready for a movie that sees an upwardly mobile rodent in a kitchen as a cause for celebration rather than extermination? Once youve met the clean little rat in question and registered the high preposterousness of the premise -- not to mention the elegance of the execution -- the answer is yes. Remy is a born foodie ""If you are what you eat I only want to eat the good stuff."" And hes a dreamer who uses his highly refined sniffer to follow his bliss. What makes him so endearing though -- and surely winning to kids -- is that hes a quintessential outcast an underrat whos first reviled by the very people who come to lionize him. When Pixar Animation Studios released ""The Incredibles"" in 2004 the company served notice that its computer animation techniques could rival or excel much of the action in live-action movies. Now Pixar as part of Disney has taken those techniques to new heights of virtuosity -- and new depths during a vertiginous ride through the City of Lights sewers. (Although the complexities of fluid dynamics have posed formidable problems for animators the results here are so convincing that you wonder if they cheated by pouring water into their computers.) ""Ratatouilles"" tour de force sequence turns on a partnership between Remy and the restaurants dishwasher a clueless gangly kid named Linguini. The rat cooks by remote control as he rides like a cross between a puppeteer and a mahout inside Linguinis toque. Their wild dance is repeated a bit too often but its the funniest thing of its kind since Steve Martins body was possessed by Lily Tomlins spirit in ""All Of Me."" The cast of characters is large remarkably varied and wonderfully voiced especially Ian Holms Skinner the restaurants dwarfish dictatorial head chef; Janeane Garofalos Colette a feminist chef with a passion to succeed in a milieu dominated by men and Peter OTooles Anton Ego a food critic of vulpine physique and acidulous demeanor. Anton is as you might guess an insufferable esthete but he is also bless his caustic soul eager for new experiences. And so it falls to him to taste and savor the vegetable dish of the movies title in a moment of comic revelation that is nothing short of sublime. Sicko When the government stripped Mr. Incredible of his superhero status in ""The Incredibles"" he was reduced to working in the claims department of an HMO where his job was to deny claims. His testimony would have been a worthy addition to ""Sicko"" though Michael Moores argumentative blogumentary about health care is shockingly funny -- and sometimes genuinely shocking -- without him. Mr. Moore sees the United States as a nation in denial so much so that weve slipped to number 37 in a World Health Organization ranking just ahead of Slovenia. Lashing out with Swiftian scorn at a system that leaves almost 50 million Americans uninsured he finds ample reason for outrage in scarifying stories told not only by the uninsured but by those whose insurance companies failed or betrayed them. Just as Al Gore did with global warming in ""An Inconvenient Truth"" he frames the health care crisis in moral and ethical terms. ""Who are we?"" he asks. ""Is this what weve become?"" One might also ask whats new here. Coming at a time when Americas health care system is being scrutinized and debated as never before ""Sicko"" covers familiar ground. Yet the question misses the point for the movies appeal lies at the intersection of its timing and style. Precisely because our concerns about health care have become so immediate and because the production package is so entertaining the shrewdly titled ""Sicko"" may help stimulate the debate. But -- and yes with a Michael Moore film there is always a but -- the filmmaker cant leave ill enough alone. With hardly a nod toward critical thinking he represents the universal health care systems in Canada Britain and France as essentially flawless through the use of ardent interview subjects extravagant praise and slippery rhetorical devices. And the claims he makes for those countries are positively modest in comparison to his discovery of health-care heaven in Cuba (which happens to be 39th in that W.H.O. ranking a fact that can be gleaned from a fleeting close-up of the list but one thats never mentioned in the course of the film). Its bitterly funny when the filmmaker seeks treatment for a group of chronically ill Sept. 11 rescue volunteers by taking them on a boat to the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay where he contends Al Qaeda prisoners get better medical care than mainland Americans. Yet its embarrassing when the jaunty provocateur turns earnest propagandist and sails off with his ad hoc wards to Havana where doctors and nurses are happy to minister to their new patients on camera. (Its also embarrassing that our Treasury Department has put Mr. Moore under investigation for possible violations of the trade embargo against Cuba.) Lots of ""Sicko"" stands as boffo political theater but its major domo lost me by losing his sense of humor. Live Free or Die Hard Dont judge ""Live Free or Die Hard"" by its title which sounds like a license-plate motto or make snide assumptions as I did about the impending death of the ""Die Hard"" franchise. John McClane the New York cop played by Bruce Willis may be long in the tooth but he hasnt lost his bite. This fourth iteration of a series that first burst upon the world in 1988 turns out to be terrific entertainment and startlingly shrewd in the bargain a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh as you gape at their thunderous extravagance. ENLARGE Bruce Willis returns as police detective John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard. The film was directed by Len Wiseman from a smart fluent script by Mark Bomback. The plot involves a cyber plot -- a computer-based attack against American institutions particularly financial institutions on a scale so vast that the good guys (at the FBI) as well as the bad guys (in a mobile facility that looks like a Best Buy showroom) call the concerted attack a Fire Sale -- ""everything goes."" And the shrewdest part of the film is its teaming of the creaky (but buff) McClane whos derided by a baddie as a ""Timex in a digital age"" with a young computer whiz named Matt Farrell; hes played by Justin Long the casually charming actor who embodies the cool Mac in those Apple commercials that make fun of Microsofts Windows. (Timothy Olyphant gives another strong performance as the Fire Sales mastermind Gabriel.) The Macs cool carries over but ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" warms it up by putting it in a moral context; Matt must redeem himself however frightened by the danger he may be because he wrote the mutating encryption algorithm -- Im just quoting from my notes -- that gave the Fire Sale program its basic structure. All of this is an elaborate excuse of course for the taciturn John McClane to take endless punishment in the course of saving civilization while kung fu fighters fight a Harrier jump jet harries an 18-wheeler and a cop car goes airborne to bring a chopper down. Good for him and for us.    DVD TIP Ive recommended it before but I keep meeting parents and kids who havent heard of ""The Iron Giant"" (1999). Brad Birds debut feature about a boy and his alien robot isnt on a par with ""The Incredibles"" or ""Ratatouille"" -- how could it be and what is? -- but the film is pretty great in its own right.

In fact hes adorable. And adept Remy can cook circles around most humans and he does so in this brilliant computer-animated affair. The tale of a scrappy dreamer with the instincts of a master chef Ratatouille set in a vibrant Jacques Tati-inspired Paris full of colorful old bikes scooters and cars comes from animator Brad Bird. In 1999 Bird released The Iron Giant the traditionally drawn gem about a boy and his intergalactic robot. In 2005 he won an Oscar for The Incredibles his hilarious digital toon featuring the adventures of a misfit family of superheroes. With Ratatouille Bird once again delivers not just a great witty story but dazzling visuals as well. The characters (animal and human) and the settings (humble country kitchens an elegant Paris eatery) are rendered with the style and flair of vintage cartoon classics but with the wild wheeling POVs and depth and dimension that are the hallmark of digital animation too. Bird really is one of the best in the business. Like Robert Lawsons gradeschool best seller Ben and Me in which a resourceful colonial mouse helps Founding Father Ben Franklin with his inventions Ratatouille is a tale of interspecies friendship and inspiration. Remy (the voice of Patton Oswalt) once in Paris meets a goofy redheaded kid Linguini (Lou Romano) who has gone to work at the gourmet landmark named for its famous chef Auguste Gusteau. Linguini is a lowly busboy scrubbing the pans and taking out the trash but with Remys assistance and insistence Linguini starts adding dollops of herbs splashes of spices to the soups and side dishes. Patrons are wowed and soon Linguini is given more responsibility to the chagrin of pretty sous chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo) and the restaurants nasty-tempered top toque Skinner (Ian Holm). In reality of course it is Remy creating the culinary art. But whos going to believe a rat is capable of such delectable fare? And who would eat it if they knew a rat with its icky paws and creepy tail was the source of the sauce? Gusteaus would be closed the food world shocked. With a clever chase sequence along the banks of the Seine River with kitchen scenes as cinematic (and hunger-inducing) as anything in the live-action gastronomic hits Babettes Feast and Big Night with a script that plays to both kids and adults without pandering to either Ratatouille is simply grand. Yes there are choppy bits where the pacing lags and sags and transitions hit a bump but whos complaining? All Bird needs to do is go for a closeup of ""little chef"" Remy his pink ears pricked up proudly his nose sniffing busily away and audiences will melt - like a cheese flambA(c).

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 29 2007 Save for later Saved ""Ratatouille"" the eighth feature from Disney-owned Pixar has an icky premise. Its about a rat named Remy who lives with his rodent brood in the French countryside and fulfills his dream of becoming a great chef in a legendary Parisian restaurant.Lets just say that youd be better off eating dinner before you see this film. I suppose its a tribute to writer-director Brad Bird who also made Pixars ""The Incredibles"" that the queasiness he induces is so real (at least for me). As usual with Pixar movies the animation is absolutely first rate. In sequence after sequence we are presented with visual set pieces that far exceed the imaginativeness of most live-action dramatic fare. The gleaming phantasmagoria of the kitchen where Remy works his wonders is offset by the tranquil glow of the Paris streets.But as was also true of Pixars last movie ""Cars"" ""Ratatouille"" is better at pleasing the eye than the other senses. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The story line is somewhat haphazard and repetitive and the protagonists dont have the roundedness and full-scale oddity that great animated movies generally require. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Remy for example is quick-witted and industrious but also a little boring. His adoration of the late great chef Auguste Gusteau whose motto is ""Anyone can cook"" wears thin. It is to Gusteaus restaurant that Remy repairs when he is separated from his family and it is there that he colludes with Linguini the scullery boy to whip up culinary masterpieces that rescue the eaterys reputation.Linguini has no talent for cooking and is acting as a front for Remy - who hides under the boys toque and pulls his hair to direct him to the right ingredients. The rubbery Linguini never quite catches fire either. His doofusness is generic.Maybe its just because I can relate to him but the best character for me was Anton Ego the sclerotic wire-thin restaurant critic who terrorizes all of Paris with his scathing reviews. As voiced by Peter OToole Ego is a splendid caricature whose motto is ""If I dont love it I dont swallow."" (That explains his thinness.)Given the fact that a mouse - Mickey Mouse to be exact - is perhaps the most recognizable commercial logo on the planet my squeamishness about cartoon rats may seem a bit churlish. But when it comes to rats in the movies I much prefer the human variety. At least in the kitchen. Grade B+ ""Ratatouille"" is rated G.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Toward the end of Ratatouille Pixars latest animated romp writer-director Brad Bird mounts such a cogent feeling pained deconstruction of professional criticism that viewers might almost suspect hes had problems with persnickety critics in the past. But how is that possible when everything he touches is wonderful? The writer-director behind The Iron Giant and The Incredibles (the former a critically beloved poorly marketed underperformer the latter a critically beloved smash) and an animation consultant on the likes of King Of The Hill and The Simpsons Bird has a rare cinematic gift the ability to stage slam-bang action sequences without neglecting the rich emotional resonance that makes for a great story. Ratatouille never hits the heights of The Incredibles if only because its operating on a much smaller and less mythic culturally resonant stage but its solid enough to prove that Bird hasnt let success critical or otherwise go to his head. Patton Oswalt stars as the voice of Remy a little gray French rat with a sensitive nose and a picky palate; while his family is scarfing down half-rotten trash hes dreamily following the dictates of the late world-renowned chef Auguste Gusteau who famously proclaimed ""Anyone can cook."" Remys obsessions nearly get him killed when he ventures into a Paris kitchen but before long he and a hapless cooking-impaired nebbish (Lou Romano) team up to wow Paris foodies. In spite of a number of zippy complications involving a glowering cadaverous food critic (Peter OToole) a snappish love interest (Janeane Garofalo) and a villainous little restaurateur whos prostituting Gusteaus name on products like ""microwavable chop-socky pockets"" Ratatouille is narratively thinner than Birds previous films. But he fills in the gaps with gawp-inducing setpieces that move at firework speeds as the tiny Remy dashes to avoid human-sized hazards or the rest of the cast works through calamity and chaos. As always Pixar (Toy Story Finding Nemo The Incredibles etc.) leads the growing pack of CGI studios on sheer quality; the visual attention to tiny details is almost distractingly opulent from the cuts and nicks on the chefs hands to the way Remys tiny chest flutters when hes panicked. And Bird aptly nails Pixars heady house blend of pathos action quirk and sheer good humor. Bird and his co-writers leave room for quiet moments and gentle morals but for the most part they send visual gags and verbal punchlines tearing past at an enjoyably demanding speed whipping up the films energy at every turn. That makes it a little frothier than Birds other films but its delectable nonetheless.

So goes the personal mantra of the late celebrity chef Auguste Gusteau whose disembodied spirit materializes -- Jiminy Cricket-style -- to guide the rodent hero of Brad Birds Ratatouille toward his goal of gastronomic excellence. He also seems to be guiding Bird who makes ""cartoons"" -- a cinematic form usually afforded about as much serious artistic credibility as the slasher movie -- but who should be considered one of the most inspired and imaginative storytellers at work in American movies. Not unlike David Chase who managed to craft an existential epic about work death and the American family while toiling in that other subcinematic medium Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation.None of that should come as much surprise to anyone who saw Birds two previous features The Incredibles with its art deco fever dream of a superhero family hiding out in suburbia and The Iron Giant whose titular extraterrestrial robot turned out to be considerably more humane than the flesh-and-blood government agents hot on his trail. Like that movie Ratatouille gives us a non-human being who refuses to accept the roles prescribed to him by man and ratkind.When we first meet young Remy (well voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt) his rarefied palate and exceptional olfactory abilities have reduced him to serving as ""poison sniffer"" for the garbage foraged by his father (Brian Dennehy) his brother and the other members of their colony. But Remy who refuses to walk on his front paws for fear of dirtying them prefers to raid the ""good stuff"" in the kitchen of the elderly Parisian widow whose attic provides the colony with its latest home. Letting his nose guide him he combines fresh fruits and cheeses and spices in an array of exotic combinations. And when Remy bites into some new flavor he experiences a kind of synesthesia ""seeing"" the taste represented as a series of shapes and colors. Then opportunity strikes in the form of forced eviction -- ""Raid"" -- separating Remy from his family and landing him on the doorstep of Gusteaus the eponymous restaurant of Remys favorite chef now reduced to a glorified tourist attraction following the death of its owner and the removal of one of its five stars by the influential food critic Anton Ego (Peter OToole). More on him in a minute.As luck would have it Remys arrival coincides with that of Linguini (Lou Romano) the bumbling string bean-thin son of Gusteaus former girlfriend who comes looking for work and is promptly assigned to garbage duty by the kitchen staffs resident dictator the Napoleonically complicated Skinner (Ian Holm). Linguini too has dreams of cooking up a storm though his efforts in that direction prove unfit even for rodent consumption. But with a little help from a certain four-legged intruder -- who in a wonderful slapstick conceit can control the movement of Linguinis limbs by yanking at the curls atop the humans head -- voila From trash heap to magnifique Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm As has been widely reported the Pixar-produced Ratatouille was begun by another director (Jan Pinkava who receives a somewhat nebulous ""co-director"" credit in the films end titles) and then taken over by Bird well into the development process. That may explain the vestigial presence of certain subplots (including a rather soap-operaish bit about Linguinis paternity) and characters (the gamine cook Colette voiced by Janeane Garofalo whose tentative romance with Linguini never quite catches fire) that dont seem to fully engage Birds interest. Yet the film is unmistakably Birds not least in its focus on the disparity between art and commerce and between those lives confined to ordinariness and those meant for Olympian heights. Like the Incredible family themselves Remy is profoundly conflicted over possessing exceptional abilities in a world that seems to crave mediocrity. (Not for nothing does the movie have Skinner plotting to plaster Gusteaus mug all over a brand of TV dinners.) But the most provocative gesture of Ratatouille is surely its vivid exultation in the pleasures of haute cuisine. Its a slow-food movie for a fast-food nation being distributed by a company known for its McDonalds marketing tie-ins.Ego turns out to be the villain of the piece in more ways than one -- figuratively in the ill-timed hubris that convinces Linguini to believe the puppet can function without its master and literally in the form of its fearsome namesake who lives in a coffin-shaped house and looks like Count Draculas malnourished brother. (It turns out that he refuses to swallow any food that isnt up to his standards.) But lest you think that Bird is taking revenge on some reviewer who did him wrong I should add that Ratatouille culminates in -- of all things -- an explication of the function of criticism that is as eloquently stated as the films celebration of the artist. And just when you think Bird has exhausted his recipe book he pulls off a slapstick climax that combines the sustained restaurant mayhem from Jacques Tatis Playtime with an episode of involuntary memory borrowed from Proust.But fret not parents Bird hasnt made one of those hipster family films that sail over the heads of their intended audience and head straight for the pop-culture savvy of their parents. Ratatouille is as much a feast for the senses as it is food for thought from the dazzling photo-realism of its creatures great and small to the impressionistic views of the City of Lights (here rendered as an even more gilded glittering dream city than in Michael Moores Sicko). And oh the dinners -- delectable soups and sweetbreads and the titular Provencal stew rendered with the consultation of such real-life foodie deities as Thomas Keller and Jean-Claude Vrinat -- which could prompt the kiddies to request a trip to the French Laundry instead of a Happy Meal. Indeed in todays DIY moviemaking culture anyone can direct but only Brad Bird could have made Ratatouille.RATATOUILLE | Written and directed by BRAD BIRD from an original story by JAN PINKAVA JIM CAPOBIANCO and BIRD | Produced by BRAD LEWIS | Released by Walt Disney Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Cooking up a classic - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Cooking up a classicHumor food and Paris blend perfectly in RatatouilleJune 29 2007|By Michael Phillips Tribune movie criticRATATOUILLE The ads for the ravishing new Disney/Pixar feature ""Ratatouille"" spell out the titular dish phonetically (as rat-a-too-ee) a tactic not necessary in last summers marketing and promotion of ""Cars."" This provides a clue as to why writer-director Brad Birds story about a sweet aesthete of a rat who dreams of becoming a chef may not be in for ""Cars""-type action at the box office.Well theres no justice in the world. ""Ratatouille"" may be rated G but its sense of humor is more sly more sophisticated and more interesting than most PG-13 or R-rated comedies at the moment. The film may be animated and largely taken up with rats but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you have never seen a computer-animated feature with this sort of visual panache and detail.The film is also unexpectedly moving in the way it unites all its major characters in their passion for food and the warm feelings that come with it. Bird and his sterling collaborators have created something wholly new here. Its the haute cuisine of contemporary animation. Plus its crazy about Paris the way films such as ""Funny Face"" were crazy about Paris and rarely have you glimpsed more supple and detailed images of a great city and its eccentric inhabitants.""Ratatouille"" is a tale of two young males learning to grow up and make their way in their respective worlds which intersect in clever ways. Remy the rat lives in the French provinces with his dad Django his brother Emile and extended rat clan. The young rats rarefied nose and highly developed palate (""I know what this needs Saffron"") serve the family well in the role of poison detector.A food-finding mission takes the rats into a shotgun-wielding womans farmhouse to tense results. After shooting the rapids of a nearby river -- an exciting scene and not merely in the Ill-wait-for-the-video-game ""Flushed Away"" way -- Remy is separated from his loved ones and finds himself in the City of Light. The famous deceased chef Gusteau appears to Remy in Tinker Bell-like form guiding him along until Gusteau and Fate plunk Remy into the very kitchen of Gusteaus restaurant a former five-star landmark fallen on hard times.The way Remy makes his bones working in the big leagues is one thread of the ""Ratatouille"" story line. Another concerns his relationship with a young human named Linguini a hapless new restaurant employee with a mysterious connection to the founder. Linguinis reluctant mentor in the kitchen is Colette the sole female in a kitchen full of rough characters. Quite by accident Remy turns his human surrogate Linguini into a marionette-like conduit for his culinary magic.The comic set pieces are very impressive but its the way Remy cooks his new pal an omelet early one morning at Linguinis apartment that gives ""Ratatouille"" its heart. This is a busy film that nonetheless knows how to take time for the little things. It is after all French.Younger audiences may have a difficult time tracking the Linguini part of the narrative which has to do with a contested will and the machinations of the head chef Skinner who resembles a pint-size Akim Tamiroff. Writer-director Bird errs I think in making Linguini such a clod. Also hes not memorably voiced; Lou Romano simply isnt in the league of his colleagues spanning everyone from Patton Oswalt as Remy to Brian Dennehys papa rat to Brad Garretts Gusteau to Janeane Garofalos Colette who always seems on the verge of smacking Linguini around. (The movie is encoded to make little boys fall in love with surly French women with fantastic haircuts.) Ian Holm has a sniveling ball voicing Skinner. Best of all is Peter OToole as the viciously influential restaurant critic Anton Ego. Egos Scrooge-like thawing provides the film with its delightful and slightly bittersweet coda.In Birds previous and highly kinetic feature ""The Incredibles"" composer Michael Giacchino whipped up one witty variation on James Bond-style espionage themes after another. To ""Ratatouille"" Giacchino contributes the most delightful musical score of the year. His delicate nimble flute theme for Remy (like Jean-Pierre Rampal on uppers) captures the hectic pace of a rats life and theres a genuinely rhapsodic swell of feeling in the way the orchestral music augments the rooftop view from Linguinis tiny apartment as seen through the eyes of Remy.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesRatatouille keeps it grossJune 29 2007The music man behind RatatouilleFebruary 24 2008Guess whos coming to lunch?June 24 2007An upscale ratatouille even a rat could loveJune 27 2007Pop Quick PicksJune 29 2007Find More Stories AboutRatatouilleBrad BirdTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-06-29/entertainment/0706270762_1_gusteau-ratatouille-remy,200,ratatouille29,ratatouille,chicagotribune

Co-director Jan Pinkavas original idea was sweetly ridiculous - can a naive ambitious rat (baby-eyed Remy charmingly voiced by Patton Oswalt) long inspired by his reading of a famous French chefs recipe book realise his dream to become a chef? This has been turned by its final director Brad The Incredibles Bird into one of the most witty clever gently moral dramatically convincing and visually stimulating family entertainments of the year. The animation is extraordinary too and occasionally breathtaking. Its so enticing in fact that card-carrying anti-anthropomorphists like this reviewer can readily accept its big ask not only a talking rodent but one able to make a celebrity chef out of his hopeless human helpmeet (the docile disaster-zone Linguini voiced by Lou Romano) by jerking his hair from inside his hat like a Pinocchio pulling his masters strings. Its a tribute to the films tonal and directorial control not to mention its sympathy detail intelligence and lack of pretension that such subtextual sub-currents and metaphors - be they the immigrant experience a la American Tail digs at McBurger food ethics or the assignation of artistic credit - never obscure its pleasures. Those pleasures are found in its vivid characters (such as its frightening Snow White-style villain the power-crazed Anton Ego a food critic with the features of a Gothic Will Self and the voice of Peter OToole) richness of ideas and daring sense of fun. A test for tiny tots a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon.

I had such high hopes for Ratatouille and was incredibly disappointed. It wasnt so much the idea of rats preparing food about which I have to agree with Rothkopf; its not a good concept and its more than a little disgusting. It was more the interminable lack of humour and wit that sank this film. Linguini is as irritating as Remy is grating. The rat clan would be an unwelcome distraction from the plot if there was an interesting one to be found. Ratatouille is an overlong uninspired bore of a film.

"Review Ratatouille Is Visually Rich - washingtonpost.com NEWS | LOCAL | POLITICS | SPORTS | OPINIONS | BUSINESS | ARTS amp; LIVING | GOING OUT GUIDE | JOBS | CARS | REAL ESTATE |SHOPPING ); } //--gt; Review Ratatouille Is Visually RichBy CHRISTY LEMIREThe Associated PressFriday June 29 2007; 242 PM-- ""Ratatouille"" may be the first Pixar movie that is so advanced so sophisticated it doesnt feel like it was made for kids.On a fundamental level sure children will probably enjoy watching the animated adventures of Remy a plucky Parisian rat who leaves the colony to pursue his dream of becoming a gourmet chef. Theres some slapsticky physical comedy and writer-director Brad Bird the mastermind behind ""The Incredibles"" keeps things going at a lively engaging clip.But theres nothing silly or childlike about it. If you stop to think about it the main character is experiencing an existential crisis Stay with the family and safely sift through garbage as his rodent ancestors have done for centuries or risk loneliness abject failure and worse _ death _ by chasing after a loftier goal? Heady stuff there.""Ratatouille"" is also visually wondrous in ways that are both lush and intricately detailed in ways that seem to have been tailored more toward grown-up tastes and sensibilities. It would seem that computer-generated technology couldnt get any better but wow _ it just does. The multitude of animators clearly paid close attention to facets of our daily lives that we take for granted knife marks on a cutting board the way raindrops splash when they hit the sidewalk the glow from a street lamp. Sitting through ""Ratatouille"" it doesnt take long for you to forget that youre watching an animated movie and just allow yourself to become immersed in this glorious realism.The filmmakers also have done marvelous things with perspective often allowing us to see what its like through Remys small beady eyes. We feel as if were rushing down a sewer or scampering through walls and underneath serving carts trying to avoid being squished and its thrilling.The plot may be a bit thin though The furry expressive Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt) literally manipulates gangly garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) Cyrano De Bergerac-style into whipping up his culinary concoctions in the kitchen of a once-revered restaurant. Remy hides beneath Linguinis toque yanking his hair every which direction to prompt him to chop flip or stir. They try not to get caught.Maybe it just feels paltry compared to ""The Incredibles"" Birds Oscar winner about a family of superheroes trying to live quietly in suburbia which worked beautifully both as pure entertainment and as a film with something to say. (Here Bird has taken over as director for Pixar animator Jan Pinkava who came up with the idea and gets a story-by credit.)Blissfully though ""Ratatouille"" is free of the kind of gratuitous pop-culture references that plague so many movies of the genre; it tells a story its very much of our world but it never goes for the cheap easy gag _ no jokes about Emeril or ""The Iron Chef.""Even the vocal cast which is indeed star-studded never feels like distracting stunt casting.Brian Dennehy provides the voice of Remys no-nonsense dad Django whos perfectly happy eating trash. Brad Garrett is Gusteau the famous chef who appears to Remy as an apparition and whose restaurant falls from five stars to three after his death. Janeane Garofalo plays the very stern very French Colette the only woman in the kitchen with whom Linguini embarks on a romance. Ian Holm is the scheming diminutive chef Skinner who takes over Gusteaus and wants to use the household name to pump out frozen food.Best of all is Peter OToole as a powerful food critic with the fabulous name of Anton Ego whose office is shaped like a coffin and who looks as if he may fall into one at any moment. OToole is ideally cast his rich British accent making even the most benign offhanded remark sound like condescending condemnation.""Ratatouille"" a Disney Pixar release is rated G.

"Ratatouille | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ratatouille ) Ratatouille (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Brad Bird may be one of the few animated filmmakers working today who understands what the concept of a ""family film"" means. Its something that offers material to viewers of all ages and doesnt lose one group by catering too strongly to another. Following The Iron Giant and The Incredibles Bird has turned his attention to the sewers and kitchens of Paris with Ratatouille. In some ways its an odd subject for a big-budget cartoon. Rats dont make for the most cuddly of animated creatures and the movie spends enough time developing plot that younger children may squirm. Nevertheless while Ratatouille misses the pinnacle achieved by The Incredibles (considered by some to be the best-ever computer animated film) it provides solid entertainment and shows why something like Shrek the Third should be cast aside. In Ratatouille Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) is a culinary wizard of a rat. His senses are so refined that he refuses to eat garbage and is used by others as a ""poison detector"" since he can tell if something is toxic by sniffing it. His desire however is to become a chef and he gets a chance to achieve his dreams when he meets Linguini (Lou Romano) a janitor at Gusteaus a famous Paris restaurant. Hiding under Linguinis chefs hat Remy urges the young man to create dishes of amazing mastery. Like Cyrano de Bergerac Remy pulls the strings and Linguini takes the credit. Soon Gusteaus is the talk of the city and Linguini has captured the heart of the woman of his dreams Colette (Janeane Garofalo). But trouble looms. The chef (Ian Holm) whose position Linguini usurped wants revenge. And powerful food critic Anton Ego (Peter OToole) has decided to have a meal an Gusteaus; on the night of his arrival Remy is nowhere to be found. Flushed Away had no difficulty using rats as main characters largely because they looked much like human beings with a lot of hair. Ratatouille provides us with rodents that while not lifelike are close enough that it could give some phobic viewers a moments pause. Since this is Disney the film emphasizes the creatures ""cute"" aspects - a round pink nose and wide innocent eyes - but theres no mistaking what they are. Ultimately its a lot easier to think about cuddling up next to a penguin than a rat. This is one instance in which the realism of CGI may not be an asset. Ratatouille continues the recent trend of A-level animated pictures raising the visual bar. With human beings looking ever more like their real-life counterparts its becoming increasingly obvious that the future of computer generated animation may know no boundaries. Theres a chase scene during the second half of Ratatouille that takes us through the streets of Paris and onto boats floating on the Seine. This sequence is so exquisite that its almost impossible to believe it was conceived and realized within a computer. The single noteworthy quality of Shrek the Third was its animation and Ratatouille has topped it. (Not that we would expect anything less from Pixar.) Bird has fashioned the movie as a parable about racism and tolerance. The conflict here is between rats and humans and the breakthrough comes when members of each species learn a little about those of the other. Then theres the Cyrano de Bergerac angle which will go over the heads of children (and perhaps some older audience members). While there are no song-and-dance numbers to enrapture kids there are plenty of action sequences and a majority of the comedy is universal enough to tickle the funny bones of viewers of all ages. For the most part the vocal casting relies on actors with generic voices or those who can hide their natural intonations. The exception is Peter OToole who gives ominous depth to the character of Anton Ego (although the visual representation of the critic looks like Christopher Lee as filtered through Tim Burton). This isnt OTooles first role in an animated movie but it may be his most memorable. He also delivers an interesting monologue about critics that could be seen as applying to more than those who review restaurants. At nearly two hours in length Ratatouille demands a longer attention span than most animated movies. (Plus its fronted by a five-minute short Gary Rydstroms delightful ""Lifted."") It rewards those with patience regardless of age. The movie wisely saves its best and most impressive set pieces for the second half whether theyre the aforementioned chase or the sight of hundreds of rats invading a restaurant kitchen. And while Ratatouille isnt specifically about the love of food thats another ingredient Bird has stirred into the pot. Coupled with Surfs Up Ratatouille offers movie-goers a recent rarity back-to-back quality animated family films. It has been years since we have seen something similar and the effectiveness of this movie helps to wash away some of the bad aftertaste left by Shrek the Third. For parents looking to spend time in a theater with their kids or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare Ratatouille offers a savory main course.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Treatment Michael Moores best film yet diagnoses a sick health-care system. Plus Yearning rats thrilling Herzog and an overly burnished Evening. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Weinstein Co.) On June 29 two momentous films will open nationwide Sicko which will radically alter your perspective on health care in this country; and Ratatouille which will radically alter your perspective on rats in the kitchen. A cynic would say theres a better chance of a rodents becoming a professional chef than Americas getting universal health carebut that would underestimate the big bellicose rat at the center of Sicko. Michael Moore is a polarizing figure by which I mean he polarizes me. Hes a blowhard and a national treasure. His methods are suspect yet his work is indispensable. Think of him as a Shakespearean foola court jesterwith the slashing fury of a crusader. When the counterculture imploded in the late seventies the left lost its sense of humor and tools like Rush Limbaugh learned to appropriate its prankster spirit. (The Republicans reinterpreted speaking truth to power as razzing feminists and the liberal media.) At the height of Reagan/Bush I torpor Moores Roger amp; Me reclaimed the lefts antic legacy. But there were questions Was Moore using his camera to bludgeon ordinary people? Did he fudge the chronology? Yes and yes. The oaf was always undermining his own credibility. I tsk-tsked when he turned his 2003 Oscar win into an occasion for grandstanding about the invasion of Iraq He had a point but did he have to be so shrill? Yet in the end he shamed many of us when he called Iraq a war for fictitious reasons. No one had put it more succinctly. Why didnt we rise up? Maybe we will this time. Sicko is Moores best film a documentary that mixes outrage hope and gonzo stunts in the right proportions; that poses profound questions about the connection between health care and work; and that throws an unforgiving spotlight on what is in both senses the elephant in the room. The Bush administration was able to stonewall in the face of Fahrenheit 9/11 but this film will hit the working classeven the Republican working classin the kidneys with a large stick. Who cant relate to this movie? Who hasnt been flabbergasted by an insurers denial of payment? You could find millions of anecdotesand Moore good sensationalist that he is comes up with doozies. Some are ghoulishly amusing a guy who gets two fingers cut off but doesnt have the coverage to have them both reattached is given a choice between his ring finger (12000) and his middle finger (60000). (Figuratively speaking Moore gives the insurance company that middle finger.) A woman who is rushed semiconscious to the hospital after a head-on collisionand denied reimbursement for the ambulance ride on the grounds that it wasnt preapproved. A little girl going deaf qualifies for an implant in one ear but not both until her father threatens to contact Moore and the company calls back saying Good news EveryoneMoore the dad the audiencehas a good chuckle over that. But the laughter is short-lived Moore works his way from the absurd to the poignant (a retired couple loses their home after multiple heart attacks and cancer) to the tragic. Insurance companies deny claims (because say a malignant tumor is not deemed life-threatening) and patients die before the appeals process runs its course leaving behind stricken spouses and children. Its hard to keep from weeping when a mother tells the story of how Kaiser Permanente wouldnt let her little girlwho couldnt breathereceive treatment at a hospital that wasnt one of theirs. She didnt make it to one of theirs. Kaiser Permanente emerges as the supervillain if only because of an astounding 1971 Oval Office recording. On the tape John Ehrlichman convinces a dubious (or drunk) Richard Nixon to go along with Edgar Kaisers scheme to create a for-profit managed-care system on the grounds that hospitals would have incentives to give less care. Thats how the current health-care system all began. Really Moore didnt need to do much besides shine a light on these scoundrels people like ex-congressman Billy Tauzin who proclaims his voice quavering that he loves his mother he loves that old woman and thats why the Congress must pass a senior-citizens drug bill. Once Congress does Billy Tauzin leaves to make millions lobbying for drug companies. A repentant former HMO bigwig Linda Peeno explains to Congress that she owes her success to denying a procedure to a man who could have been saved. Every time you pay out its a loss. Youre not slipping through the cracks says an ex-employee tearfully. Somebody made that crack and swept you into it. Stories this potent dont need whacking emphasis and Moore employs his sorrowful persona sympathy for the neglected befuddlement over why why why this has to be. The second half of Sicko is a travelogue; our reporter shambles up to Canada and over to the U.K. and France to see how people bear under national health carethe dreaded socialized medicine. (Moore has great fun with clips of a lusty Soviet agrarian musical.) He asks a Canadian how much a procedure set him back and receives a look of incredulity. Money? Wheres the billing office in this English hospital? Billing office? For what? How can you French people afford to have kids with all these taxes? Oh the government gives us six months paid maternity leave and a nanny to help with diapers. Moore overdoes the slack-jawed-wonderment thing but the differences are uncanny. Hes in riskier territory when he whisks some folksamong them hobbled ground-zero volunteers denied government assistanceoff to Guantanamo (because its defenders boast of its superior medical care) and (failing to gain entrance) to Havana. It is astounding that in Cuba you can pay a nickel for an inhaler that goes for 120 90 miles north. One suspects however that there are trade-offs in the area of civil liberties. The larger issue in Sicko transcends medicine. Moore argues that Americans take dead-end jobs for health insurance then stay in them because employers have them over a barrel. He says if you transform health care youll remake society for the better. Of course powerful people are willing to pay through the nose to make sure that particular theory never gets tested. Moore doesnt mention one of my favorite TV shows House which is regarded in some quarters as daringly frank because its physician protagonist (the incomparable Hugh Laurie) uses painkillers indiscriminately and insults people. But does that man run tests In an instant he and his team of residents will suit up and perform a cat scan or open someones bowel or do exploratory neurosurgery (theyre very versatile)anything to solve some pesky medical mystery. Given the realities of managed care House might be our cultures most powerful opiate. After Sicko how can we watch it the same way? How can we let our politicians feed us sugar pills? 1 2 Next Share this story...

""Ratatouille"" is delicious. In this satisfying souffle-light tale of a plucky French rodent with a passion for cooking the master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients -- abundant verbal and visual wit genius slapstick timing a soupcon of Gallic sophistication -- to produce a warm and irresistible concoction thats sure to appeal to everyones inner Julia Child. Though the latest crowd-pleaser from ""The Incredibles"" writer-director Brad Bird arguably reps a harder sell than earlier Disney/Pixar toon outings the combo of critical excitement energetic word of mouth and shrewd marketing should make this family-friendly feast a gastronomical success worldwide. After the less than universally admired ""Cars"" Pixars eighth feature sees the Disney-owned toon studio in very fine form and confirms Birds reputation as one of the mediums most engaging storytellers. Compared to his woefully underseen ""The Iron Giant"" and Oscar-winning ""The Incredibles"" ""Ratatouille"" may be smaller in scope but in telling the story of a very smart rat striving to enter the very human world of French haute cuisine it shares with its predecessors an affinity for gifted outsiders seeking personal fulfillment. Pic also extends two of the great themes of ""The Incredibles"" the pursuit of excellence over mediocrity (a standard that has long distinguished Pixar from rivals and imitators) and the importance -- or rather the unavoidability -- of family ties. Remy a thin blue rat who lives with his unruly rodent clan in the French countryside finds himself torn between these two commitments as the film opens. Blessed with unusually sharp senses Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt) is educated cultured and mad about creating his own culinary master-pieces -- the complete opposite of his tubby good-natured brother Emile (Peter Sohn) and gruff dad Django (Brian Dennehy) who are content to wallow in trash and disapprove of Remys all-too-human higher ambitions. After an unfortunate cooking mishap the rats are evicted from their rural nest and forced to escape through the sewers -- where in the first of many nim-bly orchestrated action sequences Remy is separated from his family. He winds up in Paris near a restaurant once presided over by the legendary chef Auguste Gusteau whose populist motto (""Anyone can cook"") rings in Remys ears as he spies longingly on the bustling kitchen activity. One busy evening Remy cant resist sneaking in and spicing up a vat of soup; credit for the delicious dish goes to the poor garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) a clumsy stammering type with no talent for cooking who is immediately ordered by conniving head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) to reproduce his success. While man and mouse experience difficulty communicating at first they ultimately agree to team up a la ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" Linguini can keep his job and Remy can slice and dice to his hearts content. The result is a classic odd-couple comedy in which Linguini and his ""little chef"" must learn to work together avoid discovery and inevitably deal with the internal and external pressures that threaten their unlikely partnership. Among those threats are the kitchens lone female Colette (a tough-talking but tender Janeane Garofalo) whom Linguini inevitably falls for; the up-to-no-good Skinner whos both suspicious and jealous of Linguinis success; and an uber-acerbic restaurant critic aptly named Anton Ego (a sneering Peter OToole) who once ruined Gusteaus reputation. Premise was originally conceived by Jan Pinkava (who left Pixar before the projects completion but is credited here as a co-director) before Bird took over the reins -- a transition that may explain why some of the secondary characters and subplots feel a tad rote particular in the more manic later stretches though the overall execution is never less than involving. But ""Ratatouille"" is at its finest in the kitchen as Remy learns to whip up sauces and sweetbreads while directing Linguinis movements from beneath the latters cap. The joy of artistic creation is both palpable and infectious and Bird and his supremely inventive team of animators and designers respond in kind -- giving viewers a glimpse of mouth-wateringly realistic cuisine one moment dazzling them with some delightfully Keaton-esque slapstick the next. After the superhero spoof of ""The Incredibles"" and the auto anthropomorphism of ""Cars"" the idea of yet another talking-critter toon might strike some auds as overly quaint and familiar. But the last thing ""Ratatouille"" wants to serve up is yet another shrill jabbering pop-culture-referencing menagerie. Under Birds careful direction Remy with his persuasively rat-like movements and meek nods and shrugs delivers one of the more endearing and soulful animal ""performances"" in recent memory. Oswalts dialogue delivery though consistent with the generally superb voicework never dominates the charac-ters expressive range. As ever with Pixar theres the sense that a complex world has been beautifully and minutely imagined from the inside out one where its clear the film-makers have done their homework (what other family movie would bother to explain the meaning of a demie chef de partie?). The entire produc-tion is a captivating visual delight as the fluid shifts between human and rodent perspective and the cameras sensitivity to different gradations of light and color are nothing short of stunning. As an impossibly romantic valentine to the City of Lights pic could give both the recent ""Paris je taime"" and the forthcoming ""2 Days in Paris"" a run for their money. Wide-ranging score by Michael Giacchino (""The Incredibles"") stays perfectly in sync with the action encompassing string- and accordion-based Gallic overtones as well as a light percussion that suggests the scampering of rat paws. Pic is preceded by an amusing Gary Rydstrom-directed short ""Lifted"" which cheekily imagines a drivers ed lesson aboard a UFO.
