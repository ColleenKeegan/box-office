Although it picks up where AVP left off this is not a toned-down futuristic action movie but a gory sci-fi/horror film featuring new incarnations of the extra-terrestrial monsters. Sadly this semi-sequel is even more spasmodic boring and incoherent.After a hybrid Predator-cum-Alien runs amok on a Predator spaceship it crash-lands near a small American town. As the cross-fertilised Predalien slimes its way through the sewers a battle-scarred Predator is sent to clean up the mess. Caught in the cross-fire between the alien antagonists are the disposable wooden townsfolk - played by second-string actors from TV shows such as 24 Rescue Me and ER - whose sole function is to run around like headless chickens until they are gruesomely dispatched. The sheriff is ineffectual so hopes rest with ex-con Dallas (Steve Pasquale) his semi-delinquent brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis) and an aggressively maternal Iraq War veteran Kelly (Reiko Aylesworth) - a poor substitute for Sigourney Weavers Ripley.Scriptwriter Shane Salernos dialogue is unspeakable the visceral horror all too familiar and the ideas distinctly second-hand. Cinematographer Daniel Pearl who shot the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the recent re-make occasionally generates scares by hiding the creatures in dark shadows. But the visual effects-trained Strause brothers know that its all about the last waltz. So the mayhem inevitably culminates in a dance of death featuring the mutant dreadlocked Predalien and a leaner smarter Predator.

First and foremost because of their intelligence. They are not animals. Predator is skilled and can solve problems...and a warrior who only kills for the sake of the battle.. Alien is a fighting machine but not only that they too are intelligent as they learn very quickly and basically want to preserve their race by taking over their environment. I just adore them both...first off..the alien exhibits traits from their hosts which in this case not a face of a predator or even remotely suppose to resemble a predator.. this is what this movie has done wrong. ..unless you happen to find one inside a predator before it bursts through and clone it then this movie is not acceptable to me by having a ""predalien"" (whatever that means). ... As true fans know in Alien 3 in the prison the Aliens host was a dog. Even Ripley noted that it moved different as well as its responses/speed. Same with Aliens that came after the first movie....all Im saying is that Im disappointed. I couldnt see anything the movie had no concept of light what so ever..why who the hell knows. ..all Alien/Predator movies are serious movies and intelligent movies..works of art that in the end the viewer respects the Alien and Predator. I dont know what the people who made this movie were trying to do but for fans as serious as I am and if you are a serious fan you know what Im talking about here this movie pissed me off..and btw a lone Predator coming to earth to stop this ""predalien"" is not what Predators would actually do. Predators would travel in threes for something as serious as this with a ship nearby to make sure the job was done. ..I am so disappointedFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 25 2010andrewFeaturedMight have been a good film bu they may as well have just made it a radio program or talking book since i couldnt see a thing for most of the film cos the cameraman must have forgotten to take the lens cap off. either that or the film producers are idiots thinking it would be a good idea to make the film so dark I got a headache from straining to view it even with the contrast and brightness optimised. a potentially good film made rubbish and a complete waste of my money.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 12 2008DanFeaturedCan someone please explain how the Predator can travel from its home world to earth IN A DAY? Wouldnt it have made more sense for the distress signal to have been sent to the mother ship in orbit? One more thing when they get round to making AvP3 could the directors (hopefully someone new) please TURN ON THE LIGHTS so we can see what the hell is going on? Jeeeeez.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 20 2008Tin TinFeaturedDue to the fact that my 6 year old son will not sit still for more than 3 seconds I did not get to see this movie at the cinema................I did however purchase the single disc version from Asda today and it is going straight back for a refund in the morning..............I dont know if it was just the DVD version but it was so dark that I could not make a single thing out whatsoever in fact  I was straining to see the picture so much that it gave me an headache..................I ended spending most of the movie fidddling with the contrast and brightness levels to no avail.............I dread to think what would happen if someone were to buy a APS1500 LCD TV and played this as their first movieFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 7 2008AsifFeaturedAVP-R one of the best movie I like only the technology use by a Predator.

I would be ashamed to be the director of this film. Not one of the human characters are believable or relatable. Why would you cast such a horrible crew? Im a fan of both alien and predator film and justice hasnt been served. The movie itself was way too dark. Im not talking about scary dark. I mean you could barely see shit. The action was cut way too fast. As a consumer I want detail I want to see scars sweat blood chipped teeth. I want to see a dude getting his head ripped off at half speed not a glimpse of a neck then a tail then a shot of the floor. Its do or die time buddy Some horror movies can get away with showing somthing scary get close to somone then pan away as the real shit goes down. I get it Leaving somthing to the imagination can be even scarier. Not here Putting the predator music on whenever you showed him might have worked out too but once again no dice. Oh yeah one predator is retarded. In avp werent there multiple preds that were fucked up by normal aliens? These are supposed to be hybrids man While on that note you tried too hard in creating the pred alien. Ive seen scarier shit in Harry and the Hendersons. No doubt you made a grip of cash making this movie but at what cost? Letting the world know that character colaberations will never work out? I spent one dollar on renting this movie and its sad to say I want it back. Im not saying dont make anymore Im just saying make a good one AVP was pointed in the right direction even though it still could of used a bit of work. Were you just trying to clean up at the box office or what? This film could have made a dent in movie history but you kinda fucked that shit up huh. Its pretty bad that Rob Zombe is the only one thats been tearing shit up lately Oh you cant leave out Tarantino hes always been a crafty sob. I guess all Im saying is try harder next time. If you let me down that means there are millions of others that feel the same way I do.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 9 2008joker RamirezFeaturedbest moive Ive seen sence i came to LA It great come out with a nother moive like predator 3 or alien 5 keep making sci-fi moives u guys rock.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 9 2008joker RamirezFeaturedbest moive Ive seen sence i came to LA It great come out with a nother moive like predator 3 or alien 5 keep making sci-fi moives u guys rock.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 9 2008steven a ramirezFeaturedTHe movie is great I like that they pick different people when does it come out tell me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 9 2008steven a ramirezFeaturedTHe movie is great I like that they pick different people when does it come out tell me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 25 2008jtFeaturedHeres what i say. see the the film if you dont like it thats fine if you do like it thats fine too.despite the bad reviews I personaly liked this film.

There is a teasing glimpse at the beginning of (one of?) the predator home world(s) but the rest is just not interesting with to my mind a formulaic and simply or predictable plot the acting isnt up to much either. From previous comments I understand this may have been based on a comic book shame they did not choose a better one. If you thought that Doom the movie was more fun than the game it was based on then this film is probably well suited to you. Hoping that this does not nail the lid down on A or P unless of course the next outing is even worse. Not worth the entry fee it will be on TV soon enough.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 2 2008mattFeaturedI thoght its the best yet with a great ending so go see AVPRFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 2 2008mattFeaturedI thoght its the best yet with a great ending so go see AVPRFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 2 2008mleeFeaturedThought the film was very good.

(where do ya start?) - its... well... QUITE SHIT REALLY - the acting... its appalling The actors are crap like theyve just been plucked at random from deal or no deal for god sake. - wastes 2 hours or so of your life and APS6.00 of ya hard earned cash - pretty much goes against the legacy the old alien and pred films created. - makes you wanna kill yourself if youre a fan of the legendary originals. - the ending leaves it wide open for yet another avp film (oh please no... when will it end?) - Predalien? what a gay name - Script is like its been written by a guy who spends every day of his life sat in a chair eating toast and playing halo. its shocking.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 29 2008DanielFeaturedI enjoyed it but was dissappointed in the briefness of the alien-predator fights. I was dissappointed it wasnt set in the future and that they drafted in completely unknown actors/actresses who have about as much acting talent as a toaster. Some nice effects but the story was predictable and not apocalyptic enough why cant the aliens winFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 29 2008richardFeaturedWhat a dire ending Ok so the script was lame as a dodgy donkey and the acting reminiscent of Babe i.e pure ham Absolutely gutted and feel ripped off at APS6.20 couldve got a few beers with the money. that wouldve been better..probably..FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 28 2008RobParryFeaturedWhat have they done??...I loved the Alien and Predator films.. I got all excited at AVP1 until I learnt it was set in a pyramid under Antarctica (of course?) but at least in that film you could see what was going on... And the fight scenes were half decent and styled.. With AVPR theyve just ruined it completely... which is a shame as I was really looking forward to it after seeing the bloodied trailers.. Its like a cross between Dawsons Creek and the X files with a few aliens and a Predator thrown in.... Its in darkness for half the film flashes from cut scene to cut scene like an MTV video and makes no sense whatsoever??.... But the bit that really dissapointed me was the ending. Youd expect some grand finale between the Predalien and Predator...... What you get is just pathetic..... simply pathetic..... and then the very end which is meant to leave it open for AVP3 (Please no...) is just laughable........... Dig out the DVDs of Predator1 and Aliens and then argue amongst yourelves which is the better film... thats the only way youll have an entertaining Alien vs Predator film experience.................FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 28 2008Laurren DFeaturedwelll.... after watt ppl toldd me about dis film i thoughtt u wuddd goo watch itt it was grimmm mostlyyy all dahh wayy though iff urr a girlyy girl it anit forrrr yoooh loool i was disapointed in dahh actula story lineeee it was lameeeeeee ... buttt in someee partsss there is goodd bitsss PFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 28 2008kennyFeaturedthe worst film i have possibly seen in my life. they should have called it alien vs human because there were hardly any alien vs predator fight scenes and its a good job i got in the cinema for free because i would want my money backFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 27 2008JPREFeaturedAwful awful awful.

Please.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 27 2008jayFeaturedboring waste of time. The 1st one is much betterFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 27 2008DomFeaturedHaving watched this film is like getting changed back into ones clothes after a swim in the local swimming baths and finding out that instead of ones own socks one has put on each foot the bad smelling socks of a dozen other people. I am a great fan of the Alien movie series but this movie is entirely boring the characters are banal theres no intelligence to the movie that would satisfy fans of the the Alien movie. I think it might satisfy some people brought up on computer games. The Predalien creature although well sculpted by Steve Wang I didnt like the head design or how the structure was built to accommodate a man of typical size like most of the Gillis and Woodruff alien suits and the film was so dark and none of the intricate details on the suit could be seen. I really didnt like having to sit through this movie. The film on the cinema does not appear to be a shortened version of the directors vision so I suppose well have to wait to see the DVD edition to see if there is anything more to the film but Im not going back into the cinema to watch that piece of crud again. However with the failure to create credible alien suits comparable to the original alien creature in Alien the Predator suit was very good and they had a performer of very much above normal height to play this character. The script writer ought to be fired and the film production team ought to be given better pre-production time especially to get the aliens right. I know that the directors would have loved to have re-biomechanised all the alien warriors but didnt have the time or budget to do this so they focused on getting the Predalien designed as well as possible which does actually show on the final Predalien suit when shown in the light although the basic design isnt of my choice and so on etc...etc...etc.. etc..FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 27 2008sean kellyFeaturedid love to get my hands on the dounut who wrote the time out review im sure he was still watching avp1(avp1 was shocking bye the way) im a huge fan of the alien and predator films and this one was top draw very different than the others but in a good way. really entertaining. dont think people who arnt into the previous films will like it alot though. hope this helpsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 27 2008sean kellyFeaturedid love to get my hands on the dounut who wrote the time out review im sure he was still watching avp1(avp1 was shocking bye the way) im a huge fan of the alien and predator films and this one was top draw very different than the others but in a good way. really entertaining. dont think people who arnt into the previous films will like it alot though. hope this helpsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/85003/avpr-aliens-vs-predator-requiem.html,200,alienvs.predator0,alienvs.predator,timeout

As the second round of an earthbound smackdown between two iconic extraterrestrials ""Aliens vs. Predator -- Requiem"" provides enough cheap thrills and modest suspense to shake a few shekels from genre fans before really blasting off as homevid product. Slightly more graphic but appreciably less atmospheric than its PG-13 predecessor -- an upscale B-movie that offered the long-awaited monster match-up previously rendered only in vidgames and comicbooks -- the R-rated sequel likely will play best with auds who have little familiarity with or reverence for earlier installments in the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchises. Picking up precisely where ""Alien vs. Predator"" left off scripter Shane Salerno has the ferocious product of an Alien-Predator mating (a Predalien?) destroying all fellow passengers aboard a Predator spaceship then crash-landing in the woods near the small Colorado community of Gunnison. With easy access to human breeding vessels the mutant beastie (imagine the Mother Alien from ""Aliens"" with a wicked set of dreadlocks) immediately begins using hunters homeless vagrants restaurant employees and other unfortunates for procreation purposes. In no time at all chests are bursting entrails are splattering Alien offspring are rampaging and bit players are rashly assuring loved ones that never mind the noise theres really nothing bad lurking outside. Eventually a super-duper Predator arrives on the scene to enforce some population control. But as this intergalactic Mr. Fix-It goes about doing the dirty work of trapping and destroying all trace of the Alien multitudes often resembling an ace player in a first-person shooter vidgame the local citizenry gets caught in the crossfire. Chief among those in danger of becoming collateral damage Morales (John Ortiz) the upstanding but outmatched local sheriff; Dallas (Steven Pasquale) an ex-con who doesnt take any guff from either extraterrestrial species; and Kelly (Reiko Aylesworth) a resourceful Iraq War vet whose maternal instincts and straight-shooting heroics recall the mother of all ""Alien"" franchise heroines Sigourney Weavers Ellen Ripley. Directed by vet f/x wizards Colin and Greg Strause -- first-time feature helmers who bill themselves as naturally the Brothers Strause -- ""AVP-R"" moves at a reasonably brisk clip even while marking time between slam-bang horror-action setpieces. Especially effective and ingeniously creepy is a maternity-ward sequence thats bound to creep out expectant mothers in the audience. Occasionally the filmmakers reveal a cheeky willingness to upend genre conventions particularly when bending the rules regarding who lives and who dies in this sort of pic. But they may be a tad too clever for their own good while springing a sequel setup in the final scene the meaning of which will be lost on anyone who isnt intimately familiar with arcane aspects of the ""Alien"" mythos. The actors have little to do here but hit their marks say their lines and not bump into each other when the script doesnt call for it. Production values are on the level of a better-than-average direct-to-vid production or a Sci Fi Channel telepic though the editing in a few battle scenes tends to confuse rather than excite.

Not psychologically dark; dark dark as in not very generously lighted.The first film took place largely underground in Antarctica. The new one which opened Tuesday first finds itself in the sewers of a Colorado town where the title um characters are doing battle. And then after the intergalactic struggle moves to the local power plant the electricity for the whole region is knocked out. Bring your night-vision goggles to this one.You might wonder if the shadowiness is a subtle admission of shame ""We dont want anyone looking too closely at this thing."" But ""Requiem"" as the new film is subtitled has nothing to be ashamed of. It may not be classic sci-fi like the original ""Alien"" which it has in its DNA but its a perfectly respectable next step in the series.Reiko Aylesworth from ""24"" and Steven Pasquale from ""Rescue Me"" provide some acting cred as two residents of a small town in which a spaceship crash-lands. The film doesnt seem interested in drawing any new fans to the series because it doesnt bother to provide any back story but heres the gist of it The predators from the ""Predator"" films hunt the aliens of the ""Alien"" films using Earth as a sort of practice range because the aliens breed inside humans.The first film ended with a new wrinkle An alien bred inside a dead predator. As ""Requiem"" opens the hybrid hatches aboard a predator space ship all heck breaks loose and the crash-landing is the result. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Another predator is dispatched to Earth to track down the aliens which have escaped from the crashed ship and are busily suction-cupping onto the faces of every Coloradoan in sight.Greg and Colin Strause the directors and Shane Salerno the screenwriter give the humans in the story much more attention than they received in the first film which makes for a far more watchable movie. The story is fairly generic try-to-get-away stuff but its decently rendered. There are a couple of classic horror-film bits in among the sci-fi -- oh you young people dont you know that skinny dipping attracts malevolent creatures? -- and even one pretty funny joke.There is also a nice life-or-death choice for the survivors go await a promised airlift or go with the resourceful Ms. Aylesworth to look for a helicopter? Robert Joy is a perfect low-key villain in military guise.""Aliens vs. Predator Requiem"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence gore and salty language.
