This wannabe blockbuster salivates over the latest fighter-jet technology as crack pilots Josh Lucas Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx are joined in formation by a gleaming new high-tech un-manned aircraft dubbed EDI - or Extreme Deep Invader. Cue yards of CGI fly-boy action explosions and the creeping suspicion youre watching a widescreen demo for some flight-simulator video game. Top Gun for the digital generation then? Not quite actually since 70s-generation screenwriter WD Richter subverts the gung-ho visuals with a strong note of caution. Richter makes hawkish commander Sam Shepard the villain for fast-tracking the development of this robo-jet. The jet is empowered to kill without employing the human conscience displayed by our heroes in the pilots seat who fret over innocent casualties and collateral damage as the war on terror takes to the skies above Burma and Pakistan. Fascinating for its ideological tensions its pretty ho-hum as supposed thrill-rides go since the impressive but oddly academic effects can do little to enliven the cardboard leads. Base to Jamie Foxx youre far too good for this schtick By TJ Details Release details Rated 12A Release date Friday August 5 2005 Duration 120 mins Cast and crew Director Rob Cohen Screenwriter WD Richter Cast Josh LucasJessica BielJamie FoxxSam ShepardJoe MortonRichard Roxburgh Users say Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/81609.html,200,stealth0,stealth,timeout

"Bombs Away washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Bombs Away Jet set Jamie Foxx Jessica Biel and Josh Lucas play fighter pilots who make things go boom as they fight a demon computer. (By Jasin Boland -- Columbia Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 29 2005 Remember the rocket-ship sounds you used to make as a kid? You built up a nice sloppage of phlegm and saliva deep in your throat you sort of funnelized your mouth at an oblique angle with a little loose lip muscle for a vibratory undertone and then propelled a gust of breath out through the glop and upward with two lungs worth of force. Pccccchhhhhhhhhhkkkkowwwwwwwwwwww is how its spelled although Websters New Third has two more hs and one fewer w. Also there is some dispute among scholars as to the correct number of exclamation points. At any rate ""Stealth"" is one big Pccccchhhhhhhhhhkkkkowwwwwwwwwwww of a movie. Thats all it is. A kids rocket-ship sound for about two hours some vapid people standing around trying to look interested and a lot of unlikely computer-animated aircraft violating the laws of gravity on the screen. I kept ducking in the belief that with all that Pccccchhhhhhhhhkkkkkowwwwing going on up there surely gallons of atomized spit vapor would come spritzing in my direction. The director is Rob Cohen whos a kind of low-rent Don Siegel; that is he makes fast crude films without much in the way of finesse counting on the enthusiasm of the actors to hustle the thing through the idiocies of plot and possibly hoping that like Siegel come three decades from now critics will remember him as a great artist. It wont happen. Hes not. What he understands is what sells tickets His last two speed machines were ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""XXX."" Now hes trying to make a hit -- not a movie you understand but a hit -- without Vin Diesel. And he chooses . . . Josh Lucas? That guy who looks like Matthew McConaughey after too many spins in a dryer? Yep thats whom he chooses. And youre telling me hes smart? On the other hand Cohen somehow got Jamie Foxx to sit still for a supporting role after two Oscar noms in the same year. Perhaps the deal was struck before fame came calling for him. If not though the question must be asked Whos agenting Foxx? ""Jamie heres a great opportunity to cash in. You play the Noble Yet Comic African American Teammate Who Dies Early On while some wimpy white guy nobody ever heard of gets all the good lines"" Memo to Jamie Foxx New agent big guy Anyhow as Cohen sets it up from a script by W.D. Richter Lucas Foxx and Jessica Biel (quick Alphonse check her for a pulse) play three hotshot naval aviators who are picked to fly a new super-smart fighter off carriers and deliver smart bombs down terrorist chimneys somewhere -- or anywhere -- in the Third World. But a fourth plane joins them. Its pilot is . . . a computer. This is a hoary old shake dating back at least as far as ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" where it was handled brilliantly as all who remember the psycho computer HALs bland assuring treacherous voice can remember The Machine With a Mind of its Own. The same idea has driven films as disparate as ""The Terminator"" ""WarGames"" and ""Saturn 3."" Its not new. Its not interesting. I wish it would go away. Well theres a mild wrinkle in ""Stealth"" it must be admitted. Its not a big one but lets give a little credit where due The final alliance that triumphs over evil is somewhat surprising as is the identity of that evil. Give Cohen two points. No no thats too many. Give him one point. The movie alternates among three realities One is a control room where technicians sit in the dark looking at glowing screens and uttering lines like ""Falcon Three-Five I have you vectored on a three-oh-seven heading."" Then theres a little liberty sequence where the three amigos get to go to clubs or tour the Asian countryside in their dress whites exchanging no-brainer dialogue. The rest is pure cartoon. You watch video-game flying machines whiz through painted mountain valleys or down urban corridors as various castles buildings or armored vehicles blow up in miniature the soundtrack is Pcccccchhhhhhhhkkkkkkowwwwing the bejeepers out of your inner ear your balance is slipping and youre wondering Is Biel mechanical? She sure is attractive but all the testosterone floating in the air seems to have caused her to hammer her performance into a little ball. Theres a final troubling issue. I understand its only a movie and that nobody really got killed. But as this film plays out its endgame it pretty much runs out of villains and so it stumbles to locate surrogates. Thus it settles on the North Koreans. I am no fan of North Korea as who would be but one of Kim Jong Ils masseuses? Still the movie concocts an escape-extraction gambit where Lucas has to nab Biel from the evil commie North Koreans. This involves a lot of killing. Really was this trip necessary? As the Asian hordes fall to the guns of the Westerners I kept thinking Theyre not terrorists or poachers or drug dealers or kiddie-porn makers or any other class of okay-to-kill modern villains. Theyre simply officers and men of their countrys army doing their duty following their orders. They dont deserve even in fantasy the mass slaughter dealt them by uncomprehending pretty American movie kids who couldnt make a bed if they had to. Stealth (117 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for computerized violence cursing and sexual innuendo.

As similarly a silly semi-sci fi actioner as Bays ""The Island"" and with Jamie Foxx relegated to a backup position ""Stealth"" probably wont stay airborne for too long. Aiming to join the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of American movie war games ""Stealth"" is just too dumb to make the grade. Director Rob Cohens fifth high-speed production with producer Neal H. Moritz (""XXX"" ""The Fast and the Furious"") turns near-future Air Force jets guided by artificial intelligence into objects for thrill rides and nearly erotic pleasure while warning of a corrupt Pentagon at the core. As similarly a silly semi-sci fi actioner as Bays ""The Island"" and with Jamie Foxx (thesping here before his Oscar win) relegated to a backup position ""Stealth"" probably wont stay airborne for too long. Pic launches in an old-fashioned manner establishing the tight relationship of crewmates Lt. Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas) Lt. Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) and Lt. Henry Purcell (Foxx). Trio which reports to stern craggy-faced Capt. George Cummings (Sam Shepard) was chosen from a field of naval air candidates to fly the latest brand of stealth fighters designed to instantly respond to sightings of terrorists anywhere in the world. Although detail of Cummings political allies in Washington is briefly inserted and revisited from time to time pics action essentially rubber-stamps the belief that U.S. air power can and will attack any point on the planet. Once the crew is greenlit for duty on the USS Abraham Lincoln Cummings surprises them with the introduction of a robotic fighter jet nicknamed ""EDI."" The pilot-less craft EDI can fly and drop payloads without human emotion getting in the way. Test flight with this added ""wingman"" turns into a full-blown attack on a downtown Rangoon high-rise where an international terrorist cell is housed. Gannon proves he can pull the attack off solo without EDIs aid but alas on the return to base EDI is zapped by a lightning bolt triggering some erratic behavior. ""Stealth"" mimics the Hal plot from ""2001"" in a way that falls uneasily between good-natured spoof and tribute. Besides the three-letter moniker Wentworth Millers slightly effeminate tone as EDIs voice copies Douglas Rains vocal performance as HAL. The idea that the computer gains a mind of its own is also repeated here and even a scene where two concerned guys try to conceal themselves from EDI while talking about him echoes the pre-intermission climax of Kubricks sci fi masterwork. After a Bruckheimeresque Ramp;R sidetrip to Thailand where Gannon and Wade declare they have the hots for each other without so much as a smooch the trio is back with EDI. Ignoring Wades order to back off from bombing a nuclear-armed terrorist camp in Tajikistan EDI goes on the attack leaving the humans no choice but to join in. ""Stealth"" distastefully visualizes the resulting radioactive cloud as a briefly seen visual effect and though its on course to poison large swathes of the Near East all the way to Pakistan this fact is ignored for the rest of the movie. Instead story focuses on EDI vs. crew with Purcell easily dispatched (making this one of Foxxs most thankless roles) and Wades plane damaged enough that she must eject over North Korea. For five minutes pic is genuinely astonishing in its detailed visceral and stratospheric depiction of Wades plummeting to the ground in a damaged parachute. As Wade tries to elude capture (with pic borrowing from ""Behind Enemy Lines"") the rest of ""Stealth"" is taken over by Lucas Gannon as he tries to wrest control and have EDI re-wired by his slickster Seattle-based creator Keith Orbit (Richard Roxburgh). For pic to tie story in with Washington politics actual science or authentic military strategy adds a false veneer of seriousness to whats really an expensive CGI-stoked war movie. With characters barely sketched the movies moral concerns are less important than visual effects supervisor Joel Hyneks teeth-rattling skill at projecting cool weapons doing major damage. Lucas shifts out of his usual supporting bad-guy stints but he makes Gannons self-confidence look almost snide. Biel impresses most when talking less and running more. Shepard does better in his other life as a playwright. As Cohens films continue to grow pricier theyre both more and more humorless while looking more technically impressive and he enjoys fine support with ace technicians like Hynek lenser Dean Semler and production designers J. Michael Riva and Jonathan Lee. Techno music vet BT delivers a stiff military score liberally quoting from Hans Zimmer.

Directed by Rob Cohen from a screenplay by W.D. Richter. 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense action some violence brief strong language and innuendo. Several theaters. Rob Cohens airborne adventure ""Stealth"" commits the cardinal sin for an action movie Its very very dull. You dont need to take my word for it; just ask the gentleman sitting to my right at the preview screening last week. During the films supposedly very exciting finale with planes swooping around and things exploding and music clashing and Jessica Biels hair getting a bit mussed I heard a strange sound -- not coming from the screen -- and turned my head to investigate. Yes it was a snore. So is most of ""Stealth"" with the exception of a comically calm-voiced artificial intelligence pilot/robot (he sounds like a cross between HAL from ""2001"" and an especially pleasant therapist) and a brief dignified cameo appearance by the Space Needle. The plot as much as it matters in this video game of a movie involves three elite U.S. Navy pilots played picturesquely by Biel Josh Lucas and Jamie Foxx. They are joined in their terrorist-fighting endeavors by an experimental new ""wingman"" -- a UCAV (unmanned combat aerial vehicle) known as EDI or Eddie. In the course of the film we learn a lot of things such as that female elite Navy pilots keep lots of pretty lingerie on clotheslines in their tiny rooms on the aircraft carrier that getting lost in North Korea is a very bad idea and that 3 is a prime number. (Prime numbers are of course carefully defined for us -- heaven forbid this movie assume that its audience knows anything.) A mysterious figure (Richard Roxburgh) is revealed who lives in Seattle (hence the Needles star turn). He has a sexy miniskirted British assistant as everyone in Seattle does and his name provides the movies only punch line Keith Orbit. All of this silliness is punctuated by a lot of video-game-like action sequences with our heroic pilots zooming around like theyre late to a frat party. And no sooner do we get accustomed to the cozy threesome when three becomes a crowd -- never mind about prime numbers. One cast member vanishes so suddenly that you wonder what siren call (of perhaps a better movie shooting elsewhere?) was heard. Director Cohen attempts distraction by putting Biel in a bikini or cutting back to boss men Sam Shepard and Joe Morton having a sort of territory-marking contest back at headquarters but nothing holds our interest in terms of story or character -- just two very long hours. Theres nothing wrong with making a silly action movie but this one just feels lazy. And it attempts unearned relevance by invoking real tragedy solemnly reminding us of ""the mounting threat of terrorism"" in its opening title card. ""I dont think war should be some kind of video game"" says Lucas midway through the story. Indeed.

The only highlight is a backstabbing computer named Eddie. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Stealth Science-fiction thriller. Starring Josh Lucas Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Rob Cohen. (PG-13. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Rob Cohen is a mature director with a resume that goes back 30 years but he directs movies as though he were an unnaturally skillful 16-year-old -- and thats not a bad thing. His camera is always moving (but it doesnt fidget). He matches graceful technique with a restless eye and if theres a way to pump up an action an emotion a stunt or an explosion he finds it. It was Cohens relentlessness as much as Vin Diesels cool that made the first ""xXx"" and ""The Fast and the Furious"" two of the best popcorn movies of the decade. But alas even Julia Child couldnt make whipped cream out of water and no matter how hard Cohen flogs it whips it beats it shakes it kicks it and prods it with a sharp stick ""Stealth"" his latest just doesnt spring to life. The problem is the screenplay -- not the dialogue because dialogue hardly matters in a movie like this but the story the premise the characters the whole conception. The movie takes three ill-defined and rather uninteresting fighter pilots establishes a friendship between them thats a matter of complete indifference to the audience and then has the trio playing second banana to a computer. The computer has the best role. Its a sci-fi movie but its also in a sense a war movie one that suffers from an ambivalence thats a reflection of the times. For better or worse these are not the confident gung-ho 80s nor are these the cynical disillusioned anti-war 70s. In ""Stealth"" the fighter pilots carry out precision bombing raids in the war on terror and while they believe in what theyre doing they dont ever quite know whom theyre fighting. They worry about ""collateral damage"" and political fallout and say things like ""I dont think war should become a video game."" Its a curious case ""Stealth"" though simpleminded in almost every conceivable way is identifiably a product of a complicated era. Josh Lucas Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx play Ben Kara and Henry respectively three stealth fighter pilots who work as a team. Theyre sent on an elite mission where they find out from their commanding officer (Sam Shepard) that theyre getting a new wingman who turns out not to be human but a highly advanced computer named Eddie. Eddie can fly a plane and he can also talk -- in a polite calm voice reminiscent of HAL the rogue computer in ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" Never trust a polite computer. They sound peaceful and reasonable but thats just an act they put on to cover their real plans in this case to bomb Russia for absolutely no reason. Yes Eddie has some weird ideas. All this of course gives Cohen an opportunity to roll out the spectacular aerial shots. Yet its astonishing what little impact even the most imaginatively choreographed and well-filmed aerial escapades can have when theyre presented as neither an expression of a characters personality nor in the context of a compelling mission. The three principals cant make anything of their roles because they are co-starring in ""Bedtime for Bonzo"" with Eddie as Bonzo. That is he gets to have all the fun while they get to follow him around act serious and clean up his mess. Even when the movie goes off in other directions it doesnt recover. It just becomes more and more extreme unfocused and ridiculous. One of the films centerpieces has a pilot falling out of the sky dodging fiery debris and trying to make a safe landing with a parachute on fire. It starts out exciting and then goes on for so long that it becomes unintentionally funny like something out of a slapstick cartoon. The actors are decorative. They dont bother anybody. Occasionally they inspire pity not for their characters but for themselves. Biel does a lot of crawling through mud for example. That couldnt have been fun. As for Foxx hes completely wasted. In a couple of scenes he puts on a pair of dark sunglasses but at no point does he sit down at a piano and there are no Ray Charles songs on the ""Stealth"" soundtrack. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

If its ""Stealth"" - this weeks contender for the summers action-flick championship belt - the answer turns out to be a jet roar of a ""yes."" Adrenaline-hustler Rob Cohen and writer W.D. Richter pepper their exuberant celebration of speed military hardware and the sexy heat of guys (and a gal) in uniform with timely instances of ambivalence and ambiguity. Sure they lean heavily on the story of an artificially intelligent fighter jet run amok to pose the harder questions. But when it comes to warfare technologys promises and failings are part of the picture. The movie begins with the Navys three best test pilots - Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas) Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) and Henry Purcell (a pre-Oscar Jamie Foxx) - learning their commander has recruited a fourth wingman. Only this one isnt sporting a nickname like ""Goose"" or ""Iceman."" EDIs a quantum-processing Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle. A top-secret prototype with a conscience of chip code and wires EDI was created by a Seattle-based brainiac with the unlikely name of Keith Orbit (Richard Roxburgh). On EDIs first run championed by Capt. George Cummings (Sam Shepard) the stealth pilot performs admirably. But when ""hes"" rattled by a jolt of lightning on the way back to the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln his AI mind gets blown. Cummings pushes EDI back online and into a mission over the qualms of a computer programmer and the aircraft carriers commander (Joe Morton). But that bolt has got EDI thinking like a maverick. ""Casting casting casting"" could be the power mantra of ""Stealth."" In addition to the three appealing leads Shepard brings understated finesse to Cummings. He could easily have collapsed into a full-on baddie. Shepard takes him to his dark places with an unabated steadiness usually reserved for the flawed protagonists of Greek tragedies. Trailers for ""Stealth"" threatened a juiced ""Top Gun"" wannabe. Bigger badder FX; same flyboy antics. But ""Stealth"" proves the child of ""Top Gun"" had to grow up faster than Daddy. The world feels much hotter than it did in 1986 when the Cold War was cooling and Mavericks need for speed was its own raison detre. ""Stealth"" intentionally mixes mildly heady (cmon its summer) dialogue about the philosophies of war with chilly military euphemisms like ""tasking"" and ""prosecuting targets."" When Biels character calculates what the collateral damage of a mission might be theres a reason. Three reasons actually Gulf Wars 1 and 2 plus Afghanistan. When EDI goes ballistic the first time her calculations prove miserably true. If Cummings stands as the militarys honorable but dangerous past Wade turns out to be its conscientious future. Theres a simmer between Wade and Gannon. And one scene between the two gives Gannons hound-dog side a back story. But ""Stealth"" never weighs its characters down with deep backgrounds. Its as if the world has become too urgent a place for ""Top Guns"" Oedipal dramas. Here the love story is more a yearning tale albeit one with a coarse but great last line. At times ""Stealth"" feels like a feature-length recruiting film. What teen wouldnt want to join up after watching the threesome toast each other in a sleek bar their white uniforms gleaming their martinis just as crisp their loyalty to each other undeniable. (Tune into Stephen Bochcos FX series ""Over There"" for an alternative if fictional reality check.) But ""Stealth"" performs a more interesting service. It provides ample evidence of the things we desperately wish were true. Before EDI becomes the mission the quartet of jets heads for a hit on a terrorist confab. As they near the city their computers spit out picture-perfect confirmations of each terrorists identity and location. If only. Hollywood hokum? Absolutely. Pop-culture propaganda? Perhaps. Yet ""Stealth"" goes beyond feeding our popcorn proclivities. It provides glossy evidence of our unfulfilled desire to be unerringly decent in imperfect situations.

"Stealth cant hide a major flaw - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Stealth cant hide a major flaw By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 29 2005 Stealth"" is a pretty fair military-hardware action movie until you start thinking about it -- at which point it turns incredibly sour in your mouth. I can therefore recommend it to any and all audiences lacking higher brain functions. Sea cucumbers perhaps. Ones waving American flags.I certainly cant recommend it to fans of Jamie Foxx because the best actor Oscar winner for Ray"" is stuck in the deeply secondary role of the heros best friend. Since Stealth"" was filmed before the Academy Awards Foxx can take some solace in the fact that he wont ever have to accept this kind of jive part again.As for Josh Lucas and Jessica Biel as Navy stealth-fighter jet pilots in love with flying and (in a dont-ask-dont-tell sort of way) each other they exhibit markedly less personality than EDI (pronounced Eddie"") the unmanned computerized drone plane that has just become the fourth member of their elite squadron. EDI speaks in the friendly metallic tones of HAL 9000s grandson and hes equipped with the latest advances in artificial intelligence. Artificial or not this gives him a leg up on everyone in the film.Lieutenants Ben Gannon (Lucas) Kara Wade (Biel) and Henry Purcell (Foxx) are not happy about bringing Robo-plane along on their tactical missions but the project is the baby of their commanding officer Captain George Cummings (Sam Shepard) who has that win-at-all-costs evil glint in his eye. W.D. Richters script even makes a feint toward ethical debate I just dont think war should become a video game"" says Ben upon which Cummings reminds him about the body bags. A scene or two later Kara insists that if its programmed by moral people itll be moral"" but since she subsequently announces she has to go pee-pee"" mature strategic analysis may not be the characters strong suit.Anyway such conundrums are moot since the director is Rob Cohen of XXX"" and The Fast and the Furious"" and he has stuff to blow up. After the squadrons successful strike on a terrorist cell in Rangoon EDI is hit by lightning has its AI scrambled and becomes jealous of Bens prowess in the sky. The drone plane turns on the others and heads out to blow up a warlords stockpile of moldering Russian nukes; Ben scrambles to reel the stray back in while Cummings plots how best to save his career. While Stealth"" offers a superficial portrait of the new Navy"" -- white black female -- Lucas quickly becomes the movies blue-eyed top gun while Foxx is sidelined and Biels Kara has to bail out of her stalled Talon fighter. Over North Korea -- where else?The sequence in which she plummets to earth dodging the fireball remnants of her jet is a pulse-quickening visual marvel by far the strongest moment in the film. All the action sequences in fact are everything summer-movie fans could hope for digitized bursts of retinal overstimulation that play like -- you guessed it -- a video game. EDIs in-cockpit taste for Incubus songs written by the band for the film provides the requisite music to pump fists by although the duet with the Pretenders Chrissie Hynde over the final credits comes as a shock. Chrissie honey did you even read the script? (As for Shepards participation presumably there are college bills to pay and revivals of True West"" just arent doing the trick.)The issue isnt the quality of the action scenes because these days thats mostly what Hollywood is good for. The issue isnt even the lurking fears of Defense Department ordnance run amok that Stealth"" purports to address. The issue is that this is exactly the sort of movie we dont need right now a delusional military fantasy in which collateral damage doesnt exist.That initial strike involves dropping an implosion bomb"" on an apartment building in downtown Rangoon thats miraculously occupied only by the terrorists; the cute kids next door remain unhurt. Later when EDIs assault on the warlord causes radioactive dust to drift over a nearby village Kara calls in the medics to relieve the terrified villagers -- with what? Gatorade? -- and thats the last we hear of that. Oh a few North Korean soldiers get killed but theyre as one-dimensional as Purcells willowy Thai girlfriend (Jaipetch Toonchalong) who nods and smiles uncomprehendingly as he mumbles about the human cost of war.Am I spoiling the party? Harshing the high-flying flyboy buzz? Tough. For a movie to pretend in the face of the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi men women and children directly or indirectly caused by our presence there that we can wage war without anyone really getting hurt isnt naive or wishful thinking or a jim-dandy way to spend a Saturday night at the movies.

"Stealth Plane Stupid washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Stealth Plane Stupid A squadron of fighter pilots gets a new wing man -- a robotic one -- in ""Stealth."" (Digital Domain/columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 29 2005 The real star of ""Stealth"" -- a movie about a trio of hotshot Navy pilots that is so clueless it makes its best actor Jamie Foxx play dispensable sidekick to Josh Lucas and Jessica Biel -- isnt even a person. Hes a machine in military parlance an unmanned combat aerial vehicle or UCAV programmed with artificial intelligence that allows him to learn on the fly so to speak as he trains with his reluctant human counterparts. In other words hes a smart robot plane. Make that smartass since if he were a person hed be a 15-year-old boy. Definitely a boy. Nicknamed ""Eddie"" after his other acronym EDI (which stands for Extreme Deep Invader) this piece of high-tech military hardware speaks with a male voice that sounds suspiciously like that of the HAL 9000 computer in ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" Didnt the guy who designed him ever see that movie? Apparently not. Otherwise he would have known that machines that talk like creepy massage therapists do not inspire confidence in those who work with them. Clearly the guys who made this movie (director Rob Cohen and writer W.D. Richter) did see the 1968 film since they rip it off liberally along with such lesser fare as ""Top Gun"" ""Behind Enemy Lines"" and the 1980s talking-car TV show ""Knight Rider."" How else is EDI like a teenage boy? He downloads music off the Internet (with a special affinity for bad headbanger rock n roll) has poor impulse control and disrespect for authority and imitates the risky behavior of others (in this case Lucass brash glory-hogging fly boy Ben Gannon) without regard for consequences. The only thing missing are zits. Its not inappropriate that EDI -- who goes AWOL with a plan to attack a military target in Russia that doesnt even exist and then has to be reined in by his human chaperones one of whom gets shot down over North Korea and has to be rescued -- is an adolescent male. After all the movie itself is a kind of adolescent male fantasy with cool gadgetry a smokin hot babe and awesome explosions. Even I will admit that one special-effects kaboom in particular involving a leaking airborne fuel plane was as the kids of today say money . (Do they even say that anymore?) As for the rest of the movie its as silly as the name of the scientist who built EDI Dr. Keith Orbit (Richard Roxburgh). And no thats not his real name. He changed it were told from something else. From what? Dr. Strangelove? Oh ""Stealth"" tries to take the high ground every once in a while masking its inanity as sci-fi films often do with such jargony gobbledygook as ""pulse detonator"" ""neural network"" and ""war vector scenario."" (Or something like that. The dialogue is often drowned out by engine noise.) It also tries briefly to reach out to the grown-ups in the audience by having Ben pontificate about the cruel realities of war saying ""I dont think war should become some kind of video game."" The problem is thats exactly how ""Stealth"" treats war. Its loud has a crunching soundtrack lots of photogenic destruction of life and property and no one -- well almost no one -- gets hurt in the end. ""Its a bag of chips"" says Ben in disgust about EDI. I could say the same thing about ""Stealth"" but I wouldnt use the word chips. STEALTH (PG-13 117 minutes) -- Contains violence occasional verbal obscenity and an obscene gesture. Area theaters.

Stealth Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2005) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/stealth-2005,200,stealth18,stealth,rogerebert
"Stealth | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; stealth ) Stealth (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli If Rob Cohens name wasnt attached to this project I would swear it was the work of Michael Bay. It has all of the crowd-pleasing directors trademarks plastic characters chaotic camerawork lots of things blowing up and an incredibly dumb screenplay. In short it represents a great time at the movies for anyone who has recently undergone a frontal lobotomy. No wonder the guy sitting next to me started surfing the Internet with his blackberry less than half-way through this loud frenetic snooze-fest. Getting an audience to suspend disbelief isnt all that hard. If filmmakers can get viewers to buy into the premise theyll usually be along for the entire ride. The problem with Stealth is that the movie starts out too stupid to be moderately credible then proceeds to violate nearly every law of physics chemistry and logic. You dont have to be an engineer a mathematician or a scientist to realize that much of whats happening on screen bears no resemblance to any kind of reality. For Stealth to work suspending disbelief isnt enough. It has to be switched off altogether. Some people can do this. Im not one of them. At various times this movie wants to be different things. For a while its a Top Gun clone. Then its War Games with a dose of the Star Trek episode ""A Taste of Armageddon"". (""War has to be messy"") Ultimately it turns into Knight Rider in a Plane. It will come as no surprise that Stealth fails to provide any three-dimensional characters. The action while high on pyrotechnics is low on suspense. I suppose the aerial dogfights are cool - all five minutes of them (if you add them up). And the sight of Jessica Biel in a bikini is definitely eye-catching. But thats two minutes tops. And to get to that scene you have to wade through too much bad dialogue and predictable plotting to make it worth your while. Stealth introduces us to an elite trio of Navy fliers Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas) Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) and Henry Purcell (Jamie Foxx). They have been hand-picked by their C.O. Captain George Cummings (Sam Shepard) for an anti-terrorism pilot program. Now aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln in the Philippine Sea they are about to become active. But Cummings has a surprise for them. They are to be joined by a fourth aircraft - an ultra-secret unmanned vehicle codenamed EDI that is controlled by the most advanced artificial intelligence ever designed. On the way back to the ship after successfully completing the first mission EDI is struck by lightning and this causes him to go haywire. Suddenly hes disobeying orders and following his prime directive - to ""survive"" - possibly at the expense of the lives of anyone trying to stop him. As EDIs actions become more extreme he precipitates international incidents and forces Cummings to consider a drastic course of action. The summary pretty much writes itself which is also true of the screenplay. W.D. Richter hasnt penned anything for ten years and either Cohen destroyed his script or he should have stayed out of circulation for a while longer. The style of the movie is in keeping with that of some of the directors recent projects. Cohens impressive resume includes titles like xXx The Fast and the Furious and The Skulls. How can you go wrong with someone like that at the helm? Acting-wise Im tempted to say that the big difference between Stealth and the aforementioned Knight Rider is that this movie doesnt have anyone with the acting caliber of David Hasselhoff. Jamie Foxx wears sunglasses throughout the film probably to remind us that he won an Oscar for Ray. The quality of his performance isnt reminiscent. Foxx gets third billing to Josh Lucas and Jessica Biel both of whom look great in bathing suits. Thats their noteworthy characteristic. Reliable performers like Joe Morton and Sam Shepard do barely enough to justify getting a pay check - show up have their lines memorized and say them without bursting into laughter. Stealth has the feel of something thats normally dumped into theaters in late August when studios jettison overpriced trash. However Columbia believes that this may be a ""sleeper"" hit. That term is appropriate but not in the way the executives expect. Overlong disjointed and rarely compelling Stealth has the capacity to put viewers into a catatonic state. But its probably too much to hope that the film will slip into and out of multiplexes without anyone noticing.

Richter; Release Date Wide 07/29/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 117; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted July 27 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT Theres a new threat among us. It is faceless and fiendishly intelligent with only one goal to destroy its enemies. It feeds on technology but also on something darker gathering information it stores in an all-seeing nerve center. How dark is it? Lets just say this It has downloaded every last song available on the Internet. Look out al-Qaeda In Stealth a high-velocity low-concept sky-attack thriller the world is under siege by terrorists and rogue warlords but the real danger is a foe more homegrown and familiar your new wingman. It is not a man at all you see but a top secret American droid fighter plane that thinks and flies all by itself operating entirely by computer. Nicknamed ""Eddie"" its actual moniker being the acronym EDI (so clever) it looks like a giant copper stingray with a pulsating blue marble of a brain housed in its cockpit and it even talks -- in a voice meant to evoke HAL the ominously sensitive computer-with-feelings from 2001 A Space Odyssey. EDI is programmed to kill but when he speaks in those dulcet tones of servitude hes like KITT from Knight Rider on his wimpiest day. Hes so icky-fey that he sounds as if hes warming up to play Felix in a dinner-theater production of The Odd Couple. The job of breaking in this awesome hunk of machinery has fallen to Ben (Josh Lucas) Kara (Jessica Biel) and Henry (Jamie Foxx) an elite task force of Naval Air Force pilots who are used to working as a close-knit trio. They have no desire to take on a fourth member of the team let alone one that isnt human. The decision however has already been made by their commanding officer (Sam Shepard) a sinister crew-cut firebrand who is plugged into the corridors of power. The creators of Stealth have devised what sounds like a shrewdly corrupt strategy for having their bombs-away excess and eating it too. Directed by Rob Cohen the youth-action pulp packager who made The Fast and the Furious and XXX the movie with its opening crawl about fighting ""the enemy"" and its demagogic grab bag of global threats was obviously conceived as a Top Gun for the new millennium a fantasy of good-looking kids in hyperspeed planes zapping evil out of the sky. Stealth is full of whooshing jet engines hurtling landings on aircraft carriers and lava orange fireballs -- the standard aerial military videogame porn. Except that its EDI the droid cruiser that gets to do all the macho-decadent neo-80s ass-kicking stuff; it even blasts cruddy power-synth rock amp; roll. This allows Lucas Ben the groups hot-dog renegade of a leader to remain a good liberal citizen and for the movie to pander to xenophobic war-on-terror absolutism without falling into it. Ordered to target a Tajikistani warlord who is parading a cache of nuclear weapons Ben rejects the assignment recoiling at any possibility of collateral damage. Its EDI the programmed superfighter who blasts first and asks questions later. Hes the one who needs to have his wings clipped. I went into Stealth hoping that its talented cast might make it more entertaining than it had any right to be. Yet the stars are asked to chew on the driest of technobabble and to strike poses of flyboy and flygirl moxie that make them look callow rather than heroic. Josh Lucas with his junior Kevin Costner dreamboat-hayseed sexiness is an appealing actor with a wholesome easy style but he needs to tone down his crinkled glow of self-love. Its almost bizarre to see Jamie Foxx in a role this lightweight after his complex triumph in Ray. (Stealth was shot before he won the Oscar.) When he isnt strapped into his cockpit Foxx doesnt get to do much besides strut flirt and spin a basketball; he brings little to the party apart from airy self-mockery. Jessica Biel on the other hand is so out of her depth that the movies biggest mistake was to strand her in North Korea. Her parachute crash landing is Stealths one truly harrowing action sequence but whenever the film cuts to her ragged scramble to the border it stops dead. In all the attacks on liberal Hollywood it is often forgotten that Top Gun a movie that might almost have been commissioned by the Navy was a perfect pop paradigm of Reaganite swagger. Stealth a dregs-of-summer knockoff is too ponderous and inept to serve a comparable function now yet the films lack of thrust may be related to an absence of conviction about its own war-is-a-videogame cliches. On some level the people who made this movie understand that its no longer hip the way that it was 20 years ago to sit in a chair and cheer as other people fight.
