Inspired by a Vanity Fair article by William Prochnau and a book by former hostage victim Thomas R. Hargrove it gives us a peek into the world of Kamp;R (kidnap and ransom). As organized kidnapping has become a big business it has given rise to Kamp;R insurance policies routinely taken out by multinational corporations on behalf of their endangered employees. The insurance companies in turn employ profession- al negotiators--many of whom are former CIA FBI or Interpol agents--to bargain for the lives of the hostages spirited off by mercenary rebel forces.Thats the job of London-based Aussie Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) a former soldier with a calm cool bedside manner. In ""Proof of Life"" Thorne finds himself holding the hand of Alice Bowman (Meg Ryan) whose engineer husband Peter (David Morse) has been abducted by drug-running guerrillas in the fictitious South American country of Tecala. Making matters worse for Peter his failing company has canceled its insurance policy. Thorne who prides himself on his strictly-business professionalism at first turns his back on the job but we know better. We also know this being a Hollywood movie that his emotional detachment will be compromised by his growing attachment to his attractive client.To be fair Tony Gilroys screenplay keeps the romance on the back burner. The focus alternates between the captives ordeal in the mountains (the gorgeous locations are actually Ecuador) where he is at the mercy of young trigger-happy rebels and Thornes attempts to bring the 3 million demand down to a manageable 600 grand. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Thorne is the most compelling aspect of ""Proof of Life"" thanks to Crowes quiet hard-bitten charisma. Its a part Bogart once would have played--the amoral tough guy who rises to the moral occasion--and Crowe gives it just the right note of gravel-voiced masculinity.But neither Crowe Ryan nor the topical subject keeps ""Proof of Life"" from feeling recycled. For all the up-to-the-minute research the movie still gives off the musty scent of Hollywood contrivance. Havent we seen these stereotypical wild-eyed guerrillas and shifty-eyed corporate types a hundred times before? Instead of maximizing the tales urgency the melodramatic flourishes just make it seem more generic. The wonderful Pamela Reed injects a splash of spiky unexpected feeling as Peters busybody sister; you wish there were more moments when somebody made a move you couldnt second-guess. This slick handsomely produced thriller only gets the pulse half racing.

Starring Russell Crowe Meg Ryan David Morse and David Caruso. Directed by Taylor Hackford. (VHS and DVD. R. 127 minutes.) Is there an actor built more Ford-tough than Russell Crowe? Were he a car hed be a pre-recall Explorer some noiseless irony-free SUV with roomy interior and fuel injection whose job is simply to get you where you need to go. Crowe isnt American but he seems to be even talking in his native Australian accent as he does in ""Proof of Life"" a hostage drama that oscillates between soap opera and action flick. Related Stories Proof Mostly Motion / Ryan-Crowe romance flat The movie is barely interested in Meg Ryans suffering as the wife of a man taken hostage or the psychodrama waiting on the other side of the hostage narrative. Instead its irrevocably obsessed with the ins and outs of the kidnap and ransom business. It opens ""MacGyver"" style with Crowe explaining the philosophy of the hostage rescue and closes with the manliest display of heartbreak since Warren Beatty stood atop a Hollywood hill and watched Julie Christie drive back to Jack Warden in ""Shampoo."" Still springing a guy from a thatched cage seems juicier than anything going on between Ryan and Crowe as Alice Bowman and Terry Thorne. When Alices engineer husband Peter (David Morse) is kidnapped by a faction of Colombian rebels world-class hostage negotiator Thorne is dispatched to get him back. Peter has been swiped by a band of former Marxists who have fallen on hard ideological times and are now just money-hungry cocaine-mongers. Typical. Elsewhere its as if director Taylor Hackford wanted to keep the offscreen tabloid-ready affair that was brewing between his two stars out of his movie. So he blocks it with frequent trips to watch Peter try to liberate himself. This would explain how emotionally off-kilter things are. The heat you feel between Crowe and Ryan is People magazine subtext. Writer Tony Gilroy found one half of ""Proof of Lifes"" inspiration in the Thomas Hargrove book ""The Long March to Freedom"" and the other half in Vanity Fair apparently where Hollywood goes for a hard-hitting story. Advisory This movie contains violence and profanity.

(Castle Rock) ""Proof of Life"" isnt a movie. Its an overpriced scrapbook. Cobbled together from factoids and anecdotes gleaned from a Vanity Fair article about international kidnapping and counter-kidnapping director Taylor Hackfords movie is an eye-catching but empty compendium of spectacular Andean mountains haunting vistas and zero organization. Theres a story here but it feels haphazardly glued together. And the movie gets no help from its staggeringly uninspired leads Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe. If the actors really had the steamy extramarital romance the tabloids have banner-headlined lately they must have saved the heat for each other not the cameras. On screen it looks as if both performers are bound and determined to prove theres nothing between them. When dam engineer Peter Bowman (David Morse) is captured in an unnamed South American country by a narco-terrorist guerrilla army his captors demand 3 million in ransom. That leaves Bowmans wife Alice (Ryan) and his sister (Pamela Reed) scrambling for a solution. Enter Thorne Terry Thorne (Crowe) a blue-chip negotiator who comes with a high price tag. Hes done deals like this around the world including a hair-raising incident in Chechnya which we see in a sort of James Bond prelude at the beginning of the movie. Unfortunately since Peters company suddenly concludes it cant pay for his services Terry is forced to bow out. But wait Terry has realized something The client is Meg Ryan This calls for special measures. After initially rejecting Alice Terry returns to do the job gratis. Hes ready to talk with the rebels and if push comes to shove paint his face don fatigues round up a few mercenary pals and get native. But first . . . its time for a little negotiation and some romantically suggestive moments with The Client. Except this romantic premise - the whole point of watching this movie in the first place - never gets off the ground. Theyre always hovering around each other as she tells him dully scripted confessions about her marriage and the great traumatic event that occurred in Africa (dont ask); the movie never quite shows us that something (other than moss or cobwebs) is growing between them. When that inevitable kiss occurs its hard not to exclaim Huuuhhh? ""Are you in love with this woman?"" asks Dino (David Caruso) one of Terrys soldier-of-fortune buddies. Got me. Meanwhile poor old Peter Bowman stuck in mountaintop stir counts the days grows a beard and waits for his subplot scenes. If this were ""Casablanca"" hed be the Paul Henreid character - the earnest politically committed chump who doesnt have a clue whats really going on with his wife and that dashing loner. But theres a twist Nothing is going on. This could be the dullest extramarital dalliance in recent memory. Want to know the best part of this movie? The end credits As we learn the names of cast and crew including Stand-By Rigger Animal Wrangler and Weight Loss Consultant (I am not making this up) there are some fantastic aerial shots of the Andes where ""Proof of Life"" was filmed. But alas this travelogue section does little to redeem what preceded. Were having a lovely time the cinematography department seems to be telling us sorry we had to make a movie. ""Proof of Life"" (R 135 minutes) - Contains drug use battle carnage strong language and no sign of Dennis Quaid.

C+ Proof of Life Genre Action/Adventure Mystery and Thriller Romance; Starring Russell Crowe Meg Ryan David Caruso David Morse; Director Taylor Hackford; Author Tony Gilroy; Producer (group) Bel Air Entertainment Castle Rock Productions Pinewood Studios; Release Date Wide 12/08/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 135; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted December 8 2000 -- 1200 AM EST In Proof of Life Meg Ryan plays Alice Bowman who is stationed with her husband Peter (David Morse) in a nervous Latin American country. Hes an American engineer working on a dam-building project; shes what Peter affectionately but pointedly calls a ""little hippie."" His point seems to be that while Alice is too much of a free spirit to bother learning Spanish shes a whiz at accessorizing with a studied pizzazz that doesnt generally suit company wives but nicely suits the current version of Ryans trendsetting tresses. But I digress Peter soon gets kidnapped and held for a 3 million ransom by antigovernment forces who regularly barter human lives for cold cash. Thats when Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) appears. Hes a professional ""Kamp;R"" (kidnap and ransom) negotiator one of a new breed of global-economy cowboys routinely brought in by a companys insurer to deal with rustlers. Terry is gifted with Crowes palpable physical presence and stubbly virility and in the movies slack shorthand characterization-by-wardrobe hes a serious person anti-pizzazz. Hes brusque commanding and so immune to workaday emotional entanglements that he drops the job when he learns that Peters company on the verge of bankruptcy has canceled its kidnap insurance. Then he reappears either drawn by heretofore hidden reserves of moral goodness or by the charms of Alices winsome smile her tousled head her cunning tank tops. And quicker than you can say Casablanca the tough guy with the ""I stick my neck out for no one"" attitude assumes the assignment of extricating Peter on his own assisted by a mate called Dino (David Caruso) with a similar addiction to high-risk thrills. The movies title is taken from the first demand of all Kamp;R pros -- proof that the hostage is still alive; the plot is inspired by William Prochnaus 1998 Vanity Fair article about the Kamp;R industry blended with aspects of an autobiography by Thomas Hargrove a kidnapping survivor. And indeed throughout Proof of Life director Taylor Hackford strews pieces of a decent jittery documentary-style adventure pic about what it takes to make it out alive for the captive as well as for his rescuers and family. Morse undergoes a shocking Tom Hanks-like physical transformation but even more effectively the fine character actor unobtrusively conveys the psychological shifts needed for a chained man in the jungle to survive. A welcome sight on screen again Caruso as Dino lopes with mad-dog mercenary excitement at the chance to play superhero once more with his old pal Terry; the two are Louie and Rick bound in a beautiful friendship of swagger. ""That was fun"" Dino comments to his buddy after a particularly dangerous bit of daring. The other mans acknowledgment is just a little less perceptible than the nod with which Rick gave leave for the band at his bar to play ""La Marseillaise."" A nod goes a long way with Crowe as charismatic an untamable guys guy as weve got among movie stars today. And that magnetism is useful in aligning Ryan with the rest of the company in this production His star power big and self-assured calms her tendency toward actressy heebie-jeebies and in his presence she appears to relax a little more and listen a little better. (Cant think where I read it something about a romance between the two?) But a focal tug-of-war occurs every time the movie shifts to Alice even if its just for a one-shot of the actress looking fetchingly soulful. Ryan is a performer who needs her own key light -- its silly to fight it far better just to give it to her and let her glow. Proof of Life however shouldnt be a movie about key lighting or wardrobe or whether Alice in a strained sentimental back story is mourning a miscarriage that occurred eight months ago. (Terry too is sentimentalized in a distracting subplot involving estrangement from his son whom he visits on the rugby field of the boys English boarding school.) Proof of Life when it breathes is about guys in love with the thrill of running around outwitting other guys then getting together afterward to slap each other on the back aroused by danger. Sometimes the life-and-death game involves guns sometimes wads of cash; usually the deal involves subterfuge and silent SWAT-team-style watch me hand gestures. But when its dull which it is too often for a kidnap caper this movie is about a woman chirping ""notice anything new about my outfit?"" to a man whose idea of style is a jacket not crusted in human blood.

""Proof of Life"" exhibits distressingly low vital signs. Given the exciting potential of the kidnap-and-ransom storyline unusual locations and combustible star pairing Taylor Hackford has delivered a disappointingly routine thriller that prefers to lean on tired Hollywood conventions rather than to explore fresh dramatic and stylistic territory. Despite the presence of the much-publicized Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe at the top of the cast this Warner Bros. release from Castle Rock wont be traveling too far at the B.O. Globe-trotting from Chechnya to England to the jungles and mountains of South America this large-canvas production contrives to make a life-and-death situation borderline dull as well as to render a percolating romance enacted by two very appealing screen personalities almost entirely without electricity. Storys backdrop is interesting and relevant but nearly everything that has been placed in the foreground is hackneyed and lacking in imagination. Crowe plays former SAS commando turned hostage negotiator Terry Thorne who is first seen spiriting a man to safety through heavy fire between Russian soldiers and Chechen kidnappers. Hes then sent by his London bosses to the fictional South American country of Tecala where the Marxist revolutionary org ELT has mutated into a large guerrilla force dedicated to the capitalist endeavor of kidnapping for profit. Latest victim of the undisciplined but heavily armed band is Peter Bowman (David Morse) a Yank engineer in Tecala building a dam he sincerely believes will benefit the impoverished local populace. The ELT of course sees him as an imperialistic leech marches him far into the high-altitude interior and demands 3 million for his safe return. The resulting trauma of his vibrant wife Alice (Meg Ryan) is complicated by the fact that she and her husband havent been getting along too well since she had a miscarriage in Africa the previous stop in their nomadic lives. Terrys confident can-do attitude toward the business of getting Peter back makes Alice focus but some big business shuffling suddenly leaves Alice in the lurch without insurance corporate backing or Terrys help. Although baldly presented in long speeches by Terry the expository revelations about the shadowy world of kidnapping-for-ransom the coded manner in which terms are negotiated and the cynical expectations of both sides are intriguing -- as is at first Peters ordeal at the hands of the guerrillas. When Terry after having been pulled off the job dramatically returns to help Alice for personal reasons the yarn is clearly meant to escalate to a whole new level based on a supposed connection the negotiator and bereaved wife have developed. But all hands -Hackford writer Tony Gilroy Ryan and Crowe -- fail to generate the required subtext and groundswell of desire. Except for the relatively rote commando rescue raid led by Terry a fellow ransom expert (David Caruso) and the latters band of faceless mercenaries the pictures final act therefore goes quite slack before being capped off by a ""Casablanca""-like ending that fully reveals the new tales complete lack of emotional resonance. Pic has its incidental failures as well Scarcely individualized the native South Americans especially the terrorists are portrayed as over-emotional drug-happy inept hysterics a portrait thats not only caricatured but lazy; also the presence of vet English character actor Alun Armstrong as an inebriated older negotiator whos been too long away from home makes one pine for the days when such a role would have been much better developed and then relished by the likes of the late Denholm Elliott. Because of the lack of nuance and romantic undertow Ryan and Crowe are left to skate across the surface of their roles; Crowes character in particular needed some good backstory to give the actor more to work with. Morse was a good offbeat choice to play the abducted husband but most of his screen time is devoted to detailing his physical discomfort. Some nice moments of support are offered by Gottfried John as a ""crazy"" fellow kidnap victim who joins Peter in an unlikely escape attempt from the guerrillas mountain compound. Some of the main interest is generated by the Ecuadorian locations which range from scenic vantage points in Quito to rough wilderness. Craft contributions are pro.
