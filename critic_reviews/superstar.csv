A creation like Mary Katherine Gallagher the morose armpit-smelling Irish Catholic parochial-school geek whose repressed sexuality comes bursting forth in frenzied slapstick spasms may on some level be a satire but whats great about the character is the way it allows Shannon to express something far giddier than satire. Mary Katherine is a self-loathing loser who longs almost unconsciously to be a panty-flashing tongue-waggling slut. Shes a hilarious study in the discombobulating nature of shame. On SNL each Mary Katherine sketch is like a musical number a four-minute portrait of depression rage and triumphant set-crashing release. To call Superstar a TV sketch padded out to feature length would be giving the movie too much credit; it barely boasts enough funny material to fill four minutes. By turning Mary into a halfway presentable heroine the film dissipates her energy -- the depraved lust and weirdly stilted ballet-class stride that Shannon flaunts so brilliantly. The only time we get Mary in an unfiltered dose is when she tongue-kisses a tree and gets ... well aroused. Still having sat through my share of wretched SNL spin-off movies (Its Pat etc.) I think Ive figured out why theyre all so bad. They keep taking these profoundly grotesque characters and making them friendly and domesticated instead of wilder and more warped.

But ""Superstar"" proves a pleasant surprise. With infrequent exceptions movies derived from recurrent ""Saturday Night Live"" skits have been a reliable source of mediocrity -- and the just mildly funny nature of sketches involving Molly Shannons Mary Katherine Gallagher character didnt suggest her promotion to feature length would break this pattern. But ""Superstar"" proves a pleasant surprise. Deftly directed by Bruce McCulloch this amusing if uneven comedy could build on good word of mouth to outpace most ""SNL"" spinoffs at the box office though it probably wont hit the high commercial bar set by the ""Waynes World"" pics. Figure created by Shannon is a pratfall-prone exuberantly clumsy hypergeeky 17-year-old with delusions of showbiz grandeur -- though her main ""talent"" consists of delivering melodramatic monologues from 1970s TV movies. Orphaned (her parents we learn died in a tragic step-dancing accident) and raised by a grandmother (Glynis Johns) she applies a usually misguided pluck to every situation at her cliquish Catholic high school resorting to nervous armpit-sniffing whenever disaster results. Mary Katherines dream is to become a superstar and to engineer an equally stellar first kiss. Winning the schools talent contest (a Catholic Teenage Magazine-sponsored Lets Fight Venereal Disease fund-raiser) just might clinch that first goal. But the second is complicated by the fact that her chosen dreamboat campus football star Sky (Will Ferrell) is already going out with the perfectly blond bitchy and bulimic Evian (Elaine Hendrix). Waiting on the sidelines is smitten Slater (Harland Williams) a mute seemingly dangerous but sensitive leather-jacketed tough guy. Steven Wayne Korens screenplay drop-kicks entertaining spoofs of ""Armageddon"" and ""Carrie"" as well as funny musical numbers amid the well-tuned slapsticky high school satire. Invention flags somewhat after the halfway point but rallies for Mary Katherines climactic talent show extravaganza and some good closing gags. McCulloch a member of the Canadian sketch troupe Kids in the Hall (and helmer of the recent ""Dog Park"") provides more directorial personality here than most ""SNL""-derived features get -- the cheerily absurd color-saturated atmosphere recalls John Waters ""Hairspray"" as well as the Kids own underrated bigscreen effort ""Brain Candy."" He gives a cast of talented comics plenty of room for riffing even if their material isnt always inspired. Beyond Shannon and Ferrells mirthful turns there are notably funny performances by Emmy Laybourne as Mary Katherines best friend in her ""special-education"" class of fellow misfits and Kids/""SNL"" staple Mark McKinney as the schools kindly priest-principal. Stage and screen vet Johns proves rather less at home in this style of comedy however and her scenes drag a bit. Candy-hued production design -- the schools official colors are aqua and burgundy -- abets the general silliness with good tech contributions all around.

Comments Superstar Catholic-school student Mary Katherine Gallagher a character created by Saturday Night Lives Molly Shannon sensuously shivers pants and sighs while dramatizing her make-out fantasies--when she isnt inhaling her own body odor for some kind of reassurance. Contrasting the erotic with the disgusting is usually provocative and can be funny but not in this underdog comedy which is based on the assumption that a nerd girls unrequited lust is more pathetic and more poignant than anybody elses. Bruce McCulloch directed a screenplay by Steven Wayne Koren; with Will Ferrell Elaine Hendrix Mark McKinney Glynis Johns Emmy Laybourne and Harland Williams.

Starring Molly Shannon and Will Ferrell. Directed by Bruce McCulloch. Written by Steven Wayne Koren. (PG-13. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If Mary Katherine Gallagher didnt remind us of ourselves she wouldnt be so terrifyingly funny. Geeky and lonely and aching to be loved shes that voice in all of us that cries for attention -- only in her case the voice is louder loonier and more intense. Played by the gifted comedian Molly Shannon Mary Katherine is the latest ""Saturday Night Live"" character to be spun off into her own movie. ""Superstar"" which opens today delivers plenty of laughs and succeeds on a level that recent ""SNL"" movies (""Its Pat"" and ""A Night at the Roxbury"") didnt. It works primarily because Shannon who created Mary Katherine as a college student in the late 80s is such a likable performer. Like Gilda Radner from the original ""SNL"" cast she has the ability to be ridiculous and endearing at the same time. In ""Superstar"" we find Mary Katherine enrolled at St. Monicas a Catholic high school in the tiny town of Besame Heights and employed as a ""rewind girl"" at a video store. Her parents are dead and she lives with her grandmother (Glynis Johns) and a partially hairless Chinese crested dog. Mary Katherine is dying to be popular and get her first kiss but truth be told shes a mess. Her hair is greasy and pulled back her glasses are too big and her regulation green-plaid shirt is so short that shes constantly flashing her panties without knowing it. And then theres her habit of smelling her armpits. Shannon has tremendous guts as a performer and Mary Katherine the epitome of excruciating adolescence and naked emotional need is a brilliant vehicle for her talent. Theres something dangerous about this character -- shes always a hair shy of total meltdown -- and my only disappointment with ""Superstar"" was its reluctance to take Mary Katherine even farther into the dark world of alienation and adolescence. Instead ""Superstar"" keeps the same goofy antic spirit of an ""SNL"" sketch. Directed by Bruce McCul loch one of the Canadian actors from ""The Kids in the Hall"" and written by Steven Wayne Koren a ""Seinfeld"" and ""SNL"" writer ""Superstar"" focuses on Mary Katherines obsession with a boy named Sky (Will Ferrell) and her quest to enter a campus talent show. It doesnt help that Mary Katherines odd behavior has landed her in Special Ed where shes branded ""re tard"" and taunted by Skys girlfriend a noxious anorexic blonde named Evian (Elaine Hendrix). But when Catholic Teen magazine sponsors a ""Lets Fight Venereal Disease"" talent competition theres no stopping her. The talent show of course is this movies equivalent to the boxing match in ""Rocky."" Like Brian De Palmas ""Carrie"" which it blatantly steals from ""Superstar"" asks us to root for Mary Katherine and by extension for all the geeks who yearn for love and respect. Its a bit of a stretch for Shannon whos over 30 to be playing pubescent Mary Katherine but the movie seems to acknowledge that by casting the similarly age-inappropriate Ferrell as her campus Romeo. Theyre probably the oldest ""teenagers"" since Dana Carvey played Garth in ""Waynes World."" ..

A creation like Mary Katherine Gallagher the morose armpit-smelling Irish Catholic parochial-school geek whose repressed sexuality comes bursting forth in frenzied slapstick spasms may on some level be a satire but whats great about the character is the way it allows Shannon to express something far giddier than satire. Mary Katherine is a self-loathing loser who longs almost unconsciously to be a panty-flashing tongue-waggling slut. Shes a hilarious study in the discombobulating nature of shame. On SNL each Mary Katherine sketch is like a musical number a four-minute portrait of depression rage and triumphant set-crashing release. To call Superstar a TV sketch padded out to feature length would be giving the movie too much credit; it barely boasts enough funny material to fill four minutes. By turning Mary into a halfway presentable heroine the film dissipates her energy -- the depraved lust and weirdly stilted ballet-class stride that Shannon flaunts so brilliantly. The only time we get Mary in an unfiltered dose is when she tongue-kisses a tree and gets ... well aroused. Still having sat through my share of wretched SNL spin-off movies (Its Pat etc.) I think Ive figured out why theyre all so bad. They keep taking these profoundly grotesque characters and making them friendly and domesticated instead of wilder and more warped.
