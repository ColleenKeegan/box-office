This is the story of the Tuskegee Airmen - the segregated units of African-American pilots who served in the US Air Force in WWII - and has been a pet project of Lucas since the late 80s. A string of young black filmmakers came and went until the job was finally handed to TV veteran Anthony Hemingway. But in almost every aspect - from the slick aerial dogfights to the stilted dialogue from the cookie-cutter characterisation to the sense of cosy old Hollywood nostalgia - this has Lucass fingerprints all over it.Our heroes are Easy (Nate Parker) and Lightning (David Oyelowo) two members of the 332nd fighter group stationed in southern Italy. While Colonel Bullard (Terrence Howard) is off in Washington trying to persuade the brass to take his outfit seriously the group is reduced to trivial tasks rarely catching sight of the enemy. Can Bullards boys convince their superiors that the Tuskegee Airmen are up to the job?Well of course they can. Because this is the kind of movie where hard work pays off where honesty triumphs over adversity where clean-cut flying aces with Lando Calrissian-style pencil moustaches charm the pants off southern Italian peasants (known for their racial tolerance in the 1940s). The flying scenes are stunning - though the CGI feels a little heavy-handed - and the cast acquit themselves admirably given the mealiness of the dialogue. But theres no sense of threat or danger this is a film with its head stuck firmly in the clouds.

If you take away the fact that it is about Black airmen it is a story told hundreds of times before. You have almost every cliche of film making with the underdogs coming good. The central group consist of the father figure with the drink problem; the maverick with the attitude problem and the youngster trying to prove he belongs. Yes the cliches hit you hard and regular with the miraculous volte face from total racism to total respect.

""Glory"" was the stirring 1989 film based on a true story about a group of black Union soldiers during the Civil War who battled prejudice both inside and out of the Army. (Denzel Washington won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role.) ""Red Tails"" produced by George Lucas and directed by feature first-timer Anthony Hemingway (TVs ""The Wire"" ""Treme"" and ""CSI NY"") is about the Tuskegee Airmen a group of black Army pilots who served with distinction in Europe during World War II despite facing multiple roadblocks caused by racial prejudice. (The title derives from the fact that the tails of their planes were painted a bright red.) The story of the Tuskegee airmen and the hurdles they encountered is certainly one worth putting up on the big screen. Sadly ""Red Tails"" tells its inspiring story in the most old-fashioned Saturday-afternoon-at-the-movies kind of way. The movie occasionally flies but it never soars. In showing how the Tuskegee Airmen finally earned the right to fly combat missions -- it was felt by the brass that African-American pilots werent up to the task-and distinguished themselves once they did ""Red Tails"" falls back on all the usual bomber crew film cliches. When Hollywood was cranking out WWII movies with regularity every bomber crew had one of each a rural yokel an urban wise guy a scared young kid the angry guy various ethnic types etc. In ""Red Tails"" the featured pilots may all be black but theyre still a mixed bag featuring a one-note one of each the pilot who secretly drinks the hotshot who takes too many risks the joker the religious guy and ... well you get the idea. Despite the weaknesses in the screenplay of this long-gestating project -- Lucas wanted to make the movie for at least two decades -- there are still moments that will stir an audience. These come primarily from two actors Terence Howard who plays a colonel who stubbornly takes on his superiors at the Pentagon to enable the airmen to fly meaningful missions and David Oyelowo as an ace pilot who gently courts a non-English speaking beauty from the Italian town near the airmens base. There are also plenty of action-filled aerial battle scenes but they soon develop a monotonous repetitive rhythm alternating between CGI shots of planes attacking each other and going down in flames and interior cockpit shots featuring pilots looking either stressed or exultant. Such sameness eventually lessens the bark of these dogfights. In the end ""Red Tails"" is like the old patched together B-40s its pilots are stuck flying early in the movie. It can still do the job but you just know that there should have been a better-built and sleeker model out there. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Comments (8) click to enlarge Red Tails Video Rated PG-13  125 minutes  2012 George Lucas served as executive producer for this effects-heavy action film about the Tuskegee Airmen and it feels as synthetic and dull as The Phantom Menace. The films depiction of Italy in World War II feels like a second- or third-hand memory (and sometimes looks like a computer-game backdrop) and the characters are blatant composites of old war-movie archetypes. This is so generic as storytelling that it fails even as a basic history lesson its hard to believe that the stock conflicts on-screen have any connection to real events. With the exception of Cuba Gooding Jr. (who delivers his lines as though he learned them phonetically) the actors do their best with the material. TV veteran Anthony Hemingway directed.

"Red Tails | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; red-tails ) Red Tails (United States 2012) January 20 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli I wanted to like Red Tails. I really did. Largely financed by George Lucas (whose fingerprints are all over the final cut) this movie tells a story - that of the 332nd Fighter Group (a.k.a. ""The Tuskegee Airmen"") - that could combine dramatic power with impressive air combat sequences. Its a movie Lucas has reportedly been toying with making for more than 20 years. Sadly the result is a disappointment. Sure the aerial battles are technically adept and occasionally exhilarating but its almost painful to sit through some of the ""drama"" that occurs on the ground. The character-building moments are woeful but theyre masterpieces of writing when compared to the dialogue. One can get away with a lot of cornball speeches a long time ago in a galaxy far far away but it doesnt work nearly as well a short time ago on planet Earth. This is not the first time the story of The Tuskegee Airmen has been committed to film. In 1995 a made-for-HBO movie by that name did an adequate job of telling the tale. It would be fair to say there was room for improvement but Red Tails doesnt take advantage. This movie is as faithful to history as it needs to be to get the major points across about racism in the armed forces and the importance of the 332nd in breaking the color barrier but it does so in a ham-handed manner. Subtlety has never been one of Lucas sterling qualities and theres none in evidence here. There are times when characters actually provide background exposition as dialogue. (It goes something like this and while this is not verbatim its not an exaggeration Bomber pilot - ""Look The fighters protecting us are leaving to destroy those German decoy planes. Now were on our own and in these big mostly defenseless bombers we can easily be shot down."") Red Tails is primarily the story of four main characters - squadron leader Marty ""Easy"" Julian (Nate Parker); his best friend Joe ""Lightning"" Little (David Oyelowo); the wisecracking Samuel ""Joker"" George (Elijah Kelley); and the youngest member of the group Ray ""Junior"" Gannon (Tristan Wilds). They and others are defined by stereotyped characteristics. Easy is a drunk with a domineering father and a tendency toward self-pity. Lightning is a hotshot with a soft spot for the ladies. Joker doesnt know how to be serious. And Junior wants to earn a more ""mature"" nickname. Theres nothing especially interesting about any of these individuals although the fault is in the writing not the acting. Its a testament to the skill of the performers that they are able to keep straight faces while uttering their lines. At the outset the pilots of the 332nd are stationed in Italy running mop-up missions (like blowing up munitions trucks and trains) while under constant threat of being shut down by bigoted generals in Washington. When given a chance to provide air cover during an amphibious landing they prove their worth and are given more important missions including escorting the first bomber squadron to strike Berlin. Along the way a few annoying subplots occur the grossly underdeveloped story of Juniors time in a German prison camp Lighnings romance with an Italian woman and Easys self-recriminations after one of his men is badly injured. Stalag 18 is an especially odd inclusion since it seems shoehorned in for no apparent reason beyond giving Tristan Wilds a few extra minutes of screen time. As a movie in its own right this might have been interesting but it is presented in such a rushed shorthand fashion that it functions as a distraction. Red Tails two most high profile actors arent given much to do. Cuba Gooding Jr. (who was also in the 1995 The Tuskegee Airmen) spends his time chomping on a pipe and delivering inspirational speeches. Terrence Howard as the commanding officer is mostly in Washington arguing with close-minded fellows about the capabilities of his men. He gets an opportunity to deliver his own inspirational speech or two as well. All of Red Tails undercooked cheese tends to fade into the background when the characters get into the air. Its obvious that about 90% of the filmmakers attention was focused on these scenes. A new ""11.1"" sound system was designed for the movie (although its only available in a handful of theaters). Its a shame the level of meticulous detail lovingly bestowed upon planes outmaneuvering and shooting at each other isnt evident in the other aspects of Red Tails. And if on some occasions the fighters look a little like X-Wings what do you expect? When making Star Wars Lucas used WW2 dogfights as his inspiration. Here weve come full circle. Its unclear how much input Lucas had in the final product but considering that he personally financed the movie its likely his ""Executive Producer"" credit doesnt cover his contributions. The director TV veteran Anthony Hemingway was hand-picked by Lucas but there are rumors of re-shoots in which Hemingway was not involved. According to Lucas this is the planned middle chapter of a three-movie saga although its unclear whether Episodes I and III will ever see the light of day (both are supposed to be more serious and less action-oriented). The supposed goal of Red Tails is to provide an old-fashioned story of glory and heroism. In its best moments it is that. Unfortunately those ""best moments"" comprise only about 50% of Red Tails and it would be cruel to state what the other 50% resembles.

Made by TV director Anthony Hemingway (his big-screen debut) with some help from executive producer George Lucas Red Tails looks more like a TV movie than the TV movie did and is disappointingly shallow. A true story as inspiring as this one deserves a more insightful treatment. After a title card reminds us that Negroes were once considered unfit for military service because of supposed inherent character and intellectual weaknesses Red Tails drops us into the action in Italy 1944. A group of black pilots who trained at Tuskegee Alabama. as an ""experiment"" to see whether their race could be as skillful as whites at shooting enemies while flying airplanes has been relegated to unimportant missions. Theyve been given just enough work for the top brass to say theyre being used but not enough to actually matter. In the skies above them their white counterparts act out a dogfight so comic-book corny that I honestly thought we were seeing a video game or other simulation. (The movies first line of dialogue is a gleeful exclamation ""Germans Lets go"" The only thing missing was ""Wheee"") These Tuskegee flyers are portrayed as a generic bunch of war movie stock characters all represented by nicknames. Easy (Nate Parker) is their strict team leader; he drinks a lot. His best friend Lightning (David Oyelowo) is a maverick and a hotshot and the one burdened with the obligatory romance with a local Italian girl (Daniela Ruah). Deacon (Marcus T. Paulik) trusts that ""black Jesus"" will protect him; Junior (Tristan Wilds) is the enthusiastic new recruit; Smoky (Ne-Yo) plays blues guitar; Joker (Elijah Kelley) jokes; you get the idea. Their commanding officers Col. Bullard (Terrence Howard) and Maj. Stance (Cuba Gooding Jr.) do all they can to convince the higher-ups that the team deserves to be trusted with an important mission. When they do accomplish something impressive racist Col. Mortamus (Bryan Cranston) with his smooth Southern-gentleman accent tells Bullard ""Eight German fighters or eighty German fighters it still doesnt change what I think of you and your boys."" Later the Tuskegee Airmen are assigned to escort an all-white group of pilots who figure oh great having black pilots next to us is the same as having nobody next to us. When the Tuskegee boys their planes tails painted a distinctive red prove their worth the racists immediately change their tune. ""I hope we meet up with those Red Tails next time"" says one. And thats the film in a nutshell. We never get a real sense of the persecution and mistrust these pilots faced nor do we get a real sense of what it felt like to overcome it. The racism is portrayed in the dullest simplest terms -- and so is the mens resilience in the face of it. The plodding screenplay (by John Ridley and Boondocks comic creator Aaron McGruder) is so genteel as to be mundane and Hemingway directs with more reverence than energy. The only time the movie really comes to life is during the dogfight scenes which are moderately exciting but still riddled with old cliches. What were left with is a respectful and well-intentioned historical drama that is neither good enough to seek out nor bad enough to actively avoid. The story of the Tuskegee Airmen ought to be told more often than it is. Red Tails is better than nothing -- but ""nothing"" isnt the other option. That HBO film is still out there and Red Tails doesnt add to it or improve upon it.

"Red Tails Fighting two wars at once |       NJ.com comments Red Tails Fighting two wars at once Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 20 2012 at 800 AM updated January 20 2012 at 834 AM View/Post Comments Jiri Hanzl From right to left Joe Lightning Little (David Oyelowo); Andrew Smokey Salem (Ne-Yo); Ray Junior/Ray Gun Gannon (Tristan Wilds); Maurice Wilson (Michael B. Jordan); Marty Easy Julian (Nate Parker). George Lucas has been trying to get the movie ""Red Tails"" made for a long long time. And it shows. How many scriptwriters hands has this project passed through? How many drafts have been written rewritten thrown out resurrected and then thrown out all over again? Hard to say now -- Lucas first spoke about producing this in the late 80s. But by now whatever the original inspiration was its been lost under layers like a houses once-nice now painted-over paneling. The basic idea is a good one -- the story of the Tuskegee Airmen the all-black fighter groups that battled the Nazis once theyd battled the bigots back home who didnt think they were fit to serve. It also has two charismatic actors in Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. -- and both would have been even better if this had been made a decade ago. But it hasnt and theyve aged out of the leads. So Howard plays the ""Old Man"" commanding officer Col. A.J. Bullard and spends most of his scenes in Washington offices arguing with Army brass. Gooding plays the avuncular Major Stance who seems to exist strictly to give his men pep talks and chew on his pipe. And the real leads are taken over by young actors (Nate Parker David Oyelowo Tristan Wilds Elijah Kelly) who arent nearly as distinguished or distinctive and whose characters nicknames (Easy Lightning Junior Joker) are about all their characters have. They dont add much to the film -- or to a script so corny it not only has a dastardly Nazi pilot with a scar down his face it has him show up at every single air battle cursing these ""Africans"" and snarling lines like ""Show no mercy"" Alas -- mein Gott -- he seems to have left his monocle home. The dustiness of the script is particularly surprising because one of the credited writers is Aaron McGruder who created the take-no-prisoners comic strip ""The Boondocks."" Youd think anyone who named a cartoon character after Huey Newton would have something pointed to say about racism. But the story just limps along from one improbability to another. A pilot takes on an entire bar full of angry white bigots -- and doesnt even get a bloody nose? A pilot tracks down a beauty he first glimpsed while flying over her house -- and romances her to the point of betrothal even though neither can speak the others language. Director Anthony Hemingway at least gets the dogfights right -- theyre wall-to-wall CGI of course but theyre fast and vertiginous and exciting. (You can really see what Lucas had in mind when he was making the first ""Star Wars."") And military buffs will get a kick out of seeing all these vintage planes back on screen. But the film feels a little vintage itself and not in a good way. And instead of pride or anger or resolve all it left me feeling was a little bit of regret that I hadnt been home watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" instead. Ratings note The film contains violence some strong language and alcohol abuse. Red Tails (PG-13) Fox (125 min.) Directed by Anthony Hemingway. With Cuba Gooding Jr. Terrence Howard.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox) Americas World War II African-American fighter pilots first got the movie treatment in 1995 with HBOs ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" which starred Laurence Fishburne and Cuba Gooding Jr.Now producer George Lucas has taken up the important and inspirational story in the new film ""Red Tails."" And some things never change.Gooding Jr. is back joining Terrence Howard in headlining a largely African-American cast including Tristan Wilds Nate Parker David Oyelowo Michael B. Jordan and singer Ne-Yo in Lucas labor of love. The film is said to have cost Lucas upward of 100 million of his own funds. ""Red Tails"" named for the airplanes red tails could be the ""Star Wars"" creators final blockbuster movie. He told The New York Times that he will move into more experimental art house movies after ""Red Tails.""If thats the case Lucas goes out with a bit of a bang. ""Red Tails"" directed by Anthony Hemingway is well-intentioned noble good looking and ""inspired by true events.""Opening with a moldy quote about blacks being inferior and cowardly it immediately plunges viewers into battle showing just how brave and fearless these fighter pilots were in 1943 Italy.But their war isnt only with the Germans. The black airmen are also warring with their white counterparts who do everything from forcing them into older aircraft questioning their right to fight and denying them entry to the Officers Club. The racism the black officers faced as depicted here feels white-washed and easily resolved.The battle scenes soar thanks to top-notch and thrilling special effects. Quieter scenes give characters added dimension such as those that address one officers drinking problem. Other scenes however beg for the next action showpiece.A romance between Lightning (a best-of-show Oyelowo) and a young Italian lass is sweet in how they dont need language to communicate. But their story line ends as only it could. Overreaching fits of melodrama occasionally stilted dialogue and performances by Gooding Jr. and Howard that are mostly a series of serious faces cant keep the shiny ""Red Tails"" from taking flight.""Red Tails""Three stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 205  Content Some sequences of war violence Videos Watch a trailer for Red Tails Jan 19 2012 (...)

James Adams From Fridays Globe and Mail (includes correction) Published Friday Jan. 20 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 224PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English If virtue was the sole or primary criterion for judging a movies worth then Red Tails would score an easy four stars. Its a noble ""inspired-by-a-true-story"" yarn about the Tuskegee Airmen plucky African-American fighter pilots trained in Alabama who overcame mountains of racial prejudice to serve with distinction in the European theatre during the Second World War. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Red Tails"" starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard Movies Red Tails The official trailer The cast is almost entirely African-American the sundry white characters largely cameos. Director Anthony Hemingway best known for TV stints with Treme and The Wire is African-American. Ditto jazz man Terence Blanchard who wrote the score and John Ridley and Aaron McGruder the screenwriters. It also looks good and feels epic courtesy of a purported 100-million (U.S.) budget from Lucasfilms. Virtue aside however Red Tails is a lousy film. Not wincingly bad mind you just mediocre. While the cast is almost uniformly fine particularly Nate Parker as the anxious alcoholic squadron leader Martin (Easy) Julian and David Oyelwo as the rebellious cocky ace Joe (Lightning) Little the performances are hobbled by a script that assigns each character only one note which theyre forced to sound with little variation throughout the films 125-minute duration. Meanwhile the screenwriters idea of dialogue encompasses it seems just two idioms - locker-room-style banter (One pilot ""War is hell."" Another pilot ""Yeah and what were doing is boring as hell."") and speechifying (intoned mostly by Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. playing respectively a colonel and a major). That and the occasional foray into hoary cliche personified most excruciatingly by Lars van Riesen who complete with facial scar plays a nasty Nazi pilot prone to hissing lines like ""Show no mercy"" and ""Die you foolish African"" Unsurprisingly Red Tails - the title refers to the colour of the rear markings on the P-51 fighter aircraft - is at its best when its up in the air machine guns ratatatating flak blasting. Of course all the destruction and death are given the moral weight of a video game. And the various astounding aerial manoeuvres often seem to owe more to the warp-speed twists of Star Wars spacecraft than any Immelmann a propeller-powered Mustang may have accomplished in 1944. Still its fun in a ""war is heck"" sort of way. The films at its worst when its pulled back by the surly bonds of Earth. Ridley and McGruder only caress the many issues inherent in a story about African-Americans serving in a segregated armed forces at the behest of a deeply racist nation. When Lightning proposes marriage to his sexy Italian girlfriend Sofia for example the audience is given no indication as to what a radical even transgressive act that would have been at that time. Interracial marriage wasnt legalized in Alabama until late in the 20th century Mussolinis armies enslaved Ethiopia in 1935 - but Lightning and Sofia seem disingenuously blissfully unmindful of these events and circumstances. Similarly after Lightning responds with fisticuffs to a racial slur uttered in a whites-only officers club we next see him reclining in the brig with nary a broken rib or swollen eye. In real life he would very likely have been killed. Possessing as it does all the heft of a Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos comic book Red Tails in the end leaves you wondering what a good director armed with a more substantial script such as Spike Lee or Norman Jewison ( In the Heat of the Night A Soldiers Story) might have done with its premise and promise. Certainly wed have a more issues-oriented and thoughtful film. More adult in short and not this adrenalin fest for teenage boys and early twentysomethings. George Lucas has indicated that if Red Tails is a success hell consider bankrolling a prequel and a sequel. Based on what we have here though this would probably be too much of a bad thing.

Starring Bryan Cranston Terrence Howard Cuba Gooding Jr. Daniela Ruah Michael B. Jordan Director Anthony Hemingway Running time 200 Release Opened Jan 20 2012  Editorial Review Tuskegee airmen deserve betterBy Mark JenkinsFriday Jan 20 2012Braving German guns on one wing and American racism on the other the Tuskegee Airmen proved themselves some of the best combat pilots of World War II. The African American fliers great achievement merits a great movie. ""Red Tails"" isnt it. The complexions of its heroes aside this George Lucas-produced dogfight epic could have been made during the same decade the airmen helped beat Hitler. The war-movie cliches are as abundant as the antiaircraft fire and the dialogue as wooden as a balsa glider. The leading characters are issued one personality trait apiece and some dont even get that. Cuba Gooding Jr. for example plays Maj. Emanuelle Stance as a man who smokes a pipe. Stance commands the Red Tails - so called for their planes color scheme - at their base in 1944 Italy. Meanwhile Col. A.J. Bullard (Terrence Howard) is in Washington battling Catch-22 military logic The airmen havent been assigned any significant missions and the unit is in danger of being disbanded because it hasnt executed any significant missions. Bullard makes his case and soon the airmen have a big gig escorting U.S. bombers (earnestly termed ""the heavies"") as they lumber toward targets in Germany. The Red Tails quickly impress the bomber crews with their discipline. The fighter pilots stick with the convoys doing their job rather than veering off in search of glory. On an individual level however the flyboys show less self-control. Joe ""Lightning"" Little (David Oyelowo) is a hot dog who takes big risks in love as well as battle. Marty ""Easy"" Julian (Nate Parker) is so overwhelmed by the responsibility of being squadron leader that he regularly sips from a flask that doesnt contain iced tea. There will be casualties of course. But this is the sort of old-fashioned melodrama where at least one man whos presumed dead will turn up in time for the final credits. And the bullets the Red Tails dodge in midair are balanced by the raves they receive on the ground Theyre regularly toasted symbolically or actually by white pilots whose bigotry has been dispelled by seeing the airmen in action. If only beating racism were that simple. ""Red Tails"" works best when it speeds its message into the background. Assisted by a years worth of postproduction at Lucass Industrial Light and Magic director Anthony Hemingway stages several pulse-boosting aerial battles. These sequences are all swoop boom and rat-tat-tat - until some character opens his mouth to utter a line so stilted that it could have drawn giggles in 1946.Contains war violence and alcohol use.

Photo AP Terrence Howard (left) and Cuba Goooding Jr. both talented actors play officers who back up their men 100 percent. Gooding gives his best performance in years. An inspiring rousing tribute to the heroic history-changing Tuskegee Airmen and World War II movies of the 40s ""Red Tails would probably be acclaimed as a minor masterpiece if it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. But because so many blame its producer George Lucas for desecrating their childhoods with the ""Star Wars prequels (not an issue for me) youre going to hear people dump on this a passion project Lucas personally poured 60 million into after trying to sell it to Hollywood studios for 20 years. Listen to the naysayers and youll be missing one of the best January-releases of the past 30 years a well-acted well-directed (by TV veteran Anthony Hemingway) popcorn movie with great aerial battles and solid dramatic scenes that hold your attention for two good hours. Perhaps more importantly it will leave you thirsting to read more about the Tuskegee Airmen the first African-American pilots in the US Army. Loosely inspired by their exploits the film centers on a couple of archetypes excellently played by a pair of little-known actors. Capt. Marty ""Easy Julian (Nate Parker) is a squadron commander who drinks to cope with the stress of making life-or-death decisions. Easys best friend Joe ""Lightning Little (David Oyelowo) is a showboating pilot with little use for rules or his pals commands most excitingly deciding to wreak havoc on a Nazi battleship on the spur of the moment. At a time when many white officers still believed blacks were ""mentally inferior to the white man (in the words of a 1925 Army War College study quoted at the outset) the Tuskegee Airmen are based far from enemy lines in Italy. A bigoted Pentagon big shot (Bryan Cranston) continually tries to marginalize the Red Tails so-called because of the distinctive markings on their planes. But word of Lightnings exploits finally enables the commander of the 332nd Fighter Group (Terrence Howard) to secure a plum assignment of escorting flying fortresses that have been suffering massive losses while on bombing runs. (Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. delivers his best and most subtle performance in years as the pipe-smoking second-in-command.) The measure of the Red Tails historic accomplishment is beautifully illustrated by a later scene where Easy and Lightning are walking past a segregated officers club in Italy and a white officer calls out to them. They fear a racially motivated attack but it turns out the officer is a bomber pilot who wants to buy them a drink to celebrate their heroism -- and the Red Tails end up being toasted inside the club by formerly hostile white airmen. Heavier themes are handled with restraint in a film clearly aimed at the family trade -- not making a big deal for instance of Lightnings interracial romance with a beautiful Italian woman but allowing the audience to wonder what will happen if their plans to marry actually come true. The other major subplot involves a young pilot named Ray ""Junior Gannon (Tristan Wilds) who Easy allows to fly a mission despite serious vision problems. When hes forced to bail out Junior becomes the first black prisoner at a POW camp where he demonstrates a different kind of heroism. ""Red Tails isnt a perfect movie. Some of the dialogue is awkward especially early on (but its not like ""Star Wars prequels which seem to have been translated into Sanskrit and then back into English). And youd think Lucas the founder of Industrial Light and Magic would have more state-of-the-art special effects than the sometimes cheesy ones on view here. That said ""Red Tails -- a welcome change from Hollywoods historic January dumping ground -- is lot more fun to sit through than Steven Spielbergs pretentious self-important ""War Horse.""

Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard. Directed by Anthony Hemingway. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Tuskegee Airmen the trailblazing African American pilots who fought off segregation and Nazis during World War II merit a great film. ""Red Tails"" isnt it. All the components are there a big budget an appealing cast a George Lucas producing credit and fancy visual effects plus the energy and eagerness of talented people thrilled to be telling a rich historical story. It boasts flashes of humor and a few sharp blasts of high-altitude action. Whats missing is any hint of realism. Theres no grit to it anywhere. The dogfight scenes soar too cleanly and obviously on the wings of CGI. The characters all of them equipped with the usual beefs and foibles might have been snipped from a catalog. And the dialogue bad. ""Die you foolish African"" rasps the films lone villain a German pilot furnished with a compulsory sneer and cheek scar. Equally cartoonish are the lines spat out by supporting characters so wooden and hokey they sound like those Stormtroopers from Lucas ""Star Wars."" The central plot concerns the airmens fight for respect funding and decent assignments from Washington where Terrence Howard playing a colonel periodically huffs at them with his invincible charisma. Back in Italy a kindly major played by Cuba Gooding Jr. oversees the talented but frustrated men of the 332 Fighter Group. Their purpose is to inject a little sexiness into the plot. Goodings purpose is to chomp on an unlit pipe. Almost everyone elses purpose is to state the obvious at regular intervals; this is the sort of movie where a man having passed out immediately wakes up and yells ""I must have passed out"" Related Stories Review Red Tails Red Tails heroic but missing realism Pioneering heroes deserve better film Television writer John Ridley (""The Wanda Sykes Show"") and comic-strip creator Aaron McGruder (""Boondocks"") must shoulder the blame for the screenplay but the stilted pacing and overall wishy-washiness of the drama must be ascribed to director Anthony Hemingway. Hemingway a TV veteran making the leap to the big screen seems stuck in the land of boxy close-ups. For all its zooming aerobatics theres something small earthbound and unambitious about ""Red Tails"" (titled for the squads distinctive paint) as though everyone chose the easiest possible path to the climax. What a shame that is. Because men this proud - and a tale this heroic - deserve a better movie. E-mail Amy Biancolli at datebookletterssfchronicle.com.

Between 1943 and 1945 they shot down more than 100 German aircraft and Red Tails means to honor the brave pilots. But it ends up giving them short shrift with a cliched and leaden story.This tribute to an important chapter in history would have benefited by delving deeper beneath the surface of what these intrepid men faced from the militarys then-entrenched racism. A scene in an officers club offers a superficial glimpse of the bigotry as do a few clashes with officers higher up the chain of command. STORY George Lucas Red Tails salutes Tuskegee AirmenVIDEO George Lucas talks Red TailsBut more context such as details about the Tuskegee Ala. institute that trained the fliers and more about the pre-war lives of the individual pilots would have made it more powerful.The best performances are not always by the biggest names. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a one-dimensional commanding officer whose most distinguishing characteristic is his constant pipe-smoking. Terrence Howard is multi-layered in a low-key but defiant role as the colonel who faces off against top military brass and fights for his squadron to be kept aloft.But the actors whose character arcs leave a bigger imprint are the flying aces in the 332nd Fighter Group the all-black unit based at Italys Ramitelli Airfield.David Oyelowo stands out as the daredevil Joe ""Lightning"" Little the units best flier. With his bravery and bravado hes the films most complex character.Nate Parker plays Marty ""Easy"" Julian who drinks to cope with the pressure of leading the fliers. The film produced by George Lucas and directed by Anthony Hemingway (The Wire) is paced at just the right pitch to maintain excitement without becoming frenetic. But its only half of a good movie. As soon as those dogfighting planes land the story trips up by skimming the surface of history. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

If George Lucas is to be believed (and theres no reason he shouldnt be) ""Red Tails is a movie no Hollywood studio wants us to see. Lucas complains to Bryan Curtis in this Sundays New York Times Magazine that an action movie about the storied Tuskegee Airmen - black pilots who flew and fought with distinction in World War II - just wasnt important to executives. He held a screening and none came. So he says he wound up paying for the entire movie himself. This is depressing news for several reasons.First if George Lucas cant persuade a film studio to humor him and take a look at a movie then who can? Second the Times story then lists the raves from the black luminaries who attended a private screening. One former Airman implored every African-American to see ""Red Tails and Al Sharpton offered a qualified assessment when he exclaimed ""Its probably one of the best movies Ive ever seenAll of which brings me to the other depressing thing about this film which opens today years after other peoples attempts to get an Airmen story told. It puts audiences once again in the annoying position of having to run out and support something that isnt very good. So you root for ""Red Tails which Anthony Hemingway directed because it wants to do right by history and the stories of these men. You do not root for it because it does anything with those stories thats new or powerful or deep or even reliably entertaining. The screenplay is credited to John Ridley and the cartoonist Aaron McGruder and it plunks us down in Italy on the all-black air base of the 332d Fighter Group where the men are a handsome close-knit assortment of cardboard types played by a likable young cast.Nate Parker is the upright mission leader. David Oyelowo is the hothead and ladies man. Tristan Wilds is The Kid. And several other actors share the job of comic relief. Marcus T. Paulk might not even be going for comedy but his sole quirk is a ratty picture of a Black Jesus that he constantly prays to by name and it always gets a laugh. So does whatever cornpone accent the singer Ne-Yo is going for. Theyre all on the ground just long enough for Oyelowos hothead Joe ""Lightning Little to take over the movie. He has a bar fight falls in love with an Italian woman (Daniela Ruah) and bickers with Parkers character Marty ""Easy Julian. Easy wants Lightning to calm down and listen to his commands in the air. Lightning wants Marty to stop drinking while aviating. Some of these scenes are sweet. Many of them play like outtakes from Robert Townsends piquant movie-racism satire ""Hollywood Shuffle. (""The sky is blue Wildss character says ""and my guns are hot) The Airmen want to see combat but are routinely assigned so-called escort missions in which they chaperone white pilots and their bombers to their targets. Here that also means fending off attacks from German planes and taking out speeding trains and boats. These air scenes are conducted in the generic spirit of old Saturday matinees. That feels like a distinctly Lucas touch. But most of the flight scenes bog down the movie. If we get one shot of brown faces with black flight masks we must get a thousand and few of these actors is brilliant enough to act his way past that.More important the movies real drama is more political than military. It doesnt want to get hung up on the second-class status put upon the Airmen but tasks its biggest stars - Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. - with demanding equality and instilling pride all the same.Howard especially seems burdened with responsibility. Whenever he speaks its as if he might never get the chance again. He and Oyelowo evoke different aspects of the old Sidney Poitier dilemma Howard in his intense dignity Oyelowo in his attempt to turn his natural British accent American and loose. The sight of Howard denouncing racism in uniform while seated at the Pentagon carries a gust of uplift. But it would be dishonest to say that hes better here than he was as a rapping pimp. For any actor down and dirty is more fun than pressed and starched. But pressed-and-starched is all this movie can afford to be.Spike Lee paid a similar tribute to black World War II soldiers with ""Miracle at St. Anna. But the movie was too defensive to entirely work. Incidentally the Times article mentions that if ""Red Tails is a hit maybe Lee can shoot a prequel which means the movie is ultimately a hypothetical coming attraction. Either way its nice to have it. There arent enough depictions of black heroism. But this story or the many others of the Tuskegee Airmen one could tell deserves a cable-television series or a truly great movie angle.This treatment is pure to the point of being evasive. It has character but no characters. Understandably the filmmakers didnt want to make ""Top Gunz although ""Red Tails has its moments. Theyve just gone too far in the other direction. The movie is so desperate to be palatable to appeal to everybody that it doesnt taste like anything.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris.

A black ops super agent seeks payback after she is betrayed and set up during a mission. Video courtesy Relativity Media. By Joe Morgenstern January 20 2012 In a movie thats basically about watching a formidable female run kick and punch her way through a world of treacherous males one of the best exchanges comes when her betrayer orders a dapper assassin to terminate her. ""Ive never done a woman before"" the designated killer says to which the other guy replies ""You shouldnt think of her as being a woman."" Good advice given her awesome prowess but how should we think of Mallory Kane the special-ops agent played by Gina Carano a mixed martial-arts virtuoso making her feature debut? As a fighting machine one that registers ambient danger with all the efficiency of The Terminator and the light irony of James Bond but also as a beautifully seductive construction at the center of a film that is itself an elegant machine. Theres no deeper meaning to Steven Soderberghs thriller than what meets the eye yet its lustrous surfaces offer great and guilt-free pleasure. ENLARGE Gina Carano and Ewan McGregor in Haywire. Relativity Media The story starts in upstate New York then moves to Barcelona Dublin New Mexico and Washington. The plot--basically betrayal followed by payback--pits Mallory against the unprincipled security contractor shes been working for plus all of his shadowy minions. The action isnt nonstop no matter what the trailer makes you think. Some of the most satisfying stretches come when something is about to happen as in a very long and ominous tracking shot that follows Mallory down a Dublin sidewalk across the street from St. Stephens Green. (Mr. Soderbergh directing from a script by Lem Dobbs did his own cinematography which is richly understated when the colors arent morphing into interludes of grainy black-and-white or baleful ocher.) When something does happen its usually a violent confrontation between Mallory and her baselessly confident adversaries. In at least two instances she visits unusual pain and suffering on their genitals but thats far from the only page in her playbook of righteous mayhem. Most of her moves are the ones Ms. Carano deploys in the relatively new arena of womens mixed martial arts except that here in the arena of mainstream action thrillers the newly minted movie star must do more than dabble in the dramatic arts. So how does she do? Really well all things considered meaning that most movie performances are constructed from discrete pieces and this one is no exception; that her sultry voice may be a discreetly enhanced version of the one she uses in real life and that her character by the nature of the special-ops trade finds her finest expression in exuberant physicality. It remains to be seen whether Ms. Caranos star presence will take her beyond action roles but shes certainly appealing in this one and very much at home in a strong cast that includes Michael Fassbender Ewan McGregor Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas Channing Tatum Bill Paxton and Michael Angarano. Keep an eye out too for a deer but not in anyones headlights. Miss Bala Watch a clip of ""Miss Bala"" a story of a young woman clinging on to her dream to become a beauty contest queen in a Mexico dominated by organized crime. Video courtesy of Fox. No beauty contest has ever been more bizarre than the one in Gerardo Naranjos shockingly powerful thriller in Spanish with English subtitles. The tearful winner Laura (Stephanie Sigman) a 23-year-old innocent from Tijuana is crowned Miss Baja even though sheer terror has kept her from saying a single word to the audience or smiling a genuine smile. The source of her paralysis isnt stage fright but fear for her life. Through no fault of her own Laura has fallen into the clutches of a Baja California narco gang that engineered her hollow triumph. (The ironic title means ""Miss Bullet."") Mr. Naranjo a gifted filmmaker who wrote the film with Mauricio Katz never insists on symbols--theres too much action and suspense for that--but its irresistible to see his heroine as a stand-in for her beautiful country increasingly a hostage to savage crime. ENLARGE Stephanie Sigman in Miss Bala. 2oth Century Fox This is a remarkable film with a strong performance in the title role. Ms. Sigman whose beauty would shine in any contest is only a couple of years older than the character she plays and her professional experience is limited; she came to acting by way of modeling. Still she energizes every scene shes in i.e. every scene in the movie which never for a moment loses track of her or fails to show the action from Lauras point of view. And the action as designed by Mr. Naranjo and his cinematographer Matyas Erdely has a disjunct quality that borders on the surreal. Street battles break out without warning setting thugs armed to the teeth against cops coming on like special-forces commandos. During lulls in the action the Estrella gangs trucks and SUVs course through city streets in motorcades that avoid police checkpoints with the help of spotters on cellphones. Its impossible for Laura to know whats happening around her whats going to happen next or whos on which side. In fact she wouldnt have been forced into doing the gangs bidding if she hadnt enlisted the help of a crooked cop. ""Miss Bala"" is a portrait of a young woman who is at once terribly vulnerable and improbably brave. Its equally a vision of a vulnerable society on the road to anarchy. Coriolanus In taking on one of Shakespeares more opaque plays for his directorial debut Ralph Fiennes emulates the hero he portrays a refractory Roman general Caius Martius ""Coriolanus"" for whom compromise equals surrender. But Martius comes to a bad end while Mr. Fiennes achieves a great beginning. As a director his grasp exceeds his daring reach and his performance stands as a chilling exemplar of psychomartial ferocity. The setting is contemporary give or take a decade. Ancient Rome has become a modern city where hungry citizens rioting for grain are dispersed by troops wielding automatic weapons and where TV news shows broadcast frequent updates of the Roman armys bloody campaign against its Volscian enemies--if it bleeds it leads indeed. But Shakespeares English is still spoken with a clarity that results from the pace that Mr. Fiennes has set for himself and his fellow actors--deliberate sometimes to the point of verbal slo-mo yet so charged with feeling as to sound like conversation that only happens to flow forth in iambic pentameter. The modern dress works well. What might have been a stunt emphasizes the military aspects of the play--those automatic weapons dont exclude mano a mano combat with knives--and intensifies the domestic drama that might have seemed more remote had it been cloaked in gowns and togas. Thats not to suggest that the film is instantly accessible. It takes a while assuming a willingness to invest the effort before you can tune into the marvelous language then get beyond it to concentrate on revelations of character. But riches of character are revealed with copious visual invention. (The cinematographer Barry Ackroyd who shot last weeks thriller ""Contraband"" fills ""Coriolanus"" with startling images.) Mr. Fienness Martius head shaven and covered with blood becomes a cautionary character a rigid soldier ill-suited to civic affairs. Martius takes pleasure in his towering vanity refuses to conceal his scorn for the common people hates his enemies with a naked passion that inspires awe. The cast includes Vanessa Redgrave as the heros mother Volumnia alongside whom todays tiger moms seem toothless; Jessica Chastain as his ardent wife Virgilia; Gerard Butler as Tullus Aufidius his mortal enemy and Brian Cox as the accommodating senator Menenius. They are superb every one of them. Red Tails Watch a clip of Cuba Gooding Jr.s latest film ""Red Tails"". A crew of African American pilots in the Tuskegee training program having faced segregation while kept mostly on the ground during World War II are called into duty under the guidance of Col. A.J. Bullard. No story from World War II is more deserving of a great movie than that of the Tuskegee Airmen. A squadron of Negro fighter pilots they struggled against white prejudice for a chance to prove themselves in combat and succeeded brilliantly winning nearly 100 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Then they returned to civilian life in a nation still gripped by Jim Crow. Few stories have followed a longer path to the big screen than ""Red Tails"" which was ignored by the studios for decades until according to its producer George Lucas he decided to make it with his own money. The end result is not a great movie but a deeply misconceived one that tells the story with a comic-book sensibility--""Die you foolish African"" snarls a Messerschmitt pilot--and a videogame approach to the visual effects. (Anthony Hemingway directed broadly from a truly foolish script by John Ridley and Aaron McGruder. Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. head the cast.) One could argue that the target audience--black teenagers Mr. Lucas has said--might be most receptive to a film that conveys history through contemporary entertainment. But this isnt contemporary entertainment its antiquated kitsch reprocessed by the producers nostalgia for the movies of his boyhood. The story has been stripped of historical context--dont black teenagers and everyone else deserve hard facts?--and internal logic. (How for example are the initially demoralized and undisciplined members of the squadron able to best the Luftwaffe in early encounters?) Whats left is a collection of war-movie cliches; a wartime Italian setting that looks weirdly idyllic if not quite prosperous; sappy interludes of romance between one of the fliers and a pretty village girl; a hapless borrowing from ""Stalag 17"" and computer-generated aerial sequences that in their whiz-bang wondrousness have lost every connection with authenticity. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Limey (1999) Steven Soderbergh directed and Lem Dobbs wrote this slyly funny spasmodically violent film noir in which the title character a white-haired obsessive named Wilson (Terence Stamp) shows up in Los Angeles to avenge his daughters death. Like Elliott Goulds Philip Marlowe in ""The Long Goodbye"" Wilson cant comprehend the glittering new culture that surrounds him mistaking valet car-parkers for uniformed troops in a gangsters private army. I couldnt comprehend how the star was able to look as young as he did in flashbacks of Wilson in his twenties. See the film first then search online for the secret. Richard III (1995) This rousing version directed by Richard Loncraine relocates the play to a fictional fascist England of the mid-1930s that suggests some surreal convergence of Sir Oswald Mosleys blackshirts with the sumptuous decadence of Bernardo Bertoluccis ""The Conformist."" Ian McKellen makes Richards malignity sexy. His voice may not be as oaken as Richard Burtons was or as burnished as John Gielguds but its a beautifully modulated instrument with its own somber music. His long face punctuated by a pencil mustache is a place of jowls creases and inflammation. Also with Maggie Smith Nigel Hawthorne Kristin Scott Thomas and Robert Downey Jr. Battle of Britain (1969) As historical drama its imperfect but watch the phenomenal aerial sequences and youll see whats missing from the digital effects in ""Red Tails."" This production under the direction of Guy Hamilton pulled together a veritable international air force of authentic airplanes in flying condition--British Spitfires and Hurricanes versus German Messerschmitt 109s Heinkel 111s and Junkers 52s. The cast is fairly dazzling too--Michael Caine Trevor Howard Laurence Olivier Christopher Plummer Harry Andrews Curt Jurgens Michael Redgrave Ralph Richardson Robert Shaw Kenneth More and Susannah York to name just a notable few.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 The story of the Tuskegee Airmen - the African American pilots of World War II fame - is a great one full of heroism in the air and on the ground. The irony of battling fascism overseas and then returning to racism at home - not to mention the prejudice they experienced in the military - was not lost on these men who proved their mettle on countless aerial combat missions even while many inside the Pentagon doubted their skills. Slideshow Red Tails offers stirring action but stick figures Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Red Tails >> Red Tails which begins with a damning epigram from a 1925 War College study (""blacks are inferior to whites in every way"") sets out to honor these heroes and does so - but in ways that reduce their achievements to the stuff of cartoons. A long-borning George Lucas project (hes been trying to get studio backing for more than 20 years) Red Tails like Star Wars is full of vintage war movie tropes the reckless flyboys the hard-drinking squadron captain the evil nemeses and their deadly fighting machines. . . . And when the Tuskegee crew based in Italy finally gets the chance to fly new snub-nosed P-51 Mustangs - replacing their old winged jalopies patched together with tape and gum - they take to the skies and take down the smug Aryans in their Messerschmitts. The dogfighting sequences full of crisscrossing bullets-blazing action are rendered with digital precision - theyre exhilarating. The camera zooms in on the pilots - guys with nicknames like ""Smoky"" and ""Lightning"" and ""Easy"" - then cuts away to crisp CG shots of planes arching up into the clouds diving down on Nazi supply trains and warships. ""How do you like that Mr. Hitler"" exclaims one of the pilots after blowing up a German boat. Its not just the combat dialogue thats simplistic - and jingoistic (the word Lucas himself used when he was on Jon Stewarts show last week). Red Tails addresses segregation within the ranks of the U.S. Army Air Corps with similar one-dimensionality. The first time the squadron is assigned to escort a bombing run the (white) pilots of the bombers take a look at the dark-skinned faces in the fighter cockpits alongside and essentially resign themselves to doom. After the Tuskegee squad completes its run protecting the bombers and shooting down Nazis the same pilot says something golly-geeish like ""hope we see those guys again"" And then back on the ground they invite the black airmen for a drink - in the whites-only officers club. Presto change-o centuries of racism vanquished. But Lucas along with his director Anthony Hemingway and their writers wanted it this way. Red Tails is an action movie first full of head-spinning video game-like aerial acrobatics and artillery fire and a history lesson second. Thats why the characters are fictional composites of Tuskegee Airmen Theres Joe ""Lightning"" Little (David Oyelowo) who falls for a lovely Italian girl (Daniela Ruah) he first sees on a fly-over; theres Marty ""Easy"" Julian (Nate Parker) the squadron leader whos been dousing his nerves in whiskey; theres Ray ""Junior"" Gannon (Tristan Wilds) the wide-eyed kid of the bunch; and there are Maj. Stance (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who cant give a mission brief without sticking a pipe in his face and Col. Bullard (Terrence Howard) who is back in D.C. combating the bigots among the brass (Breaking Bads Bryan Cranston is the worst offender). There isnt a real flesh-and-blood figure in the bunch. Everything about Red Tails - the breaking down of racial barriers the military achievements the courage and sacrifice - is diminished in the process.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In the segregated military of World War II the all-black Tuskegee Airmen take on a crucial mission. BOTTOM LINE This Lucasfilm production turns World War II into one long loud ""Star Wars"" battle and the amateurish acting and direction dont help. CAST Cuba Gooding Jr. Nate Parker David Oyelowo Terrence Howard LENGTH 205 There is a regrettable moment near the end of ""Red Tails"" a drama inspired by the all-black Tuskegee Airmen of World War II. It comes when the Airmen considered genetically incapable of bravery by the U.S. military fly directly toward the enemy. A Nazi pilot screams in German and the subtitle reads thusly ""Die you foolish African"" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? This bizarre line one of the most howlingly awful Ive encountered in a major motion picture marked the moment I finally lost patience with ""Red Tails."" Despite the movies obvious good intentions -- and lavish production by George Lucas Lucasfilm -- it suffers from an amateurishness and overall tone-deafness that extends to more than just German translation. We can start with the script by Aaron McGruder (""The Boondocks"") and John Ridley (""Three Kings"") which mixes historical fact with comic-strip cliches. The stock characters include daredevil pilot Lightning (David Oyelowo) the buttoned-down Easy (Nate Parker) and interchangeable others with names like Junior (Tristan Wilds) Smokey (the singer Ne-Yo) and Joker (Elijah Kelley). The films best actors get the worst roles Terrence Howard is the steely Colonel Bullard and Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the pipe-chomping Major Stance. More disheartening is director Anthony Hemingways videogame approach to a real war. Planes swirl around like the X-Wing fighters in ""Star Wars"" (Industrial Light amp; Magic did the effects) and everyone seems to be having great fun As German soldiers are blown to bits and burn to death the Airmen zoom away hooting with laughter. VideoTrailer Red Tails Even the films acknowledgment of racism seems inconsistent White generals say horrible things to their black underlings but one Airmans romance with an Italian woman (Daniela Ruah) doesnt raise an eyebrow. ""Red Tails"" has genuine admiration for the sacrifices and achievements made by the Tuskegee Airmen but they deserve a better commemoration than this. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT In the segregated military of World War II the all-black Tuskegee Airmen take on a crucial mission.

They sacrificed for their country during an era when they were not allowed in officers clubs. Cant you taste the cinematic potential? This is exactly the kind of story of glory-glory-hallelujah bravery and perseverance youd expect from a filmmaker like Steven Spielberg. Alas it was George Lucas who became captivated by the Tuskegee Airmen and has after many years as devoted producer managed to turn their story into a feature film that falls much closer to the goofy Hogans Heroes in the spectrum of World War II-focused productions than Saving Private Ryan. He didnt direct - that task fell to a young black director named Anthony Hemingway whose credits include episodes of The Wire and Treme - but the gee whiz stamp of Lucas is all over Red Tails. Tons of flying action to send small boys into paroxysms of joy dialogue of almost exquisite hamminess a tale of good and evil and really not much more. There are no subtle moments in this production. Heres what happens the first time the trusty Red Tails (the tails of their planes are painted bright red) show up to escort a group of American bombers in a mission Pilot 1 peering out the cockpit window spotting cute Ray ""Junior"" Gannon (Tristan Wilds) the baby-faced pilot dipping his wings at him. He observes that Ray is ""colored."" ""What the hell are we going to do?"" he asks Pilot 2. Despite the best efforts of Lucass Industrial Light amp; Magic (a pioneer in special effects mind you) this conversation and every other allegedly sky bound exchange in Red Tails looks like its taking place three feet off the ground on a green-screened set. ""I dont think our fighter escort is going to be much help this trip"" Pilot 2 responds grimly as if the war were suddenly all but lost. (READ George Lucas Wants to Retire and Make Art Films. Sure He Does.) The Red Tails including squadron leader Marty  ""Easy"" Julian (Nate Parker) and his roommate and best buddy Joe ""Lightning"" Little (David Oyelowo who has the look of a man who will effortlessly cast off this lame movie and move gracefully into better ones including Spielbergs Lincoln slated for release next Christmas) selflessly guide the bombers safely along on their perilous journey even taking out a couple of Nazi planes along the way. By this point in the movie its easy to be fond of all of them; theyre a pleasant bunch although they dont deviate even the slightest bit from the old fashioned war movie stereotypes troubled drunk with a chip on his shoulder hotshot goofy guy obvious martyr etc. After the bombing mission farewells are then exchanged in the sky and the Red Tails aka the 332 Fighter Group head back to their home base on Italys Adriatic Coast. They have shown the idiotic Pilots 1 and 2 how it is done. They have driven Mr. and Mr. Daisy and stood by courteously while bombs were dropped. ""We didnt lose a single plane. Wow thats a first"" says Pilot 1. ""I hope we meet up with those Red Tails next time"" chimes in Pilot 2. In its falsity and clumsy exposition Red Tailss dialogue has all the grace of a margarine commercial and for much of the movie Easy Lightning Junior and their other colleagues including Joker (Elijah Kelley) and Smokey (Ramp;B star Ne-Yo) seem like products being pitched to tried and true butter lovers. Every doubter is persuaded eventually of course because this is a feel-good movie about overcoming racism. Not the hissing Nazis though; they just get shot down. War is not hell in Red Tails. Its more like a chance to go all Top Gun or fall in love (theres an Italian girl who speaks no English but has mastered the language of amore) or earn the respect of your fellow pilots black and white alike. The damage is minimal. Even when someone is injured or dies on screen it seems gentle a trickle of blood some fluttering eyelids and murmurs of ""Im getting dizzy"" or ""help me black Jesus."" With its aw shucks it all works out in the end approach to race relations Red Tails would seem likely to infuriate as many people as The Help did except for a key distinction. This isnt a movie about white people helping black people achieve their potential. The white members of the military brass (particularly the general played by Breaking Bads Bryan Cranston) do everything they can to make it harder for the 332nd Fighter Group to succeed including giving them the most decrepit planes they can find. Not only do the Tuskegee Airmen not have anyone like The Helps Skeeter speaking for them even when they get praise its grudging and laughably insensitive. ""I guess theres a lot more to you coloreds than I thought"" says a white POW at Stalag 18 to one of the Tuskegee Airman who has the misfortune to land behind enemy lines and then proves handy to an all-too easily executed Great Escape-style operation. Instead the Red Tails have two proud black men on their sides their commanding officers Major Stance (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Colonel Bullard (Terrence Howard). (Both actors have some Tuskegee experience under their belts Gooding Jr. was in HBOs 1995 movie The Tuskegee Airmen and Howard played a Tuskegee Airman held captive in a German POW camp in Harts War. Next time the topic of limited roles for black actors in Hollywood films come up consider that coincidence; its a small world without many parts.) The Colonel in particular will bristle at a racist superior or give an inspirational speech at the drop of a hat. The Major is usually too busy clenching his pipe between his teeth to say much of anything but Gooding has mastered gazing up into the sky with a concerned look. Hes an Oscar winner by the way and Howard an Oscar nominee (Hustle amp; Flow) just in case you forgot which the cheesiness of Red Tails could very easily make you do. Such rich history such poor execution. Lucas has once again -- he does this just every time he releases anything new -- threatened to retire from making big movies. Why cant he just retire from making bad movies?

It also could have been written in the 40s as all the stock World War II movie characters get dusted off and trotted out. Red Tails Fair to good Director Anthony Hemingway. Cast Nate Parker David Oyelowo Terrence Howard Cuba Gooding Jr. Tristan Wilds Ne-Yo. Rating PG-13 for war violence. World War II films You want a hard-drinking leader? Check. A reckless daredevil? Present. A comic wise guy? Bingo. Heck theres even a wet-behind-the-ears kid who everyone affectionately calls Junior. Interview Cuba Gooding Jr. The movie takes all these hoary cliches and presents them without any trace of irony or self-awareness. Its as if we are living in a world in which thoughtful war films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" never existed. Perhaps the movies most surprising feat? Somehow the darned thing mostly works probably because its heart is in the right place. Inspired by the true story of the Tuskegee Airmen a group of African-American pilots who battled both the Nazis and racism the films sincerity and good intentions shine through the hokum. Produced by George Lucas and directed by first-timer Anthony Hemingway the movie boasts dizzying flight sequences that may bring the battle scenes in ""Stars Wars"" to mind. They are quite thrilling even when the airmen spout dialogue along the lines of ""How do you like that Mr. Hitler?"" The acting is generally strong with particularly solid turns coming from charismatic Nate Parker and David Oyelowo as the two pilots who get the most screen time. Even when the corn gets thick -- their characters are nicknamed Easy and Lightning respectively -- the performers manage to keep the whole thing grounded in reality. Not so fortunate is Cuba Gooding Jr. badly cast as a stern Army Air Forces major named Stance who walks around with a pipe clenched between his teeth. He looks so awkward that you expect the pipe to come tumbling out of his mouth at any second. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

PG-13 Aerial explosions. At area theaters. The story of the Tuskegee Airmen the African-American pilots in World War II with red paint on their planes who stood strong to break a barrier segregating troops requires a fiery gusto missing from ""Red Tails."" George Lucas produced this candy-coated fictionalized drama and while its cast is first-rate and its flying sequences sharp the movie is as glazed and wide-eyed as a 70-year-old comic book. In 1944 the African-American flyers of the 332nd Fighter Group are stationed in Italy part of ""the Tuskegee experiment"" as the media calls it Black soldiers once deemed unfit for combat fighting alongside white troops. From the top-brass meetings where a general (Terrence Howard) endures institutionalized racism to the clouds where transport pilots worry if the 332nd can hold off German fighter planes the struggle is constant. Led by an avuncular commanding officer (Cuba Gooding Jr. with a MacArthur-like pipe stuck in the side of his mouth) the 332nd fliers prove themselves in air battles earning new planes to replace their junky B-40s the nickname ""Red Tails"" and respect. The group which includes Joker (Elijah Kelley) Easy (Nate Parker) and Ray Gun (Tristan Wilds) is made up of 1940s-era movie cliches their names emblazoned on their planes. Stealing the movie though are the cynical Smoky (Ne-Yo) and the earnest Lightning (David Oyelowo). The broad-strokes style of producer Lucas weighs heavily on director Anthony Hemingway. The air seems as crowded with planes as the spaceports in a ""Star Wars"" prequel. Dialogue is delivered in declarative shouts and nuance-free yells and theres an out-of-nowhere segment in which a pilot apparently parachutes smack-dab into ""The Great Escape"" (teleporting into the Steve McQueen character in the process). While the CGI aerial warfare is thrilling all the pilot chatter is annoying. And though the megasuccessful mainstreamer Lucas clearly didnt want to make a film as serious as ""Glory"" it didnt have to be as spiffy and whitewashed as Michael Bays ""Pearl Harbor.""

"Red Tails (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Red Tails (PG-13) A timid film about brave men. Share Print Save to your profile By Colin Covert Minneapolis Star Tribune1/19/2012 Editor rating 2 Red Tails never takes off. The subject matter -- the trials and triumphs of the first all-black U.S. Army Air Corps fighter group nicknamed the Tuskegee Airmen -- is new. Yet the film has no story to tell that Hollywood hasnt told before. Its derivative of other World War II movies and entirely mechanical in its appeal. Emphatically mainstream in style and substance it honors those exceptional fliers but denies viewers a challenging portrait of our own history. Tuskegees segregated airmen proved themselves against the best the Luftwaffe had including new fighter jets. They shredded the U.S. militarys assumption that African Americans were not equal to the rigors of serving in a highly technical combat arm. But this movie -- a longtime pet project of executive producer George Lucas -- isnt about people its about airplanes. The slickly filmed aerial sequences directed by longtime TV veteran Anthony Hemingway are engrossing and well-staged; you never lose track of whos who in the sky. Filmed combat has an almost indestructible appeal. When the action moves into the bunkhouse however or to a wooden flirtation between one of the fliers and a bella signorina living near their Italian airbase the film goes into a nosedive. The best of the one-note performances is Terrence Howards as the fliers commander. His verbal skirmishes with a racist senior officer (Bryan Cranston) would probably have had him up on charges of insubordination but his brooding intensity gives the film its few moments of dramatic power. As his pipe-chomping second-in-command Cuba Gooding Jr. is as flavorless as water. The elements of John Ridleys undistinguished screenplay are relentlessly old-school right down to a German wing commander who instructs his pilots to ""Show no mercy."" The U.S. fliers are thinly characterized (the gung-ho youngster the secret drinker the romantic) their barracks life an intense Boy Scout atmosphere of virtue loyalty and fraternal love. Fighting for their country is their utmost desire and from all evidence virtually their only activity. There are some losses on the American side but the consequences of flesh meeting shrapnel are downplayed. Combat death here is sentimental not horrific. At every turn the film pulls its punches. Please. We can take it. The only real surprise here is how resolutely apolitical the film is. In 2008 Spike Lees Miracle at St. Anna followed the men of an all-black infantry unit through the Italian campaign of 1944. His film extended long past V-E Day deepening the story by showing how the men who won the war lost the peace. We know that life for the Tuskegee veterans was no picnic after the tickertape was swept away and I would have respected this film if it had followed them through their subsequent battles as civilians. Red Tails is not the film they deserve. It is a timid film about brave men. Cast Terrence Howard Cuba Gooding Jr. Bryan Cranston. Director Anthony Hemingway. Screenwriters John Ridley Aaron McGruder. Producer Rick McCallum. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 120 minutes. War violence. Opens Friday Jan. 20 at area theaters.

Exec producer George Lucas spent 23 years developing ""Red Tails"" a glossed-up B picture about the exploits of the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II but even without the long delay the project took to reach the screen the result would have felt old-fashioned. Apart from the occasional thrill provided by CG-enhanced aerial dogfights this stuffy history lesson about the groundbreaking African-American fighter pilot division never quite takes off weighed down by wooden characters and leaden screenwriting. Commercially speaking while the subject and minority-led cast should be selling points to appreciative black auds the pics limiting factor will be its overly square execution. Though overseen by Lucas ""Red Tails"" marks the feature debut of director Anthony Hemingway an experienced TV helmer who counts episodes of ""The Wire"" and ""Treme"" among his many credits. Here the scale is larger but the narrative opportunities more limited boxed in by the two-hour running time. Thus the ensemble is limited primarily to personality traits established in the films opening minutes with most of the attention split between by-the-book college boy Marty ""Easy"" Julian (Nate Parker carrying himself like a young Denzel Washington) who serves as squad leader and daredevil best friend Joe ""Lightning"" Little (David Oyelowo who cant help mugging for the camera). The film opens midair as a scarred German pilot (Lars van Riesen) leads an attack on a fleet of U.S. Army bombers. The American fighters have been trained for the kill leaving the larger craft theyre escorting vulnerable as they zip off to pursue the Nazi attackers. What the military needs are pilots who can put personal glory aside to protect the bombers giving the Tuskegee flyers a chance to prove their worth at the likely expense of their own lives -- suggesting the potential for dramatic sacrifice displayed by the all-black regiment in ""Glory."" But instead of emphasizing the casualties suffered by the 332nd Fighter Group (66 deaths in all of which only two are depicted) ""Red Tails"" celebrates the teams collective heroism. If a 1925 U.S. Army survey found that so-called ""colored personnel"" were ""unfit for military service"" the film demonstrates how the 332nd proved otherwise on the strength of its achievements drawing inspiration from John B. Holways book ""Red Tails Black Wings The Men of Americas Black Air Force"" (the title refers to the planes signature markings). Time and again the film conveys how racist bureaucrats intended the experiment to fail at a time when segregation was the norm. Though the U.S. Army Air Corps trained nearly 1000 black pilots in Tuskegee Ala. once in the field the military equipped them with rundown planes and assigned them low-profile missions far behind enemy lines (seamless visual effects allow the Prague-based shoot to simulate Italian locations). Despite such setbacks Lightning is itching for combat frequently disobeying orders whenever the chance to score an enemy kill arises as in a neat singlehanded showdown between him and a German supply train early in the film. These airborne scenes are frequently dazzling cutting between the cockpits of the various pilots (a la ""Star Wars"") and the broader canvas against which fancy loops and spins take place. Still for all their visual polish such maneuvers lack the thrill of practical stuntwork. By sheer coincidence Paramount recently restored William Wellmans 1927 Oscar winner ""Wings"" whose aerial acrobatics set the gold standard for such sequences on film. ""Red Tails"" by contrast feels as if it were shot against greenscreens and rendered on an elaborate videogame engine one that knows to gild every cloud with rosy pink edges and supply the appropriate roaring-engine effects to create the illusion of flight. With such an approach the characters become secondary; a far more effective strategy might have been to tell a compelling personality-driven story that just so happened to take place among the Tuskegee Airmen. In fact an earlier HBO telepic did better with the human-interest material even if it lacked Lucas tools for high-flying action sequences. Leading a cast of lesser-known black actors the films two biggest stars Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. play officers angling to book a mission significant enough for the 332nd to distinguish itself but that limits their dramatic potential to terse meetings with military brass (including a crotchety Bryan Cranston). What the film needs are actors with charisma in the air and enough unfinished business on the ground that it matters whether they land safely.

Some of the action is fun. But if something about that statement doesnt sound right well theres your chief problem with ""Red Tails."" It sets out to ingratiate without provocation or complexity."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt;This much can be said of producer George Lucas long-gestating project It avoids the aggravating Hollywood strategy of telling an African-American story by way of a mass-marketable white protagonist a la the Civil War drama ""Glory.""But Lucas has overseen a movie divided against itself part ""Clone Wars""-aesthetic kicks part dutiful sociology. The script confining the action to 1944 Italy places the occasional grown-up sentiment in a characters mouth as when one member of the 332nd Fighter Group tells another ""Dont be in a hurry to get to the killing part."" Yet the movie cant wait to get to the killing part rendered here in computer-generated aerial dogfights a little too in love with the available filmmaking technology and a little too uninterested in the characters doing the shooting.The focus is on a fictional group of men stationed at Ramitelli Airfield. Hard-drinking squadron leader ""Easy"" Julian (Nate Parker) is the by-the-book contrast to his best friend the Jedi whiz of the bunch Joe ""Lightning"" Little (David Oyelowo). Coffee the chief mechanic is played by Andre Royo one of several supporting players who worked with director Anthony Hemingway on ""The Wire."" (Lucas himself directed the reshoots.) The marquee names belong to Terrence Howard andCuba Gooding Jr. offering complementary portraits in unflappable leadership as a proud colonel and a pipe-smoking major respectively.Producer Lucas director Hemingway and his writers John Ridley and ""Boondocks"" creator Aaron McGruder arent going for serious business here. As McGruder said in the films promotional materials ""Red Tails"" offers ""a comic-book feel that only George Lucas could bring to a film."" He added ""Before this we didnt have our John Wayne but we now have that kind of larger-than-life treatment and the Tuskegee Airmen deserve it.""Yes and they also deserve some dramatic vitality and plausibility. If you go to ""Red Tails"" to learn anything (even heavily fictionalized things) about the origin of the Tuskegee Airmen or the workaday racism they had to endure you will be disappointed. When Howards defiant colonel upbraids the Pentagon brass about their disdain for his men the sequence is straight out of a comic book per co-writer McGruders description. But if we cant believe a scene such as this one would ever have happened that way not in a million Earth years then theres no real gratification in it.Little romances a local beauty while Julian loses faith in his leadership skills. Sick of being sidelined and marginalized in the war the men of the 332nd finally get the equipment and the approval they need to prove themselves in the air primarily as protection for bombers delivering their payloads. But ""Red Tails"" runs into serious storytelling snags particularly in its episodic second half. The writing is self-conscious in the extreme whether spoken by Germans (""My God"" says the nemesis whom the Red Tails nickname ""Pretty Boy"" -- ""those pilots are African"") or a white American prisoner of war (""I guess theres a lot more to you coloreds than we thought"") or a fellow pilot of the 332nd Fighter Group (""Congratulations Captain -- you are the first Negro to shoot down a Jerry"")."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""110""gt;The actors do all they can.

Share Tweet About halfway through Red Tails coughs up a memorable scene amid a lot of dull drama played out by unmemorable characters and not-so-impressive CGI dogfights. A group of the films heroes the African-American World War II pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen head into the Italian town near their base to engage in some well-earned Ramp;R. On their way to a local dance hall theyre stopped by a group of white soldiers who invite them into the officers club from which one of them was rejected earlier in the film. A lot of wary glances follow the invitation. The black pilots know theyve earned the right to be there--more than earned it--but they cant fully convince themselves that their white brothers-in-arms have decided to treat them as equals. Theyre all risking their necks for the same country but the Tuskegee Airmen have spent their lives understanding that some are born able to enjoy its benefits more easily than others thanks to the color of their skin. Like so much of the film the scene resolves predictably. But for a couple of moments it feels as if Red Tails might turn into the film the Tuskegee Airmen deserve one that pays tribute to their heroism while depicting the complex circumstances that made that heroism all the more remarkable. Instead its the sort of bland by-the-numbers tribute destined to bore high-school history students with lazy teachers for years to come a sort of Remember The Titans with P-51s and Nazis instead of footballs and racist school-board members. Directed by Anthony Hemingway (a television and second-unit vet) from a script by John Ridley and Boondocks creator Aaron McGruder Red Tails focuses on the experiences of a handful of young pilots headed by David Oyelowo (the hotheaded hero) and Nate Parker (the leader... with a secret) as they struggle to prove themselves to the Army that only reluctantly wants them in the air. Terrence Howard and a pipe-chomping Cuba Gooding Jr. co-star as a pair of commanding officers who dont figure much in the action a couple of talented Wire veterans (Andre Royo and Michael B. Jordan) hang around without getting much to do and Bryan Cranston shows up to be racist before disappearing. George Lucas produced Red Tails a project hes been working on in one form or another since the late 1980s. Two-plus decades ought to have been time enough for someone to give the film some vision but Ridley and McGruder fill their surprisingly flavorless script with predictable developments characters who would be interchangeable but for a single defining trait and dialogue that sounds a few drafts away from being done. (Oyelowo after a courageous run against some Nazis ""How do you like that Mr. Hitler?"") The aerial sequences look an awful lot like X-wing-versus-TIE-fighter battles (which were inspired by the World War II films of Lucas youth but that doesnt make the resemblance any less distracting) and the effects have the same not-quite-solid feel of the Star Wars prequels. When the heroes crash they go up in blazes of digital glory that seem just as artificial as the plotting that brought them to their fates.

Daily Edition Login to download Red Tails Film Review 753 PM PST 1/18/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Lucas Films Action-and-effects version of the Tuskegee airmens story flies only when its off the ground. TWITTER The George Lucas-produced labor of love stars Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard as Tuskegee airmen in World War II. The experience of black American aviators in World War II gets a whitewash in Red Tails. The story of the 996 pilots (and some 15000 ground personnel) who distinguished themselves in the air in the face of institutional racism is a great one and at least will come to the attention of more people due to this long-gestating project from Lucasfilm. But every character here is so squeaky-clean and the prejudice as depicted is so toothless and easily overcome that the film feels like a gingerly fantasy version of what in real life was an exceptional example of resilient trail-blazing. The tales considerable built-in inspirational value will move and impress black audiences of all ages and would do the same to a wider public if sufficiently promoted but the determinedly simplistic approach will curtail interest among any viewers hungry for some real history. The anticipated low interest level for this material overseas is cited as a major reason the project took so long to get off the ground. A key signal of how much you can trust any contemporary movie about either of the 20th centurys world wars is how and even if it depicts smoking; if like this one it buckles to current fashion and scarcely depicts soldiers smoking at all in a period when cigarettes were part of ration kits then its frankly not to be trusted in any other respect either. Here Cuba Gooding Jr.s major sucks thoughtfully on a pipe and one hotshot pilot sports a stogie in one scene but otherwise the environs are as smoke-free as the Brigham Young University campus. PHOTOS The Making of Steven Spielbergs War Horse Showing its action-slanted hand at the outset two pilots in P-40 fighters ""Easy"" (everyone has a nickname like that) and ""Lightning"" make quick work of a German munitions train in Italy. Right away the film plays fast and loose with period by enabling their buddies back at the base to watch footage of the explosive strike as if every plane were equipped with a camera that could provide nightly ESPN-style highlights. Talk about kowtowing to a younger generation that supposedly requires instantaneous and repeated gratification. ""Easy"" (Nate Parker) is the flight leader whose secret vice is the bottle while ""Lightning"" (David Oyelowo) is his fearless wingman who also has the brass to court a warm signorina (Daniela Ruah) from the nearby picture-postcard village. At this stage of the conflict in the summer of 1944 the all-Negro 99th Fighter Squadron remains far from the center of action restricted to ""mopping floors"" in the battle against fascism while the men are ready and eager for real missions. The problem lies specifically at the just-built Pentagon and of course with society at large neither of which is ready to accept blacks on an equal footing with whites. The military as with so much else is strictly segregated and a line or two of dialogue make the point that the common assumption is that blacks simply arent up to the demanding job of combat aviation. Throughout the film however all opposition to the universally sympathetic protagonists falls like so many bowling pins. The first time one of the fliers ventures into the whites-only officers club in Italy he slugs a guy who calls him the n-word and remarkably isnt court-martialed; the next time a bunch of the squadron members are invited in with drinks all around. Later when bomber crews notice their new escorts are ""colored"" they express startled dismay but after one successful run one young flier exclaims ""I hope we meet up with those Red Tails next time"" No relentless and unrepentant redneck characters played by James Woods in this film. And when a Nazi fighter pilot disdains his ""African"" opponent you know hell be biting the dust in short order. VIDEO George Lucas Red Tails Trailer Debuts And so it goes in a a script that doesnt begin to show what these young men were really up against and how patient and stoic they had to be in the face of so much resistance. Screenwriters John Ridley and Aaron McGruder neglect or perhaps assume too much common knowledge of the key component of struggle at the heart of all social drama. There are no difficulties at all in the romantic subplot as Lightnings inamorata is smiley and sweetly compliant at all times; the squadrons Washington-based representative (Terrence Howard) negotiates pretty successfully on its behalf against dubious superiors and the men themselves are all strictly one-dimensional without the sorts of characterizing details or personal demons that were commonly found among the men who populated even routine WWII films at the time. Beyond that theres far too little sense of sacrifice of something profoundly meaningful earned at significant cost. But perhaps George Lucas who reportedly developed this project for 23 years always saw this as an uncomplicated and uncomplex action film and in this regard at least the results are pretty good. Just a few years ago the technology would not have produced the sort of vivid and realistic renditions of airborne warfare that visual effects supervisor Craig Hammock has commandeered here. The planes (most impressively the glistening silver B-17 bombers) the firepower the crashes and all the pyrotechnics look pretty darn real; were past the time when as in ""The Battle of Britain"" or ""The Memphis Belle"" all the worlds air-worthy vintage warplanes had to be collected and sent aloft one more time for the purposes of restaging dogfights and bombing raids. The hits made by the Red Tails so named for the paint jobs applied to the rear ends of the hot new P-51s seem too easily achieved at times but the aerial footage is pretty cool throughout. The most explosive sequence is a raid on a German airbase that goes down as one of the squadrons most notable successes. STORY Star Wars Creator George Lucas Fires Back at Fanboys Red Tails Snub Gooding who appeared in The Tuskegee Airmen the 1995 TV film on the same subject postures through his role here as a major required to keep his men inspired and focused while Howard can never relax from his parts uniform-bound official functions. Like his character Oyelowo has by far the best time here as a flier whose recklessness is surpassed only by his cockiness. The rest make momentary impressions but should have been supplied by the writers and debuting director Anthony Hemingway (whose TV credits include The Wire and Treme) with more personalizing traits backstories and idiosyncracies. In the end its the flashy action and innate inspirational elements that make a measure of impact here. But you just know theres so much more to this story.

"Review The laudable Red Tails misses its target - Boston.com Just Like Heaven | The Cure Listen Live Boston.com HomeTodays GlobeNewsYour TownBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal Estate Movies Restaurants Music Theater/Art Television Celebrity news Events Games Comics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Review The laudable Red Tails misses its target By Jake Coyle AP Entertainment Writer / January 18 2012 E-mail| Print| Text size - + E-mail E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. In ""Red Tails"" the famed Tuskegee Airmen get the John Wayne-style heroic rendering they very much deserve but in a hackneyed and weirdly context-less story that does them a disservice.Long a pet project of his George Lucas self-financed the film and has said he hopes ""Red Tails"" will prove theres an audience for all-black movies. Thats a laudable goal but ""Red Tails"" reduces a historical story of deep cultural significance to merely a flyboy flick.Instead of creating something authentic and new ""Red Tails"" superimposes the tale of the black World War II pilots on a dated white genre of 1940s patriotic propaganda. ""Red Tails"" is blatantly old-fashioned just with a change in color.In medias res hardly says it ""Red Tails"" opens in the midst of an aerial dog fight while the credits are still rolling. Director Anthony Hemingway plunges right into the action skipping all that pesky backstory of black men braving the segregation of Jim Crowe America and against the odds rising up at the Tuskegee Institute.That history was stressed in an earlier 1995 HBO film ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" which benefited from Laurence Fishburnes sturdy presence. A co-star from that movie Cuba Gooding Jr. is here too as the pipe-chomping Maj. Emanuelle Stance. The other higher-up with him is Col. A.J. Bullard played with unnatural speech by Terrence Howard whose smooth voice fails to find the register of a commander.The film is centered though on the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group which earned the nickname of Red Tails from the painted ends of their P-47 fighters. These first black military aviators in the U.S. armed forces flew more than 150000 sorties over Europe and North Africa during WWII often escorting Allied bombers. Sixty-six were killed in action.Their bravery helped persuade President Harry S. Truman to desegregate the military in 1948. Some 300 of them are still alive and most by invitation attended President Barack Obamas inauguration.Our group of thinly sketched pilots all come with cliche nicknames Joe ""Lightning"" Little (David Oyelowo) Marty ""Easy"" Julian (Nate Parker) Ray ""Junior"" Gannon (Tristan Wilds) Andrew ""Smoky"" Salem (Ne-Yo) Maurice ""Bumps"" Wilson (Michael B. Jordan) and Samuel ""Joker"" George (Elijah Kelly).The brash talented Lightning (who at one point is actually referred to as ""the best damned pilot weve got"") and the alcoholic captain Easy are at the films core which is buoyed by a warm feeling of camaraderie among the pilots. Lightning also pursues and finds romance with a local beauty (Daniela Ruah) near their Italian base.Hemingway is a TV veteran best known for his work with David Simon on ""The Wire"" and ""Treme."" One of the pleasures of ""Red Tails"" is seeing familiar ""Wire"" actors on the big screen including Wilds Jordan and Andre Royo who plays a mechanic. Surely theater etiquette allows for the exception of shouting out ""Bubbles"" at the first glimpse of Royo.The biggest flaw here is the corny script by John Ridley and Aaron McGruder the Boondocks cartoonist. Theres a fine swaggering vibe but a curious hesitance to really tell the Tuskegee story. Half of their two-front war (at home and in battle) goes largely without depiction except for one or two minor scrapes with racist officers. Neither is any hint given to the less than rapturous welcoming the men would get on their return home.The whole thing is unrealistically sunny both literally and metaphorically. The skies are always bright blue (better for highlighting the digital trickery) and hardly anyone dies. Though this is film about one of the most violent clashes in history little seems at risk. The racist generals (Bryan Cranston makes a cameo as one) are back in Washington and the free Italian base is a happy world away from the segregated U.S. The German fighters are cartoonishly evil.But ever since ""Star Wars"" Lucas and his Industrial Light and Magic effects house have always specialized in aerial combat -- and ""Red Tails"" is no exception. The dogfights are elegant and clearly staged set against a majestic European landscape.""Red Tails"" might smother the Tuskegee Airmen in the tropes of old Hollywood but theres still inspiration to be found in seeing those tropes acted out with goodwill and fresh faces.""Red Tails"" a 20 Century Fox release is rated PG-13 for some sequences of war violence.

B- Red Tails Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Terrence Howard Nate Parker; Director Anthony Hemingway; Release Date Wide 01/20/2012; Runtime (in minutes) 120; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Posted January 24 2012 -- 1200 AM EST Its been 26 years since Top Gun but the dogfights in that absurdly entertaining Reagan-era classic have lost none of their speed-demon zap. That said Top Gun lets you know that youre basically watching a videogame with actors. Not so with Red Tails a lavishly square historical drama about the Tuskegee Airmen the very first African-American military pilots who served in segregated units during World War II. The movie has potent sequences of aerial combat that recall Tom Cruise and his flyboys bombarding evil out of the air. Here though the planes zoom close to the ground with the tree-lined hills of Italy looming up behind them. The actors really appear to be flying and that gives the Airmens brushes with the enemy -- even when theyre just providing ""escort"" cover for white pilots -- a heart-in-the-throat you-are-there quality. Plus they do get to bomb a few Nazi planes. As long as it stays in the air Red Tails a George Lucas production written by John Ridley (U Turn) and directed by Anthony Hemingway (a veteran of The Wire and CSI NY) is a compelling sky-war pageant of a movie. On the ground its a far shakier experience dutiful and prosaic with thinly scripted episodes that dont add up to a satisfying story. The scenes of racial conflict like one set at a white officers club are vivid illustrations of what the Airmen were up against and Terrence Howard as the colonel who argues for the right of the 99th Fighter Squadron to see combat is defiant in an enjoyably savvy high-command way. David Oyelowo in the Cruise-ian role of Joe ""Lightning"" Little -- the daredevil who must learn to fly in support of his team -- makes cocky bravado desperate and human. But just about everyone else in the cast achieves one or two eager dimensions rather than three.
