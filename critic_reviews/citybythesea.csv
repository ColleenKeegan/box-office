The son of a murderer dedicates his life to fighting crime as a cop then finds his own son accused of murder. The premise which is based on a true story is compelling enough and the film has its emotionally affecting moments. Mostly however City is a standard-issue potboiler bolstered by powerful performances from stars Robert De Niro Frances McDormand and James Franco (still bearing James Deans hooded glance). De Niro who has gone the comedic route lately with Showtime Meet the Parents and Analyze This (and the upcoming sequels for the latter two) returns to his origins as an Italian-American tough guy. Raw and compelling De Niro plays NYPD homicide detective Vincent LaMarca whose devotion to his work and ferocious temper destroyed his marriage and led to estrangement from his troubled drug-addicted son Joey (Franco). Vincent lives a solitary existence occasionally interrupted by lovemaking sessions with his neighbor Michelle (McDormand) who accepts Vincents emotional isolation but demands honesty. She plays the metaphorical conscience of the movie and in her principled ways Michelle opens Vincents eyes to his self-absorption and the problems it has wrought. McDormand has a salt-of-the-earth quality that lends itself nicely to this role. But about two-thirds of the way through the movie she inexplicably disappears from the proceedings. Its understood that the few women in this movie tend to be relegated to long-suffering roles but the arc of her character is left oddly dangling. Joey gets involved with seedy characters who set him up as a cop killer. Vincent must decide whether he finally will be there to help his son as he had not been during the boys youth. City set around the crumbling boardwalk and ramshackle streets of Long Beach Long Island has a moody atmosphere aided by its gritty look. Its a run-of-the-mill cop thriller but also a gripping family drama. It is in the moments spent untangling the threads of troubled relationships that the movie is at its best.

Caruso SMPSP (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Like father unlike son / De Niro is riveting as a cop who tracks a killer only to find its his boy 1 / 2 Back to Gallery CITY BY THE SEA Drama. Starring Robert De Niro Frances McDormand and James Franco. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Another tired cop in another dirty town. By now Robert De Niro could play that role in his sleep but he doesnt in ""City by the Sea."" Its a police drama thats lifted out of the routine by the demands it places on De Niro as an actor and by the way he responds -- full-out uncovered emotionally naked. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones who guided De Niro to a strong performance in ""This Boys Life"" the picture is about a New York detective Vincent LaMarca whose distinguished police career has been spent under a psychological cloud. His father was a murderer executed in the electric chair. Vincents professional life has been a kind of lifelong atonement or at least a denial of a family stigma. But thats all turned upside down when his son kills a drug dealer in a knife fight. Based on a 1997 Esquire article ""City by the Sea"" takes its inspiration from true events. There really is a Vincent LaMarca a man who found himself at the center of a generational murder sandwich after an exemplary career in the New York Police Department. But everything else in the movie is dramatic embellishment. In real life LaMarca was married and retired when his son committed the murder. Here hes divorced and fairly miserable a working detective unwittingly investigating the murder his son committed. These dramatic flourishes change the nature of the story so much that its surprising the character names werent changed as well. But these changes work to support a consistent vision from the lighting to the performances. ""City by the Sea"" is a dark movie about battles lost about the inexorable movement from light to darkness from ripeness to decay from joy to disillusionment. CONSISTENTLY BLEAK Indeed its so bleak that it would play like a contrived neo-noir if it werent so consistent committed and obviously sincere. Vincent has watched his personal life slide into ruin just as hes seen the home of his childhood Long Beach Long Island go from a beach resort -- captured on countless Kodachrome home movies -- to a monochromatic wasteland of wrecked boardwalks and hypodermics in the sand. This is what happens in 40 years time. How does it happen? Who knows? Maybe entropy maybe neglect maybe not enough people caring -- or maybe nothing could have made a difference. Like its hero ""City by the Sea"" occupies an emotional zone between resignation and despair which is a lot like regular resignation only less relaxing. A body washes up in New York and in the background loom the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The sight reinforces the sense of hopelessness. No wonder that LaMarca finds comfort in stasis. He has a cozy go-nowhere sexual relationship with his downstairs neighbor (Frances McDormand). He has a job he wont quit even though hes eligible for retirement. Hes a man of routine. Routines are good; progress is bad. Progress is your son going from a smiling toddler to a crack addict. As Joey Vincents son James Franco provides the movies other powerhouse performance. His lying his addiction his anger -- its all ugly. Even the way he moves his body is ugly. Theres no pleading by Franco for audience understanding. He seems irredeemable. Too bad then that the movie softens up his crime (which takes place in the first minutes) transforming into a case of self-defense what had been in real life something more cold-blooded. ""City by the Sea"" is a movie about fathers and sons. It doesnt whitewash Vincent and neither does it make him responsible. Rather it presents him in ways that allow us to see his blind spots his inner dead zones. Its as if half of his emotional nature has a curtain drawn over it and his choice -- to live his life that way -- has had consequences. We see that realization growing in the eyes of his neighbor ably played by McDormand. BREATHLESS AUDIENCE Its in the nature of such bottled-up characters that eventually the dam breaks. In some movies that can be contrived but in ""City by the Sea"" when De Niro opens up -- trying with everything he has to stop the destruction -- no one in the audience breathes. This is real. De Niro has been showing us great stuff for 30 years now but in this movie he shows us something new. . This film contains violence strong language and sexual situations.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Thats one of the central questions of ""City by the Sea"" and in a truly magnificent performance Robert De Niro sets out to answer it. De Niro plays New York City Detective Vincent LaMarca whose father was executed for murder when Vincent was only eight years old. Young Vincent is then mentored by the same New York detective who arrested his father and eventually Vincent follows him into the police department. But the shadow of his fathers crime never completely leaves LaMarca. Later he marries Maggie (Patti LuPone) and settles down in Long Beach Long Island but their union ends in a burst of marital violence. Vincent can see his son Joey (James Franco TNTs ""James Dean"") only during court-ordered supervised visits. Racked by guilt he eventually deserts his son just as he himself was deserted and starts a new life in Manhattan. Fourteen years later hes settled into a quiet routine with few attachments other than a casual affair with his neighbor Michelle (played by Frances McDormand). LaMarca and his partner Reginald Duffy (played by George Dzundza best known for his role as Detective Max Greevey during the first year of the TV series ""Law amp; Order"") are investigating the murder of a drug dealer whose body has washed up on a rocky Brooklyn beach. The investigation leads them to Long Beach and the broken world that Vincent thought he had left behind. Gradually a suspect emerges some low-life junkie named Joey. Its just a routine case -- until Joeys last name is revealed to be LaMarca. Vincent is taken off the case due to a conflict of interest and Reggie promises him that hell bring Joey back in safe and sound.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr B City by the Sea Genre Mystery and Thriller Drama; Starring Robert De Niro James Franco Drena De Niro Eliza Dushku William Forsythe Stephi Lineburg Patti LuPone Frances McDormand Anson Mount; Director Michael Caton-Jones; Author Ken Hixon; Release Date Wide 09/06/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 108; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 4 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT City by the Sea is like something you happen to stumble across on late-night television and its earnest and square and a little nondescript but your thumb never quite hits the zap button and slowly almost in spite of yourself you realize that youve been drawn in hooked by the urgency of a heartfelt mediocre movie. Or maybe its just the performers that get you. I felt myself lured into ""City by the Sea"" the moment that James Franco with scuzzy clothes a lopsided scowl and an electric shock of hair that makes him look like the Bob Dylan of 1965 crossed with a gangly desiccated Johnny Depp came into view on a dilapidated Long Island boardwalk trying to hawk a beat-up guitar for 20 so that he could score some dope. There have been a million sideshow junkies in the movies but Franco who starred in TNTs ""James Dean"" and gave what is perhaps the single greatest performance I have ever seen in a TV biopic (miraculously he was able to match Deans intensity) speaks here with the soft barely articulate wail of a wounded young boy and he turns his face into a road map of desolation. Hes never less than transfixing. In ""City by the Sea"" Francos ravagement is matched by the decay of his surroundings - the oceanside town of Long Beach N.Y. which is portrayed in the movie as a bombed-out wasteland of a suburban resort full of grimy coffee shops and porn parlors thugs and losers and windowless abandoned warehouses and apartment buildings under lowering gray skies. You might call it squalid except that theres hardly enough life on hand to fuel more than a token neon glimmer of decadence. The director Michael Caton-Jones (""This Boys Life"") shoots this empty shell of a landscape in what might be described as 70s-new-realism style employing telephoto long shots that invite us to view the characters as visual aspects of their environment. As Francos wormy man-child lurches his way across the screen stabbing a drug dealer dead in a disastrous act of self-defense you have very little idea of who this weirdly innocent killer is but you know that you want to keep watching him. You also want to watch Robert De Niro. He has played more than his share of anonymously weary middle-aged urban cops but if De Niro walked through his roles in ""15 Minutes"" and ""Showtime"" in ""City by the Sea"" its the character whos desperate and beleaguered not the performance. De Niros Vincent LaMarca has a blobbyish physique and a very square haircut thats a little too long mostly because it looks like Vincent is too lazy to keep it trim. He lives in a ratty fourth-floor walk-up and more nights than not he moseys downstairs to canoodle with his neighbor Michelle (Frances McDormand) whos sort of his girlfriend except that he keeps her - along with the rest of the world - at arms length. There are you see Scandalous Incidents in Vincents past; he would just as soon not talk to anyone about them. The principal one involves Francos Joey who is now officially wanted for murder. Joey is a trashed human being but he happens to be Vincents son abandoned years before by a father who didnt believe in himself. A cop who rediscovers his estranged child on the wrong side of the law - it sounds like the most movieish of situations. But ""City by the Sea"" is in fact based on actual events (it was adapted from a 1997 Mike McAlary Esquire article) and the best thing about the film is that it refuses to either hype or shun its ironies. As De Niro and Franco circle toward each other full of sadness and bile they pick open their old wounds and the movie turns into a policier version of an Arthur Miller father-son truthfest which is at once corny a little schematic and just honest enough to work. De Niro plays Vincent with an insecurity a deep-down squirmy shame that were not used to seeing from this actor in dramatic roles. Its one of his gentlest most quietly affecting performances. ""City by the Sea"" has combustible moments that wake you right up like the ones featuring William Forsythe as a pirate-haired drug dealer who coasts on self-satisfied macho and it has elements that tilt toward the maudlin. (Integral as it is I could have lived without the baby.) It also has the kind of what-the-hell poetic title and indifferent marketing campaign that inevitably accompanies movies that open during the week that kids go back to school. I wonder however whether the films commercial prospects arent doomed by its best qualities as well. ""City by the Sea"" moves along with a quietude a scruffy direct plainness that has long gone out of style. At least it has on the big screen.

Ken Hixon liberally adapts the true story of the tragic LeMarca family often softening actual events to observe how a good cop deals with a drug-addicted son. This review was updated on Aug. 30 2002. Somber straightforward ""City by the Sea"" revives ghosts from the 1950s both those of its central character and of an era obsessed on stage and screen with kitchen-sink realism. Ken Hixon liberally adapts the true story of the tragic LeMarca family -- first reported by Esquire magazine scribe Mike McAlary -- often softening actual events to observe how a good cop deals with a drug-addicted son who has committed murder. Robert De Niros reunion with helmer Michael Caton-Jones doesnt stoke the same fire as their previous pere-fils drama ""This Boys Life"" partly because De Niros latest portrayal of a troubled cop feels so familiar. B.O. reception will be respectable but muted with De Niro fans carrying pic along in this years thin early September period. McAlarys account connects young Joey LaMarcas vicious murder of a low-life in the run-down resort of Long Beach outside of New York City to the notorious homicide of a baby 40 years earlier by LaMarcas grandfather Angelo in playing out its atavistic theme of the psychological pressures on fathers and sons. Respected cop Vincent LaMarca (De Niro) -- father of Joey son of Angelo -insists both men were responsible for their actions and not victims of a theoretical ""murder gene."" ""City"" could easily have been a large-canvassed movie examining the three generations of men in equal measure but Caton-Jones compresses the story focusing only on Vincent and his reactions to Joeys (James Franco) downfall. The stage is set in Long Beach as Joey hocks his guitar for cash to buy heroin from connection Snake (Brian Tarantina). Dazed and high Joey suddenly finds himself tussling and half-unconsciously stabbing a dealer attacking Snake. (This is a divergence from the real-life murder perpetrated by Joey which was premeditated ruthless and grotesque.) Meanwhile in Gotham Vincent is living in a walk-up apartment just a floor below g.f. Michelle (Frances McDormand) who he has been dating for a year and who knows nothing of his troubled past. Plot begins to operate on parallel tracks as Vincents partner Reg (George Dzundza) examines the dumped body of the murdered dealer and the investigation leads back to Vincents former haunts in Long Beach while the dealers partner Spyder (William Forsythe in his latest scumbag role) puts the heat first on Snake to fess up about the killing and then on Joeys estranged g.f. Gina (Eliza Dushku) for Joeys whereabouts. At the 30-minute mark Vincent learns that the suspect in the murder is Joey with whom hes been out of touch for 14 years since Vincent walked out on wife Maggie (Patti Lupone). Having concealed his darker heritage Vincent must now tell the truth to Michelle -- both about Joey and about his own father. Caton-Jones shrewdly stages this confession over dinner and the scene is delivered so precisely that the viewers response is the same as Michelles. The existence of Joey and Ginas little son Angelo suggests Vincent eventually might have a chance at redemption. De Niro infuses his familiar NYC cop identity with a feeling of near-exhaustion and emotional fatigue the outward face of a man who has been privately suffering for years. Franco meanwhile plays every moment like hes hopelessly trapped which tends to rob Joey of the context his character needs in order to achieve the balance of sympathies between father and son called for in Hixons dramatic revisions of the McAlary article. An extended 15-minute action sequence that finally leads to Joeys arrest alternates between the intriguing and the routine. McDormand adds more to Michelle than is on the page. In the end however her character is still little more than a lover who wants to better understand her man. Dushku and Lupone have smaller but much rangier roles and each effectively pulls out the stops when the moment calls for it. A gray mood permeates this color film especially in the gutted beachside resort area (Bruce Springsteens sad hometown of Asbury Park N.J. substitutes for Long Beach) which Karl Walter Lindenlaubs camera frames like a giant arena of the lost and abandoned. Violence in this R-rated project is considerably toned down from its source material. The soundtrack uneasily mixes the interesting counterpoint of Chopin and a cheery dance-era theme with John Murphys literal-minded scoring.
