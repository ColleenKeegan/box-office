"Clever `Wicker Man remake is both creepy and comical - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Clever Wicker Man remake is both creepy and comical By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 2 2006 ``The Wicker Man"" Neil LaButes bonkers remake of the 1973 horror flick stars a lean mean Nicolas Cage as Edward Malus  a California highway cop who gets a beseeching letter from an old flame. She wants him to come to the private enclave where she lives near Puget Sound -- its called Summersisle -- and find her missing daughter. He goes and discovers immediately thats hes wandered into a gynocentric nightmare. The Wicker Man is a great big tower where the women present sacrifices as part of a harvest ritual. And Malus thinks the missing girl could be this years offering. Not exactly.None of the islands male residents can speak; they just haul. And the women are either burly surly matrons or younger milkier maids. Both varieties look like theyre waiting for Beowulf to return home. And most of them are named for plants flowers and sweet things Dr. Moss (Frances Conroy) Sister Honey (Leelee Sobieski) Sister Rose the schoolteacher and her twin Sister Thorn both played insinuatingly by Molly Parker.Officer Malus cuts through the medieval propriety and estrogen force fields with comic impudence Wheres the girl? No one seems to know though everyone smirks. Even the pig tailed lasses in the schoolhouse Malus barges in on play dumb. To be fair Sister Rose was in the middle of her lesson on signs. ``Will you tell us what man represents in his purest form"" she asks the class. ``Phallic symbol Phallic symbol"" the girls exclaim. Malus rolls his eyes.Halfway through the film Ellen Burstyn turns up as the hallowed Sister Summersisle a sage of fierce Celtic stock and amazing hair and skin. (Whats her secret?) ``Im the spiritual heart of this colony"" she intones taking the movies apiary images and metaphors to the hilt. ( Malus naturally is allergic to bees.)The women are intimidating in this picture (as they are in any LaBute production) but as the punishing finale and amusing epilogue demonstrate theyre also flagrantly evil. Its hard not to laugh at LaButes jokey misogyny however. The film almost a satire of movies that hate women suggests Margaret Atwoods novel ``A Handmaids Tale"" reimagined as ``The Beguiled"" that old Clint Eastwood vehicle.As it is LaBute has cleverly repurposed his creepy source material. This ``Wicker Man"" which wasnt screened for critics is a nutty atonement for the gender assaults of his filmmaking and playwriting past including ``In the Company of Men"" ``Your Friends amp; Neighbors"" and ``The Shape of Things."" Of course hes saying sorry with two fingers crossed behind his back. And the deception is a guilty pleasure.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

So instead of Christopher Lees eccentric aristocrat lording it over his phallus-worshipping Scottish serfs we have Ellen Burstyn queening it over her commune of feminist worker bees and Edward Woodwards strait-laced God-fearing policeman is replaced by Nicolas Cage s haunted belligerent motorcycle cop. Lured to a remote island by an old flame whose daughter has gone missing Cage tries to shout bully and punch his way to the truth. But his blinkered violence is no match for the feminists fancy footwork and his bad-tempered bear soon falls into their honey-trap. Substituting irrelevant back-story for insidious intrigue and daft stunts for suspense LaButes film drones on and on. Finally and most unforgivably its cursory Wicker Man finale fails to replicate the fiery shock of the original.

It is one of many remakes that audiences have been forced to suffer through in recent years. It lacks all of the potent imagery of the original with its clash between Sergeant Howies virgin like ravings and the earthy pleasures of the community that he is investigating. The original had its own flaws many of which were created when the original cut was trimmed by a studio that was changing hands.

"Wicker Man The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wicker-man-the ) Wicker Man The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli When attempting what is often deemed the most unnecessary of cinematic projects the remake a filmmaker can adopt a nearly identical plot but still generate an inferior product. Such is the case with Neil LaBute and The Wicker Man. LaBute isnt a hack director. He chooses his projects carefully and has an impressive resume that lists a group of smart challenging pictures but nowhere has he gone more wrong than in his misguided attempt to modernize Anthony Shaffers 1973 screenplay. Despite retaining significant chunks of Shaffers dialogue to go along with the basic story structure LaBute has transformed the eerie disturbing psychological thriller into an unintentional comedy. At times The Wicker Man is hilariously bad. When this isnt the result of LaButes ill-advised ""enhancements"" to the original tale its caused by absurd new lines or Nicolas Cages bumbling attempts to step into Edward Woodwards shoes. One of the most significant changes is evident early in the proceedings. In the 1973 movie the central conflict was between Christianity and paganism. Religious convictions were the underlying motivator for all that transpired. In the 2006 version that aspect has been diluted. The ""pagans"" have now become a group of matriarchal feminists who have isolated themselves from the mainstream. They stand in opposition not to Christianity but to modern male-dominated society. Theres no reason this couldnt have worked had it been handled better. Edward Malus (Cage) is a California cop who is taking some time off following an on-the-job tragedy. At the request of an old girlfriend Willow (Kate Beahan) he travels to the mysterious island of Summersisle to investigate the disappearance of Willows daughter Rowan. He finds himself in a closed society where men are valued only for their ability to perform physical labor and aid in procreation and where a nature goddess is worshipped. The island is presided over by Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn) a woman whose word is law. Edward discovers disturbing clues about what may have happened to the little girl. They involve an annual May Day festival that incorporates human sacrifice. Rowan may still be alive but her time could be limited. Its April 30. Then Willow drops a bombshell Rowan is Edwards daughter. The good thing about The Wicker Man (to the extent that anything good can be mentioned) is that the shocking ending has been left intact. The bad thing is that almost every change occurring before that iconic moment is a misfire. The prologue is unnecessary and creates logistical problems when viewed in retrospect. Making Rowan Edwards daughter muddies the waters without adding significant emotional complexity. The most egregious error is a lengthy speech given by Sister Summersisle near the end that explains the plan in painstaking detail. The 1973 left a few things up to the audiences imagination; LaButes approach not only insults the intelligence but heightens the sense of contrivance. In the 1973 movie Edward Woodwards performance as the visiting policeman was peerless. Nicolas Cage is a woeful replacement. His delivery is stiff and the character comes across as absurd. Given the right role Cage can be effective but this is a case of miscasting. Similar comments can be made about Ellen Burstyn who has taken the part originally essayed by Christopher Lee. Lees Summerisle was dark and menacing. Burstyns gender-shifted interpretation is cartoonish. Another disappointment is that the change in focus and PG-13 rating disallow a recreation of one of the most striking sequences from the first movie Britt Ecklands nude seduction dance. The ominous atmosphere of the original has not been effectively re-created. Certainly the Summersisle where Edward lands is strange but its quirks are presented as more fatuous than dangerous. Theres no sense of claustrophobia no feeling of being trapped. And despite the shortness of time theres no urgency. Edwards investigation is uninteresting because all the details that made the 1973 version compelling (most of which had nothing to do with following the clues) have been stripped away. Much as I might like to stand up for Neil LaBute he has left himself in an indefensible position with The Wicker Man. Audiences who have not seen the 1973 version will be surprised by the ending but unimpressed by what leads up to it. Those familiar with the earlier movie will be horrified by the wrong turns taken in re-shaping it for 2006 consumption. As is always the case with an inferior remake give the new version a pass. Instead rent the original. Its in color. You get atmosphere and tension plus Christopher Lee Edward Woodward and a delightfully naked Britt Eckland. Why bother with LaButes miscalculation?

Starring Nicolas Cage Kate Beahan Ellen Burstyn Molly Parker and Francis Conroy. Directed by Neil LaBute. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Dont go into the woods is an admonition that should be heeded not just by prepubescent girls but also by actors. Nicolas Cages finest hours are not spent frantically running through a forest in ""The Wicker Man"" especially when he must do so dressed in a bear suit. The reason for his laughable getup has to do with a pagan ritual portentously known as the Day of Death and Rebirth. The movie itself is a kind of rebirth or remake as they say in the biz. The original 1973 version has become a cult classic. It is totally creepy while the new model while well intentioned is only occasionally so. Its hard to sustain a scary mood when suddenly something unintentionally funny happens such as Cages cell phone ringing in a desolate area where reception would be highly unlikely. Related Stories Into the wild with his heater He plays California Highway Patrolman Edward Malus. That hes a good cop is immediately established when he stops to pick up a doll dropped along the road and deliver it to its owner a blond youngster riding with her mom all their belongings tied to the top of a broken-down station wagon as if they were Okies. Unfortunately his good deed leads to their vehicle being slammed into and them going up in flames. Consumed with guilt at his inability to save them Edward takes an extended leave and sits mindlessly in front of his TV popping pills. Then a letter arrives from a former girlfriend (Kate Beahan) begging him to find her daughter who has gone missing on a private island in the Pacific Northwest. Packing heat his police badge and an audiotape of a self-help book called ""Everythings OK"" Edward rushes off to the rescue. The most substantial change writer-director Neil LaBute has made to the original is to switch the predominant gender on the island which is called Summersisle and is inhabited by modern-day pagans. Where men once ruled women are now in charge. Perhaps LaBute is trying to make amends for his first film ""In the Company of Men"" generally considered to be misogynistic. The women address one another as ""sister"" and dress in prim blouses and long skirts like Chloe Sevigny in ""Big Love."" Many of them are with child which immediately raises the question of where the community keeps its stallions. To his credit LaBute has put to work several fine actresses such as Molly Parker as the communitys schoolteacher Francis Conroy as its physician and Ellen Burstyn as the leader of the pack who goes by Sister Summersisle. The best scene is when Edward goes to her mansion to confront her about the fate of the missing girl. Burstyn establishes the No. 1 sisters power by never raising her voice above a whisper. Edward is at something of a disadvantage because hes getting over an attack by a swarm of bees. The islands main industry is making honey which allows for some creepy images of residents in beekeeper masks. LaBute has never been a particularly visual director. But he does a credible job of capturing Summersisle at various hours of the day using the oncoming darkness to establish a sense of foreboding. Also effective is the use of black and white for Edwards frequent flashbacks to the car accident that continues to haunt him. But LaButes usually keen ear for dialogue -- hes become quite a successful playwright -- often fails him. Cage has been given a number of ludicrous lines which he does his best to deliver with some believability. Trying to establish his authority Edward keeps boasting about how hes a police officer there on official business when hes far removed from his jurisdiction. His sarcasm talking to the ""sisters"" doesnt work. The gaping plot hole is why Edward would remain on the island without trying to enlist help when its so clear something very strange is going on. The surprise ending is pretty predictable even for those who havent seen the far superior first ""Wicker Man."" -- Advisory Disturbing and violent images.

In the case of Neil LaButes remake of ""The Wicker Man"" however its entirely possible that Warners indeed wanted to conceal a ludicrous misfire from auds as well. When a major studio release with two Oscar-winning stars opens without press previews one assumes the distrib is trying to hide the pic from critics. In the case of Neil LaButes remake of ""The Wicker Man"" however its entirely possible that Warners indeed wanted to conceal a ludicrous misfire from auds as well. Once derisive word of mouth starts to spread only connoisseurs of high camp and curious devotees of disasters will be queuing up at the box office. Yet another needless ""re-imagining"" of a 70s cult fave that truth to tell is better remembered than actually viewed LaButes folly follows the basic plot outline of the 1974 Brit horror opus of the same title. Original pic directed by Robin Hardy from a script by Anthony Shaffer featured Edward Woodward as a forthright but uptight cop who investigates the disappearance of a young girl in a remote island community where pagan rituals are a way of life. The cop finds himself repeatedly unsettled by the ubiquitous celebrations of sensuality encouraged by Lord Summerisle (an authoritatively flamboyant Christopher Lee) the communitys despotic leader. One celebration requires the ritual sacrifice of an innocent.In the Americanized remake the island community lies somewhere off the coast of Washington state. Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn) the serenely self-assured local leader is a high-priestess type who runs the place as matriarchal fiefdom with an absolute minimum of 21st century technology. Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) a California motorcycle cop journeys to the island after receiving a plaintive letter from one of its residents Sister Willow (Kate Beahan) a skittish sad-eyed beauty who just happens to be Edwards former fiancee. Willow claims her daughter has mysteriously disappeared. But just about everyone else in the community -- including a doctor (Frances Conroy) a hotel maid (Leelee Sobieski) and a teacher (Molly Parker) -- insist the girl never existed. And if she did shes dead. At first its modestly amusing to see how LaBute -- the writer-director of such notoriously nasty battles of the sexes as ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""In the Company of Men"" -- develops the concept of a normally competent doggedly rational man (a cop no less) who is repeatedly frustrated and humiliated in a matriarchal society based on ancient religious rituals. But the novelty of this role reversal -- ""In the Company of Wiccans"" anyone? -- wears thin long before the pic plods to its predictable conclusion. And any provocative questions LaBute might have wanted to raise are totally obscured as the rising tide of absurdity gradually overwhelms the entire enterprise. After the jarring events of the opening scene -- Edward frantically tries and tragically fails to save a mother and daughter from a fiery auto mishap -- aud may be inclined at first to interpret the cops manic behavior as the result of post-traumatic stress. As ""Wicker Man"" unwinds however and Edwards vertiginous mood swings vacillate ever more wildly it becomes increasingly clear that Cage -- who is one of the pics producers -- is working in his OTT mode. There are times of course when that spectacle can be amusing. (Witness ""Vampires Kiss"" for example.) In this context however Cages over-emoting only makes a silly scenario seem more ridiculous. For the most part the supporting perfs are unremarkable. (A glaring exception Beahans fidgety turn as the weeping Willow is remarkable for all the wrong reasons.) Paul Sarossys lensing and Angelo Badalamentis music suggest at least a half-hearted attempt at recapturing look and feel of 70s genre pics.
