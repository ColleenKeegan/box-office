Comments Catwoman Effects designer turned director Pitofs take on the leather girl with a thing for bling is sleek and glossy but he should have fast-forwarded through her transformation from underdog to top cat and done more to develop her miscreant side--Halle Berrys masked avenger is practically a stand-in for Batman. The screenplays a hodgepodge of witchcraft ancient Egyptian lore pulp feminism and a dash of S-M; Sharon Stone as a villainous cosmetics maven knows how to play it tongue-in-cheek but Berry doesnt--plus shes saddled with a nonsmoldering love interest (Benjamin Bratt). Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast is the real superhero; his homage to noir thrillers compensates for the spotty CGI and rescues the movie from sex-kitten kitsch. PG-13 104 min.

Jason has fled there with Franka Potentes Marie his lively German companion from ""The Bourne Identity."" Ms. Potente who came to prominence as the heroine of ""Run Lola Run"" was a welcome presence in the previous Bourne film a surprise hit two years ago and shes welcome again even if her character soon runs out of options. But most of the running here is done by Mr. Damon -- hes on the goa from start to finish. This skillfully crafted sequel moves at warp speed keeping you in a state of reasonably contented if often confused attentiveness. Still the nonstop action reminded me of George Carlins alarmed response to the ticket agent who tells him hes on a nonstop flight. At some point you yearn for solid ground. New and NoteworthyRead Joe Morgensterns take on the best of the new DVD releases. Most of the action involves maximum-impact chases via car or foot Bourne being pursued by bad guys who want to kill him (hes the lethal amnesiac product of a supersecret CIA project gone wrong) or Bourne chasing after his adversaries before they can find him. The locations also include Berlin and Moscow. (Oliver Wood did the glossy jiggly cinematography.) The script by Tony Gilroy owes little to the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name though a lot to Hitchcocks penchant for innocent heroes who dont know theyve been set up. Mr. Damons kinetic hero reveals a quiet sensitivity on the rare occasions between chases when quiet is allowed. Joan Allen gives an elegant tightly focused performance as Pamela Landy a CIA agent trying desperately on the basis of wrong assumptions to hunt Bourne down. The film was directed by a British filmmaker Paul Greengrass. His previous feature was ""Bloody Sunday"" an astonishingly lifelike re-enactment on a modest budget of the day in January 1972 when British soldiers killed 13 unarmed civilians during a peace march in Northern Ireland. Mr. Greengrass and his new colleagues in Hollywood probably have a hit on their hands ""The Bourne Supremacy"" gives summer audiences almost everything they crave. Yet ""Bloody Sunday"" had a power that ""Supremacy"" lacks and not only because the one was a heartfelt polemic and the other an action adventure. Mr. Greengrasss transition offers an example and not a heartening one of what can happen when an artist comes to Hollywood. The two most remarkable things about ""Bloody Sunday"" were its hurtling immediacy and its clarity. Even though the action was staged Mr. Greengrass put us in the midst of it with techniques that made the film look like raw combat photography. And though the actual event had descended into chaos his meticulously researched dramatization allowed us to understand who did what to whom and why they did it. In other words he showed himself to be just the sort of director who might manage on a vastly larger scale a sprawling action-packed production like ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Indeed he is. Some of those chases are impressive -- the car stuff of course but also one pursuit on the streets of Berlin during which Bourne and his pursuers get caught up in the confusion of once again a peaceful demonstration. Whats more Mr. Greengrass is good with all of his actors whenever acting rather than chasing becomes possible. That means one brief human moment between Ms. Allens Pam Landy and Ward Abbott the senior agent played by Brian Cox; another encounter between Bourne and a junior agent played by Julia Stiles who was utterly wasted in the first film; and a fight sequence as dramatic as it is violent pitting Bourne against a shadowy character played by Marton Csokas. All too often though ""The Bourne Supremacy"" has the feeling of a runaway train. The movie hurtles all right but at such head-pounding ear-pounding velocity that some of it plays like parody. Was that Mr. Greengrasss choice or did the studio impose the punishing pace on him? Whatever the case and it could have been a combination of both the result is an absence of clarity -- whats going on at a given moment is anyones guess -- and an oppressive intensity thats far removed from the surprise and spontaneity of the directors best work. ""Supremacy"" certainly works on its own terms but those terms are limiting. Its an entertainment machine about a killing machine. Catwoman ""Catwoman"" qualifies as top-grade catnip for connoisseurs of trashy camp. But thats not to say that this batty extravaganza wont find an audience that it isnt watchable (at your peril) or that Halle Berry doesnt give her heedless all to the cause of feline femininity. She plays Patience Philips a graphics designer who for most of the first tedious hour tiptoes through her life as a timid wage slave -- Mousewoman really. Then something very silly happens -- I wont tell you what but Andrew Lloyd Weber neednt eat his heart out -- and Patience turns into a lip-glossing hip-tossing bike-riding whip-cracking dominatrix who is clad (sparsely) in black leather bra and slinky pants with a helmet that suggests something between medieval executioner and Mouseketeer. This nice-nasty temptress represents a radical break with Selina Kyle/Catwoman the DC Comics character played by among others Michelle Pfeiffer Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt. But the movie wants us to take Patience and her halter ego semi-seriously as before-and-after poster persons for womens lib ""Catwomen are not contained by the rules of society"" Patience is told by Ophelia Powers a reclusive cat lady played by Frances Conroy. For that matter ""Catwomans"" director a visual-effects specialist named Pitof is not contained by the rules of filmmaking. Scenes that make sense? Nonsense. Characters with inner lives? Utterly passe. Pitof sells his scenes as point-of-purchase displays featuring assorted emotions. And when all else fails he falls back on staging music videos -- my favorite was a bizarre basketball break dance in which Patience enchants a dishy police detective played by Benjamin Bratt who will later detect her Catwomanly escapades then mistakenly arrest her. Lest you think that ""Catwoman"" is all about leather let me dwell for a moment on the plot which concerns the despicable husband-and-wife directors of a cosmetics company and a beauty cream that rots the skin on womens faces. The husband is played by Lambert Wilson in a cheeky bid for the title of Worst Acting Job Of the Year while the wife is embodied by Sharon Stone. Shrewd lady that she is Ms. Stone protects herself from ridicule by striking ethereal poses that havent been seen on the silver screen since Falconetti played Joan of Arc.    DVD TIP Jane Fonda was a sexy kittenish teacher turned train robber in ""Cat Ballou"" (1965) a spoofy Western that Elliot Silverstein directed from a script by Walter Newman. Lee Marvin co-starred in an Oscar-winning dual role as Kid Shelleen a boozy gunslinger and Tim Strawn a villain with a leather nose.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In a New York Times article about the recent spate of movies adapted from Marvel comics Marvel executive Allen Lipson claimed that one key to the companys success is its policy of retaining approval of how its characters are used in film. Others might consider adopting that plan. Not that fanboy purism should always carry the day but it would have prevented this scene from Catwoman Sent to a watery grave meek graphic designer Halle Berry washes up on an island covered in cats. One of them of the breed commonly known as ""CGI"" climbs atop her chest and breathes into her mouth. Rather than getting a whiff of half-digested Cat Chow Berry is filled with the spirit of the Egyptian cat goddess Bast. Able to leap around with feline grace wear revealing leather outfits without shame and improvise cat-themed puns she is Catwoman even though she bears little resemblance to the Catwoman from the Batman universe. Its like naming a movie Spider-Man because its about a guy with eight legs who shoots silk out of his ass. Of course none of that would matter if the movie were any good but its not. Mononymical director Pitof cut his teeth on digital effects and music videos and he directs Catwoman as though he was targeting the attention span of actual cats. He cuts rapidly keeping the camera in constant motion lest viewers wander off in search of food or a quiet place to nap. Its the least exciting form of excitement imaginable and the story doesnt prove much of a distraction. After her transformation Berry sets out to stop her old employer (Sharon Stone) from releasing an addictive destructive beauty cream called ""Beau-line""--surely the most unfortunate product name this side of Go-GURT Portable Yogurt. Meanwhile when not prancing about Berry romances sensitive cop Benjamin Bratt and trades quips with horny hungry sidekick Alex Borstein. In or out of costume Berry never creates a convincing character but its tough to saddle her with too much of the blame; Pitof on the other hand seems to draw his inspiration from the Joel Schumacher entries in the Batman franchise. Relentlessly gaudy and in love with its PG-13 approximation of kink Catwoman is essentially an excuse to pose Berry in ever-skimpier outfits. Its all too pre-fab to register as sexy though and even the fight scenes look like fashion shoots complete with anonymous Ramp;B bump n grind musical accompaniment. The film could have turned out worse but only via the addition of a Tom Green cameo or an accident in which the actors caught on fire.

Doane Gregory (c)2004 Warner Brothers If the ""Spider-Man movies represent all that can be wondrous and inspiring in a comic book adaptation ""Catwoman is the absolute opposite. Its cinema for the attention span-challenged -- a soulless amalgamation of quick edits computer images and swooping nausea-inducing dolly shots. The dialogue (credited to four different people) is too awkward to be unintentionally funny and the urban setting is too muddled to be considered gritty. The most egregious sin of all For an action movie its mind-numbingly boring. Yes Halle Berry is a jaw-dropping sight to behold in her dominatrix get-up ... er ... Catwoman uniform. But that alone doesnt make a movie and since all the scenes in which she kicks butt and leaps about with feline agility are sped-up you dont get to ogle her for long anyway. Actually calling this a comic book adaptation isnt completely accurate since Berrys character Patience Phillips has nothing to do with the original Catwoman of the DC Comics series Selina Kyle whos previously been portrayed by Julie Newmar Eartha Kitt and Michelle Pfeiffer. Shes not a villain - shes not even a villain with a heart of gold. She just dresses like a bad girl and roams around at night displaying her frightening martial arts skills and ends up being mistaken as a criminal. Patience we are told is a meek and lonely graphic designer at a cosmetics company who toils under the tyrannical rule of George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his aging supermodel wife Laurel (Sharon Stone). She has a fantastically bohemian loft and a funky sense of style but no social life. But who are we kidding? She looks like Halle Berry the 2002 best-actress Oscar winner for ""Monsters Ball. The ""Spider-Man movies derive much of their heart from the fact that Tobey Maguire looks and acts like a regular guy - an underdog you can easily root for whos intimidated by the awesomeness of his newfound powers. Patience overhears a conversation in which a scientist divulges that theres something wrong with the companys new anti-aging skin cream - ""We cant let this go on the shelves he proclaims indignantly - and is killed by Laurels thugs. An Egyptian mau with creepy green eyes crawls up on her chest brings her back to life and in no time shes prancing along rooftops in a black leather push-up bra and matching low-slung pants causing chaos with the crack of her whip. There are a few small funny moments in which Patience is confused by her new catlike tendencies. She paws at the fish in an aquarium with wild eyes and pads her way delicately across the back of her couch. And Frances Conroy (""Six Feet Under) brings a much-needed touch of grace as the nutty cat lady who explains to Patience how she evolved from a mild-mannered artist into an adventurous midnight prowler. But such scenes are overwhelmed by the films pervasive clunkiness. Patiences blossoming romance with a police detective (Benjamin Bratt) is an im-plausible chemistry-free collection of bland dates and chaste kisses. Of course he has no idea that the sweet woman hes dating is wreaking havoc at night as the citys most sought-after (alleged) criminal. Doing the right thing and exposing her former company for its evil deeds requires protracted cat fights -- literally -- with Laurel. The director who goes by Pitof -- presumably to avoid being confused with ""Charlies Angels director McG -- tries to infuse these brawls with a forced sense of Sapphic tension. If Laurel and Catwoman started making out at the top of the Hedare beauty headquarters instead of trying to throw each other off it even that wouldnt make the movie any more interesting. ""Catwoman a Warner Bros. Pictures release is rated PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality. 91 minutes. Return to top Copyright(c) 2000 - 2016 Canarsie Courier Publications Inc.

Tall dark stranger in uniform yet to lap you up? Simply slink off to your local bondage-wear emporium and shuck your chains for a black-leather corset mask and bullwhip ensemble which will have you striding through the night like a hellcat stealing motorbikes and ripping 16 shades of shit out of anyone who might get your goat. Morning-after amnesia will alleviate any residual guilt such antics might spark in your pre-Nietzschean daytime self and the best thing is youll feel so lithe no jail bars can hold you. (You are of course already thin.) Hard to muster a coherent reading of this confused dogs dinner of a movie; harder still to suggest anyone try its such seething tripe. Certainly the film hashes together post-Ally McBeal filleted feminism with perfunctory pro-teenage blockbuster kicks to the point of seemingly addressing career women as gormless pubescents - but just as galling are the films aesthetic evils. In no particular order a hyperactive monkey on a sugar-rush appears to have got its mitts on the camera controls and cutting button; more monkeys with word-processors flirt just close enough with Cat People references to remind you of the poetry theyre lacking; and the special effects are as plastic as the techno-fuzz sound track. Halle Berry makes a game bum-proud supervixen (shes laughable doing ditzy/frumpy of course) until you remember Michelle Pfeiffers far classier package - but the story cramps Sharon Stones older-vamp act. Youre left with flashes of mis-spent promise the feline mysticism; the cosmetics-industry intrigue; the idea of electrocuting Lambert Wilsons unctious corporate cad.

Or rather they should--and Warner Brothers new Catwoman is a great argument for why. By Noah Berlatsky Catwoman  (Has redeeming facet) Directed by Pitof With Halle Berry Benjamin Bratt and Sharon Stone. Some of my earliest sexual fantasies involve Catwoman. Specifically they revolve around a Batman audio recording I listened to when I was eight or so. I cant remember where I was at the time and Im pretty sure I heard the tape only once. But I remember the plot clearly Catwoman had developed a kind of supercatnip that she used to control Bruce Waynes mind and force him to help her steal some jewels. The storys muted eroticism was seared into my preadolescent brain even though--or more likely because--I didnt know exactly what catnip was. From the context I assumed it involved needles a misunderstanding that took me at least ten years to clear up. The specifics of my relationship with Catwoman may be idiosyncratic but I doubt Im the only one whos had a fling with her in the 60-plus years since she was invented by Bob Kane. Shes a firmly established part of what comic book writer Alan Moore calls the ""fictional planet--the place we have with us ever since we started listening to stories."" Moore adds ""We spend a lot of time in these imaginary worlds and we get to know them better than the real locations we pass on the street every day."" This is why making a movie about Catwoman or Spider-Man or for that matter King Arthur is such good business the audience already knows and loves the people in the film. Critics forced to sit through uninspired sequel after uninspired sequel often moan about late capitalism or marketing machinery or Hollywoods general lack of daring. But the truth is that the public has always liked to hear about the same damn people doing the same damn things over and over and over. Today we call these stories pulp; they used to be called myths. The argument that superheroes people a universal Joseph-Campbell-approved ur-bildungsroman is frankly preposterous no matter how often its wheeled out by desperate comic book fans. Superman is not Zeus and the Elongated Man is not the holy lingam. But the way their stories are produced is similar. Myths had no single creator; they were the products of lots of poets and singers and ordinary folks telling each other stories about the gods and adding to them as they went along. Nobody owned them--they belonged to everyone. In the case of pulp of course we generally do know the actual originator; we can point to Edgar Rice Burroughs say as the guy who made up Tarzan. But the creation often looms so much larger than the creator that it eclipses him altogether. Today Tarzan is as much the creation of Johnny Weissmuller as of Burroughs--and perhaps even more a product of the people whoever they were who worked on the Saturday-morning cartoon. Superheroes may be our cultures most communal possessions for the paradoxical reason that these days comic books are relatively little read. For most people if a movie or television character originated in a comic he might as well have sprung full-formed out of nowhere. This gives superheroes a certain fluidity which again makes them similar to mythological figures. Just as Argus had anywhere from four to a hundred eyes so a single superhero may change radically from story to story depending on whos doing the telling. In the first Superman comics for example our hero could only jump not fly while in the Christopher Reeve movie he can make time run backward by reversing the direction of the earths rotation. And what about the graphic novel The Nail an alternate universe story where the infant child rocketed from Krypton is found not by the Kents but by an Amish family and so becomes a pacifist with tragic consequences for all? If a major figure like Superman is treated with such freedom a minor one like Catwoman--Batmans female nemesis--is lucky to remain recognizable from appearance to appearance. In fact as the excellent fan-produced Web site Feline Fatale (pw1.netcom.com/mwomack) amply documents most aspects of the Catwoman character have been in flux over the years. Her origin has varied widely at first she was an amnesiac stewardess then an abused housewife and now thanks to comic book author Frank Miller shes a hard-boiled former dominatrix who delivers one-liners like ""You know why I hate men? . . . Never met one."" Her powers too have come and gone sometimes she has a whip sometimes shes a master of martial arts sometimes she has cats trained to do her bidding sometimes shes got supercatnip. Even her costume has been reworked early on she wore a full furry cat head; later she changed to a more manageable eye mask and a purple knee-length dress with a green cape. Her best-known outfit the form-fitting catsuit didnt become de rigueur until Julie Newmar wore it on the Batman TV series. In Batman Returns Michelle Pfeiffer moved the franchise more firmly towards fetish gear with a notoriously uncomfortable latex getup. More recently the comic book Catwoman has been wearing goggles of all things. But though one has a lot of leeway when telling a Catwoman story at least certain elements of the character need to be constant. Thats the challenge of writing about pulp icons you have to come up with a way to make the story your own while making sure it remains everyone elses too. A current success is the WBs popular series Smallville which gives us Superman as a teenager before he got his costume and gained control of all his powers. The series works as melodrama but much of its resonance comes from the audiences familiarity with the world of Superman--heat vision Lex Luthor Lana Lang the planet Krypton. By referencing this shared body of knowledge the shows creators demonstrate respect both for their material and their audience. The same cant be said of the people behind the new Catwoman movie. Here the familiarity is that of advertising not of archetype. One-named director Pitofs visuals are relentlessly anonymously stylish--one sequence on a basketball court could be mistaken for an exceptionally long soft-drink commercial while another where cubicle workers speed up to show the passage of time looks like a spot for telecommunications software. The plot such as it is involves a toxic beauty cream but the films main focus is on Halle Berrys rear end. Obviously no one involved in this disaster cares anything at all about Catwoman. Even so some of the scripts changes are unfathomable. For instance in all her previous incarnations Catwomans alter ego was named Selina Kyle. Now some secret identities--Dick Grayson for instance or Oliver Queen--have aged poorly. But what on earth is wrong with Selina Kyle? In the new movie Catwomans alter ego is named Patience Phillips. If that sounds a bit like Peter Parker well Berrys Catwoman has a lot more in common with Spider-Man than with the villainess from Batman. Just as Parker gains the strength and speed of a spider Patiences mystical cat benefactor grants her ""fierce independence total confidence and inhuman reflexes."" With her super-self-esteem Patience becomes Oprah in a Mexican wrestling outfit telling off all those who need telling off and boldly owning her consumer preferences. As a bonus she gains many of the attributes of cats such as fear of water and in a scene reminiscent of Splash an unseemly appetite for raw fish. The film is mercifully discreet on the subject of litterboxes. The one aspect of the traditional Catwoman character that the movie does seem interested in retaining is her moral ambiguity. In the comics Catwoman began her costumed career as a burglar and though shes reformed at various times in various incarnations shes usually remained at least a little iniquitous. Patience Phillips does in fact have a first-rate motive for turning to crime shes just lost her job. But when Catwoman does rather dutifully steal some jewels its only because you know cats like bright shiny things. And Patience almost instantly returns most of the loot in a bag marked ""Sorry."" Berrys Catwoman isnt selfish or greedy or even especially angry--she just has poor impulse control. This completely inverts the whole raison detre of the character. The old Catwoman was sexy because she was dangerous skillful and unattainable; Batman was attracted to her at least in part because she was a worthy foe. Here shes supposed to be appealing because shes animalistic--sexually aggressive spontaneous fun to be around. Most of all shes available when a bartender leers at her she doesnt hand him his head but instead practically purrs with appreciation. Berrys up there to be eye candy and her desperate desire to be ingratiating makes all the tight leather and exposed flesh seem more than a tad pitiful. At the films close Berrys Catwoman dumps her romantic interest because shes just gotta ramble baby then mews that shes ""bad as I want to be."" In truth Catwoman is as bad as Warner Brothers wants her to be theyre the ones who own the rights to the character. Even though Catwomans been around for more than half a century and her creators dead shes still under copyright--as are most superheroes which is a shame. At one time tales involving communally created characters were told by whoever remembered and could best repeat them; nowadays theyre told by whoever happens to have the ear of the media oligarch who owns the subjects. This produces some lame art and it also keeps a lot of good stuff off the shelves--the excellent live-action Batman TV show featuring Newmar and later Eartha Kitt as Catwoman still hasnt been released on DVD because of licensing disputes. More important though granting corporations the rights to ideas that have for all intents and purposes entered the public domain turns people into passive observers of their own culture--and of the insides of their own skulls. I dont know about you but I dont want Time Warner claiming ownership of any part of my childhood fantasies.

When its Catwoman. Some movies are dead on arrival and by opening day last weekend it was official the latest incarnation of Bob Kanes Batman babe was a bad movie. Most critics panned it; their headline writers have had their fun with it Far from Purrr-fect Should Be Fixed Spits Out a Hairball. The film may be the most easily mocked hymn to feline power since Cats came to Broadway. And this one wont run for 21 years. The movie will also not come close to making back its 100 million production budget and 35 million marketing cost. (It will have grossed less in its first full week than Michael Moores Fahrenheit 9/11 did in its first weekend.) But even a botched action film can offer lessons to the attentive. Here are four Dont Marvel-ize a D.C. comic star. The idea was to give the heroine flaws more suited to a Marvel-comic sensitive lunk like Spider-mans Peter Parker or The Hulks Bruce Banner. But the gorgeous Berry is implausible in this sort of an under-cat role; it demands too great a suspension of disbelief. What alternate universe does the movie dwell in where Halle Berry cant get a man until she gets all leathered up? Rethink Halle Barrys star quality. Maybe shes a star who doesnt need movies. Her iconographic status guarantees that she always comes on strong as in the James Bond Die Another Day and the X-Men series But theres something strange about an actress whose impact is greater with her first impression than her final one. Shes best in passive roles where the only assaultive aspect is her beauty (Monsters Ball) or her bosom (Swordfish). She hasnt the oomph for the sassier parts of her role here  most of which are CGId anyway. Its hard to think that in next years Foxy Brown remake shell be able to invest the emotional heft Pam Grier gave the tatty original three decades ago. Beware directors with one name. Pitof a French special-effects wizard who worked on movies by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Alien Resurrection The City of Lost Children) and Luc Besson (Messenger) has a trapezists love of swooping camera moves but hes lame directing humans. Nor can he make a persuasive connection between the actors and the computer images that eventually infiltrate and take over their characters. (I also wasnt crazy about the Charlies Angels films directed by the monomonickered McG. Though I do love some films especially Mother India directed by the old-Bollywood legend known as Mehboob. And I am on record as having enjoyed Princes 1986 Deco farrago Under the Cherry Moon.) This time the one-namer is likely to leave viewers Pi-tof. Dont let your villain have more luster than your heroine. Sharon Stone who plays an ex-model and eternal bitch named Laurel may represent an earlier generation of star actress than Berrys -- and some might say actress isnt quite the word for Stone -- but she can hijack a scene from a mere Oscar-winner without so much as uncrossing her legs. (And her stunt double and digital stand-in can kick the putative stars stunt doubles and CGI animators butt.) Stone 46 looks preternaturally young here which is the movies one good joke Laurels unnaturally gorgeous face is so pumped-up with chemicals it cracks on contact with the heroines fist. But Laurel is the Catwoman woman wed put in a sequel. It could be called RoBotox. But there will be no Catwoman 2. Which is a real botch since the Selina Kyle character has scored so often before -- notably when played by Julie Newmar (a dozen episodes of the 1966 Batman TV series) and Eartha Kitt (Newmars successor in the second year of Batman). For a potent poignant deliciously wicked Selina stop reading this website right now and go rent Tim Burtons 1992 Batman Returns. And avoid this cat with no life.

It deserves them all. As vacation time nears and every New Yorker I know heads out of town to get as far away from Republican convention gridlock and mayhem as their E-ZPasses will carry them this is the must-see movie event that will make August memorable. As low-budget surprise hits go I predict that when it opens Aug. 6 it will cause the same kind of indie-prod excitement as The Blair Witch Project . Theres one big difference. Open Water is no fad fluke or phenomenon that charges the nerves for the same amount of time as a roller coaster or a video game in a penny arcade. It has been made by real pros has lasting shock value and is miles above and beyond The Blair Witch Project -a movie it in no way resembles-in quality artistry and lasting appeal. It is electrifying. Water. If asked to name my most chilling fear I would have to admit that right up there next to snakes Nazis and bankruptcy I have always had a mortal anxiety about water. Not the kind that comes in designer bottles or picture-postcard waterfalls. Im talking oceans seas rivers and all the creepy stuff below that sucks bites stings and chews human torsos for hors doeuvres. I wouldnt go deep-sea diving on a dare and if you dont think a simple scuba dive in a placid Caribbean coral reef is a pursuit for the insane you will change your mind after Open Water . Based on true events this is a movie about a vital healthy appealing and attractive couple Daniel and Susan (Daniel Travis and Blanchard Ryan) who escape the stress of urban chaos to spend some quality time together on holiday in a beach resort. They sign up for a diving excursion. What happens next left me paralyzed with the kind of terror I can only equate with coming face to face in the garden with a hungry crocodile. The early-morning dive from a pilot boat looks enchanting to the 20 tourists in rubber diving suits onboard. Sixty feet below the surface the angel fish are posing for marine calendars. The excursion is well organized. The deep-sea divers are divided into pairs. Nothing to worry about says the guide. And there are wonders to behold that you dont see in an aquarium. Now it is 1025 the appointed hour when everyone meets for the trip back to the island hotel. To their disbelief when Daniel and Susan reach the surface the pilot boat with the other vacationers has gone without them. Accidentally because of a mistaken head count two people have been left behind deserted and alone cold and shaking kept afloat by life jackets miles from civilization in shark-infested waters. Disbelief turns to anger-directed first at the excursion company then at each other. These are resourceful people but as the stages of psychologicalhorror progresscalm resolve surrenders to panic hysteria and eventually a kind of resignation that left me shaken long after the final shattering moments of this extraordinary film. To stave off starvation and mental exhaustion they play word games.Daniel tries to summon his slowly fading manhood with words of encouragement ""This really sucks but were going to get through this O.K.?"" But being left in the middle of the ocean is an ordeal for which nobody can prepare. Dehydrated unable to drink the water suffering from nausea caused by the drifting and rocking of the lapping waves then tortured by both leg cramps and the venomous bites of passing jellyfish they do everything possible to stay awake and alive. Alas nature has other cruel plans. At the risk of spoiling the suspense I will clam up here. Just take my word Whatever you expect you are in for much more. Applause is richly deserved by the team of writer-director Chris Kentis and his producer wife Laura Lau. They shot this movie on weekends and holidays with the two accomplished believable and completely mesmerizing actors plunged into the water without protective cages for over 120 hours surrounded by real man-eating sharks that give the film most of its harrowing chills. There isnt one computer-generated special effect in the entire film which gives the viewer even more of a feeling of being isolated and abandoned in the middle of nowhere. The Kentis camera not only captures the vast backdrop against which mans vulnerability is supremely tested but acts as a third character-the ocean current the nose of a shark the enemy that sweeps away the couples camera knife food supplies and self-protection. As scary as it is in the sunlight there is no way to evaluate the sheer horror of being in the water after dark lit only by the moon or bolts of lightning. Which is worse? During the day when the sky and the water are as white as an ultraviolet ray you can see the churning of the sharks circling your head. In the pitch-black of night you can only feel the things that are coming after you. Every aspect of this nightmare is captured as realistically as breathing by Mr. Kentis while his screenplay miraculously finds the time to develop character and build rapport between the actors and the audience. You wont know Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis going in but you will crave much more of them both by the time this momentous movie ends. To all and sundry a moment of genuflection please-for one of the most galvanizing and unforgettable films of the year. Cat-astrophic Turn for Halle As a head-turning player in the world of red-carpet photo ops and P.R. sound bites Halle Berry may be pure catnip but as a hissing whip-cracking Catwoman  shes more like a rat buffet. In a desperate ploy to become the female competition for Superman Batman Spider-Man and any number of boring X-Men this flashy superficial blinged-out comic-book superheroine comes crawling out of her cage on all fours in black leather panties and bra like a self-respecting feminists worst nightmare. Come to think of it with its smoke and strobe lights and trashy hip-hop score Catwoman is an intelligent moviegoers worst nightmare too. Based on the least popular and most pointless comic-book character ever invented by Batman creator Bob Kane Catwoman descends from the god-like cats of ancient Egypt where cat mummies have been found in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings. We know this from the elaborate credits made up of vast historic archival information about cats. By day she is Patience Phillips a struggling graphic artist who slaves away drawing ads for a cosmetics conglomerate run by a sleazy opportunist (Lambert Wilson) and his lethal wife a model for the companys beauty products who is being replaced because of her age (played with frozen relish by Sharon Stone). This marble-faced monster is a chic streamlined viper who will stop at nothing to destroy her philandering husband and keep her face in the flossy overstuffed pages of Vogue . When the film begins Patience is already having a bad day-a mysterious cat has invaded her apartment and seems to be stalking her she falls from a window and is saved from death by a handsome cop (Benjamin Bratt) who thinks shes a nut case and shes forced to work overtime or get fired-and its about to get worse. Delivering her new illustrations to the companys cosmetics lab she overhears the evil Ms. Stones plans for launching a new formula for anti-aging cream that contains addictive life-threatening drugs that turn the skin beneath the collagen mask into cancerous sores. Holy Botox Before she can escape and warn the women of the world about toxic beauty cream Patience is drowned resuscitated from her underwater grave by that creepy cat and ready to start the next phase of her existence as ... Catwoman If youve read this far without turning the page maybe you also want to know that she crawls through the night robbing jewelry stores scaling buildings and falling from great heights always landing on her paws. Theres no telling what she could do with a hot tin roof In the process of stretching out a nonexistent plot Ms. Berry also befriends an urban witch (Frances Conroy the funeral-parlor matriarch on HBOs Six Feet Under  in the kind of supporting bit that used to be played by Gale Sondergaard) who diagnoses her condition and warns her that being a catwoman ""can be both a blessing and a curse"" then ravenously devours pounds of canned tuna and purrrrrrs like Eartha Kitt. Sometimes she kids her own predicament with lines fresh from the word processors of not one but three deluded screenwriters who deserve to remain nameless. (Inserting her talons into a villains mouth she hisses ""Cat got your tongue?"") Shes a pretty sloppy date in a trendy restaurant. Wait till you see what she does with sushi. Catwoman is the kind of movie that almost guarantees the loss of a few I.Q. points. It has blinding strobe lights and a deafening New Age beat that consists of the worst rap music ever perpetrated on any member of the film going public over 14 years old and culminates in a claw-and-fang fight to the death between Ms. Berry and Ms. Stone that really kicks butt. Violence and noise is about the extent of the talents of a director named simply ""Pitof"" who cut his baby teeth on French commercials music videos and software designs. Christ dont we have enough hacks right here at home already without importing new ones? Halle Berry slithers through most of this cinematic litterbox as scantily clad as possible in leather lingerie that is supposed to make her look empowered but only makes her resemble a dominatrix in a low-budget porno flick. When she cracks her cat-o-nine-tails in her skivvies its not exciting just deja vu . Ignorant of American film history ""Pitof"" obviously doesnt even know that Ann-Margret did it all years ago in Kitten with a Whip . Lovely and lost Halle Berry is capable of so much more. This kind of kitty litter no doubt earns the big bucks that generate high-fives for agents managers publicists and the I.R.S. but as a career move Catwoman is a cat-astrophe. Gangster Heaven Ill Sleep When Im Dead is another of those sparse restrained and suspensefully subdued gangster films by the celebrated British director Mike Hodges. Thirty years ago he left an instant mark on the gangster genre with his stunning debut film Get Carter  followed almost immediately by the zany compelling Pulp (the last film I can remember that starred the alluring Lizabeth Scott). A few years ago he garnered international critical attention once again with the offbeat Croupier . Now this idiosyncratic director returns with another stylized crime melodrama with faint echoes of Raymond Chandler sex and thuggery unlimited. Smart efficient and brutal Ill Sleep When Im Dead is an avenging-angel film about a former kingpin of the London underworld named Will (Clive Owen who starred in Mr. Hodges Croupier ) who comes out of retirement and returns to his old haunts to avenge the death of his young energetic and attractive younger brother Davey (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) a punk drug dealer who has been raped and murdered by a depraved car dealer played by Malcolm McDowell. Daveys hero worship led him to follow in his older brothers footsteps and now Will feels guilty. Growing from the status of a hermit living out of a van in the woods to a furious crime lord reuniting with his old gang and reclaiming his old power Mr. Owen acts with a ferocious vengeance that gives his character an unrelenting authority. Eschewing the cliches of shoot-outs and bloodshed the director focuses more on illogical underworld fatalism and the nocturnal landscape in which it thrives. You visit a London that is rarely seen by tourists-dank alleys underpasses and cobblestone walkways lit only by a distant neon bar light or simply the moon hovering above the rotted soot-scarred trees. It can be argued that Ill Sleep When Im Dead is more stylized than substantive but I found it a tight well-made evocative piece of filmmaking for true connoisseurs of gangster movies that is unnerving yet completely sure of every step it takes.

No we should be irked that this movie doesnt objectify her more Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News The problem with ""Catwoman"" isnt that it objectifies Halle Berry; its that it doesnt objectify her enough. There are always going to be moviegoers who think its demeaning for an actress to prowl around in a skimpy catsuit -- as if part of being a ""serious"" moviegoer means we need to deny some of the essential reasons any of us male or female go to the movies in the first place. But the more unfortunate reality is that ""Catwoman"" barely acknowledges either Berrys luxe beauty or her quietly glowing charisma -- instead of basking in the considerable charms Berry has to offer the director Pitof (a name that seems naked as if it should have an exclamation mark at the end) treats them like accessories to the pictures flashy senseless cutting and overused special effects. Even if you believe that putting an actress into a slim leather modified Band-Aid outfit instantly turns her into a sex object and nothing more isnt it more insulting when a movie has every opportunity to make an actress a sex object and fails? When Berry isnt slinking around the city at night shes mild-mannered Patience Philips a graphic designer for a big cosmetics company headed by suave slimeball George Hedare (Lambert Wilson). Hedare is about to launch a new face cream. (Its called Beau-Line a lousy name for an anti-wrinkle product although the characters inexplicably pronounce it ""Byoo-LEEN."") Patience a hapless artist type who favors baggy shapeless clothes is in charge of the big ad campaign. But theres a nasty secret behind Beau-Line one that Hedares conniving ex-supermodel wife Laurel (Sharon Stone who looks great in a succession of slim drapy outfits but who should be a lot more fun than the movie allows her to be) is desperate to hide. When Patience becomes privy to Beau-Lines evil side effects shes hastily dispatched and left for dead -- only to be resurrected by a special mystical cat He brings a bunch of his four-footed friends and they surround her lifeless body resuscitating it with their goddess-given restorative purring powers. Thats how Patience becomes the glamorous conflicted semi-superhero Catwoman a powerful part-woman part-feline who fights crime sort of when shes not inadvertently committing it. Patience becomes Catwoman at night and on the morning after she doesnt remember what she did the night before. Even so ""Catwoman"" tries desperately to be a womans empowerment fable. Patience learns that shes part of a long line of Catwomen one of the lucky chosen few who live their lives unconstrained by the rules of society following their own desires. (In most circles going out at night and waking up the next morning with no idea what you did would be considered the exact opposite of empowerment but never mind.) The script was written by John Brancato Michael Ferris and John Rogers from a story by Theresa Rebeck and John Brancato and Michael Ferris. This Catwoman is based but only very loosely on the DC Comics character created by Bob Kane. (Her name isnt even Selina Kyle.) And unfortunately she doesnt have the depth or growly complexity of the earlier Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Batman Returns."" (Its interesting that when Patience is shown a collection of pictures of Catwomen of the past we get a quick glimpse of Pfeiffer in her shiny latex cat mask -- it only makes us miss her more.) The frustrating thing about ""Catwoman"" is that Berry does her damnedest to make the character work. Some of her physical moves are astonishing Her offhanded grace is exceedingly catlike. In one scene as Patience she struts delicately and effortlessly along the back of a couch as she talks on the phone to a friend -- her feet barely seem to touch the surface. As Catwoman dressed in a leather cross-your-heart bra and trouser combo she cracks a bullwhip with vicious ease and her saunter must have been modeled on the way some cats really walk. Although Berrys outfit was obviously designed to highlight her distinctly feminine qualities her strut reminds me of that of a certain self-assured tomcat I know Its a sexually confident sashay one thats predatory and fascinatingly masculine. In a different movie Berry might have had a chance to explore some deeper darker crannies of sexual politics. You Might Also Like But in this one shes all but lost. ""Catwoman"" was shot by Thierry Arbogast the extraordinary cinematographer behind Brian De Palmas ""Femme Fatale"" among other pictures. (He frequently collaborates with Luc Besson a director who has often been fascinated with putting aggressive yet seductive womanly power on the screen.) But for inexplicable reasons the camera doesnt drink Berrys Catwoman in the way it ought to -- I felt I never really had a chance to savor her slinky movements or even to get a really good look at her costume. The fight sequences are choppy and frenetic -- its never clear whos coming at whom or from where and Pitof doesnt seem to really care. And the picture is marred further by too many computer-generated shots of Catwoman leaping across ledges and rooftops. Are we supposed to be more interested in the handiwork of some computer whiz than we are in looking at the real Berry? The story gives Berry a flimsy love interest in the form of a cop played by Benjamin Bratt whos both intrigued by and antagonistic toward the elusive Catwoman. But their chemistry flops -- although its hard to imagine how love or even just lust could ever take root in a picture that has as miserably pinched a sense of mystery and romance as this one does. If ""Catwoman"" fails at the box office it may be stupidly taken as proof that an African-American actress cant carry a big-budget movie. In a New York Times piece earlier this week Sharon Waxman noted that if the movie is successful it will place Berry in the category of the most highly paid women stars and will ""signify yet another achievement for African-American actors."" Waxman understands the realities of the business ""Catwoman"" needs to do well to prove Berrys worth as a star. Even so I think audiences -- not to mention journalists -- should be wary of buying wholesale the idea that any actors ""value"" can be judged on the strength of one movies financial success. I hate to see Berry have to carry that burden particularly in a picture thats so obviously bad in spite of her not because of her. Why does Berry need to be the standard bearer just because of her sex and her race? And beyond that while Im painfully aware of the realities of the moviemaking business I hate the fact that any actor (regardless of color or gender) should be judged by the box-office receipts of any particular movie. Denzel Washington is often used as an example of a male actor of color who can ""open"" a big-budget movie. But while Washington is sometimes a terrific actor other times hes just a dull worthy one He gave a wonderful jazzy performance in the romantic thriller ""Out of Time"" which did poorly at the box office. Yet the perfunctory performance he gives in Tony Scotts deplorable ""Man on Fire"" is the sort of thing Hollywood execs are likely to view as successful. (And as far as Hollywoods providing better roles for African-American actresses goes Yes they need better roles and more visibility. But if the answer is to give them boring ponderously prestigious Meryl Streep-type roles or roles that require prosthetic noses -- well in that context the flashy cat suit doesnt look half bad.) The point is that while we have to acknowledge how Hollywood views actors (sadly as meat rather than people -- or so it often seems) that doesnt mean we as moviegoers have to stoop to that level. Isnt it braver by far to ignore box-office receipts and Hollywood politics and to judge performances for their own sake? If anything because Hollywood is so hung up on profiting off its actors we should be more alive to the subtle gifts theyre capable of bringing to us regardless of how much their movies rake in. Thats another way of saying that as bad as ""Catwoman"" is we shouldnt make the mistake of considering it Berrys failure or worse yet evidence of the unbankability of actresses of color. Its taking forever for actresses of color to find their footing in Hollywood. Berry at the very least is trying to stay on her toes as she leads the way.

"Catwoman Halle Berry As Claws Celebre washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Catwoman Halle Berry As Claws Celebre Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 23 2004 What becomes an Oscar-winning actress most? A skintight black cat suit risque leather bodice straps and a pointy-eared cowl apparently. Halle Berry makes her bid for box-office superstardom in ""Catwoman"" a spinoff of the ""Batman"" franchise that is pretty slim pickings compared with some recent comic book adaptations (not just the ""Spider-Man"" movies but ""X-Men"" and even ""Hellboy"" come to mind). Actually ""slim"" may not be the appropriate word for a film that misses no chance to ogle Berrys bodacious physique. After her dramatic toned-down turn in ""Monsters Ball"" its as if she wants to remind audiences (and the powers that be in Hollywood) that shes really just a pretty face. That she certainly is and for those fans who enjoy reveling in Berrys ravishing physical features ""Catwoman"" gives them a deliciously uninterrupted chance to do so. But the guys to whom ""Catwoman"" might also have appealed might want to take a pass. As one young man in the movies demographic range said of watching Berry strut her stuff ""You can see that in a magazine."" Viewers who were reared on the ""Batman"" television series -- and thus for whom Catwoman will always be indelibly embodied by Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar -- will find the once-villainous vixen much changed. In ""Catwoman"" Patience Philips (Berry) is a meek graphic designer who is killed by her boss at a cosmetics company when she discovers that the companys new beauty cream is toxic. Brought back to life by a mysterious cat (in a scene thats just begging for someone to start belting out ""Memory"") Patience becomes Catwoman a leather-sheathed red-lipsticked supermodel-superhero who vows to avenge Patiences death and help fight crime wherever she sees it. In other words Catwoman is now a good guy. But shes a very bad girl. Strutting around an unnamed city of the future in stiletto boots and brandishing a very big whip she has taken the playful Samp;M sensibility of Kitt and Newmars incarnations to its joyless extreme. ""Catwoman"" was directed by someone named Pitof who reportedly got his start as an editor and visual effects specialist. That provenance is clearly evidenced in a movie that is designed and edited to resemble one big music video a jangly jumble of quick cuts and TV-friendly close-ups that discards such anachronisms as story and character like so much kitty litter. The great thing about the ""Batman"" movies (well the good ones) is that they embraced the television shows camp sensibility while exploring its darker psychological regions; here nothing is embraced or explored. The fun has been whipped right out of it. Still when given the chance Berry does a good job as the transformed Patience whose sudden attraction to catnip and tuna straight out of the can bewilders her as much as her newfound antipathy toward dogs. And she has been given a handsome believable love interest in Benjamin Bratt who plays a dreamy police detective (their impromptu game of one-on-one makes for a sexy if hyper-edited courtship ritual). But despite such appealing elements ""Catwoman"" is dragged down by a paper-thin story the predictable number of fight scenes executed at equally predictable intervals and stock unmemorable characters. The latter include the villain with an indeterminate European accent a chubby best friend and the gay co-worker who punctuates his sentences with a sarcastic ""Hello?"" But the worst by far is Sharon Stones Laurel Hedare the former model and cosmetics queen who becomes Patiences arch-nemesis. After delivering a speech about the fashion industrys disregard for women over 40 (a broadside one could easily imagine Stone delivering to a meeting of Hollywood studio chiefs) Laurel proceeds to engage in the most embarrassing screen catfight since Krystal and Alexis went at it in ""Dynasty."" Here Berry winds up hurling Stone through huge blown-up photographic prints of her own younger image leaving the older actress in a heap her face horrifically scarred. Its an ugly climax with a subtext that seems to engage in the very ills Stone was lamenting moments earlier. ""Catwoman"" concludes not with a triumphant feminist roar but with a dispiriting hiss. Catwoman (104 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality.

Starring Halle Berry Benjamin Bratt and Sharon Stone.Directed by Pitof. PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Catwoman"" is probably not what youre expecting. Its not the usual cartoony summer action blockbuster and its not a special-effects extravaganza. Sure there are special effects in it -- of Catwoman climbing and leaping -- but the images are springy and distorted like something from a video game. This movie is not about its special effects. Its really a movie about women. So tonight a million men will drag their girlfriends to see ""Catwoman"" and will walk out saying ""Wasnt that stupid?"" but the women will know Its not. Rather its an odd idiosyncratic movie -- dark in look and dark in spirit -- that plays as a kind of pop culture investigation into the meaning of feminism and the options open to women in the modern world. Both accidentally and intentionally ""Catwoman"" captures and mythologizes enough strains of modern thinking that the temptation is not to even bother unraveling it. Just stick it in a time capsule and let them sort it out in a few decades. Halle Berry is Catwoman of course but first the movie has to show us how she got that way. Shes Patience a cat lover and commercial artist who designs print advertisements for a cosmetics company. Timid and retiring she lives a solitary life in a crummy apartment with loud neighbors who blast music at 4 in the morning. Shes a woman who plays by the rules and lives a life of vague but ever-present discontent. Patience is contrasted with Laurel (Sharon Stone) a supermodel whose many poses adorn the lobbies and corridors where Patience works. Laurel co- owns the cosmetics company with her husband George (Lambert Wilson) and when we first meet them George is announcing to the board of directors that Laurel who has been the companys face for 15 years is being replaced by a younger model. Its a good scene for Stone who as Laurel maintains the illusion of high spirits while suggesting just enough suppressed rage to unsettle the whole room -- and the audience. The scene tells us everything we need to know about Laurel. She knows no rules. She goes through life smiling and shes enraged. ""Catwoman"" has a dark elegance and stylish moves. In an early scene the director -- who goes by the name of Pitof -- pans from a long shot of Wilson to pick up Stone in close-up. The shot doesnt mean anything; it just looks good. At times he gets carried away filming a simple one-on-one basketball match between Patience and her hunky cop boyfriend (Benjamin Bratt) as a montage to musical accompaniment. Yet for the most part the look is just right a mix of murkiness and glitz that supports the movies weird tone festive pessimism. Patience becomes ""Catwoman"" or rather one of a long line of catwomen when she is murdered and brought back to life by cats. They not only breathe life into her but they also infuse her with their nature. And so Patience soon finds herself devouring sushi sleeping on piles of cushions and climbing up and down the furniture. More significantly she finds herself no longer inhibited by the laws of society. She has ""fierce independence"" and ""total confidence."" She even has a leather outfit and fake cat ears. Its precisely here that the movie should derail but its just getting started. Written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris who collaborated on the story with Theresa Rebeck a Pulitzer finalist in drama ""Catwoman"" celebrates female power but is conflicted in its ideals. It extols independence confidence and rebelliousness but these are qualities Catwoman also shares with Laurel and Laurel is ruthless and evil. Is Laurel a heroine too? The movie makes clear that Laurel is the victim of a husband who has lost interest in her and the screenplay consistently gives her good lines. Without a doubt the film has some ambivalence surrounding Laurel but thats not flaw but a virtue reflecting a similar tension in the world outside the film. Catwoman and Laurel are bound to clash and so inevitably were presented with a contest between the two women -- both of them free independent and unnatural. Catwoman is unnatural because shes practically supernatural while Laurel is unnatural because a toxic face cream has given her ""skin like marble "" and she ""cant feel a thing."" What a metaphor for plastic surgery which turns the human face into an unfeeling mask. I think when the future weighs in on ""Catwoman"" it will decide that its unintended message is that independence is great so long as women dont take it too far. But in the meantime theres Friday night and for Friday night this will do just fine. Its definitely a good matchup -- Stones cynical bravado versus Berrys resilient spunkiness in a world-class cat fight. -- Advisory Sex banter and action-movie violence.

"Hairballs Are More Exciting Than This - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Berry Hairballs Are More Exciting Than ThisMovies - REVIEW - CatwomanNot To Be Catty But Catwoman Is One Of The Worst Superhero Movies Ever Made.July 23 2004|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticLook what the cat dragged in.Its Catwoman arguably the worst superhero film ever made.Remember Batman amp; Robin the travesty that killed the Caped Crusaders film franchise back in 1997? Remember how everyone laughed at how inappropriately kinky it was?Well Catwoman is all kink and no think.As the title character Halle Berry cracks a whip wears what looks like a bondage mask and sports a hot shredded-leather catsuit. Our heroines mysterious mentor like a porn-film guru expounds a libidinous-sounding philosophy.""Catwomen are not contained by the rules of society. You follow your own desires.""But while the films Euro-trash tone is certainly sleazy this PG-13 production cant possibly deliver on its promise of debauchery.And all things considered that is probably just as well.Even the most devoted bat-fans can safely skip this one For some unfathomable reason the film seems to exist entirely outside the Dark Knights orbit.Unlike previous incarnations of Catwoman this one does not begin as someone named Selina Kyle. Instead shes Patience Philips a young woman whose friends call her ""fun-deficient"" and who works as a graphics designer for the slick Hedare Beauty company.When Patience stumbles on the secret that the companys new anti-aging product is toxic gunmen try to kill her. In fact they probably do kill her. But while trying to escape she falls into a chemical pool that with an assist apparently from some cats resurrects her and imbues her with increased strength and feline agility.Sharon Stone plays one of the villains which is sort of funny if you remember that a decade ago in The Flintstones Berry played a villain named Sharon Stone.Anyway Stone and Lambert Wilson play Laurel and George Hedare evil owners of Hedare Beauty.Laurel is a cool platinum blonde whos always rolling her eyes to the ceiling and affecting an ""if they only knew"" expression. George is the sort of boring stock villain who between clenched teeth often says things like ""I do not reward incompetence""Certain plot details dont add up After being shot at Patience doesnt say anything to anyone and just goes back to work at the company that killed her.Being a team player is one thing but this is really too much.Based on Berrys track record it should come as no surprise that the film doesnt work. After all in her entire career in feature films she has appeared in only two really good ones -- Monsters Ball (for which she won an Oscar) and Bulworth.Is it possible her taste in films is even worse than her taste in men?This time she gives a two-note performance weak and timid before she becomes Catwoman confident and naughty afterwards.Stone whose batting average isnt much better has only one note to play ice princess. (Her big ""catfight"" scene with Berry is to borrow a term ""fun-deficient."") And as a cute cop who becomes Berrys love interest Benjamin Bratt struggles mightily not to look too silly and almost succeeds.Catwoman which opens today was directed by something called Pitof that according to the production notes got its start in commercials. That makes sense because the film is big on the sort of glitz that sells hair-care products and fast cars.The 1960s Batman TV series was intentional camp but this is the unintentional kind. To praise anything about this film would not be possible.Like the fiendish George Hedare I do not reward incompetence.

"Fur doesnt fly - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Fur doesnt fly Halle Berry plays a superhero but fails to land on her feet in the clawless Catwoman By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 23 2004 With ""Catwoman"" Halle Berry is out to conquer the box office. To ensure victory she has chosen for herself not a sequel to ""B.A.P.S."" but that most foolproof of summer genres the comic-book flick. She fights crime -- sorry ""fights crime"" -- in tight black low-cut scratched-up leather pants and a sports-bra/bustier that gives her better support than anybody in the movie.So the only risk for Berry would be to her dignity which at this point seems made of titanium. Still watching her run around in that getup I felt embarrassed the way I do for people who put on makeup before climbing a StairMaster -- its too much. I dont want to imply that the costume doesnt flatter Berry; to the contrary actually. She just lacks conviction in it. During a tussle with Sharon Stone whos stuck playing the heavy Stone tells Berry shes pathetic. ""You look like a little girl playing dress up"" Stone says and it stings a little more than it was probably meant to because it seems true. Berry portrays a meek beauty-company graphic designer named Patience Philips in a city that seems a composite not of actual cities but of cities concocted for commercials. And she has a sassy best friend (Alex Bornstein) who seems a composite of other sassy best friends. After Patience overhears that her companys new cream Beauline will erode the skin of any woman who stops wearing it she is killed and brought back to life by a cat that coughs on her. From here shes handy with a whip and endowed with incredible agility.To show off her new skills endless passages give us a digitized Berry flying around rooftops and through sweaty alleys a la ""Spider-Man."" But when Spidey swings through Manhattan were at least aware that hes ecstatic about it. With this compu-catwoman who knows?Our heroine seeks revenge for her murder but twice shes framed for other slayings. Theres also a cop on her tail -- I mean trail and hes played by Benjamin Bratt who puts enough sex in his voice to give you a Billy Dee Williams hot flash. If only someone had put a thought in his characters brain -- Bratts detective appears to have a ""Police Academy"" IQ. At some point Catwoman knocks him about licking and kissing him. Later he goes home with Patience and Bratt is so confused by the similarities he actually has to check with forensics to see if theyre the same woman.True a man is necessary only to win back the women in the audience mystified about why theyve come to see Halle Berry do the ridiculous like slipping her feline frame through the bars of a jail cell. For the movies woeful lack of eroticism we can thank the director a French digital effects guru who goes by the name of Pitof. And as it turns out getting turned on by ""Catwoman"" is beside the point. Shes not in it for kicks or licks for that matter. Shes here to empower. A spinsterish cat lady (Frances Conroy) explains that Patience belongs to an elite group of independent misunderstood female subversives -- no not the great Catwomen throughout popular culture like Eartha Kitt or Michelle Pfeiffer but a more clandestine group that has existed for eons meant to free other women from the shackles of conformity. The Siamese Liberation Army?Berry wears the Samp;M duds but its Stone as Laurel Hedare a diabolical long-in-the-tooth supermodel who seems kinky and gives off what excitement there is to be had. When Catwoman breaks into her mansion Stone seems more thrilled than bewildered. She gives the proceedings a smattering of Hollywood realism too The beauty company replaces her face on billboards which appear all over the movie with a younger one. Laurels campy desperation to keep mattering on the way to 50 seems more crucial than whatever Berrys hero alleges to stands for. Whats happening to Stone and women like her seems like a crime worth fighting. Wesley Morris can reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Catwoman1/2 (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 23 2004 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Mar. 18 2009 1229PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Catwoman Directed by Pitof Written by John Brancato Michael Ferris John Rogers Theresa Rebeck Starring Halle Berry Sharon Stone Benjamin Bratt Classification PG Rating 1/2 star Its nearly a full hour into Catwoman before the ""outfit"" makes an appearance and I wont lie to you Call me biased but the sight of Halle Berry shoe-horned into black leather -- skin-tight pants skimpy bra pointy-ear accessories -- is not at all disagreeable. Savour it guys and gals alike because every odorous frame before and after that sight can be safely consigned to the litter box. By my crude math the bottom line is a picture boasting a 90-million price tag and one fetching outfit -- move over Valentino thats some awfully haute couture. Now when it comes to comic books all dressed up in celluloid -- and our pop culture is coming to little else -- the standards arent exactly demanding. Good is always preferable of course but so-bad-its-good is definitely acceptable. Whats not whats an unforgivable sin is blandness. And when even the blandness gets butchered well call it a hanging offence and round up a posse. As for the culprits lets begin with the committee the gang of four that pummelled some guiltless keyboard and dreamed it was a script. I stake no claim to expertise in the lineage of feline femmes but if recollection serves the genus enjoys a walk on the wild side and displays a certain flair for things villainous. In fact my distinct memory (curvaceously shaped to resemble Michelle Pfeiffer) is that catwomen have been put on this earth to make life hell for batmen. But our committee members it seems have a different idea Apparently afraid for their furniture theyve gone out and declawed the poor creature. Her freshly varnished back story goes something like this The girl has a new alias Patience; a new residence some unnamed metropolis; and a new job toiling in the art department of a cosmetics company. Not just any old LOreal place but one thats about to unload on a world of unsuspecting women an anti-aging cream with some unfortunate side effects. Cut to anguished cry of mad scientist ""I cant live with turning people into monsters"". But the committee can. Theyve turned Sharon Stone as the companys former cover girl into an aging beauty fighting her own battle with Father Time. Spoiler alert She isnt fighting fair. Now back to Patience who in the fine tradition of every hero with a prefix is a mousy little thing until the metamorphosis kicks in. Dying one day she awakens the next with a sudden yen for sushi an uncanny ability to land on her feet and an unfortunate propensity for hokey wordplay -- ""purrrfect"" ""cat got your tongue"" all that ha-ha stuff. Oh and one other enhancement With her resurrected self comes a reborn fashion sense. So bring on the outfit and bring it on fast. You see no outfit no movie -- or did I make that point already? All this is well and fine but what does our costumed kitty do with her prodigious powers? Nothing too bad I assure you. Actually nothing much good either She demonstrates an impressive slam-dunking skill on the basketball court; she saves a kid from tumbling off a faulty Ferris wheel; she waylays a couple of jewel thieves then returns the jewels to their rightful owner; and she allegedly brings a whole new sexual energy to her hitherto tepid romance with Benjamin Bratt. I say allegedly because their making out is damn hard to make out -- frankly youd have to be Owlman to see it. Then theres the climactic set-to with Stone a generational battle of the beauties flashing their respective outfits. In Sharons defence it must be conceded that the playing field isnt really level -- a lovely pant suit however well-tailored just aint no match for leather and a whip. That leaves our posse in dogged pursuit of the cat makers with one last villain to corral The French director known only as Pitof a man whose talent appears to extend no further than his name. Dipping into the budgets expensive bag of computer-generated effects hes managed to create an entire digitalized city that has all the allure of an underground parking garage. And his action its cluttered; his editing its confused. The result blandness butchered hamburger chopped kitty littered. A postscript Reports have it that Berry is hoping to become the first black American woman to successfully ""open"" a summer blockbuster. Maybe so but I credit her with loftier motives. Surely and bravely shes putting herself to the George Clooney test. If his career can withstand that Batman then hers can endure this Catwoman.

On Screen The Cats Me-Ouch Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 23 2004 WE ALREADY sorta knew Halle Berry was a cat didnt we? That slinky walk. Those big blinky-blinky eyes. That soft voice. Purrrr. Here Halle-Halle ""Catwoman"" simply makes it official. Or tries to. In the movie version of the comic book story Berry isnt Catwoman so much as a feline Janet Jackson in a series of glamour videos. Dressed in dominatrix leather she performs vampy catwalks along high city ledges while the fake moon looms large in the night sky. The music rocks. That cat tail swings east and west. And special effects specialist-turned-director Pitof goes crazy with fragmentary editing and slanted camera angles. (The most important contribution a director can make especially one with a single name is to draw attention to himself.) As for the story which details how meek gentle Patience Philips (Berry) came to be Catwoman met a sexy detective (Benjamin Bratt) and defeated a skin cream empire it goes down (and comes back up) like a hairball. Patience is a graphic designer a mere drone at Hedare Beauty the snazzy cosmetics corporation thats about to unleash a radical anti-aging beauty cream. Under the slimy fastidious thumb of George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) the company is about to ditch its spokesmodel Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) also the bosss wife for a newer younger Face. There are bad feelings all around. And in the middle of all this Patience stumbles into a secret backroom meeting and makes a startling discovery. This cream has a rather nasty side effect You have to keep using it. If you dont your face starts to resemble Joan of Arc -- after the fire. Chased by Hedare security goons she retreats into a big sludge tunnel. The bad guys close one side of the tunnel and flush her out over a big drop. No more Patience. That is until a kitty from the Eygptian past (I am not making this up) leans down and breathes life back into her. Theres nothing like sepulchral kitty breath to bring you back from the dead. A new woman emerges one who can scale buildings execute somersaults and beat her opponents with extraordinary agility and nasty claws. Socially there are some problems. She tends to hiss when she sees dogs. She cant keep her eyes off the goldfish. And she loves catnip. Like most superheroes shes going to have to learn how to be social in real life. After all that nice Tom Lone (Bratt) is very interested. Of course theres the matter of getting revenge on the Hedares who killed her. But when Laurel frames Catwoman for murder the slinky scaler becomes a fugitive from the law. She has to persuade Tom whos investigating the case that shes innocent. Meanwhile Tom a professional detective who is in love with Patience doesnt have a clue that the woman behind that teeny face mask is the object of his affections. You have to wonder how many cases this guy has ever closed. Berry is a physical treat for many sets of eyes. And yes it isnt every day that a movie about Manichaean good-and-evil turns on the right formula for skin cream. But these elements are not enough to make this superhero saga very engaging. Its possible that ""Catwoman"" could become an appealing video rental for young female audiences because of its over-the-top celebration of girl power. But other than that theres purrecious little to talk about except to lament a couple of supporting players. Bratt actually does best of all with his throwaway role. Hes almost believable despite his inability to see through Catwomans disguise. But as Patiences friend Sally former ""Mad TV"" star Alex Borstein gives us one of the most annoying sidekicks of all time. She pops her head above the office cubicle partition so much she suggests one of the creatures in those Whack-a-Mole concession games. Stone who finds herself in an utterly thankless role as a sort of peroxide Cruella De Vil must surely miss the days of ""Basic Instinct"" when she was all the rage. Now as Laurel shes lamenting that George Hedare threw her away when she turned 40. Its an apt metaphor for an entertainment industry that chews up its beautiful women just when they start to become really interesting. But in a movie as silly and misfired as this one timely statements only make the experience more painful. CATWOMAN (PG-13 104 minutes) -- Contains cartoon violence and some sensuality. Area theaters.

Lure of Halle Berry as the leather-clad feline should help this mangy misfire claw out a decent opening before a quick slink to DVD. After raising the bar for summer blockbusters with its lyrical and imaginative third ""Harry Potter"" Warner Bros. plummets to the dimmest recesses of popcorn inanity with ""Catwoman"" which even by the standards of comic book adaptations requires a suspension of disbelief surely beyond most audiences. Risible yarn about a mousy underachiever rendered superhuman by arcane pussy power plays like a Lifetime movie on estrogen overdose barely held together by a script that should have been tossed out with the kitty litter. The lure of Halle Berry as the leather-clad feline should help this mangy misfire claw out a decent opening before a quick slink to DVD. Introduced in 1940 as villain The Cat in DC Comics ""Batman"" Catwoman was played in the campy 1960s TV series by Julie Newmar Eartha Kitt and Lee Meriwether emerging as a purrrfidious yet sexually enticing adversary to the Caped Crusader. She resurfaced memorably in Tim Burtons 1992 ""Batman Returns"" as the dangerous alter ego of a schizophrenic secretary played by Michelle Pfeiffer. This latter incarnation appears to have been the template for producer Denise Di Novis furball of a spin-off. While the new film clearly opens doors to further sequels DC Comics may have to wait for Christopher Nolans upcoming ""Batman Begins"" for a more viable franchise. Whats missing primarily in John Brancato Michael Ferris and John Rogers screenplay and in the manic over-pumped music-video aesthetic of French director Pitof is any real sense of fun. The good girl/bad girl duality and internal conflict are so diluted theyre almost absent and the flirtatious behavior that has always characterized the kittenish vixen is aimed not at another superhuman but at a blandly serviceable nice-guy cop. An artist squandering her talents in the advertising department of cosmetics empire Hedare Beauty Patience Phillips (Berry) lands her first big solo campaign on the companys revolutionary new age-reversal goop Beau-line. The launch coincides with the enforced retirement of longtime spokeswoman Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) whos being put out to pasture by her imperious husband George (Lambert Wilson) replaced on billboards (and in bed) with a younger model. At the same time Patience begins a coy courtship with handsome cop Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) who compares her daubings to early Chagall or the Dutch masters in one of the movies more laughable exchanges. One night Patience overhears scientist Dr. Slavicky (Peter Wingfield) fretting about side-effects of Beau-line which transforms flawless skin to pizza if applications are stopped. When the doc starts spouting dialogue like ""I cant live with turning people into monsters"" its clear hes not long for this world. But the same goes for Patience discovered by Hedares goons and sent to a watery death. Washed up on a rocky shore Patience is surrounded by cats and given the breath of life by an Egyptian Mau. Waking up hungry for sashimi and canned tuna Patience seeks an explanation from academic kook Ophelia Powers (Frances Conroy) who lives in a quaint cottage in the otherwise built-up unnamed metropolis. In one of the films many half-baked attempts to push a female empowerment agenda Ophelia explains how Patience was chosen for rebirth becoming a creature both docile and aggressive nurturing yet ferocious unwilling to be contained by societys rules. By this time nearly an hour in Patience is regularly exploring the night in Gucci-esque leather fetishwear hacking off her long tresses for a sexy crop and acquiring blonde frosting. Eager to know who was responsible for ending her previous life she zeroes in on her former bosses. But after initially positioning herself as an ally Laurel is revealed to be far more lethal than George her years of toxic Beau-line treatment giving her a marble-skinned imperviousness to pain. While there should be some pleasure in seeing whip-cracking Catwoman and buff uberbitch Laurel in a kickass face-off the characters are such cardboard cutouts and the action is cut so frenetically that theres neither emotional payoff nor visceral thrills. Stone seems to be enjoying herself more than anyone onscreen but her icy deposed beauty queen feels like a refugee from some 80s Jackie Collins miniseries while Berry appears to be channeling Elizabeth Berkley in ""Showgirls"" in a performance thats all whiplash head-turns and searing glances coated with more body glitter and lip gloss than a troop of pole-dancers. Perhaps because much of her screentime is as meek and awkward Patience theres a serious lack of authority and charisma in Berrys leading turn. Together with her roles in ""Die Another Day"" ""X-2"" and ""Gothika"" Berrys recent choices seem bizarre in their studious refusal to capitalize on the serious-actress validation of her ""Monsters Ball"" Oscar. Bratt is generically charming (despite seeming like the only cop in a huge city) while Wilson appears to have come on set directly from the ""Matrix"" sequels without bothering to step out of character and Conroy deserves better than this. Unimonikered Pitofs background was in visual effects (Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caros ""Delicatessen"" ""The City of Lost Children"") before he graduated to second unit director (Jeunets ""Alien Resurrection"") and to solo director (French hi-def digital feature ""Vidocq""). ""Catwoman"" doesnt suffer from quite the same coldness as those films but theres a severe imbalance in the over-designed universe and the poorly fleshed out figures that populate it. The most arresting sequence is the opening titles which elegantly recap the evolution of the ancient Egyptian Mau breed and women wearing cat fashions over the centuries. Elsewhere Pitofs style is kinetically charged but pays too little attention to nuances of character or storytelling. Some larger set pieces -- like a brush between Catwoman and Lone high above the stage during a Cirque du Soleil-type trapeze act -- seem merely cluttered and messy. On the f/x side Catwomans panther-like prowling and leaping have a jerky artificial look and lack of fluidity. Fight movements based on Brazilian martial arts discipline Capoeira are more convincingly rendered though hampered by the filmmakers overriding belief that editing at trailer speed is the surest way to build excitement. Production designer Bill Brzeskis elaborate setting adheres to the DC Comics spirit in its blend of residential streets with the shadowy cityscape of Catwomans nocturnal playground and the sleek modern design of Hedares HQ all shot in muscular swooping style by French d.p. Thierry Arbogast. Like everything else in the movie Klaus Badelts big synth score tends to be over-emphatic incorporating occasional hip-hop accents. CatwomanProductionA Warner Bros.

Unfortunately for Oscar winner Halle Berry this movie belongs in the litter box. Seriously Benjamin Bratt you cant discern Catwomans identity? Put those Law amp; Order detective skills to work already. Warner Bros. In attempting to bring this comic-book heroine to life Berry lacks the stealthy feline moves that an actress trained as a dancer might have had. Nor does she ooze the eccentric sensuality of Eartha Kitt or the kittenish flirty ways of Julie Newmar both of whom played the character on TV. Berry vamps around in a strategically torn vinyl-like outfit and kinky mask sashaying more like a supermodel than a cat. Her look -- spiky two-toned hair buckets of black eye shadow and red lipstick -- resembles an overzealous dominatrix. Catwomans alter ego the self-effacing Patience Philips wears baggy clothes intended to make her frumpy but Berry still manages to look beautiful. (Related video See a clip from Catwoman) ABOUT THE MOVIE Catwoman  1/2 (out of four) Stars Halle Berry Sharon Stone Benjamin Bratt Lambert Wilson Director Pitof Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality Opens Friday nationwide Patience is a sensitive artist who does a lot of apologizing and downplays her talents. Yet this shrinking violet works as a graphic designer for a cosmetics giant. The company has developed an anti-aging face cream with hideous side effects. Little wonder since it was concocted by the evil heads of the company played by an over-the-top Lambert Wilson and an oddly blank and icy Sharon Stone. When Patience discovers the secret she is disposed of. But she returns to life endowed with a cats agility as well as fierce independence and a predilection for crime. A handsome police officer (Benjamin Bratt) is drawn to both Patience and Catwoman. A predictable outcome ensues enlivened only by one visually arresting scene in which Berry and Bratt play basketball one-on-one. As Catwoman Berry purrs unconvincingly and her hisses are unintimidating. Two gags about a cats appetite for fish are milked much too strenuously. The screenplay is flat and predictable and bad dialogue prevails A scientist who concocted the cream has pangs of conscience and laments ""I cant live with turning people into monsters."" Later when Berry dons her catsuit she sings out like a teen ""Time to accessorize"" The character on the TV show was campy fun and the movie does try to be stylistic and cheeky. But it is mostly off-putting particularly in the protracted and violent catfight between Berry and Stone. Perhaps Berry needs a jolt of catnip to clear her senses From her Oscar turn in Monsters Ball to the disappointing thriller Gothika and now this?

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Not to be catty about it but the stench of the litter pan is all over this big-screen 90 million disaster-in-waiting. Its not hard to see why Halle Berry would want to put on a cat suit and become the first woman of color to play the lead in a blockbuster. After all Berry is the first African-American woman to win the Best Actress Oscar (for Monsters Ball). Sadly Catwoman allegedly a tale of female empowerment declaws her ambitions. She ts out dowdy as Patience Phillips a shy graphic artist at a cosmetics company run by the dictatorial George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his aging model wife Laurel (Sharon Stone) who is also a dick. Then an Egyptian cat breathes new life into Patience which inspires her to fight crime flirt kinky with a cop (Benjamin Bratt) and wear a leather Samp;M outfit that would embarrass Grace Jones not to mention Batman. So much for feminism. The director someone named Pitof uses a flashy editing style that makes the action impossible to follow. Stone gets the better lines telling her husband ""to stop dating children who were born the same year the cell phone was invented"" while Berry is stuck setting up the movie for a sequel.

Yes its a film noir moment not dissimilar to the classic Sunset Boulevard with William Holden facedown in the swimming pool a corpse about to tell his tale.And thats the last time the words classic and Catwoman will ever be used again in this review or I imagine anywhere at any time in the history of the universe.A harmlessly awful adaptation of the comic-book character created by Batmans Bob Kane Catwoman takes place in a city of computer-enhanced skyscrapers and snarly villainy where a mild-mannered graphic designer by the name of Patience Philips toils away for a giant cosmetics concern. One night frantically on deadline Patience tumbles on a sinister plot down at the lab The companys top-selling beauty cream has a few detrimental side effects. Lambert Wilson (Merovingian of the Matrix sequels) and Sharon Stone as the husband-and-wife terrors who run Hedare Beauty have no choice but to eliminate the accidental intruder.This involves flushing Patience down a long series of pipes into the harbor. Unbeknownst to everyone - except perhaps the cat gods of ancient Egypt - the drowned Patience washes up on a landfill surrounded by furry felines. One of the creatures jumps on her limp soggy frame and breathes a mystical breath or two. A magical transformation takes place and meek Patience resurrected finds herself with a sudden and inexplicable craving for canned tuna and catnip.Let the fur fly Its as though Berry - who won a best-actress Oscar two years ago for Monsters Ball - were back in theater class and the teacher had just instructed her to ""act like a cat."" She crouches down and darts her eyes excitedly she paws the air in quick movements she bends and whirls slinks and bounds. Just about the only thing Berry doesnt do is hawk up a hairball.If things begin to go south for the actress careerwise Berry can use Catwoman as an audition reel to land a part in a road company of Cats.Directed by the one-name Frenchman Pitof Catwoman tracks our heroine as she undergoes her meowy makeover - shearing her locks and donning a leather catsuit that looks to be tailored by Fredericks of Hollywood. Benjamin Bratt as a police detective who spends his spare time telling grade-schoolers to be nice isnt sure what to make of Patience. Later on he isnt sure what to make of the babe in black leather either.Bratts cop is described at one point by Patiences work mate as a ""man sandwich"" and in her assertive feline mode Patience eats him up.Catwoman which talks about the ""duality"" inside all women (wild vs. docile rapacious vs. cuddly) does have its guilty pleasures. Most of these come courtesy of ice queen Stone portraying an aging beauty with cartoon campiness. And yes there are catfights - as evil Stone and whip-snapping Berry claw it out.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Read his recent work at http//go.philly.com/stevenrea.Catwoman 1/2 (out of four stars)Produced by Denise Di Novi and Ed McDonnell directed by Pitof written by John Brancato Michael Ferris and John Rogers photography by Thierry Arbogast music by Klaus Badelt distributed by Warner Bros.

"A catnip high - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Catwoman (movie)MOVIES | REVIEW A catnip highCatwoman leavens comic book fantasy with camp sophistication.July 23 2004|Kevin Thomas | Times Staff Writer ""Catwoman"" is as swift and light on its feet as its heroine Halle Berry. Though stylish and full of technical razzle-dazzle no special effect or cliffhanging stunt overshadows Berry in the role as a mousy diffident office worker reincarnated as the sexy glamorous superhuman Catwoman. Berry clearly has fun playing an action heroine yet her part also requires her to integrate two radically different personalities. Catwoman is a staple of the Batman adventures but this is the first time shes had a movie all her own.""Catwoman"" is also pure camp with its comic book antics and its mythological hocus-pocus fantastic plot developments and one-dimensional arch villains. Not everybody will be able to swallow its heady romanticism yet its French director Pitof has brought sophistication to a comic book sensibility which helps some purple patches of dialogue along with other absurdities. What is catnip to some may be a turnoff to others.Ultimately Berrys Patience Philips must accept that she is Catwoman retaining her sense of right and wrong -- not without a struggle -- and her knowledge that along with freedom comes isolation and loneliness. Pitof brings to a script by many hands the same kind of romanticism that envelops Louis Feuillades 1915 silent ""Les Vampires"" which features the intrepid black bodysuited and masked Irma Vep.Berrys well-named Patience is an aspiring Manhattan artist who has gotten stuck in a job as a graphic designer for a major cosmetics conglomerate. It is run by an egotistical tyrant George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) who has just dumped his own wife (Sharon Stone) a onetime supermodel as his corporate logo in favor of a younger woman. (Cold and ruthless Stones Laurel bitterly remarks that ""I do"" was the last meaningful statement her husband ever made to her.) Hedare has also just announced a new product which actually reverses the aging process but of course theres a dangerous hitch to it.Earlier theres a credibility-straining sequence in which Patience climbs out her loft window to rescue a cat a foolish act that nearly costs her life -- OK it is a gesture in keeping with Patiences dutiful nature. The far-fetched moment does have a double payoff First the cat is not an ordinary alley cat but significantly a rare Egyptian mau and second a handsome policeman (Benjamin Bratt) enters the plot coming to her rescue and becoming immediately smitten by her. This brings Bratts Tom Lone into the action before Patience is transformed into the black-leather-clad and masked Catwoman adding to her intrigue as her personality changes.""Catwoman"" is sleek with all manner of spectacular and glamorous settings such as the vast Hedare headquarters and the Hedare mansion which is a Beaux Arts version of the White House just as big and lots more sybaritic inside. The action is plentiful and amusing but does not overwhelm Catwoman herself.Bratt is a dashing sensitive yet forceful foil for Berry and as villains Wilson a veteran French leading man and Stone could scarcely be nastier. Bratt and Stone have a fierce confrontation which frankly is all the more fun now that it has been revealed that she rejected him as a potential leading man in a projected ""Basic Instinct 2."" (Perhaps Stone did not see Bratts extraordinary performance in the 2001 ""Pinero"" as the tormented poet and playwright Miguel Pinero.) Frances Conroy plays an elegant and enigmatic cat fancier who sees Patience as a reincarnation of the Egyptian goddess Bast sacred protector and avenger of women who possessed the head of a cat.CatwomanMPAA rating PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality.Times guidelines Standard genre violence which may be too intense for small children.Halle Berry...Patience Philips/CatwomanBenjamin Bratt...Tom LoneSharon Stone...Laurel HedareLambert Wilson...George HedareFrances Conroy...Ophelia PowersA Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow presentation.

On my file cabinet at work facing me are photographs of three dogs two of which Ive actually met. Between them sits a stuffed toy replica of the Taco Bell Chihuahua that someone put there as a joke. It never occurred to me to take it down. I love dogs. Always have. If anything could make me change my allegiance it would be Halle Berry in an artfully ripped skin-baring leather cat suit copper skin glistening her lips slightly parted. The best parts of Catwoman feature her just like that. And walking. Man can she walk. But I digress. There are no dogs in Catwoman. There are however lots and lots of cats. The star cat -- Midnight -- doesnt look like much but its a rare Egyptian Mau with mystical powers. Cats unlike dogs dont take direction well and they cant really emote so a computer-generated feline is used for a few scenes. Midnight served as a goddesss messenger thousands of years ago. As near as I can figure its spent the centuries sniffing out hot but mousy women who are about to die so it can revive them with its cat breath. The women bounce back with catlike powers an instinctive knowledge of martial arts and a kinky fondness for whips. Oh and they walk really really well. Berry plays Patience Phillips a graphic artist for an evil corporation that makes habit-forming illness-inducing skin cream. We know the corporation is evil because the president speaks with a foreign accent has ramrod posture and dresses impeccably. So anyway Patience becomes Catwoman -- the first part of the movie is insufferable so well skip it -- and then she fights with Sharon Stone who plays the evil presidents wife has skin like steel and may be more evil than he is. Youd never know Berry is an Oscar-winning actress -- her performance as Patience is downright amateurish -- and the character has little relation to the Catwoman in the Batman comic books and movie. But these are minor points as insignificant as the shabby story. Its all just an excuse for Berry to slink around in her cat suit and crack her whip. Men with guns chase her a lot but Catwomans too quick and agile. One of the men is a detective played by Benjamin Bratt. Hes dating the unbelievably meek and strange-dressing Patience but he along with everyone else thinks her alter ego is a murderer. Isnt that how it always goes? The 90 million movie is loaded with special effects -- Catwoman can climb walls and leap off skyscrapers like Spider-Man. Pitof the single-named French-born director started out in graphics and visual effects so the movie looks good in the immaculate meaning-free way of television commercials. But the best special effect by far is Berry and her slinky sexy catlike walk. Oh and her eyes Its amazing the way a cat mask draws attention to their beauty. If only the script were half as nice.

"Dismal Catwoman purr-fect for litter box - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Dismal Catwoman purr-fect for litter box`CATWOMAN (star)July 23 2004""Catwoman"" arrives in the theaters as the ""Showgirls"" of superhero movies.This is not a compliment. A vacuous lingerie show posing as feminism its the biggest movie hairball this side of ""Garfield.""Halle Berry plays Patience Philips an art de signer at cosmetics conglomerate Hedare Beauty who gets bumped off by boss Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) when she learns that the companys new wrinkle cream is not only addictive but hideously damaging to its users. (This is surely metaphor for Botox and possibly for ""Catwomans"" effect on Oscar-winner Berrys career.)Mysteriously Patience is resurrected as a Catwoman one in an ancient line of independent-minded she-warriors whose purpose is never explained or explored. Perhaps they just like the leather getup.Single-named director Pitof previously the visual effects wiz for films such as ""The City of Lost Children"" and ""Alien Resurrection"" makes Berry look good. His cinematography sizzles and his computer-generated environments blend in nicely with physical elements. Hes a confident talented visual craftsman but his feeble handle on the dramatic neuters any emotional connection we might have with Patience or her love interest-cum-scratching post Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt).Particularly obnoxious is ""Catwoman"" posing as a feminist call to arms. Screenwriters John Brancato Michael Ferris and John Rogers (notice all male) seem to comment on societys obsession with unattainable beauty at any price. In fact the cosmetics industry that feeds on and profits from female anxiety creates the movies villainess Laurel Hedare (get it? ""He dare"").Enraged at being replaced as the company spokesmodel by her husbands (Lambert Wilson) new fling Hedare wants blood. When shes backed into a corner Laurel snarls ""Im a woman. Im used to doing all kinds of things I dont want to do""But here again the filmmakers perpetrate a false trope. Playing on a strange unwritten rule in the superhero genre we have a female hero pitted against a female villain--the implication being that superpowered women arent equal to superpowered men.Whose behind did Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) kick in the last ""Batman"" movie? Poison Ivy (played by Uma Thurman). In ""Supergirl"" caped star Helen Slater went toe-to-toe with Faye Dunaway. Only in 1992s ""Batman Returns"" does Michelle Pfeiffers Catwoman seek revenge on crime boss Max Shreck played by Christopher Walken--a menacing figure but still not a male supervillain.A feminist reading of ""Catwoman"" would take issue with the recurring choice of pitting scantily clad women against other sexy flesh-baring ""bad girls.""Worse yet is the filmmakers use of feline metaphor. The catsuit almost always underscores the characters feminine power sensuality danger and grace.Yet Pitof makes the metaphor literal endowing his Catwoman with enhanced agility sight and sense of smell. This leads to embarrassing sequences of Berry hissing messily eating from tins of tuna scattered on her bed and worst of all rolling a ball of catnip junkie-like all over her face. Thankfully we dont have to watch her chase mice or deal with hairballs and for this small favor we can be grateful.At least that is until the outtakes are released on DVD.`Catwoman(star)Directed by Pitof; screenplay by John Brancato Michael Ferris and John Rogers; photographed by Thierry Arbogast; music by Klaus Badelt; production design by Bill Brzeski; edited by Sylvie Landra; produced by Denise Di Novi and Edward McDonnell.

At the E-Walk the Cinema 1 the Harlem USA others July 22 2004 -- Apurr-fectly ridiculous and boring cat-astrophe ""Catwoman"" more than lives up to the lethal advance buzz and - even with Halle Berry cavorting like a third-rate dominatrix - is about as sexy as a hairball. The credits claim this 90 million bomb is ""based on characters created by Bob Kane"" but this version bears virtually no resemblance to the feline comic-book villain so memorably played by Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burtons infinitely more entertaining ""Batman Returns"" much less Catwomans TV incarnations by Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar. Given the feeble script - attributed to four writers - and the inept direction by a Frenchman who understandably resorts to the pseudonym of Pitof its small wonder that Warner Bros. divorced Catwoman from the Batman franchise and Nicole Kidman wisely turned the role down. Instead of Batmans Selina Kyle Berry gets to play Patience Phillips a meek put-upon graphic artist who is verbally abused by her haughty cosmetics-company boss Hedare (Lambert Wilson essentially reprising his role from ""The Matrix Reloaded""). She is also somehow unable to get a date even though she is the most drop-dead gorgeous woman in the building. When she accidentally discovers that the second most drop-dead gorgeous woman in the building - Hedares supermodel wife and partner Laurel (Sharon Stone) - is hiding the fact that the firms new beauty cream will actually disfigure women poor Patience gets flushed into the river with a load of toxic waste (which can easily be confused with this movie). Brought back to life by an Egyptian cat named Midnight who imbues her with magical powers - and mentored by a mysterious professor (Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"") - Catwoman sets out to find her killers. The apparently few fans of the trailers will be disappointed to learn that Patience doesnt don her silly-looking strategically ripped catsuit until nearly an hour into this 91-minute movie and we dont see Catwoman a whole lot after that. The audiences uh patience is tried by far too much footage of a lame chemistry-free romance between Patience and Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) a police detective who is too dim even to suspect his new girlfriend is really the scantily clad Catwoman even after Patience scampers out of a malfunctioning Ferris wheel to rescue a little boy. This sequence is handled as clumsily as all of the other action sequences which have been severely edited in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the fact that the computer-generated version of Catwoman looks nearly as phony as the real thing. Pitof (real name Jean-Christophe Comar) a visual-effects supervisor for Jean-Pierre Jeunet borrows the supersatured color look his mentor used in ""Amelie"" and does offer some striking vistas of the Vancouver skyline (standing in for an unnamed American city). But he has absolutely no clue how to direct his actors. Unsure whether to play it seriously or for camp value Berry laps up cream chows down tins of tuna sniffs at catnip hisses at dogs and wields a whip. The overall effect suggests less female empowerment than an Oscar winner who would endure almost any humiliation for a 12.5 million paycheck. Stone - who with the help of a surgeon and/or special effects looks younger here than she did in ""Basic Instinct"" 12 years ago - clearly realizes its all a crock. She steals what isnt nailed down with a way way over-the-top performance as Laurel who is furious with her husband for replacing her as the companys ""face"" with his younger model girlfriend because shes just turned 40. ""Catwoman"" is pretty well summed up by Hedare ""This is a disaster. Its a total bloody disaster.""

With Halle Berry Sharon Stone Lambert Wilson Benjamin Bratt. Director Pitof (144). PG-13 Action violence sensuality. 1.5 Stars. Halle Berry needs to take out her Oscar every morning - the 2002 Best Actress Oscar she lauded as a breakthrough for women of color - and swear to it that she will not accept any more demeaning stupid roles. Unfortunately its too late to do anything about ""Catwoman"" which litters the nations screens beginning at midnight tonight. It stars Berry in a cat-eared beanie and Sharon Stone camping it up as if shes in a ""Columbo"" episode. The plot has to do with product safety. Theres a moisturizer coming to market that could disfigure the faces of vain women everywhere and only Catwoman can prevent this catastrophe. Big yawn. Not to be catty but this movies raison detre is to dress the incomparably gorgeous Berry in leather and turn her into a kitten with a whip. That is not a bad thing in and of itself. But a movie needs more than a few sexual innuendos and throaty purrs to keep us from taking a catnap. How about a strong story and credible characters? Stripped of all relation to the Batman comics from which Catwoman sprang the character in this movie is a stand-alone superhero whose motivations remain murky. Patience Philips (Berry) is a mousy graphic artist who felines up with the help of a mysterious Egyptian Mau a particularly beautiful breed of cat whose leopard-like markings speak of wild ancestry. Patience is murdered after overhearing that the cold cream being marketed by her employer can cause scarring. Her body winds up on a garbage heap where the areas cats gather no doubt to discuss whether PETA should protect them from looking ridiculous in movies like this. The alpha cat of the bunch an Egyptian Mau with the aid of sloppy CGI breathes some strong salmon-y breath into the dead girls mouth. Patience arises with a new fondness for sushi leather heights and vengeance. Its like an overnight assertiveness training course although Patience seems to go in and out of her newfound persona for no good reason. She stands up to her boss (Lambert Wilson dripping with condescension) and then tumbles all over herself to apologize when everyone knows that being a cat means never having to say youre sorry. A subplot has Benjamin Bratt as a cop trying to date Patience. He falls for her when shes still shy and a bad dresser but hes also attracted to the boldness and long fingernails of Catwoman which speaks to the duality of human nature or to a lazy script. The director is Jean Christophe Comar who goes by the moniker ""Pitof."" He is mostly known for his work in digital effects but the sequences in which Catwoman bounds through the city are on par with a low-budget video game lacking the physics to even suggest human heft. Another subplot one that had the audience at a recent preview guffawing involves Frances Conroy (""Six Feet Under"") as the chief can-opener for a houseful of cats invested with mystical properties. The cats all look like theyre biding time until something better comes along.

"Catwoman | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; catwoman ) Catwoman (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Without pussyfooting around I can state that Catwoman is a catastrophe. An amalgamation of bad clichA(c)s purr-loined from other better superhero movies (not that there are many - if any - that can be considered worse) this motion picture is an embarrassment to all involved from single-named director Pitof (whose moniker sounds like something often done to rice) to Halle Berry who has by now thrown away all of the goodwill she gained from appearing in Monsters Ball. One is tempted to say that ritual disembowelment is too good for those who have perpetrated this abomination on the comic book-loving movie-going public. But that would be hyperbole if only barely. For about four decades DC and Marvel Comics have been engaged in a sometimes amicable sometimes vitriolic battle for domination of the comic book marketplace. More recently the battle has spilled over into multiplexes where until 1999 DCs preeminence was indisputable. To counter DCs Batman and Superman franchises all Marvel could boast were a few lame titles and some vague plans to bring their most beloved properties to the silver screen. Five years later the previous landscape has been obliterated in the wake of features devoted to X-Men Hulk and Spider-Man. This summer the battle pits Marvels Spider-Man 2 against DCs Catwoman. No points for guessing which one wins. The idea for a Catwoman was first conceived shortly after Michelle Pfeiffer made an impression as the character in the second Batman movie. For a while Pfeiffer was attached to the project. Eventually either because she lost interest or grew older than Hollywoods female age ceiling the rumor mill replaced her with Ashley Judd then Halle Berry. Whats amazing is that some time during the dozen years when this project was churning behind-the-scenes at Warner Brothers no one had the good sense to put a stop to it. This is how train wrecks happen - brakes are not applied in time to prevent an expensive and career-damaging accident. It remains to be seen whether Catwoman will do for Berry what Gigli did for Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez but one thing is clear compared to Catwomans kitty chow Gigli is caviar. With the exception of a bizarrely placed black-and-white photograph of Michelle Pfeiffer in her cat suit Batman Returns is forgotten. Those who remember the film however will note that significant portions of Catwoman are regurgitations with an actor named Bratt standing in for a man-sized bat. Of course Brattmans Tom Lone isnt nearly as impressive as Michael Keatons Caped Crusader. Hes just Berrys bitch-boy. The Academy Award-winning actress is so awful in this film that words fail me. Its difficult to decide whether shes channeling Eartha Kitt or Pulp Fictions The Gimp. And on those rare occasions when she attempts a one-liner it is met with hoots of derision. (Part her delivery and part the words she has to deliver.) Berrys performance might have been campy enough to enjoy on its own had the tone of Pitofs epic been less somber. The director seems to view himself as an auteur. Then again so did Ed Wood. As for Berry I sense a Razzie in her future. (When was the last time an actor went from Oscar to Razzie in only a few years? Has it ever happened?) Patience Phillips (Berry) is an ad exec at a cosmetics company run by a Really Nasty Guy named George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his Hell Hath No Fury bitch of a wife Laurel (in a role devoured by Sharon Stone clearly happy not to have been forgotten by someone). Patience sees something she shouldnt is killed by Laurels minions then is brought back to life by a cat (who I guess is in between naps). Thereafter she begins to exhibit catlike abilities and chooses to use these for the good of mankind revenge and stealing a few trinkets. Brattman is around to be rescued and romanced. Another Marvel vs. DC note. Marvel gives us Alfred Molinas delightful Doc Ock. DC gives us Sharon Stones Laurel Hedare. And she doesnt have the instinct to spread her legs to help even the odds. Pitof directs MTV-style. He cuts during action sequences every 0.5 seconds to make sure that the viewer can never be sure exactly whats going on. Aside from agitating people with motion sickness this approach allows a male stunt double to stand-in for Berry without the Y-chromosome being noticed. In the close-ups its obviously Berry. However while Pfeiffers stint as Catwoman caused a leather cat suit mini-fashion rage the only place where Berrys costume will be popular is in Samp;M circles. And most people into that lifestyle already have similar paraphernalia. One is tempted to say that the only reason to see this movie is to ogle Berrys body but since she has shown more flesh in better movies (Swordfish for the popcorn crowd; Monsters Ball for those who prefer dramas) thats not much of a selling point. As poorly written ineptly directed and hideously acted as Catwoman is its biggest sin is that its boring. This movie does not offer a single worthwhile interesting or exciting scene. The action is dull predictable and repetitive. Ever thought a catfight between Sharon Stone and Halle Berry could rival a dose of valium as an effective sleep-inducer? I suppose Pitof deserves a measure of respect for being able to achieve something I would have argued was not possible. Catwoman treads close to the so-bad-its-enjoyable line but at least for me it fails to cross over despite a valiant attempt. As far as Im concerned its just plain bad. Nothing redeeming here. Others who are either more generous than I or drunk at the time of their assessment may be able to uncover some camp value. I wish them luck because such a quest means that they will have to sit through the movie. Despite its feline pretensions Catwoman belongs to another animal family - its either a dog or a turkey.
