Photo Murray Close MOVIE REVIEW THE DIVERGENT SERIES ALLEGIANT Running time 121 minutes. Rated PG (bloodless violence partial nudity). Just when Donald Trump has turned the walled city of future Chicago from ""Divergent"" into an accidental political metaphor Shailene Woodleys Chosen One of this interminable young-adult saga packs up and moves to what remains of OHare International Airport on the citys outskirts. If youve ever found a layover at OHare stultifying its a positive joy compared to what happens there in ""The Divergent Series Allegiant"" the third installment of four films derived from Veronica Roths dystopian novels. By this point none of the pieces fits and absolutely nothing makes any sense. Woodley and the other cast members plodding their way through the inanities and plot craters of ""Allegiant make say Chris Christie look positively perky. The Chosen One Tris ventures beyond Chicagos walls with intensely vacant boyfriend Four (Theo James) and the increasingly annoying Peter (Miles Teller) -- as well as the underutilized duo of Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and Caleb (Ansel Elgort) -- to find a despoiled land utterly at odds with the verdant fields depicted at the beginning of the first film. They are taken on what amounts to an armed airport shuttle to meet with David (Jeff Daniels no doubt subsidizing his current run on Broadway) a high-ranking officer of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare who blathers on about how ""pure Tris genes are. (From left) Zoe Kravitz Shailene Woodley Theo James Ansel Elgort Maggie Q and Miles TellerPhoto Murray Close And then he shows how she was kidnapped from her parents in ""the fringe and brought to Chicago to be raised as part of a sinister-sounding ""experiment whose aims are never really made clear. David is the sort of character who loudly chuckles when Tris asks if she should trust him -- and this supposedly smart heroine stupidly trusts him anyway. On a trip to the Providence RI airport (presumably we visit JFK in next years finale ""Ascendant) to meet with the Bureaus board of directors Tris learns that what David really wants is funding for a nutty plan to end the civil war between the former Chicago factions headed by Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and Johanna (Octavia Spencer). While the faction business was getting pretty tired -- I couldnt tell you for the life of me exactly what these two groups are fighting over -- the special effects this time around do slightly exceed the pretty low standard set in the first two films. Certainly no one goes to these films for the stiff acting -- and the exposition-to-action ratio in ""Allegiant"" is dangerously low. A lot of the talk concerns the fact that as part of his experiment David has equipped Chicago with pipes to dispense memory-erasing gas. Why exactly would he do this? And precisely why would David install a system that could only be operated from inside the city when he has an elaborate surveillance system so he can watch everything from OHare? By the time David gets someone to unleash the gas I was wishing he could simply erase all memories of the sorry ""Divergent franchise.

"The Divergent Series Allegiant - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The Divergent Series Allegiant Posted by Christy Lemire on March 20 2016 2 Comments Lionsgate Films Rated PG-13 for intense violence and action thematic elements and some partial nudity. Running time 120 minutes. One star out of four. The confused look on the faces of all the characters in the above photo pretty much tells you everything you need to know about ""Allegiant"" -- Im sorry ""The Divergent Series Allegiant."" Because three films into the franchise the title is now being elongated with extra punctuation and everything. It ""matters"" now. Whereas the original ""Divergent"" from 2014 had the excitement of discovery working for it this ones bafflingly self-serious. They just keep getting worse. Following last years ""Insurgent"" this ones just a total slog. And unfortunately its not over. As is always the case with movie series based on young adult novels the third book in Veronica Roths trilogy is being broken into two films. The ""Harry Potter"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises employed this tactic with greater success. With ""Divergent"" it feels more like a threat than a promise You thought we were done here? Think again. ""Allegiant"" is one overlong dour placeholder for the actual finale due out next summer. In theory though the premise sounded exciting. This time plucky Tris (Shailene Woodley) her hunky boyfriend Four (Theo James) and their ragtag band of buddies dare to climb the wall that surrounds Chicago in this dystopian near-future to see whats on the other side. Thats been the mystery all along Whats out there? How could it be more dangerous and soul-sucking than whats in here? With the overly simplistic faction system having been dismantled -- and Kate Winslets power-mad Jeanine out of the picture -- they feel emboldened to be the best version of themselves they can be and explore the outside world. What they find though are terrible special effects. Director Robert Schwentke who also helmed last years ""Insurgent"" has created a craggy reddish-fuchsia world where toxic rain bleeds from the sky. It vaguely resembles Mars but the quality of the visuals is more reminiscent of how crappy the green-screen effects looked in Robert Rodriguezs ""Spy Kids"" movies (especially the later ones). A nightmarish landscape thats meant to be frightening -- or at least unsettling -- ends up being hilariously cheesy instead. But Tris and Four also find themselves in the midst of a weird Holocaust allegory. (And maybe this was how it went down in Roths book -- honestly I only read the first one.) Children are separated from their parents and rounded up in the name of scientifically achieving genetic purity. (One little boy watches as his father is shot to death right in front of him.) When Tris Four and their pals are taken into custody by members of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare -- er rescued from this vast post-apocalyptic wasteland -- theyre told to throw their clothes into an incinerator before stepping into a shower for ""decontamination."" (The gooey golden pods that protect them from the elements as theyre carried to safety look especially stiff and strange.) What are we meant to take from this I wonder? Is it intended as a cautionary tale? A source of chills and thrills? Im not sure the film itself even knows. Having a seasoned actor like Jeff Daniels playing the bureaus creepy chief lends a bit of gravitas but his character is so obviously evil that theres no question or suspense as to his intentions. Octavia Spencer and Naomi Watts (in a terrible brunette dye job) as warring Chicago leaders show glimmers of feistiness but even strong versatile actresses like these can only do so much with what theyre given on the page. (The script is credited to Noah Oppenheim Adam Cooper and Bill Collage.) And then intermittently ""Allegiant"" makes the mistake of trying to be funny. Mostly this comes in the form of Miles Teller as the slithery opportunistic Peter whose own allegiances flip-flop to suit his purposes. Basically Teller has been tasked with showing up and being snarky on cue. Not only is this jarring its an example of the entire supporting cast (including Ansel Elgort as Tris uptight brother and Zoe Kravitz as her confident friend) being reduced to one-note roles which has been a problem throughout the series. Anyway Tris must decide between being special in the eyes of of a dastardly genetic purist and special in the eyes of the handsome young man who loves her. Being confused as shes tugged in both directions is not Woodleys strong suit; an accessible abiding naturalism is. Here shes been rendered strangely inert despite the innate physicality of the role. Perhaps next years ""Ascendent"" will allow her to be her own woman once and for all. But I wouldnt hold my breath despite the contaminated air.

"Allegiant | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; allegiant ) Allegiant (United States 2016) March 18 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Allegiant exemplifies what happens when a book or movie exists solely for the purposes of placating fans and maintaining a revenue stream. Craft and originality are swapped out for familiarity and sameness. Plot turns into a regurgitation of not only genre tropes but the series own past. Character development becomes perfunctory (bordering on non-existent). Sure Allegiant boasts some well-crafted action scenes and thin social commentary but its another step backward for the Divergent franchise which started out with much promise two years ago before stumbling in 2015s Insurgent. Rather than showing a ""return to form"" Allegiant causes viewers to wonder whether this is representative of ""form."" Allegiant falls into the insanely popular YA (Young Adult) Dystopian Sci-Fi category. As such it shares common themes with Big Sister The Hunger Games and Big Brother The Maze Runner. Although similarities to The Hunger Games are more superficial than substantive (despite Tris coming across like a diluted version of Katniss) the Divergent series tracks closely enough to The Maze Runner to create confusion in the minds of the unconverted masses. Both tell essentially the same story albeit with variations. Also like many YA franchises Divergent has elected to split the final book of the trilogy into two movies. The result? The motion picture Allegiant tells only half the story presented in the novel Allegiant. Viewers will have to wait 18 months for Ascendant to see how it all ends... if they still care by that time. To be fair unlike Breaking Dawn and Mockingjay Allegiant has the decency not to conclude with a cliffhanger. The movie feels like it ends rather than merely stopping. [Spoilers for the previous installment Insurgent follow.] Allegiants storyline is half-retread half-filler. Like Insurgent the plot focuses on having Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her posse - lover Four (Theo James) brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) bff Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and frenemy Peter (Miles Teller at his snarky best) - escaping from Chicago then finding their way back again. (I have done that a time or two myself.) One of the problems with Allegiant is that lacking a credible Big Bad Guy it needs to invent a new one. Thats what happens when you kill of the villain at the end of the second film. Poor Jeff Daniels is given the unenviable job of filling Kate Winslets shoes. They dont really fit. We know Daniels David is up to no good the first time we see him. Its something about the insincere smile. So after he turns out to be less of a savior and more of a Donald Trump-type Tris and her friends are running away from him and back toward Fours mom Evelyn (Naomi Watts). Meanwhile snake-in-the-grass Peter is up to no good but hey hes not really bad hes just misunderstood. And after being mistreated by Oscar winner J.K. Simmons we cant help but feel sorry for the guy (although some of that sympathy goes away on consideration of Fantastic Four). Allegiant tries to cram too little story into too much time. This results in dead spots and uneven pacing. Some stretches are painfully dull with canned dialogue and lifeless character interaction failing to liven up the proceedings. Whatever happened to the smoking chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Theo James that made parts of Divergent so giddily fun? Now theyre like an old married couple comfortable in each others presence but with minimal evidence of sexual attraction. Its as if having established everything in Divergent - the setting the people the situation the creative minds behind the series have coasted on those beginnings. Not having read Veronica Roths novels I cant say if this is a fundamental issue with the source but the result on screen is unsatisfying. Allegiants climax is to be blunt idiotic. Oh its fun in a B-movie sort of way with ominous clouds of red smoke crawling along the ground threatening to overspread all of Chicago but it doesnt take a degree in physics (or even a basic understanding of the laws of thermodynamics) to sense theres something wrong with the mists properties. Its distracting and the scenes are played almost like a parody of the cheesy science fiction TV series and movies of yesteryear. I laughed a few times during these scenes but Im pretty sure that wasnt director Robert Schwentkes intention. (Or maybe it was and Im underestimating him.) Thankfully Summit Entertainment has abandoned the 3-D experiment it tried for Insurgent. Visually Allegiant is all the better for it. Schwentkes interpretation of a post-apocalyptic Midwest isnt original but at least it isnt muddied by poor post-conversion 3-D. The special effects are limited - competently done but not eye-opening. Aircraft design for example is generic sci-fi 101 (although the ships ability to protect passengers during crashes is impressive). Potential viewers of Allegiant can be divided into three groups. The first fans of the novels will see the film regardless of how ""good"" or ""bad"" it is and their interpretation will be based on how well it matches the images they have created in their minds based on Roths writing. (Although I have heard theres a lack of love among readers about the novel Allegiant.) Then there are those who havent see one or both of the previous productions. Theres nothing here to encourage them to re-think things and climb on board. Finally there are those who havent read the books but have seen the previous movies. Allegiant is most likely to disappoint them because of its lack of vision and direction. The franchise feels stalled and theres nothing here to generate anticipation for the next (and last) installment. Its as if the Divergent series has already ended but the filmmakers havent recognized it.

If you were hankering for more scenes of Jeff Daniels standing around talking youll find an unlikely ally in the new young-adult sci-fi sequel Allegiant the third entry in the Divergent series based on Veronica Roths hit novels. Too bad the stuff hes saying is so dopey. The more these movies try to explain themselves the more they undermine the initial simplicity and relatability of their concept.In the first Divergent we were presented with a futuristic dystopia divided strictly along personality lines not unlike an American high school. There we watched our teenage heroine Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) a/k/a Tris break ranks with her own faction of Abnegation (known for its selflessness) and join in with the wild physically fit folks of Dauntless falling in love with her trainer Four (Theo James) along the way. In the follow-up Insurgent Tris and Four helped lead a rebellion against the Kate Winslet-led Erudites. That films finale showed our heroes discovering that their enclave of Chicago wasnt actually the last remnant of civilization -- that a battered bruised but resilient world continued on outside the city walls. Chicago we were told was merely an experiment to help ""re-create the humanity that we have lost.""Film Details The Divergent Series Allegiant RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time121 min. More Info Trailer But good fences make good neighbors as Robert Frost once ironically declared and the walls arent coming down quite yet. In Allegiant the third entry the old orders breakdown has plunged Chicago into chaos (which never happens). The citys new leader the formerly factionless guerrilla leader Evelyn (Naomi Watts) who also happens to be Fours mom is preventing anyone from trying to go beyond the walls -- not that it stops Tris Four and a group of their friends who are determined to run leap rappel and fight their way over to the other side.What they find there however is a dystopia of a different sort. After making it through a red ravaged wasteland called the Fringe Tris and the others are led to a massive futuristic base called the Bureau of Genetic Welfare overseen by fatherly bureaucrat David (Daniels). He explains that many years ago humans developed the ability to modify their genes which led to a cataclysmic war. Now the Bureau is trying to undo the damage by trying to breed genetically ""pure"" unmodified individuals. Tris herself is a rare pure creature so shes held in very high regard by David and the others. Four alas is deemed ""damaged"" like the rest and forced to join the ranks of the Bureaus subservient military force. EXPAND Murray Close Youd think humanity would learn the perils of categorizing people like this but no. Allegiants dedication to working every possible variation of the social-hierarchies-are-bad allegory is admirable but there was a straightforwardness to the initial idea that gets lost amid the rapidly accumulating details. We immediately understood the basic factionalism of this world as presented in the first film with its divisions between peaceniks intellectuals jocks etc. But Allegiant confuses and bores with endless scenes of David and others explaining things how the world got to be this way how it is now how it needs to be and so on and so forth. The film at times feels like wall-to-wall exposition -- some of it lies some of it true all of it awkward. David also needs Tris to testify before some sort of Council to whom he answers so that much of the film is building up to...yes more exposition.Thats a real step down from both Divergent and Insurgent which whatever their many flaws at least engaged us with the compelling romance of Tris and Four and in the second film some memorable action. Insurgent in particular alternated between dreamy mindscapes and a welcome physicality enriched by Woodley and Jamess compelling chemistry. The actors still give it their all in Allegiant but theres only so much they can do with such a clunky verbose script. And on the rare occasion that the film actually quiets its characters down and delivers something resembling action its woefully inert.The previous entries relied on hand-to-hand combat and acrobatic stunts to get our pulses going but this time were treated to scenes of people sitting uneasily as they fly around in (hilariously fake-looking) futuristic aircraft and shouting at each other across walls windows and doors. Much of the time theyre yelling more exposition. These movies were never going to transform cinema but watching Allegiant its hard not to feel as if someone has pulled the rug out from under an otherwise modestly entertaining franchise. And a y.a. series that had distinguished itself with both romance and action now finds itself undone by a film that has very little of either.The Divergent Series Allegiant Directed by Robert Schwentke Lions Gate Opens March 18 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Bilge Ebiri Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Theres Ansel Elgorts performance as Caleb Tris clumsy brother. These arent the funniest parts though -- the funniest parts come when Allegiant isnt trying to be. For example Jeff Daniels attempt to let out an angry raw reaction to something not going his characters way registers more as a punchline just waiting for its moment to shine in an Honest Trailer than a plausible show of emotion. Tris acts of rebellion -- ""You know nothing about David"" she at one point shouts at Four (Theo James) -- paint her as a stereotypical teenager rather than the one-of-a-kind badass shes supposed to be. Just because shes special Allegiant seems to say doesnt mean she cant turn into a high school student straight out of Gossip Girl every once in a while. And its fine if she does but that kind of behavior feels hilariously out of place in a movie where mistakes carry much darker consequences than not getting to sit next to Blair Waldorf on the museum steps. Here mistakes could end in death and similarly disastrous repercussions. Allegiant follows Tris and Four as they attempt to find the fix for their fractured Chicago but instead discover destructive secrets guarded by a dangerous villain. The stakes are high and the movie is at its best when that tension envelops scenes. An early escape sequence where Tris once again cements herself as a tough-as-nails heroine is genuinely thrilling and another where Four chases a child through a wrecked village with the help of somewhat confusing technology (multiple drones are involved) is similarly nerve-wracking. These scenes are not subtle -- thats a good thing; no one wants to watch a quiet fight -- but unfortunately neither are the ones forgoing special effects and stunts in favor of dialogue. Toward the end Tris delivers a heavy-handed monologue on the importance of equality that fails to resonate despite Woodleys charming gentle performance as a young woman doing her best to save an entire population. Its a forced injection of topicality that doesnt inspire the powerful effect it wants to -- an apt sentiment for the film as a whole really. Allegiant aches to be a thought-provoking moving allegory of the current world. Instead its an unwieldy two hours too unintentionally silly to validate how seriously it takes itself.

The teen dystopia needs you a heroine who earned our respect. Alas four months after The Hunger Games peaced out were stuck palling around with the The Divergent Series franchises Beatrice aka Tris a grim drip wed happily sacrifice in the Arena. The Hunger Games and Divergent share a premise Their low-born riot grrrls grow up to smash a caste system. For Katniss that was the Districts -- 12 geographically different cities where your environment shaped your personality much like it would if you were raised in Baton Rouge rather than Beverly Hills. Katniss was an ordinary girl with inspiring courage. Her choices won us over hide or fight manipulate or self-sacrifice Peeta or Gale. She wasnt perfect -- boy did she have a sour lonely streak -- but she was human which is a feat itself in a post-apocalyptic world where individual lives are trash. But Tris (Shailene Woodley) is a photocopy that misses the point. In her world a futuristic Chicago that still refers to OHare Airport as if anyone has ever seen a stewardess people have tolerated 200 years of being divided into five personality-based clans Erudite (smart bullies) Amity (nice farmers) Dauntless (brave soldiers) Candor (truthful lawyers?) and Abnegation (other nice people who wear gray for some reason). (Theres no Handyman clan which must be why two centuries after the bombing the city is still who-gives-a-damn rubble.) As a Divergent Tris tested positive for all mystifying the audience as she doesnt have even one personality trait let alone five. Her only talents are getting lame tattoos staring blankly at her boyfriend Four (Theo James) and falling for stupid traps. Plus can you imagine her growing a tomato? (PS For anyone who needs to take their SATs the correct word for combining traits should have been Convergent.) Unlike Katniss Tris is biologically Special a counterproductive plot choice in a movie that thinks its arguing people should be equal. And boneheaded Allegiant the third installment with one more still to go scrambles its message more. Now after Tris has dispatched evil Erudite Jeanine (Kate Winslet) the five factions have blended into one angry mob headed by Fours mom (Naomi Watts) who is determined to execute their former leaders. In keeping with original novelist Veronica Roths habit of naming clans after the most awkward mouthful in the thesaurus lets call them Castigation. As one does when their land is taken over by a tyrant Tris Four and their buddies Christina (Zoe Kravitz) Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Peter (Miles Teller) flee to Canada the outlands a nuclear-blasted wasteland where the blood-red rivers sizzle like bacon. Lionsgate/SummitHere we learn that Tris is even better than Divergent. Shes genetically pure -- the only genetically pure human in Chicago -- a compliment made even creepier when delivered by an Aryan ruler played by Jeff Daniels whos been made up so pale he looks like hes bleached his blonde hair and watered down his blue eyes. Thanks to Triss privileged DNA shes separated from her ""damaged"" (and alas for us more interesting) friends left crammed elbow-to-elbow in dark bunk beds and swooped up into Davids all-white penthouse. Cmon Tris. If you learned anything in the two films it took to defeat Jeanine its never trust anyone who likes modern furniture. With every Divergent sequel the series gets dumber and dumber. At first I thought the plot was misguided like author Roth pawed through a dictionary and picked big words at random. Lets be real The Amity and Abnegation clans are basically the same thing. And if only Candor gets to be truthful does that mean everyone else is lying? In Allegiant David reveals that outsiders forced the people of Chicago into these nonsense groups. OK maybe thats why the clans sounded ridiculous -- people cant actually be divided into personalty castes. But then how were people -- including Tris -- successfully sorted by scientific tests like the one that deemed her Divergent? Whats the caste for Writers Who Make Sense? Can we hire one to redo this script? Even Shailene Woodley seems to have given up on her money-making franchise. She was miscast to start with -- Woodley doesnt have a rebellious bone in her body and her bashful charisma has to creep on you the way it did in The Spectacular Now not be welded onto the script. Her costar Kravitz has the pint-sized dynamism that could have pulled it off but even shed be stuck trying to force chemistry with James who at 31 is old enough to know hes in a horrible series and young enough to worry his friends might see it. Only Teller manages to salvage his scenes with what I can best describe as a smart-ass shield Hes nearly three times younger than Christopher Walken but already knows how survive a disaster with an old actors flair for camp. The first two films made about 600 million none of which was invested in Allegiants special effects. Its obsessed with pixelated goo baths of orange slime that barely dampen Triss hair puffs of orange gas that are supposed to poison our heroes yet somehow never rise above their ankles and -- my favorite -- floating Jell-O pods that transport Tris and friends each unnaturally crouched as though riding an invisible carousel horse. As for the action director Robert Schwentke telegraphs whats about to happen 10 seconds before it does. Were like a time traveler living a blink ahead into the future and able to predict everything not just whos about to get shot but what insult someones going to quip. In one scene no sooner had I scribbled in my notes that Tris was lashing out like a kid than David yelled the exact same thing. Great now Im the oppressor. The Hunger Games expanded its civil rights sci-fi hook into a cynical study of leadership and corruption. Divergent feels like a hasty idea scribbled on construction paper crumpled into a ball and ditched in a mud puddle. Even it cant tell what it wanted to say. Instead its a soggy spit-wad toward the good teen movies that shames the whole genre. Burn it all down Girl on Fire. Burn it all down.

Diligent Divergent readers probably know Veronica Roths third book was hardly good enough for one movie. So the screenwriters actually invent stuff of their own.

She hangs out in Dystopian Chicago where evil leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) has been replaced by evil Evelyn (Naomie Watts). Evelyns plans for domination send Tris over the wall along with her hunky love Four (Theo James) her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) her friend Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and Peter so cleverly played by Miles Teller that we dont know whos side hes on. However I should remind you that Evelyn is Fours mother and that a new villain pops up in the form of commander David (Jeff Daniels) whos a honcho at the Bureau of Genetic Welfare located on the grounds of Chicagos former OHare Airport. Intrigued? Dont be. You thought maybe the old caste cast system that divided the city into five factions (Erudite Abnegation Candor Dauntless Amity) died with Jeanine. Jokes on you. Davids got his own system which basically turns his new plan into the same old plan we had before with worse screenwriting lousier acting tortoise-pacing and way cheesier computer effects. Director Robert Schwentke and his trio of writers havent given us a single reason to hang around for the last installment due out next year and laughably called Ascendant -- ironic considering the only place the misbegotten series is going is down down down.

JULIA COOPER Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 18 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 18 2016 251PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Robert Schwentke Written by Noah Oppenheim Adam Cooper and Bill Collage Starring Shailene Woodley Theo James and Naomi Watt Classification PG Country USA Language English Lets say that a critic is a person whose interest can help to activate the interest of others"" writes film critic A.O. Scott in his new book Better Living Through Criticism. That sounds about right and yet a more blunt truth is that the film critic sees the movies you wont want to. The latest case in point is The Divergent Series Allegiant. Try as I might I cannot activate your interest in this bloated excuse for a movie. Knight of Cups follows the life of self-loathing Hollywood writer Rick (Christian Bale) as he wanders in and out of jobs and relationships. REVIEW Knight of Cups Were we only in love with the rarity of Terrence Malick? Chi-Raq starring Teyonah Parris is a musical satire about gun violence in Chicagos south side. review Chi-Raq Musical satire about gun violence falls short of its ambition REVIEW Coconut Hero Teen tale of depression and family is fine but nothing new That may be because my own interest was in no way shape or form activated by director Robert Schwentkes cloying parable of heroism at the end of the world. Schwentke has now directed back-to-back Divergent movies after taking over the directors seat from Neil Burger who helmed the first instalment (maybe needing some time to reflect on his sins Schwentke has opted out of the next and final film in the series Ascendant which will be directed by Lee Toland Krieger).The dystopian Allegiant was written by Noah Oppenheim Adam Cooper and Bill Collage and is based on the young adult book series of the same name by Veronica Roth. It stars Shailene Woodley (The Descendants The Fault in Our Stars) who reprises her role as doe-eyed heroine Beatrice (Tris) Prior and her bae Tobias (Four) Eaton (Theo James). The film opens with the two lovers scaling the crumbling remains of a skyscraper. They look out over what was once the city of Chicago and the large wall that now traps them within it. Following the uprisings of previous Divergent movies the city is fractious and drunk on a mob mentality.Together with pals Christine (Zoe Kravitz) Peter (Miles Teller) Tori (Maggie Q) and Triss brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) the squad breaches the wall and discovers another city far more advanced and futuristic than their shabby and soon-to-be-rioting Chicago. There they meet the leader David who is played by a stiff and dad-like Jeff Daniels.In its envisioning of a technically superior and integrated future the movie desperately wants a sleek and goth-inspired aesthetic in the spirit of Rick Owens. What it ends up with is more of an unfortunate Anne Klein-meets-The Jetsons reality.Dystopia as a genre is about critiquing the faults of humankind and considering what went wrong where. Sorry teens but thats not found here. The obvious parallel of the Divergent series is to that other young-adult novel-based dystopia franchise The Hunger Games. And yet The Hunger Games is interesting. Whereas Jennifer Lawrence and her revolutionary comrades are mostly successful in mounting a critique of capitalism and class struggle Allegiant offers insight into nothing. (Lets be honest Hunger Games aside how successful could a top-grossing franchise ever really be at depicting the disenfranchised?)Well thats not exactly right Allegiant does offer insight into its protagonists apple-pie humanism. The clunky moral of this story is that its high time that everyone start accepting each other. Triss kumbaya philosophy is trite at best. At worst its offensive. Thats because throughout Allegiant there are myriad images of and allegories to Nazi Germany that are so unsubtle and so devoid of nuance that Triss call for everyone to ""all get along"" is not only insipid and naive - its also ethically irresponsible. Gassing child abduction and cultural genocide are not tropes they have a real and not-so-distant history that shouldnt be thrown around aimlessly for the sake of a middling franchise.Teens deserve more.

Joy.After spending the first two films inside the crumbling ruins of Chicago Triss (Shailene Woodley) and her gang (including Theo James Four Ansel Elgorts Caleb and Miles Tellers snarky backstabbing Peter) venture beyond the Donald Trump-style wall that encloses the city. (Its worth noting that in the films vision of future Chicago the only building that remains preserved is the one currently bearing Trumps name.)Once outside Triss meets up with David (Jeff Daniels new to the series) the leader of something called the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. He seems like a decent dude until its revealed he plans to erase the memories of everyone using an orange dust that looks like residue from the bottom of a Cheetos bag. Oh no""Allegiant"" suffers badly from third-part-in-a-series syndrome; it doesnt work as a standalone film since theres no beginning (this movie could seriously use a ""previously on Divergent"" refresher) and a false cliffhanger ending. Meanwhile a centerpiece speech on individuality sounds like something from an elementary school commencement address.With this hapless entry even fans of the series will have their allegiance tested.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaThe Divergent Series AllegiantGRADE DRated PG-13 for intense violence and action thematic elements and some partial nudityRunning time 121 minutes 17 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1prQ8zH MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/03/18/movie-review-divergent-series-allegiant-sinks-hapless-new-entry/81952464/,200,divergent8,divergent,detroitnews
"Review Confusing plot in latest Divergent installment may require strong fan allegiance to Allegiant - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The confusing latest Divergent installment Allegiant is strictly for devoted fans The Divergent Daniel McFadden Four (Theo James) and Tris (Shailene Woodley) in ""The Divergent Series Allegiant."" Four (Theo James) and Tris (Shailene Woodley) in ""The Divergent Series Allegiant."" (Daniel McFadden) Kenneth Turan ""Allegiant"" is the kind of movie where when a character says ""Were gonna be OK"" you know her troubles are just beginning. Especially if that characters name happens to be Tris Prior.As sturdily played by Shailene Woodley in two previous films with one more yet to come Tris is a young woman whos had a lot to contend with as the heroine of the ""Divergent"" series of adaptations of Veronica Roths mega-selling young adult novels. See more of Entertainments top stories on Facebook gt;gt;These books have such a devoted audience that the final book in the series like ""Harry Potter"" and ""Hunger Games"" before it has been split into two films. This first part is mildly diverting unsophisticated fare that takes liberties with the original novel yet still stumbles on confusing exposition that doesnt really make complete sense even when its taken from the book. Insurgent smartly gives the Divergent Tris room to run Kenneth Turan When superhero franchises falter studios often reboot them starting over from a different perspective with a different cast. Whats happened with ""The Divergent Series Insurgent"" is less drastic but similar A successful series has kept its cast but been revamped in the middle of its run. That... When superhero franchises falter studios often reboot them starting over from a different perspective with a different cast. Whats happened with ""The Divergent Series Insurgent"" is less drastic but similar A successful series has kept its cast but been revamped in the middle of its run. That... (Kenneth Turan) When last we left the intrepid Tris at the close of the previous ""Insurgent"" evil Janine had been vanquished and the citizens of the futuristic ruin that was once the great city of Chicago are headed for the wall that encircles them and keeps them from whatever is on the other side.Not so fast says director Robert Schwentke whos returned from that last effort. Before showing us whats on the other side of the wall he and a brand-new trio of screenwriters (Noah Oppenheim and Adam Cooper amp; Bill Collage) take a little time to reveal how bad things have gotten even after Janines death.For starters de facto new ruler Evelyn (Naomi Watts) undaunted by rival Johanna (Octavia Spencer) is putting on the equivalent of Stalinist show trials before a blood-thirsty mob angry about an old regime that divided everyone into factions. ""Youve incited a mob. Good luck controlling them"" says her son Four (Theo James) who does double duty as Tris beau in a good example of the films comic-book dialogue. (Evelyns response ""Im doing this for you"" is just as feeble.)Fed up with all these bad vibes Four Tris Tris brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) her gal-pal Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and all-around slimeball Peter (Miles Teller) manage to get over the wall and confront whats on the other side.Initially its not a pretty picture but rather an enormous toxic waste dump area unappetizingly called ""The Fringe."" But then our heroes run into some slickly dressed types who announce kind of like an old ad for G.E. ""Welcome to the future. Weve been waiting for you.""The future turns out to be an ultramodern citadel called the Bureau of Genetic Welfare established in what used to be Chicagos OHare Airport and run by the unctuous David (an underutilized Jeff Daniels). Tris may think shes safe here but we know better. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link The tale that David tells her about the origins of the old faction-dominated system back home in Chicago a perplexing saga involving wars caused by genetic modification an experiment that has lasted 200 years and the difference between pure and damaged genes is far-fetched even by the standards of the genre not to mention confusing.No matter because the high school-style emotions that are the storys underpinnings are never far from sight. Tris for reasons that are unclear spends more and more time with David causing Four to feel peeved. Will attractive Bureau resident Nita (Nadia Hilker) catch his eye? Stay tuned.As directed by Schwentke who did the more involving ""Insurgent"" but wont be returning for the final film ""Allegiant"" has its share of brisk action and high-tech gizmos like drones that obey finger commands.But because the series plot reveal turns out to be more confusing than compelling and because turning a novel into two films invariably leads to inflated productions only the most devoted fans of the book will pledge allegiance to whats on the screen.------------The Divergent Series AllegiantMPAA rating PG-13 for intense violence and action thematic elements and some partial nudityRunning time 2 hoursPlaying In general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Robert Schwentke Octavia Spencer Ansel Elgort Theo James Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-allegiant-review-20160318-column.html#nt=oft03a-1la1,200,divergent9,divergent,latimes

So our heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her compatriots decide its time to head out of town for some self-discovery and surprising(?) revelations about The World They Thought They Knew. Also some halfhearted discussions about what makes us what we are. Theres a lot of standing and talking a lot of clothes-wearing (and even some doffing) and a lot of very loving set design. What there isnt is tension. Or feeling. With Jeff Daniels Miles Teller Theo James.

Murray Close/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Murray Close/Lionsgate From left to right Christina (Zoe Kravitz) Tris (Shailene Woodley) Four (Theo James) Caleb (Ansel Elgort) Tori (Maggie Q) and Peter (Miles Teller) in The Divergent Series Allegiant. Murray Close/Lionsgate Creatively speaking if not financially the Divergent series is less a franchise than a quagmire an unwinnable war that nonetheless must be fought until the bitter end. And like all quagmires the terrain has been hostile from the start Based on Veronica Roths bestselling novels the films have tried to advance a ""Chosen One"" narrative through the awkward rigging of a dystopian ""faction"" system that at best only makes sense when vast swaths of the screenplay are carved out to explain it. Three-quarters of Insurgent the most recent entry were devoted to opening a mystery box from ""The Founders""; the last quarter asked the audience to sort through the tortured logic of its contents. Based on the first half of the last book in the trilogy -- which has been cleaved in the lucrative style of YA finales like Harry Potter Twilight and The Hunger Games -- Allegiant is substantially more exciting than Insurgent if only for clearing up the confusion a bit. And all it takes to explain it is an audio recap in the opening title sequence two or three holographic video presentations a 10-minute Jeff Daniels monologue and a meeting with a special elite counsel. Thats relatively efficient work for this series but it brings the world of Divergent no closer to allegorical significance other than a blanket condemnation of baffling totalitarian governments. When we left off an uprising hastened the collapse of the faction system in Chicago with ""factionless"" leader Evelyn (Naomi Watts) capping Janine (Kate Winslet) the dictator hell-bent on supporting it. In a classic ""meet the new boss"" scenario Evelyn starts ordering public executions of Janines loyalists and shuts down access to the wall despite the mystery box offering the promise of a civilization on the other side. But that doesnt stop Divergent hero Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) and her friends--love interest Four (Theo James) weak brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) Dauntless comrade Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and the duplicitous Peter (Miles Teller)--from following their curiosity and busting out anyway. What they find is somehow bleaker than the ruins of Chicago an arid red hellscape that looks like Mad Max Fury Road restaged on the surface of Mars. But soon enough theyre picked up by high-tech soldiers and whisked to a pocket of humanity that resides in that most dystopian environment of all -- Chicago OHare International Airport. Once there Tris status as the only ""100% pure"" specimen from Chicago makes her the key figure in an initiative to restore humanity after a genetic experiment gone awry. Shell just have to trust the director of this initiative David (Daniels) the latest in a long line of shifty authoritarian figures in the Divergent series. The mythology gets more complicated still on all fronts from the ins-and-outs of genetic engineering to the civil war that breaks out in Chicago between Evelyns government and former Amity leader Johanna (Octavia Spencer). In typical Divergent fashion all of this intrigue requires long-winded explanation which inevitably stalls the action. But compared to the endless wheel-spinning in Insurgent Allegiant keeps the action set pieces coming at a regular clip and ventures into unknown territories where the effects render worlds that are both sleekly futuristic and ravaged by the sins of the past. Of the cast only Teller appears to be having any fun jesting his way through world-changing crises like a Jeff Goldblum character. The rest of Allegiant like its predecessors is handled with deadly seriousness which has never served a science-fiction universe that doesnt hold up under scrutiny. Allegiant may tidy up the ornate logic of the Divergent series but a clearer understanding of the faction system and its roots is not necessarily a more compelling one. Unlike the Panem of The Hunger Games saga which takes real historical tyrannies as an inspiration theres no getting around the fact that Divergent is a clunky apparatus built around a trendy ""Chosen One"" type. Its now possible after Allegiant not to be confused anymore about how that apparatus works. To be entertained by it is another matter.

Thats one of the takeaways from The Divergent Series Allegiant - Part 1 the worn and weathered third installment in the four-part film adaptation of Veronica Roths postapocalyptic dystopian YA books. The heroine here in case youre still getting things muddled with The Hunger Games is Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior (Shailene Woodley) the plucky teen who is the ""divergent"" - she doesnt fit neatly into any one of the factions that the powers-that-be established to make society a seemingly utopian place. Instead Tris exhibits a nonconforming combo of traits and skills that makes her 1) a threat to the ruling order 2) the hope for humankind and 3) a magnet for Tobias ""Four"" Eaton the hunky hero played by Theo James. Near the beginning of Allegiant he and Tris can be found scaling the distressed exterior of a Chicago skyscraper (I guess the stairs have been destroyed) to take in the view and steal a kiss and catch their breath before spending the next 90 minutes dodging gun blasts and bad dialogue. A spoiler if you missed The Divergent Series Insurgent but Kate Winslets Jeanine Matthews who lorded over the factions with a steely gaze and a tight-fitting business suit is dead now replaced by the rebel leader Evelyn who also happens to be Fours mom. Evelyn is played by Naomi Watts looking as tough as she can as she lines up traitors and declares ""Let the trials begin - justice will be done"" Jeff Daniels appears in Allegiant too as David head of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. Hes a smooth operator befriending Tris when she and Four arrive at his spiffy campus far removed from the rubble of Chicago. Tris may be the only person in the room - in the universe actually - who doesnt suspect that David may be up to no good. Finally on the run as Allegiants running time winds down she apologizes to Four ""I never should have trusted him."" Theres much exposition to dispense with in order to set up the climactic Allegiant (Part 2) slated for release June 9 2017. Director Robert Schwentke and his writing team do their best to move things along. Actually who knows if its their best? Maybe theyre suffering from Divergent fatigue along with the rest of us. sreaphillynews.com 215-854-5629 Steven_Rea The Divergent Series Allegiant - Part 1Directed by Robert Schwentke.

The Divergent Series Allegiant is merely future schlock review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Divergent Series Allegiant is merely future schlock review The dystopian future schlock of Allegiant is so relentlessly dull and meaningless this entire movie could be removed from The Divergent Series and few would be the wiser.Shailene Woodley and Andy Bean in The Divergent Series Allegiant.  (Murray Close / Lionsgate)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 17 2016The Divergent Series AllegiantStarring Shailene Woodley Theo James Miles Teller Zoe Kravitz Ansel Elgort and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Robert Schwentke. Opens March 18 at GTA theatres. 120 minutes. PGIn the future everybody will be famous for 15 minutes -- and bored out of their skulls.Apologies to Andy Warhol and to anyone who suffers through Allegiant the third and most useless chapter of the continuing sci-fi bloatfest called The Divergent Series.Article Continued BelowThis dystopian future schlock has become so relentlessly dull and meaningless this entire movie could be removed from the series and few would be the wiser. As is standard operating procedure now for young adult book-to-film franchises the finale of the saga is split into two parts maximizing the profits while minimizing the art -- along with the onscreen intensity of lead star ShaileneWoodley.Allegiant coming after Insurgent plays like one of those stand-alone episodes on The X-Files as an inconsequential detour from the main narrative. Thats sometimes a trip worth taking but not here. The talky and CG-heavy proceedings once again directed by Robert Schwentke labour with forehead-slapping and yawn-worthy solemnity to debate the pros and cons of eugenics and social engineering.Things at least get off to a rousing start with our hero Tris (Woodley) her boy-toy Four (Theo James) and other brave renegades scaling the Floydian fascism of walled Chicago to strike out for unknown freedom while being pursued by murderous enforcers.The rebels discover to their dismay red acid rain falling mainly on an arid plane but soon theyre taken in by the benevolent toilers for the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. Its a blandly efficient organization located in the ruins of Chicagos OHare Airport the worlds most inevitable stopover shaded in the most boring hues of industrial blues and greys.While bureau chief David (a smarmy Jeff Daniels) distracts Tris with obviously slanted yadda-yadda about Whats Really Going On (seems all those Chicago factions are a giant science fair) others in the group struggle to put genuine kinetic energy into this supposed action pic.Tris BFF Christina (Zoe Kravitz) her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) her scheming fellow traveller Peter (Miles Teller the only actor having fun) and her broody lover Four get up to various hijinks in a bootless attempt to make something of this story talk shoot scowl repeat. Meanwhile back in Chicago the main course of hostilities between the armies of Factionless bully Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and Amity hippie Johanna (Octavia Spencer) gets put under a metaphoric heat lamp waiting to be tepidly served in the final chapter Ascendant due next year.Its not urgent Divergent I can wait.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

There were so many holes in the storyline plus inconsistencies -- both from author Veronica Roths original underlying material and from where we left off in the last film -- that I was both confused and deeply disappointed by this very unsatisfying movie. Fans will recall that at the end of last years ""Insurgent"" we witnessed Evelyn (Naomi Watts) the leader of the ""factionless"" citizens executing the cruel dictator of Chicago Janine (Kate Winslet) -- with the suddenly ""freed"" Chicagoans running toward the ominous wall that had imprisoned them for a couple of centuries. But at the very beginning of ""Allegiant"" the wall is still in place -- highly electrified against all who would breach it -- with new dictator Evelyn and her minions doing all they can to prevent the Chicago denizens from venturing out into the forbidding landscape. The look of the land beyond the wall is completely different that what weve glimpsed -- if only fleetingly -- in the previous films. As the quintet of Tris (Shailene Woodley) Four (Theo James) Caleb (Ansel Elgort) Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and Peter (Miles Teller) make it over the wall they confront a Martian-like scorched-earth landscape clearly the remains of some kind of worldwide nuclear disaster or war. From there things progressively get more confusing and often very silly. We quickly discover there is a super-colony of humans who have been treating Chicago as a biological and psychological laboratory for all this time. Via very sophisticated spying mechanisms the ""damaged"" people in Chicago -- long divided into the now-discarded factions -- have been constantly observed by those living in the seemingly idyllic hidden community run by the mysterious Bureau led by the equally mysterious David (Jeff Daniels). The problem at this point in this ongoing journey of the ""Divergent"" saga is that we increasingly have become less and less interested in the protagonists including the two key ones Tris and Theo. The two lovers become briefly estranged as Tris initially believes David and his plan are the true way to a more utopian future while Theo smells a rat. Yet all of this is quite unengaging and the film devolves into a mish-mash of people running around chasing each other -- but to what ultimate end? Hopefully things will be brought together far better in the fourth and final ""Ascendant"" film being released next year -- based on the second half of Roths third book in her ""Divergent"" trilogy. The principal actors and actresses do their level best to deliver solid performances as they wallow in the mediocre script they were forced to follow but its not enough to lift this disappointing film to the heights we were hoping it would achieve. The special effects are among the more positive aspects of ""Allegiant"" but those alone cannot rescue this highly flawed sequel.  Summit Entertainment presents a film directed by Robert Schwentke and written by Noah Oppenheim Adam Cooper Bill Collage and Stephen Chbosky based on the novel ""Allegiant"" by Veronica Roth. Running time 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for intense violence and action thematic elements and some partial nudity). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Despite all the brawling shooting and kissing that goes on these films are entirely bloodless.[Movie review Miracles even works for those of little faith] Jennifer Lawrence carries ""The Hunger Games"" series with a throaty raw intensity of performance and even ""The Maze Runner"" films have a zip of sweaty adrenaline going for them but ""Divergent"" ""Insurgent"" and now ""Allegiant"" are a trio of interestingly designed snoozes. It could be the casting - as tough but sweet Tris Woodley just doesnt have the ferocity of Lawrence but then again no one does. Theres no love triangle tension and Tris and Four (James) remain as deeply committed and in love as ever their devotion unwavering.[Movie review The Bronze has the tinny sound of a dud] The real culprit is the plotting which is at once overly complicated (something about genetically modified humans starting a nuclear civil war 200 years ago then they did an experiment to un-genetically modify them but theres a civil war there now and Jeff Daniels is going to lose his funding if Tris doesnt go with his plan and also theyre stealing kids from a tent city using amnesia gas) and overly simple (it all comes down to pushing a button).[Movie review Embrace of the Serpent depicts life in the Amazon] Directed by Robert Schwentke who also helmed ""Insurgent"" theres more of a fixation on the whiz-bang technology than there is on the story. Perhaps because theres not much there despite all the mumbo jumbo details. The young protagonists get out of the walled in territory realize that things are lame out there too then go back. But ooh look Personal drones and memory tabs and floating plasma blobs and surveillance pods. NeatThe tech allows the filmmakers to skirt storytelling restrictions that the film would otherwise face and which might actually inject some suspense into the proceedings. Ultimately if theres one thing that post-apocalyptic young adult films reassure us of its that teens are societys cockroaches - they can survive anything. Their raging hormones recklessness and wise-guy quips will withstand any nuclear fall out. But more than anything the teen war on rules will never die and ""Allegiant"" testifies to that.

Comments click to enlarge The Divergent Series Allegiant Video Rated PG-13  121 minutes  2016 This penultimate installment in the dour dystopian franchise offers stronger visual effects and more thought-provoking biopunk notions about genetic engineering than the two previous films but even star Shailene Woodley looks bored. In a thinning plot that will somehow be extended into a fourth and final cash grab in 2017 the heroine her hunky lover (Theo James) her brother (Ansel Elgort) and their friends (Zoe Kravitz Miles Teller) escape an embattled Chicago and discover an ultramodern compound--formerly OHare International Airport--where genetically unaltered (or ""pure"") individuals observe the genetically altered (or ""damaged"") as part of an incubated experiment. Jeff Daniels is a bracing addition as the ""genetic welfare"" bureaucrat obsessed with the heroines miraculous purity and the script raises some intriguing questions (whether harmony can be achieved without struggle whether divided nations are more peaceful). But cautionary tales about eugenics have been told better in literature (Brave New World) and on film (Gattaca) which leaves Woodley and company to repeat some pretty tired tropes.

So when the movie series goes the-way-of-all-franchises (Twilight Harry Potter The Hunger Games) and splits the final instalment of its source material in half thats an awful lot of stretching. And then after that stretch to stretch each movie to nearly two-and-a-half hours? What can you do but pull a muscle? Allegiant (the half of the book that will be followed by a movie with an all-new adjective Ascendant) fills its time with a whole new world. And special effects therein. And fighting. To update Having overturned the social order in Insurgent (and having therein lost the best actor in the series Kate Winslet as the villainous Jeanine) Katniss - uh I mean Tris (Shailene Woodley) is having second thoughts about what shes done. Seems the previously-downtrodden factions in post-apocalyptic Chicago like Amity Abnegation and Candor have taken to summary ""trials"" and executions of the Erudite followers of Jeanine. (Stay with me here). So despite her Erudite brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) having tried to kill her she has him freed by her boyfriend Four (Theo James) and they and her frenemy Peter (Miles Teller) and fellow Dauntless Christina (Zoe Kravitz) set out to find the forbidden world beyond Chicago. What they find is The Bureau a super-techy domed city that keeps tabs on Chicago and is run by the mysterious smooth-talking David (Jeff Daniels) whose demeanor practically screams ""Ive got ulterior motives"" Its not much of a spoiler to say that from Insurgent to Allegiant our gang has simply gone from one kind of sinister dystopia to another. But the new backdrop does allow director Robert Schwentke (whos being replaced by Lee Toland Krieger for the finale) to play with toys that would have been previously been out of place in the series. There are glass-bubble flying machines and hovering drones that can be controlled with a wave of a hand and which automatically place force-shields in front of our heroes. If you havent reached the point where noisy green-screen battles make your eyes droop enjoy - because by necessity there are a lot of them in Allegiant. As always the narrative mostly goes fight save Tris Four and Tris kiss. Repeat. But the underlying theme of the series itself becomes confused by the third novel/movie. Divergent was easy to understand with its strict social constructs based on physical and personal characteristics. It was high school writ large (and no accident that Roth started writing it in college). In the course of the movies being ""different"" or divergent has gone from being a bad thing in the first movie to a good thing in the second (when the message from the Founders was unearthed) to sort of a bad thing again now that bad people consider it good. Im not sure. Is Tris a true individual or is she just part of a clique she didnt even know existed? At the risk of being a pedant I remain resistant toward Divergent and its attendants. And Allegiant is the least of these.

Credit Lionsgate 1.5 stars (out of 4)Its deep deep deep deep into the future and Armageddon has arrived. A small population later emerges from the ashes and manages to salvage artifacts from human history. This movie better not represent what 21st century cinema had to offer. Shailene Woodleys Most Bizarre Quotes Plodding ludicrous and at times undecipherable this post-apocalyptic drama -- the third film of the Divergent series -- is a disaster in every sense of the word. No chance it will entice newbies while even the franchises most ardent fans will likely find it a half-baked slog. (That is when theyre not bellyaching over its wild veering from novelist Veronica Roths source material.)Anyway where were we? Oh right. Dystopian Chicago. Thanks to Divergent/Rebel With a Cause/Chosen One/Super-Special Girl Tris (Shailene Woodley) the mandated five factions (Erudite Abnegation Candor Dauntless Amity) within the city are now dissolved. The government has been overthrown. Evil Jeanine (Kate Winslet) is deader than President Snow. But the civilization remains at an unrest as new leader Evelyn (Naomi Watts) sets out to kill everyone associated with the powerful Erudite faction. Shailene Woodleys Red Carpet Style Through the Years Tris and her love Four (Theo James) want none of that. So along with her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) smarmy sometimes-foe Peter (lone bright spot Miles Teller) and friend Christina (Zoe Kravitz) they scale the wall that surrounds Chicago to explore the other side. Theyre soon rescued and escorted to a shiny pointy headquarters. ""Were gonna be OK"" Tris assures Four en route. This proclamation can only mean two things 1. They are most certainly not OK. 2. Act 1 is finally over. One down two to go. The group turns up at the Bureau of Genetic Welfare (formerly Chicagos OHare Airport) where commander David (Jeff Daniels) wades through even more exposition. It turns out the faction project is merely a giant experiment under constant surveillance. But there are now obvious cracks in the system. Tris is ""pure"" and everyone else is ""damaged"" so David seeks her help in purifying the population. Maybe. The message is muddled though its no spoiler to reveal that his true plan is significantly more nefarious. Young Hollywoods Hottest Stars The plotting might have been crafted in a celluloid YA postapocalyptic laboratory. Here youll find the small antiestablishment movement taking action (The Hunger Games) star-crossed love story (Hunger Games again) a curious grand case study (The Maze Runner) and because why not a defiant journey across a desert landscape (Mad Max Fury Road). Only this flick is the low-rent version of all of the above. And a nonstop barrage of explosions and CGIed special effects cant mask its very real problems.Woodley still lacks the acting gravitas to lead a revolution. It doesnt matter that she chopped the ponytail and added highlights to her hair; shes just not credible in the role. Her Tris has gone from kick-ass heroine to gullible bore and her ability to suddenly develop the skills to pilot a state-of-the-art aircraft late in the game is laughable. Costars Reunited Meanwhile she and brooding-to-a-fault James continue to flail at pretending theyre in love with each other. (How peculiar that two of Woodleys most indelible onscreen loves Teller and Elgort appear in this franchise). Yet perhaps its not fair for young Woodley to shoulder the blame. After all respected thespians Watts Daniels and Octavia Spencer phone it in onscreen while presumably collecting sizable paychecks off it.Lets be Candor This franchise is tumbling downhill at an alarming speed. The first outing 2014s Divergent was a genuinely cool and wily kick-starter. But each subsequent installment has failed miserably. (Lest we forget last years Insurgent sequel revolved around Tris ability to open a box). Celebrities And Their Stunt Doubles Splitting a book in two didnt work for a top-tier project like The Hunger Games Mockingjay and comes off like even more of a tedious desperate money grab here. Theres still one more chapter to go -- and how fitting that the last line of this film is a loud emphatic ""No""Cant get enough of Us?

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan March 17 Shailene Woodley returns as the heroine Tris in ""The Divergent Series Allegiant"" where she encounters Romit (Andy Bean) and the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) For any newbie considering just sauntering into ""Allegiant"" the third installment in the series of films inspired by novelist Veronica Roths ""Divergent"" trilogy I wouldnt recommend it without a quick primer. Heck even if youve read all three books -- set in a dystopian Chicago where society has been regimented into five ""factions"" based on the personality traits bravery honesty intelligence selflessness and friendliness -- it will be hard to keep up with the new film which pays scant attention to what has come before while barreling madly forward through a saga that grows more complicated as it draws toward its fervently-to-be-wished-for conclusion. If you lament the recent cinematic trend of splitting the final book in a series into two movies (see ""Harry Potter"" ""The Hunger Games"" etc.) youll be dismayed to learn that theyve done it again here Although ""Allegiant"" bears the title of Roths final book it is only the first of two films to be adapted from that 2013 publication. Lionsgate Films wont wrap things up until next summer when ""Ascendant"" comes out. After the earth-shattering revelations of ""Insurgent"" Tris (Shailene Woodley) must escape with Four (Theo James) and go beyond the wall enclosing Chicago. (  / Lionsgate) In the meantime if youd rather not rent ""Insurgent"" to refresh your memory about prior developments heres where we are in the story As ""Allegiant"" opens the faction system has collapsed with the assassination of the despotic ruler Jeanine (Kate Winslet) in an uprising led by heroes Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her boyfriend Four (Theo James) whose ""divergence"" from the prescribed cardboard caricatures of their compatriots lends the series its title. Unfortunately the vacuum created by Jeanines death has been filled by a leader almost as bad Fours ""factionless"" mother Evelyn (Naomi Watts) who in short order starts a civil war with the remnants of the faction system now known as the Allegiant. The Allegiant are led by Johanna (Octavia Spencer) a former Amity honcho who was once a member of Candor (I think). Martial law is the order of the day with a lockdown on the fortified wall surrounding Chicago despite the fact that when we last left Tris she had received a mysterious message left in a time capsule by her pre-apocalyptic forebears telling her to seek her fortunes elsewhere (that is in the wasteland outside the wall). Got it? Good luck. Like Tris youll be on your own from here on in. Though she escapes from Chicago with a passel of her pals from the previous films (Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Zoe Kravitz and Maggie Q) Tris is quickly separated from them when she is taken under the wing of the director (Jeff Daniels) of something called the Bureau of Genetic Welfare an Edenic compound at what used to be OHare International Airport including a program of eugenics that has separated people into GMO and non-GMO varieties like a cross between Nazism and Whole Foods. Its enough to make your head explode. Miles Teller returns as Peter whose character has been flip-flopping between villainy and heroism since the first movie. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) And thats the short version. Well leave out the Fringe the no mans land between Chicago and OHare through which Tris and company pass on their way to the Bureau. ""This hole looks radioactive"" says Triss brother (Elgort) apropos of nothing in an example of the screenplays simple-minded dialogue. Otherwise everything is needlessly tangled and bewildering. A scene in the book in which Tris reads her late mothers journals is recreated here with ""memory tabs"" via a virtual-reality headset that like magical earbuds allows Tris to witness her moms life as a kid. The bells and whistles are simply too much too often and detract from our connection to the characters. Thats a shame because there are some fine actors here although Teller -- whose character has been flip-flopping between villainy and heroism since the first movie -- is the only performer who is really let off the leash. Director Robert Schwentke (who also helmed the last film but will hand the reins of ""Ascendant"" to Lee Toland Krieger) has his hands full babysitting for a demanding overly busy plot. Nuance subtlety feeling -- anything that might help an audience relate to what is happening rather than passively experience it like a roller coaster -- apparently are luxuries this movie could not afford. As a whole the ""Divergent"" series which shamelessly invites comparison to ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Maze Runner"" franchises feels like something weve all seen too many times before. A far more apt title for the cluttered repetitive ""Allegiant"" might have been ""Extravagant"" -- or better yet ""Redundant."" PG-13. At area theaters.

So here we are with ""The Divergent Series Allegiant"" from the thin-to-begin-with Veronica Roth trilogy set in post-apocalyptic dystopian rathole Chicago about the teen savior Tris her fella Four the horrible pukey future the cliques the insurrection the running the regrouping the electrified wall the wondering what lies beyond. Its a pretty dull picture I must say because its my duty to say it. And its a pretty dull picture I must say because something about its particular grade of dullness may cause memory loss.Tris is once again portrayed by Shailene Woodley; Theo James has perfected his sullen glower along with his glowering sull as Four who is so much more than a number to Tris. Kate Winslets evil tyrant got killed in the last one so now we have Fours mom played once again by Naomi Watts running the insurrection but badly; shes prone to hasty executions; she needs to rethink her approach. Jeff Daniels portrays the newest reassuring/weaselly authority figure who runs the Bureau of Genetic Welfare in the building formerly known as OHare airport. Seriously its set in what used to be OHare and seriously it doesnt look much worse in ""Allegiant"" than Ive seen OHare look in the wee hours. Director Robert Schwentke manages one solid action scene involving wall-scaling and rappelling. The rest of the time were either stuck in a reddish toxic ooze signifying various EPA violations or else were in Providence where all is clean and shiny and very ""Logans Run""-ny. Woodleys starting to look a mite bored with this assignment and comes off peevishly. The only wild card remains Miles Teller stuck in supporting-underminer duty but extracting a laugh or two simply by turning his boredom with the material into sly commentary conducted in the margins.

Photo Murray Close AP Allegiant Part 1 another not-bad Insurgent installment 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Of all the big silly action series out there the ""Divergent"" series is the least obnoxious. Its a collection of dumb ideas with acting and direction that is so earnest and naive that the movies become funny when they dont mean to be. But the installments are generous in terms of story -- stuff keeps happening -- and theres none of the stretched-out sense you get from the ""Hunger Games"" series. These stories move. The latest -- hows this for a title ""The Divergent Series Allegiant -- Part 1"" -- combines the usual dumb ideas with one good one. And not just good but impressive in that it makes sense of much of what went before. For those just tuning in this third installment takes place in a postapocalyptic Chicago in which people have been divided into communities based on personality type. Peace-loving folk live in the Amity section. Strong fearless people reside in the Dauntless part of town. Intellectuals find a home in the Erudite community. Honest people hang with the Candor crowd. And selfless service-oriented individuals practice their doormat ways in the Abnegation sector. The entire setup of this world based on the novels by Veronica Roth has seemed absurd more a metaphor for high school socializing than any kind of model for a peaceful world. But now we find out the truth and its genuinely interesting The apocalypse came about through genetic engineering. By using the genome to emphasize various desirable character traits scientists created a world of people out of psychological balance. The end product was a devastating war. In Chicago theyre living with the aftermath. Its just too bad they dont all have Chicago accents. It would have been great if that were the one thing that absolutely could not be eradicated. Precisely how this new information fits in with the rest of the story is for audiences to discover. Suffice it to say that the central character Tris (Shailene Woodley) along with her brooding boyfriend Four (Theo James) and a small band of friends make it through the city walls this time and they discover a reality far different from the one theyve been living. The first hour of ""Allegiant"" is nicely plotted. It moves when it should and whenever it lingers its to lavish time on something worth considering. In one scene Tris has to get decontaminated after exposure to radioactivity. She goes into a chamber where she strips down and her clothes are incinerated. Immediately the mind goes to the Nazi death camps and we have to wonder if she will get out of there alive. Except in the highly visual or action sequences Robert Schwentkes direction has a peculiar quality in which you can almost hear him yelling ""Action"" and ""Cut."" What I mean by this is that when people are moving within a frame they often seem less like bodies caught in the midst of motion and more like actors whove just started to move on command. This is a weird criticism but if you see the movie you will notice this. That combined with lines such as this (from an interrogation scene) --""There is no doubt you helped Jeanine take over Chicago"" -- gives the series the air of some billion-dollar episode of ""Amateur Hour."" In the second half of ""Allegiant"" the generous plotting begins to seem random as though it were being made up on the spot. However as has been fortunately the case in every installment in the series the story doesnt trail off or stop midway. The movie ends with a feeling of arrival and completion. Jeff Daniels acting just like Jeff Daniels but in another century appears as a futuristic mastermind and for most of the movie Tris and Four are trying to decide if hes a good futuristic mastermind or a bad one. Eventually they do decide but they dont necessarily decide for the audience. For example I walked out of the movie with a different opinion of him than Tris. Whether thats a problem or a virtue of the series cant be known until the next episode which is almost something to look forward to. At least its not to be dreaded.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Dear me where do I even start with this calamity of a film? ""Allegiant"" the third installment in the underwhelming ""Divergent"" franchise of young adult sci-fi is hackwork from minute one. Here is an adventure so lacking creative energy that it never shows a glint of life in its eye. Wheres the tension clarity spirit? Its not the genres fault. Well-made futuristic slam-bangs can deliver blistering action solid acting and even a kind of poeticism. The problem here is that no one involved in this flat flabby dumbed-down production seems committed to cleaning up the mess. What we see is the kind of filmmaking people do when theyve been too long in a lengthy multi-movie contract. As is typical in childish movies the focus is spectacle not storytelling. The threequel returns us to author Veronica Roths tween Tomorrowland where post-apocalyptic society has been sliced into factions with specific skill sets. Following the previous chapters political revolt the peaceable hippies of the Amity tribe Candors tell-the-truth troop and the others have united. Resembling the rabble after the French Revolution they pull henchmen for the old government into public executions. So much for liberty and equality. Add that sort of mischief to her homelands crumbling Chicago setting and its clear why feisty nonconformist Tris (Shailene Woodley) leads a posse of pals past the citys imprisoning borders to the red rusty world beyond. Because this is sci-fi with a romantic angle hunky love interest Four (Theo James) comes along for equally unconvincing scenes of kissing the star and fighting stuntmen. In the advanced civilization beyond people float around inside balloons drive across the sky in dumpy vehicles that resemble Smart Cars and battle adversaries with micro-flying saucers that could be used as table coasters. In control are a new breed of killjoy grown-ups guided by David (Jeff Daniels) whose Cheshire Cat smile instantly identifies him as a no-goodnik. The young cast do much running shooting and inane discussion of the convoluted plot. They also seize and crash a bubble-shaped getaway aircraft. The crude visual effects resemble something you would find in a thrift-shop video game. Allegiant  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense violence and action thematic elements and partial nudity. I did connect with that tailspin crash scene though. Watching ""Allegiant"" is like looking out an airplanes window as the wings peel loose. What a compost heap of squandered talent is here. Woodley whose talents shine in edifying dramas like ""The Descendants"" and ""The Spectacular Now"" is miscast feeling wooden in every shot. The usually dependable Daniels whose secretive villainy should make us quiver acts with lethargic resignation. Naomi Watts a subtle actor who took over as a series villain after killing off Kate Winslet tries to rev her scenes in fifth gear as if this story is truly about her characters private personal crisis and she is determined to make it work. Bad as it is we are still far from the finish line. The closing shot is pure marketing reminding us that the final installment is still a year away. If you feel like theres no point in going through the motions any further I agree. Apparently the cast and crew do too. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its no secret that the process of adapting young-adult fantasy book series into a blockbuster film franchise has become somewhat ritualized Start with a screenplay that sticks as close to the source material as possible hire a competent journeyman with a good eye for casting to start the first movie or two eventually settle on a more technically polished journeyman to take the series home and split the final installment into two films. The Divergent Series as the sequels to Divergent refer to themselves in ads has trudged through this routine with grim determination receiving neither the hearty box office and critical reinforcement of the Harry Potter or Hunger Games films nor the kind of utter indifference that lets these franchises die on the vine. Even their behind-the-scenes shifts seem halfhearted Director Robert Schwentke replaced Neil Burger on the second installment remains in place for the penultimate Allegiant and was presumably expected at some point to return for the fourth but has been traded out for Lee Toland Krieger.None of this has dramatically affected the series low-rent vibe but there are signs in Allegiant that Schwentke is having some fun on his way to an early exit. Insurgent left off with designated special hero Tris (Shailene Woodley) her taut glowering boyfriend Four (Theo James) and the rest of the previously sorted citizens of Chicago discovering that their entire stupid trait-sorting society was an experiment conducted by a mysterious group that lives outside the citys walls. In the new movie Fours revolutionary-leader mother Evelyn (Naomi Watts) wants to keep the borders closed and mete out justice to former oppressors while Tris and her YA boyfriend brigade (James Miles Teller Ansel Elgort; Zoe Kravitz is also there) defy authority yet again by venturing beyond the big wall.Their immediate surroundings turn out to be a Mars-like wasteland of irradiated crimsons and browns with ominous red rains occasionally pouring from the sky. At this point Allegiant starts resembling the covers of old sci-fi paperbacks an eye-pleasing trend that continues when Tris and company reach a futuristic city built on the former site of OHare Airport. Even before the new scenery that features far fewer blown-out buildings Schwentke exercises more style than he did last time around using richer colors and fluid camera movements to enliven a humdrum mob-led ""trial"" conducted in Chicago. He makes particularly dramatic use of Woodleys perfectly lit face looming in the foreground of the chaos (hair perfectly restyled since the previous sequel naturally).But after about 30 minutes of agreeably junky sci-fi that often exceeds the energy levels of its predecessors the inevitable happens Allegiant becomes a Divergent movie. This means it endlessly recombines Screen Gems action aesthetics and the worst bits of The Matrix Reloaded minus the R ratings. It also means that Tris meets David (Jeff Daniels) an architect if you will of her whole life so far as she and her friends attempt to integrate into a brand-new society--because the characters of Divergent have never met an ill-advised form of government they couldnt embrace then mistrust and attempt to overthrow.For an ongoing series about breaking free from categorization these movies really enjoy denying their characters forward momentum. The actors have the makings of an enjoyable ensemble especially with wiseass Miles Teller in the mix but for the third movie in a row his character Peter tags along with the heroes before turning duplicitous and selfish while Caleb (Elgort) is a pointy-headed nerd who doesnt always understand the nuances of human emotion and an older authority figure played by a name actor (here Daniels) may not be what he seems. There are neat sci-fi touches like personalized miniature drones that accompany characters into battle and trippy visualizations of the effect of a memory-erasing serum. But Allegiant while arguably the best in the series so far still winds up in the same dopey place--in this case with a particularly laughable final shot that essentially affixes an awkward on-screen asterisk to yet another call to arms. Maybe that call will be answered next time with enough incremental improvements to finally notch a good Divergent movie a possibility Allegiant raises repeatedly and frustratingly. Ultimately though this movie isnt just adhering to a formula; its carefully following a recipe designed to offset any good ingredients that get mixed in there by mistake.

At least the first one typically has a happier ending.Not so with ""The Divergent Series Allegiant -- Part 1."" Not the movie itself the ending of which Id never give away (and for which youll have to wait until 2017 anyway). No I mean the quality of the film and the greedy stretching it out. If you think the name is inelegant wait until you see the movie.From left to right Christina (Zoe Kravitz) Tris (Shailene Woodley) Four (Theo James) Caleb (Ansel Elgort) Tori (Maggie Q) and Peter (Miles Teller) in ""The Divergent Series Allegiant - Part 1."" (Photo Murray Close)OK OK that may be a little harsh. After all the series does star Shailene Woodley who is always interesting. But the problem with stretching a three-part story into four parts is that you have to fill time. The filler does ""Allegiant"" no favors and robs the audience of what many came for in the first place Woodley.Thankfully Miles Teller is still around as the delightfully duplicitous Peter always ready to sell out a friend if he thinks it will help him out. Spoiler alert He is who he is.But for much of the film Woodleys Tris the unlikely heroine of the first two films stands around in a white dress while David (Jeff Daniels) telegraphing his intentions from a mile away studies her DNA and Four (Theo James) fights the main battles.How did it come to this?As you will recall civilization was separated into factions and once youre in one you stay. But a small number of people -- like Tris and Four -- were different. They were divergent (see title) and as such were enemies of the state. But Tris and Four helped lead a revolt that opened the wall that prevented people from leaving their segmented society.RELATED Shailene Woodleys Allegiant ascendenceThats where the new film begins with a delighted populace heading for the other side of the wall and presumably freedom.Until the recently opened gates are closed. So much for those first two movies. Back to your spots folks. We have time to kill.But Tris Four Peter Tris brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and her pal Christina (Zoe Kravitz) scale the wall in an escape attempt. Do they make it? What do you think? Though maybe there is a surprise in there somewhere.They roam through what looks like a nuclear-scorched wasteland and eventually find their way to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. (Somewhere Ted Cruz is already promising to get rid of it on his first day in office.) David is the boss and he is particularly interested in Tris genetic makeup for reasons that would sound more interesting than they really are if I spelled them out; you can sit through that on your own.Or not. Your choice. Really you could probably pass on this movie and wait for the actual finale and not miss much. Four who heads out on a mission to help some kids or so he thinks realizes Davids intentions might just possibly be a little bit less noble than advertised.Meanwhile on the other side of the wall Fours mother Evelyn (Naomi Watts) is girding for civil war with Johanna (Octavia Spencer). It all becomes a bit muddled but things get a little more interesting with the threat of a serum that wipes out everyones memories. Perhaps the screenwriters got a dose.Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Tris (Shailene Woodley) in ""The Divergent Series Allegiant - Part 1."" (Photo Murray Close)In reality though its all a holding pattern. Like the ""Twilight"" series ""The Hunger Games"" and even ""Harry Potter"" the penultimate entry in these series is simply a placeholder. Though even by those hurry-up-and-wait standards director Robert Schwentke seems content with just the waiting part.Woodley is in there giving it her all and Teller certainly knows how to play a creep. The CGI is spotty -- layered and interesting in places less so in others.Lets just call ""Allegiant"" what it is A way for the studio to make money and bring you back next year for the real finale.

"The Divergent Series sputters in Allegiant (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Divergent Series sputters in Allegiant (PG-13) Shailene Woodley and Theo James return in the third installment in the series based on the novels by Veronica Roth. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com3/17/2016 Editor rating 2 At the end of Insurgent the previous movie in the dystopian franchise The Divergent Series the characters trapped in a futuristic bombed-out Chicago learned they were part of an experiment conducted by people outside their walled-off city. In Allegiant which should be but isnt the final installment they learn who these people are and what theyve been up to. Not surprisingly the answer isnt good. Based on Veronica Roths series of young adult novels Allegiant -- like its predecessors -- is a movie you want to like more than you actually do. Its got a strong protagonist in Tris (Shailene Woodley) raised to be selfless but possessing vast reserves of courage and a fierce sense of justice. Shes confident enough to defy the wishes of de factor leader Evelyn (Naomi Watts) who has taken over in the wake of Insurgents revelations. But shes flexible enough to forgive her brother Caleb (Woodleys Fault in Our Stars co-star Ansel Elgort) for his betrayal. Shes also got excellent taste in men Her boyfriend is the tough tender Four (Theo James) Evelyns son who is never threatened by his girlfriends supremacy and so handsome Buzzfeed writes about his looks with frightening regularity. And yet the film moves jerkily in fits and starts squandering its promising setup and bogging down in explanation. Allegiant opens with the trials of Erudite faction members who tried to take over in the last film (""trials"" being a polite euphemism for executions). Four and Tris bust Caleb out of his prison before he can be shot round up their pals Christina (Zoe Kravitz) Tori (Maggie Q) and Peter (Miles Teller the films comic relief) and set out to investigate whats beyond the wall. What they find is a poisonous landscape of dread and hopelessness kind of like a Real Housewives reunion show. When theyre intercepted by a group of seemingly helpful sorts and brought back to a low-rent Cloud City Tris meets David (Jeff Daniels) who appears to be at the top of this particular food chain. Separated from her friends she learns she is ""pure"" and everybody else back in Chicago including Four is ""damaged."" This ominous concept is vague in the extreme When Tris says she doesnt really understand what it means youre right there with her. That David is duplicitous comes as no surprise but what is unexpected is the painful lack of solid action set pieces in the film. Theres some nice business when Tris and Co. break out of Chicago -- they run sideways up the wall -- and the drones they acquire are a good touch. But the rest of the action -- chases resolved easily and the final predictable rush against time -- are unremarkable and full of subpar (if not downright cheesy) special effects. The rest of the story is due in 2017 when the final film titled Ascendant arrives in theaters (Roths third book was split into two films a la The Hunger Games and Harry Potter series). That film will undoubtedly provide the final word on the war between Chicago and the outsiders. Unfortunately Allegiant doesnt offer many reasons to be excited about that. Cast Shailene Woodley Theo James Jeff Daniels Naomi Watts Olivia Spencer Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Zoe Kravitz. Director Robert Schwentke. Screenwriters Noah Oppenheim Adam Cooper Bill Collage. A Lionsgate release. Running time 121 minutes. Intense violence and action thematic elements and some partial nudity. Playing at area theaters.

(Murray Close/AP) BY Stephen Whitty NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 17 2016 846 AM Title ""The Divergent Series Allegiant"" Film Info With Shailene Woodley Theo James Naomi Watts. Shailene Woodley in more young-adult post-apocalyptic sci-fi. Bummer. Director Robert Schwentke. (201). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. The ""Divergent"" sci-fi saga is supposed to be about following your true path. So isnt it time it found its way back to being fun? The first/best film was about a class-conscious future where every citizens career was chosen by the state. Our plucky heroine Tris didnt fit into their neat little boxes however. She became a warrior -- and finally a rebel. By now though the only thing thats revolting is how dull the series has gotten. Confusing too. Theres a new villainess (hmm or is she?) Castes are turning into cults leaders are popping out of nowhere and everyone is plotting behind everybody elses back. Theo James (c.) plays a character named Four which is about where wed rank him on a 1-10 scale. (Murray Close/AP) Its like the presidential primaries but with better hair. None of the actors has much to do. As Tris (Shailene Woodley) mostly clenches her teeth and worries. As her boyfriend Four (Theo James) -- whose name reflects where youd put him on a scale of 1 to 10 -- spends his screentime turning his profile left and right looking for his best side. The first half-hour is taken up with a lot of squabbling and a badly shot chase. Then the whole thing switches to a sleek sophisticated secret city based in OHare Airport. Why? Because when you think of the future no doubt you also think of three-hour layovers and lousy ""pizza."" Shailene Woodley (with Ansel Elgort left) reprises her role in ""The Divergent Series Allegiant"" which is laughably bad. (Murray Close/AP) Eventually it turns out theres a whole other crew of villains we didnt even know about. Theres also some genetic gobbledygook about ""Pure"" and ""Damaged"" humans another chase scene and way too much CGI although some of the special effects are eye-catching -- invisible forcefields reptilian warships killer drones that look like hockey pucks. Its busy but wheres the real fun? Woodley remains grimly committed and Naomi Watts turns in a serious performance as our new slightly more complicated villain but the rest of the characters barely exist. Two hours later we know nothing more about them or the story than we did at the beginning -- except that theres still another sequel due next summer. And thats one thing to which I cant pledge allegiance.

"Review Allegiant an overly complicated mess - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Allegiant an overly complicated messBy Randy Myers San Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 03/16/2016 020000 PM PDTUpdated 03/16/2016 055337 PM PDT The second to last entry in what is a so-so franchise ""The Divergent Series Allegiant"" is squirrelly chasing from one big concept to another without satisfactorily executing most of them.The dystopian thriller benefits from Shailene Woodley as Tris a rabble-rouser who socks it to fascist-leaning villains who are dressed to kill. As usual she is fascinating to watch. But it is her presence along with that of Octavia Spencer Naomi Watts Miles Teller Ansel Elgort and now Jeff Daniels that makes us wonder what drew such an impressive cast to this ambitious but rather routine allegorical series based on Veronica Roths best-sellers. (L-R) Zoe Kravitz Christina Shailene Woodley as Tris Ansel Elgort as Caleb Theo James as Four Miles Teller as Peter and Maggie Q as Tori in The Divergent Series Allegiant. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) ( Murray Close/Lionsgate ) To its credit ""Allegiant"" succeeds in advancing a convoluted plot more than the previous entry ""Insurgent."" That film came off as a retread of the first and is best remembered for how it tried to distract us with an infusion of ""Inception""-like special effects. But ""Insurgent"" and the original ""Divergent"" were blessed with the presence of Kate Winslet as the icily evil Jeanine. ""Allegiant"" doesnt have her in it and we feel her absence painfully.The film begins promisingly with the nonconformist Tris and her crew which includes estranged brother Caleb (Elgort) finally scaling the electrified wall that hems in the people of a futuristic Chicago. This setup is juicy but what director Robert Schwentke shows us on the outside -- a mashup of commonplace elements from other dystopian bummers -- underwhelms.Advertisement To be fair Schwentke has his work cut out for him here. Roth has created a dense mythology with ""Divergent"" and its easy for anyone unfamiliar with its complicated storyline to get lost. So heres a cursory recap on whats gone down so farTris and other rebels have effectively stood up against a postapocalyptic Chicago society in which citizens have been lumped into specific groups or factions based on their ""virtues."" Tris is a Divergent -- an outsider with many attributes. In the climactic end of the last film Evelyn (Watts) leader of the Factionless killed Jeanine (Winslet) leader of the Erudite faction.As ""Allegiant"" opens with Evelyn as its unofficial leader Chicago society has not improved. Angry masses are demanding blood justice and Evelyn is willing to go along with that.As more complications arise and Tris leads the charge to go over the wall ""Allegiant"" leaps from scene to scene and moves chess pieces along without much elegance. A trio of screenwriters -- Noah Oppenheim Adam Cooper and Bill Collage -- has been charged with trying to make sense of all this and the result is a film in which characters mostly exclaim or explain things while special effects work overtime and our heroes spend a lot of time dodging imminent dangers that border on the ridiculous.Even the issues wedged between relationships ring false. Tris and her boyfriend Four (hunky Theo James) encounter rocky times once they meet David (Daniels). Four who is Evelyns son doesnt get much to do. A similar fate befalls Spencer who looks solemn as Johanna Watts who looks angry as Evelyn and Elgort who looks disgraced as Caleb. David too turns out to be a bland character who speaks softly as the leader of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare a high-tech outpost in an arid and toxic region outside of the Chicago wall a landscape known as the Fringe. He informs Tris she is ""pure."" Four is not pure of course. And David has a plan that involves Tris.This all leads to a silly action-packed finale that will make you chuckle for the wrong reasons. It also nudges an actor like Teller to go overboard trying to get laughs as the duplicitous Peter who is allegiant only to himself.With the dystopian plot and strong conflicted central heroine its hard not to compare ""Divergent"" to ""The Hunger Games.""While ""Allegiant"" is a livelier film than its counterpart -- Part III of the sonorous ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part I"" -- the ""Divergent"" franchise wilts overall in comparison. ""Games"" created complex characters with psychological depth and emotional heft and put them at risk while tackling bleak futuristic narrative themes. ""Divergent"" on the other hand gets snarled up in the threads of an overly complicated vision stranding its rather one-note characters in the process. Simply and sadly put This isnt a brave new world as imagined. Maybe theyll get there in the series final film set for release in summer 2017. But Im not holding out much hope.the divergent series Allegiant   Rating PG-13 (for intense violence and action thematic elements and some partial nudity)Cast Shailene Woodley Theo James Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Octavia Spencer Jeff Daniels Zoe Kravitz Naomi WattsDirector Robert SchwentkeRunning time 2 hoursPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Its based on Veronica Roths 2013 young-adult best-seller that wrapped up her ""Divergent"" trilogy. But as is the custom with such print-to-screen adaptations its been inflated into two movies for purely cash-grubbing reasons. (Looking at you ""Hunger Games."") ""Ascendant"" the sequel to this sequel is set for release in 2017. Most of the principals from last years ""Insurgent"" (part deux of the trilogy) are back with the exception of Kate Winslets evil overlord character who got killed off at the very end of ""Insurgent."" The killer is Naomi Watts character who steps immediately into Winslets evildoer shoes. Meet the new overlord same as the old overlord. As was true with ""The Hunger Games"" (you can think of the ""Divergent"" movies as JV versions of that series) it is absolutely essential for a viewer to have seen the earlier installments which pick up right where their predecessors ended to have the slightest hope of understanding whats up with the sequels. The complex social structure that divvied up humans into five so-called factions -- Abnegation Amity Candor Dauntless and Erudite -- in Roths postapocalyptic world has been overthrown by heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her allies. But with a new factionless dictatorship imposed by Watts character Evelyn the mother of Tris sweetheart and chief ally Four (Theo James) the two lovers decide to flee the ruined city of Chicago. They decamp with a handful of others several of dubious loyalty. Which is to say theyve betrayed the pair in the previous picture. They all go over the massive wall surrounding the city and into the irradiated wasteland beyond it. Confused yet? Oh you will be. In the wasteland is another city a paradisiacal place of swirly white futuristic architecture where a seemingly benevolent character played by Jeff Daniels rules. He explains that Tris is a genetically pure human the product of a several-centuries-long experiment to rehabilitate the damaged human genome from the effects of the atomic apocalypse. Shes pure. Everyone else is genetically damaged. Genetic purity must be re-established. As for the genetically damaged well an unpleasant fate is planned for them. Potent subject matter but handled with clumsy obviousness by director Robert Schwentke. Child abductions mass brainwashing murder plots and more nick-of-time narrow escapes than are possible to count are all part of the mix. The chemistry between Woodley and James is as tepid as ever. Daniels slips once more into the smooth-talking man-in-charge persona hes lately played in ""The Martian"" and ""Steve Jobs."" All of it feels warmed over reprocessed ... and yes confused.

It doesnt help that the basic psychological concepts underpinning the story still feel completely half-baked and idiotic. We pick up the story following the faction systems collapse at the end of the previous movie Insurgent. Naomi Wattss sneering Evelyn has taken charge of a ruined future Chicago backed by a multi-ethnic rabble of leather-clad twentysomethings who look like refugees from The Matrix. Its time for plucky Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her glowering paramour Four (Theo James) to blow town heading over the wall to find out what lurks in the wasteland beyond. (Spoiler Its Jeff Daniels.) For about half an hour this is fairly entertaining the rubble-strewn landscapes feel impressively real Woodley is a game heroine and Miles Teller is brilliantly typecast as a mouthy douchebag that no one likes. But as internal logic goes out of the window and the plot contrivances pile up (""Ive got a machine that can see through walls"" or ""I know how to fly a plane without ever having seen one before"") the film becomes increasingly trying. It all leads to a climax so staggeringly lazy and glib that you honestly expect Woodley just to turn to the camera in the final scene shrug her shoulders and walk off.

""The Divergent Series Allegiant"" brings back the same cast of characters to do more or less exactly what they did in the previous films only this time in sets with more sci-fi gloss than postapocalyptic grunge. Shailene Woodley is back again as Tris the lowly girl from Abnegation turned guerrilla leader -- a.k.a. The Specialest Girl in the World a.k.a. The One. Where last we left her she and her band of rebels went and upended the whole governing system the one that divided people into factions like Dauntless (the soldiers) Amity (the farmers) and Erudite (the smug). Tris and her boy Four (Theo James) dont fit into any of those factions Theyre Divergents and the film picks up just after theyve unlocked a secret prophecy revealing that theres a whole functioning society outside of the walled-in Chicago previously thought to be the last glimmer of life on Earth. See Video Shailene Woodley Discovers a World Beyond the Wall in First Allegiant Trailer So our messianic heroes hightail it over the wall joined again by Tris brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) the double-dealing Peter (an enjoyably smarmy Miles Teller whose role has greatly expanded as his star has risen) and the loyal Christina (a barely-there Zoe Kravitz whose role well hasnt). The character beats are set in stone by this point and ""Allegiant"" director Robert Schwentke (""R.I.P.D."") sticks to them like a flight plan. Four broods pouts and then kicks ass while Tris is earnest and athletic. Peter betrays them every chance he gets just as he has many times before but the collected half-billion at the box office of those previous films makes a powerful case for forgive and forget. Our wanderers dont spend long in the wild however. They rather quickly make it the Bureau of Genetic Welfare a scientific outpost and hybrid of the USS Enterprise and Apple Store where many shocking secrets will be revealed. In keeping the best recurring element of the series the Bureau is staffed uniquely by gym-toned twentysomethings and one respected character actor. (This time Jeff Daniels.) Also Read Divergent Finale Allegiant Will Be Split Into Two Movies Noah Oppenheim (""The Maze Runner"") and Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (""Exodus Gods and Kings"") adapt  Veronica Roths novel of the same name but not of course the entire novel Once again producers have divided the final book in a YA series into two separate films and that padding really shows once the film moves wholly into the digitally embellished confines of the Bureau. Simply put the films momentum just crawls to a stop during which the normally active heroine is reduced to a vehicle for received exposition. Schwentke and the three screenwriters try to keep the action moving -- back in Chicago a factional civil war is brewing between Naomi Watts and Octavia Spencer hamming and slumming both -- but the main characters remain peripheral. Though the director stages several scenes with real visual flair including one memorable sequence where we see the effects of a powerful weapon from the perspective of the man its being used on nothing can keep the franchise beast from consuming the film. Stuck in the green-screen world of the futuristic Bureau Tris and gang spend the majority of the film watching the big action on virtual reality screens and learning important revelations that will doubtlessly come into play -- in the next installment. Also Read Divergent Series Finale Seeks New Director as Robert Schwentke Drops Out The upending revelations of the previous story and need to replace departing villain Kate Winslet with another big bad results in a film thats mainly focused on reshuffling the board and putting pieces in play doing so with a series of long speeches in front of poorly rendered vistas. Daniels will no doubt make a perfectly respectable antagonist one movie from now but the green-screen backdrops and dry exposition with which hes saddled hardly provide enough scenery to nibble let alone chew on. Indeed the drive to divvy up one book into two films results in a narrative that is two parts set-up and no part payoff. While the screenwriters manage to get the leads back into the walled-up city for a rousing third-act rescue ""Allegiant"" ends up feeling like a mid-season climax to serialized TV drama. The pieces are in play the wheels in motion. Stay tuned loyal viewers and youll get your answers next year. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER 3/18/2016 Shailene Woodley is back for the third part of the sci-fi series based on the hit YA trilogy. The locations change and the characters each get a new tattoo but theres nothing very divergent about Allegiant the third screen adaptation in what will be a four-part series based on Veronica Roths bestselling YA trilogy. With director Robert Schwentke returning to the helm and a cast lead by Shailene Woodley suiting up for another sci-fi actioner where big ideas are often bottled down into resounding cliches this handsomely made effects-driven vehicle offers more of the same and then some -- a fact that will hardly bother fans whove already pledged their allegiance to the franchise but wont convert any nonbelievers. Slicing Roths final novel into two separate movies a la The Hunger Games and giving us a world-within-a-world conundrum a la The Maze Runner its hard to see what exactly distinguishes this series from its competitors outside an initial premise which however ridiculous had a certain hook to it. But now that the various personality factions of Divergent and Insurgent have been dissipated were left with a familiar Brave New World-type scenario where Woodleys Tris Prior takes on an evil empire that wants to turn humans into genetically purified puppets. To be Candor about it (using Divergent-speak) this is far from a Dauntless enterprise and despite four credited writers one often gets the impression that Allegiant was designed by an algorithm trying to please the maximum amount of viewers with the minimum amount of flair or intelligence. Any movie where about 20 minutes in the lead character says ""I think were finally going to be okay"" guarantees this is not going to happen yet it takes Tris a good hour to figure that out while everyone in the audience is already several beats ahead of her. Despite such obvious flaws the films opening reels have a certain panache to them especially after Tris her lover Four (Theo James) and their assorted allies or former foes flee a city on the verge of civil war toward a no mans land that lies beyond a massive concrete wall. (The fact that the city is meant to be dystopian Chicago and the no mans land controlled by a fiefdom at OHare Airport less than 20 miles away somewhat detracts from the wonder of it all. But at least these are real places.) The early scenes allow Schwentke and VFX supervisor Stefen Fangmeier (Wanted) to dish out some impressive effects-pieces coating Tris and her buds with blood-colored acid rain that pours down on the apocalyptic landscape they hike across then afterward with a Matrix-like slime meant to decontaminate them when they arrive at the Bureau of Genetic Welfare where they learn that their beloved Windy City is actually just a giant laboratory experiment under constant observation. Given new wrist tattoos and new assignments at the Bureau Tris is sent to meet with the hamlets supreme leader while her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) her friend Christina (Zoe Kravitz) her frenemy Peter (Miles Teller) and the very skeptical Four are dispatched throughout a military-like complex that looks a lot like the training facilities in the other films -- albeit with enhanced technology that includes mini drones and a virtual-reality surveillance network used to monitor Chicagos activity. Tris big encounter with Bureau chief David (Jeff Daniels) in his Oblivion-style office provides some of the films most crucial revelations including the fact that nearly everyone has been genetically modified except somehow for her. Yet these key sequences are undercut by the rather goofy science and psychology behind it all -- not to mention the idea that Tris actually believes David has good intentions while anyone watching Daniels with his buzz-cut and head honcho suit (lapel pin included) can only know that hes a wolf in designer clothing. Once the cat is out of the bag the story heads in predictable directions and does so with little ingenuity or wit even if Tellers snarky Peter is there to inject random touches of humor into such a self-serious enterprise. Other characters are given short shrift with Factionless leader Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and Amity peacemaker Johanna (Octavia Spencer) facing off back in Chicago in what seems to be an entire plotline reduced to a few forgettable moments. Ditto for the ongoing love affair between Tris and Four which is dispatched with in a handful of sun-drenched tete-a-tetes (and tongue-to-tongues) that feel like pure fluff despite the conviction of the two leads. Indeed Woodley has always managed to make Tris and her various transformations -- from Dauntless to Divergent from Divergent to genome queen here -- seem rather natural and she pulls it off once again even though the hair/makeup unit went a bit overboard on the highlights and eyeliner this time. James is fine as her swarthy arm-candy while the rest of the cast works it way through lots of half-baked dialogue. Yet even passable performances can hardly dispel the kitsch level of this third installment especially with a finale whose major plot device looks like it was lifted from an episode of the old Batman TV series. At best what Schwentke and his skilled craft team have done is set up the major confrontation of the last chapter providing one or two action highlights along the way -- most notably an early scene where Tris and co. scale the wall surrounding Chicago like a band of alpinists from the future. Otherwise for a film that takes great pride in its heroines nonconformism pretty much everything in Allegiant feels conventional.

Gazing out over the wall that encircles Chicago at the end of ""The Divergent Series Allegiant"" Tris Prior longs for the time when she didnt know what lay on the other side. Her imagination like ours had clearly been primed for exciting revelations beyond the realm of Veronica Roths juvie sci-fi franchise which inexplicably switches allegories late in the game. What began as a massive if astoundingly implausible sociology exercise -- where citizens were sorted into character-specific factions like Hogwarts first-years awaiting their house assignments -- has morphed into a downright ridiculous anti-eugenics parable. And whereas Roths political subtext was previously rich enough to overlook the films second-rate action set pieces her message has become so muddled Summit has every reason to worry whether tween audiences (already down 20 million since the first movie) will remain allegiant to a weakening franchise through its forthcoming fourth episode expected summer 2017. Picking and choosing details from Roths complicated and somewhat controversial third novel a trio of screenwriters new to the series deliver the first half of an artificially protracted two-part finale which diverges not only from the source material but also from where returning director Robert Schwentke left things in the previous film. There as the music swelled we saw ""factionless"" chieftess Evelyn (Naomi Watts) executing the dictatorial Janine (whose accomplices now face a similar fate) while the citizens swarmed en masse toward the wall finally opened after more than 200 years. Except as ""Allegiant"" begins the wall still stands and Evelyns heavily armed guards make every effort to keep the city cut off from the outside world where wed been told ""Mankind waits for you with hope."" Running vertically up the cement surface just five characters manage to cross the barrier here Tris (Shailene Woodley sporting yet another new hairstyle); her brother Caleb (played by ""The Fault in Our Stars"" love interest Ansel Elgort); her actual love interest Four (Theo James); Dauntless ally Christina (Zoe Kravitz); and the consistently unreliable Peter (Miles Teller). The first movie actually began on the other side of this wall panning across the evocative sight of a freighter abandoned in a field of tall green grass (the boat could still be seen in ""Insurgent""). Now in its place Tris finds what looks like a Martian desert where it rains toxic red water and the life expectancy is just two or three decades. A futuristic force field creates a second kind of wall this one isolating the survivors of something called the ""Purity War"" whose post-apocalyptic effects supposedly explain the radical change of setting. Picked up by armed soldiers Tris and her team are brought to what remains of Chicago OHare Intl. Airport. (""Whats an airport?"" asks Caleb who might as well also ask ""Whats a nation?"" These shut-in characters have an awful lot to learn.) Finally three films into the series we get to discover why the city has been set up the way it is At some indeterminate point in Americas future (and ""Divergents"" past) the government started fooling with human DNA attempting to eliminate unwanted traits (such as a so-called ""murder gene"") from its citizens. The effort backfired and the new genetically modified population rose up in rebellion reducing the United States to a radioactive wasteland and forcing the Bureau to take drastic (and totally non-scientific) measures. In what sounds like an embarrassingly naive plan the Bureau fenced in Chicago filled it with genetically ""damaged"" citizens and imposed the faction system to ensure peace effectively hoping that the human genome would heal itself. Meanwhile using incredibly sophisticated surveillance technology these outsiders tuned in to monitor every little detail a la ""The Truman Show."" If their goal was to find Divergents it raises the question why they didnt intervene during Janines genocidal reign -- or now as an unconvincing civil war brews between Evelyn and former Amity spokeswoman Johanna (Octavia Spencer). Its foolish to get too caught up in such questions although asking audiences to turn off their brains basically reduces ""The Divergent Series"" to just another sci-fi action franchise -- and not a very good one at that. With plot holes bigger than the chunks missing from its dystopian skyline (still the best visual effect in the wildly inconsistent CG-dominated mix) ""Allegiant"" will seem awfully meager to those who so recently feasted on ""Mad Max Fury Road"" ... or ""The Hunger Games"" or countless other superior examples of the genre. What this more conventional installment does have going for it is a fresh ""Tron Legacy""-like score (from composer Joseph Trapanese) and a milder youth-skewing sensibility The characters shoot what look like toy plastic guns hitch rides in floating ""plasma globes"" and zoom about in bullfrog-shaped hovercrafts. Plus the series never second-guesses the fact that its strongest characters are female whether its role model Tris or rival leaders Evelyn and Johanna. ""Allegiant"" introduces yet another potential villain this one a superficially benevolent bureaucrat named David (Jeff Daniels cementing the authority-figure typecasting seen since ""The Newsroom""). David is obsessed with genetic purity a concept he has incorporated into the decor of his immaculate white office with its helix-shaped staircase and ivory-tower location perched a hundred useless floors above ground. Apart from Tris David doesnt seem to care about any of the anonymous souls in Chicago -- an attitude presumably shared by Schwentke who gets some of the worst performances from extras in any film of this scale. Although ""Allegiant"" does recapture the original films sense of constantly discovering and adapting to fresh information audiences no longer identify with anyone in particular. For those who thrilled at the idea that she was somehow special Tris has been pushed aside while Four goes out on dangerous missions to ""the Fringe"" visiting tent cities where David abducts children for purposes the movie never satisfyingly explains. When Davids plan goes askew he relies on Peter to release memory gas into Chicago resulting in laughable scenes in which the awkward aforementioned extras try to outrun clouds of orange smoke. While its up to Tris to stop David from wiping everyones memories that plot is virtually the opposite of the more complicated sacrifice Roth imagined for her in the book. Its as if the filmmakers have lost interest in Tris -- and who can blame them? Here we realize that by opening the box at the end of the previous film Tris revealed herself to be not ""divergent"" nor special but effectively the same genetic state as everyone sitting in the movie theater -- which is to say purely average. Maybe the fourth film will recover what made Tris such a unique heroine although in contrast with the divided last chapters of ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Hunger Games"" theres no epic villain for us spend the intervening year rooting against. And with no real cliffhanger to keep us interested after ""Divergent"" ""Insurgent"" and ""Allegiant"" we cant help feeling a little Impatient.

Aja says July 13 2016 at 346 pm You mentioned that it never vears from the fact that its strongest leads are female which is mostly true but I find it troubling the way they portrayed Tris in this movie. In the book she and Four fight because Four doesnt trust her instinct on how the handle David and the Government problems and takes sides with Nita. They end up leading a different type of rebellion causing a lot of problems. Tris was having a hard time trusting Four after that as this has become a been a pattern with him. In the movie its Tris who doesnt trust Fours instincts and she comes off as the weak one who causes people to get hurt. I dont remember every detail of how it happened in the book as I read them years ago but it is typical. Completely change the dynamic and make Tris look like the irrational one who wouldnt listen to reason. I cant imagine this part would be in the last movie as it should have already happened. Also the element of it being a pattern with Four would be lost because of this change. Then again doesnt seem like theres much left for the last movie. Pretty dissapointing overall. Reply Kenny says April 1 2016 at 420 am Too much talking ... I think this basically a transition movie for the last one. But the story is so true about human being. There is always something that we may not agree to no matter where we go. Reply ctrent29 says March 30 2016 at 804 am Has anyone considered the possibility that the real problem of the movie series are the novels? Reply Margie says March 29 2016 at 115 pm I read negative comments about Allegiant movie so did not go see it when it first openedI went today and absolutely loved it not understanding all the bad reviews concerning itjust hoping when the last one comes outTris will not die?? That would ruin it all for me Reply TW says March 30 2016 at 220 pm Going tonight Cant wait Ive seen lots of movies with bad reviews that I loved Reply Janet Abbey says March 17 2016 at 310 pm I thought the first one Divergent directed and produced by Neil Burger was a wonder. Summit removed him - they always do this after the first one - and hired a CGI hack. Twilight did the same with Breaking Dawn Part III(Condon)awful follow ups.You just had to know Scummit was going in this direction. But thie genre is now over this one that made Scummit a playa. Scummit has now run its course with YA crap follow ups and has no future vision. Reply Sharron Hammer says March 6 2016 at 1113 pm I love Miles Teller and cannot wait to see him in something befitting him. And Im 74 years old There have to be other young women out there awaiting the same thing Reply Hotty says March 7 2016 at 326 pm He does have that very old hollywood look going on. Reply irwinator1992 says March 6 2016 at 505 pm Given the terrible reception of the book series and its film adaptations I can see this making half of what the previous film did at the box office. I can also see poor exit ratings from the audience and a single-digit score on Rotten Tomatoes. Shailene Woodley will need a David O. Russell-style bollocking if she wants to find success in Hollywood. Reply View From The Porch (ClydesPlace) says March 6 2016 at 153 pm If they were wise they would have stayed as far away from the source material of the third book as possible. What we find is that about 80 per cent of those who read Allegiant felt that they had been had. And it wasnt just the final scenario it was the lame idiotic way in which Roth handled it to basically say ""Im doing this for shock value and nothing more because I can."" You can find literally thousands upon thousands of readers review who took issue with it probably the same ones who have been staying away from this poor mans Hunger Games. Think of the third Terminator movie which basically said the first two were pointless exercises. Same thing with Roths Allegiant. The studio had already bought the series and begun filming the first book when the final novel came out. One has to think they felt like they had been had as well having to make a silk purse out of a sows ear. Youd have to think they werent particularly happy especially with the overwhelming negativity regarding the book. Reply allegiantus says March 6 2016 at 219 pm They have an entire movie next year to stay far from the source material as Allegiant part 1 uses most of the books material anyways Reply View From The Porch (ClydesPlace) says March 6 2016 at 348 pm Like I said they better stray far far away. I wish I could convince my girlfriend to stay away but that would mean revealing the plotting of the final book and I cant do that. So unless they change it drastically shell be very unhappy she paid her way through this movie series to come to that idiotic conclusion. Having read the atrocious final novel is in fact a huge advantage for those who did and knew where this was going especially after the producers said they saw no reason to change it. Apparently they changed their minds but well see. allegiantus says March 6 2016 at 623 pm Yeah. If anything to say the least I hope you and your girlfriend enjoy Allegiant more than the book if anything =) Dunstan says March 6 2016 at 936 am Did no one at Variety catch the egregious typo in the headline? ""This first half of the artificially split two-part finally..."" It should be FINALE not ""finally."" Geez. Reply Penn says March 6 2016 at 213 pm Finale somebody says something. I just caught another egregious typo in the review of Peter and the Farm. Variety material goes out all over the world. This is embarrassing. Reply Marie says March 6 2016 at 931 am That what happens when you try to ride the coattails of Hunger Games.. Reply Bill says March 6 2016 at 905 am A really boring second rate film series. Id like to say that I cant believe that there are going to be four of them but in todays unoriginal and repetitive Hollywood unfortunately I can. Reply allegiantus says March 6 2016 at 637 am All I know is Im going to love Allegiant Reply Liz says March 6 2016 at 435 am Yes because when you want to eradicate a certain genome from a population the best thing to do is lock them all up in an enclosed area and force them to breed with each other for 200 years. That wont make the genome worse or anything. I cannot believe they kept this idiotic backstory. Reply PibbityBibbity says March 5 2016 at 1101 pm They should have stuck to the books. They lost me in the second movie with the magical mysterious cube storyline that was never in the books. As soon as that storyline started I stopped watching and dont need to see any more. Reply allegiantus says March 6 2016 at 638 am Okay just cause they didnt stick to the book does not mean that it wouldve been a great movie. Insurgent the book had a way too complicated plot for a film Reply alessio says March 5 2016 at 1129 pm you mean the box that is basically the hard drive in the book? and the review is saying the exact opposite of your comment they had every reason to change as much as possible from the badly executed books (specially allegiant) Reply John Miller says March 5 2016 at 1030 pm When I was a teen I didnt at all care for teen movies and it drove me nuts when my mom took me and my brother to them. I wanted to see the most adult-themed movies possible.
