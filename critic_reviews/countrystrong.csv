This Hollywood weepie might have strong in the title but it misses the point with its portrait of a Grammy-winning alcoholic country superstar in meltdown - played from the heart but unpersuasively by Gwyneth Paltrow. Her character is apparently based on Britney Spears prone to onstage ramblings stints in rehab followed by a comeback tour - orchestrated by her manager-husband (Tim McGraw a country star turned actor).There is an interesting movie to be made about this toxic marriage shes a messy drunk diva-ish and needy; he pulls her out of rehab too early. Is this because his prize cow isnt milking well? Or from a heartfelt belief that she is most happy on the road? The question is never really answered. Instead in waltzes an ambitious little missy (Leighton Meester from Gossip Girl) a young pretty rival dying to sink her claws into Gwyneths career and man. Ive been ready for this since I was four and a half years old she announces - one banality in a script full of them.Paltrow gives it her best but is so conspicuously doing country. Were meant to believe she has spent half her life staring into a vodka bottle but she glows like shes just stepped out of a yoga retreat. The actors sing for real cheesy-as-hell songs which give the whole thing a whiff of vanity. None of which is a patch on Sissy Spacek  as Lynn in 1980s Coal Miners Daughter.

Comments click to enlarge Country Strong Video Rated PG-13  116 minutes  2011 Gwyneth Paltrow plays a Nashville singing star whose career and marriage are both on the skids. Paltrows warm supple voice is well-suited to plaintive ballads and the other two actors trying out their pipes--Garrett Hedlund as her young lover and Leighton Meester as her fresh-faced rival--also acquit themselves admirably. But Shana Festes screenplay seldom rises above the level of daytime TV; the only actor who triumphs over her trite dialogue is Tim McGraw in a nonsinging role as Paltrows husband and manager.

By Peter Rainer Film critic January 7 2011 Save for later Saved Gwyneth Paltrow (l.) and Tim McGraw are shown in a scene from Country Strong. Scott Garfield/Sony-Screen Gems/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of What would country-music movies be without heartbreak? From ""Coal Miners Daughter"" and ""Sweet Dreams"" right up through ""Crazy Heart"" the genre is awash in acid tears.""Country Strong"" is the latest and in many ways the least impressive entrant in the achy-breaky sweepstakes. It stars Gwyneth Paltrow as superstar Kelly Canter a Faith Hill-style singer whom we first encounter drying out in rehab. Paltrow doesnt make many movies these days so the question is Why this one?The answer is obvious. This is an Oscar-size role she can really sink her teeth into. The bigness of the role however doesnt match its middling execution. Paltrow isnt bad - she even does her own singing - but writer-director Shana Feste hasnt done much to rehabilitate a very tired conception. (As an example of how to do it right check out ""Nashville"" with Ronee Blakleys classic performance as a rehabbed wreck of a star or ""Payday"" with Rip Torn.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Its not enough to see a legend at the end of her tether. We have to see why she was a legend to begin with. Alas this only happens in Kellys very first scene. Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund) a talented singer-songwriter who also works at the rehab facility plays her a new song on his guitar. She smiles moonily at him - it turns out they are also lovers - and then on the spot composes an improved lyric. Instantly we see how good she is and how much this music still means to her. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Soon she is prematurely plucked from rehab by her husband-manager James (country star Tim McGraw who does no singing in the film). With Beau accompanying her on her comeback tour as a combination opening act and traveling companion James holds out the hope that Kelly can revive her career and deep-six her demons. He must not have seen very many country movies over the years.Along for the ride is beauty- queen-turned-singer Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester) another opener for Kelly and a potential love mate for Beau. She has a kewpie doll concupiscence that is supposed to camouflage her steely star-in-the-making resolve. The camouflage is laid on pretty thick though because I failed to see the artist underneath. Since Feste doesnt go for the usual ""All About Eve"" vibe here - the gaga Chiles never seeks to undermine her idol - there isnt much for Meester to do except look as the occasion calls for it either charmingly bereft or charmingly charming.Beau meanwhile is busy carrying on with Kelly right under her husbands nose. Its potentially interesting that James in the cause of her career and his livelihood would condone however uncomfortably his wifes dalliances. But Feste doesnt credibly stage-manage the menage. James may be a fool in love (or maybe just a fool) but there are far too many scenes where he looks poleaxed by Kellys and Beaus blatant indiscretions.Maybe things would have perked up if James had been given more of an opportunity to drop his baleful blahness. Or if Beau had a chance to be more than a studly-saintly helpmate with a good pair of lungs. Feste is quoted in the press notes as saying ""I love that you get these very masculine men singing about getting left alone and having their hearts broken; they become very vulnerable in their lyrics and write about things most men dont really talk about."" Well Beau is vulnerable all right. Between Kelly and him theres enough vulnerability to power a thermonuclear reactor.Perhaps the most misguided moment in the movie comes near the end when Kelly tottering to glory knocks em dead at a concert in Dallas. Its believable even essential that she revives herself in this way but the concert itself is such a glitzy piece of Vegas-style claptrap that you wonder what Feste was thinking.If she was trying to demonstrate how far from her down-home roots Kelly has traveled then why the note of triumphalism? And if Feste actually believes that this show is country nirvana she has no business making a country movie.

By Mary Pols Friday Jan. 07 2011 Share Tweet Read Later Send to Kindle Scott Garfield / Screen GemsGwyneth Paltrow in Country Strong Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME In the unfortunately weak Country Strong Gwyneth Paltrow plays country-and-western singer Kelly Canter an alcoholic. She struts sings swills sleeps around and in some truly perilous acting moments intended to be rich with metaphor cradles an orphaned baby bird. Anytime an actress steps this far out of her comfort zone without a strong script to support her she has to hope audiences are on her side. And they might be if this were Sandra Bullock say or perhaps Jennifer Garner. But this is Paltrow the American actress whose achievements seem to have piled up in reverse proportion to the goodwill she inspires. If theres an opposite of Americas Sweetheart shes it. How did this happen? Things started off so well. Paltrow earned deserved praise for films like Emma and Sliding Doors and took home an Oscar at 26 for the winning Shakespeare in Love. A decade ago she was cool enough for Wes Anderson to cast her in The Royal Tenenbaums playing the aloof and miserable Margot. Now that character seems to have leached over into the public perception of Paltrow herself. (See portraits of country musics top stars.)Envy would be the first suspect. Paltrow came to Hollywood as a wealthy insider (her mother is Blythe Danner; the father she lost to cancer in 2002 was director Bruce Paltrow) and dated Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck before marrying British rock star Chris Martin. She has two adorable children and though 38 she is capable of carrying off shorts with 2-in. (5 cm) inseams. She seems perpetually at her physical peak which gives her a vibe reminiscent of Dorian Gray. She pals around with Mario Batali Beyonce and Jay-Z. Even her Spanish is pretty. When word got out that shed be making a guest appearance on Glee in November Gleeks viewed this as an invasion; the woman Britains Daily Mail once called ""the blonde bore"" seemed more likely to be a slushie thrower than a kindred spirit to the glee clubs misfits. She then proceeded to turn in such a solid performance as a suspiciously perfect substitute teacher (a spoof of her own image; clearly she has a sense of humor) that even her detractors had a hard time denying she was great. Still the praise had an edge the New York Times noted that her performance all but erased the recent perception of her as a ""smug unbearable scold."" Note the all but. The woman who is clearly one of lifes winners cant seem to get ahead in the public-opinion polls. See videos of the Gleeks who are making music of their own.

You dont need to sit through this two-hour melodrama to confirm that; videos of her singing - such as her recent CMA Awards Show performance - are just a click away on YouTube. If writer-director Shana Feste had some other point in mind she fails to make it in this muddled mess of achy-breaky cliches and claptrap. Really Country Strong is the most certifiably strange movie in a while.In its tragic tale of a superstar (Paltrows Kelly Canter) who is drowning in the glitz and isolation of her success Country Strong recalls (and freely borrows from) movies including A Star Is Born and The Rose. The ways it tries to tell a humble-origins love story scalded and scarred when its thrown into the celebrity-media microwave compel unfortunate comparisons to Coal Miners Daughter (Kelly even names a baby bird she rescues Loretta Lynn). In its portraits of young talent either pursuing stardom (Leighton Meester as beauty-queen singer Chiles Stanton) or avoiding it (Garrett Hedlund as spotlighting-shunning singer Beau Hutton) the movie mixes references and storytelling tropes from just about every movie about show business ever made.The result is not surprisingly a film that cant decide what it wants to be when it grows up. The film opens with the hunky Beau traipsing from his late-night gig as a honky-tonk dreamboat to mop-and-bucket attendant at a recovery clinic where hes become the swoon-struck plaything of a freshly sober Kelly. In short order were introduced to Kellys husband-manager James (actual country superstar Tim McGraw) and bashful ingenue Chiles. Then the movie whisks everyone off on a three-city comeback tour of Texas.Its impossible to sketch a synopsis of Country Strong that either connects all the dots or doesnt make the movie sound ridiculous. So ridiculous in fact it achieves that rarest of qualities in our age of snark and knowingness unintended parody. For all the movies it aspires to be the one Country Strong most closely resembles is Mariah Careys infamous debacle Glitter. With Paltrows endless geysers of torment and hysterics the whos-zooming-who tangle of romantic intrigue and its hilariously dead-serious images of stardom (personal favorite Paltrows Kelly breaking down on a giant video screen as American flags unfurl to either side) Country Strong seems destined to become a Valley of the Dolls-like cult favorite.The performances - not just of Paltrow but also (even especially) Hedlund and Meester - create a viewing experience in which several great country music videos are contained within a sappy and hoot-filled feature-length movie. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Gwyneth Paltrow in a scene from ""Country Strong."" Movie review Country Strong Like its inspiration its not very deep Add to ... Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 07 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Director and writer Shana Feste has said that her new film Country Strong about an alcoholic country singer attempting a comeback was inspired by Britney Spears that victim of fame. But what is the Britney Spears story? Its not even a psychological drama let alone a classic tragedy - its just some tawdry tabloid soap opera. Feste struggles mightily to instill meaning and grandeur in Country Strong but her initial efforts to sidestep cliche often result in confusion before she simply gives up and opts for melodrama. Movies Country Strong The official trailer Celebrity The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining? Gwyneth Paltrow plays Kelly Canter a country singer who has fallen drunkenly off a stage and miscarried a five-month-old pregnancy. Now shes in rehab where she has fallen for songwriter and aspiring country singer Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund) who just happens to be an orderly in this padded prison. But husband and manager James (Tim McGraw) needs Kelly out on the comeback trail and springs her a month early. She insists that Beau be her opening act; James wants to give that spot to the seemingly talentless beauty queen Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester) but when he sees Beau rescue Chiles as she freezes on stage he incorporates them both into the show. The stage seems set for a rather obvious pair of infidelities with the older couple now hauling around a pair of young temptations. To give Feste her due she avoids that James keeps his hands off the beauty queen while Beau who initially despises Chiles gradually sees she is not as dumb as she pretends and begins a feisty seduction. But if Chiles isnt a pretty airhead who is she? Feste isnt really sure and Meester having produced the initial stereotype on cue is now left to mainly play nice. Similarly Feste is determined James will not be some villainous Svengali but the writer-director hasnt included enough scenes from his marriage for an audience to do more than vaguely sympathize with the man it must be exceedingly difficult to run a business in which your only asset is a wife with an erratic ego. McGraw does a lovely job of showing that James is still moved by his wife - the man does love her - but beyond that he has little with which to work and we are left to imagine what could have been the most penetrating scenes in the film. McGraw and Meester at least have character complications that they can hint at in their performances however confusingly. Hedlund is left to play Beau on a single note of heroic integrity Whether hes rescuing women or writing songs the boy is all gentleman. Its awfully sweet but the psychological premise has exhausted itself long before the movie is over. At Kellys final moment of on-stage triumph Feste is left cutting from a close-up of a towering Paltrow to Hedlunds ecstatically supportive grin and McGraws sadly supportive grin. She lamely repeats that series of shots before moving to the films melodramatic conclusion. Which brings us to Paltrow of course. First let it be said that Country Strong has a pleasant soundtrack of conservative country music many of the tunes newly written for the movie some of them performed by old pros and some of them performed by the cast. Yes Paltrow is plausible as a country singer if not perhaps as a country star. The problem is her spoken performance which does show us her pain and fear in life and her joy and affirmation on stage but in the end can never produce the scale - that Coal Miners Daughter emotional belt - that is going to make us feel this womans tragedy Beau tells Kelly that love and fame cant reside in the same place. Sadly this movie never explains why.

Gwyneth Paltrow stars in Country Strong. Photo Scott Garfield Country Strong 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Country Strong a tuneful if gloomy drama about crash-and-burn celebrity in the world of country music owes much of its plot toA Star Is BornandCrazy Heart- with bits ofThe Lost Weekendthrown in. But the one movie I couldnt get out of my head wasTron Legacy. Have you seen that? It has few human attractions to recommend it but it does offer Jeff Bridges in bare feet. Oh and a guy named Garrett Hedlund -- dull sort really. His perpetually peaked brow conveys one emotion noodle-headed arrogance and his line readings - well they suffice for a fellow marooned inside a video game. But nothing I repeat nothing prepared me for the rangy charisma and rumbling set of pipes he shows off in the mixed-bag Country Strong. The guy can sing. I mean sing. As Beau Hutton a Nashville up-and-comer who charms Kelly Canter (Gwyneth Paltrow) a vodka-swigging superstar-in-decline Hedlund huffs through songs with a craggy scooping bass that conjures Johnny Cash and suggests a musical career if this Hollywood thang doesnt pan out. The film itself tacks between morose and soapishly entertaining with a packet of able performances and lots of original music to offset a muddled script. But Hedlund is the big news here. Paltrow sings too. We already knew she could having witnessed her talents in everything from Duets to a recent episode of Glee. But because the movie tracks Kellys downfall not her rise she actually spends more time freaking out onstage - Paltrows work in these scenes is excruciatingly painful - than she does wowing the crowd with music. Outside one wistful scene with schoolchildren (the films most poignant by far) virtually all of her singing time is crammed into a single Texas concert three songs period. So dont come looking for a rousing deep-fried concert movie because this aint it. The casts one big-name star Tim McGraw plays Kellys controlling husband; he chews gum irritably and nips around in trim black suits but he doesnt sing until the closing credits. Gossip Girls Leighton Meester injects some bubbliness into the film as a sympathetic popster with Taylor Swift influences (and a backstory similar to her own) but otherwise Country Strong has grim business on its agenda. Writer-director Shana Feste also made The Greatest last years spotty family drama about teenage love and death. Country Strong has a bit more to recommend it - the music most of all - but its still a tough slog through emotional swamplands and Festes screenplay doesnt do us many favors. Its murky when it needs to be clear (Beaus exact relationship with Kelly) and obvious when it ought to be subtle (a singer named ... Canter Of course). The introduction of a baby quail into the storyline does not bode well for Kelly whose fragility is telegraphed loudly from start to finish. Paltrow wrangles with a fake Southern accent. Hedlund doesnt bother not when hes talking content to let his scraggly beard and slouchy magnetism do all the work. Hes the best thing going in Country Strong. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals ""Decision Making for Dummies"" eBook for free Fruit of the Loom Mens Boxer Briefs 8-Pack for 12 + pickup...

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Country Strong? Talk about a title scam job. This lame-ass chick-flick sampling of Crazy Heart is more like country Kryptonite. The cast led by Gwyneth Paltow as broken-down Nashville queen Kelly Canter is sucked dry of any juice by Shana Feste whose script is laughably inauthentic and whose direction marshals cliches as if they were freshly minted. Kelly is just out of a too-short rehab after a spectacular onstage crackup in Dallas where she drunkenly falls off the stage suffers a miscarriage and ruins whats left of her marriage to manager James (Tim McGraw). Now hubby has scheduled a three-stop Texas comeback tour ending back in Dallas. You fill in the blanks. Youd surely do a better a job than this misbegotten movie.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews Country Strong in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers."" I could tell you how Kelly brings along studly singer-songwriter Beau Hutton (Tron Legacys Garrett Hedlund) the orderly shes been banging in rehab. And how James fills the bill by adding his young protege Chiles Stanton (Gossip Girls Leighton Meester) a former beauty queen with a clear and present stage fright. But Im dozing just writing this. The dialogue could sink Streep. Kelly tells Beau that ""love and fame cant live in the same place."" And she advises Chiles not to take laxatives before a show because ""they never work the way you think they will."" Im still pondering that one. The 10 Best Movies of 2010 Paltrow made a spectacular impression this season on Glee playing a substitute teacher gone wild and performing Cee Los ""Forget You."" But she drowns in this country goo. All the actors sing with Auto-Tuned abandon except for McGraw who doesnt sing at all. Thats right the one genuine country artist (with 11 consecutive Number One albums) is silenced which shows you why they should have called this mess Country Wrong. In only her second film following The Greatest Feste might as well be warbling McGraws ""Cant Tell Me Nothin"" so misplaced is her confidence. McGraw scores the best revenge by giving the films only subtle and moving performance. After this and The Blind Side and Friday Night Lights Faith Hills hit-making hubby earns an acting future.

Between concerts romantic entanglements and old demons threaten to derail them all. Starring Gwyneth Paltrow Leighton Meester Garrett Hedlund Tim McGraw Kayla Perkins Sean Symons Jim ORear Jeremy Childs Ed Bruce Vernon Mitchell Director Shana Feste Running time 152 Release Opened Jan 7 2011  Editorial Review The bland ole soap opryBy Jen ChaneyFriday January 7 2010See Gwyneth Paltrow start sobbing onstage in the middle of a song. See Gwyneth Paltrow have another emotional breakdown in a bathroom stall. See Gwyneth Paltrow totally lose it again in the shower of an RV after one of her precious bottles of booze gets smashed into tiny shards. That may be a gross oversimplification of what happens in ""Country Strong"" the story of a Nashville diva (Paltrow) attempting to relaunch her career after a very public stint in rehab. But its an accurate description of how it feels to watch this disjointed drama filled with one-dimensional characters and melodrama so Lifetime movie-esque that it careens into unintentional comedy. Paltrow under-served by the material at almost every turn pours every drop of twang and tears she has into the role of Kelly Canter a country star of the couture-meets-cowboy-boots variety whose drinking problem has led to a disastrous stage fall a terminated pregnancy a rupture in her marriage to manager James (Tim McGraw) and that aforementioned decision to seek treatment for alcoholism. But now at least in her husbands eyes shes all better and ready to get back on the road for a trio of high-profile comeback dates. Of course she aint goin nowhere without scruffy-hot singer-songwriter Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund) whom she um befriended in rehab. Meanwhile James wont put Kelly onstage unless Chiles Stanton (""Gossip Girls"" Leighton Meester) a perky beauty queen who dreams of being the next Carrie Underwood is an opening act. And with that the stage is set for soap opera-ish romantic entanglements jealous spats the swilling of vodka straight from the bottle and performances of pleasant country tunes that are just generic enough to ensure theyll be completely forgotten until you hear them while waiting to have your teeth cleaned. Writer-director Shana Feste who made her major motion picture debut with 2009s loss-of-a-child drama ""The Greatest"" should have let this be Paltrows movie. With tighter direction and a stronger script - one that didnt force Paltrow to say things like ""Ive never lived on a star but it sure looks like fun"" - this could have been an unflinchingly honest portrait of how fame and addiction transformed the once brassy ""Belle of Bristol Tennessee"" into a fragile bird of a human being one who lest you miss the point actually carries around a fragile baby quail in a box. (Dont ask.) Instead its just a lot of histrionics set to a jangly soundtrack. Paltrow isnt in the spotlight enough because Feste focuses much of her attention on Beau and Chiles who exude a certain charm thanks to Hedlund and Meester but arent complex or interesting enough to carry so much of the movie. The camera makes a particular point of luxuriating on Hedlunds easy grin and the cowboy twinkle in his eye practically daring the audience not to find him dead sexy. (By the third time Hedlund croons ""Im gonna wear you down"" the opening line of the films oft-repeated love song ""Give In to Me"" its clear he has made good on that promise.) Given the similarity of the subject matter its almost impossible not to compare ""Country Strong"" to ""Crazy Heart"" the study of hard-drinking country musician Bad Blake that earned Jeff Bridges an Academy Award last year. Where that film was all indie grit and guitar blisters this one is all pop sheen and lip gloss. ""Crazy Heart"" wasnt perfect but it rang true while ""Country Strong"" rarely does. To put it another way when Kelly Canter has a few too many before an important gig she wobbles backstage and barfs daintily into a trash can while Blair from ""Gossip Girl"" helpfully holds her long blond hair. But when Bad Blake knocks back a few before a show? He still goes onstage then walks off mid-set throws up next to a dumpster in an alley shakes it off and regains his place at the mike. Now thats country strong.Contains scenes of a mild sexual nature and thematic elements involving alcohol abuse.

Photo Patsy Cline. Loretta Lynn. Gwyneth Paltrow. If you buy that progression youll buy ""Country Strong"" an unintentionally campy drama in which Paltrow as broken-down country superstar Kelly Canter -- a singer so popular she has a logo -- rambles forth waving empty Smirnoff bottles and smearing her mascara. Emerging from rehab Kelly has undergone a vaguely defined trauma that isnt fully explained till the end (which doesnt save it from sounding absurd). An orderly at her clinic an aspiring country singer named Beau (Garrett Hedlund of ""Tron Legacy"") has been helping her get sober mostly by helping her get horizontal. Despite catching the two of them eye-bonking each other in the clinic her manager husband (Tim McGraw) invites Beau to come along as an opening act for her comeback tour. To stir the pot and because superstars have such a hard time finding opening acts he also brings a nervous little amateur Chiles Stanton (an adorable Leighton Meester). She wants to be the next Carrie Underwood though she hasnt yet mastered the skill of singing in public without freaking out. PHOTOS GOSSIP GIRLS amp; BOYS ON THE BIG SCREEN VIDEO NOT SO COUNTRY The movie starts out well enough mainly because it relies heavily on a series of convincing country songs and Meester out-acts Paltrow by nailing the calculated sweetness of her character. Shes a girl who when you call her ""Country Barbie"" says ""Thank you"" and means it. But its hard to buy Paltrow as a product of Pigslop Texas who says things like ""I aint never had a man be so gennull with me."" This isnt ""Crazy Heart."" The ""dramatic"" scenes are hilarious. I tried not to laugh when Paltrow wallows stricken on her hotel bed in a fur coat listening to Patsy Cline or empties her guts into a trash barrel. But I failed. Maybe Sandra Bullock with a better director could have pulled this off. But Gwyneth with her steely abs does not look like shes been through the wringer. She looks like she doesnt even know where the wringer is and would have to check with the maid to find out. Writer-director Shana Feste who last year did the woeful family drama ""The Greatest"" has only an approximate sense of country ways showing Kelly joyriding on the boxcar of a freight train. I cant quite picture Shania Twain or Faith Hill doing that except in a music video but then again no one has done it since about 1937. Feste also thinks country means daddys in prison (Chiles seems to be the offspring of two hardened criminals) and that in the interest of keeping it real youre really better off doing true-country in front of a crowd of several rather than putting on makeup and making hit records. Love and fame goes the moral cant live in the same place. But lots of famous people have successful marriages from Bono to Leno. ""Country Strong"" merely shows that love and severe alcoholism have irreconcilable differences. We knew that Loretta Lynn told us so in ""Dont Come Home A-Drinkin (With Lovin on Your Mind)."" Not that theres a lot of love in the movie except in speeches. At times Kelly seems attached to her lightly sinister husband but mostly theyre cool to each other. The hubby shrugs it off when he sees her walk out of Beaus hotel room wearing only a towel (instead of her clothes which shes carrying). Later he slugs Beau -- so is he jealous or not? If so why did he invite Beau on tour? Is he more interested in little Chiles -- Kelly 2.0? And why doesnt Kelly -- or her husband -- seem jealous when Chiles and Beau start to make like Johnny Cash and June Carter together? Maybe no one really cares about anyone which is why they say things like ""Maybe we should stop this -- youre married already you know?"" This is supposed to be a country movie. Shouldnt somebody say something like ""I cant take your body if your hearts not in it""? kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Hot picks Read Next Hot picks Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16059 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Country Strong (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Country Strong (PG-13) Gwyneth Paltrow is miscast but the songs shine in this story about the country music industry. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald1/7/2011 Editor rating 2 Gwyneth Paltrow is a beautiful gifted actress with a lovely singing voice but shes never been more miscast than she is in Country Strong. She plays Kelly Canter a self-destructive country-music superstar who is just getting out of rehab after a career-wrecking performance in Dallas where she fell off the stage drunk and five months pregnant and suffered a miscarriage. Keeping this catastrophe off-screen is one of the few wise decisions made by writer-director Shana Feste (The Greatest) who apparently is equally a fan of All About Eve and Valley of the Dolls. As written Kelly should be a tormented guilt-stricken performer trying to regain her confidence while struggling with the demons of addiction. But Paltrow plays her as a weepy whiner in need of serious therapy and non-smearing mascara. Kelly coos over a rescued baby bird she keeps in a box and freaks out when someone mails her a grotesque doll smeared in red with the note ""Baby Killer"" Her husband/manager James (Tim McGraw) puts up with her erratic behavior and ladles on the ""You can do it baby"" speeches even though hes aware Kelly got a little closer than necessary to her rehab sponsor Beau (Garrett Hedlund). Beau coincidentally is an aspiring country singer and joins the opening act of Kellys comeback tour along with Chiles (Leighton Meester) a former beauty queen afflicted by stage fright. Everyone takes turns singing onstage and sleeping with each other (except for McGraw who does neither; talk about drawing the short straw). Will Beau press on and wreck Kellys marriage or will he opt for the pretty more age-appropriate Chiles? Will Kelly get her act together before their tour returns to Dallas where everything fell apart? Will anyone remember to feed that little bird left forgotten for troubling stretches of screen time? The only things that keep Country Strong from being an outright disaster -- that makes the movie watchable really -- are the insanely catchy songs performed by the cast all of whom did their own singing. The movie constantly cuts away after the tunes first chorus which is frustrating but the snippets you do get to hear are terrific making you wish Country Strong would set the backstage histrionics aside and put the music front and center the way Crazy Heart did. Paltrows singing voice is clear and strong but her performances during the concert sequences are awkward she looks more like a supermodel strutting down the runway than a musician. That stiffness extends to her work through the rest of the movie too. In Country Strong the Oscar-winning Paltrow gets upstaged and outacted by the kid from Tron and the snotty brat from Gossip Girl. Whod have thought? Cast Gwyneth Paltrow Tim McGraw Garrett Hedlund Leighton Meester. Writer-director Shana Feste. Producers Jenno Topping Tobey Maguire. A Screen Gems studios release. Running time 118 minutes. Vulgar language sexual situations. Playing at area theaters.

"Country Strong | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; country-strong ) Country Strong (United States 2010) January 06 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli If one was to judge Country Strong based solely on its misleading trailer one might assume this to be a clichA(c)-riddled Crazy Heart wannabe. And although I will not argue that the whole cloth from which the story has been cut contains its fair share of familiar and/or overused situations the narrative is surprisingly engaging the character relationships contain aspects of complexity and the ending does not give in to the temptation to be too facile. Like the country songs that form its foundation Country Strong is a downer. While the melodrama is ladled on fast and thick at times it is performed with sufficient conviction that we are drawn in rather than left on the outside laughing at it. (Consider Burlesque for an example of the latter.) The storyline which suffers from a diffuse focus centers on up-and-coming country singer Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund) who has become the lover of six-time Grammy superstar Kelly Canter (Gwyneth Paltrow) during her stay in rehab. Beau is not desirous of fame or fortune; hes content writing his songs in obscurity and singing them in bars. Big stages and big crowds are not his dream. The same cannot be said of Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester) a former beauty pageant queen with a big voice but an unfortunate tendency to freeze under pressure or when faced with a room full of people. She and Beau are reluctantly teamed by James Canter (Tim McGraw) Kellys domineering husband/manager who is looking for an opening act for his wifes comeback tour. He assigns Beau to be Kellys ""keeper"" while deciding to take Chiles under his wing and groom her ascent to stardom. Complications arise when Beau falls for Chiles and Kelly proves too unstable to keep it together for a full show - something that leads to her inevitable return to the bottle. There are plenty of things to nit-pick about Country Strong including its naA-ve and dated view of alcoholism which is treated more as a plot device than a debilitating disease. However writer/director Shana Feste (The Greatest) approaches her characters and storyline with respect and sincerity. She resists the temptation to turn any of them into saints or demons. The villains shades of gray are merely a little darker than those of the heroes. Theres also a fascinating duality to be noted. Those who view Country Strong as Kellys story will see it as a tragedy. Those who see it as Beaus will find something positive and uplifting. Since most viewers will identify equally with both characters the emotional end balance is mixed. The casting is odd. From an acting standpoint Gwyneth Paltrow could pull off this role in her sleep which sometimes seems to be the case. This is an adequate performance but nothing more. Melodrama like this is often aided by high voltage portrayals; Paltrow underplays the part. Her voice which we previously heard in the 2000 offering Duets (where she was paired with Huey Lewis) is solid but not superlative - although in todays music industry shes at least as good as a majority of Top 10 singers. Garrett Hedlund (who made this film immediately after getting digital for TRON Legacy) and Leighton Meester (who dabbles in singing) are photogenic and convincing (if not Oscar material) as singers and actors. Curiously the only bona fide country star in the movie Tim McGraw confines his performance to the spoken word. Ultimately Country Strong has it where it counts which means it can generate an effective emotional response without making the viewer feel like he or she is being pulled through a manipulative meat grinder. Theres a fair amount of ambiguity in the relationships especially in how Beau is torn between the woman he idolizes and protects and the one with whom he connects in a more primal way. And James layers are peeled back gradually revealing depth beyond the apparent one-dimensionality with which he is introduced. Calling Country Strong ""subtle"" is a stretch but it evidences more breadth than one might suspect based on the misleading marketing campaign which hints at a triumphant comeback and a rivalry between Kelly and Chiles. Oh and I suspect country music fans will love the film since it wades hip-deep through the rivers of the genre and rarely comes up for a breather.

"Movie Review Country Strong all wrong | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie Review Country Strong all wrongIf theres a Nashville cliche missing from Country Strong its not for want of trying.Gwyneth Paltrow is shown in a scene from Country Strong.  (Scott Garfield / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 6 2011 Country Strong (out of 4) Starring Gwyneth Paltrow Tim McGraw Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester. Written and directed by Shana Feste. At major theatres. PG Years of painful observation have taught me that its easier to make an actor into a pop singer than a pop singer into an actor (Im looking at you Mick Jagger). Theres something about the poppers need to tear down the walls and rip up the joint that rarely translates to the subtle medium of film. Now along comes Country Strong to prove my theory wrong times two. It attempts to make pop twangers out of actors Gwyneth Paltrow and Garrett Hedlund and serious thespians out of crooner Tim McGraw and singer/actor Leighton Meester (TVs Gossip Girl) and it succeeds only with the second half of the round-up. Much has been made of ice-queen Paltrows conversion to country siren by way of a few warbles that suggests shes really a hayseed at heart. But theres scant sonic evidence to prove it all of her numbers in Country Strong including the title tune are reduced to brief snippets often drowned out by her band or the roar of crowd-for-hire. Paltrows Kelly Canter is more karaoke than country but to be fair its not entirely her fault. The many tunes in Country Strong are of such astounding banality its as if they were written by caged chimps as they were driven through Nashville on the way to a medical research lab. Not even Patsy Cline the woman Paltrow is desperately channeling could make something out of these ditties I reckon. Nor could anyone redeem the insipid script and stumbling direction by Shana Feste who steps into more cow pies than a rodeo clown. If theres a Nashville cliche missing from Country Strong its not for want of trying. Feste concocts melodramatic mush where the partners change more often than at a square dance. Paltrows Kelly is a hurtin drinkin and cheatin fool who met her personal grassy knoll in Dallas after she drunkenly tumbled from a stage causing her to miscarry her unborn child. She was shipped to rehab under the care of the boyish Beau (Hedlund) whose job appears to be a cross between personal nurse janitor and boy toy. When hes not mopping floors or messin with Kelly he moonlights as a singer-songwriter preferring to play only small clubs instead of stadiums because you know hes singing for the people not for money. The stadium offers come because Beau is reputed to be talented but once again the horse aint in the barn. Hedlund was okay as the scrappy kid in Tron Legacy but hes hopeless at anything requiring greater nuance. His constant smirk makes him look perpetually stoned. Beau runs afoul of Kellys manager-hubby James (McGraw) who loves his wife but loves her bank account even more and also budding songbird Chiles (Meester) whom James is grooming to open for Kellys comeback tour. Which is gonna happen dont you know once Kelly works out her personal demons gets right with Jesus and finds a home for that tiny baby quail that she keeps in a cigar box to remind her of things that really matter in life. Things like Brazilian bikini waxes which Kelly gets to spark some bedroom interest from James her own personal SpongeBob Squarepants. ""I just took an Ambien"" James shrugs. So did the rest of the picture which never busts out of its soap opera corral. The only characters of any conviction are the ones played by McGraw and Meester and thats saying something given the wretched dialogue. This not only takes my singers-cant-act thesis to the woodshed it also suggests that these two have a future in better movies than this. As for Paltrow youd think shed have learned from the debacle of Duets the other singing movie that she made a decade ago. Is it time to make Iron Man 3 yet?

"Country Strong review Paltrows too-serious musical just misses becoming a camp classic |       NJ.com comments Country Strong review Paltrows too-serious musical just misses becoming a camp classic Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 07 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments Scott Garfield Gwyneth Paltrow stars in ""Country Strong"" as an alcoholic country singer. Some movies are great and dont know it and thats always an endearing and slightly bittersweet surprise. Some movies are bad and know it and make you complicitous in their own delightful awfulness. But other movies are bad and dont know it. In fact they think theyre great. And thats just annoying. Case in point ""Country Strong"" a big musical drama with Gwyneth Paltrow as a fresh-from-rehab singer falling apart on the comeback trail. Full of self-regard the picture even played Los Angeles last month in order to qualify for possible Academy Awards. Confidence is a lovely thing. Sometimes. But ""Country Strong"" sadly includes everything on the best-actress checklist except a performance -- unless you consider two hours of Paltrow alternating between drunken crying jags and wan country warbling something more than a privileged star showing off. Whats a real shame is that theres a truly bad movie in here that you wish director Shana Feste had surrendered to -- the sort of over-the-top melodrama that Susan Hayward used to make and camp cultists such as John Waters and Charles Busch used to burlesque. Movie Review Country Strong ((PG-13) Screen Gems (112 min.) Directed by Shana Feste. With Gwyneth Paltrow Garrett Hedlund. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains alcohol abuse sexual situations and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS I mean a country star who miscarried when she fell off the stage in a drunken stupor? And now coos to an orphaned baby bird she carries around in a cigar box? When shes not knocking Tony Lamas with her cute male nurse from the rehab center? A cute male nurse whos a great singer-songwriter of course and who our star adds to her comeback tour much to the annoyance of her husband. Who has his own little up-and-comer he wants to bring along. Who is sleeping with him and with the musical nurse. Euclid couldnt imagine such triangles. Its hard for me though to imagine anyone taking this seriously -- really this is the stuff of drag revues. But unfortunately director Shana Feste simply adores screenwriter Shana Feste. And so every ridiculous character gets a close-up and every absurd scene gets its full weight as they all keep on a-fussin and a-fightin. Scott Garfield After Chiless (Leighton Meester left) series of embarrassing false starts Beau (Garrett Hedlund center)surprises her on stage for a rousing duet in ""Country Strong."" It is meant to be a joke isnt it? Isnt it? If it is no ones told the director or her stars. Paltrow has one or two genuine moments but she never convinces as a beloved country legend (her band often drowns her out). Garrett Hedlund is better than he was in ""Tron Legacy"" -- not difficult -- but his character makes no sense. And meanwhile Tim McGraw -- the one cast member who can sing -- is never given a number. The penultimate sequence -- with all the supporting characters looking on in misty-eyed wonder while Paltrow sings a few songs -- is both cringe-worthy and the key to the whole enterprise. Look at her it screams. Look at her. Isnt she wonderful? Well yes sometimes. But not here. Not now. And not in a movie that isnt smart enough to realize how stupid it really is.

Scott Garfield Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Country Strong"" (Screen Gems) Actress Gwyneth Paltrows unique promotion of ""Country Strong"" -- singing the title track live on the CMA Awards last year well in advance of the movies opening -- makes sense now.""Country Strong"" in which Paltrow plays a fantastically messed up country music superstar needs all the positive press it can get to detract from the fact that its little more than an achy breaky soap opera that lucked out by casting an A-list Oscar winner.Paltrow plays Kelly Canter a Grammy-winning singer in rehab for a DWI arrest and with a past that includes famously falling off a stage drunk and pregnant. In rehab she meets Beau (Garrett Hedlund ""TRON Legacy"") a budding musician making ends meet working at the facility. Their chemistry is obvious.Enter Kellys manager-husband James (country star Tim McGraw in a nonsinging role) who springs Kelly from rehab way too early so she can get back on the road on a comeback tour.Kelly wants Beau to join her on the road as her opening act but James wants doe-eyed newbie Chiles (Leighton Meester) to tour with his wife. James agrees to test them both in front of a live audience at a saloon where Chiles freezes only for Beau to pick up the pieces. The three tour together but romantic complications develop backstage.None of this helps Kelly who hits the stage boozing and drugging and crashing and burning during a comeback show her handlers try to spin as a food-poisoning incident. The melodrama in ""Country Strong"" is in full swing as director Shana Feste tries balancing Kellys worlds into a cohesive warts-and-all music drama. But the film doesnt come close to matching any of the legion of films set in the country music world from ""Coal Miners Daughter"" to ""Walk the Line"" to ""Crazy Heart.""Paltrow comes off as a trouper and handles her vocals admirably (along with Hedlund and Meester who reportedly did all their singing).But she still is merely slumming a long way from ""Shakespeare in Love."" Wallowing in B-movie regularity ""Country Strong"" isnt juicy enough or serious enough to leave a lasting impression save for the nagging question of what Paltrow is doing here.

By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 7 2011 1201 a.m. ET A reliable distinction can be drawn between movies that arent shown at all prior to their Friday opening--studios and distributors usually know when theyve got a total disaster on their hands--and those that arent unveiled until Wednesday so that bad reviews and poisonous buzz wont destroy their first weekend at the box office. A finer distinction can be drawn between movies that are previewed on Wednesday evening (disastrousness almost guaranteed) and movies that are first screened on Wednesday afternoon (probably awful but you never know). ""Season of the Witch"" was screened in Los Angeles at 2 p.m. on Wednesday but it should have been shown around 6 or 7. ENLARGE Nicolas Cage as a Crusader with occult troubles in Season of the Witch. Relativity Media As Crusader knights during the Dark Ages Nicolas Cage (in full frown mode) and Ron Perlman (loved him as ""Hellboy"") fight computer-generated hordes lose faith in their cause and return to a Europe that has been afflicted by the plague--not the standard Black variety but an even more pestilential strain that may have been caused by witchcraft. To end the curse they must take an accused witch (shes played unbewitchingly by Claire Foy) to be exorcised in a faraway monastery. In the course of their journey they slay digital wolves and encounter popeyed suppurating corpses that help the filmmakers avoid any accusation of light-heartedness. (Though its nice for horror-film buffs that Christopher Lee does a cameo as a grotesquely disfigured cardinal on the verge of death.) The nonsense is not without its rewards. The best line belongs to an earnest priest played by Stephen Campbell Moore. In the midst of an exorcism thats lurid enough to approach certifiable looniness the priest cries ""Were going to need some more holy water"" This film should not be confused with George A. Romeros 1972 horror flick of the same name or Ingmar Bergmans ""The Seventh Seal"" in which a Crusader knight returning with his squire to plague-ravaged Sweden plays chess with Death. Mr. Cages knight ends up playing second banana to a digital devil. Welcome to the January dead zone. Country Strong Watch a clip from ""Country Strong"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw. Gwyneth Paltrow deserves better than the cliches that bedevil ""Country Strong"" which was written and directed by Shana Feste. She plays--and sings--Kelly Canter a fragile country-music legend plucked out of rehab prematurely by her greedy husband/manager James (Tim McGraw). Kellys only support in the outside world comes from Beau a sensitive guy who worked at her rehab clinic and happens to be a talented singer and guitarist. Hes played by Garrett Hedlund (most recently of ""Tron Legacy"") who is consistently likable despite his trying to be. Mr. Hedlund and Ms. Paltrow are at their intimate best in their very first scene stretched out on a bed and trying to do nothing more than work out the lyrics of a new song. The film works best when the music takes over. Its star sings well and looks lovely even when Kelly is supposed to look wasted. But the intimacy soon vanishes and the star gets crowded out of the picture from time to time by a cluttered unfocused plot that involves not just the triangle of Kelly James and Beau but a quadrangle created by the presence of Leighton Meesters Chiles an ambitious beauty queen turned up-and-coming singer in the hoary tradition of ""All About Eve."" (Ms. Meester gives an accomplished performance thats limited only by the lack of nuance in the script.) ENLARGE Gwyneth Paltrow as a singer on the rebound from addiction in Country Strong. Screen Gems ""Country Strong"" comes to spontaneous life from time to time despite maudlin devices (a wounded quail chick that Kelly carries around in a little box) and manipulative set pieces (Kelly singing to a young cancer victim is not as charming as its meant to be). More often than not though the movie observes behavior instead of revealing feelings. The most telling example occurs in a scene when Kelly struggling with her demons at every step takes the stage for her climactic concert kisses the crucifix she wears on a necklace and waits in anxious silence for the music to begin. At the instant it does the camera is back where the audience sits watching her rise in statuesque grandeur instead of on her face capturing the moment of her transformation.  Watch a clip from ""Offside"" by Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi. Movies can move audiences--and threaten governments--in ways that we Americans have either forgotten or havent known. Late last month an Iranian court sentenced two of Irans finest filmmakers Jafar Panahi and Mahmoud Rasoulof to six years in prison and banned them from making films writing scripts traveling abroad or giving interviews for 20 years. The charge was ""colluding in gatherings and making propaganda against the regime."" By lashing out against these artists the regime revealed itself to be more fearful and contemptible than its harshest critics might have contended. Fortunately the offending films can still be seen not just in the free world but in Iran where bootleg DVDs circumvent official censorship. ENLARGE Jafar Panahi in August Agence France-Presse/Getty Images When I reviewed Mr. Panahis ""The Circle"" a decade ago I wrote that ""in some parts of the world making feature films can still be a heroic enterprise."" The film (in Farsi with English subtitles and available new or used for purchase through Amazon.com) is a stunning drama about the desperate state of women in Iran. It begins with a blessed event thats immediately blighted by blind prejudice. A newborn baby certified by ultrasounds to be a boy turns out to be a girl which means the in-laws will demand a divorce. Thats shocking enough but its only a preface to fragmentary portraits of women as they had never been seen before in Iranian cinema. Watch a clip from Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof. The directors 2006 comedy ""Offside"" (Im confining these capsule descriptions to films that American movie lovers can either buy or rent on Netflix) also concerns the plight of Iranian women--those who happen to be soccer fans but who are excluded from the nations stadiums even though they may be equal to Iranian men in their passion for the sport. While the films subversions are delicate and entertaining its subjects are perfectly clear the hypocrisy of discrimination and the stupidity of authority. ENLARGE Mahmoud Rasoulof in 2009 Agence France-Presse/Getty Images ENLARGE Hossein Farzi-Zadeh in Mr. Rasoulofs Iron Island. Kino International/Everett Collection Mr. Rasoulofs ""Iron Island"" (a Netflix rental) sees the ship of state as a rotting sinking hulk. ""Titanic"" its not but this richly detailed--and improbably enjoyable--allegory is set aboard an abandoned oil tanker anchored in the Persian Gulf. The giant rust bucket serves as home--as a village really--to hundreds of people plus their goats and several donkeys. Theyve entrusted their fate to Captain Nemat (as in Nemo) a chief of state who is by turns a kindly buffoon a not-so-benevolent despot and a visionary who wants to find his followers a home on dry land. The floating village is made up mostly of Sunni Muslim Arabs a small minority in Iran so the films political content is less volatile than it may seem. Nevertheless ""Iron Island"" gives us startling images of a miniregime at odds with itself and of a community struggling like so many others to get from one day to the next. Its resources include a telephone company (i.e. a kid with a cell phone seated behind a porthole) and--subversion of subversions--a teacher who thinks his students should be taught the truth.

(Garfield/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 6 2011 329 PM Title Country Strong An alcoholic singer goes back on the road. With Gwyneth Paltrow Tim McGraw Leighton Meester. Director Shana Feste (152). PG-13 Substance abuse sexuality. At area theaters.There are so many stark choices to be made among the characters in ""Country Strong."" Do they drink or stay sober? Pursue love or fame? Worship Townes Van Zandt or Carrie Underwood?No one ever realizes balance is an option -- and thats because it never occurs to writer/director Shana Feste either.Festes debut the melodramatic indie ""The Greatest"" suffered from a similar inability to locate middle ground. But this time at least she has some crucial advantages. For one thing the wild highs and deep-down lows suit the country music setting and for another shes blessed with a fully committed cast.Gwyneth Paltrow has the toughest job and therefore delivers the most impressive performance as Nashville superstar Kelly Canter. After several drunken episodes led to tragic consequences a shamed and grieving Kelly retreated to rehab. But her manager husband James (Tim McGraw) is more concerned with rehabilitating her image. So he pulls Kelly out early packaging a heavily promoted tour that also includes up-and-comers Beau (Garrett Hedlund) and Chiles (Leighton Meester).Its immediately clear to everyone however that Kelly -- attracted to Beau and threatened by Chiles -- is not remotely ready for a comeback of any kind.What saves ""Country Strong"" from drowning in its own tears are the leads all four of whom imbue Festes unabashedly cliched script with some genuine humanity. Even the soapiest moments are played with relatively understated calm which goes a long way toward undercutting the scripts self-importance. (Please screenwriters Lets never see another symbolic bird onscreen again okay?)The music suffers from a similar conflict; the actors have decent voices and the songs do accurately mimic slick country pop. But while there is nothing special about them they are presented with a seriousness that invites more mockery than respect.While Feste has improved as a director she might want to consider a collaborator next time someone to help shade her exaggerated tones. Not everyone can be a solo artist and there is no shame in sharing a stage.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

""Country Strong"" drags out its tedious show-business melodrama to an indefensible two hours. Often one hears of messed-up movies where miles of footage wound up on the cutting-room floor. In the case of ""Country Strong"" too much remained on the reel. The film is bolted together out of bits and pieces of old backstage musicals. It seems not so much written as assembled from a do-it-yourself kit. Gwyneth Paltrow is Kelly a sputtering vodka-soaked superstar looking for a big comeback. A year earlier she stumbled dead drunk off a Dallas stage derailing her career and miscarrying her child. Actual country idol Tim McGraw does a non-singing turn as James Kellys supportive but opportunistic husband/manager. ""Tron"" biker boy Garrett Hedlund is Beau a sweet-singin honky-tonk hunk. ""Gossip Girls"" Leighton Meester is Chiles a ""country Barbie"" beauty queen with her eye on Kellys spotlight. The women and men have designs on each other for personal enjoyment or career gains but writer/director Shana Festes garbled film makes it difficult to care who comes out ahead. When Beau and Chiles wind up as Kellys opening acts on her comeback tour the crosscurrents of distrust jealousy and lust ought to clash in a way that raises the emotional stakes. Instead the characters strike up fleeting alliances of convenience that are reshuffled with each new chapter of the story. The dramatic beats are as predictable as 10-gallon hats and big belt buckles at a Toby Keith concert. Add to this Festes Screenplay 101 grasp of metaphor -- Kellys fragile nature is embodied by the wounded bird she finds on the grounds of her rehab clinic and carries ever after in a cigar box -- and viewing the film becomes sheer drudgery. If it were a book youd have to force yourself to finish it. Paltrow an Oscar winner who has never found a worthy star vehicle clearly was drawn to the film as a showcase for her singing and acting talents which are considerable. But ""Country Strong"" serves her poorly with hackneyed scenes of mascara-smudging breakdowns boozy debauches glitz-a-rama concert numbers and a brazenly manipulative one-to-one performance for a Make-A-Wish cancer kid. Theres even a scene where she is supposed to upchuck in a garbage can which may be the most singularly unconvincing moment in Paltrows career. Feste also wrote and directed 2009s Pierce Brosnan dead child tearjerker ""The Greatest"" (it wasnt). She didnt have much to backslide from but she managed. ""Country Strong"" is awfully weak.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Country Strong is a title that calls to mind a pickup truck. Only in a work of science-fiction would it suffice as a description of Gwyneth Paltrow. In reality such a woman would be Gretchen Wilson. But without a trace of self-doubt Paltrow gives us brief unanticipated visions of Ford Super Duties and Toyota Tundras. She plays Kelly Canter a major country-music star with six Grammys and a serious drinking problem. If Faith Hill were one of the partiers on just about any reality show she might be Kelly Canter.Pushing her words together until they produce a honeyed Texas drawl Paltrow makes the part look natural. Shes not impersonating an actual singer so she seems merely like a twangy alcoholic version of herself. She should be stopped from dancing in enormous arenas but her thin voice is rather pretty even in songs with such lyrics as ""If you got it flaunt it/ Make the cowboys want it.When a fit of relapse sends her braying atop the bar of a dive spot or teary remorse for other misdeeds stains her face with mascara and eyeliner Paltrow manages to leave a few stops unpulled. But this peculiar movie written and directed by Shana Feste doesnt know what to think about Kelly or what to do with her. First the tabloids insist shes crazy. Then the movie joins in having its heroine insist whenever she can that shes sane. By the time the film reaches the most absurd and least earned of its many conclusions (if ""Country Strong ends once it ends nine times) its fair to assume that Feste has mistaken her protagonist for Lindsay Lohan or Courtney Love.The film is essentially the story of Kellys first tour since a boozy stage fiasco when she was five months pregnant. Her husband and manager James (Tim McGraw Mr. Faith Hill) pulls her prematurely out of rehab and puts her back on the road. He hires two opening acts. One happens to be Kellys sponsor Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund) who also happens to be Kellys lover and happens to think that this is all too much too soon for her. Leighton Meester plays the other act a squeaky clean beauty queen and aspiring star named Chiles Stanton which are the two best consecutive words in Festes screenplay.The first few shows are train wrecks. Kelly is either blinkered or AWOL. The problem with her low is that weve never seen her at her professional best. We know shes in rough shape now but we need to know what the fuss is all about. Are there no music videos Republican National Convention performances or ""Sunday Night Football intros to show us her brilliance? And is a woman purported to be this much of a mess really fit to give advice that sounds as sensible and insightful as hers does? She might be three or four different people after all. A lot of the Canters antics feel like showbiz-marriage cliches in which two people spend years taking advantage of each other. The cliches arent a crime but Feste applies no psychological depth or simple perception to any of these relationships. Its a movie that couldve been made by a gossip blog. To that end the filmmakers best idea is to have her four characters spinning in and out of each others arms.James may have a thing for Chiles and we already know how Kelly and Beau feel about each other. But Beau merely pretends to dislike Chiles whos so virginal wide-eyed and star-struck that shed accept an invitation to the hotel suite of any of the other three. That the movie doesnt culminate with a scene of these four pawing at each on a king bed constitutes a perverse moral failure. But when Kelly is nastily drunk and bitter about how drinking cost her a child she suggests that Feste missed an opportunity to make ""Whos Afraid of Shania Twain?McGraw is no Richard Burton. But he lends the proceedings the sort of authenticity needed for any country-music drama starring the wife of the guy from Coldplay. And the long mostly silent woman by Kellys side for many scenes is the singer and songwriter Marshall Chapman. Feste adds more risible stabs at credibility. Before she goes on stage Kelly opens a gift from celebrity well-wishers including someone named ""Emmylou. And one review swears that Beau is the next Townes Van Zandt. Yet to be fair Hedlund makes a case for himself as the kind of sex symbol that failed to materialize in all his stunt work in the current ""Tron sequel. Like Paltrow and Meester he does his own singing. And his voice has a smokers depth. When he sings a cluster of veins spreads like Old-Testament ivy around his Adams apple. The effort he makes to achieve the virility missing at the moment from young American movie actors is almost touching.But Meester is the best thing in the movie. Shes just doing Reese Witherspoons June Carter Cash in ""Walk the Line with dabs of Miley Cyrus and Kellie Pickler. But its not an impersonation; its a performance with its own comedy and sweetness. Kelly Canter has seven platinum records. Chiles Stanton says she has seven different smiles. Come the movies embarrassing climactic stab at tragedy you regret that ""Country Strong hadnt been more about the legend of Chiless dental work.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Much of the talk prior to Country Strongs release concerned Gwyneth Paltrows singing and whether shed be convincing playing an established Nashville star. Test passed When drawing from her characters repertoire of fictional country hits Paltrow proves credible. She has stage presence and a pleasing voice capable of finding hidden reserves of power. In fact the many performance scenes in Country Strong--the sophomore effort from The Greatest writer-director Shana Feste--are easily the best moments of the movie both for the pleasant (though overpolished) material and the way Feste captures the heightened reality of performing before a massive crowd when audience expectations and JumboTron screens can blow delicate emotions up to monstrous proportions. The problem is everything else. First seen leaving a treatment facility well before rehab has had time to do its work Paltrow plays a woman as fragile as she is talented. How fragile? As fragile as the possibly symbolic baby bird she nursed back to health after finding it alone in the woods. But husband/manager Tim McGraw seems more concerned about her career than her health having callously booked her on a three-city comeback tour including a stop in Dallas the site of a drunken onstage meltdown that ended with a miscarriage-inducing fall. Along for the ride Garrett Hedlund a singer-songwriter/rehab attendant to whom Paltrows taken a shine for his musical talent as well as his romantic attentions. Also Leighton Meester a beauty-queen-turned-singer whom McGraw thinks might be the next big thing and who appears to have All About Eve-like designs on Paltrows career and marriage. The film has all the makings of a classic overheated showbiz melodrama even without that baby bird but it never commits to the form. In fact it never commits to much of anything. Characters motivations even their personalities shift from scene to scene. Is McGraw a pitiless slave driver pushing his wife to another breakdown or a loving husband trying to keep their marriage together? A succession of black-on-black clothing choices suggests one answer but neither the film nor the character seems to know. (And McGraw does keep expressing concern for that baby birds well-being.) But nobodys performance is as puzzling as Paltrows She throws herself into the songs but not the singer. Though Feste gives her several juicy Ronee Blakley-in-Nashville-style breakdowns Paltrow always appears to be holding back from the edge. She gives the movie as little vulnerability as she can and somehow finds a way to appear vain while playing someone bottoming out. When shes singing she can pass for someone whos been listening to Tammy Wynette since the cradle; when the music stops she looks like a tourist.

It stars Gwyneth Paltrow as Kelly Canter Nashville canary trapped in fames gilded cage.Like some country ballads Shana Festes musical melodrama is as emotionally potent as it is narratively inconsistent. Initially Kelly loves her husband/manager James (Tim McGraw) who has eyes for a young thrush Chiles (Leighton Meester) who has a yen for singer/songwriter Beau (Garrett Hedlund) whos crushing on Kelly. Partners change at regular intervals which makes things unpredictable - and psychologically incoherent.Festes film is designed as a high-performance comeback vehicle customized to Paltrows specs. She is touching in the quiet moments noodling on a guitar while improvising lyrics. After a slow start she commands the hard-drinking heartbreaking passages as if on Patsy Cline overdrive.In art-imitates-life fashion Paltrow plays a star on her way back and Hedlund one on his way up. The films central theme is that love and fame are mutually exclusive. Beau sings for the love not for the money. He joins Kellys overproduced comeback tour as an opening act not because he wants to be in the big leagues but because he wants to take care of her.With his assured performance Hedlund (Tron Legacy) steps into the worn cowboy boots of Heath Ledger working furrowed brow and easy smile to suggest a man in conflict. Like Ledger Hedlund swallows words to near inaudibility and has a gallant restraint that draws others - especially his female costars and his audience - to him.When the film opens Kelly is Britney Spears in boots doing time in rehab after an alcohol-fueled onstage fall that resulted in a miscarriage. At rehab she meets Beau a hunky orderly who moonlights as a honky-tonk singer/songwriter. He is protective of her eggshell fragility in a way that James who says he loves Kelly for her strength cannot fathom. James sure must miss his meal ticket because he pulls wifey out of rehab weeks early so she can start a comeback tour.The glaring weakness of Country Strong is James underwritten and ambiguous more like Kellys pimp than her manager. Is he punishing Kelly by booking Chiles a Taylor Swiftish newcomer in order to make his wife feel anxious about aging? Why does he shrink from Kellys embrace?As Chiles Meester has genuine screen presence. But like McGraw she is saddled with a character who changes more often than an iPod on shuffle. Its hard to get a fix on her.While Paltrow belts out the title anthem with conviction it is the younger performers who sing more intimate and moving numbers that advance the story rather than merely stating it. But as persuasive as Hedlund is not even he can rock a line like ""I dont think love and fame can live in the same place.""Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Tunes emanate from the tall corn - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Tunes emanate from the tall cornCountry Strong a 2 starsJanuary 06 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticGwyneth Paltrow stars as a country singer in ""Country Strong.""""Country Strong"" writer-director Shana Feste has said that country music has ""nothing small or subtle"" in its bones. So right off I question her opinion and suggest that she revisit ""Crazy Heart"" some time or ""Tender Mercies.""Shes true to her word though. The first five minutes of ""Country Strong"" go for nothing small or subtle. (Neither does ""Black Swan"" a far juicier backstage melodrama which may as well carry the title ""Urban Crazy."") Six-time Grammy Award-winning country superstar Kelly Canter played by Gwyneth Paltrow has checked into rehab for alcohol and pill problems after a disastrous flame-out in Dallas that caused her miscarriage. Her hard-driving husband and manager (singer and actor Tim McGraw lately of ""The Blind Side"") walks in on what looks like a rehab-love-nest situation between his wife and rehab staffer Beau played by Garrett Hedlund in full entertaining Kris Kristofferson growl.Beaus an aspiring singer-songwriter himself as well as Kellys Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor and a little something more. The triangle bluntly established ""Country Strong"" proceeds to take Kelly back on the road for a comeback tour with opening acts and romantic complications provided by Beau and by a beauty pageant warbler with stage fright and a few secrets played by Leighton Meester.This is Paltrows first leading role in several years and it offers the Oscar-winning actress a lot heartache discreet trysts with good men and bad drunken misbehavior and heart-of-gold moments where we see the human being beneath all the tabloid noise. To address your questions Yes Paltrow can sing. And yes shes more than able to pull off a portrayal of an unstable Nashville icon at war with her demons.But my God is this script predictable. Each relapse and betrayal shows up announced and then announced again a little louder by the dialogue equivalent of an aggravating doorman. When for example Kelly arrives at the recording studio only to find that the interloping up-and-comer played by Meester has stolen her song the scene carries almost no impact. I realize what Feste is suggesting about the notion of subtlety in this universe. But plenty of terrific songwriters have found ways to invest real subtlety real human feeling -- the telling off-handed detail tucked inside the heart-on-sleeve sentiment -- in their work to see familiar country-and-western mythologies reduced to corn syrup this way. The movies well-acted. Almost everything else about ""Country Strong"" is weak. ""You belong on stage singing in front of thousands of people"" McGraw tells Paltrow early on. We hear it but despite Paltrows sincere and often touching efforts we never fully buy what happens offstage before and after the singing.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic elements involving alcohol abuse and some sexual content)Cast Gwyneth Paltrow (Kelly Canter); Tim McGraw (James Canter); Garrett Hedlund (Beau Hutton); Leighton Meester (Chiles Stanton)Credits Written and directed by Shana Feste; produced by Tobey Maguire and Jenno Topping.

Kelly Canter (Paltrow) a country superstar lounges on her stomach in a rehab center her legs swung provocatively behind her as she flirts with a handsome orderly (and aspiring singer) named Beau (Garrett Hedlund). Paltrows casual drawl sounds right; her face lovely but unmade-up looks just worn enough to spell out ""Sexy Survivor of Hard Times""; and when she tries out a fragment of a number Beau has written its in a crystal-clear high voice -- a songbird twang. So far so good. Then Kellys manager/husband James (Tim McGraw) enters the room and sensing a rival drags her out of rehab a month early to jump-start her career. There is of course a scandal The year before Kelly fell off an arena stage in Dallas while drunk -- and lost the baby she was carrying. Youd think that might call for an orchestrated lack of drama in her life but thats not what happens in Country Strong. James pushes Kelly into a three-city trial tour and Beau at Kellys insistence comes along as her ""protector"" and opening act. As if to balance the flirtation equation James also books Chiles (Leighton Meester) a beauty queen-turned-singer who idolizes Kelly but would love to step into her shoes. Its no wonder that when Kelly finally goes on stage she falls apart and cant perform -- a scene that echoes Ronee Blakleys onstage breakdown in Nashville. But Country Strong alas treats Kellys messed-up concert not as the warning sign of disaster it clearly is but as just one more garish moment of overheated country-movie melodrama. Written and directed by Shana Feste the film keeps throwing things at you drunk scenes adultery scenes All About Eve rise-of-the-young-rival scenes. Yet despite the presence of some appealing actors none of it quite adds up. The movie stitches together bits and pieces of other better films from Sweet Dreams to Crazy Heart with a minimum of emotional coherence. Scene for scene its not abysmally staged but its a cliche-ridden heart-on-the-sleeve mess. Garrett Hedlund from TRON Legacy proves his range here. Hes hunky in a low-down Brad Pitt way with chops to boot (quick someone cast him as Jeff Buckley). His characters actions though make little sense -- is Beau out to save Kelly? Woo her? Or woo Chiles? -- and unfortunately thats true for Kelly as well. As she grabs another bottle of Smirnoff we can see that shes ""wrestling with demons"" but where did those demons come from? The closest thing we get to an explanation is a back-of-the- limo speech about her not being allowed to pierce her ears as a girl. The films songs are catchy Tim McGraw (The Blind Side) has a teddy-bear-cute coolness and the climactic concert is a doozy -- it shows that Gwyneth knows the spangly high-powered joys of country music. Too bad that in Country Strong shes too busy acting out the hysterical and mostly nonsensical sorrows.

Country Strong Bad Director Shana Feste. Cast Gwyneth Paltrow Garrett Hedlund Leighton Meester. Rating PG-13 for thematic elements involving alcohol abuse and for sexual content. Guide to this weeks new releases Gwyneth Paltrow | Movies about musicians Qamp;A Garrett Hedlund having a big year As in Who stole the plot? Alas that question goes unanswered in the movie written and directed by Shana Feste. Several good performances are left adrift as the characters roam from scene to scene singing (quite well) as they go. Even as a sort of long-form music video its disjointed. >> Guide to this weeks new releases Gwyneth Paltrow stars as Kelly Canter a huge country star who is in rehab when we meet her sobering up after falling during a concert while drunk and losing the baby she was pregnant with. Shes tended to by Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund) who works at the rehab center but is at heart a country singer. He writes songs with her until the day her husband James (Tim McGraw) decides shes better its time to go on tour. Kelly is unsure and Beau is adamantly against it - shes clearly not healthy enough. But money talks the fans demand it and off they go - with Beau as the opening act. This is especially complicated because he and Kelly obviously have feelings for each other which James seems aware of but for whatever reason chooses to ignore. Hes busy worrying about Dallas the big show theyre working toward - and where Kelly lost her baby. Theyre also joined by Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester) a beauty-queen type with stage fright who like seemingly everyone else in the film writes songs at the drop of a (10-gallon) hat. She seems to have some past with Beau but its never really explained. They spar but its obvious where things are leading. At one point a back-up musician yells ""Why dont you just sleep with her already?"" When a minor character has to suggest obvious plot points youve got problems. Speaking of problems Kellys got them too though theyre presented in broad strokes. When you hear a line like ""The only problem with the pills is if she mixes them with alcohol"" in a movie like this you dont expect to be surprised. James and Kelly toting around a bird shes found in a box isnt exactly subtle either. Too bad because the songs are good as is the singing. Paltrow makes a believable country star when sober enough to perform even more so when too drunk to. McGraw is fine but his character suffers the most from missing-development syndrome. Meesters character is built on even more cliches than the rest but she can belt out the songs. Hedlund is the best of the lot; happily the story is told more from his perspective than anyone elses. Still despite some good acting with a story this weak youre better off sticking with the soundtrack. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

There her decolletage decked out in black lace and a bling cross she jams in more than one sense with singer-songwriter-janitor Beau (Tron fox Garrett Hedlund) until her husband James (actual country star Tim McGraw who inexplicably doesnt sing until the closing credits) drags her on a three-date comeback tour. A sexless Svengali (his reaction to Kellys revelation that shes just had ""one of them Brazilian bikini waxes"" is the films best punch line) James has already found an opening act in Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester) the Katy Perry of would-be country stars whose fierce determination is equal parts honey and acid. When Chiles chokes onstage and Beau saves her James invites his wifes boyfriend to ""get out of these honky-tonks and step into the big leagues"" by joining the tour. Soon the aging divas bad behavior becomes a bit too much for both hubby and young lover creating an opening onstage and in bed for the ingenue. Country Strong is sillier -- and more tone-deaf -- than Paltrows advice website GOOP. The intersection of Chiles and Beaus rise with Kellys epic downward spiral (embodied in the image of her crying on a massive JumboTron as floor-to-ceiling American flags are unfurled on either side) is pure A Star Is Born stuff. Except theres no knowingness here making Country Strong a rare specimen in our postironic age legitimately unintentional camp.

TWITTER Flick feels like a script that needed a Page One rewrite. The best country songs never take themselves too seriously. Hell if you really believed every emotion in certain ones youd want to kill yourself. But there is usually something good-natured in even a low-down tale of woe. Writer-director Shana Festes Country Strong a melodrama set among country music performers takes itself far too seriously. Themes and cliches plucked from countless country lyrics fuel a thoroughly unconvincing show business story about a larger-than-life crash-and-burn star and her unruly entourage of self-serving personalities. The odd-couple pairing of Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow and country superstar Tim McGraw -- who never sings a lick in the entire movie -- might pull in fans during the opening frames. But this Country doesnt seem strong enough to last more than a few weeks in theaters. Its only real pluses are fine vocal performances from Paltrow -- shes sung in movies such as Duets and Infamous so this is no surprise -- and by the relative newcomers Garrett Hedlund (Tron Legacy) and Leighton Meester (Gossip Girl). Paltrow also looks sensational along with displaying great pipes. Meanwhile McGraw is asked to go against his own likable personality to play a character who is anal-retentive self-pitying and continually out of sorts. Who thought that was a good idea? But then there are few good ideas here since the movie wallows in about every country chestnut imaginable. If its country theres got to be a drunken performer struggling to get back in the game right? If its country its got to have betrayals broken hearts a sick kid a couple of punches to the face and pickup trucks. Yep got em all. Paltrow plays a country superstar in rehab whose manager-husband (McGraw) pulls her out of the facility far too early to begin a comeback. Somehow while in rehab she contrives -- or rather Feste does it for her -- to have an affair with an up-and-coming singer (Hedlund) who just happens to work in the facility. Next thing you know her husband has signed him up as her opening act along with his new protege a beauty queen-turned-singer (Meester). A romantic triangle swiftly turns into a quadrangle. Oh and lets not forget a baby bird the superstar has rescued from an abandoned nest which she carries around as a poor symbolic substitute for the fetus she lost when a drunken fall onstage caused a miscarriage. Its hard to synopsize this movie because it sounds even worse than it actually is. What relieves the utter crassness of the story are quite a few songs performed well by the two youngsters. You wish that Paltrows character wasnt forever collapsing onstage so she can sing her heart out too. Near the climax she finally gets to strut her stuff musically. But why does the movie hold this back? The dynamics between Hedlund and Meester are equally puzzling. He initially is contemptuous of her and her talent yet this doesnt prevent him from coming to her rescue when she freezes onstage or staring at her with bedroom eyes despite his supposed romantic loyalty to his married lover. This is not his only contradictory behavior. On this ill-fated tour he becomes an overnight sensation but inexplicably wants to shun stardom to play in clubs and honky-tonks. Country Strong feels like a script that needed a Page One rewrite. Ideas and character relationships are poorly thought out. Motivations are hard to pin down as characters seemingly abandon their own best interests. Feste who has one previous effort as a writer-director last years The Greatest fails here to do the most basic thing -- give an audience a rooting interest or any interest at all in these four troubled people. Showbiz glamour and soap opera only get you so far.

"Movie review Country Strong - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Movie review Country Strong Gwyneth Paltrow Scott Garfield / Screen Gems Gwyneth Paltrow stars in ""Country Strong."" Gwyneth Paltrow stars in ""Country Strong."" (Scott Garfield / Screen Gems) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times film critic There is a down-home comfort saturating ""Country Strong"" in that ""somebody done somebody wrong song"" way that almost carries you through when its music-drenched melodrama gets predictable. Which is pretty much as soon as the fragile still-in-rehab country superstar played by Gwyneth Paltrow starts talking about the baby bird shes found and is trying to save. So like Scene 2.Paltrows Kelly Canter is trying to mend her own broken wing her drinking and on-stage meltdowns having put her career in need of rehab and recovery too. The actress brings her own surprisingly sweet voice to the foot-stomping two-stepping proceedings with such surety that if you didnt catch her coming-out party on the Country Music Assn. Awards last month (or on ""Glee"" or missed ""Duets"" in 2000 with Paltrow singing and her late dad Bruce directing) youll probably find yourself saying ""Wow that girl can sing."" Which as it happens is not necessarily the take-away you want from a movie even one about the roughhouse country music industry though it always becomes a topic when actors take on these roles. Its a very tough arena that writer/director Shana Feste has chosen to play in given such classic movies and classic performances as Sissy Spacek in ""Coal Miners Daughter"" Robert Duvall in ""Tender Mercies"" Jessica Lange in ""Sweet Dreams"" Reese Witherspoon in ""Walk the Line"" and Jeff Bridges in last years ""Crazy Heart."" The roles won Oscars for all but Lange who did get a nomination.When the starting point is a world in which even the toughest guys wear their hearts on their sleeves the trick for filmmakers is how to walk the line without getting stuck in the muck and that is a problem the filmmaker hasnt yet figured out. ""Country Strong"" is Festes second film and she infuses it with an earnestness that swings between too too much and appealing the same earnestness that swamped her filmmaker debut last year with ""The Greatest."" But this time in the more nuanced moments (and there are some of those) she has a way with dialogue that could turn her into a force if she can ever get the balance right and send the obvious packing. The story is an all-too-familiar one that deadly cocktail of too much fame and too much drink for someone whos lost touch with who she really is anymore. The film opens with Kelly about to trade rehab for the road again. Her husband-manager James played by real-life country music superstar Tim McGraw and about the only one in the movie who doesnt sing is sure shes ready. Besides James has a double shot in mind jump-starting Kellys stalled career while launching another a sassy bit of hot sauce just off the beauty pageant circuit named Chiles Stanton (""Gossip Girls"" Leighton Meester).Meanwhile Kellys sober buddy at the facility an attentive singer-songwriting hunk named Beau ( Garrett Hedlund) with bedroom eyes and talent -- a lethal cocktail in its own right -- is not so sure. With that the filmmaker has stacked the deck with four combustible egos primed to be manipulated by ambition need love betrayal and backsliding -- so you know going in theres no way anyone is going to walk away unscathed from the emotional wreckage that is sure to come.Director of photography John Bailey opens things up pouring a lot of light into all the dark places Feste has created. Though the film unfolds in and around Dallas shooting it on location in Nashville has served to give the look a rock-solid foundation that Bailey takes full advantage of. The music (in the hands of Michael Brook and music supervisor Randall Poster) that runs through the production is a blend of old standards from the Merle Haggard and Hank Williams set and the new country of Hayes Carll (check out his ""Bad Liver and a Broken Heart"" sometime). Whether in dive bars with bare stages or big-hair blow-outs staging the performances is where the filmmaker finds her comfort zone.What helps elevate ""Country Strong"" when the music stops is the strength of the performances. Paltrow is an actress who slips into roles as if they were old sweats creating a kind of organic fit whether its the light loveliness of her theater romantic in ""Shakespeare in Love"" or her darkly used down-market girl in ""Two Lovers."" As Kelly she brings a rural authenticity and human touch that are never better than when she plays to a Make-a-Wish kid named Travis. Its not easy to play opposite that but McGraw does a credible job. He is such an appealing guy on-screen working an easy charm in a way that seems so effortless its turning him into Hollywoods good old boy of choice (see ""The Blind Side""). But the scene stealer is the Minnesota farmboy Hedlund who took up the guitar for the film and despite an acting hot streak that includes ""Tron Legacy"" actually could quit his day job. His scruffy Trace Adkins-style baritone and kickback charisma on-stage makes Beau irresistible to more than just Kelly. For the most part Hedlund comes off as a natural never in a hurry relying on instinct to know when and how to play the hand hes been dealt. Feste has the right instincts too she just doesnt have the ease yet. The voice in ""Country Strong"" though unsteady still is distinctive enough especially on the emotional notes that you hope she figures out how to get it right.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Music Country Strong (movie) Movie Industry Celebrities Health Gwyneth Paltrow walks a fine line with Country Strong Pop amp; Hiss goes to the movies A look at the years Oscar-contending movie songs Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-country-strong-20101222,0,5093561.story",200,countrystrong32,countrystrong,latimes

A tabloid-torn backstage soap opera is rendered with considerable empathy and emotional complexity in ""Country Strong."" Though conceived as a singing-acting showcase for Gwyneth Paltrow tracing the downward spiral of a Nashville superstar whos lately produced fewer hits than headlines this second feature from ""The Greatest"" writer-director Shana Feste is that rare ensemble piece in which all four principals are not only compellingly drawn but handled with an astute sense of dramatic balance. Buoyed by an expectedly fine soundtrack and obvious heartland appeal Sony release (opening today before going wide Jan. 7) should strike chords beyond its built-in Camp;W fanbase. Like an unabashedly corny tune delivered with enough warmth and sincerity to still hit the sweet spot ""Country Strong"" looks derivative on paper but plays out with a startling depth of feeling -- no small feat considering it feels pieced together from snippets of every behind-the-scenes meller ever spun. At times resembling a Texas-touring ""All About Eve"" the film also recalls last years ""Crazy Heart"" with its aching lament for a musician brought low by booze and bad luck. Feste has said the story was inspired by Britney Spears media woes; intended or not parallels to the troubled personal life of country star Mindy McCrea are also there for the taking. Singer-songwriter Kelly Canter (Paltrow) is sprung from rehab by her husband-manager James (Tim McGraw) whos determined to salvage her career with a tour of Austin Houston and finally Dallas -- the city where during a fateful concert several months earlier a drunken Kelly took a tumble and suffered a miscarriage. Kelly and James marriage still hasnt recovered from the blow spurring the moody songstress to seek comfort in the arms of up-and-coming crooner Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund) even as she voices her jealous distrust of Chiles (rhymes with ""wiles"") Stanton (Leighton Meester) a former beauty queen and aspiring singer whos caught James eye. In establishing these four personalities and arranging them in a configuration that will yield maximum dramatic sparks the script doesnt shy away from coincidence (Beau met Kelly while working at her rehab facility) or predictability. Inevitably Beau and Chiles join Kellys tour as opening acts at which point their initially competitive dynamic flowers into romance sending Kelly into further depths of despair and jeopardizing her attempted comeback. But the films saving grace is that its personalities always ring true even when its situations dont. Feste sees her characters whole and she has an unusual knack for finding her way into a scene and locating its emotional truth often indirectly Beau and Kellys first moment onscreen -- in which they playfully improvise a song during an impromptu jam session -- shows how the easy chemistry between two actors can turn a scripted moment into one of great tenderness and privileged intimacy. Every significant relationship in the film has its own uniquely tense dynamic Kelly and James struggle to revive a marriage weighed down by professional obligations; James and Beaus intense mutual antipathy; Kellys icy treatment of Chiles who returns the cold shoulder with wide-eyed admiration; and Beau and Chiles very different reactions to their tantalizing first brushes with fame. Notably while Kellys battle with the bottle is effectively dramatized (if marred by an excess of eyeliner in Paltrows numerous crying scenes) the counterbalance provided by the other characters keeps the story from becoming a straightforward saga of addiction and recovery. And although Kellys fragile state is well served by Paltrows natural vulnerability the actress is at her best in those brave fleeting moments when this down-and-out diva manages to summon a strength and resilience she didnt realize she still had in her. Making use of a Southern drawl almost as thick as his mustache Hedlund registers much more boldly here than in the current ""Tron Legacy"" playing a guy whose impulsive need to rescue the women closest to him doesnt always result in the wisest decisions. Even more impressive is Meester (""Gossip Girl"") who not only looks and sounds like a country star but movingly exposes the talented yet insecure young woman beneath Chiles shallow-princess veneer. Both Hedlund and Meester get to show off their singing chops particularly in the duet ""Give in to Me"" -- one of several original tunes selected by Feste and music supervisor Randall Poster with a keen ear for the way a song can amplify a films emotional undercurrents. The fact that Kelly herself has trouble performing allows Paltrow to keep her lovely voice under wraps early on though she rightly conquers her climactic moments in the spotlight. McGraw ironically the one actor not called upon to perform serves in a sense as the films good-faith talisman authenticating its chosen milieu. Set primarily in Texas but shot entirely in Nashville the film boasts solid but not lavish production values; crucially its concert sequences nail the flag-waving Jesus-loving heartbeat of country music without a trace of condescension.

ABOUT THE MOVIECountry Strong  1/2 (out of four)Stars Gwyneth Paltrow Tim McGraw Garrett Hedlund Leighton MeesterDirector Shana FesteDistributor Screen GemsRating PG-13 for thematic elements involving alcohol abuse and some sexual contentRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesOpens Wednesday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Country Strong feels powerfully familiar. Wasnt it just last year when we saw a music-centered drama with a country singer battling alcoholism and a host of personal demons? While the story of country music star Kelly Canter (Gwyneth Paltrow) isnt identical to Crazy Heart there are enough similarities to it -- and other crash-and-burn musical odysseys like A Star Is Born and The Rose-- to make it seem derivative. Paltrows character has a similarly self-destructive streak as Jeff Bridges but shes not down-and-out. Unlike the grizzled Bad Blake who plays seedy dives glamorous Kelly is famous drawing huge audiences in major arenas. Shes also married to James her manager played by real-life country star Tim McGraw. On the surface she would appear a better candidate than Blake to surmount her troubles turn her life around and attain superstar status. INTERVIEW Paltrow stays strong on all fronts TRAILER See a snippet of Country Strong When the movie opens Kelly is released from rehab where she landed in the middle of a tour after drinking too much falling and losing the baby she was carrying. Her husband pressures her to resume the lucrative tour and there is a palpable strain between them. They dont discuss the lost pregnancy but there is a tenderness between them as they fuss over a baby bird. Kelly is childlike in her ministrations to the bird which is a rather cliched way to illustrate her innocent fragility. Kelly talented as she may be is a needy soul. In her yearning for connection she has embarked on a romantic relationship with Beau Hutton a young musician/singer (TRON Legacys Garrett Hedlund). And even though shes cheating on James with Beau she resents her husbands fascination with Chiles Stanton a talented perky up-and-coming singer (Leighton Meester). Paltrow is a good singer and performer effectively conveying her characters emotional vulnerability. But the story seems either badly edited or under-written. What is Kellys back story? Has she struggled with addiction for a long time? Why does the couple avoid discussing the elephant in the room? McGraws aloof character is even less developed. Consequently its tough to feel much for either of them. Its Hedlund who makes the strongest impression. Hes got a laid-back whiskery charm convincing as a singer with integrity and heart. Meester also shows she can do more than play one of Gossip Girls privileged Manhattan socialite. As written and directed by Shana Feste -- whose last film was the moving The Greatest starring Pierce Brosnan Susan Sarandon and Carey Mulligan--Country Strong needed a few more script revisions and additional fleshing out before the cameras rolled. Most of the effort seems to have gone into the original music which is pleasant but not memorable and too little on creating believable multidimensional characters.
