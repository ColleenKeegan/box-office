Photo Credit Lionsgate Films advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In Harlem in 1987 an illiterate sexually abused girl tries to salvage her life. Rating R (abusive sexuality violence profanity) BOTTOM LINE A must-see especially for Sidibe and MoNique; youll be hearing about them come Oscar time. CAST Gabourey Sidibe MoNique Paula Patton Mariah Carey WHEN/WHERE Playing at Lincoln Square 13 Empire 25 Union Square Stadium 14 and Magic Johnson Harlem 9 Manhattan. Opening Nov. 13 on Long Island. LENGTH 149 The body of Gabourey Sidibe a 26-year-old Harlem actress making her film debut as the star of ""Precious"" is not the kind often seen among leading actresses. Sidibe who plays the 350-pound Claireece ""Precious"" Jones is herself obese. She is also African-American with darker skin than Hollywood typically prefers on its women. But the thing to watch in this frank and brutal film about a nearly illiterate teenager who is pregnant by her own father (again) is Sidibes face. During moments of pain and there are many Precious eyes withdraw behind protective cheeks. Lectured by well-meaning white people she adopts a hauteur that would have impressed Bette Davis. Confronted with kindness she suddenly looks as trusting as an infant. advertisement | advertise on newsday The remarkable Sidibe is one of several daring casting choices by director Lee Daniels. The others include comedian MoNique as Precious monstrously abusive mother Mary; the elegant Paula Patton as an inner-city schoolteacher; and Mariah Carey as a seen-it-all social worker. (Lenny Kravitz appears briefly as a male nurse.) Sharp acting across the board helps ""Precious"" rise above its message-movie limitations as does Daniels refusal to pretty up his story. (The script by Geoffrey Fletcher is based on Sapphires 1996 novel.) When Precious gobbles an entire bucket of fried chicken leaving her face shiny with grease you might find yourself wanting to look away. Of course thats been societys reaction to Precious all her life. Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry are credited as executive producers here but that doesnt mean this is a feel-good redemption story. In Precious world survival must count as triumph enough.

Director Lee Daniels and writer Geoffrey Fletchers adaptation of Sapphires novel Push oozes empathy from the first scene to the last. Its inescapably bleak but occasionally it has the confidence and spirit to emerge from the shadows of its tragic story - the tale of Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) an obese 16-year-old teenager in 1980s Harlem who is abused by her mother and father - to indulge in sly humour and jolly camaraderie before retreating again into the darkness at its heart.My names Clarissa Precious Jones... and I want to be on the cover of a magazine says Sidibe. What she gets is less glitzy we learn of the gross difference between the refuge of her mind and the reality of her life. When her vile mother (MoNique grotesque chilling but in the end almost sympathetic) screams I should have aborted your motherfuckin ass Precious imagines herself walking the red carpet at a film premiere. Perhaps most movingly when she looks in the mirror she sees a girl who is more beautiful and more white.So a better life is possible but imagination just isnt enough Precious is a film about real escape not dreams. The film celebrates a winning combination of individual strength education and community over the warped logic of the sort of corrupt household where a loveless grandma puts on a wig and feigns love for a Downs syndrome child a piece of theatre to secure a cheque from a visiting social worker. Its a film that acknowledges poverty and inequality while refusing to believe that people cant escape from their grip. Its a truly American movie. Its realism is social - not socialist - and its happy flights of imagination recall the magical side of Danny Boyle more than the grit of Ken Loach.Slowly surely Precious attends a special school with an inspirational teacher (Paula Patton) begins sessions with a social worker (Mariah Carey unobtrusive) and fights her silent violent and self-loathing tendencies to make new friends a colourful bunch of girls in her class from a mouthy Jamaican immigrant to a tough nut from The Bronx. Its not an easy battle and Daniels has a tendency to land new blows when you think the fight is over. So oppressive and extreme is Preciouss background that you imagine terrible things are about to happen even when theyre not. I didnt find the film as actively upsetting as many have reported - merely very very sad.The film arrives here after winning prizes at Toronto and Sundance and gaining four Bafta nominations. So should you believe the hype? Yes and no. Precious is very affecting and has some great performances especially from Sidibe and MoNique but the film is arguably more heart than art. Is that such a bad thing? Perhaps not when a film shines a light on a desperate way of life and gives dignity to characters barely ever portrayed on screen you can forgive some clumsy emphatic storytelling and a narrative thats too episodic and reliant on voiceover. Its a film full of life and love well-meaning and judging by the reaction in the US a genuine and important phenomenon that says act - dont dwell - on your dreams. A genuine Obama-era movie then.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + In ""Precious Claireece Precious Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) usually comes home from school and prepares dinner for her mother Mary (MoNique) in their Harlem apartment. Mary could probably make dinner herself. But its easier for her to throw the dinner out or at Claireece if shes not the cook. Mary curses at Claireece who is dark-skinned overweight and at 16 having an impossible time making it of out of middle school. Claireece who prefers to be called Precious stands there and absorbs Marys tirades as if it were her daughterly duty. She did the same when her father raped her twice leaving her pregnant and Mary violent with jealousy. The relationship doesnt change. But the younger woman realizes it needs to.This movie catalogs a wealth of human ugliness. Its even been made to look ugly presumably to underscore the horror movie that is Preciouss life. (Mary castigates her daughter from a stairwell just like Piper Laurie did to Sissy Spacek in ""Carrie.) But ""Precious in its own way is a work of astonishing joy. Avoiding the conventional tricks of lifting an audience up the movie looks into this girls wide brown face and her bleak little life and sees despite everything a reason to live.Director Lee Daniels brings to the screen a vitality that cuts against the awfulness we hear about and see without daring to dull a thing. Living the director seems to say means being alive to savor the good and to feel the bruise of the bad. So his camera usually gets right up close to the sex and the assaults but it also transports us deep inside Preciouss psyche where her shame commingles with her fantasies. A blond white girl stares back at her in the mirror. In her red-carpet daydreams she sounds like Nicole Kidman and in the photo shoots of her mind shes Naomi Campbell. In these daydreams her companion is a cute creamy-looking Nuyorican boy. And yet Preciouss fairy godmother arrives in the opening scene and its Susan Taylor the former editor of Essence who made it her mission to remind black girls that theyre beautiful.Absurdly the films full title is ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire. The movie is set in 1987 and I dont think there was a theater back then whose marquee could hold all that title. Sapphires 1996 book was a work of point-blank dread. Screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher has streamlined the graphic degradation without making the usual compromises. Like the book the movie still leaves you feeling like Mike Tyson just knocked you out. And you can practically smell Newports and fried food wafting from under the theater seats.Sapphire wrote brutally in Preciouss subgrammatical cadences - Zora Neale Hurston without the lyricism. The movie is similarly blunt. But like the novel its not unpoetic either as it enters the mind and feelings of a young black girl. Thats a feat so rare some moviegoers might want to bring a passport. Through narration Precious still comments on her situation. In her sleepy congested mumble she explains for instance that shes attracted to her math teacher (Bill Sage) who in her imagination gives a lascivious wink back. But nightmares of her fathers transgressions persist courtesy of montages that juxtapose rape and buttery food sizzling in a pan. This is high sensationalism but its not as if Daniels is going for anything else. This girls life is a sensationalists dream. But part of what permits all the obscenity to move you is that the filmmaking doesnt exploit or condescend. This is not Rob Reiner stepping out of his limo to toss a picture frame around a tragedy or the pro-integration preaching of ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner. Clearly Daniels is drawn to salaciousness and melodrama. But he gives the movie an authentic rawness that cuts right past realism into reality and even luridly beyond that. Food is presented so unpleasantly so often that youll think twice about your next KFC variety bucket.Europeans notably Belgiums Dardenne brothers have told versions of this story more soberly and observationally. Realism though isnt quite right for the grotesquerie and comedy here. At one point Daniels tries old Italian war drama sticking Precious and her mother in a black-and-white scene from Vittorio De Sicas ""Two Women where Marys abuses continue. The movie wants to go a little bit nuts which is what happens whenever the comedian-actress MoNique is on screen. Her stage act specialized in raunchy self-empowerment. Her movie work specifically her tour de force in 2006s ""Phat Girlz has been about self-destructiveness. Her ""Precious performance feels as much about spiritual exorcism as acting. It all culminates in a grand emotional breakdown that not even roadside assistance could do anything about.While the sturm und drang of life with Mary will grab headlines the heart of the movie is about personal breakthrough. The best scenes happen between Precious and her classmates in an alternative-education program. Shes not the only one with a miserable story (although hers pretty much takes the cake) and the bond these girls share is powerful. The women Daniels cast are exuberant especially Xosha Roquemore who plays a showboat named JoAnn. They have great accents and fierce attitudes and you sense that they believe theyre all in this together. Danielss hot-flash style cools into what could pass for social documentary.In those and other scenes the movies central struggle is between Preciouss self-doubt and the adults who refuse to give up on her. Oddly they are all played by light-skinned actors Paula Patton as the programs tireless teacher Ms. Rain; Lenny Kravitz as a bohemian nurse; and a very good very human-looking Mariah Carey who bites down hard on her role as a social worker. Its the old problem of complexion but Daniels seems loosely aware of it. When Mary arrives to make her unfathomable apology to Precious her face is coated with white powder. Who is she trying to fool?From the center of all this tempestuousness Gabourey Sidibe wrests control of the movie. Sidibe who is 26 and hadnt acted before landed the part after an open casting call. And the surprise of her performance is how alive it is given the deadening nature of what her character endures. A vivid personality emerges and what seemed like strategic restraint on Sidibes part turns out to be indomitable strength.In another movie - one we dont need to see again - Precious would be playing for that life-saving football scholarship. A talent scout would hear her sing. Or Richard Gere would come along and hire her to be his girlfriend. The exhilarating last images in ""Precious are of a woman far from the helping hands of Hollywood. Shes determined to save herself.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 7 2009 Save for later Saved Actress-comedienne MoNique is shown in a scene from ""Precious."" Anne Marie Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Precious Based on the Novel Push By Sapphire"" is an ungainly title for a powerfully ungainly movie. Boxers like to say that a punch hurts less if you see it coming. I saw just about every punch coming my way in ""Precious"" and yet it still packs a hurtful wallop. It melodramatizes everything and yet its overall effect is something more than melodrama.Gabourey Sidibe plays Claireece ""Precious"" Jones a 350-pound near-illiterate 16-year-old who is pregnant for a second time by her father who turns out to be HIV positive and lives with her nightmarishly abusive single mother Mary (MoNique) in a dingy two-floor apartment in Harlem.This litany of woe is laid on awfully thick. Director Lee Daniels and his screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher periodically showcase Preciouss fantasies of dancing with a studly beau at the Apollo or gazing into the mirror and seeing the reflection of a slim blonde white girl. You can cut the pathos with an Exacto knife. Much more egregious is how Daniels intercuts Precious being raped by her father with shots of eggs being fried in bubbly grease. Here is a filmmaker who does not trust his material to speak for itself. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? What rescues ""Precious"" is that Daniels also has a sharp documentarians eye for realism. As overblown and coercive as his movie often is it also has admirable feel for the workaday struggles of its people especially Preciouss. Its a bizarrely bifurcated movie alternately realistic and garishly hyperbolic. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Precious Based on the Novel ""Push"" By Sapphire Both Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey came on board as executive producers after the film won awards and standing ovations at Sundance (a response duplicated in Cannes and Toronto). Its easy to see what appealed to them The heartbreak in this movie is never so abject that it cannot be overcome.But this inspirationalism is what I liked least about ""Precious.""Making Precious an Everygirl whose struggle becomes an advertisement for uplift feels false to the mood and tragedy of the piece. The horrors in this movie are not so easily dispelled. (It opens with the onscreen words ""Everything is a gift of the universe."" Some gift some universe.)Sidibe is an untrained actress but in some ways this works to the films advantage. Her flat line readings and inexpressive features carry the conviction of someone who has closed herself off from empathy. Thrown out of school for being pregnant Precious is nevertheless intelligent enough to realize she wont survive without an education so she enrolls much against her mothers boozy protestations in an alternative school. Her rowdy classmates become friends perhaps her first and a teacher with the improbable name Blu Rain (Paula Patton) becomes a kind of surrogate mother. (At least she wasnt named Blu Ray but then again the film is set in 1987.)Ms. Rain is in a long line of movie ""teachers-who-just-wont-give-up"" and her angelic gumption is the movies most conventional trope. Compare her with MoNiques Mary who is like no one else Ive seen in the movies. This monster is fiercely intensely human which only serves to heighten the monstrousness. Known as a bawdy comic MoNique once again proves the truism that comic actors have the ready-made chops for drama. (Think of Bette Midler in ""The Rose."")Mary is unfathomable and when she delivers her big self-justifying monologue at the end to Preciouss social worker (an almost unrecognizably dour Mariah Carey) she only seems more so. MoNique doesnt go in for a lot of special pleading. She plays it hard right to the finish so much so that the upbeat addendum that closes out the film seems unintentionally like a good-time fantasia.Precious moves from a girl who refers to herself as ""ugly black grease to be washed from the street"" to a young woman who becomes the mother she never had. In the rush of overheated praise for this movies power would I be a spoilsport to ask what the sequel might look like? From the looks of it Precious is en route to ""Oprah."" Grade B+ (Rated R for child abuse including sexual assault and pervasive language.)

It isnt that those descriptions arent appropriate. They are. Lee Daniels astounding second feature is after all the pained saga of a child shaped by abuse -- sexual emotional and yes socioeconomic. Claireece ""Precious"" Jones is a 16-year-old from Harlem who is pregnant (again) illiterate and abused sexually and emotionally by her father (gone) and her mother (present and volatile). But the words merely capture the pathology depicted in the film. They dont get at its more profound and shattering joy. A dance with darkness isnt the reason ""Precious"" is so stirring and striking a piece of work although the comic MoNiques depiction of Precious mother is unforgettable. So here are a few of the images that give this bold work its amazing grace and provide evidence of Daniels deep appreciation of the details that save us an orange scarf; blue eye shadow; a television clip of Shirley Chisholm announcing her 1972 presidential run. These are nothing short of signs of life along the way to a woman-childs transformation from lost to found. And then there is the word that marks the shattering turning point for the Harlem teen who has so much stacked against her that some cynics have likened her to a stereotype missing only the hounds nipping at her heels. That word is ""Here."" In a gale-force debut Gabourey Sidibe sits squeezed into a chair in a classroom at an alternative school. She has been suspended from her public high school. Dangerously overweight she is a mass. She is impossible to ignore yet invisible to those around her. She is unloved. Yet she harbors some flickering inkling that she deserves better. Ms. Rain (the luminous Paula Patton) asks her students to say something about themselves. Precious demurs then changes her mind. Its the first time shes spoken in a classroom. How does that make her feel? Ms. Rain asks. ""Here."" Her voice sounds like it comes from some recess. ""Precious"" would not be so soul-rattling if the filmmaking were timid. Daniels is fearless. He seems to have required the same from his actors. MoNique plunges headfirst into a moral abyss that makes her frightening. Not since Sybils mom has there been such an indecent parent. Mary has declared open warfare on her daughter. Pans fly. Words devastate. She intends to vanquish. After all Precious was impregnated by her ""man."" ""Precious"" isnt a tale about rescuers though there is a village of characters reaching out. A former principal stands outside Precious apartment building sucking on a cigarette and carrying on a pivotal conversation on an intercom. A nurse (Lenny Kravitz) tries to school Precious and her ""Each One Teach One"" classmates in nutrition. One critic described ""Precious"" which won both the grand jury prize and the audience award at Sundance in January as ""poverty porn."" Its not. But it is graphic. And it argues a point we all should know There is something obscene in a wealthy nations children living in neglect. Mariah Carey unadorned and barely recognizable is subtle as Mrs. Weiss a welfare caseworker. She is our stand-in in the films most powerful moment. If Marys profanity-laden tirade early in the film ushered us into Precious hell the teary monologue that Mary delivers sitting in Ms. Weiss cubicle with Precious nearby is its differently evil twin. It is a stunning ""empathy with the devil"" scene. ""Precious"" isnt a sociological diatribe. And its story of abuse isnt peculiar to poor folk. Daniels isnt a practitioner of indie filmdoms ""new neo-realism."" He provides pockets of hope. Imagination protects however briefly. A sexual assault gives way to a paparazzi fantasy. Precious bejeweled signs autographs before a thunderstorm and reality set in. The film is not without moments of humor. Even his use of music eschews the predictable. Its another way he creates an alternative rhythm to the beat-downs Precious receives at home. Sunny Gales chirpy swing of a hit ""Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?"" would seem too obvious a selection for our heros journey. Instead its a gift to her and us. Daniels vision here is closer to that of the novelist Toni Morrison. His real is magical. It goes beyond. It liberates a girl named Precious. When Ms. Rain first invites Precious to join her in the classroom the youngster walks slowly tentatively down the hallway. Daniels makes it look like shes going toward the light. Toward another life. She is. ""PRECIOUS BASED ON THE NOVEL PUSH BY SAPPHIRE."" R for substance abuse strong language and a sex scene. 1 hour 49 minutes.

"Precious Based on the Novel ""Push"" by Sapphire - Real and raw | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPrecious Based on the Novel ""Push"" by Sapphire - Real and rawIn Precious  one of the years best movies a teacher challenges her students to use the word ""relentless"" in a sentence.Astonishing performances by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe left and comic MoNique as her cruel mother add humanity good and bad to a bleak tale.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 20 2009Starring Gabourey Sidibe MoNique Paula Patton Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz. Director Lee Daniels. 109 minutes. Scotiabank Varsity theatres. 14AIn Precious one of the years best movies a teacher challenges her students to use the word ""relentless"" in a sentence.They have to think about it but we dont. The simple answer is right before our horrified eyes.Precious is relentless. Set in the bleak Harlem of 1987 its unyielding in the appalling ills it heaps upon Claireece (Precious) Jones an illiterate and morbidly obese 16-year-old who wouldnt know good luck if it smacked her in the head. Played with astonished grace by newcomer Gabourey (Gabby) Sidibe the teen uses silence and surliness to shut out the world. But she cant hide the shocking fact of her condition shes pregnant for the second time again the result of rape by her own father. Shes about to be kicked out of school allegedly for being a classroom disruption - although shes the one who must bear the cruel taunts of her classmates.Article Continued BelowPrecious gets no relief at home from her mother Mary (comic MoNique another revelation) a figure out of a Grand Guignol nightmare who treats her daughter as both slave and despised cur. Mary lifts her eyes from the TV just long enough to upbraid Precious for some trivial complaint and to demand refills of food drink and cigarettes. When her sharp tongue fails to get the required response Mary administers slaps or hurls objects at Precious who stoically takes the abuse. Precious also endured in silence her many rapes which her mother did nothing to stop.These are not the end of Preciouss woes not by a long shot.The picture painted by director Lee Daniels is almost unbearably bleak but it feels completely honest. Its indeed relentless but also transfixing and ultimately transformative.Working with a screenplay by fresh pen Geoffrey Fletcher which is based on the novel by the poet Sapphire (a former Harlem schoolteacher) Daniels finds humanity within the suffering.He employs unique camera angles to relieve the urban gloom making the lens at times seem like a child staring at the world in wonder. He makes effective use of magic realism incorporating scenes where Precious allows her fertile imagination to see herself as a star and a success not a dim bulb and a failure.There are people who want to help Precious and theyre played by a supporting cast that is completely right. Paula Patton (Deja vu) a teacher in an alternative school offers hope for an education free of harassment. A social worker (Mariah Carey) and a nurse (Lenny Kravitz) provide tough love but also concrete assistance. Preciouss new classmates played by a mixed crew of hues and humours act like real students rather than cliches.Note the emphasis on musicians in the film like Carey and Kravitz. Normally that spells trouble in a drama since talents vary from disc to screen but each dazzles. Carey and Kravitz have only about 10 minutes of screen time apiece yet they convey fully realized characters and Carey is front and centre in the movies most searing moment. Daniels faith in his risky casting is rewarded and then some especially with the choice of Sidibe in the title role. With no previous screen experience and very little in the way of prior acting she commands every frame never allowing pity to cloud the strength of her performance. Shes even able to smile on occasion as when she ruefully observes that if things are looking up then a piano must be about fall out of the sky on her like in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon. All hail newcomer Gabourey Sidibe and may awards rain gold upon her.As Precious has made its way from Sundance discovery to Toronto celebration to likely Oscar glory some have begun to accuse it of overstating its case or exploiting extreme behaviour. Does it unfairly demonize the black urban experience? Not according to Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry who signed on as producers and who have boosted the film at every turn. They understand as should we that its wrong to look at Precious strictly in terms of race. Its not just about being black. Its about being human and thats the most relentless thing of all.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Some unforgettable stories come from characters traveling the distance of baby steps. Case in point ""Precious"" an engrossing portrait of a marginalized Harlem schoolgirl. Precious Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) begins her journey trapped in an abyss of inner-city poverty and abuse. We leave her on a hushed note of expectancy. The film is not a wallow in pathos but a rare and remarkable call to empathy. At 16 Precious is self-isolated depressed to the point of shutdown. She is near-illiterate obese and impregnated for the second time by her father. Shes taunted and shoved by her equally maladjusted peers. In fantasy sequences Precious flees to a vacuous dreamland of stardom glamour and handsome boys. She has so much self-loathing that when she primps at her bedroom mirror her reflection is a lithe blonde. Initially we cant read much on Sidibes impassive face; director Lee Daniels hints shes deeper than we assume. Notice the color-coordinated plastic necklaces she wears with her shabby school clothes. The girl has an eye for beauty. Daniels (who produced ""Monsters Ball"") carries us into Precious tawdry world with pungent realism. Hes a masterful filmmaker fully in command of troubling taboo-tackling material. He addresses issues such as petty crime welfare fraud and emotional physical and sexual abuse with candor. Working from a low-budget documentary aesthetic he gives every shot the tang of unflinching objectivity. Closeups show the actors blemished skin. When Precious prepares meals for her harridan mother Mary (MoNique) you smell the rancid grease in the frying pan. This resolute adherence to authenticity extends to the characters painful emotional lives. Mary reigns over their squalid apartment like the queen of hell. She keeps Precious on hand only to protect her welfare stipend and run her errands subjecting the girl to barbaric cruelty. Part of the films power is that it sees the vestiges of humanity in this monster. Mary knows her best years have gone. She feels a twisted sexual jealousy toward her daughter. Those are merely explanations for Marys cruelty; they dont excuse her. Lionsgate Star Tribune Gabourey Sidibe in ""Precious"" In the same spirit Daniels refuses to douse Precious with tragic nobility. Shes a petty thief a seriously underskilled mother and for much of the film a passive victim. Despite the films clear social conscience and sympathy for the community it portrays ""Precious"" never panders for compassion. This is not a film about sociology. Its a platform for uncommonly truthful acting and thats what Daniels gets from his performers. MoNique is menacing in emotionally jagged scenes where Mary attacks Precious for ""stealing"" her man. This is not the kind of turn where you understand the character because its artfully written and vibrantly enacted. You believe MoNique because you accept that her characters behavior is coming from some haywire rats nest of damaged brain circuitry. In her more restrained role Sidibe is an out-of-nowhere phenomenon. She can anchor a scene just by walking in. Mariah Carey goes convincingly washed-out and drab-haired as a sympathetic welfare official. ""Precious"" has a raw uncompromising tone but its not an unrelenting agony bath. Solid laughs are hidden where you dont expect them. Precious complains about crack dealers ""givin the ghetto a bad name."" Her schoolmates antic misbehavior is amusing without being movie-cute. When Precious transfers to a remedial school a team of battle-weary but committed teachers and caseworkers help her begin to change her life. There are crushing setbacks along the way; one good year cant erase a lifetime of fractured relationships. Her teacher Ms. Rain (empathetic Paula Patton) encourages Precious to exorcise her demons by writing her story. Its a tentative stride down the path to adult responsibility hinting at the possibility of redemption in a coldhearted world. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

In his loony debut film Shadowboxer he established gangster Stephen Dorffs wealth by cutting repeatedly to a shot of zebras in his front lawn. But wildly--and seemingly implausibly--his heavy-handedness works in Precious. After all no one else in this Harlem drama cries screams or smiles for the abused teen. Shes not even willing to do it for herself. 300-lb Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) uses her blunt face and weight as a wall. We get the sense shes padded herself for protection against her mother (MoNique) mostly but also the boys on the block and the father who rapes her whenever he bothers to come home. Mom piles on. When MoNique finds excuses to force-feed her daughter we suspect its really her misdirected scheme to make her less of a sexual threat. MoNique and Sidibe are astounding and you can feel Daniels struggling to trust his mighty goddesses to carry the film. (He wedges in shots of boiling pigs feet to make sure were queasy.) As Ms. Rain the tutor who encourages Precious to reach out through writing Paula Patton is one Coolio track away from playing Michelle Pfeiffer. But the diva in Mariah Carey gets her small turn as an overburdened social worker note perfect she cares but shes got other priorities. The sheltered suburban girl in me wants to say this shattering film needs us to feel not learn. It leaves you reaching for a hankie not a volunteer form. And then this week like many weeks the news tells us of 5-year-old Shaniya Davis sold by her mom and killed by her buyer. And a film that feels like melodrama stabs us with its truth. And it hurts. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

""Im going to break through or someone is going to break through to me."" To say that she eventually gets her wish - sort of - doesnt spoil a thing This bruising harrowing movie would be impossible to sit through without at least a hint of light at the end of its astonishingly dark tunnel. Director Lee Daniels and screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher dont just want to show you the sad lot of Precious (played by terrific newcomer Gabourey Sibide). They also want to make you feel her day-to-day misery whether its the sexual abuse of her father (as the movie opens shes pregnant with his second child; the first was born with Down Syndrome) the physical and emotional abuse of her monstrous mother (comedian MoNique in a revelatory performance of evil personified); her low self-esteem (shes obese and looking in the mirror imagines a pretty thin white girl staring back) or her illiteracy which she keeps from her classmates. Set in Harlem in 1987 (which seems a century before the areas ethnic assimilation a time when the idea of an African-American president would have been risible) Precious stacks the deck so high against its protagonist that in almost any other movie she would come off as a helpless victim. But for all her pain and suffering Precious is alive and imaginative and resourceful (she fantasizes about being famous and glamorous and she imagines running off with her math teacher and living happily in the suburbs). The question hanging over the movie is whether the girl will ever get a chance to set free the spirit within her Pain and hopelessness have a way of dousing even the most innocent ambition. The plot which at times feels like a fairy tale with no imaginable happy ending follows what happens after Precious connects with a teacher (Paula Patton) at an alternative school who understands the formidable hurdles that must be overcome before the girl can even think of things like learning to read and a social worker (an unrecognizable Mariah Carey) who gradually grasps the severity of her situation. Daniels whose previous film Shadowboxer sailed so cheerfully over the top that sometimes you couldnt believe what you were seeing is not timid about putting the audience - and his characters - through the wringer. His direction at times edges into the heavy handed but the movie is not timid about wanting to induce a reaction. Sequences centering on the girls time at home alone with her mother induce gasps because they ring so true even though you cant imagine a parent who would behave so vilely toward her daughter. Near the end of the film MoNique makes the best of a monologue guaranteed to bring her a Best Supporting Actress nomination in which her character reveals a glimpse of humanity that while not redemptive (this character is unredeemable) speaks to the storys central theme. Precious mother gave up on life long ago and her seething voracious anger is a result of her weakness. Despite all the insurmountable obstacles in her way and despite countless motivations to give up her daughter refuses to do so. That hope - in the movie as in life - makes all the difference.

Precious (Gabourey Sidibe left) and Ms. Rain (Paula Patton right) in PRECIOUS BASED ON THE NOVEL PUSH BY SAPPHIRE. Photo Anne Marie Fox Lionsgate Precious Searing look at despair resilience 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Precious Drama. Starring Gabourey Sidibe and MoNique. Directed by Lee Daniels. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Precious"" is a movie about an obese Harlem teenager whos raped by her father and abused by her mother. Its depressing devastating harrowing and repulsive. But there are lyric flights of hope interspersed among that raw naturalism and thats what makes this movie amazing. Directed by Lee Daniels and adapted by Geoffrey Fletcher from the novel ""Push"" by Sapphire ""Precious"" is arguably the hardest-hitting depiction of childhood incest to find widespread mainstream distribution. The film looks squarely at the graphic emotional contours of sexual abuse whether its the sweaty face of the man who impregnates his daughter or the twisted psychological battery of the woman who enables him. Yet Daniels mixes up the harsh urban drama with episodes of magical realism moments when the title character cuts away from the horrors of abuse into a fantasy world of glamorous photo shoots and red-carpet schmoozing. In that realm shes adored. In the real world shes raped and reviled. The contrast between idealized and real emphasizes the unforgiving grittiness of Precious life - the crackheads in the projects the mother who hates her guts - but it also plays up the resilience of a girl who hasnt yet given up on loving or being loved. At one point Precious looks in the mirror and imagines a skinny blonde a glimpse of self-loathing that might have been torn from Toni Morrisons ""The Bluest Eye."" Bit by bit in a messy progression of choices confrontations and setbacks hope insinuates itself into the plot. And the cast is perfection Gabourey Sidibe as the heroic Precious; MoNique as her contemptible pathetic mother; Paula Patton as a kind teacher in a new school; Mariah Carey incognito in drab bangs as a no-guff welfare caseworker. Even Lenny Kravitz impresses as a charming maternity nurse. ""Precious"" counts among its producers Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry - and cynics may be tempted to dismiss it as pop exploitation of a sensitive topic. It isnt. It is first and foremost a compassionate closely observed study of a traumatized adolescent. Yet this isnt just any portrait of a pregnant teen. With innocence force of will and a welling largeness of heart Sidibe conveys both the child Precious was and the adult she wants to be. What a quiet feat of acting. What a triumph of a film. -- Advisory Child abuse including sexual assault and pervasive profanity.

Starring Gabourey Sidibe MoNique Paula Patton Mariah Carey Sherri Shepherd Lenny Kravitz Director Lee Daniels Running time 149 Release Opened Nov 13 2009  Editorial Review Precious mettleBy Ann HornadayFriday Nov. 13 2009Movies come movies go. But a rare few arrive like gifts sent by some cosmic messenger to stir the senses awaken compassion and send viewers into a world made radically new by invigorated alertness and empathy. Such is the movie ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire"" which surely qualifies as the most painful poetic and improbably beautiful film of the year.Its hard to believe that a movie that traffics so operatically in images of brutality and squalor can be so fleet assured and lyrical. But such breathtaking contradictions abound in ""Precious"" which in the course of introducing the viewers to unspeakable despair manages to imbue them with an exhilarating sense of hope -- if not in a bright and cheery future for the films beleaguered protagonist then at least in the possibilities of cinema as a bold fluent and adamantly expressive art form.That beleaguered protagonist is Claireece ""Precious"" Jones (played in an astonishing debut by Gabourey Sidibe) a 16-year-old girl who as the movie opens is still attending junior high school in 1980s Harlem. Morbidly obese functionally illiterate pregnant with her second child after being raped by her father Precious lives with her mother Mary (MoNique) in a squalid apartment where she endures the latters near-constant verbal physical and sexual abuse. Preciouss only escape from this lurid tableau is rich glittery fantasy life in which she has a ""light-skinned boyfriend"" and ""good hair"" dresses in ball gowns and carries a little terrier.Precious is numb shut down locked behind protective layers of fat and clothing her hooded eyes nearly sightless slits. Shes invisible even to herself When she looks in the mirror a blond blue-eyed teenager gazes back. But when an attentive principal enrolls her in an alternative education program Preciouss mountainlike passivity and self-abnegation begin to give way to tiny seismic temblors of transformation.Adapted from a 1996 novel by the poet Sapphire ""Precious"" has been a hit on the film festival circuit earning a clutch of audience awards -- and at Sundance earlier this year the support of Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry who signed on as executive producers.Director Lee Daniels (""Shadowboxer"") working from a script by Geoffrey Fletcher doesnt flinch from confronting viewers with the most squalid violent depredations Precious suffers at her mothers hands. But he instinctively knows when to offer viewers and his heroine much-needed relief by way of brightly lit sumptuously staged magical realist sequences portraying Preciouss glitzy daydreams. He pulls off this audacious balancing act throughout ""Precious"" which toes a vertiginous line between the grim and highly stylized.But as adroitly as Daniels handles the multilayered details textures and tones of ""Preciouss"" rich visual design his most crucial task is giving his cast the space needed to deliver revelatory searingly honest performances. Sidibes nuanced deeply sympathetic portrayal of a character who is almost completely inert for most of the movie recalls Billy Bob Thorntons highly praised breakout turn in ""Sling Blade.""Technically hers is a far more difficult role than the toxic rage-fueled monster brought to life by MoNique who delivers a performance that constantly teeters on the edge of going over the top but somehow manages to stay on the side of credibility. MoNique best known and loved for her persona as a stand-up comedienne and comic actress is rightly being praised for a brave performance untouched by vanity.Together she and Sidibe form a formidable dyad that gives ""Precious"" its dysfunctional centrifugal force. But the entire enterprise is best appreciated as a bracing ensemble piece in which even the smallest roles harmonize flawlessly within the whole. The gorgeous Paula Patton breathes radiant but bone-weary life into what could have been a stock character of the tireless English teacher. Rather than the reassuring reversals of a miracle worker or ""I can reach these kids"" speeches her character Ms. Rain wrings incremental victories from a world proscribed by Rolodex contacts and bureaucratic red tape. And not one but two pop stars prove their dramatic bona fides in ""Precious"" Lenny Kravitz as a cute compassionate hospital nurse and Mariah Carey in a mousy wig and devoid of makeup delivering a frank utterly winning performance as a seen-it-all social worker.""What does it mean when the author describes the protagonists circumstances as unrelenting?"" Ms. Rain asks at one point. Thats precisely the question posed by ""Precious"" in which the title character withstands such a constant plague of social ills that shes in danger of becoming little more than a simplistically drawn even grotesque poster child. (The same can be said for MoNiques Mary who in many ways embodies all-too-familiar stereotypes of welfare queens and the pathology of poverty.)That ""Precious"" dodges these toxic assumptions even while coming perilously close to perpetuating them is a testament not only to the sensitivity and artistry of Danielss filmmaking but also to the fierce performances of actors who rather than skimming the surface of their characters invariably dive ever deeper inside taking viewers with them.That journey winds up being excruciating exhausting and against all odds deeply rewarding. Just how rewarding probably will become clear to viewers when they emerge from ""Precious"" to find that life outside the theater has come into a different kind of focus. ""Precious"" performs the same miracle as every great work of art It gives its viewers new eyes and the sense that theyll never see the world -- or the people in it -- in quite the same way.Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire (109 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for child abuse including sexual assault and pervasive profanity.

At least once on the bus youve recoiled from another passenger. Maybe it was the waxy skin or the vacant expression or the inarticulate voice. You just didnt want to know from her. Or maybe you thought you knew all there was to know.Precious is such a girl. She is 16 morbidly obese and illiterate. She wont look you in the eyes because she cant bear to see you avert them. She doesnt have the words to communicate that how she looks isnt who she is. And even if she did she would be unintelligible. They taunt her at school but thats a step up from how they brutalize her at home.Harrowing and marked by heroic performances Lee Daniels Precious looks squarely in the wounded eyes of its title character and sees a girl with poetry in her. Poetry and also a fetus conceived in rape by her father. (Dont ask where her mother was because youre not going to like the answer beating up on baby girl for stealing Mommas man.)The producer of Monsters Ball and director of Shadowboxer Daniels gravitates to scenarios with characters who are in a very dark place and move incrementally toward the light. In Sapphires novel Push set in 1987 he found a character in the darkest place imaginable chained to abusive parents and lacking the key to free herself.Dramatically Daniels films are akin to sensitivity-training setups that encourage viewers to walk a mile in anothers shoes. His movies are hopeful insofar as they deliver their characters from excruciating mental agony to ordinary misery.In other words you go to a Daniels movie not to be entertained but edified. While not everyone goes to the movies for self-improvement you will leave this one having witnessed phenomenal acting.As Precious caged by ignorance and liberated by empathy Gabourey Sidibe takes the audience from dehumanization to purpose. If the film is inspirational its because we see her emotional detachment jolted by the power surge of human connection.In any drama a hero is only as compelling as the villain and man does Precious ever have one in MoNique (the comedian) unsmiling as Mary Precious mother. In their Harlem apartment painted in hues of grease smoke when not stewing in her own toxic juices Mary repeatedly violates Precious. Verbally. Physically. Sexually.MoNiques performance is unnerving and pungent. Mary has no visible maternal feelings for Precious viewing her daughter primarily as the messenger of welfare checks preparer of food and receiving end for aggression.It is not hard to see how Precious came to her benumbed state. Still it is hard to watch. Sullen pitiless and opportunistic Mary views Precious pregnancy as a shot at a bigger welfare check.The pregnancy her second gets Precious expelled from ninth grade. The pregnancy is also instrumental in Precious finding her voice her life and love for children. Because it leads to a steadfast teacher and a stalwart social worker entering Precious life teenage pregnancy turns out to be a good thing.At the alternative school Each One Teach One Precious enrolls in the class of Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) the Fairy Godmother who gets the urban Cinderella up from domestic slavery by teaching her to read and write the keys to freedom.But it is a social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey careworn and almost unrecognizable) who facilitates the films emotional catharsis. By making Mary face Precious and use words instead of fists Ms. Weiss helps Precious get beyond her abusive past.Daniels and screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher structure the narrative in terms of gestation and delivery. In other words Precious gives birth to both baby and baby self. But the implicit moral that it takes a village to raise a child to raise her children feels manufactured.The searing performances from MoNique and Sidibe suggest another interpretation that it takes real empathy to create such portraits of resignation and hope.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

ABOUT THE MOVIEPrecious   out of four Stars Gabourey Sidibe MoNique Paula Patton Mariah Carey Lenny KravitzDirector Lee DanielsDistributor Lionsgate FilmsRating R for child abuse including sexual assault and pervasive languageRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its a big week for redemption. PROFILES Meet the four women of Precious Though their tales are worlds and centuries apart two films grapple with soul-killing pain and financial privation. Theres the old-shoe familiarity of A Christmas Carol with its well-worn message of a codger who learns the value of generosity and kindness. And theres Precious the blisteringly raw account of a 16-year-old girl from Harlem abused in every conceivable way who learns to rise above her achingly terrible life. While Charles Dickens chronicled the sagas of the poor and miserable in 19th century England Precious based on the novel Push by Sapphire takes contemporary poverty and misery and lays it bare. Both films mean to uplift but Precious does so with far more grit. The result is often so disturbing and relentlessly bleak that its painful to watch. Scenes of abuse elicit audience gasps and yells. But the story of Clareeice ""Precious"" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) is a powerful one. Misfortune is piled upon the stoic dangerously overweight Precious to the point of toppling - and the storys credibility suffers at times staggering under the weight of its litany of vicissitudes. It is saved by the strong performances of its nearly all-female cast and in particular by MoNiques shattering portrayal of the most vile narcissistic mother imaginable. Director Lee Daniels eclectic filmmaking style mitigates some of the audiences pain. He intersperses the grim drama shot in darker tones often with a handheld camera with Precious escapist fantasies drenched in vivid color and tinged with humor. Though its sometimes jarring its as if he senses our psychic battering and offers solace just when we need it most. Precious as played by Sidibe is impassive even stony. But as we hear her internal monologue in a voice-over narration it is clear plenty is going on behind her expressionless eyes. She hides behind a bland affect for sheer survival as her mother degrades her. She endures unspeakable physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her monstrous father (Rodney Bear Jackson). When the story opens Precious pregnant with her second child is expelled from school. Though 16 shes in middle school and can barely read. In a segment that strains credibility a school administrator calls upon Precious at the grim apartment she shares with her mother urging her to attend an alternative school that offers more personal instruction. Precious begins learning to read and write thanks to the dedication of her teacher Blu Rain (Paula Patton). A compassionate social worker (Mariah Carey in a startlingly subtle performance) helps Precious gain strength. The dialogue by screenwriter Damien Paul can be refreshingly honest. When Rain takes Precious to stay temporarily at the home she shares with her girlfriend Precious muses ""They talk like TV stations I dont watch."" Its not hard to understand why this film won the Grand Jury and Audience awards at the Sundance Film Festival. Its hard to be unmoved by Precious determination. Despite its melodramatic moments remarkable performances drive home the films inspiring message.

"Precious cuts deep - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-CutsMOVIE REVIEW Precious cuts deepThe heartbreaking hopeful tale of an abused pregnant teen should not be missed.November 06 2009|Betsy Sharkey | Film Critic Nothing quite prepares you for the rough-cut diamond that is ""Precious."" A rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary this shockingly raw surprisingly irreverent and absolutely unforgettable story of an obese illiterate pregnant black Harlem teen circa 1987 is one that you hope will not be dismissed as too difficult because it should not be missed.""Precious Based on the novel Push by Sapphire"" will challenge you but it will also move you as it rocks between the horrific realities and escapist fantasies of 16-year-old Claireece Precious Jones (impressive newcomer Gabourey Sidibe) with a life so besieged that a mothers rage and a fathers rapes are what passes for love.At first glance there is little that seems precious about Precious whose 330 pounds and constant scowl is cross-the-street intimidating. But then filmmaker Lee Daniels who is known for producing tough films on tough subjects -- ""Monsters Ball"" and ""The Woodsman"" among them -- is not about to go soft on this story.""Push"" poet/performance artist Sapphires first novel was a sensation when it landed in 1996 for its graphically told story of the verbal physical and particularly the sexual abuse experienced by Precious who narrates in such fractured English that at first its like another language.Working with screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher Daniels has lightened the story a few shades by creating many fantasy sequences not found in the book which is not to say theyve made ""Precious"" easy to watch just easier.In a no-child-left-behind world Precious was lost long before she could be left. No self-esteem to speak of she tries for invisibility. At school its easier no one is really interested. At home shes got a soul-destroying nightmare of a mother who has made Precious her project. Played to fearless and godless perfection by MoNique Mary spends her days in front of the TV while hurling a steady stream of invective -- along with the occasional frying pan -- in her daughters direction.Hope should not exist in all that despair but Precious turns out to be an odds-defying storm that batters the emotions shakes the soul and still manages to put a silver lining on the blackest of clouds in ways you might not have thought possible.When the school counselor discovers Precious is pregnant the story begins its painful descent into the world of Americas underclass. There is no safety net for Precious -- her family social services and the educational system have all failed her.Like the book the dialogue is graphic and politically incorrect. Precious first child a daughter is called Little Mongo because of her Down syndrome. When the teenager finds one of her teachers is a ""straight-up lesbian"" she says so before going on to list all the things homosexuals havent done to her. With Mary meanwhile its not so much the words themselves that shock though it sometimes seems her vocabulary doesnt extend beyond four-letter words but the molten lava underneath them.Fortunately for us Precious has a very rich and playful imagination. When bad things happen and they so often do the images dissolve into music video moments or in one case a Sophia Loren film where Precious is loved respected and always in the spotlight. While reality is Harlem gritty her fantasies are mostly glam and glitz and like dreams vanish all too soon.This second pregnancy turns out to be her salvation with Precious transferred to an alternative learning program. Her teacher Blu Rain (Paula Patton) begins to change her life by getting Precious and the other rainbow coalition of failures in the class to write about their lives.(Xosha Roquemore as the sassy gum-smacking Joann is a total kick).Most of the characters are a study in restraint. Mariah Carey sans makeup and minis is almost unrecognizable and a pleasant surprise as the tough New York social worker who eventually gets Precious case. Patton who could have gone overly teary as Precious past emerges instead keeps pushing her to succeed giving the sentiment when it comes a potent spareness. That the director trusts us to find the emotional peaks and valleys on our own is one of the films grace notes.The power on the screen and it is substantial is shared by MoNique and Sidibe with the director leading them to the brink in scene after scene. Sidibe does well moving between the mumbling wall of insecurity that is Precious and the polished preening celebrity of her dreams.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCalifornia in retreat on social service spendingJanuary 7 2012As top Bell officials earned massive salaries city workers...July 27 2010Lee Daniels director of PreciousDecember 23 2009A mixed blessing for Madagascar townJanuary 13 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTCutsPreciousSapphireCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-precious6-2009nov06,0,6535473.story",200,"preciousbasedonthenovel""push""bysapphire16","preciousbasedonthenovel""push""bysapphire",latimes

Shes 16 morbidly obese and illiterate. She lives in 1987 Harlem with her abusive welfare-scamming couch-potato mother. Oh and shes already pregnant for the second time -- by her AIDS-afflicted father. Meet Claireece Precious Jones the unlikely heroine of Lee Daniels wrenching and uplifting ""Precious"" which has been wowing both critics and audiences on the festival circuit since January. Believe the hype. Ignore the fact that it is being ""presented"" by Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry neither of whom had anything to do with the films making and seem determined to market ""Precious"" with the politics of victimhood. While its not always easy to watch and occasionally succumbs to melodramatic excess and stereotype you miss ""Precious"" -- mercifully free of the artery-clogging schmaltz in the not dissimilar ""The Color Purple"" -- at your peril. Adapted from the novel ""Push"" by a former teacher who calls herself Sapphire this movie offers the inspirational tale of how Precious finds hope after shes assigned to an alternative school where a kindly lesbian teacher (Paula Patton) encourages her to study and to keep a journal. This doesnt sit well with Precious foulmouthed mother Mary who prefers to be waited on in their squalid apartment on Lenox Avenue and forces Precious to eat when Mary is unhappy about a meals preparation. Mary who uses Precious and her first developmentally damaged child as a meal ticket harbors a simmering hatred of her daughter because she argues Precious father ""preferred"" the daughter from the age of 3. This is something we see in sickening detail -- at least until Daniels mercifully if not subtly cuts away to food sizzling in a skillet. Daniels handles his actors with great skill though. Newcomer Gabourey Sidibe is a magnetic presence as the blossoming Precious who is dazed when she gets to deliver her second child in an actual hospital instead of on her mothers kitchen floor. The literally knockout performance here -- a lock for an Oscar nomination -- is the comedian MoNique as the self-absorbed Mary. MoNiques considerable accomplishment is that she manages to make you feel even a scintilla of sympathy for this monster who throws a TV set down a flight of stairs at her daughter and newborn grandson. Daniels even manages to draw a highly effective performance out of a severely de-glamorized Mariah Carey (complete with faint mustache) as a sympathetic but tough social worker who has to referee a climactic showdown between the newly empowered Precious and Mary. ""Precious"" balances all this darkness with light moments including some joking around with Precious classmates a possible love interest (Lenny Kravitz) and the glitzy showbiz fantasies into which Precious periodically flees. To its credit this remarkable film does not contrive a happy ending. Under the circumstances even a mildly hopeful one seems like a triumph of the highest order. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Game 6 scores high TV ratings Read Next Game 6 scores high TV ratings Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 39253 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20278 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 13983 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

BY Daily News Staff Updated Friday November 6 2009 1256 PM Title Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire A pregnant teen struggles to survive in 1980s Harlem. With MoNique Gabourey Sidibe Mariah Carey. Director Lee Daniels (150). R Language severe child abuse. At area theaters. You dont have to be a teenager living in Harlem to appreciate ""Precious."" You dont have to be illiterate or obese. You dont even have to know how it feels to be repeatedly let down by the very people meant to protect you. But you do need an open mind because without firsthand experience youll have to trust that girls like Precious -- lovable but unloved -- do exist. Youll need an open heart as well to believe that beauty can survive in the face of so much ugliness. As imagined by novelist Sapphire and director Lee Daniels Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) was born to be destroyed. Her mother (MoNique) abuses her in every imaginable way. Her school ignores her. Her classmates taunt her. Her body well over 300 pounds both protects and betrays her. She is 16 and about to give birth to her fathers child for the second time. Into this bleak corner of New York circa 1987 comes Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) a teacher determined to save lives others dismiss. In her class Precious finds the slightest glimmers of hope. Believe me when I say ""slightest."" Daniels digs obstinately downward and the primary moments of relief come from Precious fantasy life. So why is everyone talking about this movie? Well it doesnt hurt to have Oprah and Tyler Perry both executive producers on your side. But the films real strength is its cast from an Oscar-bound MoNique to a notably deglammed Mariah Carey (as an overwhelmed social worker). The actress who most deserves credit however is the one we dont already know first-timer Sidibe. Daniels is not a subtle director and he encourages MoNiques powerful expansiveness. But its much harder to act quietly than loudly as Sidibe must do and her still grace should not be mistaken for blankness. She provides the faintly beating heart of this movie muted enough to overlook but strong enough to keep everything going. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

(Courtesy of Lionsgate) The first 20 minutes of ""Precious"" the full title of which is ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire"" are so intense and pitched so high you may not feel like sticking it out. My advice Stick it out. This is an exceptional film about nearly unendurable circumstances endured. You will come out the other side of it a markedly enriched filmgoer. The story of Claireece ""Precious"" Jones"" tells of a New York City teenager living in 1980s Harlem raped by her barely glimpsed father abused by her unfathomably cruel mother. Precious is illiterate but bright and against her mothers wishes she switches to an alternative school where in a literacy workshop she comes under the life-saving tutelage of Ms. Rain (Paula Patton). The 16-year-old Precious has one child and another on the way both by her own father. Her life (and director Lee Daniels wrenching film) becomes a mosaic of pain and promise sunny skies and grief with enough of an emotional impact to put a dent in the most jaded audience. The novel was published in 1996. Screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher has toned down some of the miseries inflicted on Precious but this is no whitewash on the order of the film version of ""The Color Purple"" (a book referenced directly in Sapphires original). It is true to its source and only in the coda do we feel as if were getting more affirmation than the protagonists narrative circumstances support. The film is rough around the edges but fantastically well-acted and truly alive. The miracle of the ensemble is that it does in fact feel like an ensemble. Newcomer Gabourey Sidibe plays Precious and she is phenomenally expressive in her portrayal of a huge young woman shouldering a massive amount of adversity. MoNique plays the pivotal role of Precious vicious mother -- Ronald Reagans nightmare vision of a ""welfare queen"" come to life. Some have claimed this portrayal comes too close to minstrelsy for comfort. God knows MoNique is asked to do some pretty horrible things but ""Precious"" keeps this character just this side of cardboard monstrosity. Therell be an Oscar nomination or two in this films near future. And Mariah Carey -- who knew the pop diva had such a good honest clean performance in her? She plays a social worker and in a couple of lengthy interactions Carey and Sidibe find common performance ground where you wouldnt think any existed. Daniels allows himself the fantasy outlet of Precious imagination When the sexual violence (or other kinds of violence) gets to be too much the young woman escapes into herself and we see her on-screen as she dreams herself to be all dolled up on the fashion runway or attending some paparazzi-laden premiere. Some of the visualizations are conventionally realized but the necessity of such scenes is clear. Still ""Precious"" is at its best when it spends time in the classroom and when we get to know a host of tough smart characters on their own terms. These sequences rival those in the recent French film ""The Class."" We root for these survivors not because theyre being set up as rooting interests by the filmmakers but because their back-and-forth is so sharp and vivid and dynamic. These supporting characters keep the movie hopping. Its not an easy film to watch. But neither for many reasons is ""Precious"" easy to forget.

For years I thought the majority of people on welfare were minorities until a sociology class revealed it was Caucasians. How were those Mormon polygamies surviving? Welfare. Posted by Sandy Bailey | December 15 2009 at 0919 PM Funny when I think ""welfare queen"" now I think of a Wall Street banker taking the governments money and spending it on his own bonus. Posted by Andrew | November 06 2009 at 0406 PM Reagan harped on ""welfare queens"" quite a bit. I knew exactly what Phillips meant as soon as I read it. Posted by Roscoe | November 06 2009 at 0810 AM Reagan-era rhetoric did convince a lot of people--inaccurately--that their tax dollars mostly go to support Cadillac-driving welfare queens with big-screen TVs in their housing project-living rooms. And the type of people willing to buy into that notion didnt care to fact check that the percentage of the annual US budget that provides assistance to dependent families is minuscule in comparison to that of say defense. Funny how Wall St. and the banking industry turned out to be the biggest welfare queens I know of . . . . Posted by billyjoe | November 06 2009 at 0412 AM Your review was quite credible until the remark ""Ronald Reagans nightmare vision of a ""welfare queen"" come to life"" ... methinks youre projecting your own prejudices here Posted by Sue Bergenstein | November 05 2009 at 0339 PM The comments to this entry are closed.

Disney By Joe Morgenstern Updated Nov. 6 2009 1201 a.m. ET To put it bluntly if Scroogely Disneys 3-D animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is a calamity. The pace is predominantly glacial--that alone would be enough to cook the goose of this premature holiday turkey--and the tone is joyless despite an extended passage of bizarre laughter several dazzling flights of digital fancy a succession of striking images and Jim Carreys voicing of Scrooge plus half a dozen other roles. ""Why so coldhearted?"" Scrooges nephew Fred asks the old skinflint. The same question could be asked of Robert Zemeckis who adapted and directed the film and of the company that financed it. Why was simple pleasure frozen out of the production? Why does the beloved story feel embalmed by technology? And why are its characters as insubstantial as the snowflakes that seem to be falling on the audience? A catch-all answer--and by now an all-too-familiar one--lies in the unnature of that technology. Like ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"" which were also directed by Mr. Zemeckis ""A Christmas Carol"" employs a motion-capture process that translates the movements of live actors into fantasy images. For its advocates the process is cost-efficient and good enough. For its detractors including me motion capture has become synonymous with a special sort of semi-lifelessness--body language that is vaguely impoverished faces with limited mobility and dead eyes. In the global marketing push for his new film the director has dismissed such problems as essentially solved. But they havent been solved at all; theyve only been mitigated and partially masked by the novelty value of 3-D. Motion capture remains an impediment to capturing emotion. ""A Christmas Carol"" soars only when Scrooge is in temporal transit--one lyrical sequence flies him back to his boyhood village. And some of the action as well as a cataclysmic climax fueled by hellfires and hellwinds will scare little kids out of their little wits. Dickens framed his novella as a moral tale. Disney sells it as a thrill ride--""The Polar Express"" with a really bad Santa. Well its a free country and a public-domain property. Nevertheless you can almost see the various rooms on the Disneyland ride-to-be while the movie makes its way from Victorian past to fun-house future. (Maybe the rides sound design-to-be is why the Ghost of Christmas Present laughs so long and maniacally.) In the turgid stretches between action sequences the drama or whats left of it makes its way with such ponderous self-important artistry that Scrooges present threatens to become an eternity. This sad excuse for family entertainment tries to enshrine a classic while defacing it. Precious ENLARGE Gabourey Sidibe in Precious Lionsgate One of the most telling moments of a shockingly beautiful film called ""Precious"" comes toward the end and its hardly more than a throwaway--the heroine glances at a mirror and sees herself. Until then mirrors have reflected her desperate fantasies of who she might be--a svelte blonde a bejeweled black dancer or cover girl. Thats because Claireece ""Precious"" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) has found the sight of her physical self--like the plight of her spiritual self--unendurable. A 16-year-old African-American in the Harlem of 1987 she is mountainously obese sexually and psychically abused illiterate almost mute and pregnant with her second child. The drama begins by giving her spirit voice--its another notion of ""A Beautiful Mind""--and follows her growth from a rageful child with a turbulent inner life to a formidable young woman with a life full of promise and hope. The full contractual title of the film which was directed by Lee Daniels is ""Precious Based on the Novel Push By Sapphire."" (Geoffrey Fletcher did the screen adaptation.) In addition to striking a blow for books and the written word the title serves as a reminder that ""Precious"" is a work of fiction by the African-American poet who calls herself Sapphire and something of a fantasy in its own right--an inspirational fable about the power of kindness and caring. (The producers include Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry.) ENLARGE George Clooney below is one of the stars of The Men Who Stare at Goats. Overture Films Thats not to diminish the fables value only to note the near-saintly devotion of an alternative-school teacher Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) and a social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey) and to acknowledge the time-lapse pace of the heroines blossoming under their care. ""Precious"" is genuinely and irresistibly inspirational. If the filmmaking werent so skillful and the acting werent so consistently brilliant you might mistake this production for a raw slice of life from a Third World country where movies can still be instruments of moral instruction and social change. If Ms. Sidibe werent playing the title role its hard to imagine what ""Precious"" would be. She doesnt play it she invades and conquers it with concentrated energy and blithe humor. (Referring to the sophisticated Ms. Rain and her lesbian partner Precious says ""They talk like a TV channel I dont watch."") And shes not the only spectacular attraction. The comedienne and actress MoNique is stunningly effective as the heroines monstrous mother Mary who makes a mockery of maternal instincts and comes undone in a ghastly confrontation that goes a long way toward explaining her monstrosity. This is a fine movie and a deep one. Its about unearthing buried treasure. The Men Who Stare at Goats ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" stars George Clooney Jeff Bridges Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey. All of them look like theyre having lots of fun and their enjoyment promises to be infectious. After a while though the only sign of infection may be an urge to squirm. You may wonder if this screen version of the book of the same name is as unfunny and strangely mushy as it seems but trust your instincts. Theres no solid ground beneath the story of a secret U.S. Army unit that was dedicated to developing psychic powers. Its a goof about a bunch of goofballs. Jon Ronson the books author said the story was true; ostensibly sane citizens really did try to create a force of American soldiers with superpowers warrior monks who could make themselves invisible walk through walls or as a training exercise if nothing else kill a goat by staring at it. Yet demonstrable truth wasnt the issue. The pleasures of the book came from the craziness of the schemes the fervor of the crackpots who devised them and the steady skepticism of the prose. In the movie which was directed by Grant Heslov from a screenplay by Peter Straughan the two main crackpots played by Mr. Clooney and Mr. Bridges have become arch charmers and the tone is New Age whimsy with absurdist overtones by way of the Coen brothers and Wes Anderson. One of the superpowers under study involves remote viewing via extrasensory perception. I wish I could have viewed this movie remotely or not at all. The Fourth Kind Here are two true things about Olatunde Osunsanmis ""The Fourth Kind."" In the opening scene the actress Milla Jovovich introduces herself as the actress Milla Jovovich which she is--actually she says ""I am actress Milla Jovovich""--and announces that she will play a psychologist named Abbey Tyler which she does. What may be less than true is the actresss announcement that Abbey is a real-life victim of alien abduction and that scenes showing the real Abbey along with corroborating evidence from her terrified patients have been taken from really real documentary footage. Here are five other truths confirmed by the film whose title dares to one-up Steven Spielbergs (close encounters of the fourth kind going beyond mere contact with aliens into abduction by them) 1) Mr. Spielbergs reputation is safe. 2) Jittery hand-held cameras cant create drama only nausea. 3) Mr. Osunsanmis chutzpah exceeds his skill. 4) Mr. Osunsanmi is skillful all the same having made something out of little more than a clever idea in the hallowed tradition of ""The Blair Witch Project"" plus a couple of truly scary moments. 5) In the age of the Internet everything is true unless proven otherwise so ""The Fourth Kind"" will abduct a scary share of this weeks audience. The Wedding Song ""The Wedding Song"" takes place in Tunis in 1942 just as Nazis troops are occupying the North African capital. Karin Albous sensuous leisurely drama doesnt explore the setting so much as draw subdued energy from it. The center of the story is occupied by two girls coming of age in fearful circumstances Nour (Olympe Borval) who is Muslim and her best friend Myriam (Lizzie Brochere) who is a Sephardic Jew. Each girl envies the others life and their envy is equally misguided since the man Nour hopes to marry cannot match her romantic expectations while Myriams religion and the wealthy man shes being forced to marry threaten to be her undoing. A small-scale feature made with modest resources ""The Wedding Song"" seeks and finds larger meaning as a multipurpose parable of the Nazi message of hate that divides cherished friends of oppressed Arabs misapprehending the roots of their oppression and blaming oppressed Jews. The movies distinction however lies in two lovely performances and in the passion and pain of parallel lives--both girls suffering at the hands of men both struggling to understand the brutality of the world they must share. In a DVD recommendation last week I mistakenly said that Leslie Caron won an Oscar for her performance in the title role of the 1953 ""Lili."" The best-actress Oscar that year was won by Audrey Hepburn for ""Roman Holiday."" DVD FOCUS ""A Christmas Carol""(1951) ENLARGE Just in case you were wondering or somehow forgot this is the definitive choice among all the feature versions extant (though I do have a soft spot for Bill Murrays ""Scrooged""). Alastair Sim gimlet-eyed and gleefully acidulous is Scrooge Mervyn Johns is Bob Cratchit Hermione Baddely is Mrs. Cratchit Kathleeen Harrison is Mrs. Dilber and Michael Hordern is Jacob Marley in the flesh and as a ghost. The director was Brian Desmond Hurst. A colorized version is available for those who fancy heresy. For everyone else the black-and-white photography (by C.M. Pennington-Richards) does right by Dickens and puts subsequent shooters in the shade. ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) ENLARGE Sometimes you just have to state the obvious. For all the times its been shown on TV re-released in theaters or repackaged on DVD Steven Spielbergs shining glowing masterpiece will never wear out its welcome. I watch it whenever it turns up and think of it whenever I drive the 405 freeway north from Westwood at night reach the crest of the hill and look down on the San Fernando Valley whose twinkling lights supposedly inspired the design of the films spaceship. Vilmos Zsigmond was director of photography and Douglas Trumbull supervised the visual effects. ""Days of Glory"" (2006) ENLARGE Foreign distributors found a forgettable English title for ""Indigenes"" an unforgettable drama about Algerian soldiers fighting in the French army in World War II. The French title translates to ""natives"" but with a strongly ironic connotation. The soldiers in question dust-poor volunteers from Algeria who had never set foot on French soil fought valiantly to liberate the motherland from Nazi rule. Yet their fellow French soldiers called them ""natives"" or worse used them as cannon fodder and saw them as subhuman scum. The spare sharp-eyed direction was by Rachid Bouchareb who worked from a splendid script by Olivier Lorelle.

"Sorry I didnt like Precious. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sorry I didnt like Precious. Sorry I didnt like Precious. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 5 2009 742 PM Precious Sorry I didnt like this movie. By Dana Stevens Gabourey Sidibe as Claireece ""Precious"" Jones in Precious Harshing on Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire (Lionsgate Films) the awkwardly titled Lee Daniels adaptation of an ""urban fiction"" best-seller makes a critic feel almost as mean-spirited as Mary the monstrously abusive mother of the films eponymous heroine. Parked in front of the TV in the grim Harlem walk-up they share Mary (played with a fearsome lack of vanity by stand-up comedian MoNique) pelts her 16-year-old daughter Claireece Precious Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) with cruel insults imperious commands and whenever possible heavy airborne objects. ""I aint done nothin"" Precious protests and the movie is at pains to prove her right For the first hour at least Precious is less a person who does things than an object to which things are done. Her absentee father seen only once in a nauseating flashback sequence rapes her on a regular basis; at 16 shes pregnant with his second child. Her daughter who has Down syndrome lives with a coldly disapproving grandmother; their visits last just long enough to fool the welfare inspector into issuing Marys next check. In addition to being obese unloved and dirt-poor Precious is also illiterate though the public school she attends is so bad that shes managed to camouflage that fact through the eighth grade. In short this girls life is so abysmal that you feel the least you can do is like the movie shes in. Its not that there isnt anything to like about Precious which at its best resembles its heroine observant large-spirited and brave. The director Lee Daniels ( Shadowboxer) puts on his hip boots and wades into grimmer territory than any recent film I can think of and his fearless leading ladies MoNique and Sidibe wade right in with him. But Daniels methodical commitment to abjection his need to shove the reality of Precious life in our faces and wave it around till we acknowledge its awfulness winds up robbing the audience (and to some extent the actors) of all agency. Daniels is not above cutting from an image of incestuous rape to a shot of greasy pork sizzling on the stove Her father treats her like meat get it? In its eagerness to drag us through the lower depths of human experience Precious leaves no space for the audience to breathe or to draw our own conclusions. For a film about empowerment and self-actualization it wields an awfully large cudgel. Advertisement Precious is expelled from school when the news of her second pregnancy comes out but the principal refers her to an alternative learning center Each One Teach One where an impossibly beautiful and patient teacher named Blu Rain (Paula Patton) leads a reading and writing workshop for dropout girls. Ms. Rain is an emissary from another world where slender caring soft-spoken women (Ms. Rain as it turns out is a lesbian) sip wine and play Scrabble and in Precious words ""talk like TV channels I dont watch."" Precious ability to read and write keeps pace with her growing belly as she slowly learns to trust Ms. Rain and her raucous foulmouthed but closeknit classmates. (All the Each One Teach One girls are deftly sketched and well-cast as is an exasperated social worker played with surprising finesse by Mariah Carey.) But when Precious baby finally arrives shes forced to depend once more on her toxic disaster of a mother. As Precious carries the fragile newborn into that awful apartment you want to rush the screen and lock her out to keep them safe and the scene that follows shamelessly exploits that protective impulse. I dont like when children are used as decoys to lure a movie audience into a trap. Seeded throughout Precious are brief dream sequences in which the stolidly joyless heroine imagines herself as a performer in a music video a movie star on the red carpet etc. Whether these are meant to be critiques of a mass culture that trades in escapist fantasy or simply pathos-ridden glimpses into Precious impoverished mental life is never clear. But like the outlandish badness of the mother character the overdetermined tawdriness of these scenes does the movie and its heroine a disservice. Daniels and his screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher are so eager to wring uplift from Precious story that theyre willing to manipulate us to get it. Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice to the kind of protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens a poor black overweight single mother from the inner city. But in offering up their heroines misery for the audiences delectation theyve created something uncomfortably close to poverty porn.

Its a seeming curse that leads to new chances and new friends including a nurse played by Lenny Kravitz. Ann Marie Fox/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Ann Marie Fox/Lionsgate Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire Director Lee DanielsGenre DramaRunning Time 110 minutes Rated R Child abuse sexual abuse With Gabourey Sidibe MoNique and Mariah Carey(Recommended) As a stand-up comic noted for raunchy one-liners MoNique probably never imagined that her name and the phrase ""Best Actress"" would find themselves in the same sentence except perhaps as a punch line. But such is the power of a blunt but undeniably effective new movie -- a melodrama with the unwieldy title Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire -- that no ones laughing at the notion as Oscar season approaches. Nor is MoNiques blistering performance as a monstrous mother the only surprise in this passionate tale. Director Lee Daniels was once a casting director and hes gone out of his way to give plenty of unlikely performers the chance to shine pop star Mariah Carey deglammed and ferocious as a bulldog of a social worker; rocker Lenny Kravitz gently amusing as a head-turning maternity-ward nurse; and most remarkably newcomer Gabourey Sidibe making her film debut as Claireece ""Precious"" Jones a withdrawn morbidly obese teenager whose very survival seems unlikely as the movie begins. i In a star turn that will take many by surprise comedian MoNique delivers a hauntingly ferocious performance as Precious abusive mother. Ann Marie Fox/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Ann Marie Fox/Lionsgate In a star turn that will take many by surprise comedian MoNique delivers a hauntingly ferocious performance as Precious abusive mother. Ann Marie Fox/Lionsgate The year is 1987 and oddly enough its the latest disaster in Precious life -- her second pregnancy -- that gives her one last chance. The principal at her Harlem school arranges for her to enroll at an ""alternative"" institution and though her mother would rather she apply for welfare Precious grasps at the offer. Illiterate bruised and abused at home (both of her pregnancies resulted from rapes at her fathers hands) this damaged teen is starting from way less than zero. When a teacher (Paula Patton) asks her to name one thing shes good at Precious comes up blank. And as director Daniels plunges into her harrowing home life where her moody mother is as likely to slam a frying pan into her head or hurl a television down stairs at her as to offer a word of kindness it seems almost preposterous that theres a spark of resilience left to be fanned. But slowly with a mulish opaque persistence she starts to come into her own. Sidibe quietly monumental as Precious is more acted upon than active for much of the picture her face so full it seems incapable of expression her movements sluggish and leaden. Once in motion though shes formidable enough that only an immovable object could oppose her. MoNiques intransigent parent is that object and remarkably Daniels and screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher have contrived to make her a monster with nuance so psychologically damaged herself that she doesnt really register what shes doing to her child. Apart from a few BET-style red-carpet moments played out in Precious fantasies -- and some correspondingly lurid flashbacks to her brutal rapes -- the film has been shot with the sort of documentarian realism common in independent features from the era in which the story takes place. And that Im guessing accounts for the way its been embraced at film festivals from Sundance to Toronto. Daniels may be indulging in stunt casting and slamming plot points home with sledgehammer subtlety but the films milieu and characters feel alarmingly real. And its story ends up packing an emotional wallop as substantial as its title character.

Her name is Precious but she is nobodys treasure. Her father has been raping her since childhood. Her mother insults and beats her (and worse). Perhaps worst of all Precious joins in their hatred quietly loathing herself opening her mouth only to stuff it with greasy food. Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire (R) Lionsgate (109 min.) Directed by Lee Daniels. With Gabourey Sidibe MoNique Paula Patton. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys rating TWO AND A HALF STARSgt; Ratings note The film contains graphic scenes of child abuse rape violence substance abuse and strong language. Now at 16 she is pregnant again. Her first baby is being raised by her grandmother. Her father is gone. And her mothers only dream for Precious is that shell start collecting her own welfare check soon. That is the small horrific world of ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire."" That it is bearable at all on-screen is thanks to its cast particularly some surprising performances by a trio of underestimated performers. Who would ever have suspected for example that Paula Patton the pretty co-star of ""Hitch"" was so naturally empathetic? Or that sitcom star MoNique could be a ferocious dramatic actress playing Precious abusive mother with a fierce clarity thats started talk of an Oscar nomination? Actually the smaller but ultimately more startling surprise here is Mariah Carey stripped of makeup and playing a Jewish social worker with an accent that could stop Fran Drescher in her tracks. If Carey ever wants to jump to the glamorous world of indie film its waiting. But those three performances are not enough to rescue this wildly overpraised film-festival favorite. The direction by Lee Daniels for example is as graceful as a sucker-punch and as subtle as a scream full of over-the-top fantasy episodes badly timed sequences ugly photography and ham-handed ""moments."" It is crude clumsy overwrought work. The lead performance by Gabourey Sidibe meanwhile is -- well problematic. The large slow-moving first-time actress is not particularly expressive. Even more cruelly the lighting (which is usually balanced for the far lighter-skinned Patton and Carey) throws Sidibes features into shadow making her even less present. But worse is the story itself. ""Precious"" is very simply a movie about surviving abuse; it has been produced and promoted by Oprah Winfrey whose own book-club tastes often value empowerment over style. The story by the one-named novelist Sapphire translates as a long womens-power rallying cry in which males are monsters females are victims and lesbians are the coolest of all. Yes of course Precious father is a devil. But does he have to be the only significant male character in the film? Do all the supportive students at Precious new school have to be girls? Does the nice social worker have to be a woman? Does the one teacher who believes in her have to be a sweetly hip homosexual? The whole thing begins to feel like ""The Color Purple"" as rewritten for a poetry slam heaping on the abuse like a horror film. (Its not enough that Precious father viciously abuses her; her mother does too. Its not enough that she has a child by her father; the child has Down syndrome. And so on and on.) Over-the-top as it is Im sure the story of Precious survival resonates with survivors of abuse (such as Winfrey and co-producer Tyler Perry who I believe are reacting more to their own stories than this one). But while abuse is real ""Precious"" is not. And only the strong artistic efforts of three of its actresses make it watchable at all.

Share Tweet Precious features plenty of off-putting images and attitudes beginning with the movies straight-out-of-Rush-Limbaughs-nightmares vision of lazy welfare queens and ending with the way the film seems to wallow in inner-city misery. It isnt enough that director Lee Daniels and screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher (working from a controversial bestseller by Sapphire) present teenager Gabourey Sidibe as morbidly obese and functionally illiterate; shes also a victim of sexual and physical abuse with a mentally retarded daughter another child on the way and a serious health crisis looming. Not even Douglas Sirk or Lars von Trier would heap so much abuse on a heroine. And yet on its own melodramatic tear-jerking terms Precious works. Daniels and Fletcher dont spare the sorrow but neither do they neglect moments of joy hope or belonging. Daniels injects some levity when Sidibe begins attending an alternative school and bonds with her fellow troubled teens and he injects style into impressionistic sequences that illustrate Sidibes interior life and how it differs from the distant (yet omnipresent) TV-approved vision of material success. Precious punishes the audience with scene after scene of squalor and hopelessness but like last years poverty-can-be-entertaining hit Slumdog Millionaire it rewards them for hanging on til the end. The story follows a predictable underdog-makes-good rhythm but hits its beats with commendable gusto. Much of the credit goes to the performances. Sidibe finesses sympathy and repugnance remarkably well and grows as an actress as her character grows as a person. Paula Patton is calm and strong as Sidibes new teacher who treats her students like people not cattle. And as Sidibes monstrous mother MoNique delivers profane terrifying tirades culminating in a monologue as painful and heartbreaking as any ever filmed. (Its an Oscar-clip kind of speech but an effective one.) If not for its stars this movie would be fairly mundane but those who believe in the power of great acting to transform a film will want to see what happens to Precious.

"Precious | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; precious ) Precious (United States 2009) November 03 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Precious (saddled with the unwieldy subtitle Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire) manages the task of being both heartbreaking and heart-warming all without resorting to the kind of manipulation so often evident in dramas about underprivileged kids trying to improve themselves. There are pitfalls inherent in this kind of story but indie director Lee Daniels sidesteps them crafting a feature that is both emotionally honest and stirring. Precious spends time in the urban trenches that are often used as a colorful backdrop for other less true films; here they are integral to the essence of the characters places where acts of supreme horror are dismissed matter-of-factly. Ultimately Precious is a story of one young womans embrace of self-worth in these circumstances but that discovery does not come without a price. When the Oscar nominees are announced in 2010 I expect Precious to be among them even though it has a harder edge than the kind of film Hollywood embraces. Its hard not to see this as being among the years ten best films regardless of what standards are being applied to that list. Likewise theres every reason to believe that newcomer Gabby Sidibe will have a place alongside Carey Mulligan on the Best Actress short list. This is the kind of freshman performance that garners attention and notice. For two hours Sidibe is Precious Jones; we live and suffer and overcome alongside the character in part because the actress has become the character. There are no awkward moments or missteps. Its 1987 and Clareece Precious Jones is a taciturn obese 16-year old girl who excels at math but is deficient in almost all other areas of education particularly reading and writing. Her home life is a living hell she must wait hand-and-foot on her quick tempered domineering mother Mary (MoNique) and is pregnant with her second child as a result of a rape by her father. When the principal of Precious school learns of her pregnancy she arranges for the girl to become a pupil at an alternative school although Mary is against further education for her ""dumb"" daughter. She believes the only future for Precious is to get on welfare. When she tries to do this she faces uncomfortable questions from her case officer Mrs. Weiss (Mariah Carey). Meanwhile Precious discovers an oasis of calm in the classroom of Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) whose genuine concern for her students encourages Precious to let down some of her defenses. But when she gives birth to a son things go from bad to worse at home especially when she gets some bad news about her father. One of the most surprising things about Precious is how uncompromisingly detestable Mary is portrayed. This isnt a cookie-cutter ""bad mother"" whose sole purpose is to provide a path to redemption and reconciliation at the end. The filmmakers dont take the easy way out either by turning her into a caricature. They provide adequate backstory to explain Marys actions but not to excuse them. She is complicit in all of the terrible things that happen to Precious throughout the course of the story. She is physically abusive in ways that are difficult to behold and on at least one occasion she tries to murder her daughter. Its also eerie to watch the mask of false sincerity she dons when a social worker visits. As good as Gabby Sidibes work is in the title role MoNique deserves equal credit in a performance that is no less accomplished. Aside from Mary the supporting characters are underwritten but thats excusable given the time constraints of a movie that makes the correct decision to focus on Precious. Further developing the likes of Mrs. Weiss Ms. Rain and the other students in Precious class would have necessitated widening the scope of the film and that might have resulted in a dilution of its essential strengths. The film is perhaps notable for featuring Mariah Carey in a simple dramatic role as Precious welfare case worker. The part is neither showy nor obvious and Carey does a solid job; she accomplishes what an effective supporting player should do. This is Lee Daniels second feature as a director following 2005s festival circuit participant Shadowboxer. Daniels film business credentials extend beyond his behind-the-camera endeavors -among other things he produced Monsters Ball. Although Precious is a low-budget production it has attracted some notable backers with both Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry signing on in executive producer roles which should accord the film more prominence than it might otherwise attain. When it debuted to a rapturous reception at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2009 Precious went by the name of Push but the title was changed to avoid confusion with the mainstream action film that opened (and subsequently disappeared) early in the year. Under its new name Precious highlighted several film festivals and was enthusiastically greeted at each one including Toronto where it won the audience award. Often festival citations dont mean much but this is an exception. Its unclear how widespread the movies final distribution will be but even if it means making an unusual effort this is worth searching out. Its a 2009 example of the kind of passionate independent filmmaking that was in vogue 15 years ago and whose richness is sadly lacking today. Precious is a reminder that sometimes all it takes to make a great film is the courageous performance of an actor as a character whose story is compelling enough to consume two hours of screen time.

The title character of Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire is a hushed damaged morbidly obese 16-year-old African-American girl from the lower depths of Harlem. Its 1987 and Claireece Precious Jones is poor and ignorant a depressed withdrawn shell of a human being with a face so inexpressive it might be a visor clamped down over her features. Gabourey Sidibe the startling newcomer who plays Precious is actually softly pretty with catlike eyes that narrow into a tensely focused glare. Precious speaks to us in voice-over (we hear her flowery notions of running off with a math teacher to suburban Westchester) and the film keeps cutting to her fantasies which are spangly TV-addict daydreams in which she whirls around in silk and feather boas adored by the world. Outside those fantasies Precious cant imagine a life. She rarely talks never smiles and hardly even frowns; she looks like it would take too much effort. Sidibe plays her with barely visible tremors of feeling that cue us to what this arrested girl is holding back. Shes an almost totally passive protagonist cut off from everyone including us. Yet theres nothing passive about the way the director Lee Daniels working from a script by Geoffrey Fletcher plunges us into the nightmare that is Precious daily hidden existence. Sometimes a movie has to take you down -- and I mean down really far -- to lift you up. Precious is that kind of movie. Daniels a former producer whose credits include Monsters Ball ushers us into the dingy Harlem flat where Precious lives and there amid the dank light and moldy yellow-flower wallpaper we see the forces that have made her who she is. There are stinging flashbacks of abuse (shes now pregnant for the second time by her drug-?addict father) and we witness the Gordian knot of her relationship with her mother Mary (MoNique) whos a scalding pit of bitterness. Their twisted and tormented co-dependence is harrowing to behold but its also as indelible as something out of Tennessee Williams. In her first dramatic role the comedian MoNique acts with such force that she burns a hole in the screen. Her Mary is raging and defeated a woman who treats Precious as a slave -- and I dont use the word lightly since part of the films power is its perception that these two are living out patterns of cruelty that go back for generations. Their agony has roots. Whats terrifying about the abuse here is how casually its accepted as a fact of life by both perpetrator and victim. Mary hates her daughter because she thinks that Precious has ""stolen"" her man. Yet she also exploits her as a welfare ticket. How to escape this hell? One night the two get a visit from a school administrator who wants to enroll Precious in a special program for problem students. Quietly almost instinctively Precious signs up. The program becomes her pathway out of the madness and into a real life. And if that sounds like a facile feel-good scenario the way that Daniels stages it sticking to the merciless outline of Sapphires novel its more like a slow walk of redemption marked by tiny roadside bombs that keep going off. Precious comes to the attention of a welfare counselor played by Mariah Carey with an authentically deglammed compassion and once shes in the class she starts to wake up. These episodes arent the usual inspirational claptrap; theyre about troubled girls striving and often failing to turn themselves around. The more Precious tries to get away from her mother the more shes pulled back and the final scene of revelation between them will leave you tearful shaken dazed with pity and terror. Precious captures how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead and Daniels shows unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives. Precious is a film that makes you think ""There but for the grace of God go I."" Its a potent and moving experience because by the end you feel youve witnessed nothing less than the birth of a soul.

Precious--as she prefers to be called--is the central figure in the poet Sapphires bestselling 1996 novel Push an homage of sorts to The Color Purple (which it directly references and also mirrors in its diaristic style) set in the pre-gentrification Harlem of the mid-1980s. And its a testament to Sapphires affecting prose (written in Preciouss own words and dialect) that her protagonist emerges as something more than a mere statistic or representative--that we understand how Preciouss story is for all its commonalities with other abused black women uniquely her own.Director Lee Danielss film adaptation (which has been retitled Precious since its Sundance premiere and also acquired two high-profile ""presenters"" in Tyler Perry and Oprah) is a somewhat blunter but nevertheless effective object. Working from screenwriter Geoffrey Fletchers faithful adaptation Daniels cultivates an aesthetic that is often more grotesque than artful sometimes artfully grotesque (like a Courbet painting) and rarely delivered with less than a sledgehammer thwack. Bleak though it was on the page the apartment shared by Precious (newcomer Gabourey Sidibe) and her layabout welfare mother Mary (MoNique) here appears like a Lenox Avenue Grey Gardens with a television perpetually tuned to The 100000 Pyramid and curtains that dont seem to have parted since whatever decade Mary last left the premises. When Daniels flashes back to Preciouss horrifying rapes the wide-angle close-ups of her fathers heaving body and of fried chicken sizzling on the stove feel like outtakes from one of Rudy Ray Moores outre blaxploitation farces (or from Danielss own risible little-seen debut feature Shadowboxer featuring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as oedipal hired assassins). And when Precious enrolls at the alternative school where a teacher improbably named Blu Rain (Paula Patton) inspires her to stand and deliver the classrooms are wreathed in ethereal light.Hothouse melodrama one moment kitchen-sink (and frying-pan-to-the-head) realism the next with eruptions of incongruous slapstick throughout this may be Danielss stab at finding a cinematic analog for the novels inventive naif-art language--a film style like Preciouss writing style seemingly being made up as it goes along. Yet even when the movie is at its most schizoid Precious still packs a wallop. What Daniels lacks as a craftsman he makes up for in his willingness to put the lives of abused and defeated black women on the screen with brute-force candor and a lack of sentimentality. Where Push the novel echoed The Color Purple the novel Precious the movie operates as something of a corrective to Steven Spielbergs 1985 film with its narrative sanitizing and artery-clogging Quincy Jones score. Its own inspirational touches notwithstanding (not for nothing did it cop the audience awards at Sundance and Toronto earlier this year) Precious is less about overcoming adversity than about survival--a battle the movie does not begin to pretend can be won in two hours of screen time. No slumdog millionaires here Danielss movie puts us through hell--Preciouss hell--and leaves us somewhere like limbo.A former casting director Daniels shows undeniable savoir faire with his actors a mix of musicians and comedians effectively cast against type from a dark-haired deglamorized Mariah Carey as a tough-love social worker to a subtle Lenny Kravitz as an attentive male nurse. The picture belongs however to the gale-force MoNique who transforms an ostensibly one-note monster mom into a complex portrait of a psychologically damaged woman (no matter that Daniels seems to have edited her most showstopping scene in a blender) and to the magnanimous Sidibe who carries the alternately exhausting and exhilarating narrative on her formidable shoulders. For most of the movie her stoically beautiful face stays wrought tight in a mask of sadness and self-loathing. When she relaxes those muscles ever so slightly--one of the movies few subtle touches--it is like a weight of centuries has been lifted.

By Anthony Lane Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges and George Clooney in Grant Heslovs movie.   Credit Illustration by Pablo Lobato Can the human mind be used as a weapon of war? It would be cheaper than a pilotless drone for one thing though not necessarily smarter. Those who wish to pursue this exciting possibility are advised to see ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" which is based on a book by the British journalist Jon Ronson. What Ronson discovered in his researches was a section of the United States military that was solely and specifically tasked with mental combat. ""More of this is true than you would believe"" an opening title declares. What a tease. Our Ronson-like protagonist is an American reporter named Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor). He works in Ann Arbor but craves a wider beat; the craving takes him to Iraq or at any rate to a Kuwaiti hotel. There he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney) who claims to be one of the Jedi Warriors men who stared at goats until they--the goats that is not the men--fell down dead. (""Whats a Jedi warrior?"" Wilton asks. So thats why McGregor was hired for the sake of an in-joke.) Staring was just one of the indispensable skills that were drilled into Cassidy and his comrades years before by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) who vowed ""We must become the first superpower to develop super powers."" Django was a ponytailed visionary--if thats not a tautology--who following an epiphany in Vietnam founded the New Earth Army in order to establish whether love and peace can win wars. The answer is ""They cant"" but that didnt stop his recruits from trying to run through walls or the government from sponsoring the program. Most of these training sessions are viewed in flashback. The films director Grant Heslov flips constantly between the Django regime and the recent situation in Iraq as Cassidy--who says he has been reactivated--crosses the border with Wilton in tow on a mission too secret to be revealed. If Heslov and his screenwriter Peter Straughan prefer to linger on the early days of the unit its because that is where the action is or was. Hence the quick perfect scene in which an ambitious psychic named Hooper (Kevin Spacey) congratulates the happy couple at a wedding reception and adds ""Sorry it doesnt work out between you two."" At moments like this the movie feels rich in satisfactions. To watch actors as nimble as Bridges Clooney and Spacey clashing wits as if they were lightsabers is precisely the kind of fun--grownup fun delivered by men not kids and lit not by special effects but by a serious love of the joust--that I demand from Hollywood and for the most part no longer get. Each man vies to be the most deadpan determined to present his character a solemn clairvoyant fruitcake as nuttier than the rest. Clooney is probably the winner here even turning to McGregor and wielding the famous ""sparkly eyes"" technique as taught to super-spies without a smirk. The most handsome and capable star in the world and he doesnt mind coming across as a total dork. Its not fair. Its also not fair that the movie lets him down. Clooney gives it everything but what does he get in return? A void where the story is meant to be. For a while everything ambles along like a mashup of ""Three Kings"" the 1999 Clooney film about the first Gulf War and the Three Stooges with Heslov dishing out roof tumbles car smashes and cheek slaps. Much of this is neatly framed--an eye poke for some reason is funnier in long shot--and you sit there for an hour in good humor waiting for the narrative to stop noodling around and get going only to realize to your consternation that its winding down. In truth there just isnt enough motion here to sustain a motion picture. The material is a gift Considering the mileage that Robin Williams got out of ""military intelligence"" for his radio riffs in ""Good Morning Vietnam"" you can imagine the glee with which he would have feasted on the news of psychic soldiering. As for Joseph Heller its only the thought that some targets are just too pitifully easy that might have restrained his hand. In both cases however the Jedis would surely have supplied no more than a telling subplot or a skit. After all its not as if they ever achieved anything. Late in the day efforts are made to knock up a makeshift finale. In a covert facility in the desert Wilton and Cassidy the logic of whose actions is roughly half of that allotted to Hope and Crosby in ""Road to Morocco"" stumble upon Django and other figures from the past. We get a communal acid trip--always a clear sign of a movie with nowhere to go--followed by pounding volleys of rock music as a herd of goats which have been shot at rather than merely stared at are set free together with a cluster of orange-suited enemy prisoners who have been tortured. This sideways glance at a deeply uncomical and still potent issue is one hell of a misstep on Heslovs part. Having urged us to take nothing seriously throughout how can he expect us to switch for a couple of minutes to a thoughtful and disapproving frown? What is this ""Road to Guantanamo""? Safely back in America Wilton pledges to ""tell everybody what happened."" But thats the problem Bob. Nothing did. Please make sure when you buy a ticket for ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire"" to pronounce the title in full. I know you will. There was a plan to call it ""Push"" until another movie got there first. But why not call the new one ""Precious"" and leave it at that? After all Deborah Kerr didnt star in ""The Innocents Based on the Novella The Turn of the Screw by Henry James"" and Dustin Hoffman didnt star in ""Rain Man Based on the Overwhelming Desire to Win an Academy Award by Dustin Hoffman"" so why the change in rubric? The heroine is Clareece Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) a Harlem teen-ager better known as Precious. She is grimly overweight her face so filled out that the play of normal expression seems restricted; yet Sidibe does wonders with that sad limitation and we learn to spot the flare of anger in her eyes. She has much to be angry about aged sixteen she already has one child who has Down syndrome and is carrying another. The father is her own father who later turns out to be H.I.V. positive. We are forced to watch as she is violated in livid closeup complete with squeaking bedsprings a belt being unbuckled above a sweating belly and--lest the seething aggression of the rape escape us--a shot of eggs sizzling in grease. If the subject were not so grave you would be tempted to laugh at this desperate overkill of detail. Does the director Lee Daniels not realize how such industrial-strength images tend to weaken rather than fortify the moral case? Expelled for being pregnant Precious seeks alternative schooling at Each One Teach One a local program for those undesired elsewhere. Her classmates especially Jo Ann (Xosha Roquemore) whose favorite color is ""fluorescent beige"" and Rhonda (Chyna Layne) with her fabulously broad Jamaican accent are the most naturally uplifting people in the film--far more so than their teacher Blu Rain (Paula Patton) whose powers of uplift feel like make-believe. She is a vision of tolerant gentleness who wears a new set of soft fabrics every day and plays Scrabble in the evening with her equally lovely lesbian partner. ""They talk like TV stations I dont watch"" Precious says but that tart line is not borne out by the film which drinks in Ms. Rain without demur. The same goes for the fantasy sequences--hugely ill-advised dream clips showing a richly clad Precious at a movie premiere or slow-dancing with a hunk. One of them even finds a slender white girl gazing back at her from the bedroom mirror. What we have here is a fouled-up fairy tale of oppression and empowerment and its hard not to be ensnared by its mixture of rank maleficence and easy reverie. The gap between being genuinely stirred and having your arm twisted however is narrower than we care to admit. What rescues ""Precious"" is the performance of MoNique as Mary the heroines Medusa-like mother. Given her range of leisure interests--smoking cursing channel surfing baby tossing munching pigs feet and throwing televisions down the stairs--there is no reason that the character should be more than a vicious cartoon. But MoNique gives tremendous life to this dead soul makes you wonder where her own misery sprouted from and closes the proceedings with a monologue of selfishness so storm-driven that for a second despite ourselves we are almost swept away. Sitting opposite during this tempest is a social worker Mrs. Weiss (Mariah Carey). Hold on a stern song-free compassionate piece of acting from Mariah Carey? That sounds like one of Preciouss fantasies but its for real.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review When Push Comes to Shove The violent and shocking Precious should be more moving than it is. _ By David Edelstein Published Nov 2 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Lionsgate) There are worst-case scenarios and then there is Precious whos in a hellish league of her own. The heroine and narrator of the novel Push by Sapphire (born Ramona Lofton) now a much-hyped film called Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire is the embodiment of everythingI mean everythingAmerican society values least and victimizes most. Shes a poor illiterate morbidly obese dark-skinned African-American girl. She was raped by her father from the age of 3 pregnant with his child at 12 (the baby which she names Mongo has severe Down syndrome) and then pregnant by him again at 16 when the novel begins. Shes also sexually molested by her jealous welfare-cheating gross and sedentary mother although the genital fingering might seem preferable to the verbal and physical abuse. The book gives you quite a bludgeoning. I started to pull back from it in a flashback when the 12-year-old girl is in labor on the kitchen floor and her mother is kicking her in the face. See Also  Edelsteins Response to Commenters  Gabby Sidibes Astonishing Debut Sapphire goes on to chart Preciouss journey from darkness to light her transfer to an alternative school and acceptance into a warm matriarchal community where shes encouraged to give voice to her experiences in poetry and prose. A former teacher Sapphire wants to show young women that if the damaged emotionally locked-up Precious can develop a sense of self-worth and autonomy anyone can. But Push written in Preciouss distinctive patois (I still dont say nuffin. This hoe is keeping me from maff class. I like maff class) is so schematic so single-minded in its depiction of predatory evil and empowering good that you may think its title is not an exhortation to drive through pain but a description of the authors technique. I dwell on the novel because the movie leads with it (that subtitle) and because it faithfully even reverently sticks to Sapphires outline. But the director Lee Daniels working from a screenplay by Geoffrey Fletcher has a good sense of when to push and when to lie back. His rhythms are punchyabrasive without being assaultive. And he has such a striking actress in Gabourey Sidibe who plays Precious that he doesnt need to force her alienationor ours. Im not judging girls who look like Sidibe in life but her image onscreen is jarring to the point of being transgressive its only equivalent to be seen in John Waterss pointedly outrageous carnivals. Her head is a balloon on the body of a zeppelin her cheeks so inflated they squash her eyes into slits. Her expression is either surly or unreadable. Even with her voice-over narration youre meant to stare at her ebony face and see nothing. The movie is saying that shes not an object but the way that Sidibe is directed she becomes one. Its only in a couple of heavy-handed fantasy sequences (she emerges from a theater in a bright-red gown to popping flashbulbs) that her eyes are windows to the soul. Daniels does everything to hold the melodrama at bay but theres only so much he can do. The comedian MoNique gives a vivid and surprisingly varied performance as Preciouss mother Mary (ironic-name alert) I have no doubt she found psychological justifications for Marys sadism for the displacement onto Precious of her fury at a man who she thinks preferred her daughter to her. But the woman who drops a TV onto Precious as she hurries down the stairs with her infant is a sociopath too singularly garish to be universal. As Preciouss teacher Ms. Rain Paula Patton is at the other extreme. A light-skinned beauty with fine features she has a network-TV wholesomeness Even her lesbianism has the equivalent of a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approvala poster on her wall of For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf. The most offbeat touch is a social worker played by Mariah Carey. Shes a tad too goody-goody but her toasty caressing voice is a gift beside Sidibes mush-mouthed monosyllables. Daniels does well with the girls in Preciouss class who have a mordant barbed rapport. Theyre almost as defended as she is so when they bond with her its not sticky You can feel their relief in being able to get out of their own heads and be kind. Thats when the film is genuinely moving without being manipulative. But it somehow skips over the part where Precious actually learns. When she tells us in voice-over that she won a literacy prize you may think you missed something. Precious jumps from signpost to signpost. Set in 1987 it features obligatory images on TV of Reagan and Ollie Northbut also for hopes sake photos of Oprah Winfrey (thinner than she was at the time) who signed onto the film as co-executive-producer after it was made. The elements of Precious are powerful and shocking but the movie is programmed. It is its own study guide. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The lower-case ""tiff"" the color of a pumpkin blares from posters and billboards throughout the city as a symbol of festival director Piers Handlings determination to simplify everything including the logo in a movie orgy that has clearly outgrown itself. Last year the sheer bloat of this annual circus inspired accusations of ""elitism"" and complaints that a beloved event started by three movie buffs in 1975 was ""no longer the peoples film festival."" This year in the midst of a hobbling global recession the goal is to ""return the festival to the people"" as 312 feature films flow through every projector in the city from 9 a.m. screenings for priority press to midnight-madness horror flicks featuring the latest assortment of infectious viruses rampaging zombies and flesh-eating ghouls for the unwashed masses toting sandwich bags and styrofoam cups from Starbucks. (The projectionists sleep from 2 a.m. to dawn.) I dont know about a return to simpler days but there is certainly something here for every taste. You can see documentaries about Hugh Hefner and Glenn Gould; endless tracts on the war in Iraq; Michael Moores latest assault on capitalism (blame it all on Bushs bank bailouts); Drew Barrymores making her directorial debut with Whip It starring Ellen Page on roller skates; a vampire musical called Suck; Jewish liturgy from the Coen brothers; and another loathsome barf job by Danish wacko Lars von Trier called Antichrist in which pickle-faced Charlotte Gainsbourg who always looks embalmed prunes away her genitalia with garden shears. Naturally it will show up shortly in the New York Film Festival the official depository for movies nobody wants to see where torturing the audience has become an acknowledged priority. Despite the volume of product there is evidence wherever you turn that the fat has been trimmed. Recession-cautious buyers are stoic and roughly 100 of the films on display have arrived without any distributors at all. Unlike Cannes which has an actual film market resembling a tag sale Torontos deals are more informal with the buying and selling done on cell phones and in hotel lobbies. Hollywood studios are scaling back on the swag. There are fewer exclusive dinners midnight cocktail soirees corporate sponsors red-carpet premieres limousine rentals and hairdresser appointments. Nobody seems to care much about shelling out money even for bragging rights. But George Christys coveted annual lunch at the Four Seasons went on as planned; Matt Damon hosted another charity benefit for underprivileged kids; and Joan Baez gave a free concert in the middle of the street. This year the lavish party circuit is taking a back seat to the movies and glam venues like the Rosewater Supper Club and Ultra have a lot of blank pages in their reservation books. Never mind. Swag or no swag the boldface names are here anyway. Spotted in full gridlock on the red-carpet runway Demi Moore Ann-Margret Norman Jewison Mariah Carey Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges Keanu Reeves Viggo Mortensen one-name-is-all-you-need Oprah assorted Colins (Farrell and Firth) Jennifers (Connelly and Garner but not Aniston) and Michaels (Caine Douglas Moore and J. Fox). Not to mention Bill Murray Patricia Clarkson Christopher Plummer Penelope Cruz Clive Owen Edward Norton Chris Rock Nicolas Cage Robin Wright Penn and others too famous to mention. They only stay long enough to suffer through the idiotic press conferences pose and then head for the airport. Some of them dont even have movies to plug. Theyre just here for the photo ops. George Clooney is everywhere with his hand in a bandage--a good excuse for not signing autographs. Jane Fonda is not here but sent some controversy in her place. When she heard about this years sidebar event honoring Israeli films and the city of Tel Aviv she signed a protest letter attacking the Israelis and defending Palestine which elicited an enraged response from Jon Voight her co-star in Coming Home who accused a deluded Jane of once again backing all the wrong people. Result A series that stood every chance of being ignored suddenly had a new focus of world interest. Too bad Jane and cohorts like Harry Belafonte and Wallace Shawn didnt know one of the films they boycotted was a collaboration between Israeli and Pakistani co-directors. I skipped Triage an Irish war drama with Colin Farrell as a wounded front-lines freelance photographer in Kurdistan (he lost 25 pounds for the role by living on black coffee cigarettes and two cans of tuna per day) and opted for a live auction where one of the prizes was tea with Diane Lane to ""talk Hollywood world issues and life."" Dont ask. WOLFING DOWN CLUB sandwiches and Yoo-hoos you finally try to see some movies. After years of bad advice from festival brochures and eager press agents experience (and failing eyesight) have taught me to cross off some contenders early just from the synopses like the one that ""tells the story of 13-year-old Gunther growing up in the 1980s in a household of drunks gamblers and womanizers in small-town Belgium."" Or how about ""an alcoholic actress trying to put her life together"" and ""a young mother struggling to shake a drug habit""? Sometimes the titles alone will do it (Bitch Slap Women Without Men The Men Who Stare at Goats). In all the clutter I have still managed to see some amazing films. If Toronto sets the tone for the forthcoming awards season you can plan ahead for a few riveting performances and welcome surprises. You also better plan to dress up for depression. Viggo Mortensen gives the performance of his career in the faithfully rendered film adaptation of Cormac McCarthys heartbreaking apocalyptic novel The Road. After an unspecified global catastrophe wipes out most of the world including his wife (Charlize Theron) a desperate father (a gaunt Viggo) in an attempt to stay alive takes his son on a long and dangerous journey to the sea across a burned-out America encountering cannibalism rape and other bleak nightmares amid the last remnants of human life (Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce among them). Artistically rendered by director John Hillcoat sensitively adapted by Joe Penhall hauntingly shot in many of the post-Katrina landscapes in southern Louisiana and wonderfully acted (especially by Viggo whose face has been described as an El Greco etching) The Road is a tremendous achievement. George Clooney is unveiling two alleged ""comedies"" simultaneously--one good the other an insufferable disaster. In Jason (Juno) Reitmans smart cynical and witty Up in the Air the suave Hollywood film personality his fans have erroneously labeled ""the new Cary Grant"" plays a cool emotionally detached and swellegantly groomed businessman whose job is to fly around America downsizing companies and firing people. Hes a termination specialist whose only goal in life is to rack up 10 million frequent flyer miles. But fate intervenes when he meets a tough cookie played by the fantastic Vera Farmiga and all bets are off when he breaks his own rules falls in love against his better judgment and finds his heart. The payoff (a basically venal character who deceptively appears to have everything already reevaluates his career priorities when he learns how much hes been missing) is not as sappy as it sounds and the ending is a kick in the shins. Up in the Air often looks like an American Airlines commercial and I wouldnt call it a feel-good movie per se but theres a certain satisfaction watching two snappy beautiful people at the top of their form. Mr. Clooney has never looked better acted with more confidence or oozed more charm but hes no Cary Grant.

An urban nightmare with a surfeit of soul ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire"" is like a diamond -- clear bright but oh so hard. To simply call it harrowing or unsparing doesnt quite cut it; ""Precious"" is also courageous and uncompromising a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation despair and hope. Everyone involved deserves credit for creating a movie so dangerous problematic and ultimately elevating. Marketing will be a problem because the shorthand description is so unpalatable. But this is for all its scorched-earth emotion a film to be loved. Adapted by Damien Paul from the work by one-time Harlem teacher and poet Sapphire the pic tells the story of Claireece ""Precious"" Jones (newcomer Gabourey ""Gabby"" Sidibe) a character who might have sprung from the collective brain of Charles Dickens Toni Morrison and whoever carved the heads on Easter Island. With a jutting jaw and barely visible eyes Claireeces face is a monument to the racial crimes of the past 400 years (that this miserable child of 16 can look in the mirror and fantasize seeing a blonde white girl is pungent shorthand for a raft of evils). Mute and mountainous a stolid outsider who can barely read Claireece is pregnant -- again -- by her father and on the verge of being kicked out of school. Shes also cruelly oppressed by her mother Mary (MoNique) whose daily routine consists of watching daytime TV smoking cigarettes and treating her daughter like a slave (any historical parallels are not an accident). The situation is so dire that you almost have to laugh -- the way you might laugh nervously during the darkest moments of a horror movie. ""Precious"" is a horror movie of course and Mary is a monster whose one glimmer of humanity -- which MoNique who is utterly brilliant reveals in a tour de force soliloquy at the finale -- only makes her more horrible. Second-time helmer Daniels (""Shadowboxer"") demonstrates a remarkable balletic ability to juggle emotional extremes. Claireece has her fantasies and their visualizations -- of the girl as satin-clad pop star movie star or supermodel -- work as relief valves. Theyre never funny but they do humanize a character who has been reduced by those who are supposed to love her to a piece of meat and who presents herself to the world as a very different far less attractive creature than the Claireece we hear in voiceover. Daniels never allows the film however gothic and nightmarish to lose its footing in the real world and that world includes a certain amount of hope Despite her mothers hostility Claireece enrolls in an alternative school where a teacher named Blu Rain (Paula Patton) prepares young women for their GEDs. Patton is terrific beautiful but carrying the weight of the world in her eyes. And Claireeces classmates with their street-smart banter give the film some needed levity. Among the many delightful surprises in the film is Mariah Carey who is pitch-perfect as a welfare counselor and serves as this demi-tragedys Greek chorus. Its possible that many viewers wont recognize her until the final credits but like so many things about ""Precious"" the performance is disarming. Production values are tops.
