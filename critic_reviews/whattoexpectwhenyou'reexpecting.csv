Comments click to enlarge What to Expect When Youre Expecting Video Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2012 Woody Allen once turned a self-help book into a killer comedy--Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex . . . but Were Afraid to Ask--so technically the genre isnt beneath contempt. But this movie is. Adapted from the perennial best seller by Heidi Murkoff it intertwines four stale story lines about expectant mothers (Elizabeth Banks Cameron Diaz Anna Kendrick Jennifer Lopez) as it trudges toward the preordained warm glow of an ending. The cast includes Chris Rock Dennis Quaid and some of the more affordable faces from Bridesmaids (Ben Falcone Rebel Wilson Wendi McLendon-Covey) though the only real pleasure is Banks a skilled comic player (Role Models The 40-Year-Old Virgin) who puts the other three women to shame. Kirk Jones (Nanny McPhee) directed a script by Shauna Cross (Whip It) and Heather Hach (Freaky Friday). By J.R.

Take our movie trivia quiz Video What to Expect When Youre Expecting trailer Monitor Movie Guide Babies are cute and expectant parents often arent. That kind of sums up ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" derived (pretty much in title only) from the bestselling parenthood manual. As movies-from-manuals go I much prefer Woody Allens ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex.""Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez provide the star power but whats missing is script power - the movie is a series of cliched situations about impending pregnancy and how emotionally far apart men and women are when it comes to parenthood. The only subplot with any traction is the one between Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford playing rival food- truck chefs. They belong on The Food Network.

"What to Expect as tiring as pregnancy |       NJ.com comments What to Expect as tiring as pregnancy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 18 2012 at 820 AM View/Post Comments Melissa MoseleySkyler (Brooklyn Decker) and Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) in ""What To Expect When Youre Expecting."" Pregnancy can be a tedious process full of doubt and discomfort its brief moments of joy bracketed by long periods when it seems as if the whole things never ever going to end. So is this movie. Yes ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" is -- like ""Think Like a Man"" like ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" -- another Hollywood romantic comedy based on the title of a self-help book. And at least for once its not based on a self-help book where a man tells women how theyre getting everything wrong. In fact the original ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" -- in case youre not one of the millions of parents who ever had it parked on your nightstand -- was calming upbeat even joyful. Not so this picture. Instead its a fairly standard overstuffed rom-com with a bunch of disparate couples going through their own versions of the nine-month miracle. And as in most films like this some of the stories -- and stars -- come off far better than others. Cameron Diaz is terrific for example as a TV fitness guru whos gotten pregnant unexpectedly -- and is too used to being the Alpha dog to realize she cant control everything thats about to happen. Elizabeth Banks meanwhile goes for even broader comedy -- and will probably garner the most appreciative laughs -- as a woman whos always idealized the process and gets a rude awakening. Theyre both fine and work very hard. But the development of their stories is still only so-so. (Diaz in particular doesnt have a lot to work with besides her incredibly trim figure.) And theyre the standouts in the picture. Far less successful is Jennifer Lopez trying for tears as a woman hoping to conceive (but never quite selling that poignancy thanks to her forever petulant baby-girl voice). And plucky Anna Kendrick wasted in a story about a less-planned pregnancy. As for the fathers ... well theyre little more than clueless sperm donors. Although Dennis Quaid gets a few smiles as a sugar-daddy-in-his-dotage a long subplot about a male support group is literally mirthless -- even with Chris Rock working his hardest. Perhaps once all these actors were hired there wasnt any money left for decent filmmakers. Perhaps as in many star-driven properties signing up malleable filmmakers whod simply ensure everyone got nice closeups and yummy catering was always the point. But the result is a tired flat-looking film. Director Kirk Jones and screenwriters Shauna Cross and Heather Hach consistently fall back on corny music and slow-motion to try to get laughs. Very little of this movie feels risky or even frisky. In fact this was the third rom-com I saw in a single week featuring a romantic hero who ran a gourmet food truck. I dont know what that means exactly -- except perhaps that Hollywoods screenwriters are spending way too much time hanging out at gourmet food trucks. And not nearly enough time coming up with new ideas. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and strong language. What To Expect When Youre Expecting (PG-13) Lionsgate (110 min.) Directed by Kirk Jones. With Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez Elizabeth Banks. Now playing in New Jersey.

When I say that this months ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" -- similarly inspired by a self-help book -- isnt all that bad I mean that it doesnt share the slapdash characteristics of Garry Marshalls ""Valentines Day"" and ""New Years Eve."" As an ensemble comedy though it remains patently contrived to deliver the safer side of pregnancy-related humor over the course of five tidily intersecting plot lines. Theres maternity store owner Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) whose efforts to conceive with husband Gary (Ben Falcone) finally bear fruit only for Wendy to endure all the worst symptoms of pregnancy. Gary feels one-upped by his competitive father Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) as he expects twins with trophy wife Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) whose prenatal ease infuriates Wendy to no end. There are competitive food truck owners Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford) contending with the result of a one-night stand reality show stars Jules (Cameron Diaz) and Evan (Matthew Morrison) dealing with a similarly unexpected pregnancy in the public spotlight and a barren couple -- photographer Holly (Jennifer Lopez) and ad man Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) -- who opt to adopt. The scenarios concocted by screenwriters Shauna Cross (""Whip It"") and Heather Hach (2003s ""Freaky Friday"" remake) run the gamut from traditional procreation to accidental conception adoption and emergency C-sections. A miscarriage only plagues one storyline while the matter of abortion is unsurprisingly kept off the table. Couples fight over baby names and whether or not to circumcise mothers demand an epidural that they initially refused (arent we past that gag yet?) while fathers cling to their dignity at weekend park meet-ups where worn-out men like Thomas Lennon and Chris Rock -- as apparently the only black man in Atlanta -- can gripe about their taxing lifestyle before doubling back on those sentiments in the third act. One weekend its ""parenthood is where happiness comes to die""; the next its ""theres nothing like becoming a parent."" Thats all to be expected (pardon the pun) yet the ensemble commits to some measure of sincerity all around as director Kirk Jones (""Everybodys Fine"") juggles the threads well enough to keep the tonal shifts between broad golf-cart-in-the-pool comedy and somber moments of money woes from resembling the characters own mood swings. However the occasional live-wire performance from supporting actresses like Rebel Wilson (as Wendys assistant) and Megan Mullally (as a randy dance-competition extension of herself) cant detract from the sitcom-shallow observations about the compromises it takes to make adult relationships work. And before we know it theres a veritable flood of breaking water that sees every character in the same hospital on the same night even those who no longer have a baby of their own to welcome into the world. Lets face it though happy endings dont deliver themselves and for anyone drawn in by all those famous faces on the poster ""Expecting"" should deliver exactly what theyve come to expect over these past few years.

"What to Expect When Youre Expecting (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review What to Expect When Youre Expecting (PG-13) The latest film adaptation of a non-fiction bestseller would have made a better sitcom. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald5/17/2012 Editor rating 2 Remember when advice books stayed on the shelves where they belonged? Me neither. The latest in what seems to be a trend to bring them to the screen What to Expect When Youre Expecting used to be a popular guide for expectant mothers. Now instead of explaining the month-by-month changes in fetal development and discussing the benefits of breastfeeding its an excuse to throw together a bunch of attractive actors tie their shallowly defined characters to a single concept -- and with any luck watch the money roll in. The plan worked for Think Like a Man which ruled the box office until The Avengers assembled so What to Expect When Youre Expecting stands a chance of luring some filmgoers presumably female ones. Trouble is the movie isnt as funny as Think Like a Man which benefited by prowling around the topics of sex and romance; it never had to get too serious. It also had a breakout performance from Kevin Hart as a screaming lunatic on the verge of divorce. What to Expect has no standout character whos consistently funny and it must operate within the confines of a ""kids are the most important thing in our lives"" mentality which is more tiresome ground comedically speaking. On the bright side it gets to show cute babies at the end. The film follows the adventures-in-expecting of several couples all but one of them in Atlanta a Dancing With the Stars-type performer (Matthew Morrison) and his partner/girlfriend; a celebrity weight loss guru (Cameron Diaz); a couple (Jennifer Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro) who have decided to adopt a child because they cant conceive; two young food truck chefs (Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford) who engage in an unprotected interlude atop a car and end up in trouble; and a baby expert (Elizabeth Banks) who learns that being with child isnt quite as rosy a picture as the literature promised. To make matters worse her husband (Ben Falcone of Bridesmaids) finds himself in competition with his race car driver dad (Dennis Quaid) whose glowing young wife (Brooklyn Decker) is also pregnant -- with twins. Also floating around on the edges are a gang of dads who meet in the park every week a sort of Greek chorus reminding the audience of all the hilarity of poor parenting choices like picking up the wrong baby from daycare. This conceit could easily been annoying but the group thanks mainly to Chris Rock manages to be amusing though not enough to make you overlook the lame vomit and ""get me an epidural"" jokes. The cast is game but What to Expect When Youre Expecting plays out more like a long sitcom than a feature film. Its Hes Just Not That Into You with arguments about circumcision -- and it wont make you long for the release of Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus now inexplicably in production. Cast Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez Matthew Morrison Rodrigo Santoro Elizabeth Banks Chace Crawford Anna Kendrick Ben Falcone Dennis Quaid Brooklyn Decker Chris Rock. Director Kirk Jones. Screenwriters Shauna Cross Heather Hach. Based on the books by Heidi Murkoff. Producers Mike Medavoy Arnold Messer David Thwaites. A Lionsgate Films release. Running time 110 minutes.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 18 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 18 2012 934AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The popular self-help book adaptation has emerged as a viable romcom subgenre. But while the books ""inspiring"" this years fare are aimed mainly at women the movies are all about the boys. Last month Think Like a Man an ensemble comedy inspired by Steve Harveys relationship bestseller and revolving around basketball-playing buddies spent two weeks at No. 1 before The Avengers arrived. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" starring Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez Elizabeth Banks and many more Movies What to Expect When Youre Expecting The official trailer What to Expect When Youre Expecting inspired by Heidi Murkoffs multimillion-selling bible for expectant parents lacks the superpower to knock The Avengers from the top spot. But the slick Atlanta-set star-studded movie will certainly compete with Think Like a Man for the short-attention-span crowd - its a sitcom-y ensemble film (complete with product placement) that feels like youre flipping around the TV dial. From the advance promo you might assume What to Expect is a Chris Rock comedy. He may play a minor one-note character but when Rock and his ""Dudes Group"" finally strut on screen - wrapped in baby carriers and pushing strollers in slow motion like an elite squad on a mission - the partys started. They are intended to function as a comic Greek chorus and their collective wisdom becomes the movies unexpected emotional centre. You start wishing the Dudes Group had more screen time or even its own movie. Maybe next year. Brit Kirk Jones ( Waking Ned Devine Nanny McPhee) competently directs the traffic but the tone is all over the map. The five expectant couples are given almost equal weight so watching is more about keeping track than caring about what happens. And without wiggle room to build up comic situations the comedy is mostly contrived slapstick. Screenwriters Shauna Cross (now adapting the ballyhooed Go the Fck to Sleep) and Heather Hach (Disneys Freaky Friday remake) give a showbiz sheen to pat representative characters. In the opening scene Jules (Cameron Diaz) a 40-ish fitness guru and host of a weight-loss reality show throws up into a trophy cup on national TV after winning Celebrity Dance Factor with partner Evan (Matthew Morrison). Its the most memorable scene in their story. Oh and theres their ongoing debate about circumcision- one of several topics woven into the film to reflect the books content. Jennifer Lopez does not convince as a struggling photographer hoping the bohemian household she keeps with husband Alex (Brazilian heartthrob Rodrigo Santoro) will be approved by the adoption agency. When they discover a child is ready for pickup in Ethiopia in a few months time Alex hangs out with Rocks Dudes Group to warm his cold feet. Elizabeth Banks is a standout as Wendy the unshakeably cheery owner of a breastfeeding boutique whose pregnancy does not achieve quite the ""glow"" she expected. Her unhinged rant about her third-trimester discomfort in front of a surprised audience of pregnant moms is funny and rings true. Wendys milquetoast husband Gary (Ben Falcone) is the movies designated humiliation target. His father (Dennis Quaid) a back-slapping super-competitive former NASCAR champ trumps his sons news by announcing that he and his younger thinner blonder trophy wife (Brooklyn Decker) are also expecting. Later on a stressed-out Gary a former weight-loss-show contestant is reprimanded by Jules on camera in front of a food truck. Poor guy. Which brings us to Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford as competing twentysomething foodtruck chefs who trade flirtatious jabs. The dreamy late-night vibe of their story is enchanting and the performances are appealing but they seem to belong to a different movie. With instant brand recognition a winning cast familiar TV elements and an easy-to-follow nine-month structure What to Expect When Youre Expecting is engineered to deliver something for everyone. Just dont expect a bundle of joy.

Photo Cameron Diaz (center) stars as a fitness-show host who gets pregnant and bullies her baby daddy in ""What To Expect . . ."" The best seller ""What To Expect When Youre Expecting"" has been around for 28 years making the book much newer than most of the jokes in this all-star movie. The film is dully shot and so predictably plotted you could tick off the items like youre packing a bag for the delivery room. Mood swings? Check. Waddling? Check. Begging for an epidural? You get the idea. That said while it certainly isnt good ""Expecting"" isnt as charmless as you might have feared largely due to a cast working furiously to sell every scene. PHOTOS BROOKLYN DECKER AND MORE STARS COMPETING AGAINST THEMSELVES AT THE BOX OFFICE The setting is Atlanta where apparently (who knew?) sex al fresco is all the rage -- two couples wind up preggers after encounters in a public park. They are Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) and Gary (Ben Falcone) whove been trying to conceive for two years; and food-truck rivals Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford) who hook up on the spur of the moment and definitely arent trying. Elsewhere fitness-show host Jules (Cameron Diaz) and Evan (Matthew Morrison of ""Glee"") her partner in an ersatz ""Dancing With the Stars"" also find themselves unintentionally in the family way. Rounding out the parade of procreation are NASCAR driver Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) Garys father and his trophy wife Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) and Jennifer Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro as a couple whove decided to adopt. Whatever Lopez has always had shes still got it; shes the only one who gets to show a variety of emotions and the scene where she and Santoro get their baby is the sole authentically touching moment in the film. Decker is pretty cute in a very retro dumb blonde role. Banks can be screechy but her descent into a pregnancy that offers every unpleasant side effect in the book also yields some laughs. Diaz gets the fewest breaks from the script as her character bullies her baby daddy over the question of circumcision -- you knew the filmmakers couldnt pass up that topic. For a movie so squarely aimed at a female audience its odd and quite frustrating that the moms-to-be are such nags flinging their hormonal emotions all over Atlanta while the men do little but squirm and react. Nobody thought this book was going to morph into ""Rosemarys Baby"" but given that its 2012 and not 1984 (when it was first published) its depressing that zero chances were taken. Forget including a single mother or a same-sex couple -- ""What To Expect"" cant even acknowledge a world where sometimes its the man whos itching for a baby and the woman who dreads the loss of freedom sleep and sex drive. There are some amusing jabs at reality television; Chris Rock shows up as de facto leader of a daddies group and thank goodness hes still able to make a line sound a lot funnier than it is. On the whole however theres nothing here thats unexpected.

Starring Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez Elizabeth Banks Chris Rock Release Opened May 18 2012  Editorial Review Youve come a wrong way babyBy Stephanie MerryFriday May 18 2012Since it was first published in 1984 Heidi Murkoffs ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" the go-to pregnancy guide with the colorful quilt-patterned cover has landed in the hands of an endless stream of expectant moms and dads. The books mission is clear to shed light on the scary exhilarating phase known as new parenthood. The intentions of the ensemble film comedy that shares the books title are less obvious. Is director Kirk Joness film a farce populated by crazy caricatures? Or is it a crash course in every potential prenatal complication? How about a dramatic account of failed pregnancy attempts and first bonds? The movie turns out to be a little of everything yet succeeds only occasionally at anything. The big-name actors arrive on-screen in pairs marching two-by-two toward the pitfalls of first-time parenthood. The characters include Jules (Cameron Diaz) a me-me-me type of a workout fanatic who hosts a fictionalized ""The Biggest Loser"" and meets Evan (Matthew Morrison) on a show that resembles ""Dancing With the Stars."" When she becomes pregnant after just a few months of secretly dating him the couple has to navigate some sticking points including matching his-and-hers oversize egos which are not so easily shelved as monogrammed towels. A more serious and relatable couple Holly (Jennifer Lopez) and Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) have dealt with fertility problems money problems and -- once they get the chance to adopt a baby from Ethiopia -- a case of cold feet. These two couples alone could fill out a movies minutes but the pairs keep coming. Food-truck proprietor Rosie (Anna Kendrick) faces the implications of a one-night stand with her professional competition Marco (Chace Crawford); Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) and Gary (Ben Falcone) finally get positive news after two years of ovulation alerts; and Garys retired race-car-driving father Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) finds out that his trophy wife Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) is expecting twins. The most enjoyable portions of the movie have little to do with any of those characters. When Alex wanders into a ""dudes group"" essentially a Greek chorus of dads the moment arrives for funnyman Chris Rock to steal the show as Vic. He and his posse strut onto the scene in slow motion BabyBjorned and pushing strollers to the tune of the Notorious B.I.G.s ""Big Poppa."" These recurring sequences offer a chance for the guys to admit their foibles -- dropping kids off changing tables and into toilets -- but also to sing the praises of fatherhood which is surprisingly sweet. The dialogue facial expressions and comic timing of these talented actors are enough to carry the scenes but once again screenwriters Shauna Cross and Heather Hach take something that works and throw on unnecessary additions. In this case a repeated sight gag involving Vics accident-prone son falling prey to various obstacles pushes the limits of comedy. A similarly horrified reaction may arise during a scene involving a golf cart sailing into a swimming pool full of people. The punch line may prove less amusing than alarming for those with even a hint of maternal (or paternal) instincts. The outlandish moments reach their heights with Wendys story but Banks manages to add some realism to her role of a woman struggling with the less-glowing aspects of pregnancy including nausea flatulence and hemorrhoids. If those afflictions ring true for some moms other bits such as when a woman delivers effortlessly while sneezing exist only in Hollywood. The reality-fantasy paradox means audience members may get left behind when the film shifts into more serious terrain to contemplate lost jobs lost pregnancies and life-threatening losses of blood. For nearly 30 years Murkoffs book has maintained its staying power by giving readers precisely what its title implies. But what to expect from the movie? Among the hodgepodge of near-death moments and slapstick pratfalls its anybodys guess.Contains language and sexual content.

Starring Cameron Diaz Elizabeth Banks Chris Rock and Matthew Morrison. Directed by Kirk Jones. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Recently this has become a familiar form for romantic comedies Take a theme or an idea populate it with several couples going through the same thing either at different stages or from different angles and put it all together. This strategy has given us outright bombs (""New Years Eve"") and successes too such as ""Think Like a Man."" And now comes ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" a hit-and-miss effort built around the subject of pregnancy. Taking its name from the perennial pregnancy manual the picture follows five couples. Matthew Morrison and Cameron Diaz are TV personalities who meet on a show something like ""Dancing With the Stars."" Jennifer Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro are an infertile couple planning a foreign adoption. Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford are young people whose first encounter results in pregnancy. Brooklyn Decker plays a trophy wife pregnant with twins. And Elizabeth Banks is the author of baby books who finds out that the experience of pregnancy is a lot different from the idea of it. This is the fourth film from director Kirk Jones who in his previous efforts such as ""Nanny McPhee"" and ""Everybodys Fine"" found ways to balance the dark and the light the absurd and the dramatic. He has a harder time here because the material is more erratic - there is a cobbled-together feeling to the screenplay by Shauna Cross and Heather Hach. Still good moments come through. Kendrick for example plays a very young woman who gets pregnant by a guy she barely knows then has a miscarriage that one might easily regard as providential. But it doesnt seem that way to her - shes saddened by the loss - and though I can barely believe in that character I believe Kendrick; that is in the emotion that she brings to the role. The pivot of ""What to Expect"" is Banks as a pregnant woman going through nonstop discomfort and violently shifting hormonal mood swings. The subject of pregnancy has a way of flying off into airy sentimentality but Banks who is very funny keeps the movie grounded in the grinding physical details. The scene in which she presents her baby book while battling incontinence and flatulence is the best in the movie. Inevitably with a movie like this you will be interested in some characters less than others. For example the people played by Diaz and Morrison seemed to me so ill-matched that it was hard to imagine their lasting six months past the birth of the child. And though Lopez has some well-acted moments as a woman so intent on having a child that she used 401(k) money to finance in vitro fertilization something about the mix of comedy and drama in her story feels off. In the end ""What to Expect"" isnt an inspired movie but a manufactured one but one with some laughs and some moments. Plus it has Chris Rock who gets to liven things up as the ringleader of a beleaguered fathers group.

Or Valentines Day on fertility drugs.Calling itself ""loosely based"" on the best-selling pregnancy manual theres little of any value here. Observations are decidedly shallow Pregnant women get indigestion and men dont always share womens feelings about having a baby. A satiric look at the nine months of human gestation could have been plenty funny but bland mockery and tin-eared one-liners dont add up to humor.About the movieWhat to Expect When Youre Expecting out of fourStars Jennifer Lopez Cameron Diaz Matthew Morrison Elizabeth Banks Chris Rock Rodrigo Santoro Director Kirk JonesDistributor Lionsgate Films Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content thematic elements and language Running time 1 hour 50 minutes Opens today nationwideInstead the film recycles cliches and wallows in pregnancy side effects like hemorrhoids flatulence and cankles.Those maladies -- and more -- afflict Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) who owns a retail store called Breast Choice. Though a pregnancy expert she foolishly expects to glow beatifically through all three trimesters. Her miseries are contrasted with the picture-perfect bikini-clad pregnancy of her leggy blond stepmother-in-law Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) the trophy wife of blowhard race car driver Ramsey (Dennis Quaid). Inexplicably Ramsey cant help but compete with his dentist son Gary (Ben Falcone) Wendys husband. Their rivalry is the source of some of the most inane scenes especially a golf cart chase that culminates with Gary crashing into his fathers pool during his stepmothers over-the-top baby shower.Cameron Diaz plays TV fitness guru Jules whose romance with Evan (Matthew Morrison) her partner on a celebrity dance show lands her in the family way. But their busy careers make it hard to be in the same place at the same time. Still they manage to find time to argue ad nauseam over whether or not to to circumcise their baby.What to Expect LA premiereHolly (Jennifer Lopez) and Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) are a married couple adopting a child. As a baby portrait photographer Holly is more than ready. But Alex a music promoter is less certain. Enter the ""Dudes Group.""Alex joins the daddy pack led by Chris Rock for weekly stroller crawls through the park. The dudes are shown walking in slow motion even drinking from baby bottles. Laughing yet? They delight in sharing their child-rearing battle scars one found his kid swimming in the toilet another proclaims his baby ate a cigarette.A tad less formulaic is the story revolving around rival food truck chefs Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford) whose brief dalliance results in a pregnancy.Director Kirk Jones intertwines these unconvincing characters stories in a ham-fisted style. For a movie that purports to show audiences that no matter what plans are made things dont always go as expected its maddeningly predictable -- from natural-childbirth advocate Wendys cries for drugs during delivery to its ultimate support of traditional family values.

"Movie review What to Expect When Youre Expecting - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-PregnancyReview Expect little from What to ExpectThe movie version of the pregnancy how-to book is a confusing shallow ensemble piece with big stars about five couples at different stages of coming parenthood.May 18 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Evan (Matthew Morrison) and Jules (Cameron Diaz) in ""What to Expect... (Melissa Moseley MCT )""What to Expect When Youre Expecting""is essentially the Hallmark card version of the sage saucy and very specific how-to bestseller by Heidi Murkoff. The movies sentimental squibs on pregnancy merely skim the surface scratched so thoroughly by the book.As Murkoff knew and mined so well there is a lot of nature-made comedy to be found in the discomforts of distended bodies raging hormones and altered relationships. There is also pathos and pain especially for couples who cant conceive. The movie directed by Kirk Jones (""Nanny McPhee"") from a screenplay by Shauna Cross (""Whip It"") and Heather Hach (""Freaky Friday"") has grand ambitions and has signed on a cast of thousands (only a slight exaggeration) to try to touch all those bases.But rather than the engaging enlightenment of the source the film becomes bloated by confusion. It opens by parachuting into the lives of five couples in various states of impending parenthood then drops in on a ""Dudes Group"" of four already-entrenched dads and the cool guy who keeps turning up to remind the fathers of what theyre missing. Running around the edges are countless tykes none of whom are even slightly memorable despite their extreme cuteness.A considerable amount of star power gets expended in spinning out the complex coupling stories. Theres Cameron Diaz and Matthew Morrison a television fitness guru and a dancer respectively who meet on a ""Dancing With the Stars""-type show and end up with a bun in the oven.Then theres Elizabeth Banks as a militant mommy wannabe who runs a bookstore on all things baby and breast feeding; she and her hubby-with-daddy issues is Ben Falcone and theyre struggling to conceive. Playing Falcones moneybags father is Dennis Quaid who has a trophy wife in Brooklyn Decker who guess what winds up pregnant with twins.If thats not enough to keep track of Jennifer Lopez plays a photographer and shes hoping to adopt a child from Africa with her mate the handsome Rodrigo Santoro (who knows what he does and who cares?). Meanwhile Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford are former high school flames now food-truck competitors suddenly dealing with a one-night stand shocker.It goes on. Leading the post-pregnancy flank is Chris Rock who runs the daddy ""Dudes Group"" that includes Tom Lennon Rob Huebel Amir Talai and a ton of little kids. If that werent enough to keep up with there is Joe Manganiello enviable for his zero body fat and zero responsibilities.Mentioning actual characters names would only further confuse things. Lets just say the filmmakers should have considered bringing on someone from ESPNs""SportsCenter"" to give us the play by play.As a filmmaker Jones seems to favor what-makes-people-tick tales a his best was his first 1998s ""Waking Ned Devine."" ""What to Expect"" has moments that reach the emotional resonance and clever irony of ""Neds"" fanciful fable about greed avarice and the untimely demise of a lottery winner. But more often the ensemble comedy with its many entanglements flounders badly.Lopez and Santoro give their adopting couple a nice balance of sizzle and sadness almost enough to produce a few tears. Decker milks the most comedy out of the fewest lines underplaying her hand perfectly as she dotes on her older stepson (Falcone) scolds her much older hubby and embraces her daughter-in-law (Banks).Speaking of which Banks who brings such a stinging wit as Alec Baldwins characters Type-A fiancA(c)e on""30 Rock"" seems adrift here and cute couple Kendrick and Crawford are completely lost at sea. But the guys in the Dudes Group have the worst of it a they are a whiny unappealing bunch through and through.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESPreventing Teen-Age Pregnancies  Planned Parenthood...October 23 1986MORE STORIES ABOUTPregnancyCouplesStar PowerParenthoodCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-what-to-expect-20120518,0,2344465.story?track=rss",200,whattoexpectwhenyou'reexpecting12,whattoexpectwhenyou'reexpecting,latimes

Heres hoping that audiences unfortunate enough to see ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" undergo a similar bout of amnesia. This insipid comedy uses the best-selling pregnancy guide as a jumping-off point for multiple overlapping storylines almost all of them banal trite and hackneyed. Strangely enough the only memorable moments of this mess come when things get serious despite the track record of director Kirk Jones who demonstrated most recently with ""Everythings Fine"" that hes not particularly good with all-star ensembles or with sentimentality. Among the threads of this film are a baby-boutique owner (Elizabeth Banks) finally becoming pregnant at the same time as her husbands (Ben Falcone) younger stepmother (Brooklyn Decker); a young food-truck chef (Anna Kendrick) getting one in the oven after a one-night stand with a culinary rival (Chace Crawford); a TV weight-loss guru (Cameron Diaz) and her partner (Matthew Morrison) from a celebrity dance competition show try to figure out how to fit a baby into their career-driven lives; and a married couple (Jennifer Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro) face the possibility of adoption. Cue the gags about water breaking hemorrhoids screaming for epidurals and just about every other cliche imaginable. There are lots of ""I thought you wanted this baby too"" arguments and daddy conflicts (Falcones character has spent his life in competition with his NASCAR-racing daddy played by Dennis Quaid) and predictable jokes about bladder control and weight gain. What you wont find are any same-sex couples conceiving -- even though baby fever in the gay and lesbian community seems like its at an all-time high -- or any people of color going into the delivery room (all the ethnic minorities here either have kids already or cant give birth to their own) or any jokes that feel fresher than 1985. When Lopez and Santoro have real conversations about adoption or when one of the characters suddenly miscarries ""What to Expect"" actually achieves a certain poignancy suggesting that this enterprise might have worked better as a drama with occasional laughs than as a comedy with a few tear-jerking moments. The cast is uniformly fine although you can practically feel them chafing against the moronic things theyre called upon to do and say. And after the dreadful ""Friends with Kids"" this is the second movie of 2012 that suggests there might be a ""Bridesmaids"" curse. (Falcone Rebel Wilson and Wendi McClendon-Covey are all alums from last summers hit.) In a year when womens reproductive freedoms are constantly in the political crosshairs ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" feels like just another affront to anyone who owns and operates a uterus.

In the mercifully small genre of Hollywood movies adapted from self-help books ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" ranks roughly in the top third above ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" and ""Think Like a Man"" below ""Mean Girls"" and way below the seminal (sorry) ""Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask."" The movies a canned studio confection -- one of those ensemble comedy-dramas with multiple plots and predictable dilemmas and its closer to a greeting card like ""Valentines Day"" than anything else. But the writing is sharp and the performances bright and if youve been through the forced gestational march known as pregnancy there are knowing laughs to be had. If you havent do yourself a favor and stay away.The setting is Atlanta -- or the Georgia Chamber of Commerces version of Atlanta where every day is blissfully sunny except when the characters are sad and it rains. The story lines represent every variation on having a baby short of cloning. Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) a childrens book author and pregnancy store proprietor and her husband Gary (Ben Falcone of ""Bridesmaids"") are finally with child after years of trying. Baby photographer Holly (Jennifer Lopez) and Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) are adopting an infant from Ethiopia. Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford) are 20-something food truck rivals whose one-night stand lands them in the obstetrics ward. (Dont worry; Marco is mostly excited to be a dad and the A-word is allowed nowhere near the script.)Further out on the fringes are Jules (Cameron Diaz) an unwed LA fitness guru and TV reality host knocked up by her ""Celebrity Dance Factor"" partner Evan (Matthew Morrison of ""Glee""); she eventually lands in Atlanta but it takes some serious backbending by screenwriters Shauna Cross and Heather Hach to get her there. The most broadly comic couple are Garys father Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) a superstud NASCAR racer and his trophy wife Skyler (swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker); theyre having twins and Skylers pregnancy is proceeding with the kind of easy glow that makes other mothers spit blood.""What to Expect"" takes its title and some of its concerns from the best-selling guide by Heidi Murkoff; if youve had a kid in the past three decades you probably have an anxiously dog-eared copy on a shelf somewhere. The book covered the basics with a conversational tone and a welcome lack of hysteria; the movie alternates many of Murkoffs talking points with character comedy and little life lessons. Bacne? Bed rest? Epidurals? All here. Some of the unhappier aspects of pregnancy are alluded to with as delicate a touch as the movie can muster but if you want to know about pre-eclampsia you really should read the book.""What to Expect"" is most comfortable letting its large cast carom off each other with zingers and issues. The funniest scenes -- they constitute a whole other movie actually -- are those involving the Dude Group a quartet of Snugli-wearing dads who rule the park playground and teach Alex the ropes. Chris Rock plays Vic the unofficial leader and the movie needs as many of his raucously astute observations as it can get.Is it too much to ask that Vic notice hes the only black guy with a semi-major role in a city thats 54 percent African-American? Of course it is just as such gnarly topics as single motherhood teen pregnancy and pre-term births remain safely offscreen. If it werent for the cast ""What to Expect"" might Hallmark itself to death but Banks Falcone Quaid Kendrick and (surprisingly) Decker give their lines a topspin that almost convinces us the characters are real people rather than types. A scene where Wendy has a meltdown while speaking at a pregnancy expo is glibly amusing stuff but Banks finds the anger to make it stick.That said 10 main characters is too much to juggle and the movie develops stretch marks (again sorry) in the final race to the birthing rooms. Director Kirk Jones (""Waking Ned Devine"") does what he can to move things along but after a certain point his job is traffic management. Hes an improvement over Garry Marshall at least and the movie is as pleasant as it is harmless. The unintended message of ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" is that its all in the delivery.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Baby photographer Jennifer Lopez who cant conceive plans an Ethiopian adoption with hubby Rodrigo Santoro.

Maternity expert Elizabeth Banks and her chubby hubby Ben Falcone struggle to conceive while his race car driver daddy Dennis Quaid knocks up trophy wife Brooklyn Decker almost instantly. If What-When rises slightly above Marshalls sinkhole level thank Chris Rock as the leader of a dads group. Rock actually earns his laughs. With one child strapped to his chest Rock advises the other dads not to contemplate the cost of college. Before choosing denial he says ""I cried in my car for hour."" Rock is the one bonus in a movie that works best only if you dramatically drop your expectations. I appreciated Kendrick and Chase for staying low-key. The rest of the cast takes the opposite tack. Morning sickness afflicts most of the potential mommies. For me the movie itself triggered the vomiting.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Hollywoods relentless quest for pre-sold film properties has moved to the advice and self-help section of the bookstore with recent romantic comedy adaptations of ""Hes Not That Into You"" and ""Think Like a Man."" Now comes ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" which fashions the pregnancy guide into an amiable but disjointed movie with too many stories and not enough storytelling. Intertwining the experiences of five Atlanta couples and twice as many supporting characters director Kirk Jones creates a traffic-jam movie thats all subplot and no plot. In its place we get formulas. Accidentally pregnant Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford) wonder if they can be a couple. Infertile Holly (Jennifer Lopez) and Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) imitate a perfect parental unit to impress the adoption agency. Unmarried TV celebrities Jules (Cameron Diaz) and Evan (Matthew Morrison) ... um ... wonder if they can be a couple. Childrens author Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) and her schlubby hubby Gary (Ben Falcone) find themselves in a neonatal rivalry with Garys NASCAR star dad Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) and his trophy wife Skyler (Brooklyn Decker). Overwhelmed? Theres more with a dads support group of stroller-pushing fathers including Thomas Lennon and Chris Rock. Any movie with Chris Rock in it is automatically a better movie especially when he ad-libs his own dialogue as he appears to be doing here. But his presence raises the question of why a film set in Atlanta has so few black characters. ""Think Like a Man"" aimed at a predominantly black demographic was much more inclusive as well as a whole lot funnier. The film features a lot of ""my hormones are making me crazy"" humor for the women and ""this is too much responsibility"" scenes for the men but most of all it is fixated on cheesy reality television. Every couple is somehow linked to creating or consuming TV or both. I guess if that is the staple of your entertainment diet ""What to Expect"" is a fun night out by comparison. Otherwise dont expect too much.

Unlike its source material which reflects a recognizable world where mothers-to-be get morning sickness and fathers-to-be get sympathetic pregnancies the movie unfolds in a parallel universe where (almost) everyone has his or her own television reality show. Slideshow What to Expect When Youre Expecting premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about What to Expect When Youre Expecting >> Thus theres the celebrity personal trainer (Cameron Diaz) host of a program much like The Biggest Loser with child by her dance partner (Matthew Morrison) a professional hoofer on a show much like So You Think You Can Dance? There are rival food-truck chefs (Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford) resembling contestants on The Great Food Truck Race. After their one-night stand they have a muffin in the oven. Theres the retired NASCAR legend (Dennis Quaid) and his trophy wife (Brooklyn Decker). They have no problem conceiving and do so apparently at the same nanosecond as his grown son (Ben Falcone) and baby-expert wife (Elizabeth Banks) who have been struggling to make a baby for years. And then theres an account executive (Rodrigo Garcia) and his baby-photographer wife (Jennifer Lopez) in their third trimester of adoption anticipation. This pair the only ones without celeb connections is also the most glam couple in Atlanta. One is repeatedly reminded that WTEWYE is an alternative universe because although this is Atlanta Chris Rock is virtually the only African American who is not a gynecologist or a nurse. Rock plays Garcias pal the leader of a gang of glum stroller-pushing papas mourning the days when they regarded lady parts as pleasure producers rather than baby makers. According to Rocks character baby world ""is where happiness goes to die."" If Rock were prescribed as birth control surely he would be 99.9 percent effective. So what are he and his band of dour dudes doing in a movie celebrating the multiple arrivals of ""little angels""? Ask Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) the driver of this omnibus that alternately reveres and desecrates its source Heidi Murkoffs baby ""Bible."" Ask scribes Shauna Cross (writer of the wonderful Whip It) or Heather Hach (the hilarious Freaky Friday remake) if soiled diaper cloths are really the most effective antidotes to baby fever. Admittedly the movie has moments. In her move from slapstick to solemn and back again Banks is deft and affecting. As they participate in an African adoption ritual Lopez and Garcia are moving. The filmmakers do little to unify the multi-strand narrative and its ensuing extreme mood shifts. So although this multicharacter stew has a tasty morsel or two in the aggregate it makes one long for the comparative complexity and subtlety of Valentines Day.

Several women deal with pregnancy and adoption. Director Kirk Jones. (150) PG-13 Language. Area theaters. You know exactly what to expect from the bulk of ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting."" What you dont expect is how bad almost all of it is. Which may be some sort of in-joke on the part of the filmmakers. (You think pregnancy is ""Valentines Day"" bad? ""New Years Eve"" bad? No its worse.) But despite a few moments of levity provided by Chris Rock and a bit of lightness provided by one womans trouble-free childbearing this movie version of the 80s gestation guidebook may be the first movie to actually induce morning sickness. There are five occasionally intersecting Atlanta-set storylines all of which are pitched at the level of a bad sitcom. A personal trainer/reality show star (Cameron Diaz) and her dance-program partner (Matthew Morrison) try not to let a bun in the oven ruin their careers and partnership on or off TV. Meanwhile a baby-supply store owner (Elizabeth Banks) and her shlubby hubby (Ben Falcone) compete emotionally with his NASCAR stud dad (Dennis Quaid) and the studs new trophy wife (Brooklyn Decker). Across town rival food truck employees (Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford) find themselves potential parents after a one-night stand. And a photographer (Jennifer Lopez) hired to snap pics of some of these folks future tots pursues adoption with her hesitant mate (Rodrigo Santoro). To calm his nerves he starts to hang with a ""dudes group"" of dads led by Rock who tell him how wise men of the (diaper)cloth do it. Director Kirk Jones who did alright by multiple storylines in his 2009 ""Everybodys Fine"" and showed a welcome lack of sentimentality in ""Nanny McPhee"" combines the titular self-help book with the Garry Marshall playbook. The result is a salesman-y piece of fluff. Lopez and Diaz the marquee names here have the toughest sell. Diaz acts as if having a prosthetic tummy attached to her is license to be bigger-than-life across the board. Meanwhile Lopez actually has the movies most touching scene when she goes to Somalia to meet the child whose life shell change. Even then however the tone is pandering not parental. RELATED JENNIFER LOPEZ ON HER NEW MOVIE And the inclusion of what was likely considered wacky ""guy-centric"" comedy seems incongruous a golf-cart chase between Quaids bad dad and his angry son Falcone being the worst example. Still Rocks been-there changed-that manner is welcome and Decker and Quaids nonchalance at their no-hassle pregnancy qualifies for easygoing in ""What to Expect."" Otherwise this movie regularly pushes too hard. Magic Moment A group of dads form a human chain as they lift up four strollers en masse to navigate stairs.

Photo Credit handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Five couples grapple with impending parenthood. BOTTOM LINE Clearly calculated to pull in every possible pregnant demographic but also genuinely funny and likeable thanks to its energetic cast. CAST Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez Chace Crawford Rodrigo Santoro. LENGTH 150 ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" might be called a census comedy the kind of movie thats based less on a story than on a statistical trend. That means its main concern is not plot or dialogue but demographics Do you see yourself on screen? Is your particular situation addressed? Does the movie ""get it right""? It does thanks mainly to its large and likable cast. With 10 main characters and nearly as many smaller players ""What to Expect"" attempts to cover every possible type of motherhood in America and very nearly succeeds. Theres one glaring exception but more on that later. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Racial diversity is less important here than a range of ages. Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford play post-collegiates in a family way but theyre yesterdays issue; director Kirk Jones (""Everybodys Fine"") is clearly more interested in the over-30 crowd. Cameron Diaz and Matthew Morrison play reality-show stars Jules and Evan (shes a fat-loss guru hes a dance-off type) who represent the career-minded contingent; Elizabeth Banks and Ben Falcone are average middle-classers Wendy and Gary. Dennis Quaid and Brooklyn Decker play Ramsey and Skyler an aging NASCAR driver and his newest trophy who are having twins. Based on the bestselling maternity guide ""What to Expect"" essentially uses the books list of clinical symptoms as fodder for jokes. Banks gamely makes herself the butt of them while Decker is perfectly cast as an annoyingly radiant mom-to-be. Screenwriters Shauna Cross (""Whip It"") and Heather Hach wisely add a ""Dudes Group"" of beleaguered dads led by the excellent Chris Rock a real-life father of two whos clearly been gathering material. Jennifer Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro play a couple grappling with adoption but that topic is too emotionally fraught for this breezy film. (Ditto for the hospital-room scares which provide weak drama.) The one demographic missing single mothers. Well maybe next census. 234 VideoWhat To Expect When Youre Expecting PLOT Five couples grapple with impending parenthood.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet With more than 14 million copies in circulation What To Expect When Youre Expecting has become the standard self-help text helping (and terrifying) legions of first-time mothers with tips on the various stages of pregnancy those early months of childhood development and in this big-screen iteration at least what to do if theyre feeling morning sickness while appearing as a celebrity contestant on the Dancing With The Stars finale. (Answer to the last one Stick the routine throw up in the trophy.) As fascinating as a faithful adaptation might have been--imagine a transitional stool montage set to ""Turn Turn Turn (To Everything There Is A Season)""--the film is mostly an excuse to do a pregnancy-themed Love Actually an overblown symphony of birthing stories that reaches its crescendo in the maternity ward. Or to use the appropriate parlance its bloated though the waves of nausea here come more in the third trimester than the first. In a rare case of characters in a movie reading the book being adapted five different women ovulating in scripted harmony have diverse experiences in the lead-up to having their first child. Cameron Diaz plays the Type-A host of a Biggest Loser-type TV show who risks complications by pushing herself too hard. Elizabeth Banks plays the owner of a baby store whose absurdly idealized birth plan in an irony too obvious to pass up gets swamped by a rough pregnancy. Meanwhile her glamorous mother-in-law Brooklyn Decker a cheery trophy wife to a former NASCAR champion (Dennis Quaid) carries twins without an ounce of discomfort. In other threads freelance photographer Jennifer Lopez prods her reluctant husband (Rodrigo Santoro) into adopting a child in Ethiopia and food-truck proprietor Anna Kendrick gets knocked up in a one-night-stand with a rival cook (Chace Crawford). To be fair What To Expect When Youre Expecting honors its source about as well as the movie version of the nonfiction polemic Fast Food Nation--characters and stories have to be invented of course but it touches on many different aspects of pregnancy and the range of experiences women can have. But for every time the film touches on some simple relatable truth about the trials of bringing a child into the world there are five or six outrageous comic setpieces that diminish it. That is unless theres a section about driving a golf cart into a swimming pool in later editions.

Whats next Jennifer Aniston and Ashton Kutcher in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People? Adapted from Heidi Murkoffs celebrated 1984 pregnancy bible What to Expect takes six lightly sketched couples and weaves them into the impending-motherhood equivalent of a synthetic ensemble rom-com. As sociology its skin-deep but if youre a parent or preparing to be one you might see yourself in a few of these folks and have a good time doing so. Elizabeth Banks is terrific as a baby-book author having her first child -- a woman in the full dramatic throes of the bodily-function awkwardness of pregnancy. Ben Falcone (Bridesmaids) is equally good as her doting milquetoast husband though Dennis Quaid is stuck playing an alpha-male cartoon as Falcones ex-racing-star father (who is having twins with his trophy wife). Cameron Diaz (as a fitness-guru reality-show host) and Matthew Morrison spar painfully well as a couple who cant agree on whether their future son should be circumcised and Jennifer Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro are touching as a couple out to adopt. Theres also a very funny pack of defeated dads who carry themselves like the living dead. Last and least Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford act out an unconvincing bite-size Knocked Up. What to Expect is sort of thrown together but thats okay The movie hits authentic notes of anxiety and joy.

What to Expect When Youre Expecting Bad Director Kirk Jones. Cast Cameron Diaz Matthew Morrison Jennifer Lopez. Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content thematic elements and language. The worst thing about ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" director Kirk Jones fictionalized film version is how fake it is how cartoonish the experiences. The film written by Shauna Cross and Heather Hach has almost nothing to do with the book. Instead it is a tired generic romantic comedy with a little drama thrown in thats just as much of a stretch as the supposedly funny bits. Jones bounces back and forth among five couples going through pregnancies some by design some by accident. Hotlist Nine films about babies Interview Elizabeth Banks talks Expecting Interview Jennifer Lopez Rodrigo Santoro Jules (Cameron Diaz) a celebrity fitness instructor is paired on a ""Dancing With the Stars""-type show with Evan (Matthew Morrison) and their relationship goes a little farther than waltzes and foxtrots. This impacts their careers and their headstrong personalities. Holly (Jennifer Lopez) and Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) cant have a baby so they decide to adopt though shes a lot more enthusiastic about the plan than he is. Holly convinces him to join a ""dudes group"" guys who take their kids for the day and walk around a park; that this group includes Chris Rock and Thomas Lennon is a major plus. The guys practically worship at the feet of Davis (Joe Manganiello) a muscular single guy who keeps photos of various global conquests on his cell phone. Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) and Gary (Ben Falcone) have tried and tried to have a baby for years; when they finally stop trying it happens. Gary is a dentist Wendy the owner of a store that caters to breastfeeding women. Banks performance is probably the most genuine in the movie; she realizes that as she puts it pregnancy isnt all about ""glow."" Its also about being miserable sometimes as hormones rage out of control. Then there is Garys dad Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) a former NASCAR driver who has tortured his son all his life not just by competing with him in everything but by beating him. True to form Ramseys young wife Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) is also pregnant -- with twins. Finally there are Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford) who run competing food trucks and had a brief unhappy romance in high school. A chance meeting leads to a one-night stand and well see the title. Their story is actually something of a highlight which probably says more about the weakness of the others than the strength of this one. But they have a nice chemistry together. The problem is once we get interested Jones leaves them to look in on the other couples. Some of the pregnancies are played for laughs others are depicted more melodramatically. Its a mishmash of mediocrity. The performances are somewhat better than the material especially those of Banks Kendrick and Lopez. But theyre not nearly enough to offset the hackneyed plots they all find themselves trapped in. Whats odd is that with pregnancy almost anything goes -- the most outlandish behavior is explainable by the combination of changes to lifestyles and bodies. Yet ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" manages to make what should be relatable situations as foreign as if they were set on Mars. Except theyre not. Who knows? That might have been a better movie. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Thats the mother of all rhetoricals and speaking of mothers This mostly laugh-free pregnancy comedy adapted from Heidi Murkoffs pop-parenting best-seller is at least a slight step up from director Kirk Joness last effort 2009s claw-your-eyes-out-awful Robert De Niro vehicle Everybodys Fine. Diaz plays one of five foxy ladies--the others are Jennifer Lopez Elizabeth Banks Brooklyn Decker and Anna Kendrick--who find themselves with child (Lopez avoids the prosthetic paunch since her character is going the Brangelina adoption route). Their respective significant others react to the storks-on-the-way news with everything from glassy-eyed shock to ""its all good"" shrugs; most of what hilarity there is comes from the gents befuddlement with impending fatherhood. Best in show is a clearly delighted Dennis Quaid as Deckers race-car-driving Jimmy Buffett-loving beau. His alpha-aggressive effusiveness (masking a soft heart) gives a movie populated with time-marking A-listers and up-and-comers some genuine life. The rest of this vignette-heavy piffle which follows each of the couples from conception to delivery milks the worst kind of newborn-fetishizing sentiment (how many ways can we talk about the ""miracle"" of childbearing without seeming too religious?) while inspiring eye rolls aplenty (laziest use of the Notorious B.I.G.s ""Hypnotize"" ever). If What to Expect represents the best tearjerking laugh-machine that Hollywood can birth its probably time to get those story ideas implanted in vitro.

For an industry banked on bathroom humor what could be more suitable than this vomit- piss- fart- foreskin- and flabby-vagina-filled tome? As adapted by Shauna Cross and Heather Hach and directed by Kirk Jones the film similarly fails to tell a coherent story create believable characters or establish any sense of place (its Atlanta is strenuously Anywheresville). It too capitalizes on the anxious-mom demographic and proves equally preoccupied with pregnancys corporeal side effects. The difference of course is that for all the fear loathing and overthinking that Murkoffs bedside text engenders its journey ends with the hopeful beginning of a new life whereas the movie leaves you hoping for a swift end to your own.That feeling has less to do with the terrors of pregnancy childbirth and parenting than it does with the gargoyles What to Expect presents as characters--a carnival-mirrored tableau of yuppie soullessness. The film opens appropriately enough within the warped confines of reality TV After taking the top prize in Celebrity Dance Factor Cameron Diazs go-go fitness guru Jules upchucks into her trophy bowl shocking both her dance/romantic partner Evan (Glees Matthew Morrison) and the nationally televised audience. ""Lets hope shes not pregnant folks"" quips the MC but as with any female who has ever felt nauseated on-screen she so is. Cut to a retail shop called ""Breast Choice"" which is run by Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) a Snuggie-wearing mom-wannabe obsessive with a doormat of a husband Gary (Ben Falcone); then to Jennifer Lopez as Holly a childless childrens-portrait photographer whos hoping to adopt an Ethiopian orphan despite the reservations of her callous hubby Alex (Rodrigo Santoro); then over to food-cart dreamboat Marco (Chace Crawford) who seduces neighboring vendor Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and sets the interconnected fertilization machine in motion. Even Garys oily NASCAR-driver dad Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) gets into the act when his trophy wife Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) starts harboring twins.Soon were cycling through baby bumps sonograms and punch-clock marital meltdowns between irrational irritating sex-withholding alpha gals and their resentful ineffectual patsies. ""Im the one with the bad eggs"" Lopez screams on a street corner her justifiable sorrow quickly overtaken by the implicit misogyny that the films baby-factory worldview affirms. ""Im the one who cant do the one thing that a woman is supposed to be able to do.""As you might expect from a future in-flight favorite What to Expect When Youre Expecting strictly follows Hollywoods culturally appeasing comedy template sophomoric mockery of all thats held sacred followed (and neatly corrected) by an affirmation of traditional values. ""I just wanted the glow"" a weary Banks tells a group of mothers-to-be ""but Im calling bullshit on the whole thing. Pregnancy sucks."" But demystification cedes to worship when the babe is in arms ""I finally found it. Hes my glow."" Nowhere is this turn more pronounced than in Santoros auditing of a ""dudes group"" in which dads strapped in Baby Bjorns and pushing Smart Car-size strollers let off some parental steam. Represented at first as a harrowing mess of errant children and castrated manhood (the men drink from baby bottles in mocking slo-mo) the group ultimately embodies an unambiguous veneration of parental sacrifice. Never mind all that was said before about economic hardship and identity crises. ""I wouldnt trade it for anything in the world"" says sloganeering ringleader Chris Rock.The film much like the culture at large insists that pleasure ends when parenting begins yet also that the parenting life is the only one worth living. God forbid there could be something in between. ""End of day familys all that matters"" says Quaid never mind that his characters abusive fathering made his son into an obese neurotic. ""Kids--thats all we really leave behind."" If thats true and if millions of years of biological intellectual and technological evolution must yield to shallow-field American family values the least we can do is cop to our shoddy legacy. Lets start with this disdainful demoralizing grimly unfunny bastard of a film.

Five couples endure the highs and lows of pregnancy in ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" a slight glossy star-topped comedy inspired by Heidi Murkoffs bestselling advice book. Though the pic shares little but its title with Murkoffs manual its nothing if not topical. Just as the book became essential reading among moms-to-be the movie citing more pregnancy trends than an obstetrics convention may become required viewing for expectant parents -- a designation owing less to its quality than to a lack of competition. First published in 1984 Murkoffs book was born out of her desire to find helpful peer-driven pregnancy information at a time when Dr. Spock had cornered the child-care market. Though some professionals deplored Murkoffs experience-guided approach the book remains a classic; four editions later its spawned a host of related titles and copycats. No surprise then that Hollywood finally came calling especially after ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" made the successful leap from page to screen. ""What to Expect"" is the latest in slick packaging Take a popular high-concept title weave together a limp tapestry from various loosely connected narrative strands and embellish the project with a full roster of marketable stars (most of whom didnt have to commit to a lengthy shooting schedule). Penned by Shauna Cross and Heather Hatch the pic makes much of the unexpected pregnancy. Celebrity fitness guru Jules (Cameron Diaz) is stunned to learn she and dancer b.f. Evan (Matthew Morrison) are pregnant. Likewise food-truck manager Rosie (Anna Kendrick) is surprised that a one-night stand with her hunky rival Marco (Chace Crawford) leaves her preggers. No one is more amazed than lactation specialist Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) who nearly threw in the towel after two years of trying with her husband Gary (Ben Falcone). Always looking to overshadow his son Garys dad Ramsey (Dennis Quaid) announces at a family brunch that he and trophy wife Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) are also expecting. Photographer Holly (a surprisingly nuanced Jennifer Lopez) and husband Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) become parents through adoption. After discovering a baby is coming their way from Ethiopia Holly is thrilled; Alex terrified. That leads Alex to solicit the advice of a ""dudes group"" a roving quartet of Baby Bjorn-outfitted stroller-toting dads including Chris Rock and the ever-acerbic Tom Lennon. Though they warn Alex he may never have fun again the guys also show a tender side to fatherhood. Thanks to Rocks deft delivery these scenes also generate the pics few big laughs. Helmer Kirk Jones (""Nanny McPhee"") does a solid job negotiating the material and managing the few tonal shifts when an occasional dark moment emerges miscarriage and a perilous delivery among them. Editor Michael Berenbaum too deploys smart visual cues to keep the momentum going. Given what it might have been its a bit of a shame that ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" isnt much more than a light-hearted star-studded infomercial for pregnancy -- but perhaps thats just what the OB ordered.

TWITTER Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez and Elizabeth Banks star in the film revolving around five expectant couples. Unlike the fact-filled best-seller that ""inspired"" it the big-screen version of What to Expect When Youre Expecting has nothing much to say -- nothing new that is. Spun from mostly stale scenarios about couples facing first-time parenthood the ensemble comedy sticks firmly to the middle of the road as it aims to reassure and comfort. Babies are miracles pregnancy can be a physical ordeal and men and women arent always on the same page of the emotional guidebook. Thats about as deep as it gets. What to Expect When Youre Expecting Trailer Spotlights the Dudes Group But predictable laughs likely will be more of an enticement than a repellent to the movies target audience. With an able cast led by Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez and Elizabeth Banks and a built-in curiosity factor for the multitudes who swear by the book the crowd-pleaser is primed for a smooth delivery at the box office especially as a femme-centric alternative to Battleship and The Dictator. The screenplay credited to Shauna Cross and Heather Hach revolves around five expectant couples. (It was shot in Atlanta with locally headquartered Delta Airlines getting prime product placement). Their stories crisscross with some of the interconnections revealed late in the overlong proceedings -- gratuitous asides more than dramatic kickers. VIDEO What to Expect When Youre Expecting Trailer Elizabeth Banks Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez Hit Pregnancy Walls For some couples pregnancy is an accident for others an obsession. In the former category are reality stars Jules (Diaz) and Evan (Matthew Morrison) and two twentysomethings (Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford) whose romance has just begun.  In fine rom-com tradition Rosie and Marcos flirtation begins in competition Theyre food-truck chefs comparing kitchen wounds and the energy in their early encounters borders on the screwball. Kendrick and Crawford are compellingly low-key in the only story strand thats cliche-free. Competition is a connective glue in the movie. The reality TV factor looms large with nods to celebrity dance-offs The Biggest Loser and less overtly The Great Food Truck Race. That makes sense in a movie built for wide appeal. There are also more psychological if not nuanced contests afoot. Among those pining for a baby is Wendy (Banks) the owner of a motherhood emporium called Breast Choice. A gifted comic actress Banks makes her characters generic transition -- from ovulation-app-wielding control freak to a woman at the mercy of her biology -- specific and watchable. Wendys mild-mannered husband (Ben Falcone) is locked in a lifelong competition with his alpha-male father a NASCAR hot dog played by a perfectly cast Dennis Quaid whose young wife (Brooklyn Decker) also happens to be pregnant. In the name of one-upmanship shes carrying twins and still doing Pilates a supermodel blonde having a super-pregnancy. STORY What to Expect When Youre Expecting Character Posters Revealed The least comic thread of the story involves Lopezs freelance photographer and her supportive but not-quite-ready-for-fatherhood husband (Rodrigo Santoro) as they prepare for adoption. Like everything else here its only partially realized. Amid the would-be and actual laughs the screenplay tries to drum up drama but every disagreement and tension is treated superficially and summarily resolved. A golf-cart race thats the climactic encounter for two characters sums up the level of narrative risk. And with each character serving chiefly as a facet of the Multifaceted Expectant Experience no subplot warrants true involvement. One couple receives bad news in a scene that recalls a tender moment from Up with none of the emotional impact. The screenwriters weave in a few factoids from the source material about the side effects and complications of impending motherhood and director Kirk Jones orchestrates a number of broad-stroke montages that take the couples from ultrasound through labor. Offering male-perspective commentary of sorts is a quartet of househusband dads led by Chris Rock -- a geek chorus laden with the latest baby gear and fully embracing their married-guy envy of ultra-bachelor Davis (Joe Manganiello). Jones (Waking Ned Devine Everybodys Fine) imparts no style or point of view to the hopscotching material. Karen Patchs costumes lend some character-defining oomph to the productions sitcom-smooth surface while an unlikely Mark Mothersbaugh contributes an unobtrusive score.
