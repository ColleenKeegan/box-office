Presumably Shawn Levy (the director of the first and an exec producer on this one) thought it a wheeze to introduce a new generation to the tomfoolery of blundering French detective Jacques Clouseau. Well he was wrong because the only connecting indeed redeeming feature of these remakes is Henry Mancinis marvellous opening theme.The Pink Panther 2 kicks off with by-the-book Inspector Clouseau (Steve Martin) clinging to a speeding car from which he is catapulted straight into the first of many deeply unfunny slapstick sequences. The story such as there isnt revolves around a dream team of international detectives (Andy Garcia Alfred Molina Yuki Matsuzaki) charged with capturing the elusive thief of the Pink Panther diamond. Against his superiors wishes (John Cleese funny for a change) Clouseau is assigned to the task and... you can guess the rest. On paper the wild n crazy Steve Martin would seem as good a bet as any to play the late Peter Sellerss disaster-prone detective; in practice however he is hopeless. Its not just his disappointing body language - something Sellers was especially good at - its his unamusing faux-French accent. Where Sellers got the inflection down to a politically-incorrect tee Martin fumbles it from the off. And that in a nutshell is reason enough to avoid this as one might any other calamity.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 7 2009 Save for later Saved Steve Martin left and Jean Reno shown in a scene from The Pink Panther 2. Peter Iovino/Columbia/Sony Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of When Steve Martin assumed the role of Inspector Clouseau in 2006 I was one of the few critics who actually praised him. Peter Sellers may have been brilliant in the first two ""Panther"" films but does anybody remember how laggard the later installments were? Martin a great physical comic with a genius for screwy foreign accents was perfect casting.Now we have ""The Pink Panther 2"" and the bloom is decidedly off the pinkish rose. Martin has a few inspired moments but in order to get to them you have to wade through a mosh pit of unfunny gags.As the bumbling French police detective Martin reclaims his nutso accent from the first film to diminishing effect. In the 2006 ""The Pink Panther"" I laughed uncontrollably when Clouseau taking speech lessons from an English language coach repeatedly mangled the word ""hamburger."" Martins deadpan lunacy in this scene was peerless. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""The Pink Panther 2"" director Harald Zwart and his co-writers (including Martin) cant come up with an equivalent to this scene - not even close. They are reduced to using ""hamburger"" all over again in a much less funny context. Now its the password for a SWAT team. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Pink Panther 2 The movies ostensible plot has something to do with an international team of experts who attempt to recover recently heisted priceless treasures from around the world including the Pink Panther diamond. Much to his slow-burn dismay Chief Inspector Dreyfus (John Cleese) is forced to assign Clouseau whom he has marginalized as a traffic cop to the team.Cleese has a funny bit early on when upon getting the news about the Clouseau assignment he excuses himself from the discussion goes into the adjoining bathroom and proceeds to pound his head - hard - against the fixtures. Its the only moment in the movie when Cleese is allowed to do anything except stew and simper.And then theres Lily Tomlin who has a brief unfunny cameo as an etiquette instructor at the Palais de Justice. Watching her play opposite Martin in this scene is an object lesson in how far Hollywood comedy has fallen. In 1984 Martin and Tomlin appeared together in the hilarious whirligig ""All of Me."" It was their first pairing together and inexplicably their last - until now. What must have been going through their minds in ""The Pink Panther 2"" as they played out their slapdash routines? Probably the same thing that was going through mine.Even the numerous physical comedy set-ups obviously designed for Martin literally fall flat. The karate bouts between Clouseau and the young sons of his partner (Jean Reno repeating his role from the first film) are execrably staged. So is a sequence where Clouseau dressed like a toreador impersonates a flamenco dancer. Its possible that Martins footwork in this last scene was dexterous but well never know. Zwarts cameras are doing their own dumb dance.The supporting cast of ""experts"" comes across as nondescript which is quite a feat considering that they include such normally volatile performers as Andy Garcia Alfred Molina and Bollywood bombshell Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The high-low point comes at the end when Molina on the losing side of a bet shows up in a pink tutu. Not a pleasant sight.There is also some supposedly risque humor involving the pope which is too doddering to be offensive and an overabundance of cheesy digitized shots of Paris. Zwart was aiming for a retro storybook look but the results are more like a cheesy travelogue replete with bleary process shots. (Much of the film was actually filmed in and around Boston.)One more qualm Real-life news reporters in this film show up playing themselves most notably Christiane Amanpour of CNN. I wish these luminaries would resist the temptation. I realize that news and showbiz have become almost indistinguishable but Id like to think that if Edward R. Murrow were alive today he wouldnt be agitating his agent for a chance to play himself in ""The Dark Knight."" Grade C (Rated PG for some suggestive humor brief mild language and action.)

So well do the honors. Pink Panther 2 Attack of the Clumsy Clone. Pink Panther 2 A Globe-Trotting Goof. Or perhaps one that provides an advisory Pink Panther 2 Stay Home and Bathe the Cat. Steve Martin reprises his reprise of Peter Sellers bumbling but resourceful Inspector Clouseau. Though Martin has a couple of funny physical gags he doesnt measure up to Sellers singular comic genius. Martin as Clouseau hams it up half-heartedly pushing the French accent in such an exaggerated direction that it brings Borat to mind. If someone were to attempt Clouseau again -- and were not saying anyone should -- Sacha Baron Cohen would be a better choice for this goofy role. Remember when Martin was funny? Its hard to figure how the same witty guy who writes thoughtful articles engaging books and even a droll play (Picasso at the Lapin Agile) could have co-written this leaden redux. The plot is wafer-thin and the acting is pallid. John Cleese has a funny moment or two as Clouseaus officious and annoyed boss Inspector Dreyfus. But the rest of the cast seems to be cringing their way through. And when theyre not we are. Alfred Molina a newcomer to the series threatens to wear a pink tutu if the bumbling Clouseau can solve the case of who has stolen the Magna Carta the popes ring and of course the Pink Panther diamond. And since its Clouseaus movie its certainly no spoiler to reveal that he does. And so Molina dutifully dons the tutu at the films predictable ending. Why not just dust off The Benny Hill Show? Andy Garcia plays a variation of the character he plays in the Oceans Eleven movies and Jean Reno doesnt seem to be having a good time at all. Both are members of the international team assembled to catch the master thief and retrieve the stolen artifacts. The most wooden acting in the film belongs to Bollywood superstar Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. She looks gorgeous but her expression rarely changes. In contrast Martin mugs exaggeratedly but to little avail. Hes best with the silly one-liners as when he meets with his fellow dream team of investigators ""Lets bring you up to speed. We know nothing. You are now up to speed."" Rather than reinvigorating the Panther comedy franchise from the 60s and 70s Martins version dumbs it down and wrings the zany fun out of it. Its as if the former stand-up comedian is going through the motions of humor with these and also those Cheaper by the Dozen movies assuming that youthful target audiences wont know the difference. Perhaps Martin should go back to taking chances and writing original work. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

This romantic comedy was spawned by the self-help manual of the same name and indirectly inspired by an episode of ""Sex and the City."" The film explores but mainly celebrates the extended adolescence of American men and women who in their 20s 30s and even 40s continue to befuddle themselves and one another with the bottomless mysteries of relationships. What did he/she mean as opposed to what he/she said? When will he/she call/text/Twitter? And how could I have been so dumb? The possibilities of the dating game are endless and the potential for pain is great yet the permutations of the movies plot are predictable and repetitive. At the same time for the same reasons the productions commercial prospects are bright. Its a star-encrusted vending machine that dispenses nuggets of conventional wisdom in zesty flavors. The cast includes Ben Affleck Jennifer Aniston Drew Barrymore Jennifer Connelly Ginnifer Goodwin Scarlett Johansson and Justin Long. Theyre in alphabetical order. If the characters they play were arranged in order of immaturity Ms. Goodwins Gigi would top the sorry list. Shes an obsessive-compulsive romantic who takes all of the movies bloated running time -- 129 minutes -- to absorb its basic message Judge guys by what they do not what they say. As a consequence the poor baby keeps waiting by her pink Princess phone for Mr. Wrong to ring and make her life right. (Her Princess is tethered to the only land line in a wireless world where as noted in the script by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein cell phones and caller ID have had a deep impact on dating patterns.) ENLARGE Ginnifer Goodwin Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Connelly in Hes Just Not That Into You. Warner Bros. Gigis endless neediness is frightening but her plight is played for laughs like almost everything and everyone around her. The comedy can be sharp from time to time especially in a few mock-documentary straight-to-the-camera interviews when supposed veterans of the relationship wars offer wry advice to the chronically lovelorn. And Jennifer Aniston sustains a nicely astringent tone as Beth a marketing executive at a spice company -- all occupations are generic -- whose need to tie the knot threatens to destroy her great relationship with Neil (Mr. Affleck) a marriage-averse photographer. For the most part though ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" feels like a sitcom that resolves each mini-dilemma before going to commercial. The films director Ken Kwapis has done far better work than this; his extensive TV credits include the pilots of ""The Office"" ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and ""The Bernie Mac Show."" So too has Jennifer Connelly distinguished herself in such dramatic roles as a drug addict in ""Requiem for a Dream"" and John Nashs wife Alicia Nash in ""A Beautiful Mind."" Unfortunately her character here another spice merchandiser named Janine seems to have lost her mind. Janine hates lying -- we get that -- and her husband is a casual liar; we get that too. But Ms. Connellys ferocious wrath might better have been reserved for a revival of ""Medea."" Instead of lightening up she darkens down. The Pink Panther 2 If ""The Pink Panther 2"" were merely a minimalist approach to the classic series it might have been in keeping with Steve Martins own esthetic; hes a past master of subtle comedy. But the movie is minimumist -- as bare-bones as a ""Panther"" can be and still get away with it. This time the ever-bumbling Inspector Clouseau is on the ever-meandering trail of a thief who steals such priceless artifacts as the Magna Carta (nothing is made of that theft) the Shroud of Turin (Clouseau calls the pontiff Mr. Pope and detects that hes very spiritual) and the Pink Panther Diamond whose re-disappearance -- it was stolen in the previous film too -- may have been required for the perfunctory script to fill 90 minutes. That film gave Steve Martin his first crack at a character famously played by Peter Sellers and Alan Arkin and he pulled the role off with beguiling panache. This time he goes through the motions plus a few gyrations as a flamenco dancer with a dogged sense of duty thats shared by other prisoners of the shabby production Jean Reno Emily Mortimer John Cleese and Lily Tomlin who plays a strident enforcer of political correctness. The soundtrack makes generous use of trombones to indicate humor. Coraline Creating ""Coraline"" See an interactive graphic on the seven-year production process required for the making of the 3-D stop-motion movie. ""Coraline"" is Henry Selicks stop-motion 3-D version of Neil Gaimans fantasy novel about a young girl who discovers on the other side of a brick wall an alternate version of her happy home with an Other Mother who seems more loving than her own. Anyone who has seen Mr. Selicks earlier animated features ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" knows of his abundant gifts for graphic design. But ""Coraline"" is distinguished if you can call it that by a creepiness so deep as to seem perverse and the film finally succumbs to terminal deficits in dramatic energy narrative coherence and plain old heart. Even the 3-D effects fall into a no-puppets-land between art and technical oddity; some figures pop out from the screen fully modeled others stay stubbornly flat. Thats a relatively minor issue however in a childrens entertainment thats much too scary for little kids (ugly insects provide a pervasive visual motif) and too lifeless to enchant older audiences. Its as if Mr. Selick reached a brick wall on the way to feeling what his characters might feel and never found a way to punch through. DVD Focus Bob amp; Carol amp; Ted amp; Alice (1969) Theres no bloat in this relationship classic a first feature that Paul Mazursky directed from a script he wrote with Larry Tucker. The main targets of the loose buoyant satire are marriage inhibition and sexual freedom not to mention -- and its never specifically mentioned -- countercultural smugness. Bob and Carol played by Robert Culp and Natalie Wood spend a weekend of self-discovery at Northern Californias now-venerable Esalen Institute. Back in Los Angeles they preach the swingers gospel to their uptight friends Ted and Alice. Theyre played by Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon both of whom are sensational funny. All of Me (1984) It was bad enough watching Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin soldiering through ""The Pink Panther 2."" But it was worse remembering what glories theyd achieved in this romantic comedy directed by Carl Reiner. She plays Edwina a dying millionaire spinster who arranges to have her soul transplanted into the body of a beautiful young woman. He plays Roger an attorney whos supposed to revise her will. When she dies prematurely in the midst of great confusion something goes wrong and she ends up sharing Rogers body in a crazed kind of joint tenancy. Though the film is imperfect the physical comedy is often sublime. Corpse Bride (2005) This stop-motion animated feature directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson combines charming creepiness blithe necrophilia and unexpected sweetness; the films seems bathed in the milk of inhuman kindness. You know something special is going on when youre instantly smitten along with Johnny Depps Victorian bridegroom by a winsome blue-faced maggot-ridden bride who is not just anorexic but downright skeletal and irreversibly if seductively dead. (Shes voiced by Helena Bonham Carter.) Energy abounds in ""Corpse Bride"" but this singular little film also takes time to smell the wilted roses. Who knew that death could be so vital? --- Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Find related television listings at LocateTV.

In this image released by Columbia/Sony Pictures Steve Martin left and Jean Reno are shown in a scene from ""The Pink Panther 2."" Photo Peter Iovino AP Movie review The Pink Panther 2 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Pink Panther 2 Comedy. Starring Steve Martin Jean Reno Emily Mortimer and Andy Garcia. Directed by Harald Zwart. (PG. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) One can only hope that something good is coming from all the bad movies that Steve Martin has been appearing in. I keep waiting for Martin Robin Williams and Ice Cube to announce that theyve used all the proceeds from their unfunny comedies to cure cancer. (Or at least fund another halfway decent film like ""Shopgirl."") In the realm of bad Steve Martin movies ""The Pink Panther 2"" is about as good as it gets. The sequel doesnt offer much beyond relentless slapstick but the actor seems to be trying hard which cant be said for his ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" films. The crowd at the screening for critics burst into applause at the end and only a few appeared to be clapping because it was finally over. Martin who was trying too hard in his first ""Pink Panther"" movie seems more relaxed - doing less of a Peter Sellers imitation and bringing his own stylings into the role. The five writers credited to this movie contributed an average of one inspired sight gag each including a funny scene where Inspector Jacques Clouseaus bumbling is captured on a bank of security camera monitors. ""The Pink Panther 2"" begins with the theft of the Magna Carta the Shroud of Turin and other priceless relics. Clouseau leading an international ""dream team"" of inspectors tries to bumble his way into solving the case. Mindless pratfalls romantic misunderstandings and French people with British accents fill the screen until 92 minutes have passed and its time to validate your parking. Go ahead and bring the kids - all of the above is rated PG so the sexual innuendo violence and flatulence are kept to the bare minimum. The predictable script feels as if it were filmed right off the cocktail napkin it was jotted on but at least the movie has an ""Oceans 11"" sequels worth of good actors including Alfred Molina Jeremy Irons and Jean Reno. Both love interests for the 63-year-old Martin are in their mid-30s which is annoying and distracting - especially considering the wealth of beautiful talented actresses in their 40s and 50s.

Boss ""You fly to Kyoto in the morning."" Clouseau ""But I cant fly"" So goes one of the more . . . unexpected sequels of recent years. I thought that once you were injected with something small but horrible it meant you didnt have to deal with the disease again. Even with - lets count them - eight straight men and women of many nations standing around watching Steve Martins Clouseau mangle words there isnt a whole lot a movie can do when its best idea is to have its hero call a hamburger a "" amburguerre."" That achievement was anyway already recorded for posterity in the 2006 movie. Martin earned more laughs in his cameo in ""Baby Mama"" than he does here. A team of detectives from around the world gathers in Paris to help Clouseau find a thief called ""the Tornado"" who has stolen the huge diamond the movie is named after - plus the Shroud of Turin the Magna Carta and the Imperial Sword of Japan. The star investigators - a Brit (Alfred Molina) an Italian (Andy Garcia) who talks like Chico Marx a tech-y Japanese dude (Yuki Matsuzaki) and an Indian beauty (Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) - clutter up the background like mismatched throw pillows while Clouseau falls down a chimney or trips over crime-scene tape. Clouseaus reliably apoplectic boss Dreyfus is played this time by John Cleese stepping in for Kevin Kline who doesnt seem terribly busy these days but decided that staying home with Phoebe was a better move than re-upping with the pathetic pussycat. Instead of using a scene to gradually build absurdity the way Blake Edwards did director Harald Zwart (not a bad name for a comedy character but apparently this is an actual person a Norwegian with the comic flair of a boiled herring) and the screenwriters (Martin shares a story credit) disburse one vaguely comical-ish situation at a time then forget what to do with it. One (barely) amusing exception takes place at a country house in which the rest of the detectives watch on security cameras as Clouseau looks for clues but finds his inner Buster Keaton. More typically Heres Clouseau with his tiny lapels and his tiny hat getting into a tiny car barely bigger than his tiny mustache. So what happens? He takes his hands off the wheel obliging his partner (Jean Reno) to steer. End of scene When Clouseau infiltrates a restaurant dressed as a flamenco dancer/bullfighter the scene is so poorly cut that it removes any sense that his antics are getting crazier as he gets more desperate. Clouseau goes to the Vatican to interview the fellow he addresses as ""Mr. Pope."" (""Youre a very spiritual man"" Clouseau says in one of the better lines.) To re-enact a crime - the theft of the popes ring - Clouseau dresses up as the pontiff. Anyone looks funny as the pope but after Clouseau tumbles off the papal balcony and clings to a flagpole the scene saintpeters out. Lily Tomlin shows up and after Clouseau calls her a sexy woman (please - this is supposed to be comedy not sci-fi) it turns out her only role is political correctness enforcer. To the Japanese colleague Clouseau says ""I suppose you will be wanting sushi my little yellow friend"" a line that would have seemed too obvious a slur back when Peter Sellers was still alive. The main whodunit is about as complicated as the maze on the childrens place mat at your local Big Boy restaurant so the movie throws in a subplot about Clouseaus longing for his associate (Emily Mortimer) whom he loves ""like a brother. A hot sexy brother in a dress."" She is also being pursued by the suave Garcia character but Clouseau is so childlike that you sense he wouldnt know what came next after hugging. The movie hopes to be regarded as childlike too but theres a difference between kid-friendly and just regular old dumb. ""What is this key piece of evidence?"" Clouseau barks. The Garcia character holds up . . . a key. kyle.smithnypost.com THE PINK PANTHER 2 Flat cat. Running time 92 minutes. Rated PG (suggestive humor mild profanity).

(Peter Iovino) Joe Neumaier Thursday February 5 2009 243 PM Inspector Clouseau returns to track a new thief. With Steve Martin John Cleese. Director Harald Zwart. (131). PG Cartoon-style violence. At area theaters. So Inspector Jacques Clouseau of the French police has been turned into a childrens character. From this we can assume that those whod laugh at a bumbling seeely-speeeking Fronchmon are between 7 and 12 years old We can also deduce that that crowd enjoys slapstick that makes even the most ridiculous bits from the late Peter Sellers Clouseau oeuvre seem sublime Thus we can predict that a Clouseau film simply called ""The Pink Panther 2""-- when earlier sequels had monikers like ""Revenge of..."" or ""...Strikes Again""-- will not try very hard yet will appeal to families To be more precise everything around star Steve Martin who reinvigorated the ""Panther"" franchise three years ago is lazy in this 91-minute sequel directed by Harald Zwart (""Agent Cody Banks""). Because Martin is still as energized as he was decades ago when he was the jerk the man with two brains one of the Three Amigos and a dirty rotten scoundrel. As Clouseau Martin trips crashes and bashes his way through a tired script. None of it is memorable though the audience its aimed at will giggle at the adults gone goofy. As we catch up with Clouseau hes called back into action by his ever-exasperated chief Dreyfus (John Cleese not even attempting a French accent) when some of the worlds greatest treasures go missing including that fuchsia MacGuffin the Pink Panther diamond. Forced to join a detective dream team (Andy Garcias the Italian one and Alfred Molinas the English one) Clouseau exasperates everyone obliterates everything and finally saves the day. Emily Mortimer and Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are the requisite beauties while Jeremy Irons slums it as a master thief. The tweens wont know this but Blake Edwards original 1964 ""Pink Panther"" was a sophisticated bauble full of shifty charades and fireside seductions. In the middle of it was Sellerss Clouseau who could make a simple twitch of his moustache funny. In that film and its immediate successor ""A Shot in the Dark"" what made Clouseau hilarious was not that a door would hit him in the face -- it was the way he dealt with the door right afterward or approached it the next time. Only in the 70s sequels did he become childs fare. Martin starts at the outrageous accent and spins out from there and thats fine for this. And there are a few snicker-worthy scenes. But when Clouseau responds to an order to fly to Rome with ""but I cant fly""or a Pope-on-the-balcony joke has no payoff you wonder Is this really why the character was taken out of meuuthballs?

The skid mark that is ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" has scarcely been mopped up and now comes Steve Martins insufferably stupid ""Pink Panther 2"" ( out of four stars rated PG for some suggestive humor brief mild language and action). Recycling bins have fresher content than this listless exercise in check-the-boxes moviemaking. John Cleese taking over as Chief Inspector Dreyfus from Kevin Kline generates the films only sequence of genuine humor as Clouseaus invincible dumb luck drives him to a fit of head-banging apoplexy. Fifteen minutes into this fiasco and I knew exactly how he felt. The carefree wit of the Peter Sellers originals is lost here as every scene and performance strains for laughs. The brawling physical comedy is overstaged the supporting players mug shamelessly (especially Andy Garcia playing an Italian lothario who is a member of Clouseaus international detective team) and Martins tongue-twisting accent seems to have come from Pluto not Paris. Martin not only lacks Sellers physical comedy chops but he fluffs the joke rebounding from pratfalls with a beaming grin as if to say ""Hey did you catch that? Wasnt that funny?"" Worse he gives the character a coat of invulnerable smugness. That worked for Martins Wild and Crazy Guy an eon ago but its the wrong tone for this character. Emily Mortimer returns as Clouseaus prim love interest and her pinched expression suggests that she has taken her cue from Martins face-squinching. Also on board are returning sidekick Jean Reno Alfred Molina as a sleuth from Scotland Yard and a renowned English film star in an uncredited and overlong cameo. If you buy a ticket for this one mon ami le joke is on you.

Steve Martin reprises his role as Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther 2. Photo Sony Pictures The Pink Panther 2 1 / 1 Back to Gallery France can take it. France can always take it -- whatever silliness the world is apt to dish out whether its freedom fries or franco-bashing. After 46 years of putting up with the klutzy Inspector Jacques Clouseau and his stupid accent French audiences will likely roll their eyes at The Pink Panther 2and calmly return to their cheese plates. American audiences are advised to do the same. The Pink Panther series was never about France anyway. At the very beginning it was supposed to be about David Niven in a smoking jacket but audiences didnt care much for his character and latched onto Clouseau instead. After that Blake Edwards joyously nonsensical comedies became vehicles for the man beneath the mustache Peter Sellers. At their peak they exploited Sellers gift for well-timed pomposity and just let him rip turning the best scenes into artfully paced ballets of slapstick absurdism. The idiot detective believed himself to be smart and smooth and canny; most of the comedy rose from this self-delusion and the fact that almost everyone else regarded him as a dunce of the lowest order. Half the fun was watching their reaction shots as Sellers inevitably -- with an almost Zen-like calm -- broke stuff mangled stuff and screwed stuff up. There is nothing inevitable or Zen about The Pink Panther 2. It offers pratfalls and mayhem and lots of energetic pinch-mouthed mugging on the part of its star Steve Martin who also stares down his nose and walks with a little mincing wiggle. For all that effort I only laughed hard twice once at the beginning when the besieged Chief Inspector Dreyfus (John Cleese) learns that Clouseaus been tapped to lead a ""dream team"" of international detectives and removes to the bathroom for a cathartic head-bash; and once later on when Clouseau dresses in papal robes and dangles off a balcony in Vatican City. The story true to form revolves around the theft of the famed Pink Panther diamond which has been lost more times in more movies than Al Pacinos temper. In this latest go-round a few additional items have been stolen as well the Magna Carta the Shroud of Turin and the Imperial Sword of Japan. Enter the dream team of gumshoes who include Alfred Molina as a vain Brit Andy Garcia as an oh-so-suave Italian (is it me or does he spend half his life in cravats?) and Yuki Matsuzaki as a techno-savvy Japanese. Arriving late is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan as the flirty author of a book on the Tornado a legendary thief and the cases chief suspect. Directed by Harald Zwat (Agent Cody Banks) from a screenplay by Martin Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber The Pink Panther 2 is blander busier and less amusing than the first Martin reboot 2006s The Pink Panther. Not coincidentally its also a brazen rip-off of 1975s The Return of the Pink Panther -- if youve seen that one youll know where this ones headed. Even if you havent seen that one youll know where this ones headed. But for all the obvious cribbing the filmmakers still seem ill-at-ease with Clouseaus simplistic world view and frank buffoonery. He remains a sexist-racist-egotistical nincompoop but his sexism and racism are corrected with sensitivity training (by Lily Tomlin sad to say) and his egotism is fanned by adoring sidekicks (Jean Reno and Emily Mortimer reprising their roles). Even worse they have cause to adore him Hes a simply ingenious detective. Forgive me but I dont get this new Clouseau. The beauty of the guy has always been his gift for falling upward solving cases despite his blindered tendency to trash crime scenes and people with lordly dignity. In Pink 2 he gets the trashing part right but hes far too clever and twitchy and far less memorable as a result. He bumbles toward nothing but irrelevancy. And you just might forget him before its over. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

The Pink Panther is 45 years old now with a bigscreen life only two years shorter than James Bonds and a lesson of both series is dont underestimate the power of a catchy musical theme and memorable opening credits. In the case of ""The Pink Panther 2"" the ""2"" of which is used advisedly in that this is actually the 10th Inspector Clouseau feature the enduring inspirations of the late composer Henry Mancini and animators Friz Freleng and David DePatie provide more consistent enjoyment than the miss-but-sometimes-hit merriment generated by the living participants. But like Steve Martins first outing in the role three years ago which generated a 158 million worldwide gross ""2"" serves up enough goofy pranks and fractured wordplay to keep the series purring along. While hardly supplanting Peter Sellers in anyones memories Martin proved a more than serviceable Clouseau in his first go-round in the role in 2006 mangling pronunciations with particular aplomb -- his memorable tussle with ""hamburger"" gets a replay here -- and performing clever variations on old Sellers-Blake Edwards routines. Theres more of the same this time around A new take on the classic finger-on-the-spinning-globe gag is funny and Martins back-and-forth with Andy Garcia over the pronunciation of the endless name of the latters Italian character provokes the most sustained laughs in the picture. Script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who penned the recent Sundance hit ""500 Days of Summer"" and Martin follows the time-tested blueprint Clouseau is called out of parking-violations department banishment to join a dream team of world detectives to track down the Tornado who thus far has stolen the Magna Carta the Shroud of Turin and the Imperial Sword of Japan. Mix of Garcias Italian Alfred Molinas Brit Yuki Matsuzakis Japanese and Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchans Indian creates a veritable bumper-car ride of accents with Jean Reno as Clouseaus partner and Emily Mortimer as the detectives adorably prim associate and secret love tossing in their own French inflections for good measure. Thwarted when Clouseaus suspicions that the Tornado is a haughty grandee (Jeremy Irons) prove false the group is stunned when the pope no less is divested of his irreplaceable ring in the Vatican. Amusing silliness ensues when Clouseau dons papal vestments and becomes mistaken for the Holy Father by the crowds at St. Peters but the detectives impersonation of a flamenco dancer falls flat evidence that Martin needs a director more adept at staging and timing physical comedy than the Dutch-born Norway-based helmer Harald Zwart -- who to paraphrase Clouseau is a director to remember for a film that must be forgotten ""Agent Cody Banks."" Producer Robert Simonds commendably follows the guidelines Edwards set early in the ""Panther"" series but then dropped surrounding Clouseau with adept sexy co-stars. Even when not much is going on its agreeable enough to observe the likes of Mortimer Irons Garcia Bachchan Molina Reno Matsuzaki and John Cleese get up to their little mischief. Lily Tomlin assumes the inspired new character of a political-correctness watchdog at police headquarters who keeps catching Clouseau at wayward moments. But after a promising start it partly may be the resurgent series slide toward juvenility and direct aim at subteen audiences that robs Tomlins role of its potential as Clouseau is prevented from doing or saying much that is truly outrageous to provoke the womans schoolmarmish wrath. Paris and assorted other Euro locations add welcome flavor although production values are pretty basic.

Martins innocently inept French detective has invited his secretary Nicole (a French-accented Emily Mortimer) out for a romantic dinner. Insisting on choosing his own wine Clouseau heads to the restaurants rack of vintage bottles plucks one then another until the shelf teeters and the bottles start to fly. Like the star of a classic silent-era comedy Martin becomes the balletic nincompoop - juggling a dizzying deluge of pricey wines trying to keep the bottles from smashing to the floor. Its terrific physical comedy - funny deft visually alive. Alas the scene is like an oasis in the desert of knuckleheadedness that is The Pink Panther 2. Inspired by the Blake Edwards films with a new animated opening-credits sequence and that familiar Henry Mancini theme PP2 begins with the thefts of some famous objets the Magna Carta the Shroud of Turin Japans Imperial Sword and Frances ""Pink Panther"" diamond - all lifted by someone who leaves a calling card The Tornado. An international team of super-sleuths is assembled to solve the case an Italian detective (Andy Garcia) a Brit (Alfred Molina) a Japanese (Yuki Matsuzaki) and a Frenchman - oui Clouseau. John Cleese replaces Kevin Kline as Clouseaus flustered superior Dreyfuss (Cleese does one bit of Basil Fawlty-esque headbanging) and the beautiful Aishwarya Rai is onboard as a jewelry expert recruited to help look for the absconded jewel. Although comic mayhem follows Martins Clouseau everywhere as he wreaks havoc at the Vatican sets a restaurant ablaze and causes traffic nightmares as he steers his Smart car through Paris none of it is particularly funny. Martin and Molina have one jolly scene of nonsensical insult-hurling Jeremy Irons makes an appearance as a snooty suspect and Jean Reno and Mortimer reprise their respective roles from Martins first (2006) Pink Panther redo. The director is Harald Zwart a Norwegian-gone-Hollywood whose resume includes Frankie Munoz and Hilary Duffs Agent Cody Banks and who has reportedly been assigned the task of remaking The Karate Kid. The director seems to be aiming for the same age demographics with The Pink Panther 2. Thats about the level of humor subteen.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

I mean not counting me of course. Im a critic. I get paid not to laugh.Fake popes are funny. At least judging by the generous audience reaction to a recent screening of ""The Pink Panther 2"" they are. Several fans of Martin reprising his role as the bumbling French detective Jacques Clouseau in this sequel to the 2006 update of the old Peter Sellers comedies tittered and guffawed when Clouseau investigating the theft of the pontiffs ring donned the Holy Fathers robes to reenact the crime. He wound up swinging wildly in the air over the heads of the crowd in St. Peters Square. I mean come on thats hilarious.Isnt it?Okay maybe one could expect a little bit more. Especially from a film that co-stars Jeremy Irons Emily Mortimer Andy Garcia Alfred Molina and Lily Tomlin. Yes you read that correctly. Each of those blue-chip performers is criminally wasted in the movie which plays like a series of disconnected hit-or-miss skits in a cut-rate ""Saturday Night Live."" Even Martins talents as a physical comedian are underused except for a wonderful set piece early in the film where his character gets to juggle a cascade of bottles as they fall from a teetering wine rack.Sure its dumb humor. But its also at times mean. Clouseau calls one of his fellow detectives a Japanese computer whiz played by Yuki Matsuzaki (""Letters From Iwo Jima"") ""my little yellow friend."" I know were not meant to laugh at the victim but at Clouseaus bigotry which is supposed to be just another example of his comic ineptitude.My only question is this In the context of these by-the-book pratfalls is it funny enough?-- Michael OSullivan (Feb. 6 2009)Contains slapstick violence and brief suggestive humor.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The notion of anyone taking over the part of Inspector Jacques Clouseau--Peter Sellers signature role in a series of broad beloved Blake Edwards-directed detective farces--belongs in a file filled with bad ideas. (Perhaps it could nestle between Indiana Jones-meets-aliens and ""Lets let Kevin Costner make another post-apocalyptic epic."") Still while the 2006 reboot The Pink Panther had little to recommend it star Steve Martin was never the problem; he used the role as an excuse to unlock a gift for silly voices and buffoonery kept in the vault by movies like Cheaper By The Dozen. Though his performance wasnt worlds apart from Sellers he memorably defined his Clouseau as a supremely self-confident idiot oblivious to the chaos he created and he rode that idea through every weak gag the movie threw his way between a few cute bits with Emily Mortimer as his lovestruck assistant. The Pink Panther 2 plays like an undeserved victory lap for a series that only limped to the finish line the last time. It sets up false hope by getting its one big laugh out of the way in the opening scene as John Cleese subbing in for Kevin Kline as Martins bedeviled boss takes his frustration to a masochistic extreme. Sophisticated comedy it isnt but at least Cleese like Martin appears to be trying. The same cant be said of the movie around them which sluggishly proceeds through a plot about a master thief named The Tornado and the international-box-office-friendly team of detectives (whose ranks include Andy Garcia Alfred Molina and Aishwarya Rai) charged with getting to the bottom of the crimes. This apparently requires a lot of scenes in which most everyone stands around to make room for artlessly filmed breathlessly executed bits of physical comedy from Martin who labors hard to little reward. An extended scene in which Martin roughhouses with some children suggests the sequels true audience although kids will likely be baffled by a running gag in which Lily Tomlin pops up to instruct Martin in the politically correct ways of the modern workplace.

"Martin in Clouseau redux falls flat in Pink Panther 2 - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW The Pink Panther 2 Martin in Clouseau redux falls flat Steve Martin as the bumbling inspector in Pink Panther 2. (Peter Iovino/Columbia/Sony Pictures via AP) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / February 6 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + In ""The Pink Panther 2"" Steve Martin garbles his way through another turn as the moronic Inspector Jacques Clouseau. I would say the reprise is ill-advised but the first outing made a lot of people a lot of money. And idiot peacekeepers are hot again. Before Paul Blart there was Clouseau. So rather than making too much out of how terrible the second helping of Clouseau is (quite actually) in the spirit of generosity Ill take a moment to note that this excruciating excuse for entertainment contains a few painkillers.Take Andy Garcia. He plays the Italian member of the ""international dream team"" of detectives in pursuit of a stolen diamond and every time he delivered his characters name - something like Vicenzo Ricotta Yada Yada Brancaleone - my migraine went away. As work his job is thankless but he does it like a professional. Its not condescension I detect as he trudges from one set to the next its something approximating enjoyment.Sadly his pleasure isnt contagious. My head appreciated him more than my heart ever did. The same is true for everybody who shows up to work alongside or across from Martin - a tan trim Jean Reno Alfred Molina (using his English accent for a change) Emily Mortimer (not using hers) John Cleese Lily Tomlin Johnny Hallyday Jeremy Irons. Theyre far from wax versions of themselves but this is still a movie that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through.Martin whos scarily ageless appears to be having a ball. He tries on a mint-green matador costume and attempts to tango. He dangles two obnoxious French children over a balcony. He manages not to crack up while plying the pope (Eugene Lazarev) with insults. He uses that bad French accent with the grace of someone handling a bazooka. Paying customers may find his enthusiasm heartening but Martin works so hard that all you see after a while is the work. Thats true of all the actors. The same couldnt be said of the cast of the original ""Pink Panthers"" including Peter Sellers as Clouseau.Even at their gassiest those movies at least had a director in Blake Edwards. At no point in ""Pink Panther 2"" does credible screenwriting or apparent direction allow for the sensation of spontaneity. Everyone is free to talk over everyone else or as Irons does pretend theyre not even there. Aishwarya Rai doesnt appear to know what film shes in. The Indian superstar - working now as Aishwarya Rai Bachchan - plays a criminologist who constantly looks like shes wandered in from one of Rais LOreal ads. Her function here is window dressing. She makes even less sense here than Beyonce who was Zee Sexy Ladee in the first movie. But all these international names ensure the brands global domination.A decent commercial movie tries to build on its scenes. The scenes in ""The Pink Panther 2"" seem arranged by a SaladShooter. Most of them are pointless. My own personal fantasies aside why does Renos character move himself (and two little sons) into Clouseaus apartment? Why do the sons attack him with their karate? Why has their assault been shot and edited like a remedial sequence from ""The Monkees""?That Clouseaus idiocy vexes just about everybody should be funny. Its hard however to get past the movies idiocy. Playing Clouseaus exasperated boss Cleese rams his head into a wall minutes into the action. Thats a powerful image insofar as his headache was mine.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

"The Pink Panther 2 stars Steve Martin Jean Reno Emily Mortimer - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Pink Panther 2 stars Steve Martin Jean Reno Emily Mortimer Michael PhillipsTribune critic Ten things I can tell you after seeing ""The Pink Panther 2""1. Nothing is harder and more elusive than successful slapstick onscreen. Nothing. 2. Theres a reason ""The Pink Panther"" and ""A Shot in the Dark"" hold up. Those were the first two films featuring the peerlessly confident dolt Inspector Clouseau as played by Peter Sellers and directed by Blake Edwards. The gags came in all sizes but they rarely left character in the dust.3. Why did the later Sellers/Edwards Clouseau pictures get to be such a drag? Because Edwards started confusing bigger and more destructive with funnier. What do you remember more fondly? Sellers wreaking elegant havoc at the billiards table? Or years later the exhausting Herbert Lom trying to incinerate his nemesis with a doomsday machine? 4. The funniest bit in the strained 2006 ""Pink Panther"" remake starring Steve Martin was verbal slapstick as opposed to physical. Im speaking of the English lesson in which Martins Clouseau tries to learn the phrase ""I would like to buy a hamburger."" Martin is hilarious with this sort of mangle-mouthed routine. Hes also a formidable physical comedian and now that hes in his early 60s (Sellers was in his late 30s when he made the original ""Pink Panther"" and ""A Shot in the Dark"" also known as ""the good ones"") you dont want to see him--or just as often Martins double--getting thrown through walls or onto coffee tables. You want to see what he can do not what he cant.5. In ""The Pink Panther 2"" the cast sprints way way out ahead of the material and miles ahead of the director Harald Zwart. I enjoyed Emily Mortimer back as Nicole Clouseaus soul mate. Andy Garcia (as a rakish Italian sleuth) has a funny bit with a mirror involving Jeremy Irons who looks vaguely distressed at finding himself in a disposable ""Pink Panther"" sequel.6. The vibe of ""PP2"" is more consciously 60s than Martins earlier Clouseau adventure. The ensemble includes a returning Jean Reno as Clouseaus right-hand man and John Cleese replacing Kevin Kline as Inspector Dreyfus who has mysteriously morphed from French to English.7. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan portrays an expert on the subject of the suspected diamond thief who steals the Panther along with the Shroud of Turin and the popes ring. Shes not what youd call unsightly. She is in fact what youd call ""sightly."" This is all the movie asks of her. 8. Heres the big problem with ""PP2"" Most of it even the routine stuff would work twice as well if director Zwart and editor Julia Wong eased up and allowed the performers to interact--to do their thing in medium shot without a lot of pushy close-ups and overemphasis so that their bodies might inform what their faces are up to.9. When Martin shares a scene with Lily Tomlin his ""All of Me"" cohort (she plays a political-correctness counselor appalled at Clouseaus casual clueless prejudices) you have to smile partly because they snag some laughs from unpromising setups and partly because youre remembering back to the dance they did together at the end of ""All of Me.""10. Not many performers can earn a fair-size laugh by pronouncing ""island"" as ""izz-land."" Martin is one of them.Click here to see the Chicago Tribunes full movie report.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG (for some suggestive humor brief mild language and action).Running time 132.Opening Feb. 6.Starring Steve Martin (Inspector Clouseau); Jean Reno (Ponton); Emily Mortimer (Nicole); Andy Garcia (Vicenzo); Alfred Molina (Pepperidge); John Cleese (Dreyfus); Lily Tomlin (Mrs. Berenger); Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (Sonia); Yuki Matsuzaki (Kenji).Directed by Harald Zwart; written by Scott Neustadter Michael H.

Living in a remote tiny village in the hinterlands between Europe and Asia Aya (Kristyna Maleova) and Temelko (Maximilian Mauff) long to consummate their relationship but vow to wait until a date suggested by Ayas astrologist grandmother -- four years in the future. When the day comes though Absurdistans desert community is suffering from a drought brought on by a decaying irrigation pipe which the communitys lazy male population refuses to fix. So Aya organizes a female sex strike until the menfolk remedy the situation. The resulting gender war and Temelkos attempts to bring water to Absurdistan are decidedly low-stakes affairs but director Veit Helmer (Tuvalu) is more interested in crafting a gently amusing modern-day folktale in which the happy ending is assured from the first moment Aya and Temelko beam at one another. As demonstrated by the films low-grade special effects Absurdistan makes a virtue out of modest handmade storytelling without falling prey to cutesy self-indulgence and Helmer gets astounding comic mileage out of the loutish stupidity of the villages very hairy men. (Nuart) (Tim Grierson)BLESSED IS THE MATCH THE LIFE AND DEATH OF HANNAH SENESH Hannah Senesh the ardent young socialist-Zionist who emigrated from Budapest to Palestine and was tortured and killed by the Nazis for parachuting into Hungary to stimulate Jewish resistance has become such a sainted Joan of Arc to Israelis that its a relief to watch her scaled down into a flawed woman (of enormous bravery) here. Based on a memoir by Seneshs mother Roberta Grossmans film is an ungainly hybrid of straight-up documentary and ingenuous re-enactment. Grossman smartly shifts the focus from the parachutists derring-do to the bizarre sequence of events by which held in the same prison Senesh and her mother managed to communicate with one another and buoy the spirits of other prisoners. Senesh had a soulful side -- she wrote the poem ""Eli Eli"" which became the famous Holocaust song -- but like many people of outstanding public courage she was less adept at private life. To her regret she never had a lover and one of her surviving fellow partisans frankly admits that he found more in her to admire than to like. Seneshs fortitude and her intransigent refusal to beg for her life at the end raise complicated questions about heroism as Anglo-Jewish historian Martin Gilbert underscores when he asks what counts as failure in the context of the Holocaust. (Music Hall; Town Center 5) (Ella Taylor)CHOCOLATE The world may not have needed a Thai-language martial arts hybrid of Kill Bill and Rain Man but by God it has one now. Already chopped into countless snippets and strewn across YouTube director Prachya Pinkaews followup to the mighty Muay Thai epics Ong-Bak and The Protector offers more of everything more score-settling for the Wests Asian-action culture thievery; more maudlin interludes; and more knees fists and elbows to the skull than the oeuvres of Bruce Lee and Vince McMahon combined. In place of his former leading man Tony Jaa Pinkaew offers instant action-hero JeeJa Yanin as an autistic girl who instinctively apes the fights she sees in movies and video games. When her ex-moll mom develops cancer the girl goes collecting on old debts to pay for her treatment -- and if you can stop goggling at the tasteless premise the formula of a slight scrawny chick pulverizing brawny thugs never loses its fist-pumping appeal. Though the plot just lets Pinkaew restage the same fight over and over on different sets let it also be said that they get bigger and better each time -- culminating in a neck-snapping head-busting leg-twisting gravity-defying free-for-all played out on ledges high above a city street. This is backyard wrestling as cinema and you can judge for yourself if thats a recommendation or a warning. (Memo to Magnolia Pictures genre-movie subsidiary Magnet which also put out the excellent Swedish vampire movie Let the Right One In More please.) (Citywide) (Jim Ridley)MADE IN AMERICA Why is there so much violence in South L.A.? What are the historical roots of the Bloods and Crips? Stacy Peraltas documentary Made in America employs hip-hop beats and music-video aesthetics (quick edits slick cinematography artful use of still photography) to answer those twined questions. With narration by Forest Whitaker Peralta (Dogtown and Z-Boys Riding Giants) turns his cameras on former and current gang members who outline the origins of gangs (one starting point the once-racist policies of the Boy Scouts which forced young black males to form makeshift youth groups of their own) the evolution of the gangs their role in the civil-rights movement of the 60s and the American governments hand in turning Bloods and Crips from community activists into community scourge. Its a lot to take in and Peralta does an admirable job cramming tons of history and insight into his reportage on how the ""hood"" came to be. Made in America is fueled by his palpable frustration and unapologetic lefty sympathizing which is the films strength. Its failure to really address the role of economic policies and job loss is a glaring weakness however underscoring not only a crucial information deficit but also Peraltas real-life remove from his own subject matter. Those unfamiliar with the subject matter should use Made in America as the gateway film to check out the superior All Power to the People and Bastards of the Party. The latter directed by former Blood Cle ""Bone"" Sloan is the raw underground joint to Peraltas pop opus. (Sunset 5) (Ernest Hardy) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm FANBOYS This dust-gatherer about four friends traveling cross country in 1998 to sneak a peek at a rough cut of Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace is meant for the dude content to simply stare at an Imperial storm troopers empty helmet for 90 minutes. Its for the two childhood friends who parted ways back in junior high over a dispute about whether Captain James T. Kirk could kick Han Solos ass. And its for every girl who ever donned a Princess Leia Jabbas palace slave-girl costume lest her boyfriend refuse her access to the Dianoga under his robe. (And yes its for everyone who knows that a Dianoga is the tentacled one-eyed creature living in the Death Stars garbage masher. Just ask my 5-year-old.) So theres your target audience -- Kevin Smith in other words who cameos as himself in a film loaded with more what-the? guests than an entire season of The Love Boat. The rest of you find something -- anything -- better to do. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)LUCK BY CHANCE Farhan Akhtar the talented young director (Dil Chahta Hai) turned leading man (Rock On) may simply be too nice a guy (and lack the dramatic chops) to effectively play the boyish wannabe actor with a cold conniving soul at the center of his sister Zoya Akhtars Luck By Chance an enjoyable but ultimately toothless inside-Bollywood dramady. Key sequences in which Akhtars Vikram Jaisingh reveals the unsuspected depth of his self-serving amorality dont send the intended chill up the spine because theres nothing slithering beneath the surface of Akhtars blandly likable performance. (Konkona Sen Sharma as the devoted aspiring actress Vikram repeatedly betrays quietly acts this amateur under the table.) Like quite a few finger-wagging movies about moviemaking Luck By Chance doesnt have the budget to capture the full cheesy splendor of the blockbuster film shoots it disapproves of. But the Akhtar siblings who co-wrote the script are lifelong Hindi cinema insiders (their dad is legendary Sholay screenwriter and ubiquitous film-song lyricist Javed Akhtar) and their levelheaded sense of the way the business operates keeps things grounded. A sharply observed subplot about the near collapse and frantic resurrection of a major Bollywood production feels like frontline reporting rather than satire. Better yet the Akhtars have created a half-dozen sharp supporting roles and handed them to practiced actors whose relish for the job keeps the movie jumping. Longtime Bollywood favorite Rishi Kapoor as a flop-sweat producer in love with his own flamboyance and his 1973 Bobby co-star Dimple Kapadia as a diva actress turned stage mother are amazingly good at snapping one-liners back and forth in long-drawn-out volleys that would not be out of place at Wimbledon. (Culver Plaza; Fallbrook 7; Naz 8; Norwalk 8; Laguna 16) (David Chute)THE PINK PANTHER 2 There are maybe two or three laugh-out-loud moments and a handful of chuckles to be culled from Steve Martins overlong Pink Panther 2 the latest installment in the lackluster overhaul of Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers iconic comedy franchise. Thats as good as it gets. After several of the worlds most important cultural artifacts are stolen Inspector Clouseau (a lifelessly mugging Martin) is drafted to head up a whos-who of the worlds leading detectives to track down the culprit. Until that storied team comes together the film is a dreary checklist of pratfalls wan double entendres and frantic unfunny set pieces. Jolts of inspiration briefly appear in the forms of a dick-waving Andy Garcia and a verbally jousting Alfred Molina (each playing a detective) and Lily Tomlin as a counselor trying to turn the casually racist and sexist Clouseau into a model of political correctness. The rest of the cast (Emily Mortimer Jeremy Irons a disarmingly beautiful Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) is fine but its Garcia Molina and Tomlin who give you momentary hope that the film might settle into a witty irreverent romp. Unfortunately their efforts are ultimately defeated by Harald Zwarts inert direction of a flat script. And youll have no problem figuring out the villain long before the film ends. (Citywide) (Ernest Hardy) PUSH Not to be mistaken for the acclaimed MoNique Sundance drama director Paul McGuigans harebrained sci-fi thriller about young Americans with extraordinary psychic powers banding together in Hong Kong seems to have been made up as it was being filmed. Its less X-Men and more ""Why man?"" Hero 1 Chris Evans is a second-generation ""mover"" with telekinetic abilities; government baddie and ""pusher"" Djimon Hounsou plants treacherous ideas in other peoples minds; a smugly precocious Dakota Fanning sketches pictures of the future as a ""watcher""; and everyone else sounds like the drug nicknames Hunter S. Thompson came up with in his Las Vegas suitcase ""stitches"" ""shadows"" ""bleeders"" ""shifts"" ""sniffs"" and ""wipers."" All that the superskills offer are ridiculous screenwriting shortcuts (Evans hands out instruction cards to his posse then has his mind erased by a crusty Chinese local in order to thwart telepathic villains and literally change fate) for a puffed-up plot that would make less sense to explain than to watch. The CGI effects are serviceable if thats your bag but the action has no suspense the set pieces are uninspired (besides all the neon why are they even in Hong Kong?) and the half-baked anticlimactic punchline had me expecting an announcement that Season One kicks off on Fox this fall. (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis)THE 2008 ACADEMY AWARD-NOMINATED SHORTS Those who have never attended the annual festival of Oscar-nominated live-action and animated shorts should be advised Dont expect all 10 entries to be mini-masterpieces. Nonetheless theres some lovely artistry to be found. The live-action selections largely reject tight narrative to engage in meditations on guilt cultural differences and aging. The closest these films come to a page-turner is On the Line a twisty drama concerning a tentative friendship between a German security guard and a pretty bookstore employee. By comparison New Boy is a small shrug of a film tracing the touchy-feely misadventures of an African boy enduring his first day in an Irish school. Cynical Oscar handicappers will note that the familiar Toyland is the sole short set during the Holocaust but the film manages to find some poignancy in a Gentile mothers search for her missing child in Nazi Germany. The biggest missed opportunity is The Pig an initially intriguing Danish deadpan comedy about an older mans odd attachment to a painting of a pig. The clear winner is Manon on the Asphalt a moving rumination that turns a young womans serious bike accident into an existential discussion on the fragility of connection. The animation nominees are a battle between the deeply personal and the playfully freewheeling. Somewhere in the middle is This Way Up a soulful British comedy about a father-and-son undertaker team who brave boulders rivers and Satan to get their assigned casket to the cemetery on time. Oktapodi is a forgettable Pixar-like adventure yarn about one determined octopus quest to save its true love from becoming dinner; actual Pixars Presto is dazzlingly animated but its nimble craftsmanship lacks the heart of the final two nominees. The minimalist Russian Lavatory-Lovestory looks like a New Yorker cartoon its fable about a lovelorn bathroom attendant is satisfying romantic goo. Finally theres Japans La Maison en petits cubes which follows an aging man whose towering house is being consumed by a flood forcing him to enter the submerged floors and confront the memories held within them. A heartbreaking treatise on the inescapable clutter of life this film is one of the most modest in this entire series but in terms of emotional resonance its among the best.

Columbia/Sony Pictures Feb. 6. The Pink Panther 2 Steve Martin reprises his role of bumbling French police detective Inspector Jacques Clouseau as he tracks down the stolen Pink Panther diamond. Columbia/Sony Pictures Feb. 6. (Peter Iovino / Sony Pictures) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Someday well stroll through the Steve Martin Wing of The Los Angeles County Museum of Art admiring his collection and well appreciate what he had to do to pay for his Picassos Seurats and Edward Hoppers.Until then we endure the Cheaper by the Dozens and Pink Panthers with a grimace remembering the comic he once was. The Pink Panther 2 his latest is somewhat less of a desecration of the memory of Peter Sellers than Martins first outing as the bumbling French detective. Martin still hasnt bothered to learn a faux French accent. The editing doesnt hide that even the simplest stunts are now done by fellows in snow-white wigs. But this family-friendly farce plays lighter than the first Martin Panther even if Martin himself still doesnt ""get"" what made the character funny.The Magna Carta the Shroud of Turin and a famous Japanese sword have been stolen by The Tornado. An international ""dream team"" -- English (Alfred Molina) Italian (Andy Garcia actually funny) Japanese (Yuki Matsuzaki) and Indian (Aishwarya Rai) -- has been assembled to crack the case. They want the worlds ""greatest detective"" on board. Can his boss (John Cleese giving his all) spare Clouseau from parking duty? Of course he can even though he knows the only smart thing about the man is his Smart Car. No sooner than Clouseau and Ponton (Jean Reno) are on the case than the Pink Panther diamond is stolen -- again.Our team travels to Rome to interview a suspect (an Oscar winner in a cameo) and the popes ring is swiped right off his finger. Not to worry. Clouseaus powers of deduction -- if not his tact or common sense -- will triumph.""Forgeeve me Meester Pope"" Martin-Clouseau purrs in an accent that comes and goes as if he forgets how Pepe LePew sounded. To his new Japanese dream teammate he blurts ""I suppose you weel be wanting soooshi my leetle yellow friend.""Lily Tomlin is among those who took this paid French vacation playing a human-resources officer trying to cure Clouseau of his political incorrectness. Emily Mortimer is back as the assistant Clouseau pines for. A few bits of physical comedy pay off. Martins juggling skills come in handy for a (special effects-assisted) accident with a wine rack. He dances a flamenco (badly) and has a karate brawl with Pontons young sons.Dutch director Harald Zwart (Agent Cody Banks) gets less out of his star than his stuntmen. The film treats Clouseau at times as a cartoon character hurling him across the French skyline. Neither actor nor director pick up on what made the character work -- he was an egomaniac who suspected his incompetence but was determined to keep up appearances. Martin lacks Sellers dash his pained ""Ill be found out"" double-takes his mastery of the accent. Martin isnt putting the work into it.But these Panther paydays may pay off yet. A Picasso for a Pink -- thats the best we can hope for.

He artfully gibberizes words like hamburger sniggers at his own deductive elan and does slapstick battle with everything from wine bottles to the Popes miter. Martin though is so respectful of the role that he doesnt really make it his own; he does warmed-over Sellers instead of blissed-out Martin. When a series of world artifacts disappears Clouseau is placed in charge of a dream team of detectives (Andy Garcia Alfred Molina etc.) which gives him too many straight men. The Pink Panther 2 provides genial chuckles but its never excitingly rude.

He is a brilliant comedian a thoughtful essayist an expert banjo player a talented actor. And the star and co-writer of The Pink Panther 2. Why? Granted everyone has bills to pay especially these days and Martin has a world-class art collection and whatnot to maintain. And part of his shtick has long included playing someone who isnt quite in on the joke. Its funny in small doses. Enduring it for an entire movie is too much to ask of even loyal fans. Enduring it for two movies? Thats cruel and unusual. Yet heres Martin back again as Jacques Clouseau the bumbling French detective immortalized in his original incarnation by Peter Sellers in a really stupid movie. But its willfully stupid. Guess there are points for that. This time around someone is stealing priceless objects - the Magna Carta the Shroud of Turin the popes ring that kind of thing. So far the Pink Panther diamond Frances pride and joy is safe but . . . oops. Got that too. An international ""dream team"" of investigators is assembled to catch the thief and somehow Clouseau currently on traffic-cop duty is Frances contribution. He joins Pepperidge (Alfred Molina) Vicenzo (Andy Garcia) and Kenji (Yuki Matsuzaki) ostensibly to add his expertise. Of course he cripples them with his idiocy instead. There are a few sort-of funny gags and one laugh-out-loud moment courtesy of John Cleese as Clouseaus long-suffering boss Chief Inspector Dreyfus. There is a romantic triangle after a fashion as Clouseau tries to hide his feelings for Nicole (Emily Mortimer) from the world and Vicenzo makes a move on her. Meanwhile Sonia (Aishwarya Rai) a beautiful woman who just happens to be an expert on the suspected thief seems interested in Clouseau. Floating around in all of this somewhere are Jeremy Irons as a shady art trader and Lily Tomlin as a human-resources type riding herd on police employees who act inappropriately. Hmm. Wonder if the department has any? And loyal Ponton (Jean Reno) is back helping Clouseau while weathering domestic problems. Martin is such a likable personality its tempting to say he makes the movie worthwhile. Sorry thats too tall an order for anyone. But if he doesnt give us someone to laugh at when hes making Pink Panther movies he at least gives us someone to feel sorry for.
