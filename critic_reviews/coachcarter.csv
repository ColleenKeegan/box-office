Comments Coach Carter Ken Carter a high school basketball coach in working-class Richmond California made national headlines in January 1999 when he benched his entire team (then undefeated) in midseason because some players grades were too poor. This dramatization of his story consistently takes the high road stressing education over sports and responsibility over despair and Samuel L. Jackson is good as the straightforward maddeningly stubborn coach who gets more static from the parents than the players. But screenwriters Mark Schwahn and John Gatins continually compromise the storys real-world bite by recycling scenes and situations from other coach-team weepies (Hoosiers et al) and teacher-student inspirationals (Stand and Deliver et al). This is supposed to be about setting high standards yet its full of fudged ultimatums; in the end I couldnt be sure whether its morality was complex or just confused.

When the players failed Carter made national news by cancelling games and locking the gym. This is the MTV version of his story; all fast cuts and thumping rap as the initially outraged team eventually rise to Carters challenge. Samuel L Jackson is his usual commanding self in the lead role although his seemingly endless array of shouty speeches about attitude and commitment begin to grate after two hours. Equally although this is an inspirational genre pic that pushes all the requisite buttons throughout you cant help but feel that rather than benching the team director Thomas Carter should have benched a few of those ham-fisted sporting cliches instead.

Jackson coolly tackles the title role in ""Coach Carter"" a slick fun biopic about a former hoops star who transforms a bunch of high school neer-do-wells from boys to men. Morgan Freeman used a Louisville Slugger to scare straight the students in ""Lean on Me."" Michelle Pfeiffer donned a leather jacket and busted out some goofy kung fu to prove to a class of ruffians that she was down with them in ""Dangerous Minds."" And Edward James Olmos mixed Jedi mind tricks into his pedagogy in ""Stand and Deliver."" Samuel L. Jackson enforces strict rules as high school coach Ken Carter who benched his undefeated team when some players shirked their academic responsibilities. (Sam Urdank -- Paramount Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Coach Carter National Showtimes  Watch the Trailer  Movie Trailer Library  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now In the MTV-produced ""Coach Carter"" which is admittedly just as predictable as those aforementioned feel-gooders about a steely outsider bucking the system for the good of the youth Jackson needs nothing more than some snazzy suits angry eyes and that voice (oh that voice) to scare some discipline and self-respect into his charges. The kids are varsity b-ballers in the run-down town of Richmond Calif. who have an unspoken agreement with their tired teachers The punks dont care about learning and the grown-ups dont care about educating them. The teams center cant read; the power forward impregnates his girlfriend then dumps her; a smooth-shooting guard runs drugs on the side. As for the rest of the school only half the students will graduate. You know the drill. But thanks mainly to the lead actor this entry in a rather stale genre deserves to be put at the head of the class. The film is based on the life of Ken Carter the owner of a sporting-goods store who in 1998 took on the 1500-a-season second job of coaching basketball at his alma mater and made national headlines for his unorthodox methods to revive both team and school. Jacksons scenery-devouring performance is the epitome of a star turn not so much for his acting -- his role is heavy on the thunder thin on explaining why Carter would return to Richmond for a seemingly thankless task -- as for his awesome slightly villainous panache. You cant look away from the guy and director Thomas Carter (who helmed the hit MTV film ""Save the Last Dance"" and is no relation to the coach) wisely feels the same way tracking the big bad man wherever he goes. Just the way Jackson delivers his wrath -- his cadence his seething his slowly increasing volume -- as he stresses the student part of student-athlete and demands that his players sign a contract to obey his laws (must maintain a 2.3 GPA must wear neckties on game days must call him ""sir"") is worth the ticket price. ""You will have my respect until you abuse it"" and ""Ill ask you one last time to leave my gym or ILL HELP YOU LEAVE"" arent terribly clever lines but Jackson somehow makes them notable quotables. Theres more to ""Coach Carter"" than just Jackson. The basketball footage is often thrilling the camera whooshing through the action like a darting point guard as the Oilers -- who spend most of their grueling practices glaring at the coach doing push-ups and running ""suicide"" sprints -- blow away their opponents primarily because theyre better conditioned than everyone else. Although most of the kid actors arent asked to do more than act cocky -- then in a second-half switcheroo act humbled -- several performances are quite good. Rob Brown whom you might remember from the 2000 Sean Connery heartwarmer ""Finding Forrester"" plays the dad-to-be with a nuanced blend of arrogance and fear and his scenes with his girlfriend (Ramp;B star Ashanti fine in her film debut) are sweet. As the drug-pushing three-point specialist Rick Gonzalez comes out of nowhere for a brutal scene in which his shady side job catches up to him. And Robert Richard adds some much-needed levity as Coach Carters straight-A son Damien who transfers from a cushy private school to the street-tough Richmond just so he can play for his pop. Of course the real Ken Carter didnt capture the attention of Bob Costas and ESPN just because he was a strict son of a gun. In the midst of an undefeated season (and after winning just four games the year before) the coach receives academic progress reports on his students. Bad news Most of the players are either failing all their classes or not bothering to show up at all. So Coach Carter padlocks the gym door and cancels game after game until the team can collectively get its grades up. Players teachers and parents are outraged and call for his dismissal. Someone shatters the front window of his sporting-goods store. Someone else spits on his windshield a powder-keg scene in which Jackson utters an ""Aw hell no"" and explodes from his car. (Pity the loogier) When a school board overturns the lockout Carter decides to resign feeling hes the only one who cares about academics. The movie is way too long at almost 2 1/2 hours (you dont think it ends with him quitting do you?) and a weepy ending turns into several weepy endings each one more obvious than the last. But all hail Jackson a pros pro a movie star in the grandest sense who stays tough as nails throughout. He sheds no tears. He delivers no gushy speeches. He is never anything less than a bad . . . shut your mouth Coach Carter (137 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence sexual content profanity teen partying and some drug material.

Before that he directed episodes of ""Miami Vice"" and ""Hill Street Blues"" and before that he was an actor most famously playing student-athlete James Hayward on the TV show ""The White Shadow"" a late 70s inner-city high-school basketball drama. So you could say hes come full circle. There are parallels between Thomas Carters first and most recent jobs. Both story lines concern former basketball stars who take high-school coaching jobs and turn a ragtag insolent team into champions. On his first day on the job Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) addresses each of his players as ""sir"" -- giving them the respect he expects in return -- and hands out contracts. Among the clauses They have to maintain a 2.3 GPA they have to sit in the front row of all their classes and they have to wear suits and ties on game day. Otherwise no ball. Based on a real story ""Coach Carter"" isnt simply battling the ghosts of ""White Shadow"" here but the entire teacher/student subgenre. It often loses this battle. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Coach Carter"" with Samuel L. Jackson Robert Richard Rob Brown Ashanti Rick Gonzalez. Directed by Thomas Carter from a screenplay by Mark Schwahn and John Gatins. 136 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence sexual content language teen partying and some drug material. Several theaters. Parents object to Carters tough standards like the parents in ""Lean on Me"" but hes unapologetic like that movies Joe Clark. The female principal is at best a silent ally at worst an obstacle to progress like the principal in ""Radio."" Players are enticed by gang life and one players girlfriend gets pregnant which feels very ""White Shadow""-y -- its a subplot that although it avoids cliched characters and easy answers isnt particularly dramatic. Its one of the films weaker aspects. One of its better aspects? The lessons dont stop once the players win; its when the lessons start. Full of themselves now -- celebrating easy buckets and trash-talking the vanquished -- Carter hilariously does the same during practice to show how foolish they look. ""Since when is winning not enough?"" he asks. He counsels against using a racial epithet. He peppers them with life questions. He keeps their eyes on the prize sports not as an end in itself but as a means to becoming better people. Carters story gained national attention in 1999 when (again reminiscent of Joe Clark) he chained the gymnasium doors because several players were failing their classes. The team was state-tournament-bound but Carter refused to allow them to play or practice until they got their grades up. Unlike society as a whole he puts the ""student"" in ""student-athlete"" first. This message is certainly welcome but ""Coach Carter"" is overlong and uneven. None of the young actors blows you away and the final speech is so stuffed with cliches my jaw dropped. Even Jackson is surprisingly one-note in the title role. What is his inner life like? Does he have one? Must decency be dull?

Starring Samuel L. Jackson Rich Gonzalez Robert Richard Ashanti. Directed by Thomas Carter. Written by Mark Schwahn and John Gatins. (PG-13. 137 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Hollywood has turned the story of an exceptional Bay Area basketball coach into a lively but standard-issue sports movie. ""Coach Carter"" about the former Richmond High coach features bursts of humor and electrifying energy offset by speechifying and a dud of a subplot. Coach Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) sparked national interest six years ago when he made a controversial decision regarding his team. Because that decision also produces a dramatic highlight of the film lets pretend everyone in the Bay Area doesnt already know about it and not give it away. Said event doesnt happen until well into the movie which starts with Carter a local businessman and former Richmond High basketball star observing the team hes been asked to coach a group of boys who are slow on the court and quick-tempered off it. Its telling that the films director Thomas Carter (""Save the Last Dance"") was one of the young stars of ""The White Shadow."" ""Coach Carter"" is not too far removed from that old TV series in which a no-nonsense coach faced resistance from his inner-city players except its a little less subtle. Shot mostly in Los Angeles and Long Beach -- one naval-shipyard town is the same as the next the thinking probably went -- ""Coach Carter"" never looks too out of place. Thats because most of it occurs indoors or at night in medium shots of mean streets that could be in any city. But the script by Mark Schwahn and John Gatins strays from reality straight away. Here the big event happens during Carters first season as coach instead of when it really happened in his second season. But the change works to create a clean dramatic arc from the moment Carter first lays eyes on the boys to when he turns them around. Every scene that happens inside a gym is better than those that dont. When Jacksons coach Carter elegant in suit and tie regards his sloppy new charges through a haze of afternoon sun streaming through the gyms windows its a visual cliche but a pleasing one. We want the authority figure to take these boys in hand. The most obnoxious player (Rich Gonzalez) greets the coach with a racial slur. Knowing it probably didnt really happen this way doesnt diminish the scenes intensity. The fire in Gonzalezs eyes matches Jacksons patented glare. Forced to run like crazy and do 500 pushups for every bit of backtalk the Richmond Oilers begin to win and the movie takes off. The hoops scenes filmed in the hyperkinetic handheld style of ""Friday Night Lights"" take us inside the action on the court. Director Carter captures the excitement and ritual of a high school basketball game where the competition extends to the sidelines. In a funny scene Richmonds cheerleaders pretend to read newspapers as the opposing teams cheerleaders perform midcourt. The coach wants to win but hes more concerned with the players grades. He insists they maintain a 2.3 GPA even though the district requires only a 2. 0 and he requires them to wear suits and ties on game days. Parents and even faculty balk but Carter holds his ground which seems easier to do in the movie than it probably was in real life because of Jacksons regal bearing and ability to sound smarter than everyone else. Jackson at times resorts to the eyeglasses-removing school of acting where a character whips off his specs just as hes about to tell someone a thing or two. Thats the most he is required to stretch because the coach is presented as a sum of his principles rather than a well-rounded character. His son (the handsome winningly nerdy Robert Richard) plays on his team and is ultra-respectful on and off the court and his girlfriend (a wasted Debbi Morgan) seems to be in the movie simply to make Carter look like less of a drill sergeant. Jacksons natural slyness sneaks out occasionally and when it does you wish it would come out more. Hes hilarious in a scene where the coach ties his shoe and then exalts about his shoe-tying prowess in order to ridicule his players own grandstanding. ""Coach Carter"" is an MTV Films release which means it should be all about the soundtrack but its not and director Carter deserves credit for that. The films Ramp;B and rap tunes are used judiciously and organically -- the kids groove to Alicia Keys or Kanye West at dances and parties where kids are supposed to be listening to music. The picture doesnt trot out hit songs to cover story gaps the way some teen-oriented films do. But the film kowtows to the MTV crowd in a different way one that hurts it. ""Coach Carter"" devotes several ho-hum scenes to the relationship of a college-bound player (Rob Brown from ""Finding Forrester"") and his pregnant girlfriend. One suspects this is because Ashanti plays the girlfriend. The singing star is adequate in her film debut although she sounds a little too Bronx as if she gets to Richmond via the 6 train. This subplot helps stretch the movie to an overlong two hours and 17 minutes. As the film drags on the speeches get more hackneyed. Jackson intones that the players having arrived as boys are leaving as men and so on. At one point the coach asks his team ""We are the Oilers -- what does that mean?"" Fortunately the subject is changed before he can wax poetic about local refineries. -- Advisory This film contains profanity violence racial slurs.

"Coach Carter delivers solid if cliched message - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Coach Carter delivers solid if cliched message By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 14 2005 If you dont get to church much but are even mildly concerned about the future of urban youth ""Coach Carter"" is here to offer well over two hours of secular sermonizing.Even if not this by-the-numbers basketball drama might be enough to put the fear of Samuel L. Jackson into you. As real-life basketball coach and motivational speaker Ken Carter Jackson barrels through this movies Richmond Calif. high school. His simmering performance has two maybe three notes -- outraged disappointment outraged joy and outraged outrage -- but Jacksons been doing vexed long enough to wring emotion out of it. And he obviously believes in this story which plays like a public service announcement for at-risk kids.In 1997 Carter who owned a local sporting goods store took the position of basketball coach at Richmond High an underserved school in a majority black and Hispanic community north of Oakland. Carter was a star player for Richmond in the 1970s and saw the job as an opportunity to reverse the teams losing record with a strict brutally no-nonsense -- sorry tough love -- approach to coaching.He had his players sign contracts obliging them to wear jackets and ties on game days sit at the front of their classes and maintain a 2.0 grade-point average. Good grades for him were a requirement to play because theyre key to having a meaningful professional future. So in 1999 when Carter discovered that a quarter of his Richmond Oilers were failing their classes he famously locked the team out of the gym and canceled games despite their undefeated record.In ""Coach Carter"" the 12 or so players Carter inherits are an aimless band of bickerers who need to be whipped into shape. The coachs fitness (and discipline) regimen consists of push-ups and ""suicides"" (assaultive sprints from the baseline to half-court) which over the course of the movie we see often. The players mock Carters suits (theyre churchy) his shiny pate and his articulation. The team migraine Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez) a pugnacious hothead even takes a shot at the coach and is promptly manhandled and expelled from the team.Thats on the first day.But as the hours roll on we learn that Timo hates his extracurricular life as a drug dealer and sees basketball as a way to stay out of trouble. We see that Carter is such a good coach that his freshman son Damien (Robert Richard) pulls out of the best school in the area to be led by his father at Richmond. We discover that the star player Junior Battle (Nana Gbewonyo) is barely literate and that Kenyon Stone (Rob Brown) a premiere student and a genuinely nice guy has a pregnant girlfriend played by the Ramp;B songbird Ashanti whose acting is much better than her dewy videos would lead you to expect. The movie turns Carters story into a gritty inner-city epic thats from-the-heart but unoriginal. The elements of urban black drama -- teen pregnancy street shootings miffed single parents the token white character -- are all present. Life in this movie spins in a repetitive cycle Every screwup is followed with recrimination then punishment then reconciliation. And for all the time we spend with these characters very few of them are brought to life though Brown and Gonzalez have real worry in their faces.The director Thomas Carter (whos not related to Ken) also made the Julia-Stiles-in-the-hood romance ""Save the Last Dance"" and he tackles the same themes here but with a more blatant ""save the children"" message. And Jackson is the ideal star to deliver a lecture with fire brimstone and panache which hes demonstrated in everything from his DJ in ""Do the Right Thing"" and reformed hit man in ""Pulp Fiction"" to the besieged teacher in ""187."" In ""Coach Carter"" he delivers a castigating speech on the problem with kids who use the ""n"" word on each other. Any owner of ""Jackie Brown"" will recognize the powerful irony in that.Eventually Carters principles get him in trouble with the principal (Denise Dowse) who cant understand why he bothers with the contracts and the lockout. The community also thinks canceling the games is an insult.But the movie deserves credit for vocalizing a lot of awful oft-cited numbers about graduation rates and the ratio of black men who attend college compared with those who wind up in jail. The only problem is that ""Coach Carter"" lays the problem at the feet of parents and a beleaguered school system without bothering to complicate it.Like ""Crazy"" Joe Clark the New Jersey principal who kicked out a sizable portion of his student body en masse in the 1980s Carter is a magnet for controversy. And like ""Lean on Me"" the 1989 movie about Clarks stint as a school official the coach is always right and everybody else is wrong wrong wrong. But the parents and teachers whom Morgan Freemans righteous Clark would shout down had a point The man did seem insane. At least you know where Jacksons character is coming from.My main worry about ""Coach Carter"" however is this Whos it for? How do you put this message across without it seeming medicinal? Sure MTV is among the movies producers but what 11th grader wants to spend a Friday night being hit with such a blunt instrument?Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Coach Carter is the real but rather long dealBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Coach Carter is 2 1/4 hours of MTV-produced tough love with a dance break and pool party to relieve -- momentarily -- a series of motivational rants from lead Samuel L. Jackson. If Samuel L. Jackson was yelling at us wed get our rears in gear too. Paramount Pictures The student-athlete mentor whom Jackson plays makes Gomer Pyles Sgt. Carter look like a wuss. But lets not be hypocritical. This fact-based basketball saga is lucky to have Jackson who carries the movie on his shoulders under some keenly form-fitting suits. Yet despite the storys provocative hook the execution is so slack that we come away feeling weve seen this yarn too many times before. But never at this length; any actor asked to carry it might as well be bench-pressing a Sequoia. The storys watershed event got national attention in early 1999 when coach Ken Carter of Richmond Calif. benched his entire high school team -- canceling games and practices -- because a few players werent performing academically. This is a terrifically effective way to become controversial in a depressed community where high school basketball probably represents lifes peak for many. About the movie Coach Carter   (out of four) Stars Samuel L. Jackson Robert Richard Rob Brown Ashanti Debbi Morgan Directors Thomas Carter Distributor Paramount Rated PG-13 for violence sexual content language teen partying and some drug material. Opens Friday nationwide The movie version begins with sports store owner Carter hired just to coach not teach though he turns out to be more academically minded than some of his bosses. Carter forces each member of his unruly squad to sign a contract ensuring a grade-point average above what the school requires. From then on its a one-man battle against team malcontents though it helps -- at least until Carter pulls the plug -- when a formerly undisciplined team starts winning. Nothing but the coachs gutsy move and the fact that it really happened distinguishes this movie from a litany of past basketball dramas. We also hear loud echoes from 1989s Lean on Me (school principal Joe Clark hanging tough against hoods). Singer Ashanti gets her quota of scenes as a players girlfriend one team member deals drugs and Carter has to deal with having his own son on the squad -- and with players sneaking out of the Safari Motel for some drunken pool revelry with suburban girls. These mostly ill-developed back stories stack up fast as the running time bloats.

"Coach Carter | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; coach-carter ) Coach Carter (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli The main problem with Coach Carter can be summed up simply too much sermonizing. In a way its hard to fault the film because its heart is in the right place. The movie wants to impress upon teenagers that education is the first step on the path to empowerment and that it is possible for students raised in poor neighborhoods to escape from the vicious cycle of poverty and violence. But good intentions and a positive message do not always make for a strong movie. Coach Carter wants to be motivational but it uses clichA(c)d short cuts and stock characters to emphasize its points and in the end the experience seems manufactured and scripted in a paint-by-numbers fashion even if it is said to be ""inspired by the life of Coach Ken Carter."" (The phrasing of that statement indicates that considerably liberties were taken.) As befits a movie with a lumbering 135-minute running time Coach Carter brings together a number of familiar storylines. Its a sports movie crossed with a crusading teacher movie with a dose of the big-speech courtroom drama thrown in for good measure. Set the cauldron brew to boil throw in some Dead Poets Society Hoosiers and Lean on Me and the result will be Coach Carter. The film is devoid of even the most rudimentary of surprises. And since that offers a certain comfort level it will connect with some audiences. But trust mea| if you watch movies regularly you have seen it all before and done better. When former two-time All American Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) agrees to take over the coaching job at his old alma mater Richmond High he comes with an agenda. Coach Carter wants to put the ""student"" back in the term ""student athlete."" In addition to being winners on the court he wants the members of the Richmond Oilers to be winners in the classrooms. To that end he forces each of them to sign a contract that obligates them to maintain a 2.3 GPA to attend every class and sit in the front row and to wear ties on game days. When it comes to discipline Coach Carter is ruthless - cross him and it might mean 500 push-ups or more. He emphasizes conditioning and defense over offense and his program works. The Oilers start the season in amazing fashion. Except for a little cockiness which the coach does his best to curb everything is going well - until the players academic progress reports arrive. In an attempt to humanize some of the characters Coach Carter plunders the stereotype clearance bin resulting in a bunch of unremarkable and largely uninteresting players. We have the borderline-illiterate senior (Nana Gbewonyo) who sees a chance for a college scholarship if he improves his academics. Theres a decent-seeming young man (Rob Brown) who faces the challenge of teenage fatherhood after impregnating his girlfriend (Ashanti). A gang-banger (Rick Gonzalez) is torn between making lots of money on the street or playing basketball. And the coachs academic-minded son (Robert RiChard) must bond with his less studious teammates. Coach Carters A-list actor Samuel L. Jackson is far from the top of his game. Other than a strong screen presence he doesnt bring much to the role. His kinetic tirades recall his Pulp Fiction character and his moments of quiet intensity remind us that Laurence Fishburne is a much better slow-simmerer. Its likely that Jackson took this role because he believes in the films message; its unfortunate that there isnt more subtlety in the way he portrays Ken Carter. Still compared to him most of the films other stars are in the minor leagues. Theres plenty of raw acting talent amongst the group playing the Oilers but little in the way of polish. And singer Ashanti should heed the old maxim and not quit her day job. Her performance is awkward and self-conscious. She possesses charisma but her acting is forced. Coach Carter suffers from Bloated Running Time Syndrome - a problem that plagues many self-styled ""important"" films. Why tell a story in an hour and three-quarters when it can be stretched out by 30 extra minutes? The movies first hour moves at a nice pace but then a series of predictable complications bogs it down. And the emotional climax arrives 20 minutes before the end credits roll. (After all theres still a big basketball game to be played.) The game scenes are filmed in a perfunctory unimaginative manner and theres never any real suspense about how things are going to turn out (except perhaps in the final contest). Director Thomas Carter likes message movies. In his career he has helmed at least two others Swing Kids and Save the Last Dance. But Coach Carter is by far his loudest statement. But as much as I applaud what Carter is saying with this creaky melodrama its hard to recommend the film. Is it inspirational? Perhaps but so are many church sermons and its also clumsy and obvious. Its tough to give Coach Carter a passing grade. Coach Carter (United States 2005) Director Thomas Carter Cast Samuel L.

Jackson; Director Thomas Carter; Release Date Wide 01/14/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 140; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Studios Posted January 12 2005 -- 1200 AM EST In Coach Carter Samuel L. Jackson plays one of those sternly compassionate inner-city teacher-demigods who have been a staple of movies for half a century ever since Glenn Ford took over the leather-jacketed class of The Blackboard Jungle (1955). It isnt difficult to see why this genre has persisted Corny as it often is theres a built-in gratification to watching a fearless and indomitable educational hero draft order out of chaos winning over the troubled hearts and minds of kids who dont believe in themselves. As Ken Carter a self-made sporting-goods-store owner who returns to his alma mater of Richmond High -- where he was the star hoopster 30 years ago -- in order to whip the basketball team into shape Jackson is playing a coach a drill sergeant and a tough-love academic whip-cracker rolled into one. The actor wears blocky ornate ties and beautifully cut suits that never quite let you forget his height and he sports the jutting shaved dome that he brandished in Shaft and the Star Wars films. That shiny imposing head is all too appropriate since Jacksons Carter is a stoic Jedi guru of discipline. The moment he strolls onto the court facing down a team of slovenly aggressive misfits who (the film suggests) have grown up with too much hip-hop and not enough self-respect Jackson rules the movie with his joyful inflections; he uses the nimble music of his voice to turn threats into play. Its fun to see Carter dole out the punishment of hundreds of push-ups and ""suicides"" each time a team member dares to be late or even worse mouth off about it. For Coach Carter however its not enough for the Richmond Oilers to find victory on the court. He insists that the players all sign contracts in which they agree to maintain 2.3 grade point averages; if they dont they wont play. Eventually when they are most of the way through an undefeated season but failing to fulfill that classroom bargain he padlocks the gym and forces the Oilers to forfeit games until they get their academic act together. Suddenly the city of Richmond which had rallied behind Carters success wants his head. Coach Carter is based on a true story (the real Ken Carter locked out his team in 1999) but is there anything in movies less convincing than a high-school-neer-do-wells-get-down-and-study montage? Its a trick admittedly to show people learning math -- though Stand and Deliver (1988) made feisty drama out of it. The overly long and facile Coach Carter doesnt; it presents as a victory of inspiration something that is by nature 90 percent perspiration. Jackson though does lend this earnest formula flick a core of conviction. Its actually his second teacher movie (after the misbegotten 187). Perhaps hell eventually find one worthy of his voice.

Younger urban auds enthusiasm may be questionable but their parents and teachers will heartily endorse the self-improvement message making for good theatrical B.O. followed by a 3-pointer in vid. Embracing the story of a tough high school basketball coach who pushes young men to their limits ""Coach Carter"" is both an inspirational sports movie and an unexpected multi-level urban drama that plays by its own clock. Since the true story of Richmond High coach Ken Carter involves far more than hoops pics adherence to the details and willingness to follow characters wherever they go account for a running time exceeding 21/4 hours. Younger urban auds enthusiasm may be questionable but their parents and teachers will heartily endorse the self-improvement message making for good theatrical B.O. followed by a 3-pointer in vid. Carters (and son Damiens) personal involvement in the production probably added a strong whiff of credibility to screenwriters Mark Schwahns and John Gatins on-the-nose dialogue and situations. Samuel L. Jackson in the title role lifts the film above familiar sports movie fare however imbuing a man who preaches the straight-and-narrow with magnetic appeal in portraying Coach Carter as an alluring rebel with equal parts charm and radical tough love. Carters at first hesitant to take over the hoops spot at his alma mater given that the Richmond Oilers stink on the court and fight when off of it. Sensing diamonds in the rough he takes the post anyway and gets down to the business of showing the squad whos boss. Mouthing off is punished with calisthenics the coach is always addressed as ""sir"" and most crucially each team member must sign a contract to maintain a minimum grade average attend all classes sit in the front row and wear a coat and tie on game day. With Jackson delivering the edicts nearly everyone gets in line except Timo (Rick Gonzalez) whose rebelliousness gets him booted out -- and into the streets where he deals drugs. Director Thomas Carter (no relation) patiently follows the storys internal rhythms devoting a good deal of screentime to the step-by-step drills and exercises that mold the squad into a winning team. But helmer Carter also dwells on various off-court relationships such as the one between Kenyon (Rob Brown) a good student with dreams of playing college ball and pregnant g.f. Kyra (pop star Ashanti). A certain dramatic neatness irons out what might have been a much more unkempt film Just as the team pulls off a tournament upset the coach discovers most of his boys are failing their classes. His decision to shut down the gym force the team to study in the school library and enrage the locals is what made the real Carter into a folk hero when his story broke in 1999. At this point though the film becomes perhaps more surprising The press isnt made into a bunch of clowns Carters critics have their say and the teammates grow into solid student-athletes gradually not instantly. An almost exact replica thematically of the finale in ""Friday Night Lights"" may be accidental but is still uncomfortably similar. Jackson rules the kids but they hold up with hearty perfs by Brown Gonzalez Ashanti and Robert Richard as the coachs son. Denise Dowses by-the-rules school principal is mired in the scripts most obvious points. Even factoring the pics unevenness and itch to preach it reps a formal and thematic leap from the soft fare produced by sports-crazy Brian Robbins and Mike Tollin. Richmonds harshness is more suggested than real in a conservatively conceived production with pro widescreen lensing by Sharone Meir. Some cool hip-hop selections make Trevor Rabins score sound silly. Coach CarterProductionA Paramount release of an MTV Films and Tollin/Robbins production.
