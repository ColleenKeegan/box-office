Director Foley pickpockets freely from Mamets House of Games and even enlists that pictures cameraman to conjure similar stretches of nocturnal melancholy. Such brazenness suggests a case of misplaced confidence. It doesnt help that Foley has cast Burns as grifter extraordinaire Jake Vig. Having swindled the accountant of crime boss The King (Hoffman) Jake agrees to make amends by pulling the fast one to end all fast ones. Robert Forster gets a seductive intro as the Lucifer whom Jakes gang (including Weisz as a light fingered minx) plans to scam but the film is so cavalier in its abandonment of him that it plays like a slip of the editors scissors. Thats consistent with the generally erratic focus. Hollywoods sleaziest sadsacks (Giamatti Guzman Lynch) easily trump the synthetic glamour of Burns and Weisz while you end up applauding Hoffmans shrill turn for the jolt of vulgarity that it brings to a timid film.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Ed Burns in Confidence and John Cusack in Indentity. Slate Sign In Sign Up Ed Burns in Confidence and John Cusack in Indentity. Ed Burns in Confidence and John Cusack in Indentity. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 25 2003 440 PM Houses of Games Confidence and Identity two slick movies that share a special lousiness. By David Edelstein Confidence (Lions Gate) and Identity (Columbia) are one-word-title Hollywood efforts by slick American directors named James (Foley and Mangold) that share an essential lousiness--a reverberant emblematic lousiness. Neither is obviously terrible Theyre fast snazzily crafted acted with relish and full of showoff dialogue by screenwriters barely out of film school; and theyll get plenty of reviews studded with adjectives like ""stylish"" and ""mind-bending."" But their scripts are empty exercises copies of copies of old movies tricked out with up-to-the-second technical or narrative gimmicks and whorishly calculated to tug on the private parts of studio executives and actors agents. I saw them back-to-back and left feeling hungry for a movie. Advertisement The more irritating of the pair--by miles--is Confidence which was obviously written by someone (Doug Jung fresh out of NYU film school) who saw The Sting (1973) as a kid and drank in the Tao of David Mamet. The movie opens with an overhead shot of its narrator in a pool of blood ""So Im dead"" he says in voice-over. (Killer opening huh?) Played by Edward Burns hes a grifter called Jake Vig (killer name huh?) who has he tells us been brought down by a redhead called Lily Finn (ditto). Jake is telling his story to us--but hes also in flashback telling it to his assassin (Morris Chestnut) and in that flashback-inside-a-flashback telling more stories that lead to more flashbacks. The fashionably spiraling syntax seems meant to distract us from an old-hat premise See Jake and his crew of con artists (which includes a pair of crooked cops played by Luis Guzman and Donal Logue) have inadvertently stolen cash on its way to a vicious crime boss (Dustin Hoffman) whose goons are now hunting them. Rather than take it on the lam Jake strolls into the lions den and nervily proposes a joint con. Is he simply trying to save himself or does he plan to exact an elaborate revenge for the killing of one of his cohorts? No clue from Jake who plays his cards close to the vest--or from Burns who is such a glibly insincere actor that theres no point looking for ""tells."" The dull bulk of the movie is his scheme to bilk a banker (Robert Forster) with underworld ties out of several million dollars an elaborate shell game that requires the recruitment of a ""skirt""--Lily Finn (Rachel Weisz) a pickpocket who might or might not have an agenda of her own. Foleys agenda involves color. One character bathed in blue converses with one bathed in green in front of a square of red. Sometimes the square is yellow and the faces are red; sometimes the faces are yellow and the square is purple. Sometimes those blue/green/red faces are in tight close-up revealing more than you want to know about the actors skin conditions. There are fancy transitions from scene to scene--whoosh pans swoosh pans split screens with one frame goosing another out of the way. Foley uses every gimmick he can think of to keep the picture in motion. This is known in some quarters as style--although true style as Kenneth Tynan once pointed out doesnt labor so unstylishly to call attention to itself. Confidence is for people who like movies with crosses and double crosses and double-double crosses and triple-gainer-double-whammy crosses. Im not a big fan of Mamets houses of games but at least his worldview is consistent Life is one big con everyone screws everyone etc. Screenwriter Jung is selling a different idea his own brilliance. In one scene Jake names possible marks inside the bankers company and each appears on screen in a mock newspaper personal ad--but all I could think of was ""Single White Screenwriter wants attention."" A man shot while eating is described as dying ""right in the middle of his egg foo yong."" There are probably restaurants that still make egg foo yong but its a good bet that screenwriter ""Egg Foo"" Jung grew up on Szechwan and has never tasted the stuff. Advertisement Hordes of good actors evidently lined up to appear in Confidence which wastes Weisz Guzman Logue Forster and Paul Giamatti among others. Midway through a grizzled Andy Garcia shambles in chewing on a cigar as an FBI agent; hes so fatuously hammy that his true narrative function is never in doubt. (""A good chess player can see up to 20 moves deep"" intones Jake. Im not much of a chess player yet I could spot Jungs strategy after 15 minutes.) As for Ed Burns I used to hope hed concentrate on acting because then hed direct fewer movies. But I can avoid the movies he directs whereas he shows up as an actor in movies I want to see. What a hard call. ... As the homicidal crime-boss King Dustin Hoffman looks at first to be reprising his great Robert Evans impression which he showed off in last years The Kid Stays in the Picture and most memorably in Wag the Dog (1997). But the part goes nowhere and the performance dissolves into a medley of scuzzy-wacko tics--gum cracking flashing his big choppers casting homosexually insinuating glances at the lunkish Burns. Hoffman doesnt usually go in for scenery-chewing turns like this. He must have watched a few Al Pacino movies and thought ""Anything he can chew I can chew better"" 1234 can I have a little more? Identity turns into a much weirder exercise in genre bending but the first hour is relatively straight and reasonably entertaining. The premise is almost too dated to believe. A bunch of stock characters are trapped in a rundown motel battered by a furious rainstorm The bridges are out the phones are dead (and the cell phones cant get a signal) and someone is killing the cast off one by one--leaving a room key (the numbers counting down from 10) beside each corpse. Before you can say And Then There Were None someone mentions it--but the postmodern reference doesnt dispel the tension since the atmosphere has been flamboyantly (and evocatively) old-movie-ish from the start. The screenwriter Michael Cooney has roots in Grade-Z hack-em-ups like Jack Frost (1997--not the one where Michael Keaton comes back as a snowman) but that might be a blessing here He knows his way around dumb scare-picture tricks. He and Mangold and the excellent actors (among them John Cusack Amanda Peet Ray Liotta and Clea Duvall) find the perfect middle ground between the overripe and the campy so that we actually find ourselves getting rattled by the hoary B-movie conventions. Forget about the overproduced remakes of William Castles House on Haunted Hill (1958) and 13 Ghosts (1960) This seems like a good modest Castle-type melodrama. Except it isnt. Identity takes a dive into the meta that I wont spoil--except to say that Cooney and Mangold want it both ways to generate B-movie chills and give you fancy Matrix-like levels of illusion and reality at the same time. The problem is that the finale doesnt build on the horror stuff that has preceded it It renders it inconsequential. And the newfangled psychological resolution is much much more simpleminded than any of the third-generation Agatha Christie stuff. Identity is suicidally insecure.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

The ""party"" call went out to college students for an all-expenses-paid spring break vacation at a beachfront resort in Cancun. The only requirements a hard body a soft head and exhibitionist tendencies. Heidi and Dave scope out the beach scene in The Real Cancun a reality-based study of spring break. Cancun features dozens of scantily clad and uninhibited folks inane conversation binge drinking and transparent posturing. Those who expect lots of nudity will see plenty of suggestive dancing and lascivious poses but only a few bare breasts bums and sex acts kept under wraps (or sheets). Viewers will zero in quickly on the most obnoxious of the pack. Jeremy the blond stud brags ""Girls go on spring break to meet guys like me"" and beds a few of them. Nicole and Roxanne the Texan twins put on a beachfront show that would make Showgirls Elizabeth Berkley blush. Then theres Alan the shy guy who prefers milk to shots of tequila. The rest of the crowd induces him to drink and he spends much of the trip drunk. His favorite refrain ""I just wanna see some boobies."" Those who sit through this mindlessness get the booby prize. --Claudia Puig It Runs in the Family The title easily could refer to the acting talent of the Douglas clan. Father and son Kirk and Michael Douglas moments together are among the movies best. Michaels 24-year-old son Cameron and Michaels mother (Kirks ex) Diana also put in strong performances making the overall experience worthwhile though the story is predictable. The comedy-drama initially might appear to be based on real-life elements but its fictional. The movie opens with shots of old photos a reminder of 86-year-old Kirk Douglas glory days. The character he plays attorney Mitchell Gromberg has had a stroke just as Douglas has. Though the actors speech is slurred it is always understandable. Alex is experiencing a midlife crisis and his son Asher (Cameron) is having his own rebellious period. Alex is married to Rebecca (Bernadette Peters) a psychologist trying to understand the quiet ways of their 11-year-old son Eli (Rory Culkin) who in a way is the most mature male in the family. Michael Douglas does a credible job as the petulant son who nearly strays from his wife and is inattentive to his children but still emerges as a likable sort. A noteworthy scene in which father and son stage a relatives ""burial at sea"" in an upscale suburb is a hoot. But a few other moments most of them involving Cameron and his love interest (Michelle Monaghan) feel like a cliched WB sitcom. Mark Hammer an amputee does an excellent job as Alexs elderly uncle. His performance and that of Kirk Douglas powerfully illustrate the indomitable spirit of individuals who refuse to let disabilities impede their goals. For that alone the movie is worth watching. (PG-13 drug content sexual material language) --C. P. Identity There are a couple of identity crises brewing in the psychological thriller Identity. Someone is killing off 10 strangers stranded together in a remote motel during a violent storm. And identifying the murderer is what the movie purports to be about. But halfway through the killer is revealed and suspense dwindles as the movie morphs into a psychodrama about the workings of a deranged mind and the efficacy of the insanity defense. Reviews of the movies Real Cancun (out of four) It Runs in the Family Identity Confidence People I Know Ostensibly inspired by Agatha Christies Ten Little Indians Identity relies excessively on its lineage a conceit that has become fairly tired. John Cusack is convincing as a decent but enigmatic limo driver ferrying a spoiled TV star (Rebecca De Mornay). When they have an accident on a deserted road that injures the mother of a small child (Leila Kenzle) Cusack and the womans husband (John C. McGinley) seek assistance at the only open establishment a seedy motel run by a suspicious night manager (John Hawkes). Soon a storm forces others to converge on the place a call girl (Amanda Peet) a cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey) and a pair of newlyweds (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott.) With moments of mind-bending creepiness the film has potential but eventually it devolves into merely a head-scratcher. (R strong violence and language.) --C. P. Confidence Director James Foleys slick handsome package isnt about that feeling you get when you hit a karaoke high-note or a softball at a picnic. Its about the other kind of confidence grifting cheating the rackets sleights-of-hand and the built-in victim -- who in this case ends up dead. Unfortunately the corpse turns out to have worked for a lowlife Mr. Big which means that the offending crew members (Edward Burns Paul Giamatti) must visit the boss to make amends. They find an outwardly seedy but subliminally scary string-puller played by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffmans colorfully ill-groomed creep suggests what Midnight Cowboys Ratso Rizzo might have become if hed had more money but less character. Hoffman wants his visitors to rip off an even bigger Big (Robert Forster) setting off 75 more minutes of did-I-just-see-that? for audiences. Even with Burns smoothest performance yet as a lead Confidence is on a level with Steven Soderberghs blah remake of Oceans Eleven. But because no one is expecting much it seems a little better. Movies can pull off sleights-of-hand too. (R language violence and sexuality/nudity) --Mike Clark People I Know As a Manhattan transplant suddenly in over his head fading publicist Al Pacino wont own a cell phone and keeps referring to ""the old days"" when he represented Montgomery Clift and Mama Cass in the showbiz jungle. Filmed two years ago this sometimes incisive but finally overbaked drama deals with murder intrigue and an unnamed mayor whos a hot-button issue for minorities. In reaction Pacino (wisely underplaying a showy part) sponsors a benefit for jailed Nigerian immigrants without green cards. While trying to get celebrities to show up (""I have Regis"" is dangled bait) hes tangentially involved in the killing of a druggie starlet. Victim Tea Leoni memorably spits out put-downs and the movie loses something with her exit. Kim Basinger has a few scenes as a gorgeous widow who wants Pacino to give it all up for her Virginia farm. It wont be a waste of time to watch these people -- on cable and probably not too far in the future. (In New York and Los Angeles. R language drug use sexual images) --M. C.

For CONFIDENCE25 Photo HO Confidence builds / Well-acted thriller is easy to follow -- or so it seems 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Confidence Thriller. Starring Edward Burns Rachel Weisz Andy Garcia and Dustin Hoffman. Directed by James Foley. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) At the intersection where acting meets criminality is ""Confidence"" a movie about a team of adventurers who act for life-and-death stakes. Theyre con men and they play to conscripted audiences that have no idea theyre watching a performance -- until later when they get the bill. ""Confidence"" is a very smart thriller that celebrates the act of lying or to be more specific the art of acting. Like real-life con men the characters here are in it for the money but like actors theyre also in it for the power of asserting their personalities and for the exhilaration of embodying a fantasy. As such they have a kind of innocence that allows us to root for them. We want them to get away with it. The film is well acted by an unusually strong ensemble headed by Edward Burns Dustin Hoffman and Andy Garcia and directed by James Foley with the neo-noirish panache that he demonstrated in ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" But the real star of this one is the screenplay by first-time screenwriter Doug Jung who tells a complex and multilayered story without getting himself tied up in knots. Even when we dont know whats going on we think we do and each time we find out otherwise theres never any confusion. Everything is clear -- even when it only seems to be. Related Stories Smart script inspires Confidence / Twisted plot acting top-notch The audacious opening minutes demonstrate a confidence worthy of the movies name. Jung starts with a flashback and then a flashback within a flashback as the movies crooked hero Jake (Burns) tells his story. We see Jake and his crew orchestrating a brilliant con only to realize days later that the money theyve fleeced belongs to a big-time gangster known as ""the King."" In any other movie the crew would start running but in ""Confidence"" the fellows are smart enough to know that this gangster has tentacles that extend across the country. Besides Jake is a cool customer. So he puts on his best suit and goes to see the King proposing that his people pay back their debt by doing a con on the Kings behalf. The casting of Hoffman as the crime boss is inspired. Instead of the usual hulking menace or an eerily smiling Robert De Niro we find this seedy little guy who needs a shave -- someone twisted by power and utterly depraved and yet still retaining traces of the friendly needy nerd he might have been. This gives the scenes between Burns and Hoffman an extra edge beyond what the screenplay provides. Despite the power the King has over him Jake cannot help looking upon him with the disdain of the handsome guy for the creepy guy -- while the King looks on Jake with an admiration that can easily turn into dangerous resentment. Most of the movie involves a big international heist orchestrated at the Kings instigation by Jakes crew including a chronically dyspeptic fellow (played by the fine character actor Paul Giamatti with his usual glum aplomb); and a mystery woman Lily played by British actress Rachel Weisz. ""Confidence"" marks Weiszs return to her sexy scowling French-inhaling mode. As the bad girl here shes as quiet and as wide-eyed as a plastic doll but all-seeing and all-disdaining. The less any review says about the heist the better except to note that the movie cleverly sets up a situation of mounting pressure. Jake has to worry about the feds as embodied by a shrewd agent (Garcia). He has to worry about the cops about the King and also about the private goons of the tycoon hes trying to rob. Ultimately the con we witness in the movie is almost as beautiful as the con that is the movie -- believable in the moment too irresistible to question upon reflection and executed with invigorating confidence. . This film contains sexual situations strong language and violence.

Watching someone perform the subtle art of deception whether its for sexual power in ""Dangerous Liaisons"" or sophisticated money-swindling in such films as ""House of Games"" or ""The Grifters"" is almost always intriguing. Perhaps were rooting for the con men the scammers jealous of their smoothness the ease with which they sail through life free of the restrictions that bind most of us. Or maybe were thinking Thank God it wasnt me that just got suckered. Either way its great to watch the cat-and-mouse of it all -- even when the movie might not be firing on all points. Edward Burns plays Jake Vig a slick good-looking confidence man who works with a team. In classic form we meet them as they pull off one of their special maneuvers. Playing their roles in an apparent deal gone wrong they fool a panicky sleazy guy out of his money. But after the smoke clears and their target has left them with a pile of cash theres trouble ahead that no one could have anticipated. It seems Jake and company just swindled the accountant of a dangerous crime boss named Winston King who shows them their mistake when he takes immediate and bloody retribution. Angered by the kingpins retaliatory strike the resourceful Jake enters the lair of the gangster (Dustin Hoffman) to strike a mutually beneficial deal. Jake offers to make Winston even more money as well as glory by scamming one of the crime bosss biggest enemies a banker with ties to organized crime. The prospect intrigues Winston. He goes for it insisting that one of his powerful goons tag along for the ride. Assembling a new team for the scam Winston recruits lone operator and steamy brunette Lily (Rachel Weisz) who screams ""romantic interest."" Let the games begin. Few should be surprised to learn that in this movie theres always another scam at work. ""Confidence"" is certainly no threat to such top-notch con-game entertainments as ""Grifters"" or David Mamets ""Games."" Although he does a commendable job as the movies smoothest operator Burnss character remains secondhand. Hes a ""leading man"" modeled perhaps on such cover-boy characters as Richard Geres Julian in ""American Gigolo."" Does he really know all the grifter rules and harbor the con mans superstitions? Does he exude the subtextual power this movie would like him to? Or are we watching a pretty boy aping this kind of character? As for Jakes crew -- played with ensemble enthusiasm by Paul Giamatti Brian Van Holt and Louis Lombardi -- we dont see what really binds them together. Theyre a sort of instant-pals group for Jake like walking talking background scenery. And the less said about Weiszs character the better. And yet despite these and other shortcomings (do we really need a flashback storytelling style with the hero-narrator at gunpoint?) ""Confidence"" remains enjoyable. Hoffman helps. He has obviously received Christopher Walken-size freedom to make his character as quirky and strange as he wants. So when Winston semi-flirts with Jake noting his impressive glutes or directs two stripper-sisters to perform sexual fun-and-games routines that still remain ""tasteful"" he makes the movie more interesting and pushes the chess game between himself and Jake into a more compelling zone. And finally there is the simple joy of the con game. Being fooled getting taken for a ride with someone at the controls -- these are the elements that keep us watching. And we know that as soon as one piece of trickery comes to light therell be others to savor. CONFIDENCE (R 98 minutes) -- Contains violence and obscenity. Area theaters.

"CNN.com - Review Have Confidence Film is great - Apr. 24 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Review Have Confidence Film is great Good cast handles twisty witty movie with aplomb By Paul ClintonCNN Ed Burns and Dustin Hoffman in ""Confidence."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- In ""Confidence"" Ed Burns Dustin Hoffman Andy Garcia and Rachel Weisz use a complex scheme of offshore accounts wire transfers corporate loans phony killings fake blood and creative accounting to pull off a complicated scam. Its a smart and sassy dark comedy that will keep you laughing and guessing until the very end. In ""Confidence"" there are only two rules. The first rule is that nothing and no one are what they seem to be. The second rule is there are no rules. Burns plays Jake Vig a handsome talented grifter at the top of his game. Hes swindled hundreds of thousands of dollars from unsuspecting marks across the country. But he and his motley crew Gordo (Paul Ciamatti) Miles (Brian Van Holt) Big Al (Louis Lombardi) and two corrupt Los Angeles detectives -- Whitworth (Donal Logue) and Manzano (Luis Guzman) -- pick the wrong sucker when they rip off an accountant who works for the King a highly eccentric L.A. crime boss gleefully portrayed by Hoffman. It seems the accountant used -- and lost -- the Kings money. In an effort to save his perfectly tanned skin Jake comes up with a plan. Hell cut the King in on another scam hes pulling on the Kings rival Morgan Price (Robert Forster) a sleazy banker with mob connections. If the King provides the seed money Jake will reel Price in and split the profits with his new partner in addition to paying him back the money swindled from the hapless accountant. The King calls Jake ""Tiger"" and seems to have a little crush on the good-looking con man as he reluctantly agrees to the plan. But no fool he sends along one of his own goons to supervise. Added to this group is a beautiful pickpocket named Lily played by Weisz. The stage is now set. Gigantic shell game Rachel Weisz plays a clever moll in ""Confidence."" What follows is a dazzling series of crosses and double crosses alliances formed and broken and millions of dollars being shuffled to and from bank accounts around the world. The whole film is a gigantic shell game and good luck keeping track of the pea. First time screenwriter Doug Jung has created a multi-layered complex story that snaps crackles and pops with sparkling dialogue interesting characters and a twisted plotline that defies logic -- yet fits together like a perfectly made jigsaw puzzle at the end. Director James Foley (1992s ""Glengarry Glen Ross"") is adept at getting the best out of high-profile ensemble casts. ""Confidence"" proves to be no exception. Two-time Oscar winner Hoffman recently changed agents and if this small -- but pivotal -- role as the sexually ambivalent mob boss is a result of that change then it was well worth it. Imagine that Ratso Rizzo 34 years after ""Midnight Cowboy"" gets his leg fixed moves to L.A. and buys a strip club. It could happen. Good chemistry Im not a huge Ed Burns fan -- at least not as an actor -- but his cool aloofness is a perfect fit for Jake Vig. Besides anyone who could direct write and star in ""The Brothers McMullen"" (1995) budgeted at only 25000 -- it went on to make 10 million -- has to have a little con man inside working overtime. And Weisz fresh off her successful film ""About A Boy"" starring Hugh Grant once again delivers the goods as the sexy and mysterious Lily. As the only woman in this gang of scene-stealing thugs shes an island of sexual coolness. She also creates hot chemistry with Burns who usually has the sex appeal of Al Gore. And Andy Garcia playing undercover FBI agent Gunther Butan is terrific. He seems to be having a ball playing the hygienically impaired G-man who has been chasing Vig all over the country and has now finally caught up with him in L.A. while in the middle of his latest scam. Combining the slickness of ""The Grifters"" (1990) and the humor of ""Get Shorty"" (1995) ""Confidence"" is an intelligent fast-paced winner that throughly entertains. ""Confidence"" opens nationwide on Friday April 25 and is rated R.

Clocking in at a trim 97 minutes the movie directed by James Foley from an impeccably literate script by newcomer Doug Jung unveils enough plot twists to cross the eyes of even the most seasoned crime-caper enthusiast. The movies structural intricacies rival those of Memento but Confidence is as warm playful and inclusive of its audience as Memento was harsh and distant. Early on someone announces that the con game ""is like putting on a play where everyone knows his part -- except the mark."" There will be marks aplenty as the action unfolds and the big one of course is us. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - ""So Im dead"" announces Jake Vig (Edward Burns) the narrator and trickster-in-chief as his blood-spattered body lies spread-eagled in a back alley. Then the action backs up three weeks and gives us Jake and his team of sidekicks in another gory face-off in which one of Jakes team is shot dead as is the accountant of a powerful pornmeister known as the King (Dustin Hoffman). Jake offers to make it up to the King by pulling off his most impudent con yet with crooked super-banker Morgan Price (Robert Forster in a cameo) as the patsy. To this end along with his usual cronies (who include a couple of bent cops played by Donal Logue and the indispensable Luis Guzman) Jake recruits Lily a beautiful identity thief played by the sultry Rachel Weisz who applies herself with such brio to drawling the word asshole that you quite forget the actress is a decidedly upmarket Brit. Though women and sex are typically no more than hasty afterthoughts in the crime caper Lilys no bit player. Indeed she and Jake make better partners than lovers. With his shifty deep-set eyes and offhand detachment Burns has never made a convincing romantic lead. But he does very nicely as a shyster and his mischievous performance more than makes up for the dippy movies hes inflicted on us as a director. Much of the movies pleasure comes from the chemistry between the suave inscrutable Jake and Hoffmans dementedly excitable crime boss for which the actor draws on both Ratzo Rizzo and the Rain Man. Following a promising start with the Jim Thompson adaptation After Dark My Sweet Foley has had a checkered career. His elegant but dry work in Glengarry Glen Ross based on the virtually unadaptable David Mamet play gave way to a bunch of forgettable films. (Anyone remember Two Bits? The Chamber? The Corrupter?) If nothing else Confidence ought to confirm Foley as a master of neo-noir with an amused eye to the parallels between grifting and making movies. Though Foley and Jung arent the first to make such comparisons they understand better than most that when it comes to good scams and movies its style -- the how more than the what -- that separates the sheep from the goats. The insight like the movie is hardly profound but the execution is exquisitely controlled. Confidence grooves on the giddy joy of storytelling -- on the digressive whimsy of good dialogue on playful editing on the ways in which con men -- and filmmakers -- psych out their victims. The movie reels us in plays to our baser instincts invites our trust flatters our skepticism and pays us out again at the precise moment our guard is let down. No matter that in a genre thats been done to death theres really nothing new to say about the nexus of money and mistrust that is the American way of doing business legit or otherwise. By the end when a slew of scams has been artfully tied together in a neat bow the movie leaves us awash in something approaching post-coital delight. We know weve been used and weve loved every minute of it. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm In People I Know a glum and muddled effort about the unholy marriage of politics and celebrity Al Pacino plays Eli Wurman a once prominent New York publicist whose star has faded to the point where he has only one bankable client Cary Launer (Ryan ONeal) a feckless airhead whos weighing a run for the Senate. Pacino -- hollow-eyed his hair carefully teased into dishevelment and laboring under a Southern accent that brings back painful memories of Scent of a Woman -- staggers around doing a stoned variant of his endless supply of doomed rent-a-wrecks. Even then the actor might be fun to watch were he not being asked to stand in for the Tragic Death of the 60s. A Georgia Jew who once marched with Martin Luther King Jr. Eli reinvented himself after the civil rights era as a Manhattan kingmaker helping to lay the foundations of a world -- a pricey blend of Hollywood political hopefuls and starstruck tycoons among others -- that has now discarded him like a used match. Disillusioned but not yet in despair Eli is making a last-ditch effort to stay afloat honestly by staging an all-star benefit for Nigerian immigrants who are about to be deported under the house-cleaning operations of New Yorks cowboy mayor (guess who?). For this he needs Launers presence as well as that of an Al Sharpton-like Harlem minister (Bill Nunn) and Elliot Sharansky a philanthropically inclined Jewish businessman played by The West Wings congenitally impassive Richard Schiff. As the movie opens Launer whos been threatening to fire Eli asks him to baby-sit a temperamental starlet named Jilli Hopper (played with some desperation by a woefully miscast Tea Leoni) for the evening. After bailing Jilli out of jail Eli reluctantly accompanies her back to the high-profile party where she was arrested to retrieve a computer toy she left there. The place turns out to be a sex-and-opium den for high rollers and later that night Eli fogged by this and other drugs overprescribed by his physician (comedian Robert Klein) looks on helplessly as Jilli is doped raped and -- it will later transpire -- murdered in her hotel suite leaving Eli in possession of the toy in which all manner of unexpected people are taking an unhealthy interest. Directed by Dan Algrant from a script by playwright Jon Robin Baitz People I Know is awkwardly derivative both in subject and noirish ambiance of Alexander Mackendricks far more pungent 1957 Sweet Smell of Success. Clifford Odets adapting Ernest Lehmans novel was out to lift the lid on a corrupt world but he had both an amused appetite for its excesses and an unflinching moral sensibility. People I Know is chilly and humorless fueled by the cynical belief -- a creeping affliction among some former 60s leftists who can no longer find a flag to hoist -- that power corrupts everyone who wields it. For all its knowing veneer the movie is politically crude and undiscriminating. The dishonest and the decadent pile up -- not just tycoons and pols but rabbis reverends and ACLU bigwigs are implicated until theres no one left ethically intact but Eli and a rather redundant sister-in-law (Kim Basinger looking tres Hepburn) who blows in from the South to lure him back to a simpler nobler life. As a thriller People I Know -- which has languished unreleased since 2001 -- is barely plausible. As a critique of the meshing of power politics between East and West coasts the movie is more smart-alecky than wise. And as the human face of Tony Curtis venal conniving press agent in Sweet Smell of Success Eli Wurman is less than convincing. When all is said and done a public relations flack seems an odd choice to represent the spirit of the 60s let alone its death knell.

Director James Foley weighs in with one of his more commercial entries with the smartly executed ""Confidence"" which highlights an elaborate sting pulled by a team of slick operators who may or may not be looking to scam each other. While it doesnt quite match the panache and humor of Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans Eleven"" which it resembles in many ways it is a stylish compelling crime caper full of smoothly navigated plot twists. Distinguished by an electric supporting turn from Dustin Hoffman in an uncharacteristic role the Lions Gate release should perform solidly within the genres parameters when it hits theaters in April. Doug Jungs tightly planned script opens with the body of Jake Vig (Ed Burns) lying on a Los Angeles street in a pool of blood and explaining in voiceover how he got there. Rewind to three weeks earlier as a con job goes down landing Jake and his crew thousands when the terrified mark scrams during a heated weapons standoff. But when the mark and one of Jakes team turn up dead it emerges that the swindled man was an accountant for eccentric crime boss King (Hoffman). Knowing its only a matter of time before King gets to them Jake goes to him first at his nightclub. He explains the unintentional error in judgment and agrees to repay the money by pulling off a major con. In this and the handful of other scenes in which hes featured Hoffman gives a wickedly sharp prickly performance that ranks among his best in years. Creating a bracing alternative to the standard crime kingpin the actor juggles irritation with amusement and admiration for the charming upstart who refuses to be intimidated by him. Keeping the threat of physical violence low but nonetheless perceptible he flirts playfully with Jake while establishing whos boss and at the same time auditions a lesbian sister act as if he were Flo Ziegfeld. King insists the swindle be pulled on criminally connected banker and money launderer Morgan Price (Robert Forster) considered an impossible target. The crime boss sends his henchman Lupus (Frankie G) to join Jakes crew and monitor the job firsthand. In addition to regular partners Gordo (Paul Giamatti) and Miles (Brian Van Holt) and two crooked cops (Donal Logue and Luis Guzman) also on the payroll Jake enlists sexy pickpocket Lily (Rachel Weisz) to pull off a complicated scam involving corporate loans and offshore wire transfers. Signs of bad luck soon follow and further trouble surfaces in the form of Gunther Butan (Andy Garcia) a disheveled federal agent long after Jake. While theres nothing significantly new going on here Foleys polished direction and Jungs clever script expertly stack enough multiple deceptions and surprise turnabouts to keep the action ticking. The increasingly complex mechanics of the scheme are elaborated with clarity and dexterity and the audience is kept guessing about the trustworthiness and loyalties of the shifty characters. Stylistic touches like direct-to-camera dialogue and graphic inserts at times seem a little gratuitous and derivative. D.p. Juan Ruiz-Anchia supplies plenty of visual muscle with his sinuous camera moves and lightning pans matched with Stuart Levys nimble editing. Cool electronic tunes complete the sleek package. While he lacks the movie star charisma to make Jake the truly dynamic magnetic force he should be Burns has more spark here than usual and his handsome looks and relaxed self-assurance fit the bill. Giamatti gets a generous share of the scripts sharpest dialogue while Brit thesp Weisz registers as savvy and seductive and Garcia brings an appealing smirk to his small role as a slob with some surprises up his sleeve.
