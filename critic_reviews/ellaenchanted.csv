Ella Enchanted based on a best-selling childrens book really wants to be different - for example it features an elf (Aidan McArdle) who dreams of being a lawyer and has a fling with a giant - but in this post-Pixar world the stakes have been upped in the world of childrens entertainment animated or otherwise. Quite simply we now expect more attention to detail sharper gags and greater irreverence from our kids films. Anne Hathaway plays Ella a girl blessed with an unfortunate gift that makes her unable to disobey an order. When her evil stepmother (Joanna Lumley) and stepsisters (Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham) cotton on to this and start making all manner of unspeakable demands Ellas life becomes unbearable and she sets off in search of a fairy who can put her right pausing only to fall in love with princely pin-up Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy) and to sing a rousing verion of Queens Somebody to Love along the way. The message is simple - free will and equality are very good things although not so good that they should stop you marrying into the royal family given half a chance - and Hathaway is game enough but it feels a little forced. It tries too hard. Expect the target audience to watch it once smile then go back to their DVDs of Shrek and The Princess Bride.

While the mix is as uneven as the performance styles the glue that holds the sweet teen-fantasy together is star Anne Hathaway who continues to evolve into a luminous young lead. A romantic fairy tale with a contempo pop culture sensibility ""Ella Enchanted"" draws from the well of everything from ""The Princess Bride"" to ""Ever After"" from ""Shrek"" to ""A Knights Tale"" in its bid to sell medieval mores to mall-rats. While the mix is as uneven as the performance styles the glue that holds the sweet teen-fantasy together is star Anne Hathaway who continues to evolve into a luminous young lead. Gail Carson Levines original novel was much loved by young girls who should flock to this disarming Miramax adaptation though it lacks the edge to encroach on more adult markets. As anyone whos read the impassioned email exchanges on the Web sparked by casting news and by the films trailer will know fans of Levines book are fiercely opinionated over any tampering with a story that clearly struck chords with pre-teen readers. Those devotees may be hostile to the liberties taken by a committee of screenwriters that includes the ""Legally Blonde"" team of Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith. Chief among the films innovations is the choice to contemporize aspects of the story and language with references to medieval teen mags and fan clubs a shopping mall replete with hand-cranked escalators a predominantly 70s-retro soundtrack and period damsels spouting lines like ""Bite me"" and ""Cool trick."" The filmmakers also pushed the tone into a far more jokey comic realm which dilutes the romantic-magical chemistry of the book downplaying its central idea of a ""Cinderella"" overhaul. Opening with some rumination about fairy tales director Tommy OHaver (""Billys Hollywood Screen Kiss"") wades through some voiceover-heavy exposition but settles on an agreeably breezy tone once the title characters mission becomes clear -- and once she assumes the teenage form of Hathaway. That mission stems from the tradition in the kingdom of Frell that each newborn child is given a gift by a fairy godmother. One such benefactress Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) endowed Ella (Hathaway) with the gift of obedience which turns out to be more of a curse. When Ellas widowed father (Patrick Bergin) remarries shrewish Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley) the girls compulsion to do exactly as shes told makes her a helpless pawn in the hands of her stepmothers wicked daughters Hattie and Olive (Lucy Punch Jennifer Higham). The animosity of those period-frocked Hilton sisters is stoked when royal heartthrob Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy) passes through town and Ella catches his eye. Chars uncle Edgar (Cary Elwes) has cared for the lad since the mysterious death of his father and is only marginally less sinister than his CGI pet snake Heston (voiced by Steve Coogan). Edgar has made the kingdom an unjust place enslaving its elves giants and ogres. When cruel Hattie and Olive cost their stepsister her best friend (Parminder K. Nagra) Ella sets off to find Lucinda and have her take back the obedience curse. Ellas clumsy nanny Mandy (Minnie Driver) gives her a book for guidance in which the latters boyfriend Benny (Jimi Mistry) has been trapped by a spell gone awry. They are joined on their journey by Slannen (Aidan McArdle) an elf wanting to become a lawyer. Levines book kept a steady focus on Ellas empowering quest to lift the obedience curse while the overly processed script here embellishes her personal journey with numerous diversions and a political agenda. In ""Wizard of Oz"" fashion the film also makes transient characters from the book into tag-alongs during Ellas trek through the kingdom and invents villains (Edgar and Heston). OHavers most amusing touches are the musical inserts notably an interlude in Giantville during which Ella is instructed to entertain a wedding party with a song. Underlining the cross-epochal similarity with ""A Knights Tale"" which also prominently featured a hit by Brit group Queen Ella launches into a rousing version of ""Somebody to Love"" -- spiritedly sung by Hathaway -- that may be the films high point. As she did in ""The Princess Diaries"" Hathaway lights up the screen. A thoroughly charming performer with a bracing freshness about her that carries the film the actress establishes credible chemistry with Brit thesp Dancy (""Black Hawk Down"") who makes a serviceably sweet natured sensitive hunk. Around the core couple however the film indulges in the Miramax tendency to throw in name actors regardless of their being right for the role. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" star Nagra is barely used as is Driver whose character is upgraded from a plump hag in the book. Fox seems to be in another movie and supermodel Heidi Klum should be exiled back to the catwalk based on her wooden appearance here as a giantess besotted with diminutive Slannen -- a direct rip-off of the donkey-dragon tryst from ""Shrek."" Lumley and Elwes give unrestrained pantomime perfs the latter stopping just short of twirling his moustache while Punch and Higham are like nauseating sitcom teens. Visuals -- including Norman Garwoods colorful production design and Ruth Myers period costumes graced with 1960s and 70s flourishes -- are plenty vibrant and the Irish locations are handsomely captured by John de Bormans sweeping camera. Visual effects are refreshingly low-tech particularly in the Giantville scenes which resemble ""Elf"" in their old-fashioned perspective tricks. But the heavy CGI component seems undernourished and often poorly integrated giving the underpopulated pic an artificial look and hinting that the material might have been better served by deluxe Disney treatment.

"`Ella is less than enchanting - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW `Ella is less than enchanting By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 9 2004 One of the smaller hard lessons a modern child faces is realizing that the people who make movies often have no idea what theyre doing. ""Ella Enchanted"" the 1997 book by Gail Carson Levine is by all accounts a classy nimbly written satire of fairy tales that serves as an exemplary fairy tale itself. ""Ella Enchanted"" the movie is an overcalculated fusion of ""Shrek"" and ""The Princess Bride"" with all the smarts replaced by smartass. It appears to be based on the book in the same way that mammals are based on land.At least the cast is engaging and familiar although the actors have been coached to flail around the cheap-looking sets. Anne Hathaway (""The Princess Diaries"") she of saucer eye and amiable demeanor is Ella of Frell who at birth was given the gift of obedience by a well-meaning fairy named Lucinda (Viveca A. Fox shaking her boo-tay in a misguided homegirl turn). This unfortunately means that when someone says ""Bite me"" -- and in this movie they do -- Ella does.Ellas mother dies and her penniless nobleman father (Patrick Bergin) marries the horrid Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley of ""Absolutely Fabulous"") who comes with the appropriately horrid daughters (Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham). Flitting around the action is Mandy (Minnie Driver) the familys domestic housefairy who acts more like a guest who arrived 20 years ago and never left.More plot The kingdom is ruled by the villainous Prince Regent Edgar (Cary Elwes the one-time Westley of the very far away ""Princess Bride"") who has enslaved the giants exiled the ogres and forced the elves into dinner theater. This is almost as funny as it sounds. The future king is Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy) who is chased about the realm by screaming hordes of teenage girls and who is clueless to his evil uncles machinations up to and including the poisoned crown.And even more plot Ella desperate to be rid of her ""gift"" searches the kingdom for Lucinda acquiring on her journey a talking book that contains Mandys enchanted boyfriend (Jimi Mistry) a disgruntled elf who wants to be a lawyer (Aidan McArdle) and Prince Charmont to whom she teaches sociopolitical responsibility and with whom she falls in love.All this and many many jokes about medieval shopping malls. The makers of ""Ella Enchanted"" -- including the writing team behind ""Legally Blonde"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You"" -- seem cowed by such recent phenomena as ""Lizzie McGuire"" and Lindsay Lohan and have thus retrofitted the script with as much jokey postmodern sass as the slender story can bear. It might even work if the pop-culture references -- Crockery Barn stores Bat-Ox injections -- werent so tepid. Even the kitschy 1970s music nuggets on the soundtrack feel pandering; when Hathaway whips off her gown at the end to reveal a miniskirt and boogie down to a strident version of ""Dont Go Breaking My Heart"" you cringe for the actress.Shes not the only one left stranded. Lumley Driver Elwes and Eric Idle (as the onscreen narrator) play it broad and silly while Parminder K. Nagra the star of ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is wasted in an insultingly tiny heroines-best-pal role. McArdle scores some laughs as the petulant elf but even he has to suffer the indignity of getting farted off a bench by a giant.The problem is that even good timely humor requires a film to relinquish its potential for timelessness. I admit I havent read the book but I have a daughter and a wife who have and who came to the screening with me and let me tell you they are ticked. Some preliminary nosing around on the Web suggests theyre not alone The wholesale changes wrought by the producers on Levines characters and plot -- let alone any larger message of think-for-yourself empowerment -- are engendering the sort of preteen disgust reserved these days for Britney Spears.The producers of ""Ella Enchanted"" probably assume correctly that many more kids havent read the book than have and theyre out to give that audience a slick shallow good time. They forget that you dont have to have read a book to recognize a sell-out when you see it. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Starring Anne Hathaway Joanna Lumley Hugh Dancy Aidan McArdle Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham. Directed by Tommy OHaver. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Suppose Picasso had decided during his Cubist period to paint the Cinderella story. The familiar elements -- the heroine her sinister stepfamily Prince Charming the glass slipper -- would be on the canvas somewhere but tipped over and looking freaky. Something similar goes on in ""Ella Enchanted"" a lively deconstruction of the hoary fairy tale. The movie doesnt aspire to be art merely to entertain adolescent girls which is practically guaranteed by the luminous presence of Anne Hathaway -- the teen sets Julia Roberts -- in the title role. But ""Ella"" is artful enough to intrigue adults and far more original than other versions of Cinderella portrayed onscreen with alarming regularity. At this rate the line ""someday my prince will come"" will soon be amended to ""take my prince please."" ""Ella Enchanted"" avoids the mistake of other movies of its ilk that were updated to the present. Thats too great a stretch for a story beginning with ""once upon a time."" It belongs in the ancient time of our imaginations inhabited by magic-wand-wielding fairy godmothers and spells that dont require talking over with a shrink. While rooted in a distant past the movie based on a best-selling childrens novel by Gail Carson Levine borrows liberally and amusingly from other time periods and cultures. Martial art scenes appear to be inspired by ""The Matrix."" The prince Char (a clever abbreviation of both charming and the first name of that English royal) appears frequently on the cover of Medieval Teen. Its hard not to smile at the idea of such a magazine. Char (Hugh Dancy) is a hunk who could have his choice of any female in his domain. An allusion is made to his cute butt about as racy as this determinably PG-rated movie gets. Char falls for Ella and its easy to see why. Hathaway brings her special spark and maturity to what could have been a sappy role. Dancy a stage-trained British actor like many in this smartly cast movie appears royal without ever being smug. He and Hathaway have an innocent kind of chemistry -- you can imagine them necking but never proceeding any further. Director Tommy OHaver has a feel for the humor in romance as he demonstrated in ""Billys Hollywood Screen Kiss."" This racy gay comedy is a far cry from ""Ella"" except that both have the ability to enchant. As in any romantic comedy there has to be an obstacle in the lovers way. Here its a spell Ella was put under at birth to obey every command like a puppy stuck in obedience school. Her wicked stepsisters played with campy abandon by Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham soon discover Ellas Achilles heel and use it to humiliate her. Joanna Lumley of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" is equally shrill and demeaning as the mean stepmom who married Ellas dad for his title without knowing that circumstances had reduced him to selling watches for a living. A glass slipper comes into play -- not in its traditional guise as a way to take the measure of the true Cinderella -- but as an item for sale at a local bazaar. Ellas ersatz siblings order her to steal the shoe. Ella might have successfully escaped with it except that when shes commanded to halt she does so right in midair. Ellas attempt to break loose from her debilitating spell brings her in contact with an elf played by screen newcomer Aidan McArdle in a rousing theatrical performance. This elf has a problem -- he aspires to be a lawyer but is consigned to fairy-tale hell where elves are only allowed to entertain. In one of the movies smooth segues into a musical number hes suddenly surrounded by his dancing and singing kin who break into a rendition of ""Let Me Entertain You."" Theres also a lovely giantess who resents that giants always are portrayed as stomping monsters who are ugly to boot. The Brothers Grimm are personally held responsible for these stereotypes. It takes a special imagination to make into villains the authors of stories that generations of children grew up on. Five screenwriters are credited with the ""Ella"" script. So many hands usually kill creativity but in this case they appear to have sparked it. Either that or ""Ella Enchanted"" is under a magical spell of its own.

It has a few moments of fun and whimsy but it lacks the joyous spirit and intelligent humor of the childrens novel on which its based. In its attempt to fuse a fairy-tale fantasy with a modern sensibility the movie winds up a corny derivative mishmash. Anne Hathaway pulls her Princess Diaries costumes out of the closet for Ella Enchanted. By David Appleby Miramax Films With its substantial deviations from the original story by Gail Carson Levine Ella will prove disappointing to many young fans of the book but not enough of a hit with those unfamiliar with the novel. As a baby Ella (played by the likable Anne Hathaway) was cursed with the ""gift of obedience"" by an evil fairy. Translation Anything anyone tells her to do she must do. As she matures this curse grows more wearisome. Still she remains feisty and upbeat aided by a caring godmother. The novels fairy godmother with frizzy gray hair and a couple of chins has been transformed by Hollywood into a much younger more glamorous and decidedly duller Minnie Driver. The playful and intelligent Prince Charmont has morphed on screen into an empty-headed teen idol. Hugh Dancy plays the handsome prince adored by girls the kingdom over. Ella is too busy with political causes such as protesting discrimination against elves and giants to pay much attention to the heartthrob prince. But they meet in an unlikely way and the prince proves not as superficial as he seems. ABOUT THE MOVIE Ella Enchanted   (out of four) Stars Anne Hathaway Hugh Dancy Minnie Driver Cary Elwes Director Tommy OHaver Distributor Mirimax Films Rating PG for some crude humor and language Opens Friday nationwide This Cinderella-inspired tale has the requisite evil stepmother and nasty vapid stepsisters. Plus Ella must expose the princes uncle (Cary Elwes) as a conniving ruler who uses the prince as his pawn. Hathaways Everygirl persona works well as Ella an idealistic and heroic tough cookie. The witty narration by Eric Idle is a clever counterpoint to the fantastical look of the kingdom of Frell. But the music and a couple of dance sequences are jarring. Leo Sayers You Make Me Feel Like Dancing and Elton John and Kiki Dees Dont Go Breaking My Heart cant be any kids idea of a cool pop-rock soundtrack. And do the filmmakers really think young girls -- the movies target audience -- will be charmed by the sight of hulking ogres whose pants slip off their bottoms? Or by leaden one-liners? (An elf laments ""Im going to need so much therapy after this"" following a fight with a team of knights.) Theres a superficial political correctness to Ella Enchanted that smacks of trying too hard to please all audiences. It feels as if the movie was vetted by too many focus groups with conflicting agendas.
