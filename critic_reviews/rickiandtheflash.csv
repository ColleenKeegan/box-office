Academy Award winning actors Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline headline the cast while Oscar winners Jonathan Demme and Diablo Cody handle the directing and screenwriting tasks.  Yet despite the embarrassment of riches Ricki and the Flash never quite reaches the heights one might expect from browsing the credits. Its an entertaining diversion - a good way to pass a couple of hours as late summer evenings lengthen - but not much more. Due in large part to helming The Silence of the Lambs Demme is known as a dark edgy filmmaker. Over the course of his career however he has directed dramatic movies like 1994s Philadelphia and 2008s Rachel Getting Married. Ricki and the Flash is a cousin to the latter telling the kind family-oriented story that has fallen into disfavor in an era when interpersonal interaction has become unpopular with studios focused on making a big box office splash. Cody known for her biting irreverent dialogue (she won her Oscar for Juno) tones things down considerably. Ricki and the Flash contains a few zingers but for the most part its low-key. This represents a reunion for Kevin Kline and Meryl Streep who were paired as lovers in 1982s Sophies Choice. Here the material is less wrenching. Streep is Linda a sixty-ish rock singer who fronts a house band Ricki and the Flash at a L.A. bar. Her career has long since peaked (and she wasnt that big even when ""on top"") but she keeps at it because thats who she is. Her pursuit of music has left a lot of roadkill in the rearview mirror an ex-husband Pete (Kline) and three children - Julie (Maime Gummer) Josh (Sebastian Stan) and Adam (Nick Westrate). Her present isnt wreathed in glory - she makes ends meet by working as a cashier at a supermarket and rebuffs the advances of her smitten bandmate Greg (Rick Springfield).  Then she gets the call from Indianapolis. Julie after being dumped by her husband has tried to kill herself. Now shes holed up in a bedroom in Petes palatial estate and wont come out. With his wife (Audra McDonald) away caring for an ailing father Pete has nowhere to turn but Linda who makes the trip to offer what help she can. Her first encounter with her daughter doesnt go well - long-buried recriminations pour forth - but the two manage to form a fragile bond over the next few days.  Things dont go as well with Lindas other children. Josh is willing to engage with her but Adam would prefer to avoid all but the most superficial contact. To the films credit it doesnt wallow in the melodrama of the situation. Yes Ricki and the Flash is about redemption but its not about a woman making amends for the wrongs she committed against her children. Instead its about her trying to reconnect with them as adults and create a new relationship. The key sentiment is voiced by Greg ""Its not our kids job to love us. Its our job to love them. Were their parents."" The movie is mature in the way it handles the regrets of absentee parents and the ways in which their children relate to them. Theres a little Hollywood artifice here but not so much that the emotions feel inauthentic. Demme who in 1984 directed one of the all-time great concert films Stop Making Sense devotes a surprising amount of screen time to performances by Ricki and the Flash. With a repertoire of mostly covers they sing and play their way through several full songs (including Tom Pettys ""American Girl"" and Bruce Springsteens ""My Love Will Not Let You Down"") and parts of a few others. In Mamma Mia Streep revealed that she could carry a tune and in Ricki and the Flash she does all her own singing. (Nice to have Rick Springfield as a backup.) The acting is of course top-notch. Although Streep seemingly gets an obligatory annual Oscar nomination any such acknowledgment in 2016 probably wont come for Ricki and the Flash. Shes solid here but the performance isnt flashy enough. In fact she is out-acted by both her real-life daughter Maime Gummer (playing her on-screen daughter) and perhaps surprisingly by Springfield. Known best as an 80s pop icon Springfield has developed into a credible actor. August is a month when misfit movies make their way into multiplexes - titles that lack the prestige necessary to compete in the fall Oscar race but are too ""small"" to make it in the early summer. That description fits Ricki and the Flash. Its a warm story of a fractured family reuniting and finding a way to forge a path forward but the quality of the cast and crew elevates the material. Theres a ceiling for this sort of drama however and while Ricki and the Flash bumps against it it cant quite crash through.

By Peter Rainer Film critic August 7 2015 Save for later Saved Musician Ricki Rendazzo (Meryl Streep) attempts to reconnect with her estranged grown children for a family wedding in Ricki and the Flash. Bob Vergara/Courtesy of Sony Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Meryl Streep plays a rhythm guitarist and rock-band frontwoman in Jonathan Demmes ""Ricki and the Flash."" She not only does her own singing but also her own guitar playing. After all the awards Streep has won for acting I guess she felt it was high time to cop a Grammy.Strutting around for most of the film in her leather rocker duds Streeps Ricki Rendazzo is almost as much of a concoction as her witch in ""Into the Woods."" She wears her uniform as a taunt and also as a way of defining herself. Shes a woman out of time - a superannuated hippie.She mostly lives from hand to mouth as a supermarket cashier in Los Angeles while also fronting her band the Flash in a San Fernando Valley bar where the regulars like the band members are well past their prime. When her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) now a prosperous Indianapolis businessman calls to tell her that their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps real-life daughter) has gone off the deep end following a sudden marital breakup Ricki accepts Petes plea to pay a visit and cool things down. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Pete and Ricki who also have two sons the about-to-be-married Joshua (Sebastian Stan) and the openly gay Adam (Nick Westrate) have long since parted - and they seem to occupy different universes. Rickis grungy world is hardscrabble and working-class; Pete who has happily remarried lives in a spacious mansion. When Ricki shows up the air is immediately thickened with familial hostility. The children resent Ricki for essentially abandoning them for her career. Petes wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) when she eventually arrives on the scene soon enough joins the anti-Ricki contingent. (The face-off between her and Ricki full of verbal jabs and counterjabs is the best written scene in the movie.) The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide For the most part the movies seethings and squabblings are reminiscent of umpteen other films about families gone wild. The screenwriter Diablo Cody (""Juno"") doesnt bring anything terribly distinctive to the mix. Despite Streeps best efforts Ricki seems more of a contrivance than a flesh-and-blood character. She stomps around in her rocker duds but Ricki is essentially sentimentalized - shes a stand-in for all the other superannuated hippies out there in the audience.The film does have the cachet of pitting Streep and her own daughter against each other and Gummer proves she can match her mothers formidability in battle. Kline is playing an officious type but he does provide a few much-needed moments when the free spirit he once was peeks through.Given the grinding sameness of the interfamily dynamics its perhaps no accident that Demme overloads the film with concert sequences featuring the Flash. (Rickis lovelorn band mate played by real-life rocker Rick Springfield is in the film to light a few sparks.) Demme has directed some of the greatest music documentaries ever made including the Talking Heads classic ""Stop Making Sense"" so footage of the Flash here makes sense. But too often I felt as if I were watching a demo reel of the band.Demme doesnt just give us snippets of the bands concerts he offers up - especially in the big overblown wedding party finale - extended play. At times I found myself asking ""Hey what happened to the other movie?"" (Its the same problem I had with Demmes ""Rachel Getting Married."") Demme seems happiest here filming the Flash. But the Flash is not exactly the Talking Heads and giving over so much of the movie to the band only points up what a mixed bag everything else is.

"Rocks Off Streep Goes Electric Fantastic Four Goes Pffft << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Rocks Off Streep Goes Electric Fantastic Four Goes Pffft Sony Pictures Entertainment Movies August 7 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Ive never seen a movie try to be as right-thinking as Ricki and the Flash and still be so wrong. It keeps telling you it loves everybody and has a giant heart and that those sentiments are more important than anything the screenwriter or director did. The big straight wedding is catered by really helpful lesbians OK? So lay off Its not that I dont believe that the filmmakers mean well. Its just that they dont think its pitiful enough that decades ago selfish old Ricki Rendazzo left her husband and three kids to chase rock-and-roll stardom that never came and that all the chasing amounted to was a now-out-of-print album from the 1980s called Silk Night Sky. Its not enough to make Ricki toil drearily as a cashier at a fake Whole Foods and stand over a small stove in a small kitchen pushing food around a frying pan. No no. She has to perform in Tarzana California and Ricki cant even be her real name. Its ... Linda Brummell. Nor does it suffice to have Ricki do covers in one of those watering holes thats half-empty but whose patrons are all painfully enthusiastic. Its that she and the boys in her band (the Flash) must follow a mandate to do more contemporary hits and so here comes Lady Gagas ""Bad Romance."" (Its like a bar youd find in Clear Channel California.) And because alas Ricki -- poor super-duper-down-on-her-luck Ricki -- is played by Meryl Streep her version of ""Bad Romance"" cant simply be a cover. It has to be a trudge among the Stations of the Cross. Once more Streeps going for maximum authenticity. She sings and plays guitar alongside professional musicians including Rick Springfield as Greg the Flashs lead guitarist whose boyfriendly affection practically gives Ricki hives. And Streep couldnt have just played some washed-up never-was. She has to give it blockbuster oomph. The hair alone is a thing long blonde and swept to one side brown on the side thats exposed with three or four plaits on her shoulder and bangs through which she can glower. She is clad in leather and rings and bracelets and tights and boots with a guitar slung over her back and you dont know whether shes ready to rock or colonize Middle-earth. All of that hard style is meant to clash with the soft domesticity that the movie plunks Ricki into. She gets a call from her limp ex Pete (Kevin Kline) informing her that a recent divorce has pushed their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) off the rails. She scrapes her way to Indiana and Petes gated village which contains a spacious house that drops Rickis jaw. Symbolism ensues Shes more affectionate to the state-of-the-art refrigerator than she ever is to Greg. That would seem to explain Rickis signature original song whose rueful refrain is ""Im a cold one."" After some awkward pleasantries between her and Pete Julie spills down from her bedroom like floodwater and proceeds to douse Ricki in bile. Knowing that Gummer is Streeps biological daughter isnt required. You can tell theyre related because Gummers hair wants an Oscar too. For three or four scenes its stage-crazy pointing in 300 different directions. Gummer is a smart intuitive actor who some of us have appreciated for years and it looks as if this might be her movie for one or two scenes. She gets to do a lot of huffing and puffing but right before she can blow down the house the movie puts the character in a corner and barely lets her back in on the presiding action. The film which Diablo Cody wrote and Jonathan Demme directed is a work of bulk-size bogusness. Barely a single scene is convincing. When Julie deluges into the kitchen shes wearing an X concert T-shirt. Who put that on her? Julies breakup is a pretext for Cody to manufacture fireworks elsewhere like between Ricki and her two sons one of whom Adam (Nick Westrate) is gay and the other Josh (Sebastian Stan) whom is engaged to a horridly prim woman (Hailey Gates) who doesnt want Ricki at the wedding. The kids lives are news to Ricki. Everything about her family is. Naturally this all comes to a head at family dinner set at one of those uptight white-tablecloth university-club-style restaurants where the outburst appalls the surrounding uptight diners. Its an embarrassing scene in which almost everybody gets to grandstand but Cody and Demme put the already-rickety sequence on dangerously wobbly legs. Adam gets to say of Ricki ""Oh my god shes parenting. Somebody bring a camera."" And Streep just rocks forward and engorges her eyes like a woman who cant believe this scene either. At this point Streep is a victim of her virtuosity. People cant quite see her clearly enough to know whether she can do wrong or do better. When Ricki and the Flash ended the guy to my right leaned over to his seatmate and said whats basically become a motto ""Meryl Streep can do anything."" Id add including get away with murder which shes been doing a lot lately in The Iron Lady August Osage County and Into the Woods movies with moviemaking feeble enough to convince some people that theyre seeing everlasting genius. Still shes an artist and will do whats necessary to make a part hers. Here that appears to entail playing whatever it is that made the character write a ballad in which she compares herself to a beer. Sony Pictures Entertainment Whether the news is good or awful Rickis life as a girlfriend and mother is one long ""Why didnt you tell me?"" Its entirely reactive. What Ricki does know besides the lyrics to ""Wooly Bully"" are the price codes for stuff like milk and organic bananas. The scene in which she discloses that is the best in the movie. Ricki and Pete are stoned for it. Shes sitting on the counter with cookie dough and a spoon and Petes struggling to disobey his dominant starchiness. Its not that the writing is particularly good here. Its that with Gummer asleep in the other room Streep and Kline are reaching into their personal and professional friendship to create a crackle of warmth between two pieces of cardboard. It feels like cheating but who cares? Suddenly two actors finally seem as if theyve got something interesting to play. But that scene is also one in a long line of moments in which Cody and Demmes pursuit of normal people experiencing normal emotion turns up one condescension after the next. Take Petes current wife Maureen. Shes the one thing everybodys always bragging to Ricki about. Played by Audra McDonald shes a saintly doctor whos right there waiting for a heart-to-heart when Ricki emerges from the shower. The movie would never make a big deal that Maureen is black. You have eyes though and she does mention it. And McDonald spends this scene with Streep with a rag on her head lecturing Ricki about how its Maureen who raised the kids after Ricki walked out on them. In the scene before it Maureens first shes serving breakfast. No one means anything by any of this. In the movies imagination and given her career and poise and centrality to the family Maureen is the most powerful person in the film. But its nominal power. She barely has three scenes. And its a touch nutty that youd cast a theater icon who just won her sixth Tony (for playing Billie Holiday) in a quasi-musical in which Meryl Streep does all the singing. You know Demme means well by Maureen and the women playing the lesbian caterers and by having the late session musician Rick Rosas and the keyboard legend Bernie Worrell round out the Flash. But its the worst kind of diversification since all this color signals is support help. It doesnt feel great to doubt Demme. Hes a good filmmaker whos lost his way. He gets the benefit of the doubt because hes one of the good guys. Its not only because he enjoyed a terrific decade-or-so stretch of pop movies and solid hits from Melvin and Howard Stop Making Sense and Something Wild to The Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia. Its also because the movies had a strange energy and visual intelligence. There was an artists sensibility behind them. He also gets the benefit of the doubt because he has taken up the cause of social justice and likes what were forced to call ""world music."" But some of us have been waiting for that passion for equal rights and representation to show up somewhere other than in his documentaries and beyond the periphery of his fiction. (Its true that he remade The Manchurian Candidate with Streep Denzel Washington and Kimberly Elise but that was a movie in which the government turned Washington into a killing machine to make some white lady president.) For me Demmes progressive vision culminated with The Truth About Charlie a remake of Charade that came and went in 2002. Mark Wahlberg was the star but only nominally. Demme had managed to staff the movie with a significant parade of nonwhite actors and was pointing a way forward that at the time seemed to me to be electric and incontrovertible. He made something like world music seem borderless and antinational -- like the music of the world. The movie was only so-so as a thriller but it was utterly persuasive as a global party. Its the best film an American director has made about the sensational collision of cultures without any of the attendant reservations that political correctness causes. It insisted that a black woman was its star and Thandie Newton left no reason to argue. The culture didnt demand any of this; Demme did. Hes the director the only one so far to dare to turn Toni Morrison into cinema with Beloved. His version is widely regarded as a fiasco (its a lot better than that and Newton and Elise are extraordinary). Anyway its not a fiasco most other white guys would have had the empathy imagination or balls to try. But Ricki feels like a sister to his previous family drama Rachel Getting Married right down to its traffic-stopping wedding toast by its heroine. Both movies are written by women and try to treat interracial marriage as a social standard by which we can measure our decency and progress. Neither movie is interested in exploring that standard -- only in congratulating itself for acknowledging that there is one. Here that leads to some almost funny mostly forced scenes for conservative Ricki -- poor embarrassingly conservative Ricki -- to express dismay say over the state of the country under the current president. Not far into the film she harks back to 2008 before things ""went downhill"" then turns to Worrell as her black keyboardist and apologizes. Streep sells the moment better than does Codys writing which has no idea how to give life to the characters Republicanism the way in Young Adult she was able to turn brittle bitchiness into a farce. Demme is selling the humanness of the part. But just like with Rachel Getting Married he seems meek and dutiful caught in the bourgeois liberal weeds. The whole thing is like watching a Nancy Meyers movie do community service.  20th Century Fox When all you ask of a movie is ""why?"" it means not only are the people responsible not trying to give you something great theyre not even trying to give you something you can watch. I took a friend to see Fantastic Four and he threw his arms up enough in disbelief that I was embarrassed to have made him rush uptown from work. My notebook usually remains near my lap but at this movie it made involuntary trips over my mouth to cover all of my gasping. The entire experience is shameful -- for us for the filmmakers for whoever at the studio had the job of creating the ads in which the cast appear to be starring in hostage posters. The movie is all ""why?"" Why do these actors look drugged? Why is one big collection of set pieces staged in front of that boreal screensaver? Why is the other collection set in Ye Olde Science Lab? Why when Reed Richards stretches his arms and legs do they look like somebody overcooked the linguine? Why would anybody paying to see a 100-minute movie about superheroes want to spend more than an hour watching them become those superheroes when most of the same audience watched a version of the same story 10 years ago? (We just finished shrugging off another rebooting of Spider-Man) Why hire Jamie Bell for three scenes then turn him into a mound of steroidal debris? Why do the makers of our comic-book movies keep insisting upon the same government-soaked anticapitalist plot? This time the government comes sniffing after super-scientist Reed Richards (Miles Teller) invents a teleportation device that he hubristically uses to whisk himself two fellow lab buddies -- Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) and Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) -- and his best friend Ben (Jamie Bell) to some distant planet. Something Happens. Most of them make it back infected with new powers that the Pentagon cant wait to weaponize. The crazy surge of electric juice that mutates the boys also flies onto Johnnys sister Sue (Kate Mara) who has powers of both invisibility and absurd blondeness. To mock this movie is to obey a ""Kick Me"" sign. And yet to sit through Fantastic Four is to realize that even a mediocre movie is a kind of miracle. Theres a bar for the superhero adventures and this one falls so far short of it that close study is warranted hopefully by scientists played with more conviction that Teller and Mara. Ive never seen good young actors this stuck. During one ""climactic"" scene Mara has to bang away on a keyboard to make something crucial happen and as I watched her slap away in a rendition of despair I wondered how many takes it took to get that moment so wrong. At some point the quartet all land on Earth and the editor holds the scene so long that the three human characters and the pile of special effects comprising The Thing look lost. The movie which Josh Trank directed and cowrote is hunting for just one triumphant image and never finds it. Its looking for logic in the casting and flubs that too. Reg E. Cathey has a great smokers intonation thats used to remind his black biological son Johnny that hes never had it as easy as his adopted white daughter Sue even though hes the brilliant bad-boy child of a well-compensated scientist who apparently has let him spend his nights combing the streets in a fast car looking for the casting director of the Fast amp; Furious series. When Teller says to the group ""This better work"" you have to remember there was never any discussion of the silly elaborate-looking plan theyre executing to stop Earth from being sucked into a tractor beam. You dont know how no one intervened to say this doesnt make any sense. No sense at all. There are currently two television shows -- Halt and Catch Fire and Mr. Robot -- that not only have titles that sound like Fantastic Four replacements but whose content seems to find moments of anarchic triumph with regularity. This movie has no excuse to be this tepid and yet it doesnt feel as if anyones trying. Trank made Chronicle a found-footage non-comic-book superpowers movie that is generally regarded (by myself included) as innovative at least as a movie about so-called origin stories. That was his first movie. It was largely independent and setting aside reports of his own errant behavior on the set for this second effort its a giant studio contraption that appears to have crushed his imagination. Ironically he might be one of the few young directors sucked into the franchise business whose temperament belongs to the fertile creative space of the margins. Its surprising that more of these houses dont collapse on more untested filmmakers. At every stage of Fantastic Four youre never watching this thing as a movie per se but as a dire cautionary X-ray of one.

But rock and roll as its practiced is often more of an intimate humble pleasure. Such is the case for the band that gives Jonathan Demmes new film Ricki and the Flash its title. The movie opens on them gleefully recreating ""American Girl"" at a dive in Tarzana with both the grizzled musicians and their sparse audience of barflies sharing in the joy of live performance.Related Story Surviving Rock and Roll On Screen Meryl Streeps Ricki were likely meant to think is a certain kind of American girl herself one who chased great ambitions at great cost. Decades ago she left her husband and three young children moving from Indianapolis to LA for stardom that she didnt end up finding. Now she works at a chichi grocery store where her weekly paycheck wouldnt cover the contents of most of the shopping carts she rings up. As a parent shes distant in a way that you rarely see movie mothers be--she missed her daughters wedding is unaware of one sons engagement and still doesnt know her other sons gay.A call from her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) lures her back to the Midwest to help their daughter Julie (Streeps own kid Mamie Gummer) cope with the end of her marriage. There Ricki must face both the contempt of the people she abandoned and the ghost of the life she couldve had. Petes suburban existence is as un-rock-and-roll as it gets but Ricki cant help but be amazed at the shiny appliances and fully stocked fridge in his house. When his current wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) cooks breakfast for the family Ricki takes in the picture of domestic bliss silently shakily before leaving the room.For the early parts of the movie screenwriter Diablo Cody of Juno fame plays the requisite culture clashes as broadly as possible. Ricki is a rock-and-roll Republican trash-talking Obama on stage and sporting a giant patriotic back tattoo. Pete meanwhile is an uptight businessman who owns a poodle named Sigma and lives in a mansion he compares to Monticello. The other Midwesterners who populate the film seem to have fallen through a wormhole from Footloose regarding Rickis fashion and music with open contempt. The family dynamics initially arent very nuanced either. Though Gummers first blast of rage at her mom feels real and scary everyone else talks with a degree of bluntness that rings false; most of the plot development happens through knock-down drag-out confrontations. Thankfully though Streeps character doesnt always say what shes feeling--under her burnout affect is a yearning for forgiveness thats all the more poignant for going unarticulated.Just when the story beats start to feel unbearably obvious the film changes keys becoming less family dramedy than a concert film.But just when the story beats start to feel unbearably obvious--mother/daughter bonding over manicures hints of a reignited flame between divorced spouses an awkward reunion dinner--the film changes keys becoming less family dramedy than a concert film. Demme lets entire songs play out onscreen performed with a surprising degree of sharpness and sensitivity by The Flash. The musics helped along by the fact that Rickis in a blossoming romance with the bands guitarist Greg (real-life rocker Rick Springfield) and their chemistry vests familiar standards like ""Drift Away"" with new emotional power.In the final act the setting and peripheral characters stay somewhat cartoonish but the relationships between the family members mellow in surprising and not-altogether-explained ways. The expected climactic conflict--maybe an emotional breakdown maybe another big fight--never quite materializes. Instead theres a series of limited reconciliations that result more from generosity of spirit than any grand gesture. Its almost as if Demme and Cody having realized that all the dramatic turns the story could have taken would have been cliches just decided to give up and film some songs. Or maybe the idea was simply to provide the kind of rock-and-roll payoff that Rickis band excels at miraculous and small.

Twitter Email previousThats Not FunnynextThe Racial Gaps in Americas Recovery Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 65 Id Like to Hear His Wife Say Something James Fallows None The most personally moving and most fundamentally patriotic moment of the Democratic National Convention was the appearance by the bereaved parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan and the statement about the meaning of their sons life and death and about the Constitution by Mr. Khizr Khan. After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.) Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Entertainment Meryl Streep Has Moves And Parenting Skills Like Jagger In ""Ricki And The Flash"" Streep plays a musician who chose her passion over her family and is still struggling with the fallout. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Rick Springfield and Meryl Streep in Ricki and the Flash. Bob Vergara / Sony Pictures ID 6536872 Ricki Randazzo is the kind of person who thrives in the spotlight who blossoms under it into her brightest most confident self. Thats where we first see her in Ricki and the Flash black boots tapping boho braids flying on stage with her eponymous band digging into Tom Pettys ""American Girl"" like theyre in front of a sold-out arena packed with screaming fans.Theyre actually playing to a half-empty San Fernando Valley dive bar peopled with wizened regulars and some slumming hipsters. That doesnt stop Ricki -- legal name Linda Brummel and played with unmistakable zest by Meryl Streep -- from giving the song her all and bellowing out a rock star-worthy ""Thank you Tarzana"" before dutifully segueing into a cover of Lady Gagas ""Bad Romance"" to please the younger folks in the crowd.Ricki and the Flash is written by Junos Diablo Cody and directed by Jonathan Demme and its marketing has positioned it as a Mom Movie about how a wacky aging rock n roller reunites with her straight-laced children and teaches them to loosen up. The showcased joke a delighted Streep makes about graying muffs is an indicator that the movies saltiness is of a safely low-sodium variety. This isnt untrue necessarily though it undersells the sometimes astringent emotional journey of the movie not to mention its abiding empathy. Ricki is due to make amends not act the saucy not-yet-grandma. And shes actually the one with the conservative streak. View this image > Mamie Gummer Streep and Kevin Kline. Sony Pictures ID 6536887 Yes Ricki and the Flash is less Banger Sisters and more a red-state revisiting of Rachel Getting Married Demmes 2008 family drama in which Anne Hathaway played a self-destructive attention-hungry addict released from rehab for her sisters wedding. Theres a wedding at the end of Ricki too though its in Indianapolis and far less freewheeling an affair than Rachel Getting Marrieds loose-limbed multiculturally utopian nuptials. When Ricki makes her arrival everyone stares at her thrift store dress and leather jacket and whispers behind their hands -- the prodigal parent returns.Ricki is a heartland rocker who votes Republican (""I support our troops"" she retorts) and has a Gadsden flag tattoo on her back. She blithely implies to her infuriated son Adam (Nick Westrate) that he chose to be gay and later compliments the lone Asian man at an event by telling him that he looks just like Bruce Lee (he does not). She is the movies larger-than-life embodiment of the distant relative who makes everyone at the Thanksgiving table squirm by offering a coded explanation for why she thinks her streets gone downhill since the new neighbors moved in. But Rickis outlook while sometimes ignorant is never colored with malice while the embarrassment and unease with which shes treated by members of her family suggests there are some biases people still feel totally comfortable expressing in the open.Rickis wild-card politics are a prime indicator of how the divisions in Ricki and the Flash are less straightforward than one party being liberated and laid-back and the other uptight and repressed. Theyre at least as much if not more about class in that Rickis choices and aspirations have shunted her into a blue-collar life in which she shows up in a cab she has no money to pay for. When her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline daddishly dignified) calls her back to Indiana to support their daughter Julie (actual Streep offspring Mamie Gummer) during her divorce she sees that the family she left behind years ago to chase musical stardom has ascended to an upscale existence of custom bathrooms and fridges full of kombucha. Theyve become the people who buy hundreds of dollars worth of organic groceries at the Whole Foods stand-in at which she works while shes the cashier they barely notice. Audra McDonald and Kevin Kline. Sony Pictures Gummer and Streep. Sony Pictures ID 6536908 The gap between Ricki and her family is more than one of culture and income -- though thats part of the reason her son Joshua (Sebastian Stan) has been keeping his engagement a secret from her. But plagued with guilt and defensive because of that shes also stayed away for years. That doesnt stop her from resenting the woman Pete went on to marry (Audra McDonald unrufflable) for being there when she wasnt. There are ways in which Ricki and the Flash is just as cornball and affected as promised particularly in the scenes Ricki shares with her children but the complicated nature of Rickis pain and self-pity isnt one of them. When she has a minor meltdown on stage bitterly decrying how male rock stars like Mick Jagger get to have children with multiple mothers wander away and remain beloved while women who do the same are monsters its a resonant larger point and a unfair personal one.Mothers are absolutely expected to prioritize their children over their own desires and aspirations -- the idea of a woman leaving as Ricki does gets treated as a betrayal of gender. But no one would nominate one of the famous errant men shes talking about as dad of the year. Its not acknowledgement of this inequality that she really wants but forgiveness from a family with valid reasons to resent her. ""It was my dream"" she howls at Pete who responds ""I thought we were your dream."" Ricki and the Flash doesnt condemn its heroines decisions but does ask her to level with the consequences of them ones that shes been running from for years.If Ricki had made it big she might have felt more comfortable in her choices -- fames a heady affirmation the world bestowing its fickle approval. But Ricki and the Flash demands she make peace with them as she is as a supermarket cashier and cover band singer whos been holding her guitar player boyfriend Greg (Rick Springfield) at arms length emotionally. Ricki is a showy role and as sometimes happens with Streep the characters such a plum one that you become aware of the work the forever formidable actor is doing the delight she takes in little flourishes like the moment she shuts herself in her borrowed room and exchanges a look with the dog perched on her bed. View this image > Streep Sony Pictures ID 6536917 But thats never the case onstage when Streeps pleasure and Rickis dovetail perfectly for musical numbers that are warm and intimate and sum up the congenial messiness of the movie at its best. Demme and cinematographer Declan Quinn know when to bring the camera up close to take in their star and when to turn it back on the crowd soaking up her energy. And the songs Streep makes her way through include both some familiar tunes and some unexpected ones. She can convince you that for this woman making music onstage was important enough to make some immense sacrifices for her love genuine enough to bridge some great divides.

Photo Credit Bob Vergara advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A struggling rock musician tries to reconnect with her children. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Streep and Springfield make a surprisingly sweet pair of retirement-age rockers but the scattered story line keeps losing the beat. CAST Meryl Streep Rick Springfield Mamie Gummer LENGTH 142 In the 2009 drama ""Crazy Heart"" Jeff Bridges played Bad Blake a washed-up country star trying to reconnect with the grown son he last saw as a 4-year-old. When Blakes apologetic phone call is terminated by an abrupt click our hearts go out to him. Bridges won an Oscar for the role. Would we have been so sympathetic if Blake were a mother? Thats the double standard raised by ""Ricki and the Flash"" starring Meryl Streep as Ricki Randazzo a rocker who abandoned three children for her career. Roughly 25 years later Ricki is playing in a dive bar in Tarzana California when her ex Pete (Kevin Kline) calls with bad news. Their daughter Julie is going through a divorce and needs support. The question is will Julie (Streeps real-life daughter Mamie Gummer) allow Ricki to be her mother again? Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? She might but moviegoers might not. Ricki is initially an endearing figure the die-hard rocker whose stage-ready smile hides a wounded heart. Theres pleasure in watching Streep in high heels and black leather front a fictional band called the Flash whose members are real musicians (including Rick Springfield in a moving turn). Director Jonathan Demme who made the Talking Heads concert classic ""Stop Making Sense"" nicely captures the bands comfortable vibe as they play chestnuts like Tom Pettys ""American Girl."" The more we know of Ricki though the less we like her. Shes slightly racist (her anti-Obama jokes are jarring) openly homophobic (her gay son is played by Nick Westrate) and extremely self-pitying. In the films crucial scene -- a thesis of sorts from screenwriter Diablo Cody (""Juno"") -- Ricki notes that Mick Jagger tours the world while others raise his children but any woman who misses ""one P.T.A. meeting"" is suddenly labeled a monster. True but Ricki has clearly missed more than one meeting. Looking at the mental state of Julie a snarling train wreck overplayed by Gummer its hard not to blame Ricki. ""Ricki and the Flash"" feels like a noble experiment -- a challenge to our traditional notions of motherhood -- undermined by vaguely sketched characters and a scattershot story. The sad fact is Ricki has little to offer her now-grown children. The movie though cant bear to admit it. 231 MoviesRicki and the Flash trailer advertisement | advertise on newsday ----- FOUR MORE WHO TURNED UP THE VOLUME Meryl Streep isnt the first performer to indulge her inner rock star on film. Here are four other performers who got caught between rock and a hard place. THE ROSE (1979) -- Bette Midler starred as a self-destructive rock star in this drama that was originally intended to be a biopic of Janis Joplin. Midler earned a best actress Oscar nomination and a Grammy for the title song. MoviesBig movies out this summer ROCK STAR (2001) -- Though he started his career as a rapper Mark Wahlberg went the rock star route in this comedy about the lead singer of a heavy metal tribute band who becomes front man of the actual group. Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff THE ROCKER (2008) -- Rainn Wilson took a break from TVs ""The Office"" to headline this big-screen laugher about a failed drummer in an 80s hair band who gets a second shot at stardom playing with his nephews rock group. Loosely based on the story of Pete Best the Beatles original drummer who made a cameo in the film. GET HIM TO THE GREEK (2010) -- In this ""Hangover""-esque romp outrageous comedian Russell Brand played an outrageous rock star who makes life miserable for the square dude (Jonah Hill) who has to keep him on the wagon. Of course the movie wouldnt be funny if he fully succeeded. --Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Under black vinyl chains and a sheet of blonde hair braided at the side she burns through songs by Tom Petty U2 and Bruce Springsteen in a voice thats not world-class but powerful -- she has great chest tones. Shes what youd call an ornery old gal. She voted twice for George W. Bush hates Obama and thinks gay people choose their predilections. The regulars adore her although she doesnt make enough to quit her day job as a cashier at an obvious stand-in for Whole Foods catering to crunchy types with more money than shell ever have. Ricki Rendazzo is not pretending to be something she isnt but when she takes a call from her ex-husband in Indiana we learn she was once upper-middle-class Linda Brummell who left her daughter and two sons behind -- shattered -- to pursue her dream of singing. That daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps actual child) attempted suicide following her own husbands departure -- hence the phone call. But how helpful Ricki/Linda can be is a big question. She has kept her distance from them and any other kind of long-term commitment. Ricki and the Flash charts what happens when she flies to Indiana to face a different kind of music. If you cant believe that the exuberantly lowbrow Ricki was married to straight-laced workaholic Peter (Kevin Kline) and that her kids are ultra-liberal and ultragreen youre not going to like the movie. You seriously have to suspend disbelief. The screenwriter is Diablo Cody (of Juno and Young Adult) whose characters are often coarser than they need to be -- anything for a laugh. The difference is that shes working with director Jonathan Demme American cinemas most inclusive humanist and though her glib dialogue doesnt always mesh with Demmes looser more generous disposition the tonal seesaw keeps you off guard. Its a good tension. Rickis family -- not to put too fine a point on it -- hates her and the scenes in which she endures their anger refusing to apologize but shaken by the intensity of their feelings are so grim that you know a kiss-and-make-up ending is unlikely. Although its fun to see Streep acting opposite Gummer and Kline (who terrorized her three decades ago in Sophies Choice) there are no in-jokes. Kline plays it prim and awkward while Gummer -- with limp hair and an ashen complexion -- doesnt fall into an easy mother-daughter rhythm even when Ricki sweeps Julie off to the beauty parlor. The movie keeps its edge. Its hard in this context to admire Rickis decision to leave her family but when she returns to that Tarzana bar and acidly laments that male musicians like Mick Jagger have kids with different women and no one demonizes them you have to concede the point. Ricki and the Flash swerves near stereotypes and swerves away at every turn. Audra McDonald is Peters second wife a seeming killjoy who makes you like her for taking the long view of her familys welfare. Musician Rick Springfield is Greg Rickis sometime lover and the groups hot-dog guitarist He has a dopey sweetness that makes you want to see Greg and Ricki together. The movie jells in a final sequence the wedding of Rickis other son. Its a typically mean Diablo Cody setup the moneyed crowd looking with disgust on Ricki and Greg -- and at first it reminded me how some people felt that the abrupt cynical ending of Young Adult Codys flop with director Jason Reitman was a mark of integrity instead of too damn easy. Demme is made of different stuff. As he showed in another wedding movie Rachel Getting Married theres comfort in ritual and especially music which has the power to dissolve boundaries. No it doesnt heal primal wounds. It just gives you a glimpse of people transcending for a moment their individual grief. And it sends you home singing.

Tina Hassannia Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Aug. 06 2015 344PM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 06 2015 346PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Jonathan Demme Written by Diablo Cody Starring Meryl Streep Mamie Gummer and Kevin Kline Genre drama Year 2015 Country USA Language English A rock star (Meryl Streep) tries to make amends with the family she abandoned to pursue fame in this Diablo Cody-penned Jonathan Demme-directed dramedy. Ricki steps in to help her daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) overcome depression then finds the courage to attend her sons wedding even though no one wants her there. The ensuing litany of awkward conversations between estranged rock-mom and straitlaced family members doesnt lead to any definitive redemption for Rickis lifetime of neglect - the movie smartly avoids wishful fantasy. However charged emotional moments that suggest the changing-for-the-better familys dynamic are frequently slighted or rushed in favour of the films less messy more entertaining narrative devices such as Codys snarky humorous dialogue and Demmes fine-tuned eye for live musical performance.Regardless of its flimsy emotional interior Ricki is a worthy addition in this years growing canon of strong female-centred films and it would be wise to remember Streeps stunning performance come awards season.

Heck both films even feature musical numbers. So what went so wrong with this one?Start with the title character Ricki (Meryl Streep) a washed-up middle-aged rocker who deserted her Midwestern family years ago to pursue a music career in Los Angeles. When her daughter (Mamie Gummer) attempts suicide Ricki is pulled home to assist. Screenwriter Diablo Cody makes Ricki a pile of cliches some of them bizarrely haphazard (Rickis conservative politics are harped upon early then forgotten entirely).Early Oscar buzz circulated for Streeps transformative role in ""Ricki"" but its sure to dissipate once audiences and Oscar voters get a real look at the performance. Streeps a great actress and she sells some key emotional moments here but her performance is almost all overblown affectations. The character is cartoonish and Streep plays her accordingly.The films narrative beats are similarly slapdash. Ricki wont commit to her bandmate boyfriend (Rick Springfield) and then she does. Her family hates her and then they dont. The redemption in the films ending rings utterly hollow because we have no idea why or how anyone changed.The faults in ""Ricki"" are mostly all attributable to Cody whos written great movies like ""Juno"" but here adds one to her dud pile. Streep may have just been looking for some variety and an Oscar. But why is Demme the great director of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" wasting his time on this? Well hes spent the last few years of his career on an Ibsen adaptation and not one but two documentaries about Neil Young. Maybe like Ricki he just needed a paycheck.Patrick Dunn is an Ann Arbor-based freelance writer.Ricki and the FlashGRADE DRated PG-13 for thematic material brief drug content sexuality and languageRunning time 102 minutes 18 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1NdJi7c MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/08/07/review-ricki-flash/31267937/,200,rickiandtheflash10,rickiandtheflash,detroitnews

Itd be pretty damn cool -- if Ricki wasnt at the start of her career but already in her 60s. And if she hadnt given up everything - including marriage to a nice guy and three children - to get there. This is the set-up for ""Ricki and the Flash"" and frankly the real problem with it is Rickis age. You can understand (if not approve) of an early twenty-something parent splitting to run off and try to be a rock star. But a thirty-something parent? It almost seems like Zelda-Fitzgerald-level madness and I wonder if the script werent simply rudely adjusted once Meryl Streep 66 signed on as star. (Hey well add 10 years wholl notice?) Its not that Streep doesnt look great or cant sing - she always could as she proved again in ""Into the Woods"" and shes got a fine Bonnie-Raitt-ish rock voice - but Ricki should be 50-something not 60-something and her kids should be 20-ish not 30-ish. Given the issues at hand and the levels of (im)maturity everyone is about a decade too old. Still theres a kind of fond literally familiar feeling to ""Ricki and the Flash"" that makes it easy to take. Some of that is the story (Ricki late in life tries to affect a raprochement with her adult estranged children). Part of that is the casting (playing Streeps daughter is one of Streeps kids Mamie Gummer). And much of that is the old-friends ambience created by Streeps pal Kevin Kline (playing her ex) and director Jonathan Demme whos been concentrating on documentaries lately. Unfortunately ""Ricki and the Flash"" is a long way from Demmes ""Rachel Getting Married."" That 2008 feature had lots of improvised drama and a standout performance by Anne Hathaway as a bitter sister of the bride. This one has a sometimes contrived script by Diablo Cody and a real reluctance to get as rough as the material demands. Wheres the scene where the far-too-amiable Kline finally tells off Streep for walking out on him and their three kids? Or the ones where Streep and her children truly work through their issues? She shows up they hate her - then she plays a few songs at a family celebration and everyone loves her again. Demme is one of our most forgiving directors but this forgiveness is unearned. Its a screenwriters trick as is Rickis odd insistence on keeping Rick Springfield her patiently devoted boyfriend at arms length. Streep is truly terrific and she has one great scene where she and Klines second wife - the fabulous Audra McDonald - do really go at it. And Demme typically gives all the characters physical and emotional space both pulling the camera back and letting scenes go on. (Several times Streep and her tight band play songs in full instead of just the few verses another filmmaker would allow them.) But while there are some bright notes in Codys writing the situations feel a little tired and the characters unexplored. (Gummer for example enters enraged is treated as a spoiled child throughout - her parents even fight with her ex-husband on her behalf - and then is seen suddenly dancing triumphantly at the finale). Both Streep and Kline are incapable of giving bad performances and former heartthrob Springfield is surprisingly affecting as Streeps lover (although - I admit - I kept looking at his eyes and wondering hmm has he had work?) And the music - as youd expect from the director of ""Stop Making Sense"" - is tasty and well presented with some real pros in Rickis back-up band. But in the end ""Ricki"" is kind of rocky. And over in a flash. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations and substance abuse. Ricki and the Flash (PG-13) Sony/Tristar (102 min.) Directed by Jonathan Demme. With Meryl Streep Mamie Gummer Kevin Kline. Opens Friday in New Jersey.   1/2 Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com. Follow him on Twitter stephenwhitty. Find him on Facebook.

Comments Ricki and the Flash Rated PG-13  100 minutes  2015 Oscar-winner Jonathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs) directs Oscar-winner Meryl Streep (The Iron Lady Sophies Choice Kramer vs. Kramer) in a script by Oscar-winner Diablo Cody (Juno) and the result is cold porridge. Streep plays an aging bar-band rocker in southern California who travels to Indianapolis to reconnect with the square nuclear family she ditched decades earlier and the outsize character invites one of her most grandstanding performances. Like Codys previous bad-girl-comes-home drama Young Adult (2011) this consists mainly of family members crabbing at each other over the past and like Demmes last indie hit Rachel Getting Married (2008) it ends with a semicomic wedding ceremony. Youd think that Demme so lauded for his concert documentaries could have wrung a little more juice out of the bar-band scenes but Streep is clearly faking it which leaves Rick Springfield to deliver the goods as her guitarist boyfriend.

"Ricki and the Flash -- if the flick is rockin then keep on watchin review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRicki and the Flash -- if the flick is rockin then keep on watchin reviewJonathan Demme seems beset by conflicting intentions with his Meryl Streep vehicle Ricki and the Flash. Would he rather be filming another Stop Making Sense concert movie or another Rachel Getting Married melodrama?By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 6 2015Ricki and the FlashStarring Meryl Streep Rick Springfield Kevin Kline and Mamie Gummer. Directed by Jonathan Demme. At GTA theatres. 100 minutes. PGJonathan Demme is so good at reinventing the concert movie working with the likes of Neil Young and Talking Heads it would be fun to see him make a real show out of Ricki and the Flash.With Meryl Streep enthusiastically grabbing the mic and jangling the guitar as the title Ricki and real rocker Rick Springfield and several studio aces backing her as the Flash (including the recently departed Rick Rosas Youngs bass player) this could have been more than the fitful melodrama it becomes.Article Continued BelowDemme seems beset by conflicting intentions especially since Streep is no pretender -- shes proven her musical chops in many movies. Would he rather be filming another Stop Making Sense or another Rachel Getting Married? He lets the camera linger on moments like the opening cover of Tom Pettys ""American Girl"" wherein Streep and Springfield establish their great chemistry together even though their characters Ricki and Greg cant quite find the beat as offstage lovers. She calls it ""banter"" he calls it romance.Then things get soapy as Demme and screenwriter Diablo Cody shift into an entire seasons worth of daytime drama cliches. Ricki known as Linda in her previous life has more psychic baggage than she does braids bangles and tattoos having long ago forsaken the mommy track for the rock n roll highway. She left behind in Indianapolis a disgruntled ex-husband (Kevin Kline) two estranged sons (Sebastian Stan and Nick Westrate) and a furious daughter (Mamie Gummer Streeps real daughter).And what does Ricki have to show for it? An album that sold in double digits a part-time job checking groceries at a health food store and regular gigs at a Tarzana Calif. bar where the glazed regulars demand covers of songs by Lady Gaga and Pink as well as Petty and Bruce Springsteen. A failed suicide attempt by her daughter Julie prompts an emergency family reunification in Indianapolis wherein ex-hubby Pete and his equally Squaresville wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) will gang up to judge Ricki unless she can somehow change the tune.The script by Diablo Cody doesnt make the best use of the Juno scribes trademark snark. For every zinger that hits -- Ricki acidly observes that Mick Jagger fathered seven children from four women and nobody questions his parenting skills -- there are several that clang like a mangled chord. Julies fury isnt given much context. There are no flashbacks of say the time mom skipped out on her daughters piano recital so she could open for Melissa Etheridge. Kline fares better as the torch-carrying Pete who cant even get the family poodle to respect him. First teamed with Streep in Sophies Choice so long ago he wins empathy as a guy wondering why hes wandering around in a cardigan while his ex-wife is out looking for adventure and whatever else comes her way.The most felicitous pairing though is between Streep and Springfield especially when theyre on stage making music. Its where they and Demme really want to be and their abundant harmony makes Ricki and the Flash worth watching and rocking to.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Yet theres little she can do in the face of pedestrian direction (by Jonathan Demme) and a sketchy disjointed script (by Diablo Cody.)

"Review Ricki and the Flashs Meryl Streep rocks out but storys out of tune - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Meryl Streep rocks in Ricki and the Flash but story is out of tune Ricki and the Flash Bob Vergara / TriStar Pictures Meryl Streep in ""Ricki and the Flash."" Meryl Streep in ""Ricki and the Flash."" (Bob Vergara / TriStar Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter ""Ricki and the Flash"" is a sour movie masquerading as something more cheerful. In that attempted deception the film is both helped and hindered by an indispensable performance by star Meryl Streep.Streep plays a woman with two names and in effect two identities. Shes introduced as Ricki Rendazzo the leather-wearing lead singer and guitarist of Ricki and the Flash an energetic cover band that has called a bar in Tarzana home since 2008. After ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Into the Woods"" its not news that Streep is an excellent singer and having learned to play the guitar for this film she really tears into standards like ""American Girl"" ""Wooly Bully"" and ""Keep Playing That Rock n Roll.""As directed by Jonathan Demme whose own musical credentials are impeccable (the Talking Heads documentary ""Stop Making Sense"" among others) and vividly shot by Declan Quinn these live performances are the only unalloyed pleasure ""Ricki and the Flash"" provides. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;Ricki off stage turns out to be a trouble-making pain in the neck who gets aggrieved the way only the truly self-involved can manage. Since she is the actress she is Streep is totally convincing at this bad behavior which creates problems because Diablo Codys dispiriting screenplay is all about everyone coming to love Ricki faults and all and that is just not convincingly done. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story ""Ricki and the Flash"" opens with the band performing at the fictitious Salt Well in Tarzana. Never mind that her audience is old enough to have danced for Dick Clark on ""American Bandstand"" or that her tight band with hunky Greg (an excellent Rick Springfield) on lead guitar looks like it should be playing at AARP benefits. Its rock n roll and she likes it. A lot.As it turns out however to follow that career path Ricki has had to completely abandon her family. Back home in Indianapolis where shes known as Linda Brummell there is an ex-husband (since remarried) and three now-adult children she has had no contact with in years. Though to all intents and purposes a stranger Ricki has been a toxic influence on the family she heedlessly abandoned. Movie and TV ReviewsRead more stories Then as it often does in the movies comes a phone call out of nowhere from stuffy ex-husband Pete (an underused Kevin Kline). It seems that their daughter Julie has been left by her husband and is next door to distraught.In the real world Ricki who couldnt even be bothered to attend Julies wedding would be the last person to get such a call. But in the first of numerous improbable events Ricki is soon heading back to the Midwest to hang with Julie and her dad in the gated community mansion belonging to Pete and his conveniently absent wife.At first no one is especially happy to see Ricki especially not Julie who all but bites her head off with lines like ""do you have a gig tonight or do you always dress like a hooker from Night Court?""Playing Julie is Streeps real-life daughter and rising young actress Mamie Gummer a choice that does not work out well. Julies initial anger is so unmodulated it loses effectiveness the changes of mood mandated by the script are so unconvincing (""Sometimes a girl just needs her mother"" Ricki says feebly) that the whole thing starts to feel like an acting exercise rather than a performance.While Rickis two adult sons conveniently also still in Indianapolis are also not delighted to have Ricki back everyones displeasure dissipates to a surprising extent almost immediately. Then the film goes about its business of giving Ricki a second chance and attempting to bludgeon us into admiring her as a true artist who had no choice but to follow her star.Given that almost everyone in the film including Petes new wife and domestic paragon Maureen (Audra McDonald) is unpleasant to one degree or another ""Ricki and the Flash"" tends to increasingly fall back on Streeps singing prowess. ""Originally Jonathan said three songs"" Streep says in the press notes. ""Well there are ten songs in the movie -- ten"" Its not hard to see why.Twitter KennethTuran------------Ricki and the FlashMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic material brief drug content sexuality and languageRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying In general release------------MOREScreenwriter Diablo Cody follows her muse to Ricki and the FlashSuper powers not enough to save Fantastic Four Shaun the Sheep absurdly amusing for all ages Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Meryl Streep Diablo Cody Kevin Kline Dick Clark Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ricki-flash-review-20150807-column.html,200,rickiandtheflash17,rickiandtheflash,latimes

A middle-aged rocker helps her daughter cope. Director Jonathan Demme (142). PG-13 Language. Area theaters. ""Streep Purple."" ""Meryl Streepsteen."" ""Streep Trick."" Call it what you will but Meryl Streeps mom-age rocker-chick portrayal partly saves ""Ricki and the Flash."" The summertime film season makes Streep fun anyway -- ""Mamma Mia"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" being prime examples. When shes onstage and letting loose Jonathan Demmes movie finds its groove. When shes offstage though its mostly a middle-of-the-road middlebrow gig. Ricki Rendazzo (Streep) is a grocery-store clerk who plays cover tunes at a California bar with her band the Flash. She and her guitarist Greg (Rick Springfield happy just to be here) have a good thing going. Then Ricki gets a call from her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) informing her that their grown daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps real-life daughter) in the midst of a divorce has attempted suicide. Meryl Streep and Mami Gummer as mother and daughter in ""Ricki and the Flash"" (Sony Pictures) Ricki reluctantly heads back to the family she left behind in Indiana. That includes Pete Julie and sons Josh (Sebastian Stan) and Adam (Nick Westrate). While helping to get Julie back on her feet Ricki learns that Josh is getting married and that Adam who she always thought was bisexual is gay. As she gets used to these faces from her past Ricki also has to reforge a detente with Petes sweet but strong second wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) who raised the kids. Theres a lot here that doesnt work -- and it all comes back to Diablo Codys cliche-ridden screenplay. (Among other things Ricki who left these dullards and is never without a punky hairdo has an issue with a son being gay?) Skittering on the edges though there are things that suggest a movie with a more complex inner life. Streep and Rick Springfield play members of a bar band. (Bob Vergara) That depth comes primarily from Streep who locates a scratchy bitchy core to Ricki. Shes unlikable and Streep knows it which keeps us watching. Theres a lived-in acceptance of choices. This comes across in her scenes at a cash register and when she gets to live out her passion at the microphone. Her moments with the pleasantly mellow Kline (a ""Sophies Choice"" reunion) have a quirky but genial discomfort too. Gummer is blooming into something special as well. The mother-daughter scenes click; while Julies bathrobe-wearing mental breakdown is too much Gummers vulnerability stings. But other moments feel as if Demmes affinity for shagginess and musicality -- utilized better in ""Rachel Getting Married"" and all his 80s films -- is filling in the gaps. The story here like a lot of bar bands goes loud to cover up mediocrity. When Streep sings though so does the film.

Bob Vergara/Corutesy of TriStar Pictures hide caption toggle caption Bob Vergara/Corutesy of TriStar Pictures Ricky (Meryl Streep) performs at the Salt Well in a scene from Ricki and the Flash. Bob Vergara/Corutesy of TriStar Pictures For the dozen or two regulars at The Salt Well in the San Fernando Valley watching the house band is like stepping into a musical time machine where everyone has aged but the song remains the same. By any standard Ricki and the Flash rates as a better-than-average bar band fronted by Ricki Rendazzo--a stage name that now almost poignantly reflects a long-forgotten dream of rock superstardom. They perform serviceable covers of Tom Petty and U2 and with some reluctance bust out the occasional song from the last few years to get the handful of under-40 people in the crowd on the dance floor. The lead guitarist has a thing for Ricki but it mostly manifests itself as banter on stage and a casual romp on lonely nights so long as it doesnt get serious. Playing at The Salt Well isnt a springboard to anything but the last stop on the tour a pleasant venue for a band slipping into obsolescence. Written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jonathan Demme Ricki and the Flash could be called Ragged Glory if Neil Young Demmes friend and frequent collaborator hadnt already taken the title for himself. In front of fossilized barflies Ricki can get away with her black-leather wardrobe her side braids and raccoon eyeliner and her assortment of regrettable tattoos and tacky costume jewelry. But in the harsh light of day shes just an odd-looking supermarket cashier named Linda Brummell collecting 450 a week while a supervisor half her age asks her to smile more. As played by Meryl Streep who can now add ""play guitar"" to the long list of things she can do as an actress Ricki lives every day with the consequences of a choice she made long ago. She wanted to be a Chrissie Hynde. It didnt work out for her. The film Ricki and the Flash looks like poor Linda Brummell inside a multiplex still humming with superhero movies remakes and remakes of superhero movies but it also possesses her abundance of personality and soul. Against the machine-tooled blockbusters of summer Demmes film stands out for its modesty of scale and its abiding interest in the untidy business of being human. To put it in rock terms Demme and Cody dont care about putting on the perfect show; they care about putting on a great show which can accommodate some looseness in the set. Shortly after establishing the sad parameters of Rickis life which currently teeters on financial bankruptcy the film whisks her away to Indianapolis where her grown daughter Julie (played by Streeps own talented child Mamie Gummer) is reeling from a sudden divorce. Since leaving her own husband Pete (Kevin Kline) to pursue her musical ambitions Ricki has been a woefully inconsistent presence in the lives of Julie and her two sons Adam (Nick Westrate) and Josh (Sebastian Stan) who have long since taken to calling Petes current wife (Audra McDonald) their mother. She looks out of place among the snobs in Petes gated community and she scarcely does better with Julie and her other children who use the opportunity to hammer her for past and present wrongs. Meanwhile back in California her guitarist Greg (Rick Springfield) seeks the type of deep commitment that shes been historically reluctant to give. Ricki and the Flash doesnt behave like an ordinary musical drama in that its willing to abandon the music for the entire second act (and then some) to allow Ricki to work out the tension with her family. Their grievances with her are absolutely legitimate as are the reasons shes become estranged from them poverty geographical distance another woman assuming her role. Typical of many Demme films there are no villains here just the natural conflict between fundamentally decent people whose choices have put them at odds with one another. Codys script has the funny feminist kick expected of the writer behind Juno and Young Adult but like Charlize Theron in Young Adult Rickis attempt to cling to her rebellious past carries a devastating cost. Shes both resilient for keeping the dream alive and a sad relic of another era and Cody and Demme present her as the hot mess she is. Streep plays Ricki as lovably oblivious but also wry and caring when the occasion calls for it and earnest in her desire for some sliver of redemption. Ricki and the Flash favors conventional dramatic payoffs but at least theyre hard-won with Ricki fighting her way through class differences ugly family history and humiliation to find her place. Demmes humanity and optimism has been a hallmark of his work from Melvin and Howard to Rachel Getting Married. A warmth radiates through Ricki and the Flash like a song sung true. A film that adores its characters this much is sure to be adored in kind.

Thats drummer Joe Vitale keyboardist Bernie Worrell and bassist Rick Rosas with Rick Springfield on guitar to play lover-boy Greg. Ricki is no star and director Jonathan Demme with music in his DNA offers a heartfelt salute to those who play the underside of rock amp; roll because well they have to. Too bad the rest of the movie with a script by Diablo Cody is dime-a-dozen family soap opera. It helps that Kevin Kline excels as Rickis ex and Mamie Gummer Streeps real-life daughter imbues the fictional version with rare grit and grace. Otherwise too many wrong notes.

Sam the Sham would approve. Ricki and the Flash stars Streep as aging rocker Ricki Rendazzo a woman who marches to her own drummer but at a cost. Ricki lives on the West Coast and plays with a creaky old bar band by night; by day shes a cashier at an upscale grocery store. Somewhere in the Midwest is the family she left behind to pursue her passion for music -- but her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) is remarried now and the kids are all grown up so thats all water under the bridge. Then her daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps real life daughter) has a marital crisis. Ricki reluctantly goes home to Indianapolis to try to help. Nobody is very happy to see Ricki daughter Julie is a mess unwashed and permanently in pyjamas; one of Rickis sons accuses her of not even knowing that hes gay and her other son hopes Ricki wont find out about his wedding -- he doesnt want her to be there. There are plenty of fish-out-of-water laughs to be had at Rickis expense as she stumbles around suburbia and tries to resuscitate her relationship with her family. Shes plenty rough around the edges and this is haute boogie Indiana so the contrast is funny. Ricki is not an entirely likeable character either so there are interesting moments of discomfort involved in watching the story unfold. For all that it moves toward a feel-good family ties finale Ricki and the Flash has a lot to say about contemporary society. Just under the laughs are some hard truths about equality and economics not to mention expectations of modern motherhood. The main problem with the movie is that the comedy and these dramatic underpinnings never quite fit together. You can see what screenwriter Diablo Cody (who won an Oscar for writing Juno) is after via the character of Ricki a woman who stands by her choices even when theyre unpopular but the comedy elements keep overpowering all that. Luckily there are other things to hold your attention first among those things being Streeps performance as an aging rocker. The actress learned to play guitar for this role and she is -- as always -- entirely believable. Director Jonathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs) knows his way around the music world -- think of all those Neil Young documentaries -- and there are several extended music scenes in the movie. Whenever Streep and the band (which includes Rick Springfield Bernie Worrell and the late Rick Rosas) are playing Ricki and the Flash is terrific. And when they arent playing ... its still okay. Nobody is going to mistake Ricki and the Flash for a great movie but the experience of watching it is pretty trippy and often hugely entertaining. Streeps cover of Bruce Springsteens My Love Will Not Let You Down for example is an electrifying bit to witness. And then theres that snippet of Wooly Bully ...

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Creating a film with solid drama beside good humor is tough. Its harder still to balance them against a complicated character so they dont sprawl lopsided and to send the audience home feeling satisfied. The bittersweet beautifully acted ""Ricki and the Flash"" does all that with surprising grace and economy. At the center of the movie is Ricki a veteran rocker played in a juicy fearless performance by Meryl Streep. Her Ricki has a lowbrow right-wing hippie-stoner vibe -- like a female Ted Nugent. Even advancing into AARP territory a musician like this draws many moths to the flame and theres sexual desire in her life but her main passion is for music. When she plays and sings she connects to the world much better than through her frankly clumsy stage patter. Ricki long ago left the Midwest for California and stardom. Shes still pursuing a slim version of that old dream. Playing for her small fan base with her loyal bar band doesnt pay the rent in her dumpy apartment -- her cashier work at a posh food co-op does nearly -- but she adores it like nothing else in life. That includes the family she resigned decades ago. After bearing three children she left the domestic orbit stepped up to every available stage out West and never turned back. The big-hearted script is by Diablo Cody whose ""Juno"" and ""Young Adult"" were darkly humorous takes on the need for imperfect women to evolve. She lays her characters foibles bare with heart and hope. Here she suggests that avoiding maternal responsibilities didnt make Ricki a bad person but a flawed one deserting a duty she didnt feel was in her range. In wonderful deadpan Kevin Kline plays Rickis ex-husband Pete a pleasant square who remarried and became a vastly successful Indiana business owner. When they met they were clearly opposites attracting. He is as calm and drab as Ricki is rough-edged a logician capable of every task except piloting relationships. With one of their grown sons about to marry soon beleaguered Pete calls in Rickis help to calm their daughter Julie. She is hysterical over her own impending divorce and Pete needs her to participate in the big fussy wedding ceremony without shrieking. The film takes a while to get going like a slow cooker. It warms up when Ricki enters Petes high-gloss mansion to confront her history becoming increasingly entangled in her old familys lives. The mom-daughter dynamic is pure nitroglycerin at first. Streeps real-life daughter Mamie Gummer is ideally cast as Rickis frenzied girl. She resembles her eternally impressive and engaging mother in action quirky looks and occasionally scalding temper. Ricki helps Julie stifle her rage over her new adult life gone awry. Apparently communicating with a grown child is easier for Ricki than rearing kids. Ricki and the FLash 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic material brief drug content sexuality and language. As Ricki becomes a nurturing force things become quasi-civilized. If Julie can stand Ricki well Pete can feel OK around her too. His wife is away on business and Rickis romantic crooning brings such a joyful sound to the big quiet house. Oh and by the way there is medical-grade cannabis in the refrigerator. What happens and doesnt happen is not to be reported but to be savored as it occurs on-screen. Be aware though that the wedding feels like the most awkward ceremony youve ever attended. Cody who won an Oscar for her very first screenplay knows how to make those moments feel sweet rather than sardonic. So do Streep and director Jonathan Demme (of the perverse classic ""Silence of the Lambs"" and the genius concert film ""Stop Making Sense"") who have won their own statues. They are all in deft control of the tone keeping the film realistic surprising and tender all at once. Cody writes some of the best dialogue around but many of the storys key points come from Streep singing classic rock covers that operate as the opening and closing scenes bookends and high points in between. Demme a filmmaker of great empathy to American pop cast musicians rather than actors as Rickis bandmates. That creates a touching supporting role for the extremely capable Rick Springfield as the Flashs backup guitarist who hopes for a bigger backup role in Rickis life. Hes one more character in the ensemble trying to pick up jagged pieces of his dreams and fit them together again both in life and love. ""Ricki and the Flash"" is rueful and deeply entertaining hilarious and deeply sad often at the same time. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Complete immersion is what she does and its what she does here.But thats really about all the film written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jonathan Demme has to offer.Oh theres the novelty of Streep acting with her real-life daughter Mamie Gummer. And Kevin Kline pads around as Streeps ex-husband his character afraid to make much of an impression on anyone (and thus neither does he) though when he shares a few scenes with Streep you get a taste of what might have been.Ah what might have been. Thats the sentiment that lingers over the whole movie. What might have been must be better than whats here because whats here isnt much.Meryl Sreep and her daughter. (Photo Sony Pictures Releasing)Ricki (Streep) used to be Linda Rendazzo but she left that name behind along with Indianapolis and her family years ago to try to make it as rocker in LA. Instead she has spent years toiling in a cover band (though the best one around thanks to the musicians mentioned before) and working at a Whole Foods knockoff.Shes also a conservative taking a few shots at President Obama from the stage although thats played as less of a plot point than a kind of personality tic.One night Ricki gets a call from Pete (Kline) her former husband and hes desperate Their daughter Julie (Gummer) is suicidally depressed after her husband left her. Petes current wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) is out of town visiting her sick father. Could Linda -- er Ricki -- come and help?Shes broke (and filing for bankruptcy) but Ricki winds up back in Indiana at Petes palatial home where Julie is a mess. Julie hasnt eaten or showered in days (the epic knot in her hair is by itself worthy of an Oscar nomination) and she doesnt exactly roll out the welcome mat for her mother. But over time her defenses break down; Ricki is good for her and shes good for Ricki and if this surprises you maybe this is your first movie.Rickis sons are a little harder to break down. Adam (Nick Westrate) is a seething ball of resentment over Rickis abandoning the family. Hes also gay which he seems to think will offend Rickis conservative sensibilities but again not so much. Joshua (Sebastian Stan) is a little more forgiving though not so much that he wants to invite his mother to his upcoming wedding.AZCENTRALRicki and the Flash (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThere are fights and embarrassing restaurant dinners and late-night bull sessions and singing and in one weird bit the discovery of marijuana in Petes freezer which seems to portend something entertaining but never does. Like so much else in this movie its a promise thats never delivered upon.As with Demmes ""Rachel Getting Married"" a wedding plays a central part in the film. And as in that movie an excruciating toast signifies a lot -- embarrassment a lack of tact genuine love. But in ""Ricki and the Flash"" once that toast is delivered the movie just sort of stops. Oh things continue to happen for a little while. They just dont seem to happen for much of a reason.This is a talented cast working for a talented director in a film that never reaches the heights it should have.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Not Every Summer Movie Needs Expensive Special Effects. Some Have Meryl Streep. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 6 2015 1036 AM I Wanna Get Lost in Your Rock n Roll Meryl Streep is wondrous as a washed-up rocker in Ricki and the Flash. By Dana Stevens Meryl Streep in Ricki and the Flash. Courtesy of Sony Pictures The words summer movie suggest an outsize spectacle involving CGI megalizards sexy ninja warriors and wanton destruction visited on the skylines of the worlds great cities. But there are other types of movie releases associated with the season one of my perennial favorites being the Meryl Streep Summer Movie. (The enduringly charismatic Streep is come to think of it kind of a sexy ninja warrior herself.) The Devil Wears Prada was released in midsummer as were Julie amp; Julia Mamma Mia and Hope Springs. Streep summer movies tend to be light often sentimental comedies that explore intergenerational conflict or family dysfunction while still sending viewers out of the theater on a note of warm uplift. Theyre movies you might plausibly take your grandmother to (though the geriatric sex-therapy scenes in Hope Springs could get awkward) and then talk about afterward over crepes at the mall. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I have nothing against a good plate of mall crepes and I wish my grandmothers were still around to see Ricki and the Flash. Jonathan Demmes uneven but ebullient film stars Streep as a sixtysomething rock musician named Ricki Rendazzo. (At least thats the name she insists on going by though her drivers license IDs her more prosaically as Linda Brummel.) Ricki might be described as a washed-up rock star had she ever had a real career to shipwreck and then wash up from. Her bar band the Flash has a longstanding weekly gig playing covers--Tom Petty Bruce Springsteen the occasional Lady Gaga or Pink tune--and they seem to have built a small but loyal following among the resolutely unhip patrons of the Salt Well in Tarzana California. But Rickis only real source of income is her job as a cashier at Total Foods--a transparent Whole Foods stand-in complete with stifling bourgie alienation. Though shes dating her guitarist Greg--a nicely cast Rick Springfield whose scruffy off-kilter sex appeal recalls a Robert Altman hero from the 70s--Ricki resists commitment going so far as to belittle their relationship onstage in an ill-chosen bit of would-be banter. Advertisement As soon becomes clear a lot of Rickis choices are ill ones. Shes just filed for bankruptcy and is more or less estranged from her family having left her husband and three children decades before to pursue her music career. Her ex Pete (Kevin Kline) has since remarried and become a successful businessman the kind with rigid habits and tasteful monogrammed cardigans. When Pete calls to tell her that their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps daughter in real life) has spun into depression after a failed marriage Ricki somehow scrapes together the money to fly to Indianapolis where the rest of her family still lives. Too broke to afford a hotel Ricki inveigles her way into a guest room at the swanky McMansion Pete shares with his second wife whos away at the moment caring for her own ailing father. In another bedroom nearby the volatile Julie who hasnt showered changed her clothes or combed her hair since arriving at her fathers house five days ago lies in a state of vegetative torpor. The arrival of Julies less-than-beloved mother rouses her just enough to descend on her parents for a brief screaming match. Gummer a dead ringer for her mother with a generally closer-to-the-vest performing style makes a grand entrance into the movie on the shrieked line ""Julie isnt looking forward to shit"" The first third of the movie is a fish-out-of-water comedy in which the raccoon-mascaraed toe-ringed compulsively irreverent Ricki tries to fit back in with a family whose languages and rhythms she no longer understands. One son (Sebastian Stan) is engaged to a pretty conventional woman who seems quietly horrified to meet her fiances foul-mouthed progenitor. The other (Nick Westrate) whos gay is resentful of his mothers long absence and what he sees as her latent homophobia. Ricki is one of those people whose mere presence goads people into doing things they know they shouldnt. She urges the suicidal Julie to skip psychotherapy with the paradoxical exhortation to ""call in sick"" She locates a stash of marijuana in Petes freezer and somehow convinces him to smoke some with her and their daughter loosening him up so much he half-admits to still being in love with her. When Petes imperturbable wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) gets back home the next day she politely but firmly insists that its time for Ricki to go. But when another family event calls Ricki back to Indianapolis she must decide whats truly worth keeping both from her old life and from the new one shes built for herself. Advertisement The screenplay (by Juno/Young Adult scribe Diablo Cody) doesnt lack for memorable zingers and thanks to Codys script and Streeps performance Ricki emerges as a complex self-contradictory person (even if most of the supporting characters dont). A woman from a blue-collar background she lost a brother in the Vietnam War and has been a fierce support-our-troops patriot ever since Theres an enormous American flag tattooed across her back and as one of her painfully progressive children observes with distaste she voted for George W. Bush twice. Rickis conservative political beliefs--and the homophobia and racism we occasionally hear her give almost unconscious voice to--make for this movies most disappointing unexplored avenue. Petes second wife is black--a fact that especially after we hear Ricki crack a bad Obama joke in the direction of her black keyboard player seems likely to come into play in the story somehow until it doesnt. I was nervously anticipating a moment in which some subplot about Rickis unacknowledged biases would be too clumsily handled; instead the issue was dropped entirely which felt even worse. A movie that could have been about more than the battles within one isolated middle-class family steered its course firmly in the direction of domestic dramedy and never looked back. Ricki and the Flash may not be top-drawer Jonathan Demme but it also doesnt come from the lowest drawer in the directors bureau the one containing nothing but a few old pennies and The Truth About Charlie. Its a mixture of two things Demme at his best can excel at the misfit comedy and the concert film. Its no Melvin and Howard or Something Wild but like those movies it features a flawed yet lovable protagonist who learns to adapt to radically changing circumstances. And its no Stop Making Sense or Neil Young Heart of Gold but like those movies it demonstrates a keen ear for music and a patient camera that allows singers whole uninterrupted live performances in which to shine. Several important story developments are communicated entirely through song As Ricki and her band dig into a cover of the Dobie Gray hit ""Drift Away"" her changing mood tells us everything we need to know about whats going on behind those raccoon-ringed eyes. Streep learned how to play guitar for the role (presumably while listening to language tapes to teach herself Basque for her next one) and while her pipes may not be as virtuosic as those of her co-star Broadway diva McDonald (who never gets to sing here) Streep can communicate the emotional tenor of a song and the joy of playing music itself like nobodys business. Ricki has at least one tune in her repertoire ""Cold One"" that isnt a cover--its written in the movie by her. (In real life its by Jenny Lewis and Johnathan Rice.) The scene in which Ricki picks up an acoustic guitar to sing it to her ex-husband and grown daughter constitutes the films emotional high point the closest Ricki ever comes to acknowledging what her single-minded pursuit of her passion has cost her family and herself. Its one of my favorite moments in a movie this summer even if the only special effect is Demmes camera tracking steadily in to focus on his heroines haunting and haunted eyes.

Ricki (Meryl Streep) was a wife and mother when she said goodbye to all that and pursued a career as a rock star. She imagined herself as the kind of performer whod grace the cover of Rolling Stone.Now many years later shes lead singer for a cover band called the Flash. Whether its name is a subtle reference to her unsuccessful stab at stardom -- as in ""flash in the pan"" -- is unclear. But playing in a dingy local bar is a far cry from packing them in at Madison Square Garden.No one has to tell Ricki that things havent turned out as she planned. But she seems happy enough -- until her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) who still has a copy of her one and only record album gets in touch with troubling news. Their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) is in a deep depression and might appreciate a visit from her estranged mom. Reluctantly Ricki agrees to spend time with the family she left behind. But that also means dealing with Petes wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) whos not shy about reminding her of her motherly failings.""Ricki and the Flash"" the latest film from director Jonathan Demme (""Rachel Getting Married"") is just quirky enough to redeem its fairly routine tale of regret and redemption. Working from a screenplay by Diablo Cody (""Juno"") Demme keeps the laughs coming without undercutting the anger and bitterness in Rickis family dynamic. As the remorseful yet resourceful central character Streep delivers one of her most appealing performances. Kline who co-starred with Streep in ""Sophies Choice"" back in the 1980s is engagingly unflappable. Streeps real-life daughter Gummer is delightfully droll. And rocker Rick Springfield of ""Jessies Girl"" fame acquits himself well as Rickis bandmate and boyfriend.Quite a few filmgoers lament the shortage of movies for adults. ""Ricki and the Flash"" goes against that trend with rock n roll attitude.What ""Ricki and the Flash""  Three stars out of four  Run time 140  Rating PG-13  Content Thematic material drug content sexuality language  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Ricki And The Flash Calvin Wilson Meryl Streep Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Now that her daughter needs her Ricki is forced to address the pain she has caused her children for so many years. (  / Sony Pictures) Ricki and the Flash"" so carefully cultivates its air of gritty authenticity that it comes as a shock when it rings so gratingly false. The inviting yet ultimately too-tame dramedy about a hard-bitten wannabe rock star has much to recommend it -- chiefly an earthy pleasingly musical turn by Meryl Streep in the title role. As Ricki Rendazzo the actress channels Bonnie Raitt with just a smidge of Lucinda Williams singing and playing guitar while fronting a scruffy Boomer-era cover band in a no-name bar in the San Fernando Valley. From the moment ""Ricki and the Flash"" opens -- with Streep belting out an energetic full-throated version of Tom Pettys ""American Girl"" -- at least two of the big questions about the film are definitively answered Yes Streep can sing. (Didnt we put that to rest with ""A Prairie Home Companion""?) And yes she proves startlingly convincing as a smoky voiced good-timin gal whos as road-weary as she is game for one more gig. [The 2015 Summer Movie Guide] Streep learned to play guitar for ""Ricki and the Flash"" and it shows holding her own against a backup band that includes real-life musicians Bernie Worrell Joe Vitale Rick Springfield and the late legendary bassist Rick Rosas. The films efforts to keep it real extend all the way to the Midwest where Ricki is called to tend to Julie the most troubled and estranged of her three kids. And who better to fill that juicy role than Streeps real-life daughter Mamie Gummer? Ricki (Meryl Streep) is still chasing her rock star dream which means performing in small clubs with her band the Flash. (Bob Vergara/Sony Pcitures Entertainment) Rickis daugher Julie left is played by Streeps real-life daughter Mamie Gummer. Rickis boyfriend her guitarist Greg played by rocker/actor Rick Springfield. (Bob Vergara/Sony Pcitures Entertainment) As Julie Gummer comes in hot and only gradually lets up not so much entering the scene as descending like a haggard spiky ball of rage and hurt. The character is a rat-haired mess whos been dumped by her husband and who will never forgive her mother for abandoning the family to follow her cockeyed dreams of stardom. Rickis ex-husband -- who still knows her as ""Linda"" -- is played by Kevin Kline who has his own off-screen history with Streep going back to ""Sophies Choice."" Klines facial expressions alone span pained embarrassment supreme discomfort and furtive sad-eyed longing suggesting a wealth of unresolved issues that could have propelled the story forward. Sadly those enticing complications elude screenwriter Diablo Cody who is content for ""Ricki and the Flash"" to play even the most awkward angry outbursts for maximum glibness and minimum probing. Rickis trajectory as a feckless commitment-phobe obeys roughly the same saved-by-a-nice-guy guidelines as ""Trainwreck."" But what might have been a funny and observant glimpse of identity self-deceit and the meaning of family instead plays like a sanitized version of a messier more interesting tale. Like Julies lightning-fast spa-day makeover and conveniently timed emotional switch-ups the entire movie feels eager to please and too pat as if the filmmakers dont trust the audience with thornier nuances. The need to spoon-feed might explain why redundant on-screen titles keep popping up to explain perfectly obvious locations. When Ricki yells ""Good evening Tarzana"" for instance we pretty much get that were in Tarzana. These missteps are all the more surprising given that director Jonathan Demme knows his way around not just music (""Stop Making Sense"") but family dysfunction (""Rachel Getting Married""). Theres no doubt that ""Ricki and the Flash"" benefits from his judgment and taste from the casting of Springfield -- who delivers an understated utterly sincere performance as Rickis lead guitarist and love interest -- to the filmmakers ease in staging the bands live performances in front of their rapidly graying fans. Those shows primarily comprise heavy-rotation rock classics with one or two songs by Lady Gaga or Pink thrown in for the kids. Theres only one original song in ""Ricki and the Flash"" -- a lovely ballad written by Jenny Lewis and Johnathan Rice -- which gives the musical numbers a lame karaoke feel a cheesiness that isnt helped by flash-mobby choreography or Rickis anti-Obama aside to Worrell the only African American in the group. ""Ricki and the Flash"" is spiked with moments of genuine connection usually between Streep Gummer and Kline but also when Audra McDonald shows up as Julies quietly devoted stepmother. And its undeniably entertaining to watch Streep strum and strut her way through ""Wooly Bully"" and ""Drift Away"" with Springfield soulfully backing her up. Although sweet and likable ""Ricki and the Flash"" pulls too many punches to qualify as cathartic or even memorable. Instead its a crowd-pleaser every bit as calculated and earnestly defanged as a Golden Oldies bus-and-truck tour. Its fun while it lasts even if the Bic lighters stay safely pocketed at the end of the show. PG-13. At area theaters.

So lets just say this in the gentlest way possible The acting icon probably wont get an Oscar for portraying a down-on-her-luck aging rocker in this well-worn sapfest. PHOTOS Meryl at the Oscars The name is Ricki Randazzo. We first see her belting out the Tom Petty classic ""American Girl"" with her band The Flash in a dive bar in L.A.s Tarzana neighborhood. She has a charged flirtatious banter with her guitarist (played by Rick Springfield) and then launches into a wonky Lady Gaga cover. The word that comes to mind is ""yikes."" Its not immediately clear if shes either a has-been or a never-was-to-begin-with. But judging by the caked-on eye makeup and those long braids and that husky twang this woman has lived hard. Left in the rearview mirror? An ex-husband and three estranged kids. The family comes closer than shed like them to appear after she gets a phone call from her concerned former spouse (Kevin Kline). Her daughter Julies husband has left her for another woman and shes deeply depressed. (Julie is played by Mamie Gummer Streeps real-life offspring and a talented actress in her own right.) Klines character thinks it would be a good idea for Ricki to come back to Indiana take a sad song and make it better. Alas once she arrives home Rickis grit disappears in well a flash. And with it a potentially edgy and enlightening movie becomes a maudlin melodrama. PHOTOS Famous moms and daughters First comes the yelling. Theres lots of it as its apparently been decades since Ricki returned to the Heartland. During an awkward family dinner embittered Julie stirs the family pot of secrets; one son yells at Mom for not accepting his homosexuality; the other son smugly informs her that shes not invited to his upcoming wedding. And they all call her by her given name Linda. Ouch. Greg (Rick Springfield) Ricki (Meryl Streep) and Julie (Mamie Gummer) in Ricki and The Flash. TriStar Pictures To be fair she does act like a Linda. This supposed badass fixes Julies problems by taking her to a spa and getting her hair cut. Ta-da Self-esteem all better now. They go out for ice cream too. She also shamelessly banters with her ex though hes so straight-laced that its a wonder how they ever got to a first date. Streep and Kline who costarred in the 1982 classic drama Sophies Choice might as well be acting in two completely different movies. Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody (Juno) squanders the chance to offer authentic insight into a female musician of a certain age. How many true female rock stars have been out there touring for decades as they try to juggle a home life with a spouse and kids? You can count them on one non-manicured hand if that. Thats the world Cody should have explored. Instead were stuck with a woefully underdeveloped self-pitying heroine. PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Not once does Ricki ever stand up for herself or dispense wisdom from the school of hard rocks. She lets her kids metaphorically walk all over her. She doesnt even have the nerve to snap back at her exs new wife (Audra McDonald) who chews her out for being a piss-poor absentee mom. All she can do is apologize slump her shoulders and head back to L.A. She reaches an emotional nadir on stage back at the dive bar. In a rambling sermon she rhapsodizes about Mick Jagger and snipes that nobody ever questions his devoted parenting skills because hes a man. That may be so Ricki. But he also fronts the most successful touring rock n roll band in history. That particular double-standard argument is thinner than a microphone stand. PHOTOS Stars who lost or gained weight for roles Meanwhile Cody never spells out why Linda uprooted to L.A. and rechristened herself as Ricki or more important why she never looked back. All we know about her resume is that she put out one album -- as in an actual vinyl record -- eons ago. A successful career never materialized. She makes ends meet by cashiering at a Whole Foods-like grocery store. So tell Us Why cant she perform cover songs in the Midwest? Certainly rent is cheaper. As for Streep? Well she might be able to carry a tune and strum a guitar. She might even look the part. But she looks visibly ill at ease passing herself off as a poor womans Melissa Etheridge. No encore please.

"Ricki and the Flash review Family affair falls flat - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Ricki and the Flash review Demme Cody collaboration falls flat Ricki and the Flash Bob Vergara / Sony Pictures Meryl Streep stars as a rock musician reuniting with her family in ""Ricki and the Flash."" Meryl Streep stars as a rock musician reuniting with her family in ""Ricki and the Flash."" (Bob Vergara / Sony Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Jonathan Demmes music/drama hybrid stars Meryl Streep. And yet it doesnt quite work. ""Ricki and the Flash"" comes from director Jonathan Demme whose good and great films include ""Melvin and Howard"" ""Swing Shift"" ""Stop Making Sense"" ""Something Wild"" ""Married to the Mob"" and seven years ago ""Rachel Getting Married."" (Hes made a few others of course among them ""The Silence of the Lambs"" which won him an Oscar.) Diablo Cody an Oscar winner for ""Juno"" and a fascinating purveyor of meanness and sincerity intertwined wrote the script.Meryl Streep who learned guitar for the role and channeled Bonnie Raitt Janis Joplin and various other goddesses for inspiration stars as a veteran of the lower end of the music industry. Ricki Rendazzo (born with the un-rocker name of Linda Brummell) is scraping by fronting a Tarzana Calif. bar band. She and her guitarist boyfriend played by Rick Springfield may be geographically close to Los Angeles but symbolically and economically theyre a million miles away. Ricki has an ex played by Kevin Kline a former free spirit now comfortably situated in an Indianapolis suburb with his second wife played by the luminous Audra McDonald. The ex calls Ricki who hasnt seen her three grown children in years after daughter Mamie (played by Streeps daughter Mamie Gummer) spirals into depression after being left by her husband. Its time for Ricki to reacquaint herself with the life and lives she put behind her for her career.Now I just listed a lot of very talented people all of whom surely tried to make ""Ricki and the Flash"" special and honest and engaging. Same with the Flash of the title. Rickis backup band includes Springfield on guitar the late Neil Young collaborator Rick Rosas on bass (he died shortly after filming) and Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic on keyboards. Streep sings several numbers as she has onscreen in everything from ""Ironweed"" to ""Postcards from the Edge"" to ""A Prairie Home Companion"" to mega-hit ""Mamma Mia"" Why does this film with so many first-rate artists in its corner not quite work?Partly its a matter of style but mostly its because the script is made of tin. Demme and company create a determinedly straight-ahead no-frills never-notice-a-single-shot showcase for Streep and the narrative serves the lead performance. Demmes near-shamanistic acumen in filming music serves him well here as always. He always seems to know when and where to cut when someones playing and/or singing for subtle emphasis.But Codys narrative groans and strains to get its act together. Working in a consciously warmer and less obviously quippy vein than any of her previous projects Cody lays out some potentially rich character details for its flawed charismatic protagonist. Shes an Obama hater with a ""Dont tread on me"" tattoo on her back. Thats one aspect of the woman; another emerges when Ricki notes that Mick Jagger ""had seven kids with four different women ... he didnt actually raise them but ..."" The speech gets sharper and angrier as it goes and its effective. But it sounds like a speech not a person and not the same person Ricki is elsewhere in her movie. All good protagonists are contradictory tangles of experience and disappointment but Cody is so tentative in her approach nothing gathers steam or sticks in emotional terms.

Meryl Streep (left) and Rick Springfield in ""Ricki and the Flash"" opening Friday. Photo Bob Vergara Associated Press Ricki is fine except when Streep is singing 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Meryl Streep can do anything but that doesnt mean she should do everything. As great actresses go shes a good singer but as singers go put it this way Few would pay to see a Meryl Streep rock concert. But thats what we get in ""Ricki and the Flash"" a decent family drama sandwiched in between two mediocre concerts with Streep fronting a bar band. After she sings one song (""American Girl"") at the top of the film we think fine we get it theyre showing this to establish the character and the situation. But when she starts singing another we understand. This is just the way its going to be. There is no one problem in these concert scenes but a combination of influences that make them something to endure not enjoy. Right off Streep enjoys singing so much it can make you nervous. The context is depressing lots of middle-aged and older sad sacks drinking in a mostly empty bar. The movie seems to be aiming to have it both ways that Rickis circumstances are pathetic but her aspirations are grand but the character is done in by the hair and makeup departments which turn her into a grotesque with half her head in tight braids that make her look like the Borg Queen. Add in that Streeps sweet thin voice is not suited to rock n roll and further factor in the natural dignity of the greatest actress of her time and the effect becomes a little like walking into a strip club and finding your mother up there. Even if she were good at it it wouldnt be any fun and Streep isnt really good at it. The pleasures of ""Ricki and the Flash"" are everything else particularly the long stretch in which Ricki is away from home and over a thousand blessed miles away from a microphone. Ricki (real name Linda) left her family in Indianapolis decades ago to become a rock star in Los Angeles. But when her ex-husband (Kevin Kline) tells her that their daughter (Mamie Gummer) is depressed after the collapse of her marriage Ricki flies back to Indianapolis. The sight of Streep playing opposite Gummer her own real-life look-alike daughter is pleasing in itself and Gummer is terrific with lots of wit comic timing and internal life. Streep doesnt walk off with their scenes. Its a tussle. Director Jonathan Demme clearly worked with the actors in refining the family dynamic so that we can understand for example a whole history behind Kevin Klines restrained performance -- that Ricki dumped him and that he made a much better life than he ever would have had with her and yet a part of him isnt quite over her. Diablo Codys script has flashes of wit and refreshing cultural references but it often aims for complexity and lands in ambiguity. Perhaps this isnt Codys doing but indicative of a tug-of-war between Codys script and Demmes direction Theres a scene of Ricki and the Flash playing at a wedding in which half the guests are scowling at her and yet the scene ends with a dance floor full of happy cavorting people. It doesnt help that Streeps singing makes it easier to believe the first reaction not the second. Rick Springfield best known for a string of hits in the 1980s plays Rickis lead guitarist and would-be boyfriend. Springfield is also an actor and he proves it throughout ""Ricki and the Flash"" but especially in one scene in which he talks about his kids and how he feels about them and how he feels about Ricki. It doesnt feel like an acting moment because he doesnt do the scene the way most actors would. It feels like youre seeing something precious happening between two people. If only Streep would have put down the microphone and let Springfield sing ""Jessies Girl"" ""Ricki and the Flash"" might have had half a chance.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Ricki Randazzo the middle-aged heroine of Jonathan Demmes minor domestic drama Ricki And The Flash is the kind of person who would be described as ""a character"" were she not already fictional. As the frontwoman of a bar band in Tarzana California she belts outs crowd-pleasing covers (""American Girl"" ""Wooly Bully"") in between bad stage patter and anti-Obama rants. She favors block heels ratty braids and blue mascara and has an ugly ""Dont Tread On Me"" back tattoo. She lives in one of those San Fernando Valley apartment complexes that looks like a motel and works check-out at a Whole Foods stand-in to make rent. As in Demmes best early work (Handle With Care Melvin amp; Howard) there is both an affection for a uniquely American type of oddball and a clear-eyed sense of their foibles. At least part of the credit belongs to screenwriter Diablo Cody who seems to have set out to write a greatest-hits Jonathan Demme movie--complete with full-length live musical numbers kitsch decor and a wedding--while taking another go at the basic premise of her script for Young Adult the story of a nobody returning to nowhere. Summoned by ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) Ricki (Meryl Streep) returns to the sleepy Indiana suburb she fled decades ago to spend time with youngest child Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps real-life daughter) who has just survived a suicide attempt. Theres long-standing tension between Ricki--real name Linda Brummel--and her three grown-up children effectively raised by stepmother Maureen (Audra McDonald) after Ricki went West to pursue a dream and fail. But aside from Julies husband who left her for another woman there are no villains--only people so hung up on how they wanted their lives to turn out that they end up hurting those around them sometimes subtly. Given that Demmes Stop Making Sense represents the high-water mark of the concert film as a genre it should come as no surprise that Ricki And The Flashs musical numbers--filmed live with Streep singing and playing rhythm guitar--are uniformly superb. (Bernie Worrell who played keyboards in Stop Making Sense is one of several veteran musicians cast as Rickis backing band The Flash; Rick Springfield plays her sweet slightly dopey guitarist-slash-boyfriend.) But as in much of the prolific directors later work one cant help but miss the creative contributions of Tak Fujimoto the cinematographer of most of Demmes best and best-known films including Melvin amp; Howard Something Wild Silence Of The Lambs and Beloved.Fujimotos shadowy visual sensibility was a unifying factor and without it Ricki And The Flash--which was shot by Declan Quinn Demmes go-to cinematographer in recent years--swings wildly between different conventional camera styles turning into a small-club concert doc for The Flashs regular gigs at The Salt Well or into stagey locked-down farce during the restaurant scene that introduces Ricki and Petes sons Joshua (Sebastian Stan) and Adam (Nick Westrate). What keeps the movie together instead are some complicated serio-comic performances especially from Kline and Streep the latter for once seemingly out of her comfort zone as a self-styled free spirit whose Tea Party leanings set her liberal Midwestern family on edge.Though best known for her arch dialogue Cody has a knack for location setting stories in sharply sketched places and clearly defined moments in characters lives--qualities that sometimes make Ricki And The Flash feel like a throwback to the minor-key American filmmaking of the 1970s when Demme first arrived on the scene. The same ear for the super-specific that informs Codys pop culture references (see Julie describing Ricki as looking like ""a hooker from Night Court"") gives her an edge when it comes to questions of class money and race even if the writing sometimes swings broad. Ricki And The Flash is a movie of things that may have been done better earlier--sometimes by Demme himself--but which are done all too rarely nowadays which makes it feel both retro and refreshing.

EntertainmentMovies Ricki and the Flash Meryl Streep is wickedly good Originally published August 6 2015 at 1205 am Updated August 6 2015 at 1110 am Meryl Streep plays a singer who left her family to pursue her dream in ""Ricki and the Flash."" (Bob Vergara) A review of ""Ricki and the Flash"" which stars Meryl Streep in another great performance as a small-time bar musician. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""I wanna get lost in your rock n roll and drift away ... "" sings Ricki (Meryl Streep) in an L.A. bar that hasnt been the place to be for a while and you see her living the lyrics She gets lost in the moment drifting away becoming something bigger and shinier and magical. Ricki whose real name is Linda has spent her life chasing stardom leaving her Midwestern family behind many years ago. There was a failed album long ago faded in the rearview mirror; now shes a supermarket cashier who by night fronts the house band -- Ricki and the Flash -- at the Salt Well. But when she sings shes transformed if only in her own mind. Watching ""Ricki and the Flash"" is an odd and surprisingly joyful experience; it seems particularly in its first half like youve seen it before and director Jonathan Demme brings an odd bit of rom-com glossiness to the filmmaking that doesnt suit its often painful story. But Streeps performance like lightning jolts everything. Ricki early on is summoned back to suburban Indianapolis by her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) whos long ago remarried; their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps real-life daughter) has moved back home and is struggling to face the aftermath of her own failed marriage. Can Ricki help? Probably not -- Julies resentments toward her absent mother could fill the Hollywood Bowl -- but shes coming anyway. The dialogue (by Diablo Cody) is snappy and the cast gives the immediate feel of two families the Indianapolis one headed by stodgy but well-meaning Pete and his warmhearted second wife Maureen (Audra McDonald); and the Salt Well group where even the patrons seem like theyve been there forever and where Rickis been having a casual but longtime fling with guitarist Greg (a charmingly low-key Rick Springfield). Gummer who looks and speaks uncannily like her ""Kramer vs. Kramer""-era mother gets the movies second-flashiest role and makes Julies volcanic anger something vivid and touching; you see where the apple fell. Movie Review    Ricki and the Flash with Meryl Streep Kevin Kline Mamie Gummer Rick Springfield Audra McDonald Sebastian Stan. Directed by Jonathan Demme from a screenplay by Diablo Cody. 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 for thematic material brief drug content sexuality and language. Several theaters. But this movie belongs as so many have to Streep who attacks the role of Ricki with wicked energy. This woman in her too-tight pants and high-heeled boots has a funnily stiff walk a raunchy little laugh and a lived-in voice that suggests too many nights in smoke-filled rooms. And while shes not very perceptive she does know that she failed her children and is desperate to shield herself from that pain. Yes she argues heatedly she was a terrible mother -- but Mick Jagger didnt raise his kids himself did he? Left hanging silently is the obvious reply Ricki whos staying at Petes house because she doesnt have the money for a motel is no Mick Jagger.

Photo Sony Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Ricki and the Flash Running time 96 minutes. Rated PG-13 (language drug use). ""Ricki and the Flash"" is about a woman divided Ricki (Meryl Streep) once a married Midwestern mother of three chucked it all to live as a near-penniless Los Angeles rocker. The movie itself seems equally divided between the sensibilities of hyperverbal writer Diablo Cody and music-centric director Jonathan Demme and ends up falling into a muddy gap between the two. Fortunately Streep is incapable of giving a half-assed performance even in a sub-par role. She nails the music wailing on the electric guitar and honing her vocal chops into a rockers growl. Adding to the appeal is her real-life daughter Mamie Gummer as her volatile offspring while longtime co-star Kevin Kline (""Sophies Choice"") is her ex. But nothing can rescue the film which critically fails to flesh out Rickis character. Or did Demme assume wed be so transfixed by Streeps weirdly awful side braids we wouldnt notice? Mamie Gummer (left) and Meryl StreepPhoto Sony Pictures We first meet Ricki as shes belting out ""American Girl"" with her band in a dive bar. Beloved by a handful of regulars shes Hedwig-esque -- a wannabe legend giving it her all as if ""shes playing Madison Square Garden."" A call from her ex Pete (Kline) summons Ricki back to Indiana where their daughter Julie (Gummer) has attempted suicide after her husband left her. Gummer is arresting as a wild-haired depressive who rages at her absentee mother but the film becomes strangely slippery in its depiction of Rickis return Its as if every scenes cut off right before something illuminating is said. A tense dinner with Julies brothers Joshua and Adam (Sebastian Stan and Nick Westrate) reveals little more than that Rickis not on the guest list for Joshuas upcoming wedding -- and that she is rather improbably a Republican. Its only when Kline and Streep are alone together smoking pot late at night that you really feel some magic. Too soon Petes wife (Audra McDonald) sends Ricki back to Los Angeles where she negotiates a deepening relationship with her guitarist (a graceful Rick Springfield) and grieves over her lost family. In a rare highlight she rants onstage about how Mick Jagger can father children he never raised and still be ""the MAN"" For women meanwhile ""God forbid you miss one PTA meeting -- congratulations youre a monster."" That Ricki will return for her sons wedding is inevitable if contrived. Despite its heartfelt performances and fine classic rock covers ""Ricki"" is merely a second-rate dramedy with more fizzle than flash.

Theres 66-year-old Meryl Streep playing a broke singer who ditched her family to dominate the stage with the whiskey growl of Janis Joplin the jangly jewelry and thigh-high boots of Hearts Nancy Wilson the side-swept hairdo of Bananarama and the swagger of Courtney Love. She puts these totems of the goddesses to use covering Lady Gaga for the youngsters in the crowd -- that is if a ""crowd"" entails two dozen barflies in Tarzana. Demme himself doesnt seem to get out much. Here college kids hang at out-of-the-way Valley bars with people three times their age while 50-year-old white men recoil from Bruce Springsteen as though hes as outrageous as Gwar.What year is it? Who can tell. The confusion is both accidental -- like the scene that hinges on the illegality of gay marriage shot months before the Supreme Courts landmark ruling -- and intentional as Ricki herself refuses to obey time. She likes her pants tight and her mascara thick. Shes draped in 15 necklaces and studded with nine rings in each ear. And in a middle finger to life post-9/11 she doesnt give a damn if that makes her a pain in the ass to airport security. Ricki rejects growing old. Or rather shes oblivious to what we expect old people to be. Ricki locks eyes with a prim grandmother and they blink at each other uncomprehendingly. And when she walks -- not struts simply walks -- past men her own age they scowl. How dare she break the rules?Demmes film plays out like a catnapping afternoon dream. We recognize the world yet the logic is screwy. You cant convince me those men wouldnt check out her ass. But the broad strokes of Rickis life have truth. Women -- especially of her era -- are supposed to grow up play nice and stay home. Those who leave their husband and three kids as Ricki did 20 years before the movie starts are demonized. But thats not the only consequence she faces for ditching Indianapolis to follow her dreams She has sacrificed her past and kneecapped her future trading a McMansion for a rat-trap California apartment with rusted railings and her ex Petes big bank account for a grocery cashier gig where she makes 447.74 a week.Film Details Ricki and the Flash RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time102 min. More Info Trailer Whats refreshing about Diablo Codys script is that Ricki never feels a lick of regret. Onstage shes aglow -- even if afterward her on-again off-again boyfriend (Rick Springfield) cracks ""She thinks this is Madison Square Garden.""Related StoriesJanis Little Girl Blue Explores Joplins Sadness But Leaves the Rest of Her UnexaminedThe plot kicks off when Rickis daughter Julie (real-life Streep scion Mamie Gummer) attempts suicide after her husband leaves her for another woman forcing her estranged mom to fly home to provide comfort -- or really a fresh target for Julies wrath.Gummer enters the film like a demon hair matted sweatpants unwashed scowl affixed. You can practically smell her through the screen. Other movies would pressure Ricki to fix her ""mistake"" -- say quitting the band for a triumphant family hug with her at the center buried in a sweater vest and pearls. But this flick loves its leading banshees even if Gummer sidles out of the story too soon. Before that Ricki and Julie skulk around Indianapolis gorging on doughnuts getting witchy manicures and frightening the squares. And where Ricki cant compute basic bitches Demme despises them.The movie is at war with itself You sense Cody wanting to tell a rich story about a rebel with flaws. Yet Demme sprints through Rickis sins crowns her a saint and spends the rest of the film taking potshots at women with stick-figure families on their cars women who tie cardigans around their necks or decorate their homes with signs squealing ""I would give up chocolate but Im not a quitter."" If only Demme had shot a scene of Ricki stubbing out a joint on a Cathy comic strip.Mostly Ricki and the Flash is a throwback to Reagan-era comedies that mocked the millionaires and celebrated the broke. Ricki may be a time blender but Demmes worldview is totally 1985 -- despite a sly aside that Ricki Queen of the Kooks voted for George W. Bush twice. ""I support our troops"" she shrugs and has an American-flag back tat to prove it. Only an actress with Streeps charm could diss Barack Obama tack on a sarcastic ""No offense"" to her bands black keyboardist and still win back the liberal arthouse crowd.

But its biggest statement is a quick sharp dig when Ricki takes the stage to point out that Mick Jagger has seven kids by four women and no one tells him to quit rock for parenthood. The ladies in the bar somberly nod. Then Rickis guitarist boyfriend silences her by joking ""Youre scaring some of the guys up here"" Even with a mic Ricki cant get heard.

From Jonathan Demme a director with an impossibly rich resume of female empowerment (Married to the Mob) musical euphoria (Stop Making Sense) and failed American dreams (Melvin and Howard) comes a movie that lets him do everything hes terrific at. Throw in Demmes The Silence of the Lambs too as scruffy bar-band front woman Ricki Randazzo (Meryl Streep) tears into Tom Pettys jangly ""American Girl"" with a dead-eyed survivors stare. Sarcastic bitter and chatty Ricki barely holds onto her corporate grocery checkout job during the daytime but those liabilities become assets at night when her local fans howl appreciatively through the hits. Demmes never been a hater and even as Meryl Streep flings off weird sparks to her grizzled band mates the Flash theres an underlying realness to her that defies glibness. This zesty defiantly awkward shambles of a film might be called a domestic drama as it plucks its penniless main character from her beer-soaked California stage and sends her to the Midwest to deal with her wealthy ex-husband (Kevin Kline playing off Streep as tenderly as in Sophies Choice) and their suicidal adult daughter (Mamie Gummer Streeps real-life progeny) a victim of Rickis long-ago abandonment. Tough stares and words await very much of a piece with screenwriter Diablo Codys earlier credits especially the underrated Young Adult to which this feels a similarly arrested cousin. But that hardly does justice to a movie that gives Streep her most emotionally blocked character in years without caricature. Shes graced by an angel at her side (Rick Springfield superb with a touch of gray) and finds her way to the soul of several songs. Theres devastating connection and tears in these moments delicate gratitude in ""Drift Away"" nothing short of maternal redemption in a roaring version of Bruce Springsteens ""My Love Will Not Let You Down."" As the band plays on you wonder if thats all a film really needs.

Diablo Codys warm and occasionally cheeky screenplay follows the usual sentimental beats with standard Cody snark sprinkled liberally throughout. Director Jonathan Demme transforms the material into an infectious treatise on the healing power of music often hijacking the entire narrative in favor of a concert film as is his wont. Meanwhile Meryl Streep -- as the titular Ricki -- beams for the camera and shows off her singing range veering from overly glamorous to spectacularly in the moment and back again. In other words everyones doing their usual thing not always in perfect harmony but with plenty of vigor. This trifecta of influences is clear from the opening scene as Ricki belts out a jumpy cover of Tom Pettys ""American Girl"" alongside her lively guitarist (Rick Springfield an inspired choice) at the drab Los Angeles pub where her group serves as the house band. Its one of several times in which Demme allows the band to play a tune all the way through. Captured with a restless shaky cam style and ample closeups of the blue collar audience the sequence at first resembles one of Demmes Neil Young documentaries where the music runs the show. But then the song ends and Codys screenplay takes over with Rickis awkward stage banter showing her uneven state. After casually directing a racist inference at her black keyboardist and showing her Republican colors she gets into an awkward spat with her guitarist about whether or not theyre an item off-stage. The scene culminates with the fragment of the bands next song -- a Lady Gaga cover -- and the formula is complete Demme wants to celebrate the music Codys more interested in denigrating her lead and Streep just looks thrilled to toy with the wildly different sensibilities in play. Then the real story kicks in and for a while ""Ricki and the Flash"" sags into a basic formula. Rickis pulled away from her bland day job at the checkout counter of a local supermarket to take an urgent call from her wealthy ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) who urges her to return to the Indianapolis home she abandoned years ago in pursuit of her career ambitions. Their twentysomething daughter Julie (Streeps daughter Mamie Gummer in their third onscreen collaboration) has been abruptly dumped by her husband for another woman. With Petes newer wife (Audra McDonald) out of town he desperately needs a womans touch and begs Ricki to come help. So begins an uneasy odyssey in which the leather-clad foul-mouthed Ricki awkwardly attempts to insert herself into a palatial white collar setting and make peace with her neglectful ways. The set-up bears a marked similarity to Codys screenplay for ""Young Adult"" in which another aging basketcase returns to her old haunts and resurrects painful memories. However ""Ricki and the Flash"" eventually veers away from the sheer spiteful elements of ""Young Adult"" and becomes a tamer ""Rachel Getting Married"" focusing on familial discord with an almost operatic quality as various awkward exchanges take on more complex manifestations through performance. When ""Ricki and the Flash"" pierces its conventional trajectory with music it gets more interesting. But the fluff surrounding it holds together well enough. Once Ricki arrives in Indianapolis her rocky relationship with her troubled daughter erupts into pure chaos. Mother and daughter (onscreen and off) clearly seem to enjoy trading barbs and the standard bonding process is frequently interrupted by Codys penchant for cheeky one-liners. (""Do you always dress like a hooker from Night Court""?) Their initial challenges dovetail into much broader issues between Ricki and the rest of her family when the group sits down for a hectic dinner. Its here that she swallows the news of one sons homosexuality and learns she hasnt been invited to her other sons upcoming wedding. Despite these tough odds Ricki attempts to regain her maternal role with darkly comical results. Just when the cycle of arguments grows tedious ""Ricki and the Flash"" switches modes. A late night marijuana session back at the house finds Ricki performing an acoustic rendition of ""Takes a Cold One to Know One"" an original composition thats among the films standout moments. But once Petes wife sends Ricki packing the movie finally develops into an engaging compassionate portrait of a woman alienated by her aspirations. Its here that Streep shows remarkable chemistry with Springfield whose grizzled appearance and equally somber family history makes him a perfect match for Rickis troubled history. Demme allows their uneven romance to play out over the course of several songs finding more subtleties in their relationship than words could allow. Rickis entire backstory -- leaving her domestic life to pursue a dream -- mimics the films tension between a traditional melodramatic tropes and the more sophisticated process of exploring those same tropes through music. While often at odds with one another those two forces ultimately synch up for a climax that threatens to turn cheesy at any moment but instead hits on an emotional clarity that most of the dialogue scenes lack. As usual Streep doesnt easily burrow inside her showy performance but she certainly can sing. Its unusual to see a summer studio movie so enamored of musics storytelling possibilities but ""Ricki and the Flash"" joins ""Trainwreck"" and ""Magic Mike XXL"" in this summers trend of light fare with vibrant musical finales. This one stumbles more often than the others but as with Rickis own troubled path the songs carry it. Grade B ""Ricki and the Flash"" opens nationwide on August 7.

She did very well in her portrayal of Ricki. I disagree with the reviewer this film deserves an ""A"". It was funny in parts and horribly uncomfortable in other parts - the fact that it can provoke such varied emotions is what makes is such a remarkable work. Reply Therese May 12 2016 616 pm Great review. Meryl is great actor. But not all is work is top quality. However she brings enough talent to the film to make it good enough to watch it and enjoy.

Movie review Ricki and the Flash Article Tweet Sony Pictures Releasing Meryl Streep in Ricki and the Flash Ricki and the Flash    (out of five) Director Jonathan Demme Cast Meryl Streep Kevin Kline Mamie Gummer Rating PG-13 (thematic material brief drug content sexuality and language) Run time 101 min. By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 408pm on Wednesday Aug. 05 2015 Wednesday Aug. 05 2015 Friday Aug. 07 2015 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram Like a cover band tackling a well-worn tune Ricki and the Flash doesnt sing you anything new or different but instead tries to put its own spin on very familiar material.Meryl Streep stars as Ricki Rendazzo a singer-songwriter eking out a living in Southern California as a grocery-store employee by day and barroom rocker by night. Having kept her bandmate and occasional lover Greg (Rick Springfield) at arms length her laid-back life is shaken up when she learns of a family crisis back home in Indianapolis.Ricki is really Linda Brummel a suburban housewife whose dreams of rock stardom ripped her away from her family decades ago leaving still-raw wounds. Her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) is trying to manage their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) in the wake of her sudden divorce. Thrust back into the conservative Midwest Ricki/Linda struggles to find acceptance from her family while working through her own emotional turmoil.Films about family struggles and the challenges of parenthood are one of Hollywoods most reliable exports and despite its impressive pedigree -- Ricki stars three-time Oscar winner Streep is directed by another Oscar winner in Jonathan Demme who is working from a screenplay authored by Oscar winner Diablo Cody -- Ricki and the Flash cant really transcend its Lifetime-ish limitations. Not that the excellent cast doesnt give it a try Streep no stranger to singing on screen sells Ricki as a self-described ""broken person"" while Gummer Streeps real-life daughter works to overcome her thinly written role.Gummer isnt alone. Just about every character from Klines workaholic ex-husband to Nick Westrates out-and-proud son Adam suffers from an alarming lack of depth. Everyone has their moment of clarity when the narrative calls for it and Ricki is more or less wrapped up in a big saccharine bow. The film roars to life too intermittently -- an electrifying confrontation between Streep and Audra McDonald playing Petes second wife Maureen; a scene late in the film where Ricki and Greg convey their intense feelings for each other in the midst of performing Dobie Grays Drift Away is deeply moving -- but sadly too much of Ricki and the Flash is just the same old song.

Like David Bowie joining Bing Crosby for a medley of Christmas carols ""Ricki and the Flash"" combines a number of promising elements that dont seem to have any business being anywhere near each other though the disconnect exerts a strange appeal all its own. Offering half an acerbic family dramedy (from screenwriter Diablo Cody in ""Young Adult"" mode) and half a Jonathan Demme-directed concert pic that just happens to feature Meryl Streep as the frontwoman this is a shaggy easily distractible film that consistently defies expectations to both charming and baffling effect. Whether audiences will know what to make of it is an open question -- if the actual film is a collision of several clashing tones its trailer introduces a different one entirely -- though acolytes of the Cult of Meryl could rally some support at the box office. Streep bravely courts and often achieves ridiculousness in the lead role as Ricki Rendazzo (a.k.a. Linda Brummell) a sixtysomething failed rock star. In between stints working the register at a Whole Foods-esque yuppie-mart Ricki fronts a Tarzana bar band whove recently been forced to broaden their repertoire from 70s AOR standards to the likes of Lady Gaga and Pink. The band sounds pretty great -- and well it should with the late Neil Young collaborator Rick Rosas on bass Parliament-Funkadelics synth-pioneer Bernie Worrell on keyboards and Rick Springfield on lead guitar -- but Rickis personal life is torn and frayed. Shes eternally broke; shes afraid to commit to her bandmate-boyfriend Greg (Springfield); and its been years since shes spoken to her three adult children whom she ditched long ago to chase stardom in California. (Despite her flower-child-gone-leather demeanor and copious Janis jewelry shes also an Obama-hating Republican with the Gadsden flag tattooed on her back a detail that feels nicely attuned to classic rock radios shifting demographics.) One day Ricki gets a call from her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline a vision of oddly serene punctiliousness in resplendent sweater vests) who tells her that their daughter Julie (Streep scion Mamie Gummer) is on the verge of both a divorce and a psychic breakdown refusing to shower or change out of her pajamas. Ricki jets off to Indiana to visit though she cant pay for the cab or a hotel and crashes in Petes gated-community mansion while his new wife (Audra McDonald) is away. Julie responds to her mothers re-emergence with a mixture of scorn and cautious optimism while Rickis youngest son Adam (Nick Westrate) needles her about her unevolved attitude toward homosexuality and older son Josh (Sebastian Stan) tries to be diplomatic while secretly hoping to avoid inviting her to his upcoming wedding to an uptight environmentalist (Hailey Gates). These domestic scenes are vintage Cody cluttered with arch banter that hits and misses in equal measure yet adroitly exacting in tracing the precise degrees of tension that are applied and relieved with each snippy exchange. Gradually Julie and Ricki start to make up for lost time while Pete begins to feel some stirrings for his ex and both threads come to an amiably low-key head when the three break into Petes pot stash. Then the arrival of Petes wife abruptly breaks the spell sapping narrative momentum along the way. Ricki heads back to California and the film begins spinning its wheels for an extended period switching the focus to Ricki and Gregs rather blase romance with one long musical number after another pulling the film further and further away from wherever it had been ever so gradually heading. The pic gathers itself together well enough to stage a blowout climax throwing all of its disparate elements into a big Bollywoodish blender (theres even a group dance number) but once the credits roll its hard to pin down exactly what story the filmmakers were trying to tell. ""Ricki and the Flash"" has much to admire but little to hold onto. At one point Ricki suffers a minor onstage meltdown that tries to spell out a number of the storys themes. ""Mick Jagger had seven kids with four different women"" she begins innocently enough before adding ""he didnt actually raise them but ... "" and then veers off into an alternately righteous and self-serving rant about the free pass men often receive for abdicating family responsibilities. Its a nuanced well-written piece of dialogue but it doesnt really get us any closer to understanding why Ricki did what she did or feeling one way or the other about it. This issue extends to Streeps performance which compiles a wealth of impressive actorly attributes without ever really finding a center for the character. She learned to play guitar for the role sings distinctively and crafts her own Bonnie Raitt-esque onstage stance but shes never really believable as a rock and roll lifer. Theres a lightness an unblemished sort of effervescence to her that even multimillionaire superstars would struggle to maintain after so many tours and late nights never mind someone whos been living hand-to-mouth for decades. She brings plenty of salt but not nearly enough grit. Its been 30 years since Demme directed ""Stop Making Sense"" but hes lost little of his preternatural instincts for how to film a live performance -- even when the band sequences distract theyre never less than thrillingly shot and staged -- and Streep delivers a lovely acoustic take on Jenny Lewis and Johnathan Rices ""Cold One"" written specifically for the film.

That being said this movie is like a bizzaro version of her. This movie was a waste of my time and I was so let down. The film just never gets you and its really a depressing story. I got the whole society judging the singer who is different thing but i just thought it was lame all around. Poor Rick Springfield looked like he was miserable the entire time. I cant believe the man that directed Silence of The Lambs made this awful movie. Please Meryl dont start doing terrible movies like Johnny Depp. Reply Donna G Bradshaw says May 5 2016 at 604 pm I absolutely loved this movie. Meryl is a STAR Reply Jamie Guth says January 9 2016 at 915 am This review almost gets it. Watch Kramer vs Kramer and you will see the same issue just 40 years later. Meryl Streep was the wife who had to leave her husband and young son to figure out who she was and what she needed. It was an excellent film that addressed really important gender issues -- on the roles of both men and women as parents. Ricky is about that woman in many respects and whats happened to her showing that there is still work to do. What if she had been a successful singer? Would this be more acceptable in our culture? Reply dave says August 22 2015 at 929 am Isnt Streep a little too old to be playing an aging rocker? Reply Pat says August 18 2015 at 517 pm I just went with friend to see this. I absolutely loved it and would see itagai. Reply Michelle says August 8 2015 at 605 am Just saw this movie last night and I thought it was great. I am a 57 year old woman and I found myself reminiscing during it. I thought everyone and definitely Streep did a GREAT job. Maybe it is not for the 20 year olds but if you are over 40 and looking for a movie that will entertain consider this. There are enough of us out there that maybe we can get the numbers up to make the Academy look at this movie for Oscars for Streep and the actress who plays her daughter. Dont listen to some of the previous comments especially since most havent even given it a chance. Reply Amanda Bonner says August 6 2015 at 744 pm Movie sounds like a dud with a lot of very predictable situations. Repug who hates gays and is a lifelong rocker who ditched her kids for the road and hookups and pot (wow -- where did those ""family values"" go?). Someone please tell Streep to stop singing in movies and to only accept roles that sort of fit her age and dramatic talent. Reply David Johnson says December 31 2015 at 1011 pm Actually rock critics gave her a thumbs up for her singing. I enjoyed it but then again I actually watched the movie before commenting on it. You want her only to accept roles that fit her age and dramatic talent? This is a movie about an aging rocker. Aging. Seems to fit. As far as dramatic talent goes? Part of being talented allows a person to play a wide variety of roles. Shes known for doing this. She celebrated for doing this. Other than that amost perspicacious commentary on your part. Reply nova rae says December 30 2015 at 917 pm if u havent seen the movie then dont comment Reply S. A. Young says August 4 2015 at 529 am I had a pass for a screening last night that I couldnt make (I already knew I didnt want to pay to see it) but from all reports I didnt miss anything. A Meryl Streep movie opening in August is not a good sign. Reply Victoria says August 4 2015 at 510 am Trailer looks horrible. Seems like a vanity project for Streep. I ll pass Reply Thank You Detective says August 4 2015 at 447 am I dont care about the review or the movie. They gave away the ending in the trailer. What a bunch of amateurs. Reply Kurt says August 4 2015 at 320 am Man I love me some Meryl Streep. And if anyone could salvage a movie named ""Ricki and the Flash"" she could. But somehow this just sounds like a 2 or 2 and a half star time-filler. I really wanted to be all-in with this film but it looks like things are headed the other way...unfortunately. Reply Dan says August 4 2015 at 140 am Maybe if the trailer didnt show the whole movie I may have be interested in watching it. Reply Sanmant says August 3 2015 at 1128 pm I saw Ricki and the flash and I thought that Meryl Streep sucked as a rock star. You could tell that she hadnt lived the life. Where as Rick Springfield looked like he belonged in a rock band because he did live the life. he was great Reply chris says August 10 2015 at 1011 am i completely agree Reply See All 16 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO President On Vinyls Demise On-Screen Violence -TCA Tyler Posey Teen Wolf Star Regrets Im Gay Video -- I Am...

"Streep finds her inner rocker in Ricki and the Flash | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Streep finds her inner rocker in Ricki and the Flash By LINDSEY BAHR Aug. 4 2015 401 AM EDT Early on in ""Ricki and the Flash"" Ricki (Meryl Streep) gets a call that disarms her before shes even decided to pick it up. With smoky eyes braided rocker hair and a swagger that suggests skin thats as thick as her leather pants this doesnt seem like a woman who would back down from a challenge.She hesitates more than once to pick it up -- you get the sense that shes either become accustomed to being scolded by the voice on the other end of the line or has just given up on dealing with that other life completely. Its a small but telling moment in a lovely film laced with intensely human details that allow the audience the opportunity to actually know its characters in ways that so many films come up short.The voice on the line is her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) and father of her three grown children. Hes asking her to come back to Indiana. Their daughters husband has left her shes a wreck and Ricki needs to help.Only a few minutes into the movie were well on our way to understanding Ricki. Weve just seen her hold the attention of a small but enthusiastic audience at a Tarzana neighborhood bar as the lead singer of a rock cover band and then suffer through but tolerate her day job as a clerk at a Los Angeles Whole Foods stand-in with a smirk and an attitude.Although there are surprises to come its one of the more precise and effective introductions to a character in recent memory. Theres no exposition. No voiceover. Its all story advancing character specifics that are amplified by Streeps layered performance as this broke 60-something woman with the spirit and soul of a rebellious stargazing teenager.When her cab pulls up to Petes palatial suburban mansion she gets out bags and guitar in hand and asks him for the fare. Hes not surprised.Such a concoction could only come from (or at least make it to the screen via) the mind of ""Juno"" and ""Young Adult"" screenwriter Diablo Cody cinemas songstress of defiant women.Rickis arrival is a tumultuous one as she attempts to reintegrate herself ever so briefly in the lives of the family she left and attempt to restore the broken Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps real life daughter). Everyone has moved on and no one is afraid to tell her that.It sounds like the stuff of melodrama but in the hands of director Jonathan Demme the story chugs along naturally and subtly with the characters -- from an awkward showdown at a fancy restaurant to a nostalgia and marijuana-fueled night of bonding over stories and home videos.In fact all of the relationships are given an unexpected texture and depth from the ex-husbands new wife and surrogate mother to the children Maureen (Audra McDonald) to Rickis more-than-a-friend bandmate Greg (Rick Springfield).But its Gummer Streep and Kline who you wish the camera spent more time with especially together. Also beyond the mesmerizing physical resemblance between the real-life mother and daughter pairing Gummer and Streep both disappear into their respective roles. It helps probably that they dont pair up on screen in this capacity often.The only real contrivance is a late in the film wedding and a third act montage of growth that feels rushed where nothing else did.Ultimately spending time with these people is pleasant lived-in honest and even thought-provoking. And when the dialogue stops theres a fun golden not-too-oldies live music soundtrack to hum along with too.""Ricki and the Flash"" a Sony Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""thematic material brief drug content sexuality and language.""

TWITTER Meryl Streep rocks out as a bar-band musician whos forced to confront the family she left behind in Jonathan Demmes new film. Meryl Streep adds rhythm guitarist and rock-band frontwoman to her list of accomplishments handling both with born-to-it panache in Ricki and the Flash. The musical sequences are the comic dramas most persuasive elements. Thats no surprise given director Jonathan Demmes affinity for the art form well evidenced in landmark documentaries like Stop Making Sense. Its a testament too to his undying faith in the curative power of rock n roll. Like the cover band at its center the story of a convention-defying womans redemption in the eyes of her family plays to the center in its aim to please. The screenplay by Diablo Cody doesnt cut as deep as it might yet its combination of the glib and the bittersweet as filtered through Demmes earnest lens is sure to connect with audiences -- especially older viewers eager to see the star mixing it up with her real-life daughter Mamie Gummer and 80s poster boy Rick Springfield. But even with its well-observed moments the movies nonmusical interactions whether reaching for laughs or poignancy too often feel flat and forced. The narrative contrivance is shakiest at the storys center. An offscreen suicide attempt is the unconvincing plot engine that brings Streeps Ricki (nee Linda) Rendazzo from Los Angeles to Indianapolis the place where she was once a wife and full-time mother. A musician who scrapes together a living more or less as a supermarket cashier shes summoned by her ex Pete (Kevin Kline) a gentle and tentative man whos at a loss to help their daughter Julie (Gummer) despondent after the sudden end of her marriage. Read more Critics Picks Forget Ricki -- See These Jonathan Demme Films Instead In her rocker duds Ricki arrives penniless at Petes gated community. Shes a middle-aged variation on a fairy-tale heroine an experienced innocent in a strange land. Streep navigates the discomfort zone beautifully suggesting not just the wide-eyed unease of a bankrupt woman stepping into a McMansion but also the confidence of someone who on her own turf can handle a crowd with a cool assurance that brings to mind Bonnie Raitt. Ricki and the four-man Flash are the house band at a San Fernando Valley bar where the bartender (Ben Platt) is one of the few people under 40. Between Boomer-friendly covers her stage patter with smitten lead guitarist Greg (Springfield) has lately taken on a personal edge the commitment-phobic Ricki doing her offhandedly cruel best to keep him at arms length. Even when their characters are at odds the two actors click onstage. Offstage is another matter. A turning point between them is one of many moments that Demme overplays. Much of the movies strain lies in the thinness of its supporting characters particularly Rickis two sons who like Julie are leery of a woman who left them in order to pursue her musical dream. Sebastian Stan (the Winter Soldier in Captain America) plays the more forgiving of the two although he and his uptight fiancee (Hailey Gates) have no intention of inviting Ricki to their wedding. The outright hostile Adam (Nick Westrate) is equally lacking in dimension. Read more Rick Springfield on Acting Opposite Meryl Streep ""My Deer-in-the-Headlights Look Wasnt Going to Work"" But amid the pat differences between Ricki and the Indianans Cody and Demme slyly upend stereotypes. Beneath her leather jacket Ricki sports an American flag tattoo and votes Republican. And while the film does its utmost to signal that Petes second wife Maureen -- whose plot-necessity absence during Julies crisis instigates his call to Ricki -- is a typical country-club Caucasian she turns out to be Audra McDonald. Her House Beautiful perfectionism notwithstanding Maureen is tough-minded and anything but cartoonish. The two womens climactic confrontation hits things rather squarely on the head but Streep and McDonald find the right notes of passive aggression. Read more  Venice Film Festival Jonathan Demme Named President of Horizons Jury Not counting Gummers debut as a toddler in Heartburn this is the first film in which she and Streep share scenes. They create a frayed but hopeful connection. Although shes required to enter the action at a fever pitch of belligerence Gummer ratchets down the shrillness to let Julies pain surface in dark bursts of anger. Spending her first few scenes as an unwashed wreck with a frightening bedhead Julies convincingly indifferent to everything but her own suffering. As she demonstrated in A Prairie Home Companion Mamma Mia and Into the Woods Streep is a strong and joyful singer. Here she also holds her own as an instrumentalist with a quartet of pros including veteran sidemen Bernie Worrell Joe Vitale and bassist Rick Rosas a frequent Neil Young collaborator who died not long after the film wrapped and to whom its dedicated. Recorded live and dynamically shot by DP Declan Quinn the musical performances have a vividness and energy thats missing elsewhere. In Stuart Wurtzels production design and the costumes by Ann Roth the opposing forces in Rickis life are clearly expressed dark bar and brightly lit day job; tiny L.A. apartment and the spacious Indiana home where another woman has raised her children. Left to face the choices shes made Ricki ultimately gets to save the day while staying true to herself. That might feel like a cheat if not for Streeps unapologetic portrait of a woman who refuses to be defeated.

But thats essentially what she does in every film she appears in sprinkle the pixie dust of her ineffable Streep-ness over even the most banal scripts and underwritten roles. Ricki and the Flash isnt a great movie; its archetypes are tired and its plot turns textbook. But she commits utterly to Ricki an aging free spirit attempting to reconnect with her three adult children years after leaving them behind to pursue rock stardom. That sacrifice hasnt landed her much beyond a dumpy L.A. apartment a weekly gig cranking out Tom Petty covers for drowsy barflies in Tarzana and a sweet but equally broke boyfriend-slash-bandmate (Rick Springfield). When a family emergency calls her back to Indiana she can barely afford the ticket and its clear how poorly she fits into the Midwestern propriety of her old life; with her thumb rings spiky side braids and smudged eyeliner she looks like Stevie Nicks insolvent sister. Director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Diablo Cody both Oscar winners have made far better films. Still Ricki raises smart questions about why a mothers musical ambitions are so much more selfish than say seven-time dad Mick Jaggers and even the shamelessly corny sing-along finale wrings a few real tears out. Or maybe its just the pixie dust.

With ""Ricki and the Flash"" screenwriter Diablo Cody and director Jonathan Demme get together for a jam session thats all snippets and no hit singles. Theres an idea for a movie here about a woman who abandons her husband and kids to pursue her rock and roll dreams only to come home later for a family crisis; throw in some confrontations and some redemption; and presumably youve got a story. What we get from Cody and Demme feels more like an assemblage of almost-characters in an almost-story resulting in a very disappointing almost-movie. Certainly the role of Ricki Rendazzo formerly known as Linda Brummel seemed on paper to be another great showcase for Meryl Streep and the actress does what she can with a role thats not only sketchy and inconsistent but also forces her to wear the screens most hideous braids since Ewan McGregor in ""The Phantom Menace."" Streep has a gift for making us believe in her performance from moment to moment even when by the final encore we realize that we dont believe in the woman shes playing. See Video Meryl Streep Plays a Rockstar-Mom in New Ricki and the Flash Trailer (Video) Decades after ditching her family to attempt to make it big in Los Angeles Ricki gets a call from her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline reuniting with his ""Sophies Choice"" co-star) to return to the Midwest to visit their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer Streeps real-life progeny) whos suicidally depressed after being abandoned by her husband. Theres a weird ""Stella Dallas"" vibe to this section with bankrupt grocery store cashier Ricki oohing and aahing over Petes gated-community lifestyle but given that Ricki was once married to Pete it would make more sense for the character to be returning to her past rather than beaming in from another planet. Ricki bull-in-a-china-shops her way through the whole movie as though she had never experienced Petes world before fleeing it. (Speaking of the class struggle the film includes a scene in which a veteran rocker is gobsmacked to learn that the drinks at a wedding are free despite the fact that hes probably attended a few nuptials in a professional capacity over the years.) The visit also allows Ricki to catch up with her sons Adam (Nick Westrate) is gay and embittered while Josh (Sebastian Stan ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") is passive-aggressive and about to marry snotty Emily (Hailey Gates) in a ceremony about which Ricki has not been informed and to which she has not been invited. (Did I mention that the movie makes Ricki an arch-conservative and then does almost nothing with that information?) ""Ricki and the Flash"" is the kind of film where characters do a 180 from angry to adoring on a dime when the scene calls for it where complicated emotional conflicts are settled with one pleasant conversation and where even the lead characters ultimate act of generosity -- involving you guessed it Ricki singing -- is really at its heart another desperate attempt to become the focus of attention. See Video National Geographics Destination Wild Features Meryl Streeps Butterflies Angry Birds in Summer Slate (Exclusive Video) (In Demmes ""Rachel Getting Married"" the long musical sequences completely interrupted the flow of the storytelling but since ""Ricki"" has so little plot or momentum to speak of the interludes featuring the titular band have nothing to interrupt.) Theres one scene in which Ricki and boyfriend Greg (Rick Springfield currently having a moment between this and ""True Detective"") communicate mutual respect and adoration with their eyes while making their way through ""Drift Away"" but for the most part the musical bits are inoffensive but negligible. (To its credit the movie never pretends that this band is too good to be playing covers in the San Fernando Valley even though Streeps backing players include legends like Bernie Worrell and the late Rick Rosas.) See Video Meryl Streep Carey Mulligan Fight for Womens Rights in First Suffragette Trailer (Video) There are moments that work in ""Ricki"" -- an awkward family dinner a scene featuring Charlotte Rae as Petes senile mother a confrontation between Ricki and Petes second wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) -- but they play like discrete bit of pleasure that dont add up to anything. Its fine to forfeit elements like stakes or suspense for a character piece but when the characters are this vague theres nothing on which to hang your hat (or headband for that matter). Future editors of Meryl Streep Lifetime Achievement Award montages will no doubt find good use for the sequences where the star croons Pink or Bruce Springsteen but until then ""Ricki and the Flash"" represents a B-side cut for all involved one not worth playing. Email 40 Best and Worst Actors Playing Real-Life Musicians (Photos) The 1950s biopic ""The Glenn Miller Story"" took substantial liberties with the real story but Jimmy Stewart was persuasive enough as the star bandleader to make the movie a big hit. Universal If youre looking for somebody to play Hank Williams the haunted skeletal composer of such heartbreak classics as this 1964 movies title track ""Your Cheatin Heart"" George Hamilton is not exactly the guy who first springs to mind.MGMWe knew Diana Ross could sing after her string of hits in the 60s but we didnt know she could act until she made an astounding film debut as the tortured Billie Holiday in 1972s  ""Lady Sings the Blues.""Paramount PicturesDirector Ken Russells thesis in 1975s ""Lisztomania"" was that classical composers were the rock stars of their day so he enlisted real rock star Roger Daltrey to mug his way through an overheated extravaganza about Franz Liszt.Warner Bros.""Bound for Glory"" a lavishly fictionalized 1976 recounting of the life of troubadour Woody Guthrie was nominated for six Oscars and won two - and it moved David Carradine briefly from a TV lead who made B movies to an unconventional movie star.United ArtistsBefore he was a made-for-TV wacko Gary Busey was a pretty fine actor - and never better than when he played the title role in 1978s ""The Buddy Holly Story"" a biopic of the 50s rock star whose life ended early.ColumbiaAs a kid Kurt Russell acted alongside Elvis Presley in ""It Happened at the Worlds Fair."" As an adult he got to act like the King of Rock n Roll in the 1979 TV miniseries ""Elvis.""Dick Clark ProductionsNo shes not actually playing Janis Joplin -- but Bette Midlers powerhouse performance in ""The Rose"" as a fearsomely talented self-destructive and very Joplin-esque singer was the closest weve gotten to Janis onscreen despite numerous recent efforts.FoxA lot of real country singers appeared in Michael Apteds 1980 Loretta Lynn biopic ""Coal Miners Daughter"" but actress Sissy Spacek took the central role (and the Oscar) after being personally chosen by Lynn.Universal""Amadeus"" (1984) took its title from Mozarts middle name and Tom Hulce was just fine as the bratty prodigy - but this is Salieris story and F. Murray Abrahams movie.Orion PicturesPar for the course in musical biopics 1985s ""Sweet Dreams"" was attacked for the liberties it took with the true story - but Jessica Lange was persuasive enough to land her fourth Oscar nomination as Patsy Cline.TriStarGary Oldman has said he doesnt like his haunted and ferocious performance as the self-destructive and ill-fated Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious in 1986s ""Sid amp; Nancy"" but most would disagree with him.Samuel GoldwynLou Diamond Phillips meanwhile burst onto the scene in 1987s ""La Bamba"" as Richie Valens another rocker who died in the same plane crash that killed Holly.ColumbiaDecades before Clint Eastwoods so-so ""Jersey Boys"" he hit the right notes with 1988s ""Bird"" his look at jazz titan Charlie Parker - and Forest Whitakers quiet but towering performance won him the Best Actor award at Cannes in 1988.Warner Bros.T Bone Burnett who worked on 1989s ""Great Balls of Fire"" which starred an over-the-top Dennis Quaid as Jerry Lee Lewis once lamented that this cartoonish romp ""made it look like the Dukes of Hazzard invented rock n roll.""Orion PicutresPerhaps the excesses of Oliver Stones 1991 film ""The Doors"" arent far removed from the excesses of its subject Jim Morrison. Val Kilmer embraces them all with deranged gusto.TriStarBoth Angela Bassett and co-star Laurence Fishburne received Oscar nominations for their roles as Tina Turner and her abusive husband Ike in 1993s ""Whats Love Got To Do With It"" and Bassett won the Golden Globe for her fierce performance in a role first offered to Whitney Houston.Buena VistaThe character is identified as ""Mentor"" in the credits of Quentin Tarantinos 1993 film ""True Romance"" but we all know (and love) the apparition played by Val Kilmer who pushes Christian Slater to stand up to Gary Oldmans dreadlocked pimp Its the ghost of Elvis of course.Warner Bros.Stephen Dorff was so impressive as original Beatles bassist Stu Sutcliffe in 1994s ""Backbeat"" that no less an authority than Paul McCartney who otherwise hated the film called him ""astonishing.""GramercyFrom a Sex Pistol to classical icon Ludwig Van Beethoven in 1994s ""Immortal Beloved"" Oldman shows the broadest range of anybody on this list. But his randy Ludwig Van isnt one of his best showcases.Sony/ColumbiaFans of the Mexican-American singer Selena were upset that a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent Jennifer Lopez was chosen for the title role in 1997s ""Selena"" - but J-Los star-making performance silenced most of the critics.Warner Bros.In 2002s wondrously weird rock n roll mummy movie ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" Bruce Campbell gives us an aging decrepit Elvis who can still gloriously kick butt.VitagraphOK we admit it We havent seen 2003s ""The Night We Called It a Day."" But Dennis Hopper as Frank Sinatra? The prospect is too weird and too delicious to ignore.ContentFilm InternationalKevin Spacey directed co-wrote and co-produced 2004 ""Beyond the Sea"" as well as starring as 50s and 60s pop singer Bobby Darin - even though Darin died at the age of 37 making the 44-year-old Spaceys performance problematic at times.Lions GateJamie Foxxs career-making Oscar-winning performance as Ray Charles in 2004s ""Ray"" launched the former ""In Living Color"" performer to a whole new level of stardom.UniversalJoaquin Phoenix didnt exactly sing like Johnny Cash in 2005s ""Walk the Line"" (no one can) but he captured some man-in-blackish essence and Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar as June Carter.FoxCate Blanchett plays one of Bob Dylans personas in Todd Haynes 2007 fascinating fantasia ""Im Not There"" while the likes of Richard Gere Ben Whishaw Christian Bale and Heath Ledger play other sides of the elusive singer-songwriter.Weinstein CompanyMarion Cotillard won the Oscar for ""La Vie en Rose"" the first movie in which many Stateside viewers saw her - not that theyd recognize her under the makeup that transformed her into tiny tortured chanteuse Edith Piaf.PicturehouseIn ""Walk Hard"" a comedy studded with cameos the brief appearance of Jack Black Paul Rudd Justin Long and Jason Schwartzman as John Paul George and Ringo was a highlight.Sony/ColumbiaPhotographer-turned-director Anton Corbijns moody black-and-white touch was just right for 2007s ""Control"" a story of the seminal post-punk band Joy Division starring Sam Riley as Ian Curtis the singer who struggled to cope with success and with life.Weinstein CompanyMichael Shannons performance as Sunset Strip Svengali Kim Fowley is the standout in the middling 2010 movie ""The Runaways""; Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning didnt particularly stand out as Joan Jett and Cherie Currie respectively.ApparitionAlan Rickman survives 2013s ""CBGB"" relatively intact as the proprietor of a legendary 70s punk dive - but the poor actors roped into standing in for the stars of the scene Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry among them dont fare nearly so well.Xlrator MediaClint Eastwood won kudos from theater fans for tapping Broadway stars for his movie adaptation of 2014s ""Jersey Boys"" but John Lloyd Young was a better singer and stage performer than actor in his performance as Frankie Valli.Warner Bros.In ""Jimi All Is By My Side"" John Ridleys upcoming unorthodox year-in-the-life Jimi Hendrix story former Outkast singer Andre Benjamin captures the spacey dreamy side of a rock icon who lived in a purple haze.Open RoadChadwick Boseman has the moves and the hair to play James Brown in ""Get On Up"" - and when youre playing the Godfather of Soul those two things will take you all the way to funkytown.UniversalEthan Hawke stars in another adventurous film about a jazz legend the Chet Baker fantasia ""Born to Be Blue."" Like Bakers music the film (and Hawkes performance) is dreamy ethereal and heartbreaking. Entertainment OneHaunted-looking and skeletal Tom Hiddleston makes a convincing Hank Williams (and a creditable country singer) in ""I Saw the Light"" but the conventional film is far more interested in drugs and booze than in Williams brilliant music.Sony Pictures Classics""Miles Ahead"" actor-director Don Cheadles unconventional film about the jazz trumpeter Miles Davis is odd and audacious - in other words the kind of movie you should make if youre going to make a movie about the revolutionary and unconventional musician.Sony Pictures ClassicsZoe Saldana is a light-skinned woman of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent which has made her casting as the dark-skinned African American singer and civil rights activist Nina Simone a highly controversial one.RLJ EntertainmentMichael Shannon plays the king of rock n roll in the upcoming ""Elvis amp; Nixon"" a comedic look at the 1970 meeting between Elvis Presley and U.S. President Richard Nixon (Kevin Spacey) at which Presley badgered Nixon into giving him a Drug Enforcement Administration badge.Tribeca Film Festival Previous ; Next 1 of 40 Tom Hiddleston Don Cheadle Ethan Hawke and Zoe Saldana are latest among the hundreds of actors whove tried playing musicians on screen The 1950s biopic ""The Glenn Miller Story"" took substantial liberties with the real story but Jimmy Stewart was persuasive enough as the star bandleader to make the movie a big hit.
